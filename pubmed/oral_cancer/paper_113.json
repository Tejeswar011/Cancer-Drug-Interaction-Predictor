Discharge teaching has been reliably evaluated using the quality of discharge teaching scale (QDTS) across several health conditions, with higher scores associated with improved parental readiness and pediatric health outcomes. This scale may be helpful in identifying areas for improvement in pediatric HSCT discharge teaching if validated in a pediatric HSCT population. Methods: This study recruited 120 caregivers of children who recently underwent HSCT to complete the QDTS along with measures of parental efficacy/control, psychological distress, and psychosocial risk factors. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the factor structure and measurement invariance of the scale, while internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha and correlations with related constructs. Results: CFA showed that the QDTS had adequate model fit and was invariant across biological sex and income, but not diagnosis. The QDTS demonstrated good internal reliability (content α = .76; delivery α = .90) and criterion validity, with significant correlations with the subscales of related constructs. Independent samples t-tests revealed that caregivers of children with malignant diagnoses reported worse quality of discharge teaching compared to those with nonmalignant diagnoses. Discussion: This study supports the use of the QDTS as a valid and reliable tool for assessing the quality of discharge teaching for caregivers of children undergoing pediatric HSCT. hematopoietic stem cell transplant discharge teaching pediatrics malignancy pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf yes pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
