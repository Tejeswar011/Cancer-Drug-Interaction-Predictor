Introduction The discovery of salicin and the subsequent synthesis of aspirin spurred the growth of a pharmaceutical industry focused on isolating and identifying pharmacologically active compounds from plants; this pursuit extended to the isolation of such drugs from herbal preparations [ 1 2 Phenolic compounds, representing a major group of water-soluble antioxidants, are aromatic secondary metabolites found abundantly in various plant parts, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, flowers, leaves, branches, and stems [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Given their diverse and crucial biological roles, the characterization of lipids is highly important for health research [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 According to the WHO 2022 data, breast cancer represents the second most diagnosed cancer type, with approximately 2.3 million new cases worldwide, and it ranks fourth in cancer-related deaths (666,103 cases). In Türkiye, a total of 25,249 new cases and 7360 deaths occurred, ranking second in incidence and fifth in mortality [ 32 33 34 35 Despite the established roles of various phenolic acids and the known iron-chelating properties of 2,3-DHBA, comprehensive information regarding its specific therapeutic mechanisms against cancer, particularly breast cancer, and its impact on cellular lipid metabolism is limited. Therefore, we aimed to, firstly, investigate the in vitro cytotoxic activity of 2,3-DHBA against human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). We next performed an untargeted lipidomic analysis by characterizing changes in the lipid profiles of these breast cancer cells following incubation with 2,3-DHBA. This approach, which has not been previously applied in this specific context, allowed us to gain novel insights into the lipid-mediated cellular responses to 2,3-DHBA in breast cancer. 2.

Discussion There is growing interest in anticarcinogenic compounds that are naturally present in plant foods. Phenolic compounds found primarily in vegetables and fruits are recognized for their diverse biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-radical, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic, antiproliferative, antiviral, chemoprotective, chemotherapeutic, and immune-enhancing properties [ 7 8 9 45 46 Salicylic acid metabolites, including 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), along with derivatives such as 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4-DHBA) and 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,6-DHBA), have been reported to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) enzyme activity against HCT-116 human colorectal carcinoma cells. Studies have shown that 2,3-DHBA and 2,6-DHBA do not inhibit CDK2 and CDK4 but effectively inhibit CDK6 activity. Another derivative, 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4,6-THBA), has been found to effectively inhibit CDK1, 2, 4, and 6 activities. Molecular docking studies have demonstrated that these compounds potentially interact with CDK1 [ 47 48 Based on these results, it was suggested that 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA may contribute to the chemoprotective properties of aspirin through CDK inhibition. Additional research by [ 49 50 50 49 50 50 50 50 50 The cytotoxic agent needs time to enter the cells and reach a concentration high enough to trigger a response. The rate of uptake can vary depending on the drug and the cell type. Lower concentrations might take longer to show an effect or might only be effective after prolonged exposure. As the exposure time increases, cells are exposed to the cytotoxic agent for longer, allowing for greater accumulation of damage, more complete inhibition of cellular processes, or the progression of cell death pathways. For many drugs, the cytotoxic effect (measured by parameters such as the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, or IC 50 Therefore, the cytotoxic activity of 2,3-DHBA on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was studied for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. It was observed that the IC 50 50 50 Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth associated with increased cell migration resulting from enhanced proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and/or enhanced ability to migrate to neighboring tissues and metastasize to distant organs. Cell proliferation requires the replication of all macromolecular components during each cell division and necessitates increased lipid biosynthesis, producing bioactive molecules that function as signaling molecules in cancer metastasis regulation through lipid catabolism [ 21 26 51 52 52 53 54 21 55 Lipid metabolism is highly complex and regulated by intricate signaling networks within cells. Enhanced understanding of lipid metabolism in cancer treatment and apoptosis could contribute to developing improved cancer therapies. Lipid metabolism in cancer cells remains largely unknown. Cancer lipidomics applications include the detection and classification of tumor cells and tissues, as well as the evaluation of anticancer therapy. Integration of lipidomic strategies into cancer research has enabled an understanding of lipid functions in biological samples and their molecular mechanisms in disease initiation and development. Additionally, altered lipid profiles in biological samples have been examined for biomarker identification in cancer research [ 56 19 57 Free fatty acids (FFAs) play key roles in numerous metabolic pathways, acting as substrates in energy metabolism and as intermediate products in signal transmission. Various potential biomarkers have been predicted for certain diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, pancreatic cancer, and autism, based on changes in peripheral blood FFA concentrations. A study using serum samples from 140 breast cancer patients and 202 healthy controls found that serum FFA concentrations in breast cancer patients were significantly decreased compared to controls [ 58 Beyond their essential role as the building blocks of cell membranes, phospholipids (PLs) are diverse molecules that actively regulate a wide array of biological functions, such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, and energy storage. Because they are central to cellular health, significant changes in the metabolism or composition of PLs in tissues or bodily fluids such as blood and urine have been linked to cancer and other pathologies. Changes in the composition, distribution, and metabolism of various PLs in cells, tissues, and bodily fluids, including blood and urine, have been associated with cancer and other diseases [ 56 Sphingolipids (SLs) are polar lipids with a sphingoid backbone containing different subgroups, including sphingomyelin (SM), sulfatides, ceramides, cerebrosides, and gangliosides. SLs function as cellular membrane components and bioactive compounds with important biological functions. Cancer cells might gain a survival advantage by changing the way they process sphingolipids. Altered sphingolipid metabolism provides a survival advantage to cancer cells by disrupting key membrane signals. The balance of ceramide, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol in lipid rafts controls pathways for apoptosis, survival, and migration. Therefore, the dysregulation of these lipids—a hallmark of cancer’s metabolic changes—can directly influence cell transformation and tumor growth [ 59 Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) are generally abundant in cell membranes and constitute an important lipid class in cancer lipidomic research. More et al. (2017) investigated potential phospholipid species that could differentiate breast cancer from benign and healthy controls in serum samples [ 60 p 61 Changes in profiles of free fatty acids (FFAs), phospholipids (PLs), and sphingolipids (SLs) have been associated with disease, suggesting that specific lipids may play roles in cancer initiation, progression, and evolution. The changes in lipid species seen in these studies are probably not isolated events. Instead, they likely reflect the widespread metabolic disruption caused by cancer, which impacts everything from gene expression to the enzymatic activities that fuel the disease’s progression. However, it is likely that the altered lipid profiles seen in these studies are a direct consequence of cancer’s underlying metabolic and enzymatic dysregulation, which is also responsible for changes in cell morphology, gene expression, and disease progression. The identification of phospholipid classes and structures represents a valuable tool for investigating lipid profile changes in cancer, providing a foundation for developing new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In our study, the effects of 2,3-DHBA on lipid profiles of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were investigated using an untargeted lipidomic approach. Treatment with 2,3-DHBA induced alterations in lipid classes, including fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, in breast cancer cells. Following 2,3-DHBA application to MCF-7 cancer cells, changes were observed in 46 fatty acid (FA), 30 glycerolipid (GL), 105 glycerophospholipid (GP), and 29 sphingolipid (SP) types ( Figure 6 Figure 7 62 63 64 62 m z m z m z m z The significant changes in the glycerolipid (GL) category reported in the manuscript, exemplified by species at m z m z 65 66 65 67 68 68 69 It was observed that the most profound lipidomic alterations induced by 2,3-DHBA occur within the sphingolipid class. The data strongly suggest that a primary mechanism of action for the compound is the strategic rearrangement of the “sphingolipid balance”—the delicate equilibrium between two key lipids: ceramide, which induces apoptosis, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP), which supports cell survival [ 70 71 72 73 74 74 m z 5. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that 2,3-DHBA, a naturally occurring phenolic acid, exerts significant dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effects against both the luminal A (MCF-7) and the more aggressive basal-like TNBC (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that 2,3-DHBA has significantly higher selectivity and is more cytotoxic against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Critically, the untargeted lipidomic analysis reveals that this cytotoxicity is inextricably linked to cell-type-specific perturbations. Following treatment with 2,3-DHBA, significant alterations were observed across all major lipid categories, including fatty acids (FAs), glycerolipids (GLs), glycophospholipids (GPs), and sphingolipids (SPs). Our findings provide a compelling case study of how this lipid-centric vulnerability can be exploited for therapeutic gain. Comprehensive analysis of the lipidomic data reveals that 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid is not only a conventional cytotoxic agent but also a significant modulator of cancer lipid metabolism. The findings suggest that 2,3-DHBA, particularly the aggressive MDA-MB-231 subtype, comprehensively rewires the cellular lipidome. This rewiring appears to result in the following: (1) compromised membrane integrity through the perturbation of glycerophospholipid composition, which likely impairs metastatic potential; (2) attenuated pro-survival signaling via the disruption of the DAG/PKC and SphK1/S1P axes; and (3) a decisive shift in the sphingolipid rheostat toward cell death, driven by the accumulation of cytotoxic ceramides. Our research will incorporate proteomic and genomic studies based on lipid types that change with anticancer activity observed following 2,3-DHBA application, demonstrating a pathway for developing targeted-lipidomics-based treatment strategies in breast cancer therapy. We can more clearly emphasize that the study serves as a foundational work and a starting point for more focused mechanistic and pathway analyses in the future.
