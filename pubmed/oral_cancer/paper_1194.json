Introduction The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family regulates angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 11 12 9 12 Figure 1 4 13 The actions of VEGF are not limited to the vascular system; VEGF plays a role in bone formation [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Obesity and T2DM often manifest with persistent inflammation and dysfunction in adipose tissue [ 30 31 32 Microvascular and macrovascular complications are the leading causes of morbidity and premature mortality among individuals with T2DM [ 33 33 34 35 The genes encoding VEGF and its associated receptors, which are involved in the angiogenesis pathway, exhibit polymorphism [ 36 37 38 VEGF 39 40 41 42 43 Some polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of complications development, contributing to higher incidence or severity of DR, DNP or DPN. Remarkably, others appear to have protective effects, reducing the likelihood or progression of such outcomes [ 44 45 20 46 47 Therefore, this scoping review aims to provide an overview of the association between polymorphisms in the VEGF 2. Methods The current review followed the recommendations outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute [ 48 49 https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MSHVQ Supplementary Material (File S1: PRISMA-ScR Checklist) 2.1. Research Strategy The research was conducted across the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases (Mach 2025), without temporal or linguistic restrictions ( Table 1 VEGF 2.2. Eligibility Criteria The eligibility criteria were based on a conceptual framework focused on polymorphisms in the VEGF Are polymorphisms in the VEGF gene and its receptors associated with susceptibility to T2DM and its complications VEGF VEGF A B C D VEGFR1 VEGFR2 VEGFR3 2.3. Study Selection The article selection process began with a search across the previously mentioned databases. All search results were imported into the Rayyan web platform, where duplicates were eliminated. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts through a blind evaluation. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were thoroughly reviewed in full to assess their suitability based on predetermined eligibility criteria. Any disagreements were resolved with the help of a third reviewer. Articles that did not meet the eligibility criteria were excluded from further consideration, and the reasons for their exclusion were meticulously documented ( Supplementary Materials—Table S1 The identification, selection, eligibility criteria, and the outcome (number of studies included and excluded) of the article election process were reported in a flowchart provided by the PRISMA-ScR platform ( Figure 2 2.4. Data Extraction Relevant data from the selected studies were compiled and presented in a detailed table ( Table 2 Figure 3 A narrative synthesis was conducted to elucidate the key findings, facilitate comparative analyses across studies, and examine possible explanations for identified discrepancies or gaps. Subsequently, the data underwent a systematic review, incorporating collaborative discussions to critically evaluate the study outcomes. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Characteristics of Included Studies The search yielded 796 references that after removing duplicates and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 517 articles were selected ( Figure 2 Supplementary Material (Table S1) The selected publications encompass a temporal range between 2006 and 2024, with a noticeable concentration of studies in recent years; 13 studies were included that were published between 2021 and 2023 ( Figure 3 VEGF VEGFR VEGFR1 VEGFR2 Figure 3 The complications associated with these SNPs were DR (49/59), T2DM (18/59), DFU (10/59), DPN (6/59), DNP (2/59), MI (2/59), DN (2/59), CRI (1/59) and CAD (1/59) ( Figure 3 VEGFA VEGFR2 Figure 3 103 VEGFA VEGFR2 104 Figure 3 Figure 3 VEGF The studies included in this scoping review employed various genotyping techniques to analyze VEGF Figure 3 105 106 107 108 109 Excepting rs1570360 and rs2010963, both in the VEGFA 110 3.2. Association Between Polymorphisms in the VEGF Gene and VEGFR2 and the Occurrence of TDM2 or Related Complications To comprehend the relationship between VEGF VEGF Among the most frequently studied SNPs, those in VEGFA VEGFR2 Table 3 To provide a clear visualization of the studied genetic variants, Figure 4 VEGFA VEGFR2 By structuring the analysis based on study prevalence and visualizing SNPs distribution within the genes, this review aims to highlight the most extensively explored genetic variants and provide insights into their potential role in diabetes pathophysiology. The upcoming sections provide an overview the characteristics of the included studies and discuss the associations identified between these polymorphisms and diabetes-related complications. 3.2.1. VEGFA The human VEGFA 111 112 113 114 115 116 112 27 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 95 128 129 130 44 70 131 132 133 VEGFA The rs2010963 (−634G/C) polymorphism, located in the 5′ UTR of the VEGFA 119 120 134 27 118 135 136 VEGF 120 This variant has been widely investigated, with heterogeneous results depending on the population and phenotype assessed. In this review, rs2010963 was the most frequently investigated SNP (31/59 studies), predominantly in association with DR, including both NPDR and PDR forms. DR is a progressive microvascular complication of DM and an essential cause of acquired blindness. There is growing evidence implicating genetic factors in susceptibility to diabetic retinopathy. Angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, are involved in the pathogenesis of DR [ 137 138 139 140 Multiple studies identified a significant association between rs2010963 and DR, with most implicating the C allele as a risk factor. In the Indian population, Suganthalakshmi et al. (2006) found the GC genotype increased DR risk (OR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.24–4.36) [ 50 55 44 p 69 79 In East Asian populations, Yang et al. (2010) reported an association between the CC genotype and DR in Chinese patients, while Chen et al. (2016) confirmed that the C allele correlated with DR and higher serum VEGFA levels [ 61 77 91 In European ancestry populations, results have been mixed. Errera et al. (2007) identified the CC genotype as an independent risk factor for PDR in Brazilian patients of European ancestry (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.01–3.79; p 51 53 34 54 60 72 141 61 70 Although rs2010963 emerged as the most frequently investigated SNP in this review, particularly in relation to DR, it was not the exclusive focus of all studies. This polymorphism has also been examined for associations with other diabetic complications, including MI, DFU, DNP, DPN. For MI, the major macrovascular complication of diabetes characterized by plaque rupture, thrombosis, and myocardial necrosis, with VEGFA implicated in vascular remodeling, endothelial dysfunction, and plaque instability contributing to its pathogenesis [ 142 p 52 Li and coworkers (2018) found that the CC genotype was less frequent among DFU patients (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.17–0.77; p 85 85 DNP is a complication of DM that affects the renal microvasculature. In individuals with diabetes, there is an increase in the glomerular filtration rate, or hyperfiltration, which is driven by a greater relaxation of the afferent arterioles compared to the efferent arterioles. This leads to elevated blood flow through the glomerular capillaries, increasing pressure. Over time, these conditions result in glomerular hypertrophy and an expansion of the glomerular capillary surface area. These hemodynamic alterations contribute to the disease’s onset and progression [ 143 144 p 34 66 Luo and collaborators (2019) reported a slightly increased risk with the G allele (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.03–1.30) in Chinese patients, although overall evidence for rs2010963 in DPN remains limited [ 36 92 75 145 146 In summary, rs2010963 appears to contribute to the risk of PDR and DR in specific populations through increased VEGFA expression mediated by the C allele. Interestingly, the same variant that promotes pathological angiogenesis in DR may also exacerbate vascular complications in coronary arteries, increasing susceptibility to MI. Conversely, it may exert a protective effect in DFU by enhancing wound healing via angiogenesis, while its associations with T2DM itself, DNP, or DPN remain inconclusive. The variability in findings across studies highlights the complex interplay between genetic background, environmental factors, and disease phenotype, underscoring the need for further large-scale, multi-ethnic studies and functional analyses to clarify its mechanistic pathways and potential clinical significance in risk stratification and personalized management of diabetic complications. VEGFA The rs699947 (−2578C/A) polymorphism, located at the −2578 translation start sites in the promoter region of the VEGFA 147 117 118 122 For DFU, several studies have highlighted a protective effect of the A allele. Amoli et and collaborators (2011) observed that the AA genotype was less frequent among DFU patients in Iran [ 63 98 148 Regarding DR, findings are more heterogeneous. Chun and colleagues (2010) in Korea reported that the A allele increased DR risk, with the C allele possibly exerting a protective role [ 60 100 34 61 78 Beyond microvascular complications, in the context of T2DM and its systemic manifestations, Elfaki and collaborators (2021) in Sudan found that individuals with the CA genotype had altered lipid profiles and increased cardiovascular risk, suggesting a broader metabolic impact of this SNP beyond local vascular complications [ 40 In summary, the rs699947 variant demonstrates population and phenotype specific associations with diabetic complications. The A allele is consistently reported as protective against DFU in multiple studies, whereas its role in DR remains controversial, with studies showing both risk and protective effects. The CC genotype, associated with higher VEGFA expression, may predispose individuals to vascular damage, whereas the CA genotype has been implicated in dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic variants and diabetes-related complications, reinforcing the need for further functional studies to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations. VEGFA The rs3025039 (+936 C/T) is in the VEGFA 149 150 56 124 151 The rs3025039 polymorphism has been widely investigated in relation to diabetes and its complications, with varying results across different populations among 15 of 59 studies concentrating on T2DM and associated complications, but predominantly assessing its association with DR. The T allele demonstrated heterogeneous associations. In DR, a study reported the T allele and TT genotype as risk factors associated with higher VEGF levels, while Choudhury and colleagues (2015) found the T allele increased PDR risk in Indian patients [ 44 57 41 55 70 75 94 45 83 86 98 Regarding T2DM, Imbaby and colleagues (2021) found the CT genotype associated with increased T2DM risk in Egyptian patients, although no association was observed with DPN [ 92 95 Overall, the T allele tends to be protective in DPN and some DR studies, but appears to increase risk in PDR, NPDR, and certain DR populations, highlighting population-specific and phenotype-dependent effects. Its functional link to reduced VEGF expression suggests it may modulate angiogenic responses differently across tissues and disease stages. In summary, while the rs3025039 variant demonstrates inconsistent associations with T2DM and its complications across studies, it appears to play a more pronounced role in microvascular complications such as PDR and DR. The T allele and TT genotype may confer risk or protection depending on the specific complication and population, underscoring the need for further research to clarify these relationships and their underlying mechanisms. VEGFA The rs833061 (−460C>T) polymorphism is a C>T SNP at position −460 of the VEGFA 152 153 Khan and colleagues (2020) demonstrated a significant association between the rs833061 variant and the early stages of DR in Pakistani patients, identifying the C allele as a major risk factor. This allele is associated with increased VEGF activity, which may drive the development of microvascular complications by enhancing angiogenesis and vascular permeability [ 89 99 VEGFA 61 p 73 67 73 53 70 53 70 74 For DFU, results were mixed. Zhuang et al. (2017) (China) reported a significant association between rs833061 and DFU risk [ 82 87 Regarding chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), Tiwari et al. (2009) (India) found the CT genotype significantly increased CRI risk (OR = 2.23), suggesting a broader role for rs833061 beyond ocular complications [ 59 87 Overall, the C allele appears to increase VEGF expression, enhancing angiogenesis and vascular permeability—key mechanisms driving DR and potentially other vascular complications in diabetes. Some studies also suggest the T allele may promote VEGFA overexpression through distinct pathways, highlighting complex regulatory dynamics where both alleles could modulate disease risk differently depending on context. In summary, the rs833061 polymorphism in the VEGFA VEGFA The rs1570360 (−1154G/A) polymorphism, located in the promoter region of the VEGFA 147 117 118 119 122 123 154 Among these studies, Choudhury and collaborators (2015), conducted in an Indian population, reported a significant association between the AA genotype and increased risk of PDR, suggesting that this variant could enhance VEGFA expression, and promote pathological angiogenesis characteristic of advanced DR [ 44 70 Similarly, Chun et al. (2010) in Korea, Chen et al. (2019) in Taiwan, Khan et al. (2020) and Qayyum et al. (2023) in Pakistan reported no significant association between rs1570360 and DR or T2DM, highlighting inter-population differences [ 60 89 100 155 82 These findings suggest that while the AA genotype may be a risk factor for PDR in specific populations, particularly in India, its role remains inconclusive across other ethnic groups, and it shows no significant association with DFU. This variability may reflect differences in genetic background, linkage disequilibrium with other functional variants, environmental influences, or limited statistical power in individual studies. Additionally, other contributing factors include small sample sizes (leading to insufficient statistical power), variability in complication type, and the lack of correction for multiple testing when assessing associations with more than one SNP. These issues increase the risk of chance correlations, which must be interpreted considering biological plausibility and the functional relevance of the variant studied [ 156 117 VEGFA The rs13207351 (−1190A/G) polymorphism is located at the promoter region of the VEGFA 157 157 158 This variant has been investigated in 4 studies included in this review. In a study conducted in a Chinese population, the AA genotype was significantly associated with increased DR risk (OR = 3.76, 95% CI: 1.21–11.71), suggesting that this promoter variant may enhance VEGFR2 expression, thereby potentiating VEGF signaling and pathological angiogenesis characteristic of DR [ 64 p 73 Conversely, Khan and colleagues (2020), found no association between rs13207351 and NPDR, PDR, or T2DM in a Pakistani population, highlighting possible ethnic differences in allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium patterns, or environmental interactions [ 89 85 In summary, the rs13207351 polymorphism of the VEGFA VEGFA The rs2146323 (+5092C/A) polymorphism is an intronic variant located 111 bp 5′ of exon 3 within the VEGFA 159 159 However, functional predictions for rs2146323 suggest a limited regulatory impact. The variant is relatively distant from known transcription factor binding sites, and it does not alter predicted exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motifs or affect exon splicing. For these reasons, it has been considered a less likely candidate for functional significance. Supporting this, a Finnish case–control study found no association between rs2146323 and the severity of DR [ 159 Despite these considerations, two studies included in this review—both conducted in Chinese populations—reported a significant association between rs2146323 and DR. Yang and colleagues (2011) reported a significant association between the AA genotype and increased risk of DR. Their findings suggested that carriers of the A allele, particularly those with the AA genotype, may be more susceptible to the vascular changes underlying DR. This finding was further supported in which was found a higher frequency of the AA genotype among DR patients compared to controls, reinforcing the role of rs2146323 in DR susceptibility [ 64 73 Although these findings are limited to a single ethnic group, they suggest that rs2146323 may contribute to the development of diabetic microvascular complications through subtle regulatory effects on VEGFA expression. Additional research in other populations, as well as functional assays, will be essential to clarify the biological significance of this variant. VEGFA The rs25648 (−7C>T) is in the 5′ UTR of the VEGFA VEGFA 160 161 p 50 Conversely, Amoli and coworkers (2011) evaluated Iranian patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and found no significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between cases and controls [ 63 In summary, while preliminary evidence suggests a possible association between rs25648 and DR, the current data is limited and inconsistent. The lack of association with DFU in another cohort supports the notion of phenotype specificity. Further studies in diverse populations, including functional analyses, are needed to clarify the regulatory role of this SNP in VEGFA expression and its clinical relevance in diabetic complications. VEGFA The rs10434 (+1612G/A), located in the 3′ UTR in the VEGFA 122 56 The G allele of rs10434 was significantly associated with sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Specifically, the presence of the G allele conferred a higher risk (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3–5.3; p 56 Conversely, Fattah and colleagues (2016) found no significant association between rs10434 and DR in an Egyptian population, indicating that the effect of this SNP might be population-specific or modulated by other genetic and environmental factors [ 78 In summary, while rs10434 has been implicated in the development of severe DR, the overall contribution remains inconclusive due to conflicting evidence. Further studies in diverse populations are necessary to clarify its role and potential as a genetic biomarker for DR susceptibility. VEGFA The rs3025021 polymorphism is in intron 6 of the VEGFA NM_003376.5 This SNP was evaluated in two independent studies, with conflicting results. In a study conducted in an Australian population, the C allele of rs3025021 was significantly associated with blinding DR. The authors reported that individuals carrying the C allele had an increased risk (OR = 3.8; 95% CI: 1.5–10.0; p 56 In contrast, in a Mexican cohort, no association between rs3025021 and PDR was observed. The lack of association in this population may be due to genetic heterogeneity, differences in environmental exposure, study design, or sample size limitations [ 141 Taken together, these findings indicate that rs3025021 may be a risk marker for severe forms of DR, but its role appears to be population dependent. Further studies are needed to clarify its biological relevance and to assess whether this polymorphism exerts functional effects on VEGFA VEGFA The rs3025020 (−583C/T) is located in intron 6 region, specifically, is a C/T substitution at position -583 relative to the transcription start site of the VEGFA 162 124 163 Only one study has evaluated the role of rs3025020 in the context of T2DM and its complications. According to Omar and colleagues (2022), the T allele was associated with increased risk for diabetic complications, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.67 (95% CI: 1.03–6.91; p 95 Although evidence is limited, these preliminary findings indicate that rs3025020 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to diabetes-related vascular complications. Further studies are warranted to confirm its association and to elucidate its potential regulatory function in VEGFA expression and diabetic pathogenesis. VEGFA The rs3025035 polymorphism is in intron 7 of the VEGFA 81 Given the limited evidence and absence of functional studies, the relevance of rs3025035 in diabetic complications remains unclear. Further research, including replication studies in other ethnic groups and functional analyses, is needed to determine whether this variant contributes to VEGFA regulation or microvascular pathogenesis in diabetes. VEGFA The rs6921438 located at 171 kb downstream of the VEGFA 129 According to Bonnefond and colleagues (2013), the G allele of rs6921438, previously linked to higher VEGF levels in the general population, conferred an increased risk of T2DM and DR in the French population. However, this association was not replicated in the Danish population [ 68 22 164 A recent study conducted in a Slovenian population found that the G allele was protective against DN (OR = 0.51, p 102 VEGFA Taken together, these findings suggest that rs6921438 may influence the risk of diabetic microvascular outcomes in a population-specific manner. The G allele appears to act as a risk allele for T2DM and DR in certain groups, while it may confer protection against DN in others. Further research, particularly functional studies, is warranted to clarify its molecular mechanisms and to determine whether it may serve as a biomarker for disease risk or therapeutic response. VEGFA The rs833069 (+450T/C) is located in intron 2 of the VEGFA 165 VEGFA 166 Abdelghany and colleagues (2021) demonstrated no significant association between rs833069 and the risk of T2DM or DR in their study population suggesting a limited role in disease progression [ 90 167 168 3.2.2. VEGFR2 The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), also referred to as kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), is the primary receptor for VEGFA and is essential for angiogenesis and vascular permeability [ 9 10 9 The VEGFR2 169 170 VEGFR2 71 78 171 172 173 174 VEGFR2 The polymorphism rs2071559 (−604T/C) at the −604 located in the promoter region of the VEGFR2 175 A total of 6 studies in this review evaluated rs2071559 in relation to various diabetic complications. Regarding DR, Yang and collaborators (2014) found a significant association between rs2071559 and DR, reporting that individuals carrying the CC genotype had an increased risk for developing the condition [ 73 44 74 80 For macrovascular disease, Kariz and colleagues (2014) reported that the CC genotype was significantly more frequent among diabetic patients with MI than those without coronary artery disease (CAD), indicating a 1.6-fold increased risk for MI (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1–2.1; p p 71 80 102 Remarkably, certain cohorts have reported that individuals carrying the CC genotype demonstrate higher circulating levels of VEGF, which aligns with an increased angiogenic drive in specific vascular beds, such as ocular or macrovascular areas. In contrast, within the cutaneous wound microenvironment of individuals with T2DM, research indicates a diminished induction of VEGFA and VEGFR2 signaling, leading to impaired angiogenesis and delayed wound healing. These observations highlight the context-dependent dysregulation of the VEGF axis across various tissues and compartments. In summary, the rs2071559 variant in VEGFR2 VEGFR2 The VEGFR2 2 176 177 Abdelghany and collaborators (2021) did not observe any significant association between rs2305948 and susceptibility to DR or T2DM in the Egyptians. However, they noted this variant had previously been linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and response to anti-VEGF therapy in other populations, indicating possible context- and disease-specific roles [ 90 Supporting a potential vascular role, other authors found that the C allele of rs2305948 was significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN), further implicating this variant in microvascular complications of diabetes [ 102 Taken together, these findings suggest that the rs2305948 polymorphism may contribute to vascular complications in diabetes, particularly DN, potentially through its impact on VEGF receptor function and downstream signaling. However, its role in DR remains unclear, and the observed variability across studies may be influenced by population-specific genetic backgrounds and environmental factors. Further functional and large-scale association studies are necessary to confirm its pathogenic relevance and utility as a biomarker. 3.2.3. VEGFR1 The VEGFR1(Flt 178 179 VEGF1 179 7 7 180 VEGFR1 The rs7993418 is a synonymous T/C SNP located in VEGFR1 181 182 181 183 90 In the study of Abdelghany and collaborators (2021), a significant association was observed between the G allele of rs7993418 and susceptibility to T2DM and DR. This suggests that this polymorphism may modulate VEGFR1-mediated signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes-related microvascular complications [ 90 Despite being the only study available in this review addressing this SNP, the findings highlight its potential as a genetic biomarker. However, additional studies across diverse populations and functional analyses are needed to confirm its role and mechanism of action in diabetic complications. 3.2.4. VEGFB The vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB 184 185 VEGFB The rs12366035 C/T variant, which is a synonymous variant located in exon 5 [ 186 187 188 The study by Abdelghany and collaborators (2021) highlights that the T allele is associated with a higher susceptibility to developing T2DM and confers an increased risk for DR progression. However, due to the limited number of studies on each polymorphism, further research is necessary to validate these associations and elucidate the underlying genetic mechanisms, particularly in diverse populations [ 90 3.2.5. VEGFC The VEGFC 184 189 189 190 VEGFC The rs7664413 polymorphism is located on intron 5 of the VEGFC 191 In the only study identified in this review, Abdelghany and collaborators (2021) investigated the rs7664413 variant and reported a significant association between the T allele and increased susceptibility to DR and T2DM. These findings suggest that rs7664413 may act as a genetic risk factor by influencing VEGFC expression and, consequently, vascular function and inflammation [ 90 Despite the promising association, the evidence remains limited to a single study, and further research is necessary to validate these findings in different populations and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Functional studies are also essential to determine whether this variant directly impacts VEGFC expression and contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular complications. 3.2.6. Other Polymorphisms Although the polymorphism rs10738760 is located on chromosome 9p24.2, between the VLDLR KCNV2 129 The polymorphism rs10738760 showed no significant link to diabetes or its complications. This polymorphism, located near the VEGFA 68 22 164 3.3. Expert Opinion and Future Perspectives The studies included in this scoping review offer significant insights into the role of VEGF Figure 5 Additionally, as suggested in some studies [ 68 164 192 193 Looking ahead, there is significant potential for translating data on VEGF VEGF Moreover, translating VEGF Ultimately, the successful translation of these findings into clinical practice relies on the development of clinically actionable genetic tests. For these tests to be truly beneficial, they must be cost-effective, accurate, and easily accessible for routine screening. Considering the growing importance of genetic testing in personalized medicine, it is crucial to demonstrate the clinical utility of VEGF To our knowledge, this scoping review is the first to comprehensively map polymorphisms across the VEGF signaling pathway in relation to complications of T2DM. By summarizing the most frequently studied variants and their putative links to micro- and macrovascular outcomes, it consolidates a fragmented literature and identifies key gaps, particularly the need for broader ancestral representation and methodological standardization. Consistent with the remit of scoping reviews, we mapped the evidence base without formal quality appraisal or quantitative synthesis; accordingly, we did not establish direct correlations between VEGF VEGFR 4. Conclusions This scoping review highlights the significant role of VEGF VEGFA Based on the descriptive evidence mapping, rs3025039 has more often been reported in association with DR/PDR than with T2DM susceptibility per se; however, findings for T2DM are heterogeneous, and some studies have suggested a higher risk for the TT genotype. Similarly, the rs2010963 SNP has been linked to increased VEGF expression, which could promote vascular permeability and contribute to microvascular complications. On the other hand, rs699947 has demonstrated protective effects in some populations against diabetic foot complications but has also been associated with increased VEGF expression, which could contribute to retinal complications. Other polymorphisms, such as VEGFA VEGFR2 VEGFA VEGFB 90 From a clinical perspective, these polymorphisms may serve as potential biomarkers to identify individuals at higher risk for developing microvascular or macrovascular complications, allowing for earlier surveillance and targeted interventions. Furthermore, insights into VEGF-related pathways may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including precision medicine approaches aimed at modulating angiogenesis in susceptible individuals. Integrating genetic information into risk assessment models could ultimately improve individualized management and reduce the burden of diabetes-related complications. Overall, these findings underscore the complexity of the genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM and its complications. Although some SNPs show promising associations, inconsistencies among studies highlight the need for further research with larger and more diverse populations to validate these findings. Future investigations should also focus on functional studies to elucidate the biological mechanisms through which these polymorphisms modulate VEGF expression and contribute to disease progression. Understanding these genetic associations could provide valuable insights for developing personalized medicine approaches to mitigate the risk and severity of diabetic complications.
