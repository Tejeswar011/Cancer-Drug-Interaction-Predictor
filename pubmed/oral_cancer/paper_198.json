Introduction Anemia represents a common and clinically relevant complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases, especially in CKD stages 3–5. The estimated presence of anemia among advanced CKD patients stands between 50% and 60%. The mechanisms are decreased EPO production, iron deficiency, inflammation, and shortened erythrocyte lifespan [ 1 2 3 4 In iron-related disorders, iron deficiency is paramount to anemic episodes in CKD and may occur as either absolute (depleted iron stores) or functional (inability to utilize stored iron due to inflammation or chronic disease) [ 5 6 7 8 9 11 Recent findings have cemented the fact that there is a complex interplay between anemia and CKD anemia being not only a result of CKD but in fact acting as an exacerbator of the renal decline rate [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Notwithstanding the signs of improvement in the management of CKD anemia, much knowledge is still lacking, especially in regard to the synergistic effect of iron deficiency and ESA therapy on kidney function trajectory. Most of the previous studies have been on hemodialysis populations, and there are scarce data concerning predialysis CKD patients in low-resource settings. This study therefore intends to examine the influence of iron deficiency and ESA therapy on anemia correction and CKD progression among patients with stage 3–5 CKD, thus addressing a critical gap in both regional and global nephrology practice. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Setting This prospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Nephrology, at a tertiary institution, between January 2023 and December 2024. 2.2. Study Population CKD stages 3–5 patients attending the nephrology outpatient clinic were enrolled consecutively. Eligible participants were at least 18-plus years old and informed consent was taken. 2.3. Study Design and Study Period The research consisted of a 24-month prospective observational cohort study. Patients were subclassified under anemia treatments for comparative analyses. This was, therefore, a prospective observational cohort study rather than a RCT. Hence, patients were categorized based on iron status at baseline, as well as on treatments ordered by the attending physician in routine care. No experimental intervention was allocated by the study investigators; thus, registration of a clinical trial would not have applied or been required for that matter. The study was compliant with STROBE guidelines for observational research [ 24 2.4. Sample Size Determination With an anticipated moderate effect size (Cohen's d 2.5. Sampling Method A consecutive sampling approach was used where all eligible participants who consented for the study were enrolled. 2.6. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria involved adult CKD patients with stages 3–5 with documented anemia (Hb < 12 g/dL for females, < 13 g/dL for males) and complete baseline data. Exclusion criteria involved patients with malignancy, active infection, recent blood transfusion (< 3 months), or those on dialysis at baseline. 2.7. Data Collection Data collection was done through enrollment of patients during follow-up visits at the Nephrology Outpatient Clinic. Upon giving informed consent, baseline demographic data, medical history, and clinical parameters were collected using standardized patient case report forms (CRFs). 2.7.1. Blood Sample Collection Venous blood was aseptically drawn from the antecubital vein blood using sterile EDTA vacutainer tubes (for complete blood count [CBC]) and plain tubes (for serum iron studies) following standard procedure of phlebotomy. All blood collection took place in early morning hours (between 08:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.) to avoid diurnal variations, particularly in serum iron levels. 2.7.2. Laboratory Analysis Hemoglobin and CBC: Analysis was done through an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN-1000, Sysmex Corporation, Japan). Quality controls were conducted by calibration using commercial control materials on a daily basis. Serum ferritin: These were quantified by chemiluminescent immunoassay on the Roche Cobas e411 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Tests were run following the instructions of the manufacturer. TSAT: Calculated from serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). These were measured using a colorimetric method on the Beckman Coulter AU480 analyzer Renal function assessment: Serum creatinine was analyzed using the enzymatic method on the Beckman Coulter AU480. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-EPI 2021 formula, standardized for age, sex, and race. All assays were conducted in an ISO-certified central hospital laboratory. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [ 25 25 26 2.8. Data Documentation and Follow-Up All patients were followed at 3-month intervals for 6 months. At each subsequent visit, hemoglobin, iron indices (ferritin and TSAT), and eGFR were measured once more by the same methods to maintain consistency. These follow-up visits were also the times when adverse events or clinical status changes were recorded. Data were entered into a password-protected database, with research staff in charge of the data entry, and accuracy was checked by a second reviewer; in cases of discrepancies, a review of the source documents ensued. 2.9. Data Analysis and Interpretation Statistical analysis was performed using R Version 4.5.1. Continuous variables were expressed as means ± SD, and categorical variables were given as percentages and frequencies. ANOVA and chi-square tests were conducted to image group comparisons. The level of Pearson's coefficient was able to identify correlations between hemoglobin and annual eGFR decline. p 2.10. Ethical Approval and Consent to Participate The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (ISERC/KTRH/0771/23). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. As this was an observational cohort study, no clinical trial registration number applies. 3. Results For the study, a total of 120 patients with CKD stages 3–5 were enrolled. Anemia was diagnosed in 65 patients (54.2%) according to the WHO and KDIGO 2021 guideline definition of Hb < 13 g/dL for males and < 12 g/dL for females. Patients were stratified into three groups based on iron status and ESA therapy: Group 1: iron-deficient, no ESA therapy ( n n n 3.1. Baseline Characteristics  Table 1 3.2.

Progression to ESRD During the follow-up: 6 patients in Group 1 (15%) progressed to ESRD and required renal replacement therapy.

Correlation Between Hemoglobin and eGFR Decline A moderate positive correlation was observed between final hemoglobin levels and eGFR at 6 months ( r p 1 2 r p 4. Discussion The research looks into the relationship between anemia, iron supplementation, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and the progression of CKD. Our results demonstrates that there is a definite positive correlation between hemoglobin levels and eGFR indicating that lower hemoglobin values become associated with higher stages of CKD. In addition, patients receiving the concomitant therapies of iron supplementation and ESAs showed superior hemoglobin correction and slower decline in renal function relative to the other patients who received either one of the treatments or none. Anemia is a common, multifactorial complication due to CKD but is mainly attributable to insufficient erythropoietin production, iron deficiency, and chronic inflammation [ 27 28 8 9 10 11 Our data fortify the concept of early correction of anemia in CKD patients, particularly with the combined treatment of iron supplementation and ESA therapy, in retarding CKD progression. Several studies strongly emphasize the ill effects of persistent anemia on renal hemodynamics, oxidative stress, and myocardial remodeling, which together accentuate renal decline and cardiovascular morbidity in CKD patients [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 This study further strengthens the available evidence showing iron therapy, especially when combined with ESAs, as being effective in the clinical settings of a low-resource context. In contrast to the CHOIR and TREAT trials done in high-resource settings, our study was set to mimic routine clinical care in a public tertiary hospital, thereby enhancing the generalizability of the findings in similar contexts. We also noted that as advanced CKD is present, anemia prevalence significantly increases. This further backs the studies that anemia is not only a consequence of faster CKD progression but also precipitates it by way of tissue hypoxia, oxidative stress, and cardiac remodeling [ 37 38 39 40 40 41 4.1. Clinical Implications This study highlights the importance of diagnosing and correcting anemia in CKD early using treatment based on the available guidelines. Timely iron supplementation with appropriate assessment of iron status and judicious administration of ESAs can slow down renal function decline, enhance the patient's quality of life, and diminish the burden of transfusions. 4.2. Limitations Several limitations matter in this study. First, it was a single-center observational study with quite a modest size, which may compromise external validity. Second, randomization was not done, and treatment groups followed available clinical practices, introducing potential confounding. Third, adherence to therapy and bioavailability of iron were not assessed, largely owing to the fact that predominance of oral iron limits interpretation on the comparative efficacy of different iron formulations. Randomized controlled trials in resource-limited settings are needed to evaluate the optimal combination and dosing regimen of iron and ESA therapy in CKD patients. Furthermore, long-term studies on cardiovascular outcomes and on the cost-effectiveness of these treatments must be undertaken. 5. Conclusion In brief, this study shows that anemia is significantly associated with progression of CKD and that the combination of iron supplementation with ESA therapy has a more favorable outcome on the improvement of hemoglobin and stabilization of renal function than either treatment alone. Thus, in light of these findings, early management of anemia in CKD patients through a separate individualized approach must be emphasized according to available scientific evidence and based on local availability of resources.
