Introduction In recent years, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted growing attention due to their remarkable antimicrobial activity, which spans antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. These properties are largely attributed to mechanisms such as disruption of microbial membranes, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and interference with essential cellular proteins [ 1 2 + 3 4 AgNPs can be incorporated into polymeric hydrogels. Hydrogels, three-dimensional, water-swollen polymer networks (both natural and synthetic), serve as excellent matrices for AgNPs due to their tunable porosity, mechanical properties, and biodegradability [ 5 6 Escherichia coli 3 7 8 AgNPs can also be incorporated into polymeric membranes for food applications. In food science, the incorporation of AgNPs into polymeric membranes has gained attraction for active packaging, aimed at inhibiting spoilage and enhancing shelf life. For instance, biopolymer-based films, integrating AgNPs, significantly suppressed microbial growth in packaged fresh produce, dairy, and meat as reported by [ 9 10 11 5 6 9 In tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, scaffolds play a crucial role in mimicking extracellular matrices. The incorporation of AgNPs into these scaffolds adds an antimicrobial function, reducing infection risk during the critical early stages of cell proliferation and tissue regeneration [ 8 Several recent journal articles present original research into AgNPs-loaded polymeric systems, but our review focuses exclusively on the recent primary literature, aiming to clarify synthesis methods and applications of AgNPs–polymer composites, to highlight the structure–function relationships, especially in biomedical and food contexts, to examine performance metrics, toxicity assessments, and mechanistic insights from real-world applications. Moreover, this paper presents a discussion on the challenges and future perspectives, including regulatory landscapes and safety paradigms. Previous reviews have primarily focused on broad overviews of AgNPs in nanomedicine, polymer nanocomposites in general [ 12 13 2. Fundamentals of Silver Nanoparticles The remarkable results in the field of nanotechnology led to an increased interest in researchers’ activity. Nanoparticles, a quite impressive domain of nanotechnology, possess important properties across various applications. The domain of nanoparticles is used for medical purposes, in biomedical engineering, food packaging, water treatment, environmental applications, and even electronics and automotive industries [ 14 Silver nanoparticles are small particles with dimensions in a range of 1–100 nm with multiple properties. Their innovative properties have gained society’s attention; therefore, various studies and materials have been developed lately. AgNPs have superior chemical, physical, and biological properties, especially due to their structure and crystallinity in their nanometric form and size [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 22 23 23 In addition to biosensors, AgNPs are attached to various polymer matrices for a more controlled release or to improve their stability. Depending on the application, AgNPs can be found in soft materials, for example, hydrogels or scaffolds, but also in hard biomaterials, like those for bone regeneration or 4D printed materials. Despite their good optical and antibacterial properties, their stability in solution is an issue which is addressed lately by the scientific community. Their integration in hydrogels and membranes decreases the possibility of agglomeration, while their physical properties are maintained for longer periods of time. Many reviews and research articles state the impact of the size, shape, or morphology on AgNPs’ physical, optical, and biological properties [ 15 In AgNPs fabrication, the reducing/stabilizing agents play the most important role since they have a strong impact on the final properties of the material. Therefore, in recent years, different synthesis techniques were proposed for AgNPs used as plasmonic particles or embedded in a polymeric matrix for further applications. The next subchapters will briefly discuss the main synthesis techniques for AgNPs and properties since the main focus of this work is to the AgNPs–polymer materials. Furthermore, we already published a review dedicated only to the AgNPs [ 24 2.1. Synthesis Techniques for AgNPs Currently, various techniques are applied to obtain AgNPs in the desired sizes and forms. The main three categories are physical, chemical, and biological methods. Physical and chemical syntheses are more classical, while biological methods, known also as green chemistry, are a more recent approach in which biological structures are used to obtain AgNPs. The formation of AgNPs can be obtained using top-down and bottom-up approaches [ 25 Figure 1 26 Top-down approach relies on the formation of AgNPs from a bulk material usually using physical methods and forces, such as crushing, grinding, or milling [ 26 27 The most applicable physical techniques are laser ablation [ 28 29 30 4 31 31 32 32 33 3 Thymus vulgaris Sambucus nigra Thymus serpyllum 33 Bottom-up approaches involve a different technique for AgNPs fabrication. Based on chemical and biological syntheses, bottom-up methods rely on molecules and atoms which, through the nucleation and aggregation process, achieve the nanometric size of the particle. This approach forms complex aggregates starting from metallic salt precursor with the help of reducing agents and stabilizing reagents. The reduction agents can be a chemical reagent or an active compound from a biological source. Its role is to reduce the metallic precursor into final nanoparticles stabilized through the stabilizing agent which will ensure a stable surface of the final particles. This stability will avoid aggregation and will maintain their efficiency for further applications. Chemical and biological syntheses offer high yield of reaction, they are cost-effective, they do not need complex equipment, and they can be obtained with limited resources, especially for the biological methods where the sources are natural and can be easily procured. As is illustrated in the figure above, the common chemical routes are chemical reduction [ 34 35 36 37 38 38 39 Staphylococcus aureus 39 40 Green synthesis, the innovation of classical chemical synthesis, is an eco-friendly approach in which biological extracts or micro-organisms are used as bioreducing agents in AgNPs formation. Figure 2 3 26 41 42 43 Ficus sycomorus 43 44 Salvia sclarea 44 2.2. Physicochemical Properties of AgNPs The versatility of AgNPs is sustained by their incredible optical, electronic, and biological properties. These nanoparticles exhibit surface plasmons resonance (SPR) in which electrons are conducted at specific wavelengths depending on the size and shape of the particles. This important feature is the basis in biosensors development and imaging techniques; therefore, the addition of AgNPs in such smart devices has increased a lot lately [ 45 45 46 For biological activity, the focus of this review, the size and the shape are also the main properties to be considered in the synthesis process. AgNPs can be found in various shapes like spherical, triangular, cubic, and hexagonal [ 4 47 Escherichia coli 47 48 49 50 Staphylococcus aureus 50 51 51 Table 1 2.3. Antimicrobial and Biological Activity For polymeric systems, the biological mechanism of AgNPs is based on the release of the particles and ions from the matrix based on their diffusion rate. The incorporation of AgNPs in polymer matrices such as hydrogels, scaffolds, membranes, or films in a promising strategy to improve their stability and to create support for their better delivery. The antimicrobial and biological activity of AgNPs described further is similar once they are in contact with tissues, cultures, or biological structures regardless of their encapsulation method (in suspensions or incorporated into polymers). Many studies in the literature claim an improvement in the stability and release of AgNPs and Ag + 58 + 59 + + + 59 + 60 + + 60 The mechanism of AgNPs has been studied for years; however, the complexity of their cytotoxic effect is still unclear. Lately, it has been observed that AgNPs penetrate the bacterial membrane first, as can be observed in Figure 3 Once the membrane is disrupted, the cell begins to function unproperly, and the ROS appears to lead to enzyme inhibition and DNA damage. More specifically, upon endocytosis or direct penetration of the membrane, AgNPs will undergo oxidation by O 2 + + 62 + 63 63 64 63 65 66 67 68 68 In case of bacteria, Ag + 1 61 69 70 Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Escherichia coli Salmonella enterica Brassica nigra Lavandula angustifolia 70 71 Allium cepa aggregatum Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli 71 3. Polymeric Matrices for AgNPs Incorporation Polymeric matrices are classified as natural or synthetic depending on the polymer type chosen for the final application. Natural polymers are known for their abundance in nature, their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, and their ability to stimulate tissue regeneration in the implantation area. Nevertheless, they are easy to work with and, in most cases, they can be combined with multiple other materials to improve the final properties. On the other hand, synthetic materials are mainly fabricated in the laboratory. Their main role is to offer better stability and mechanical properties for the final material. In biomedical and food applications, they are combined with natural polymers to assure both high biocompatibility as well as good mechanical and thermal stability in time. 3.1. Natural Polymers Natural polymers are used in biomedical applications due to their natural state. They are components of biological systems with the purpose of restoring the essential functions of injured areas. In addition to the well-known biomedical applications, natural polymers found activity also in the food industry, especially in food packaging. Natural polymers possess many advantages; however, their major benefit remains the high biocompatibility. They have minimal side effects, increase the regeneration in tissues and organs, and improve the material tolerance of the human body. Even though they offer such excellent biological properties, natural polymers have poor stability and mechanical properties. They are stable in specific media for short periods of time, and they degrade very fast. They are able to offer support for minimal injuries; however, for deeper wounds or more complex situations, the addition of a synthetic polymer is necessary. Natural polymers are extracted from organic sources, usually from micro-organisms, plants, animals, or algae [ 72 73 Figure 4 74 Cellulose, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, and alginate are the most studied polymers for biomedical applications. Their very high similarity with natural tissues and their ability to form hydrogels, dressings, or scaffolds led to the fabrication of many composites with AgNPs. In most cases, all these polymers offer support for easier administration of AgNPs. Cellulose, a linear chain of 2 d-glucose units linked by β-1-4 glycosidic bonds [ 75 74 76 77 78 79 80 Many reports state the fabrication of hydrogels and membranes with natural polymers and AgNPs. For instance, Lei et al. [ 81 Staphylococcus aureus 81 82 Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa 82 83 83 3.2. Synthetic Polymers Synthetic polymers are defined as structures obtained in the laboratory with the purpose of improving the final properties of the material in which they are introduced [ 84 72 85 86 72 Mačák et al. [ 87 87 88 To summarize this chapter, we can conclude that natural polymers excel in biocompatibility and inherent bio-functionality but are less stable, while synthetic polymers offer superior mechanical strength, scalability, and release control. Blended systems often achieve the best compromise. 4. Hybrid AgNPs–Polymer Systems In the following sections, we examine each category of AgNPs–polymer systems, namely hydrogels, membranes, scaffolds, 3D/4D printed structures, and coatings or sprays by discussing their formulation and functional characteristics. For each system, we focus on key aspects, including the mode of nanoparticle incorporation (in situ versus ex situ), strategies for crosslinking and network formation, mechanisms governing stability and controlled silver release, and surface functionalization approaches, as it is described in Figure 5 4.1. Hydrogels Many studies favor in situ AgNPs synthesis, where silver ions are reduced directly within the hydrogel matrix during gelation, resulting in uniform dispersion and stable integration. For instance, the work presented in [ 89 90 Hydrogel architecture is heavily influenced by crosslinking chemistry, which determines porosity, mechanical strength, and swelling, which are all key to drug and silver release profiles. For example, the hydrogel proposed in the study of Qiu et al. [ 89 89 90 + + 91 To enhance biological interactions and nanoparticle stability, hydrogels are often chemically modified. PEGylation provides anti-fouling properties, while peptide conjugation encourages cell adhesion. Green hydrogels, like those proposed by Aldakheel et al. [ 90 90 4.2. Membranes and Films Membranes and films in AgNPs–polymer systems are widely used in antimicrobial coatings, filtration, wound care, and packaging. To achieve in situ incorporation, silver ions are loaded into the polymer precursor and reduced chemically/thermally, generating AgNPs within the matrix. These yield well-dispersed, narrowly sized nanoparticles owing to templating effects and stabilized growth [ 92 93 94 Table 2 The structural design of nanoparticle-loaded polymer membranes is critically influenced by the crosslinking strategy employed. Physical crosslinking techniques, such as freeze–thaw cycling or ionic gelation, are particularly effective for hydrophilic, water-soluble matrices like PVA or alginate. These methods avoid the use of chemical agents and are frequently utilized in systems where biocompatibility and minimal processing are desired, as demonstrated in alginate–AgNPs composite films [ 95 96 A more versatile approach involves the development of interpenetrating polymer networks, where two or more polymer networks coexist in a physically entangled but chemically independent structure. This configuration enables fine-tuning of nanoparticle immobilization and membrane permeability, providing a customizable platform for controlled AgNPs distribution. An example includes PVA/polyacrylic acid/graphene oxide–Ag composite membranes, which exploit the synergistic properties of the constituent polymers to improve both mechanical strength and nanoparticle stability [ 97 The overall crosslink density and network architecture are critical design parameters, directly impacting membrane porosity, mechanical behavior, and the release kinetics of embedded nanoparticles. Ensuring the colloidal stability of AgNPs within a membrane matrix is essential for sustained antimicrobial performance. This is often achieved through in situ reduction techniques, where silver ions are reduced directly within the polymer structure in the presence of stabilizing agents. Coatings with materials such as PEG or polydopamine are commonly applied to further enhance dispersion stability and prevent nanoparticle aggregation. Additionally, control over pore size and membrane architecture plays a central role in regulating Ag + 98 In more advanced systems, stimuli-responsive release mechanisms have been implemented. Here, polymers sensitive to environmental triggers, such as pH or temperature, modulate the release of Ag + 98 The effective immobilization of AgNPs on membrane surfaces is often facilitated by chemical surface modification. The introduction of functional groups such as hydroxyl (–OH), carboxyl (–COOH), and amine (–NH 2 99 100 4.3. Scaffolds Three-dimensional scaffolds are formed from natural or synthetic polymers and offer structural support, enhance cell migration, and serve as reservoirs for bioactive agents. Incorporation of AgNPs into these platforms promotes antimicrobial activity but demands precise control over synthesis, stability, and release dynamics. In situ incorporation involves generating AgNPs within the scaffold during fabrication, ensuring uniform dispersion and minimizing nanoparticle aggregation. The study presented in [ 101 Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus 101 Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus mutans 102 103 4 103 103 Another route for incorporating AgNPs is ex situ incorporation. This procedure entails embedding pre-synthesized and stabilized AgNPs into pre-formed scaffolds, offering enhanced control over nanoparticle characteristics. Citrate-capped AgNPs on collagen-coated PCL nanofibers is an example of such scaffolds. Collagen-coated PCL mats were functionalized with pre-synthesized silver nanoparticles (~20 nm), resulting in a composite that exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterococcus 104 The physical properties of AgNPs-loaded scaffolds, particularly their mechanical strength, porosity, and nanoparticle retention efficiency, are highly dependent on the crosslinking strategies employed during fabrication. One effective approach involves polydopamine-induced crosslinking, which has shown notable results in scaffolds composed of PLGA/PCL. In these systems, polydopamine serves a dual function: it facilitates the attachment of AgNPs to the polymer surface while simultaneously promoting crosslinking within collagen networks from the organ. This dual action leads to enhanced mechanical integrity and improved cellular compatibility, making the scaffolds more suitable for tissue engineering applications [ 102 A second method combines photopolymerization with in situ nanoparticle synthesis, where UV exposure not only initiates the formation of AgNPs within the collagen matrix but also increases the crosslink density of the scaffold. This simultaneous process reinforces the structural stability of the material and slows its degradation rate, contributing to prolonged functionality in biological environments [ 101 Additionally, scaffolds based on polymer–mineral composites present a promising avenue for achieving multifunctional properties. For example, integrating PCL with bioactive calcium phosphate matrices results in a mechanically robust scaffold with osteoconductive characteristics. The inclusion of AgNPs, whether incorporated during synthesis or added post-fabrication, further enhances the system by introducing antimicrobial functionality alongside bone-regenerative capacity, demonstrating the potential for synergistic therapeutic performance [ 105 The controlled release of silver ions is a critical design parameter in AgNPs-based scaffolds, as it governs the balance between rapid antimicrobial action and long-term therapeutic efficacy. Achieving this balance requires tuning both the material composition and the release mechanisms inherent to the scaffold architecture. One common release pattern is the burst–plateau profile, as observed in plasma-activated PCL scaffolds. These materials exhibit a sharp initial release of Ag + 103 In another approach, enzymatic degradation-driven release plays a central role in collagen-based systems. When AgNPs are generated in situ within the collagen matrix, the resulting scaffold demonstrates enhanced resistance to enzymatic breakdown. This property not only prolongs structural integrity, but also enables a more gradual and sustained release of silver ions over time, aligning with the slower progression of biofilm formation and chronic infection risks [ 101 Lastly, diffusion-regulated ion release can be achieved by manipulating the scaffold’s internal architecture and composition. Materials incorporating tailored porosity or bioactive fillers, such as hydroxyapatite or graphene oxide, exhibit more controlled Ag + 105 Surface modification of polymer scaffolds plays an important role in optimizing nanoparticle binding, ensuring uniform dispersion, and enhancing cell–material interactions. These modifications not only improve the physicochemical compatibility between the polymer and AgNPs but also contribute to the scaffold’s biological performance. Plasma activation is one such technique, commonly applied to PCL fibers to introduce reactive functional groups: primarily hydroxyl (–OH) and carboxyl (–COOH) onto the scaffold surface. These groups serve as effective anchoring points for the formation or immobilization of AgNPs, improving their stability and distribution across the matrix [ 103 102 The addition of collagen coating further enhances the biological interface. As a natural extracellular matrix component, collagen offers excellent biocompatibility and provides specific binding sites for nanoparticle attachment. This dual functionality supports both tissue regeneration and antibacterial activity, making it particularly advantageous in wound healing or bone tissue engineering contexts [ 104 105 4.4. 3D/4D Printed Structures Four-dimensional printing with AgNPs composites faces challenges including maintaining nanoparticle dispersion, avoiding release of spikes during processing, ensuring repeatable actuation, and relying on standardized fatigue/release testing protocols. The emergence of 3D and 4D printing technologies has significantly advanced fabrication strategies for polymer-based AgNPs systems, enabling precise spatial control over scaffold architecture and functionalization. These technologies allow precise control over architecture, mechanical properties, and localized AgNPs distribution, thus expanding applications in wound healing, bone regeneration, and smart biomedical devices. Four-dimensional printing is an advanced form of 3D printing in which the printed object is designed to change its shape, properties, or function over time in response to external stimuli such as temperature, moisture, pH, light, and magnetic or electric fields. In in situ approaches, silver precursors (e.g., AgNO 3 101 In contrast, ex situ strategies deposit pre-synthesized AgNPs onto the surface of printed scaffolds. This is often achieved by surface modification with adhesive layers such as polydopamine, enabling the immobilization of AgNPs and enhancing antimicrobial coverage across scaffold surfaces [ 106 Thermoplastic polymers such as PCL and PLGA acid maintain structural integrity post-printing due to their intrinsic melting–solidification behavior. In one study, AgNPs embedded in 3D-printed PLGA scaffolds resulted in robust architectures with antibacterial activity and mechanical stability suitable for bone tissue applications [ 107 2+ 108 AgNPs release from printed constructs depends on the matrix degradation rate, nanoparticle–polymer interaction, and environmental pH. For instance, PCL-based scaffolds allow for slow degradation over 3–6 weeks, facilitating sustained AgNPs and Ag + 109 110 Surface functionalization enhances the antifouling and antibacterial performance of printed scaffolds. Polydopamine coatings serve as reductive, bioadhesive intermediaries for AgNPs immobilization, significantly reducing microbial adhesion and biofilm formation [ 106 Functionalized 3D-printed scaffolds have achieved significant decreases in Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli 111 4.5. Coatings and Sprays Silver nanoparticle coatings and sprayable formulations are other variants which provide versatile, scalable, and surface-specific strategies for endowing substrates with antimicrobial and bioactive functions. These systems are ideal for post-fabrication functionalization of biomedical devices, textiles, consumer products, and packaging materials, offering flexibility in application and sustained efficacy. Ex situ incorporation involves embedding pre-synthesized AgNPs into a polymeric or solvent-based matrix which is subsequently applied to surfaces via spraying, dip-coating, spin-coating, or brush-painting. For instance, AgNPs dispersed in PVA were successfully spray-coated onto textiles, producing durable antibacterial fabrics that retained >99.9% activity even after multiple laundering cycles [ 112 In contrast, in situ generation entails applying silver salts to the target surface followed by chemical or photochemical reduction to form AgNPs directly on-site. Surfaces functionalized with dopamine or other reductive groups can catalyze silver ion reduction while anchoring nanoparticles tightly, increasing durability, and minimizing leaching [ 113 Polymer-based networks have emerged as essential platforms for enhancing the stability and functionality of AgNPs-containing coatings. Both natural and synthetic polymers, such as chitosan, PVA, gelatin, and polyurethanes, provide a matrix that immobilizes silver nanoparticles while simultaneously improving wear resistance and mechanical durability [ 114 115 Maintaining the stability of sprayable AgNPs formulations is essential to ensure a balance between antimicrobial efficacy and cytocompatibility. An uncontrolled burst release of Ag + One widely employed approach involves polymer entrapment, wherein AgNPs are embedded within hydrophilic matrices such as hydrogels or PVA films. These systems provide a hydrated environment that acts as a diffusion barrier, moderating ion release over time [ 116 117 Another effective stabilization method is core–shell encapsulation, in which AgNPs are coated with protective shells such as silica or PEG. These coatings enhance oxidative stability and prolong the functional lifespan of the nanoparticles under biological conditions by mitigating premature ion leaching [ 118 In addition to passive stabilization, stimuli-responsive release systems have emerged as promising tools for controlled delivery. For example, pH-sensitive or thermoresponsive formulations can exploit the acidic microenvironment of infected or wounded tissues to trigger localized Ag + 119 Achieving durable adhesion of AgNPs-based coatings to diverse substrate materials remains a critical challenge, particularly in biomedical and high-stress applications. To address this, various surface functionalization techniques have been developed to improve the interfacial compatibility between AgNPs and underlying substrates. One widely employed approach is plasma treatment, which is especially effective for low-surface-energy polymers such as PE. Exposure to plasma generates reactive functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carboxyl) on the polymer surface, thereby increasing surface energy and enhancing the interaction with AgNPs or their carrier matrices [ 120 113 For inorganic substrates, such as glass or ceramics, silane coupling agents are commonly employed. These bifunctional molecules form covalent bonds with hydroxylated surfaces on one end, while the other end can interact with AgNPs-containing coatings through chemical or physical means. This technique provides a strong and stable interface, particularly useful in environments requiring long-term mechanical integrity [ 121 These surface modification strategies are particularly crucial in applications subjected to mechanical stress or moisture exposure, including surgical instruments, implantable devices, and wound-contact materials, where reliable coating adhesion is essential for sustained antimicrobial function and device performance. 5. Applications for Polymeric Systems Containing AgNPs 5.1. Biomedical Applications 5.1.1. Antibacterial Wound Dressings Wound dressing is one of the main applications of polymers matrices, keeping in mind the biomedical purpose. Wound dressings are essential in wound treatment, especially if the area of the affected organ is large. Skin, the largest organ in the human body, can be altered due to various factors and stimuli. Furthermore, skin is permanently involved in metabolic changes from our body, so is it critical to ensure stability and normal physiological functions all the time [ 122 123 Nowadays, several types of wound dressing are available, designed to offer temporary support, to protect the infected wound, and to assure a prevention of microbial infection. The polymeric basis of the wound dressing is the perfect matrix for healing, while regeneration or antibacterial effect is assured by the drugs/nanoparticles incorporated. Various wound dressing types have been fabricated lately. Some examples are hydrocolloid dressings, hydrogels, foam dressings, films, and membranes [ 124 Figure 6 125 Several studies have been reported for wound dressing based on AgNPs–polymer composite. Sethuram et al. [ 126 Figure 7 126 Another example is the cellulose–HA/AgNPs injectable hydrogel developed by Long et al. which achieved 100% closure of burn wounds in mice within 14 days, demonstrating both rapid healing and infection control [ 127 90 128 128 5.1.2. Drug Delivery and Controlled Release Systems Polymer matrices-based drug delivery systems have emerged as novel tools in controlled and sustained therapeutic agent release, particularly for localized applications. When integrated with AgNPs, these systems offer not only physical support for drug loading and transport, but also inherent antimicrobial properties, making them highly effective against resistant pathogens. The synergy between AgNPs and encapsulated drugs enhances therapeutic efficacy while potentially reducing the required dosage and limiting side effects [ 129 Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus 130 Additionally, PVA/AgNPs hydrogels have been engineered for wound infection management, releasing both silver ions and encapsulated antimicrobial drugs under physiological conditions. One such study utilized PVA-AgNPs hydrogels loaded with curcumin, where AgNPs enhanced the antibacterial range, and curcumin provided anti-inflammatory effects, supporting both disinfection and tissue regeneration [ 131 Moreover, stimuli-responsive hydrogels, particularly pH or temperature-sensitive systems can be designed to release drugs preferentially at infection sites where acidic pH or elevated temperatures are common due to inflammation. A recent work demonstrated the use of thermoresponsive hydrogel–AgNPs composites for transdermal drug delivery. The system remained stable at room temperature but released both AgNPs and the encapsulated antibiotic upon reaching skin temperature (37 °C), enhancing treatment efficiency while minimizing systemic exposure [ 132 In situ-forming injectable hydrogels with AgNPs also offer promising drug delivery strategies for internal infections. These systems can be applied in minimally invasive procedures and solidify at the target site, forming a localized reservoir that releases both the AgNPs and therapeutic agents over time, which is ideal for applications like periodontal disease, osteomyelitis, or infected implants [ 133 Despite their advantages, the release kinetics of AgNPs and drugs must be carefully controlled to avoid cytotoxicity and ensure biocompatibility. Surface modification of AgNPs, polymer blending, and crosslinking density adjustments are common strategies to fine-tune these properties [ 134 5.1.3. Tissue Regeneration and Scaffolding Tissue engineering, an important field of nanotechnology, has the aim to create innovative materials for disrupted human body functions. In tissue engineering, the materials should possess high biocompatibility and should simulate in high percentage the extracellular matrix of the implanted area. Considering these properties, the possibility of implant or scaffold rejection is minimal, while the healing is assured by the cells from the surrounding tissues. Scaffolds can be fabricated for soft tissue engineering or hard tissue engineering, if bone restauration is needed. Classical synthesis methods are well known in the literature; however, the hot topic of tissue engineering remains, at the moment, the bioprinting approach. The advent of 3D and 4D printing technologies has opened new frontiers in designing AgNPs-loaded polymeric systems with unprecedented spatial precision and dynamic functionality. Three-dimensional printing allows for layer-by-layer fabrication of complex architectures, enabling precise distribution of silver nanoparticles within defined regions of the structure. This approach supports patient-specific implants, smart wound dressings, and compartmentalized drug release systems [ 56 135 Together, these polymeric platforms and fabrication techniques provide a flexible toolbox for addressing the multifaceted challenges of antimicrobial delivery and material performance in both clinical and commercial environments. Their integration with AgNPs continues to push the boundaries of smart, multifunctional materials for next-generation biomedical devices and food safety systems. The versatility of 3D/4D-printed AgNPs–polymer systems enable a broad spectrum of biomedical applications, which are summarized in Table 3 Four-dimensional printing, though still emerging in the AgNPs–polymer domain, offers transformative potential. Shape-memory and stimuli-responsive hydrogels (responsive to pH, temperature, or moisture) have been developed for smart wound dressings and implants that can adapt in vivo conditions [ 136 5.2. Food Packaging Applications This chapter delves into the implementation of AgNPs–polymer platforms in food packaging, highlighting their roles in antimicrobial protection, shelf-life extension, and emerging active/biosensing functionalities. Figure 8 5.2.1. Antimicrobial Packaging Films AgNPs-integrated packaging films are engineered to actively inhibit microbial proliferation at the food–package interface. Their antimicrobial functionality is primarily mediated through two synergistic mechanisms: the sustained release of silver ions and direct interactions between nanoparticles and microbial cells. These mechanisms result in potent antibacterial and antifungal effects, while the inclusion of AgNPs also contributes to improved mechanical robustness and enhanced barrier properties, particularly against water vapor and gas transmission [ 137 A range of biodegradable and food-safe polymers serve as matrices for AgNPs incorporation. Materials such as cellulose derivatives, chitosan, starch, alginate, pectin, and PVA are commonly employed due to their film-forming ability and environmental compatibility. Two principal strategies are used to incorporate AgNPs into these matrices. The in situ synthesis approach involves the introduction of silver salts directly into the polymer solution before casting. During the drying phase, or under mild heating, reduction reactions take place, generating nanoparticles that are uniformly distributed throughout the film. This method offers strong matrix integration and reduced aggregation. Alternatively, ex situ methods rely on pre-synthesized AgNPs, which are either mixed into the polymer blend or applied to film surfaces post-casting. This approach enables precise control over nanoparticle size and morphology, although achieving homogenous dispersion can present challenges. Both incorporation methods have demonstrated notable antimicrobial efficacy. For example, carboxymethylcellulose-based films containing AgNPs have shown strong inhibitory effects against Escherichia coli 3 138 Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus 139 Beyond microbial inhibition, AgNPs also enhance the physical characteristics of packaging films. Their inclusion reduces water vapor permeability and oxygen transmission rates by filling microvoids in the polymer matrix and increasing film density, both of which are critical for the preservation of moisture-sensitive food products. Mechanical strength and thermal stability are also improved, as demonstrated in glutaraldehyde-crosslinked PVA/sodium caseinate films containing AgNPs, which exhibited increased tensile strength and reduced swelling behavior [ 140 137 141 5.2.2. Shelf-Life Extension Through AgNP–Polymer Packaging Polymer films embedded with AgNPs have emerged as a versatile platform for extending the shelf life of a wide array of food products. Their multifunctional character, encompassing antimicrobial activity, antioxidant potential, and improved barrier properties, makes them highly effective in mitigating spoilage, preserving organoleptic quality, and retaining the nutritional integrity of packaged foods. By addressing multiple degradation pathways simultaneously, AgNPs-based packaging provides a strategic advantage over conventional materials in food preservation. The mechanisms underpinning the shelf-life extension offered by AgNPs–polymer composites are multifaceted; however, they are similar to the previously presented mechanisms of AgNPs. A primary factor is microbial suppression, achieved through the gradual release of AgNPs and Ag + + 142 143 The efficacy of AgNPs-based packaging has been demonstrated across a variety of food matrices. For instance, in long-term storage studies involving shelled nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios, and walnuts, films containing 1–3 wt% AgNPs significantly reduced microbial and mold growth over a 24-month period. In particular, pistachios packaged with high AgNPs-loading films exhibited a notable increase in shelf life, from approximately 13 months to 20 months, while also preventing aflatoxin formation. Importantly, these preservative effects were achieved without compromising sensory quality [ 144 In high-moisture, lipid-rich food systems such as oil cakes, PE films doped with 3–5 wt% AgNPs and TiO 2 145 2 146 147 AgNPs-based packaging materials have demonstrated considerable potential in extending shelf life and enhancing food safety; however, their widespread implementation remains constrained by several critical challenges. Among these are regulatory concerns related to silver migration and overall nanoparticle content. To ensure consumer safety, packaging systems must be engineered to limit the release of Ag + 5.2.3. Active Packaging and Biosensing Systems In recent years, the development of AgNPs–polymer films have progressed beyond passive food protection, moving toward multifunctional systems capable of actively monitoring food freshness. These advanced packaging materials not only inhibit microbial growth, but also incorporate biosensing functionalities, often based on colorimetric or gas-responsive mechanisms, that signal spoilage in real time. Such smart systems enable freshness assessment visually or electronically without the need to breach the packaging, offering practical benefits across the supply chain. One prevalent sensing strategy involves the detection of spoilage gases, particularly hydrogen sulfide, which serves as a reliable marker of meat degradation. A notable example is a gellan gum–AgNPs bionanocomposite that detects hydrogen sulfide released during meat spoilage. The interaction between AgNPs and hydrogen sulfide induces the formation of Ag 2 148 Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus 149 6. Challenges and Limitations The challenges regarding AgNPs, presented schematically in Figure 9 6.1. AgNPs Toxicity and Safety A number of key toxicological concerns have been identified in relation to AgNPs, particularly regarding their interactions with human biological systems. The significant antimicrobial activity of AgNPs derives largely from Ag + 150 151 151 151 The antibacterial effect of AgNPs is a promising strategy for micro-organisms’ inhibition; however, many in vitro and in vivo studies revealed the possible toxicological behavior of AgNPs on cells and bacteria. These types of experiments involve the exposure of AgNPs to cultures or organs in different doses, thus evaluating the final reactions. Interactions are mainly guided by the concentrations and doses of AgNPs; therefore, a dose-dependent is analyzed using cytotoxic assays [ 150 152 150 The influence of AgNPs can appear at very early stages of development as it is also proved in a recent research paper presented by Il Kim et al. [ 153 153 154 154 155 156 157 157 2 2 157 158 158 Compared to in vitro studies, the AgNPs toxicity in humans is much less studied in the scientific community, especially due to the ethical considerations. However, existing in vivo studies on animals exposed various pathways for AgNPs, such as inhalation, ingestion, or direct application on the skin [ 150 Occupational exposure limits have been established. For instance, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends a respirable 8 h Time-Weighted Average (TWA) of 0.9 µg/m 3 159 151 In addition to the concern for acute exposure, the potential for chronic exposure effects, bioaccumulation, and long-term safety concerns are crucial aspects of responsible nanomaterial design. The literature indicates a significant knowledge gap in this area, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive view of nanotoxicity [ 160 Chronic, low-concentration exposure is a primary concern. Unlike acute effects, which may be immediate and dramatic, the subtle, long-term impact of continuous exposure to AgNPs is still not fully understood. Studies have shown that even low concentrations of certain heavy metals can affect biological systems and immune responses without obvious clinical manifestations, suggesting that chronic exposure might have adverse effects on overall health [ 161 162 163 Furthermore, we must address the lack of standardized toxicity testing protocols for AgNPs–polymer composites, which is a major hurdle in evaluating long-term safety [ 164 165 165 165 6.2. Regulatory Barriers The regulatory landscape presents formidable challenges for AgNPs–polymer systems, especially regarding their use in food contact materials. While AgNPs offer significant antimicrobial advantages, their nanoscale complexity triggers strict regulatory scrutiny, which varies considerably across jurisdictions. In the European Union, Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004 requires that any substance used in food contact materials must be demonstrated not to compromise human health or alter food in unacceptable ways. This extends to nanomaterials—even those derived from previously approved bulk substances. Under Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011, materials are evaluated individually, and silver in nanoform is not currently listed in Annex I, meaning nanosilver is not authorized for general use in the EU without undergoing a formal approval procedure [ 166 167 w w 166 168 In the United States, AgNPs-based materials are regulated via the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process or through GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) determinations. As of yet, no AgNPs packaging material has received federal approval. Regarding the biomaterials, these evaluations must address both chronic and sub-chronic exposures, as well as genotoxic potential, to meet the stringent standards set by regulatory bodies. Even so, applicants must demonstrate rigorous nanotoxicological and migration testing. Because of their biocidal function, AgNPs products may also fall under Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) regulation, especially where antimicrobial claims are involved [ 169 Globally, the regulatory environment is fragmented. Canada lacks explicit nanoparticle migration thresholds, Brazil excludes AgNPs from approved plastic additives, and several countries, such as India, China, and Australia, either lack dedicated nanomaterial provisions or apply non-uniform guidance [ 170 171 Table 4 6.3. Recommendations for Standardizing Characterization and Testing The key to resolving these inconsistencies lies in a multi-faceted approach, beginning with the standardization of characterization methods to ensure the fundamental properties of the nanoparticles are consistently measured [ 13 Finally, the standardization of release kinetics evaluation is critical for both scientific and regulatory purposes [ 172 + + 173 6.4. Long-Term Stability and Release Control Ensuring long-term stability and controlled release of AgNPs in polymer systems is essential for the safe and effective application of AgNPs–polymer biomaterials. Extension of shelf life, microbial protection, and compliance with safety regulations all depend on how these materials behave over time under realistic conditions. Long-term integrity of AgNPs within polymer matrices is influenced by physicochemical interactions, environmental factors, and film composition. Nanoparticles’ migration and ion release can occur through mechanisms such as surface desorption, oxidation, polymer degradation, or mechanical wear [ 174 + 175 2 2 2 176 69 The release behavior and long-term stability of AgNPs within polymer-based systems are critically influenced by the design of the polymer matrix, the choice of surface stabilizers, and the processing conditions employed during fabrication. Surface functionalization plays a key role in modulating nanoparticle stability. Stabilizing agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, thiolated PEG, and protective coatings, ranging from silica and gold to lipid membranes, have been shown to significantly enhance resistance to oxidative degradation, dissolution, and leaching. These modifications contribute to prolonging the functional lifespan of AgNPs in active systems [ 69 + 69 To conclude this subsection, the most effective approaches in achieving long-term stability and release control are steric/electrostatic stabilization [ 177 178 179 6.5. Environmental Concerns and Recyclability The incorporation of AgNPs in polymer matrices introduces environmental complexities, ranging from lifecycle-level resource burdens to end-of-life ecosystem impacts and recyclability hurdles. Careful design and responsible deployment are essential to reconcile antimicrobial benefits with ecological sustainability. Life cycle assessments consistently identify AgNPs synthesis, including silver extraction and nanoparticle fabrication, as the dominant contributor to the environmental burden, often exceeding downstream impacts by an order of magnitude. Reference [ 180 180 6.5.1. Ecotoxicity and Recycling Challenges in Wastewater and Biosolids Regarding the food packaging applications, AgNPs showed some concern on their ecotoxicity. Once AgNPs-enhanced packaging is used and disposed of in wastewater streams, AgNPs can enter treatment systems. Pilot studies in real wastewater treatment plants demonstrate that most AgNPs rapidly sulfidize (forming Ag 2 181 AgNPs–polymer materials often take the form of multilayer films or coated composites, complicating mechanical recycling due to mixed-material incompatibility and nanoparticle contamination. Less than 5% of such packaging is successfully recycled in practice, with the rest directed to incineration or landfills. This results in resource loss and potential environmental release of silver at disposal sites. In biodegradable polymers, AgNPs can impair compostability: recent studies reveal that AgCl-embedded nanocomposites reduce soil microbial respiration and retard biodegradation, potentially disrupting soil ecology [ 182 At end-of-life, AgNPs embedded in polymer matrices undergo transformation processes depending on pH, redox state, and co-occurring ions. The most common pathways are oxidation to soluble Ag + 2 183 184 185 6.5.2. Mitigation Strategies and Sustainable Design The need to reduce the possible harmful effects of AgNPs without compromising their antibacterial functionality has gained researchers’ attention lately. A key avenue involves rethinking how silver nanoparticles are synthesized in the first place. Green synthesis, the biological synthesis of AgNPs, is a promising strategy since, in the reaction, natural and biocompatible compounds are introduced. This approach can eliminate other possible chemical regents, but also dramatically lowers the overall energy demand of the nanoparticle production process [ 186 6.5.3. Environmental Impact Across the Entire Life Cycle The environmental impact is not limited to the end-of-life but extends across the entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) provides a holistic framework for comparing these impacts to conventional alternatives [ 187 Environmental burdens begin with the extraction of silver. Traditional mining is energy-intensive and has significant environmental ramifications, including habitat destruction and toxic emissions. However, a more sustainable alternative is the recovery of silver from electronic waste (e-waste), which aligns with the principles of a circular economy and reduces reliance on virgin mineral extraction [ 188 187 189 189 During the use phase, AgNPs can be released into the environment, particularly from products like textiles during washing [ 189 2 190 189 A comparative analysis reveals a complex trade-off between AgNPs and conventional antimicrobials. For example, an LCA comparing nanosilver T-shirts to those treated with triclosan found that the production phase of nanosilver products can have a higher climate footprint. However, the potent antimicrobial efficacy of AgNPs can potentially lead to a reduced need for washing, which could offset the production-phase impact during the use phase [ 189 191 7. Future Perspectives and Opportunities The next generation of AgNPs–polymer systems is being driven by several converging innovations, as they are described in Figure 10 7.1. Integration with Other Nanomaterials When comparing different antimicrobial nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles are widely recognized for their potent, broad-spectrum efficacy, often showing higher activity at lower concentrations than other metal nanoparticles like copper and zinc oxide. However, all three types of nanoparticles have demonstrated strong antimicrobial effects against various pathogens [ 192 The strategic integration of AgNPs with nanocellulose and graphene-based materials represents a powerful multidisciplinary convergence. High-aspect-ratio cellulose nanofibrils or nanocrystals can serve as reinforcing matrices that anchor and stabilize AgNPs while improving mechanical strength and barrier performance. For example, sulphidized cellulose nanofiber coatings embedded with AgNPs applied to paper substrates create dense, uniform films that significantly reduce water vapor permeation, enhance tensile properties, and provide strong bactericidal action against Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus 193 Hydrogels composed of nanocellulose and alginate, with in situ-synthesized AgNPs, have shown excellent antimicrobial efficacy, biodegradability, and controlled decomposition in both biomedical and food industries. In food packaging, the study reported by Somsesta et al. showed a decomposition of such system within 15–30 days in soil, making them well-suited to sustainable active packaging, even for poultry products, with shelf-life extension while meeting biocompatibility thresholds (e.g., ≤15 mg total volatile basic nitrogen; 99.99% bacterial inhibition) [ 194 7.2. Smart Packaging with IoT and Biosensing Integration Recent trends in packaging technology emphasize not only passive protection but also active monitoring of food quality throughout the supply chain. This dynamic focus aligns particularly well with AgNPs–polymer systems, which can serve as both antimicrobial agents and integral components of smart sensing platforms. 7.2.1. Colorimetric Sensor Arrays Leveraging the LSPR of AgNPs, colorimetric sensor arrays offer a visually intuitive freshness indication. A recent study utilized agar-embedded AgNPs arrays to detect volatile organic compounds, such as amines and hydrogen sulfide, released during meat spoilage. The system exhibited distinct colorimetric changes in response to 12 key spoilage compounds, offering both qualitative and quantitative freshness assessments without complex instrumentation [ 195 7.2.2. IoT-Enabled RFID/NFC Smart Tags Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near-Field Communication (NFC) tags embedded in packaging films present a transformative route for real-time food monitoring. For instance, innovative research demonstrated the use of ammonia-sensitive layers (based on AgNPs-graphene or conductive polymers) integrated into chipless RFID resonators, allowing visual and wireless detection of spoilage gases. These tags can report temperature, humidity, or gas milestones detectable by smartphones or scanners, enhancing traceability while maintaining package integrity [ 196 197 Regarding the challenges, scalability and cost pose significant barriers, with large-scale production of flexible electronics and nanocomposite films depending on affordable conductive inks, such as silver flakes dispersed in polyurethane, and roll-to-roll manufacturing processes [ 197 7.3. Emerging Bioinks and Advanced 4D Printing The evolution of bioinks toward multifunctional and stimuli-responsive behavior has opened new frontiers in advanced fabrication. Incorporating AgNPs within hydrogels or polymer matrices enhances not only antimicrobial performance, but also printing fidelity, mechanical resilience, and responsiveness to environmental cues. A comprehensive review by Chakraborty et al. [ 198 198 Smart hydrogel matrices, capable of morphing shape in response to temperature or hydration, can entrap AgNPs to offer programmable release profiles and dynamic structural behavior. For instance, temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based gels embedded with nanoparticles undergo coil-to-globule transitions, tightly confining particles above the transition temperature and sharply reducing diffusion. This allows on-demand AgNPs release or mechanical actuation [ 199 Crafting AgNPs-based bioinks for 4D printing involves balancing multiple factors: maintaining nanoparticle stability and dispersion, tuning rheological properties for reliable extrusion, and programming responsiveness (e.g., thermal, pH). Achieving simultaneous cell compatibility, mechanical strength and print fidelity remains nontrivial, especially for biomedical or biodegradable packaging applications. Beyond silver, other nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide or carbon quantum dots, enhance bioink performance. Graphene oxide inclusion improves viscosity, electrical conductivity, barrier function, and UV stability, enabling robust extrusion and printing precision while supporting cell viability [ 200 7.4. Cost Optimization, Scalability, and Commercialization Prospects The journey from laboratory-scale development of AgNPs–polymer composites to full-scale commercialization is complex, requiring convergence across material science, industrial processing, economics, and regulatory compliance. While considerable progress has been made in optimizing functionality and safety at the research level, scaling these systems up while maintaining performance, sustainability, and affordability is an ongoing challenge. Continuous flow systems have emerged as a promising alternative to batch synthesis for producing AgNPs with narrow size distributions and consistent surface characteristics, crucial for integration into polymer matrices [ 201 202 203 The high cost of silver is a critical factor limiting the widespread commercialization of AgNPs-based materials. Therefore, much of the current focus is on reducing AgNPs loading while maintaining or even enhancing antimicrobial efficacy. Studies have shown that silver contents as low as 0.1–0.3 wt% can achieve sufficient antimicrobial protection when synergistically combined with other functional agents like curcumin, essential oils, or plant extracts [ 204 205 Economic models suggest that antimicrobial films with silver contents below 20 mg/m 2 206 Consumer perception is another key driver of success. While nanotechnology can be viewed with skepticism, studies show that clear labeling, demonstrable benefits, and sustainability claims can increase acceptance [ 166 AgNPs are often viewed as costly, but at application-relevant loadings their cost impact can be modest relative to performance gains, provided release is controlled. As of 21 August 2025, the silver spot price is ~USD 1230–1240 per kg (≈USD 38/oz) [ 207 208 207 209 2 2 210 211 212 213 Scalability must also account for end-of-life management. AgNPs–polymer systems should be designed with recyclability or biodegradability in mind, ideally using mono-material substrates and avoiding toxic crosslinkers or irreversible chemical bonding. Compostable polymers, combined with biosynthesized AgNPs, have shown promise for achieving both performance and environmental compliance [ 214 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Both authors made equal contributions in conceptualization, methodology, and writing—review and editing.
