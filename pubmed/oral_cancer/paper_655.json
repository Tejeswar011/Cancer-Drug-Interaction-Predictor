Aim: We aimed to rigorously and systematically delineate the trends, themes, and scope of the top 100 papers aided by bibliometrics to map the field of palliative care science and identify future directions for the field. Design: We conducted a bibliometric analysis in accordance with the BIBLIO checklist for reporting the bibliometric reviews. Data source: Employing a comprehensive search string we examined the Scopus online database from inception to December 14th, 2024, to identify and retrieve pertinent publications. Extracted data included year of publication, number of citations and other metrics, authorship, and study design, among others. Results: Total citations for the 100 most cited articles ranged from 5083 to 419. Most articles originated from the US (43%), United Kingdom (16%), and Canada (15%). Overall, 83 different first authors and 87 senior authors contributed; about half first authors and 32% of senior authors were women. Forty-two different journals published the articles. Key themes were end-of-life care, palliative care integration within different medical sub-specialties (e.g. oncology, respiratory disease), clinical tool development and validation, and symptom management. Conclusion: Our findings provide a comprehensive map of the palliative care scientific landscape with key implications for future research, clinical practice, and policy. These results can be used to mitigate scientific disparities in author representation, ensure appropriate evidence use across international contexts, and empower high-quality evidence-based palliative care advocacy.

Therefore, in this study, we systematically evaluated the predominant research themes within palliative care scientific production. To prioritize a health equity lens, we focused analysis and discussion on country, author, and gender representation to assess whether relevant gaps (e.g. gender imbalances) explored in other fields,  34 Material and methods Search strategy and database selection The methodology used in this study follows the approaches previously described in other bibliometric studies  35 Supplemental Material, Supplemental Table 1  36 www.scopus.com Supplemental Material S1 Search string Data retrieval and charting We exported literature data as a Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) worksheet. Duplicate publications were removed using EndNote X9 (Clarivate Analytics). The remaining search results were organized by total citations number; articles were then ranked from the most cited to least, and subsequently initially screened for potential retrieval and inclusion at title and abstract levels by two independent investigators (A.B. and S.C.). Inclusion criteria were: (i) original research (i.e. either studies reporting original data or publications not presenting original data including—but not limited to—guidelines and expert consensus documents, narrative and/or systematic reviews, meta-analyses, commentaries, letters, and editorials) having either adult or pediatric patients as the study population; (ii) focused on patients, relatives, caregivers, and/or healthcare providers; (iii) within the field of palliative care. In instances of disagreement, a third senior investigator (J.D.U.) was consulted. Following this preliminary assessment, a further careful examination of full-text articles was performed by A.B. and S.C. to finalize the selection of the 100 most cited studies, by total number of citations, in the field of palliative care. Next, for each of the 100 identified articles, we used SciVal ( www.scival.com Data extraction The following pertinent information which fulfilled research requirements was systematically extracted from the retrieved studies: (i) year of publication; (ii) total number of citations; (iii) title; (iv) first author; (v) senior author (i.e. last author); (vi) study design; (vii) corresponding author’s country; (viii) gender of the first and senior (i.e. last) author; (ix) publishing journal; and (x) FWCI. The gender of first and senior author was determined by querying authors’ first names in the Genderize database (available at: https://genderize.io  37  38 Additionally, we calculated journal metrics (i.e. impact factor [IF] and quartile)—as sourced from the Journal Citation Reports™ 2023 (Clarivate Analytics)—alongside citation density (i.e. total number of citations divided by the number of years each work had been published)  39 Results Our search string yielded a total of 7238 documents in the Scopus database (from inception until December 14th, 2024). Following the download of search results, the data were exported into a Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) file, and duplicate records were removed. The remaining results were then systematically reorganized in descending order of total citation count. The first 100 most cited studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria (i)–(iii) were selected for inclusion and subsequent bibliometric analyses. The key features of the first 25 most cited studies are summarized in Table 1 Supplemental Material, Supplemental Table 2 Table 1. Top 25 most cited articles in palliative care.

Authorship and countries analysis Eighty-three different first authors contributed to the 100 most cited articles by total citation in palliative care. Among them, 12 authors (14%) had more than one publication, with one author credited with three publications and another author with five publications. Regarding senior authorship, a total of 87 senior authors were identified. Eight of them contributed to more than one publication, with Harlos M and Higginson IJ being the most prolific, with three articles each as last author. Overall, 47 papers (47%) were authored by a female first author, and female first authors accounted for almost half (44%) of the total number of first authors (37/83). Conversely, only one-third (34%) of the 100 most influential articles in palliative care were authored by a female senior author, with male senior authors accounting for the majority of senior authorship (68%, 59/87; Supplemental Material, Supplemental Figure 2 According to the corresponding author affiliation, the articles originated from 15 different countries.

Notably, we found significant disparities in terms of country representation—with high-income countries dominating the palliative care research landscape—as well as ongoing gender inequities. Our analysis builds on these findings to help bridge persistent gaps in authorship, gender representation, and geographical diversity, ultimately fostering a more equitable and inclusive global discourse. As such, more than a decade since the World Health Assembly passed resolution 67.19 that identified palliative care as a core component of comprehensive healthcare and universal health coverage,  3  41 What this study adds? The great citation impact of articles emphasizing the integration of early palliative care across nononcological, chronic diseases and focusing instead on the assessment of symptom and pain severity—critical elements in optimizing patient care and quality of life—underscores a shift in the palliative care field toward proactive models of care that are reflected in global efforts to improve quality of life and symptom control across different patient populations. Stemming from Temel’s foundational study, early palliative care integration has been increasingly explored as a model for nononcological chronic and life-limiting conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  42  43  44  44 While it is important to recognize that citation counts “per se” do not inherently validate the scientific merit of a publication, a high citation count may serve as a clear indicator of an article’s visibility and influence within the scientific community. 17 45 45 46  40  45 47 48 The New England Journal of Medicine n Journal of Clinical Oncology n New England Journal of Medicine  49 To gain an in-depth comprehension of the palliative care scientific output, it is crucial to consider the literature’s country of origin. In the global health context, about 95% of available medical evidence emerges from high-income countries which represent a mere 15% of the global population.  50 45 49 51 54 23 24 26  45  55  8  24 Prior analyses have shown that the inequities are not just in palliative care provision but also in the science that informs it. 20 22  56 9 57 The findings emerging from first author gender analysis align with previous evidence showing a growing representation of women in hospice and palliative care medicine. For instance, since 2014, women have constituted the majority of hospice and palliative care medicine fellowship graduates in the U.S., and 52% of program directors in 2019 were women.  58 38 59 60  38  59  60  58 Regarding key themes, although end-of-life care was the most frequent topic among the articles, it accounted for only 20% of the total. Other prominent themes included the integration of palliative care into the management of chronic and/or life-limiting diseases, the development and validation of clinical tools (e.g. scales and questionnaires), the psychological aspects of chronic and/or life-limiting illnesses, alongside symptom, and pain management. Altogether, these topics accounted for 48% of the 100 most cited articles, underscoring the wide scope of palliative care which extends beyond the sole end-of-life contexts. This finding also indirectly reflects the multifaceted role of palliative care in addressing psychological, physical, and spiritual needs across both early and late stages of chronic and/or life-limiting conditions.  25  61 62 63 The findings of this analysis can do much to empower palliative care experts and allies with information regarding the most rigorous science to inform evidence-based advocacy efforts. Evidence-based advocacy is essential to improve practice, decrease disparities, and promote investments in palliative care capacity building, stigma reduction, and essential medicine access. 64 66 Strengths and limitations of the study While this bibliometric analysis of the 100 most cited articles in palliative care provides valuable insights into the scientific landscape of the field and encompasses among its strengths adherence to the BIBLIO checklist and dual-investigator screening, it is important to acknowledge several of its inherent limitations. Bibliometric analyses cannot replace systematic reviews or meta-analyses, which are designed to yield conclusive evidence for clinical decision-making in evidence-based medicine.  25 Conclusions and future perspectives In our bibliometric analysis of the 100 most cited articles in palliative care we found that the majority of the scientific output originated from the US, with a strong underrepresentation of LMICs—where the access to palliative care may play an even more important role. There are clear implications to ensure LMIC partnership and leadership in palliative care research endeavors. Additionally, while the gender gap in palliative care research appears to be less apparent compared to that observed in other medical fields (e.g. critical care medicine, neuro-oncology and urology), our findings emphasized the need for further targeted investigation aimed at achieving a more comprehensive characterization and understanding of the issue while amplifying the scientific contributions of women in the field. Overall, these findings provide a comprehensive map of the palliative care scientific landscape presenting key implications for future research, clinical practice (e.g. fostering early palliative care integration), and policy (e.g. by raising awareness on the existing gaps in palliative care access between high-income countries and LMICs). These results can be used to mitigate scientific disparities in author and country representation, ensure appropriate evidence use across international contexts, and empower high-quality evidence-based palliative care advocacy.
