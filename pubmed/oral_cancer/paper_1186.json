This study aimed to quantify the global burden of fibrosis-related diseases using updated global burden of disease (GBD) 2021 data across 204 countries and territories and establish a cost-effective diagnostic approach targeting vestigial-like family member 3 (VGLL3), a fibrosis-associated transcriptional co-regulator. Our analysis revealed that from 1990 to 2021, fibrosis-related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality increased by 16.71% and 4.83%, respectively, with neoplasms and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being the main contributors. We also found a growing burden disproportionately concentrated in low socio-demographic index (SDI) regions. To address the diagnostic gap, we developed a novel immunoassay targeting VGLL3, an intrinsically disordered transcriptional co-regulator implicated in early fibrotic remodeling. The assay demonstrated a detection range of 27.01–2512.36 nM and a limit of detection of 12.55 nM. Immunohistochemical validation in a mouse myocardial infarction model confirmed the antibody’s specificity in fibrotic tissues. This work highlights widening global health disparities in fibrosis burden and introduces a cost-effective, scalable diagnostic strategy for early fibrosis detection, particularly suitable for resource-limited settings. fibrosis global burden of disease (GBD) vestigial-like family member 3 (VGLL3) early diagnosis health disparities protein biomarkers intrinsically disordered proteins resource-limited settings Scientific Research Program of the Education Department of Shaanxi Province 23JK0359 Project for Talent Initiation of Shaanxi University of Technology SLGRCQD035 Qinba Biological Resources and Ecological Environment Provincial-Ministry Joint State Key Laboratory (Cultivation) “City-University Co-construction” Research Special Project SXZC-2301 This work was supported by the Scientific Research Program of the Education Department of Shaanxi Province (23JK0359), the Project for Talent Initiation of Shaanxi University of Technology (SLGRCQD035) and Qinba Biological Resources and Ecological Environment Provincial-Ministry Joint State Key Laboratory (Cultivation) “City-University Co-construction” Research Special Project (SXZC-2301).

Introduction Fibrosis is a progressive pathological process characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) [ 1 2 3 Understanding global fibrosis epidemiology is essential for guiding prevention and intervention strategies. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provides a unique platform for tracking disease burden over time and across regions [ 4 Despite its clinical importance, the timely detection of fibrosis remains a significant challenge. Conventional methods of detecting fibrosis include cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and histopathology [ 5 6 Studies have shown that VGLL3 can respond to changes in matrix stiffness, bind to TEAD, directly mediate fibroblast collagen production, play a key role in liver fibrosis, and its mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in fibrotic liver tissue of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( GSE126848 6 6 7 8 To bridge the gap between global fibrosis surveillance and practical diagnostics, we employed a two-pronged approach. First, we performed a comprehensive analysis of global fibrosis burden using GBD 2021 data, with a focus on temporal trends, major disease drivers, and inequality patterns. Second, we developed a VGLL3-targeted diagnostic platform based on avian antibodies, a cost-effective and scalable alternative to mammalian IgG with superior stability and specificity [ 9 10 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Global Burden Analysis Based on GBD 2021 To evaluate the global burden and disparities associated with fibrosis-related diseases, we extracted data from the GBD 2021 database available through the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation website ( http://ghdx.healthdata.org/ p 2.1.1. Inequality Analysis To quantify socioeconomic disparities in fibrosis-related disease burden, we conducted a two-part health inequality assessment based on SDI. Countries were ranked by SDI scores and assigned percentile ranks. The slope index of inequality was calculated by regressing DALYs rates against SDI ranks, using the population-weighted midpoint of the cumulative SDI distribution. Robust linear regression was used to control for outliers and heterogeneity. The concentration index of inequality was calculated by comparing the cumulative proportion of DALYs with the cumulative population distribution ordered by SDI, using numerical integration of the Lorenz curve area. 2.1.2. Frontier Analysis To evaluate whether countries’ fibrosis-related DALYs rates aligned with their level of development, we performed a frontier efficiency analysis. A non-parametric locally weighted regression was used to estimate the empirical frontier relationship between age-standardized rate (ASR) of DALYs and SDI scores from 1990 to 2021. This frontier represents the theoretical minimum ASR of DALYs achievable at a given SDI level. The vertical gap between each country’s actual DALYs rate and the frontier was calculated as a proxy for performance deviation, with countries close to the frontier considered to have maximized their potential in reducing fibrosis burden relative to their socioeconomic development. 2.2. VGLL3 Antigen Design, Expression, and Purification VGLL3 sequence data were downloaded from UniProt database accession number P85442 Table S1 E. coli HST08 Among these constructs, the VGLL3 (1–237) fragment demonstrated good expression in E. coli E. coli BL21 (DE3) 2.3. Chicken Immunization, Avian Antibody Preparation, and Antibody Validation VGLL3-specific polyclonal avian antibody was generated by immunizing 20-week-old laying hens with the purified VGLL3 (1–237) antigen. The initial dose of 250 µg was emulsified in Freund’s complete adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and administered via intramuscular injection. Three booster immunizations (200 µg each) were given at two-week intervals using Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. Eggs were collected and stored at 4 °C. Laying hens were kept in a chicken house at (20 ± 2) °C and relative humidity (60 ± 5%), with 3 hens per cage. They were given complete feed and sufficient drinking water, and the light was on for 16 h per day. During immunization, they were gently restrained. If the hens showed pain-related behaviors such as depression and reduced food intake, an appropriate amount of butorphanol was injected intramuscularly in time for analgesia. Avian antibodies were extracted from egg yolks using polyethylene glycol precipitation [ 11 2.4. Antibody Binding Analysis by ic-ELISA Optimal conditions for ic-ELISA were established using checkerboard titration [ 12 2 4 2.5. Myocardial Infarction Model and Immunohistochemistry To validate the antibody’s performance in tissue, a mouse model of myocardial infarction was established in 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (Shanghai Fuyan Biotechnology Co., Shanghai, China). Mice were anesthetized and ventilated via oral intubation. A left thoracotomy was performed to expose the heart, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated with 4–0 silk sutures to induce ischemia, confirmed by myocardial blanching. After closure and recovery, mice were monitored for four weeks. All animal procedures were approved by Shanghai Fuyan Biotechnology Corporation (Shanghai, China) and conformed to national animal welfare regulations. At endpoint, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and heart tissues were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched, and sections were blocked with 5% BSA. Primary anti-VGLL3 avian antibody (1:1000) was applied overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with a biotin-labeled anti-chicken secondary antibody (1:2000). Signal was developed using DAB substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were dehydrated and mounted for microscopic analysis (Nikon Eclipse Ci-L, Tokyo, Japan). 2.6. VGLL3 Detection in Human Plasma Samples Plasma samples were obtained from two female patients with clinically confirmed liver cirrhosis admitted to Hanzhong Central Hospital. Blood was collected in EDTA-anticoagulant tubes and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to separate plasma. 25–35 μL of each plasma sample was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Blocking, antibody incubation, and color development conditions were the same as those for Western blot in Section 2.3 3. Results 3.1. Temporal Trends in the Proportion of Global Fibrosis-Related DALYs Between 1990 and 2021, the global burden of fibrosis-related diseases exhibited a steadily increasing trend in both DALYs and mortality rates. The proportion of DALYs attributable to fibrosis-related conditions rose from 14.78% to 17.25%, reflecting a relative increase of approximately 16.71%. Similarly, the mortality rate increased from 26.78% to 28.08%, representing a 4.83% rise. Among various pathogenic factors, neoplasms consistently accounted for the largest share, with their contribution to DALYs rising from 6.57% in 1990 to 8.80% in 2021, and to mortality from 12.55% to 14.57%. COPD remained the second leading cause throughout the period, with its DALY share increasing from 2.20% to 2.77%, and a slight rise in mortality from 5.41% to 5.48% ( Figure 1 Although chronic kidney disease represented a smaller proportion of the total burden, it exhibited the most rapid relative growth, with its DALYs and mortality rates increasing by 92.47% and 87.75%, respectively. In contrast, tuberculosis was the only major cause of disease burden to experience a significant decline, with its mortality rate falling by 214.55% compared to 1990. For cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, the proportion of DALYs increased modestly from 1.40% to 1.61%, while mortality declined from 2.22% to 2.10%. Hypertensive heart disease remained a minor contributor to fibrosis-associated burden in 2021, accounting for 0.88% of DALYs and 1.96% of deaths globally ( Figure 1 3.2. Regional Disparities and Temporal Trends in Fibrosis-Related Burden Attributable to Neoplasms and COPD Marked regional disparities were observed in the fibrosis-related burden of neoplasms and COPD, the two leading contributors to global fibrosis-associated disability. In 2021, the ASR of neoplasm DALYs was highest in Europe, especially in Central Europe, with 3945.02 cases per 100,000 population (95% UI: 3668.14, 4199.24), followed by southern sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia ( Figure 2 Table S2 Figure 2 Table S3 Figure 2 Between 1990 and 2021, the global ASR of neoplasm-related DALYs declined by 25.59%. High-middle SDI countries reported the highest DALYs rates in 2021 (3388.27 per 100,000) despite a reduction in age-standardized death rate to 134.01 per 100,000 ( Table 1 For COPD, global disease burden also declined from 1990 to 2021. Total COPD-related deaths dropped by 37.12% (from 71.92 per 100,000 population to 45.22 deaths), and the ASR of DALYs decreased by 36.98% (from 1492.64 to 940.66 per 100,000) ( Table 1 Table 1 Table S3 3.3. Inequality Analysis Reveals Persistent Socioeconomic and Regional Disparities in Fibrosis-Related Burden Inequality analysis revealed persistent and distinct disparities in fibrosis-related disease burden across socioeconomic levels, particularly for neoplasms and COPD. For neoplasms, the slope index of inequality decreased markedly from 1507.98 (95% UI: 1153.77–1862.19) in 1990 to 328.00 (18.73–637.28) in 2021 ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 To further elucidate the relationship between socioeconomic development and fibrosis-related disease burden, we conducted frontier analysis. Overall, ASR of DALYs for both neoplasms and COPD declined across most high-, high-middle-, and middle-SDI countries between 1990 and 2021 ( Figure 3 Figure 3 3.4. Development and Validation of a VGLL3-Targeted Avian Antibody for Fibrosis Detection Considering the crucial role of VGLL3 in fibrosis, we posited that it could serve as a potential target for diagnosis and therapy. Initial attempts to express full-length VGLL3 in vitro resulted in extremely low expression levels, even with solubility-enhancing strategies such as SUMO tag fusion, and insufficient for subsequent experiments ( Figure S1A,B Figure 4 Figure S1D 6 Figure S1A,B Figure 4 Figure S1C Subsequently, using this truncated antigen, hens were immunized to generate a VGLL3-specific avian antibody. SDS-PAGE of the purified avian antibody revealed distinct bands corresponding to the heavy and light chains (−66 and −23 kDa, respectively) ( Figure 4 Figure 4 An ic-ELISA was developed and optimized with a coating antigen concentration of 10 µg/mL and an avian antibody dilution of 1:1600 ( Figure S2 Figure 4 2 50 To evaluate the antibody’s tissue specificity, immunohistochemical staining was performed on myocardial tissue sections from sham and myocardial infarction mouse models. In the sham group, myocardial fibers appeared well-organized with uniformly stained nuclei and negligible background, indicative of preserved tissue architecture ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 p Furthermore, to preliminarily assess the detectability of VGLL3 in body fluid samples, we attempted to detect VGLL3 protein expression in the plasma of patients with cirrhosis by Western blot. However, under current experimental conditions, we failed to obtain a clear positive signal ( Figure S4B 4. Discussion Fibrosis is not a disease, but the result of tissue injury characterized by ECM deposition and irreversible organ remodeling. It is a pathological endpoint shared by diverse chronic diseases and is implicated in approximately 45% of deaths in industrialized nations [ 3 Figure 5 Based on GBD 2021 data, our analysis presents a comprehensive global landscape of fibrosis-related DALYs and mortality across 204 countries from 1990 to 2021. During this period, the global burden of fibrotic diseases showed a steady upward trend, with DALYs increasing by 16.71% and mortality by 4.83% ( Figure 1 13 14 Further stratified regional analysis showed that the disease burden of neoplasms and COPD showed significant geographical heterogeneity. Neoplasm-related DALYs remained disproportionately high in high-SDI countries, whereas COPD burden was concentrated in East and South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and low-SDI regions ( Figure 2 Inequality metrics further underscore the divergence in global fibrosis dynamics. The slope index of inequality and concentration index of inequality for neoplasms decreased substantially, indicating narrowing absolute and relative disparities and a transition toward a more balanced global distribution ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Furthermore, frontier analysis, comparing country-specific DALYs rates with the minimum achievable burden at a given SDI level, identified several under-resourced countries such as Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Guinea as outperforming expectations, closely aligning with the global optimal frontier ( Figure 3 Against this backdrop, a novel, sensitive, and context-appropriate diagnostic strategy is critically needed to complement current imaging and serum-based fibrosis assessments, which suffer from specificity limitations, technical dependence, or invasiveness [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 miR-29b 6 Structural modeling using AlphaFold2 revealed that the VGLL3 protein contains numerous IDRs ( Figure 4 E. coli Figure S1A,B E. coli Figure S1D To develop a sensitive detection platform, we produced VGLL3-specific avian antibodies in hens. Compared to mammalian IgG, avian antibodies offer unique advantages: lack of cross-reactivity with human Fc receptors, reduced background binding, and enhanced recognition of mammalian antigens due to phylogenetic divergence [ 16 Figure 4 Figure 4 25 26 27 Importantly, immunohistochemistry on myocardial infarction mouse models demonstrated that the anti-VGLL3 avian antibody selectively stains fibrotic tissues, with significantly stronger signals in myocardial infarction hearts compared to controls ( p Figure 4 Figure S3 In addition, the upstream regulatory role of VGLL3 in the development of fibrosis makes it a promising early diagnostic biomarker that can complement rather than replace existing markers. Multiplex detection strategies combining complement 3 (Pro-C3), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and type VI collagen can improve the temporal and spatial resolution of fibrosis progression. Compared with traditional single markers, VGLL3 can reflect earlier molecular changes, capturing abnormal protein expression prior to imaging findings, thereby improving sensitivity and reducing the risk of false negatives. Notably, VGLL3 is consistently expressed across multiple organs, potentially identifying systemic fibrosis [ 6 Beyond fibrosis, VGLL3 is also widely expressed in various tissues and implicated in multiple disease processes, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. VGLL3 is overexpressed in cancer cells, such as those from breast tumors and osteosarcomas [ 22 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 While the VGLL3-based early fibrosis detection platform constructed in this study has achieved preliminary validation in a mouse model of myocardial infarction, it still has limitations. Tissue-level validation is currently limited to the heart and does not yet encompass common fibrotic organs such as the liver, lungs, and kidneys, limiting its cross-organ applicability. Western blot analysis did not detect VGLL3 protein signals in the plasma of patients with cirrhosis ( Figure S4B In summary, our study integrates global epidemiological insights with biomolecular innovation to address the critical diagnostic challenges of fibrosis. We not only identify VGLL3 as a mechanistically meaningful and diagnostically relevant target but also establish a novel avian antibody-based immunoassay platform with broad translational potential. This work paves the way for future multidimensional fibrosis diagnostics and opens new avenues for the detection of disordered proteins in human disease. 5. Conclusions This study provides an integrated global analysis of fibrosis-related disease burden using GBD 2021 data, revealing contrasting trends between neoplasms and COPD. While disparities in neoplasm-related DALYs have narrowed over time, the burden of COPD has become increasingly concentrated in low-SDI regions, underscoring persistent global health inequalities. Frontier efficiency analysis further identifies some low-SDI countries achieving near-optimal burden reduction despite limited resources. Importantly, we developed and validated a novel immunoassay based on avian antibodies, targeting the IDRs-containing protein VGLL3, a key upstream regulator of collagen synthesis. This represents the first successful application of avian antibodies for detecting IDRs proteins, offering enhanced specificity and early diagnostic potential for fibrosis. By integrating global epidemiological insights with an innovative diagnostic strategy, our work provides new tools and perspectives for advancing equitable and effective fibrosis detection and control.
