While long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of CSC stemness, their specific roles in gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) remain poorly understood. This study investigates the functional significance of lncRNA TSPEAR-AS2 in modulating GCSC properties and uncovers its underlying molecular mechanisms. Through integrated whole-transcriptome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and validation in 48 paired gastric cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, TSPEAR-AS2 was identified as a differentially expressed lncRNA upregulated in both GCSCs and tumor samples. Functional experiments revealed that TSPEAR-AS2 overexpression significantly enhanced GCSC sphere-forming ability, proliferation, cell cycle progression, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and expression of stemness markers (CD54, CD44, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2) while suppressing apoptosis. Conversely, TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown attenuated these malignant phenotypes. In vivo tumorigenicity assays in nude mice further confirmed that TSPEAR-AS2 promotes tumor growth, with overexpression accelerating and knockdown inhibiting tumor formation. Mechanistically, bioinformatics predictions and dual-luciferase reporter assays established TSPEAR-AS2 as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that sponges miR-15a-5p, thereby derepressing the miR-15a-5p target gene CCND1. Rescue experiments demonstrated that overexpression of miR-15a-5p phenocopied TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown, reducing GCSC stemness, while miR-15a-5p inhibition rescued the effects of TSPEAR-AS2 suppression. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel TSPEAR-AS2/miR-15a-5p/CCND1 regulatory axis that sustains GCSC stemness and tumorigenicity. These results highlight TSPEAR-AS2 as a potential therapeutic target for eradicating gastric cancer stem cells and improving clinical outcomes. gastric cancer gastric cancer stem cells LncRNA ceRNA stemness Interdisciplinary Programs of Chinese Medicine and Aging Science of the Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine 2025YLFWYGL020 This research was funded by the Interdisciplinary Programs of Chinese Medicine and Aging Science of the Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (No. 2025YLFWYGL020). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant threat to human health and impedes socioeconomic development [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subgroup of tumor cells [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are RNA molecules with transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small RNAs approximately 22 nucleotides in length that play a variety of important regulatory roles within the cell [ 30 31 29 30 31 32 33 In this study, we screened LncRNAs closely associated with GCSCs based on whole-transcriptome sequencing using bioinformatics methods and validated them in GC tissues and GCSCs. We then investigated the effect of these LncRNAs on the stemness-related functions of GCSCs using a range of molecular biology techniques. We further explored the downstream miRNA targets of LncRNAs to elucidate their mechanism of action. These data may provide targets for the prevention and effective treatment of GC, offer new insights and directions for advancing etiological research, and provide a theoretical basis for the potential clinical application of relevant GCSCs. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patients and Tissue Samples Tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue samples from 48 pairs of GC patients were obtained from Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, with approval from the Ethics Committee. All subjects signed informed consent forms. The tissues were collected following surgical excision from individuals who had not undergone prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The samples were stored at −80 °C. Inclusion criteria were 1. patients diagnosed with GC; 2. patients who had not received radiotherapy or chemotherapy before surgery; and 3. patients in good overall health and eligible for surgery. Exclusion criteria were 1. patients with concurrent tumors or other diseases of the digestive system; 2. patients deemed unsuitable for radical GC surgery prior to the operation; and 3. patients who died in the perioperative period due to surgical complications. This study’s flowchart is presented in Figure 1 2.2. Cell Culture The GC cell line HGC-27 (RRID: CVCL 1279) was purchased from Saiku Biological Company (Guangzhou, China) and authenticated using STR profiling. Cell resuscitation and culture were performed by adding 8 mL of RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution and 10% fetal bovine serum to a sterile Petri dish. The thawed cells were then added to the Petri dish and placed in a cell incubator with 5% carbon dioxide and saturated humidity at 37 °C for culturing. We changed the culture medium daily. Based on the cell growth situation, we passaged the cells every 2–3 days. Cell passage involved the old culture medium being discarded from the culture dish, and the cells were washed three times with PBS solution. We added 1 mL of trypsin digestion solution, observed under an inverted microscope after digestion at room temperature for about 2 min. When the cells became round, shrank, and started to detach, we immediately added an appropriate amount of RPMI-1640 complete medium to the culture dish to terminate the digestion. After the cells were completely detached from the dish wall, we transferred the digestion mixture containing the cells to a 15 mL sterile centrifuge tube and centrifuged them at 800 rpm for 5 min. We discarded the supernatant, resuspended the cells in RPMI-1640 complete medium, and evenly distributed them into two new culture dishes, each containing 8 mL of RPMI-1640 complete medium. Sorted GCSCs were cultured in serum-free DMEM/F12 complete medium supplemented with growth factors, including B-27 (2%), N-2 (1%), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20 ng/mL), and basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF, 20 ng/mL). All cells were cultured in an incubator with 5% CO 2 2.3. Isolation of CD54 + + − − The tumor tissues of GC patients and HGC-27 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were separately prepared into single-cell suspensions. According to the cell count and the instructions for the flow cytometry antibodies, corresponding volumes of CD44-FITC and CD54-PE antibodies (5 μL of CD44-FITC and 5 μL of CD54-PE antibodies for 1 × 10 6 + + − − 2.4. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) Analysis Total RNA was extracted from GC tissues and cells using RNA-easy reagent (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to detect the purity and concentration of the total RNA. cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit (GeneStar, Beijing, China). The qPCR reaction was prepared in a 10 μL mixture containing 1 μL of diluted cDNA, 5 μL of 2 × AceQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), 4 μL of DEPC water, and 0.2 μL each of forward (FP) and reverse primers (RP). The reaction was performed on a StepOnePlus PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) with the following cycling conditions: initial pre-denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Relative transcript expression was calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt Supplementary Table S1 2.5. Construction and Transfection The TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown and overexpression lentiviruses used in this experiment were generated by Genechem (Shanghai, China). The miR-15a-5p mimic and inhibitor constructs were developed by Hanbio Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). We adjusted the density of the GCSCs to 3 × 10 5 2 2.6. Western Blotting Assay Protein samples were extracted from GCSCs and tumor tissue using a RIPA lysis buffer (EpiZyme Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). First, we prepared gel in a glass plate according to the instructions of the gel preparation kit (EpiZyme Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). We placed the glass plate in an electrophoresis tank and added the electrophoresis buffer. The protein samples and protein marker were loaded into the loading wells. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 100 V. The PVDF membrane was activated with methanol. The components were placed in the transfer cassette in the following order: sponge, filter paper, gel, PVDF membrane, filter paper, and sponge. The transfer was conducted at a constant voltage of 100 V under ice bath conditions. After the transfer was complete, the PVDF membrane was placed in an incubation box and washed three times with TBST. The blocking solution was added, and the incubation box was placed on a shaker for 1 h of blocking at room temperature. The primary antibody incubation solution was added and incubated overnight in a chromatography cabinet at 4 °C. The secondary antibody solution was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The developer was pre-cooled by turning it on. The washed PVDF membrane was blotted dry with dust-free filter paper and then immersed in the luminescent solution. A chemiluminescence image analysis system was used to take pictures, analyze the results, and save the data. 2.7. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) The tumor tissues of nude mice fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were paraffin-embedded. The paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into slices approximately 4 μm thick using a microtome. The slices were placed in an oven at 60 °C for 2 h and then successively immersed in xylene, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 85% ethanol, 80% ethanol, and distilled water for dewaxing. The slices were immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide for about 10 min. After washing, the slices were steamed in water containing citrate buffer until boiling, cooled, and steamed again. After cooling, the slices were washed with PBS, blotted dry, and immediately blocked with an appropriate amount of serum at 37 °C. After blocking, the primary antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The corresponding secondary antibody was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. SABC was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min; then, the chromogenic agent was added. After color development, the slices were rinsed with water and blotted dry, and the chromogenic agent was added again for counterstaining. After counterstaining, the slices were rinsed with water and successively immersed in 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% ethanol and xylene. A drop of neutral balsam was placed on the glass slide; then, a coverslip was placed on it, and the slide was placed in a fume hood. After air-drying, the samples were observed under an inverted microscope. 2.8. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay The vector digestion system was prepared according to the kit instructions. The sample was gently pipetted until mixed well and then placed in a water bath at 37 °C for 1–2 h. After the digestion reaction was complete, agarose gel electrophoresis was performed, and the target fragment was recovered. The target gene sequence was synthesized directly onto the vector, and the target fragment was amplified. The target fragment was then connected to the vector. It reacted at 50 °C for 30 min and was then placed on ice for 5 min. We took 50 μL of DH5α competent cells and added 5 μL of the ligation product, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Heat shock was performed at 42 °C for 90 s, and then the sample was immediately placed in an ice bath for 3 min. In the laminar flow cabinet, we added 500 μL of LB medium without antibiotics. The tube was inverted 5 times and shake-cultured at 37 °C and 230 rpm for 60 min. The bacterial solution was spread evenly onto the solid plate with the corresponding antibiotic resistance and placed in an incubator at 37 °C for inverted culture for 12 h. PCR identification was performed on the bacterial solution. The positive clones were identified, and the sequencing results were compared. We extracted and purified the plasmid according to the kit instructions. The target plasmid was transfected into 293T cells, and detection was conducted according to the instructions of the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit. 2.9. RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) Assay Magnetic racks and magnetic beads were prepared. We added 5 μg of the target antibody and IgG and incubated them for 1 h. Following transfection with miR-15a-5p mimic or miR-15a-5p inhibitor, cells were collected into a 1.5 mL EP tube. RIP lysis buffer, protease inhibitor cocktail, and ribonuclease inhibitor were then added. After centrifugation, 100 μL of the supernatant was transferred to the magnetic bead–antibody complex and then incubated overnight at 4 °C. The magnetic bead–antibody complex was subsequently washed with RIP wash buffer. We then added 150 μL of proteinase K buffer and incubated the sample at 55 °C for 30 min. It was placed on a magnetic rack, and the supernatant was aspirated into a new 1.5 mL EP tube. RIP wash buffer, phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol were then added. After centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new EP tube. We added 50 μL of salt solution I, 15 μL of salt solution II, 5 μL of precipitation enhancer, and 850 μL of absolute ethanol, and the supernatant was centrifuged and discarded. The precipitate was air-dried naturally. The precipitate was resuspended in 20 μL of DEPC-treated water, and total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and RT-qPCR experiments were performed. 2.10. In Vivo Tumor Xenograft Model The BALB/c male nude mice used in this study were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. and housed at the Animal Experiment Center of Southeast University with approval from the Ethics Committee. Cell suspensions were injected into the axillae of nude mice (6 mice per group), and tumor growth was observed and measured periodically. Nude mice were euthanized approximately 4 weeks post-injection, and tumors were carefully excised and labeled. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula V = (a × b 2 2.11. Statistical Analysis Statistical methods were used to analyze differences in gene expression between different groups, namely, ANOVA and Student’s t p p 3. Results 3.1. LncRNA TSPEAR-AS2 Is Overexpressed in GCSCs GCSCs and non-GCSCs derived from GC tissues were sorted via flow cytometry and subjected to whole-transcriptome sequencing ( Figure 2 2 p 2 2 Figure 2 Transcriptome data from 375 GC tissues and 32 adjacent normal tissues were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, identifying 3634 differentially expressed LncRNAs using the criteria of p 2 Figure 2 A Venn diagram was used to identify intersections of differentially expressed LncRNAs from the TCGA database and whole-transcriptome sequencing, revealing 314 LncRNAs that were significantly different between GC tissues and adjacent normal tissues, as well as between GCSCs and non-GCSCs ( Figure 2 Among these intersecting LncRNAs, those with an average expression value of 0 in any group were excluded. The five most highly expressed and five least expressed LncRNAs were selected as candidates and validated in GC patient tissues. RT-qPCR showed no significant differences in ELFN1-AS1, FLG-AS1, LIN-CO0355, and FAM155A-IT1 expression between tumor and normal tissues ( p p Figure 3 Figure 2 3.2. LncRNA TSPEAR-AS2 Maintains the Stemness of GCSCs To investigate the role of TSPEAR-AS2 in GCSC stemness, we transfected GCSCs with TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown and overexpression lentiviruses ( Figure 4 Supplementary Figure S1A p Figure 4 p Supplementary Figure S1B In vitro sphere-forming assays showed that both the number and size of spheres were significantly reduced in the TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown group compared with the NC group ( Figure 4 Supplementary Figure S1C p Figure 4 p Figure 4 Supplementary Figure S1D,E p Figure 4 p Figure 4 p Supplementary Figure S1F,G p Figure 4 p Figure 4 p Figure 4 Supplementary Figure S1H–J 3.3. TSPEAR-AS2 Accelerated Cell Growth of GCSCs In Vivo To determine whether TSPEAR-AS2 regulates GCSCs in vivo, we performed subcutaneous tumor formation assays on nude mice. The results showed that nude mice injected with TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown cells developed significantly smaller tumors than the NC group ( Figure 5 Supplementary Figure S2A p p Figure 5 Supplementary Figure S2B We further performed immunohistochemistry to assess protein expression in the tumor tissues. TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown significantly reduced CD54, CD44, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 levels ( p Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 Supplementary Figure S2C–E 3.4. TSPEAR-AS2 Directly Targeted miR-15a-5p in GCSCs LncRNAs can regulate CSC functions by acting as molecular sponges for downstream miRNAs. To identify miRNAs targeted by TSPEAR-AS2, we first performed a nucleoplasmic isolation assay and determined that TSPEAR-AS2 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, suggesting its potential as a miRNA molecular sponge ( Figure 6 Figure 6 p Figure 6 p Figure 6 p Figure 6 We further examined the binding interactions between miR-15a-5p and TSPEAR-AS2 using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Sequence analysis identified miR-15a-5p binding sites within the TSPEAR-AS2 sequence ( Figure 6 p p Figure 6 Supplementary Table S2 3.5. miR-15a-5p Inhibited GCSC Stemness To investigate the function of miR-15a-5p, GCSCs were transfected with miR-15a-5p mimics or a miR-15a-5p inhibitor ( Figure 7 Supplementary Figure S3A Figure 7 Supplementary Figure S3B Figure 7 Supplementary S3C In addition, overexpression of miR-15a-5p inhibited GCSC proliferation ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 p Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 Supplementary Figure S3D–I 3.6. TSPEAR-AS2 Sponged miR-15a-5p to Regulate the Stemness of GCSCs Previous studies have shown that miR-15a-5p regulates GCSC stemness and shows an inverse expression pattern compared with TSPEAR-AS2. To explore their relationship, we conducted a rescue assay by co-transfecting TSPEAR-AS2 overexpression lentivirus and miR-15a-5p mimics into GCSCs. This included the NC group (oe-NC + mimics NC), the oe-TSPEAR-AS2 group (oe-TSPEAR-AS2 + mimics NC), the miR-15a-5p mimics group (oe-NC + miR-15a-5p mimics), and a co-transfection group (oe-TSPEAR-AS2 + miR-15a-5p mimics). The results showed that CD54, CD44, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 significantly decreased in the co-transfection group compared with the oe-TSPEAR-AS2 group ( p Figure 8 Figure 8 p Figure 8 We further tested whether the effects of TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown on GCSCs could also be reversed by miR-15a-5p. The experimental groups included the NC group (sh-NC + inhibitor NC), the sh-TSPEAR-AS2 group (sh-TSPEAR-AS2 + inhibitor NC), the miR-15a-5p inhibitor group (sh-NC + miR-15a-5p inhibitor), and the co-transfection group (sh-TSPEAR-AS2 + miR-15a-5p inhibitor). RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses showed that CD54, CD44, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 were higher in the co-transfection group than in the TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown group ( p Supplementary Figure S4A p Supplementary Figure S4B p Supplementary Figure S4C 3.7. CCND1 Is a Direct Target of miR-15a-5p The miRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan databases were used to predict miR-15a-5p-related target genes, ultimately identifying 240 target genes. By intersecting these with upregulated genes from whole-transcriptome sequencing, we obtained 39 miR-15a-5p-related target genes ( Figure 9 p Figure 9 p Figure 9 p p p Figure 9 Similarly, the rescue assay was performed using an interfering lentivirus, with the following groups: the NC group (sh-NC + inhibitor NC), the sh-TSPEAR-AS2 group (sh-TSPEAR-AS2 + inhibitor NC), the miR-15a-5p inhibitor group (sh-NC + miR-15a-5p inhibitor), and the co-transfection group (sh-TSPEAR-AS2 + miR-15a-5p inhibitor). The RT-qPCR results showed that CCND1 expression in the sh-TSPEAR-AS2 group was decreased compared with the NC group ( p p p p Figure 9 4. Discussion The prevalence of GC remains high, and the prognosis for advanced GC patients is poor, with limited treatment options that severely compromise quality of life [ 34 35 36 37 38 Previous studies have demonstrated that LncRNAs play a critical role in regulating CSCs. For example, LncRNA PVT1 enhances the sphere-forming ability of nasopharyngeal cancer CSCs [ 39 40 41 42 43 44 In this study, we established stable cell models with TSPEAR-AS2 knockdown and overexpression. After knocking down TSPEAR-AS2, the expression levels of CD54, CD44, Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 significantly decreased, while overexpressing TSPEAR-AS2 significantly upregulated the expression of these genes. This result demonstrated the effect of TSPEAR-AS2 on the stemness of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) at the gene expression level. Sphere-forming capacity is an important manifestation of the stemness characteristics of CSCs [ 45 46 CSCs possess the proliferative potential to regenerate and disseminate metastatic tumors. Alterations in the stemness-related functions of CSCs are often accompanied by corresponding changes in their proliferative capacity [ 46 47 Alterations in the cell cycle and apoptotic processes are critical for the abnormal biological behavior of cancer stem cells. Apoptosis is a mode of cell death that plays a crucial role in tumor formation, and LncRNA knockdown WDFY3-AS2 induces apoptosis in OC stem cells [ 48 49 The cell cycle is a fundamental process of life activities and is regulated by multiple factors. Regulating cell cycle progression has been suggested as a promising approach to controlling tumor growth. The cell cycle includes the G1, S, and G2 phases of DNA synthesis, followed by the M phase [ 50 EMT is a well-established mechanism underlying CSC biology [ 36 Emerging evidence indicates that the LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory pathway is a critical mechanism through which LncRNAs influence the function of CSCs. LncRNAs competitively bind to downstream miRNAs via the ceRNA mechanism, thereby modulating miRNA expression levels, which subsequently regulate cancer by influencing the expression of corresponding target genes. This regulatory mechanism has been widely observed in LncRNA-mediated control of CSCs. For example, LncRNA H19 promotes the proliferation and self-renewal of breast CSCs by sequestering miR-Let-7c and upregulating targets in the estrogen receptor 1 and Wnt signaling pathways. Both knockdown of LncRNA H19 and upregulation of miR-Let-7c impair the stemness-associated functions of breast CSCs [ 51 52 53 54 5. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated that TSPEAR-AS2 interacts with miR-15a-5p via a ceRNA mechanism, as predicted by bioinformatics analysis, and we validated this relationship using the rescue assay. In both in vitro and in vivo models, Shen et al. showed that miR-15a-5p regulates GCSC stemness by targeting ONECUT2 [ 55 Notably, CCND1, also known as Cyclin D1, is a cell cycle regulatory gene that we have previously studied, suggesting that TSPEAR-AS2 may influence the cell cycle and thus regulate GCSCs through the miR-15a-5p/CCND1 axis. In conclusion, our experiments verified that TSPEAR-AS2 regulates GCSC stem cell properties through the miR-15a-5p/CCND1 axis, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic biomarker for GC therapy.
