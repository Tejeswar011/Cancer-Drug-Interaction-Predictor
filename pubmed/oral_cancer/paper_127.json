The secondary objective was to compare the performance of ACE-MBCA with gadobenate dimeglumine. Materials and Methods: Three independent readers analyzed MRI examinations from a previously completed randomized crossover clinical trial in a blinded manner in a centralized setting. The study included 20 consecutive adult patients with known or suspected liver metastases, who received both ACE-MBCA and gadobenate dimeglumine. The readers evaluated 6 types of MRI scans (unenhanced, enhanced, and combined MRI for both contrast agents) with lesion visualization [lesion border delineation (LBD) and lesion contrast (LC)] as primary outcome. To maintain the blinded nature of the study, all statistical analyses were performed by an independent statistician who was not involved in the image reading process. Differences in primary outcomes were performed using 1-sided paired t Results: ACE-MBCA–enhanced MRI demonstrated statistically significant superior scoring over unenhanced MRI for visualizing focal liver lesions, with mean LBD scores improving from 1.8–2.3 to 2.4–2.9 and LC scores ranging from 1.8–2.3 to 2.8–3.3 across all 3 readers ( P Conclusions: Compared with unenhanced MRI, ACE-MBCA MRI resulted in superior visualization and a greater number of detected liver lesions. ACE-MBCA and gadobenate dimeglumine performed similarly in the visualization and detection of colorectal liver metastases.

Note: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; N, number of patients. Briefly, the original study prospectively and consecutively recruited 20 adult patients, including 10 men and 10 women aged 51–79 years. All of them had been referred to the multidisciplinary team for evaluation of known or suspected liver metastases, before partial liver resection. In the study, patients were randomized to receive either ACE-MBCA followed by gadobenate dimeglumine (n = 11) or gadobenate dimeglumine followed by ACE-MBCA (n = 9) in random order on the basis of sealed envelopes, with MRI scans performed before and after the administration of each contrast agent. Liver MRI was performed at 1.5 T via a combination of spine and flexible body array coils, with ACE-MBCA MRI conducted before and 3 hours after the oral administration of 1.6 g of MnCl 2 18 3 http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 21 Evaluations Three independent radiologists, with 15, 30 and 35 years of experience, who were blinded to the contrast agent, evaluated different types of assessments in sequential sessions with at least 1 week interval between assessments of the same patient to reduce recall bias. The evaluations included unenhanced MRI sequences acquired before contrast agent administration, contrast-enhanced MRI sequences obtained after oral ACE-MBCA and after IV gadobenate dimeglumine administration, and combined MRI evaluations where unenhanced and contrast-enhanced sequences were evaluated together, performed separately for ACE-MBCA and gadobenate dimeglumine, resulting in ACE-MBCA combined and gadobenate dimeglumine combined, respectively. The dynamic phase after the IV of gadobenate dimeglumine was not used in this analysis as was the case for the original data collection (Supplementary table 1, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 The primary outcome measured changes in lesion border delineation (LBD) and lesion contrast (LC) scores for up to 15 lesions per patient. 21 The lesion size was measured as the longest diameter of the smallest and largest lesions per patient. Confidence in lesion detection and localization was rated on a 3-point scale (low, moderate, high). Quantitative parameters were assessed by reader 4, measuring the mean percent signal intensity enhancement of liver (SI%), mean liver-to-lesion contrast (LLC), 22 SI% = ([SI liv liv liv LLC = (SI liv les liv les SNR = SI liv noise CNR = (SI liv les noise SI liv les noise les Overall image quality was rated as optimal, suboptimal, or not evaluable. Data Analysis To maintain the blinded nature of the study, all statistical analyses were performed by an independent statistician who was not involved in the image reading process, using SAS platform v9.4. The primary analysis evaluated the mean changes in lesion visualization (LBD and LC) for each patient between unenhanced MRI and ACE-MBCA combined MRI (Fig. 1 t http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 The secondary efficacy analyses included evaluating changes in visualization for ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI versus unenhanced MRI and ACE-MBCA combined MRI versus gadobenate dimeglumine combined MRI (Fig. 1 For comparative analyses, descriptive statistics, including arithmetic means, standard deviations, medians, ranges, and 95% confidence intervals, were generally provided. No formal hypothesis testing was performed for most secondary endpoints, but the 95% CIs were used to evaluate potential differences between categories. Ethics Approval The original study was conducted in accordance with its protocol, regulatory requirements, good clinical practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments in force at the time of study initiation. As this study involved only a retrospective analysis of existing MRI data, with no new patient involvement or data collection, it did not require separate ethics committee approval. The present analysis was within the scope of what participants had originally consented to during the initial study enrollment; therefore, no additional consent was needed.

P t As described in Table 2 P P 2 FIGURE 2 MR images (A–F) of a 63-year-old female patient with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Note: 3D volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination T1-weighted images before (A, D) and 3h after (B, E) the ingestion of chloride tetrahydrate with corresponding T2-weighted HASTE images (C, F) showing a 1.3 cm metastasis in segment 8 (open arrow in A–C) and a 3 cm metastasis in segment 7 (arrow in D–F). The three independent readers scored the lesion border delineation of the lesion in segment 8 2/3/4 for unenhanced, 3/3/3 for ACE-MBCA enhanced and 4/3/4 for ACE-MBCA combined MRI. Lesion border delineation of the lesion in segment 7 was scored 2/3/4 for unenhanced, 3/4/3 for ACE-MBCA enhanced and 4/4/4 for ACE-MBCA combined MRI. Corresponding values for lesion border delineation were 2/3/3, 3/4/4, and 4/4/4 for the lesion in segment 8, and 2/3/3, 3/4/3, and 4/4/4 for the lesion in segment 7. Only lesions that were detected and reported by at least one of the three independent readers during their blinded evaluation are marked on these images. As secondary result, for ACE-MBCA combined MRI versus gadobenate dimeglumine combined MRI, statistically significant differences were observed only for reader 1. No statistically significant differences were found for readers 2 and 3 in either LBD or LC, as described in Table 2 Lesion Detection All 3 readers detected significantly more lesions with both ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI and ACE-MBCA combined MRI than with unenhanced MRI (Supplementary Table 3, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 Lesion Size The results of the readers' measurements of lesion dimensions with both contrast agents are summarized in Supplementary Table 5, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 For smallest detected lesions, readers 2 and 3 measured smaller mean longest diameters with ACE-MBCA (enhanced and combined) MRIs than for unenhanced MRI but the differences were not statistically different (Supplementary Table 6, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 For lesions <1 cm, ACE-MBCA combined MRI improved detection compared with unenhanced MRI, while showing similar detection rates to gadobenate dimeglumine combined MRI. In the 1–3-cm range, both ACE-MBCA enhanced and combined MRIs maintained detection rates comparable to unenhanced MRI, with ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI showing slightly better performance (Supplementary Table 7, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 Confidence in Lesion Detection and Localization The results of the readers' confidence in lesion detection with the ACE-MBCA showed variation across the 3 readers. For readers 1 and 3, the mean confidence scores were higher for both ACE-MBCA enhanced and combined MRIs than for unenhanced MRI and reader 2 showed a marginally lower mean confidence score for ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI than for unenhanced MRI and combined MRIs. In the case of gadobenate dimeglumine combined MRI, the readers' mean confidence scores for lesion detection were consistent across all the readers (Supplementary Table 8, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 For lesion localization reader 1 and 3 reported greater confidence with both ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI and ACE-MBCA combined MRI than with unenhanced MRI, with statistically significant differences. Reader 2 showed slightly lower confidence with ACE-MBCA combined MRI compared with unenhanced MRI (nonsignificant) and similar confidence with ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI (Supplementary Table 10, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 Quantitative Parameters The quantitative assessments are described in Supplementary Table 12, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 For gadobenate dimeglumine enhanced MRI, the LLC showed a mean difference of −0.17 (95% CI −0.24 to −0.10), and the CNR showed a mean difference of −4.20 (95% CI −6.77 to −1.64), whereas for gadobenate dimeglumine enhanced MRI, the SNR showed a mean difference of 2.23 (95% CI −0.53 to 4.99) compared with unenhanced MRI (Supplementary Table 13, http://links.lww.com/RLI/B9 DISCUSSION In this blinded evaluation, ACE-MBCA enhanced MRI demonstrated statistically significant superior scoring over unenhanced MRI for visualizing focal liver lesions, with all 3 independent readers showing improved lesion LBD and LC. This superiority was consistently supported across multiple assessment parameters, including improved lesion detection, enhanced measurement capabilities, and increased reader confidence. This study confirmed the ability of the ACE-MBCA to detect significantly more lesions than unenhanced MRI does, particularly for small lesions. Importantly, ACE-MBCA demonstrated comparable performance to gadobenate dimeglumine across all evaluation criteria, including lesion visualization, detection rates, size measurements, and reader confidence scores, although the study was not designed to formally test for statistical equivalence or noninferiority. The confidence score assessments for ACE-MBCA showed that this investigational contrast agent is a promising alternative, especially considering its oral dosing 2–3 hours before MRI and potential safety advantages for renally impaired patients. The superior visualization of focal liver lesions achieved with ACE-MBCA combined MRI, demonstrated consistently across all 3 independent readers for both LBD and LC, has significant clinical implications for patient care. This enhanced visualization capability could enable more precise disease staging through better lesion detection, particularly for smaller lesions that might be missed on unenhanced MRI. The improved LBD could lead to more accurate surgical planning and better assessment of treatment response. Furthermore, the consistently superior lesion detection capability of ACE-MBCA, especially for small lesions, could facilitate earlier identification of liver metastases at a more treatable stage, or avoid futile liver resections in patients with widespread small metastases, making it particularly valuable for surveillance MRI in high-risk patients and monitoring treatment response. While 1 reader demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both LBD and LC with the ACE-MBCA compared with gadobenate dimeglumine in the hepatobiliary phase, the other 2 readers showed comparable performance between the agents in this phase, suggesting noninferior visualization capabilities. It is worth noting that gadobenate dimeglumine provides additional dynamic imaging phases (arterial, portal venous, and equilibrium) that were not available with ACE-MBCA, as the latter is an oral product that enters the liver via the portal vein. These improvements are especially significant for patients with renal impairment, who currently face limited MRI options owing to safety concerns for GBCA, potentially offering them access to high-quality contrast-enhanced MRI with a manganese-based alternative. The ability of ACE-MBCA to detect smaller lesions is also noteworthy. For lesions <1 cm, ACE-MBCA combined MRI improved detection compared with unenhanced MRI, while showing similar detection rates to gadobenate dimeglumine combined MRI. In patients with severely impaired renal function, iodine-based contrast agents are typically contraindicated due to the increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. While recent advances in CT technology have enabled examinations with reduced doses of iodine-based contrast agents, the clinical utility and safety profile of these lower-dose protocols in this vulnerable patient population remain inadequately characterized. 23 25 19 21 26 The initial study 21 19 20 This study presents several notable methodological strengths that increase the reliability of its findings, including the centralized blinded evaluation of MRI by 3 independent radiologists, which significantly reduced potential bias, and the comprehensive assessment of multiple imaging parameters, which provided a thorough evaluation of diagnostic performance. The use of separate independent readers, rather than a consensus read, reduced the impact of individual reader interpretation on the study conclusions, providing a more robust assessment of ACE-MBCA's visualization capabilities. The study's comparative design against both unenhanced MRI and gadobenate dimeglumine offered valuable insights into the relative performance of the ACE-MBCA compared with current clinical standards. However, several important limitations must be considered when interpreting these results: the small sample size of 20 patients limits statistical power and generalizability, and the retrospective nature of the analysis may introduce inherent biases such as observer bias—since readers are evaluating historical images with knowledge that these are from patients with confirmed liver metastases—or recall bias—as readers might still remember previous interpretations of images from the same patient across different sessions despite the between-read gaps. The open-label design of the study could have influenced the image acquisition process despite the blinded re-evaluation, and while this study compared ACE-MBCA to gadobenate dimeglumine, these results cannot be generalized to all gadolinium-based contrast agents, particularly since gadoxetic acid is now the preferred liver-specific GBCA in clinical practice but was not yet available when the primary study was designed. The interpretation of lesion size measurements should be approached with caution, as without pathological confirmation, it remains uncertain whether differences in lesion sizes between MRI methods represent true anatomical variations or measurement bias, as previous studies have shown that MRI measurements can both overestimate and underestimate actual lesion dimensions compared with pathological specimens. Additionally, diffusion-weighted imaging, which has become standard in abdominal protocols, was not available at the time of study planning. While this study was limited to adult patients with known liver metastases, future research should include long-term follow-up with direct clinical outcome measures to fully establish the utility of the ACE-MBCA in routine practice and define optimal type-specific diagnostic protocols for broader patient populations.
