Given the multifaceted nature of PCOS and the involvement of multiple disciplines, the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS vary among different specialties. Our study aimed to elicit preferences of physicians from multidisciplinary specialties for PCOS treatment and their perceptions of PCOS management to enhance the understanding of clinical practice in China. Methods A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted to elicit the physicians’ preferences of PCOS treatment, and a cross-sectional survey was performed to understand the perceptions in management of PCOS. Physicians from three hospital specialties (general gynecology, gynecological endocrinology, and reproductive endocrinology) in China were included. Results Responses from a total of 123 physicians were eligible for the final analysis, with 41 from each specialty. In DCE, the physicians mainly preferred the anti-androgen effect, lower probability of irregular bleeding, and additional benefits when selecting treatment for PCOS, and the decision making was found to be highly dependent on the presence of clinical hyperandrogenism. Regarding diagnostic criteria, polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) was the most frequently used (39.84%), followed by menstrual dysfunction (37.40%) and clinical hyperandrogenism (30.08%). Fertility and menstruation regulation were selected as the most important treatment goals for PCOS by physicians. Similar preferences across the three specialties were observed. Conclusion The decision making by physicians on PCOS treatment largely relies on the presence of clinical hyperandrogenism across all three specialties, indicating the significance of hyperandrogenism assessment in clinical practice, and the role of biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS treatment may require further elucidation in future clinical guidelines. Furthermore, the results emphasize the urgent need to bridge the gap between the clinical practice and guidance recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS in China.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common gynecological endocrine diseases in reproductive-aged women and has diverse clinical manifestations. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a cross-sectional survey were conducted to elicit preferences of physicians from multidisciplinary specialties for PCOS treatment and their perceptions of PCOS management in China.  What was learned from the study? When choosing treatments for PCOS, physicians mainly prioritized anti-androgen effects, lower probability of irregular bleeding, and additional benefits. Among diagnostic criteria, polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) was most commonly used (39.84%), followed by menstrual dysfunction (37.40%) and clinical hyperandrogenism (30.08%). Fertility enhancement and menstrual regulation were identified as the primary treatment goals. The findings highlight the urgent need to bridge the gap between current clinical practice and guideline recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS in China. Introduction Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common gynecological endocrine diseases in reproductive-aged women [ 1 2 3 6 7 The clinical manifestations of PCOS vary among individuals and across different age stages [ 3 8 9 1 9 10 9 10 11 6 12 13 15 1 15 16 18 There is currently no permanent cure for PCOS [ 10 11 10 11 1 4 10 19 20 15 Evidence-based medicine is essential to achieve ideal patient outcomes via informed decision-making on diagnosis and treatments using the best available evidence [ 21 13 13 9 13 15 22 24 Existing literature reported that the clinical practice of PCOS in China may differ by the trainings received or previous physician experience with PCOS or the clinical specialties [ 23 24 To address these gaps, this study aimed to elicit multi-disciplinary physicians’ preferences regarding the features of PCOS treatments in China via a discrete choice experiment (DCE). DCE is a stated preference technique based on utility theory and has been widely used in fields such as health economics, operations research, and environmental studies, providing valuable insights for policy-making that reflect public priorities [ 25 26 27 28 Methods Design of DCE Selection of Attributes and Levels In a DCE study, selecting the attributes and levels is crucial for validity [ 29 27 9 13 14 19 1 Table 1 Attributes and levels for the discrete choice experiment Scenario Scenario 1 Presence of both clinical hyperandrogenism and biochemical hyperandrogenism Scenario 2 Presence of clinical hyperandrogenism only Scenario 3 Presence of biochemical hyperandrogenism only Scenario 4 No presence of clinical hyperandrogenism nor biochemical hyperandrogenism Attribute Level Effect of anti-androgen Yes No (reference) Probability of irregular bleeding 10–25% 5–10% (reference) Additional benefits (contraception and relief of dysmenorrhea) Yes No (reference) Management of VTE risk Need to exclude people at risk of thrombosis Estimated VTE incidence: 3–9/10,000 female person-years No need to exclude people at risk of thrombosis Estimated VTE incidence: 1.06–5.30/10,000 female person-years (reference) Dosing regimen Taken in continuous cycles, once a day, orally Taken on days 11–25 of the menstrual cycle, twice a day, orally (reference) PCOS VTE Moreover, as hyperandrogenism is a key feature of PCOS [ 30 1 To ease understanding and reduce cognitive burden to the respondents, the context of the DCE questions was designed to describe the most frequently observed scenario in clinical practice, simplified to a hypothetical PCOS patient with no recent fertility needs, as verified by qualitative interviews with physicians. The context reads as: A female PCOS patient of reproductive age comes to your department for treatment. The patient has menstrual abnormalities, no other metabolic abnormalities that seriously affect menstrual regulation or anti-androgenic treatment, and no recent fertility needs. DCE Development We used SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., 2024) to generate the choice sets based on experimental design principles [ 26 29 29 2 Table 2 Example of a choice set (translated from Chinese) A female PCOS patient of childbearing age comes to your department for treatment. The patient has menstrual abnormalities, no other metabolic abnormalities that seriously affect menstrual regulation or anti-androgenic treatment, and no recent plans to have children. The patient presents clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism. Which of the following two virtual drugs that can be used to regulate the patient's menstrual cycle would you prefer to prescribe to the PCOS patient? Treatment A Treatment B Effect of anti-androgen No Effect of anti-androgen Yes Probability of irregular bleeding 5–10% Probability of irregular bleeding 10–25% Additional benefits (contraception and  relief of dysmenorrhea) No Additional benefits (contraception and relief of dysmenorrhea) No Management of VTE risk Need to exclude people at risk of thrombosis Estimated VTE incidence: 3–9/10,000 female person-years Management of VTE risk No need to exclude people at risk of thrombosis Estimated VTE incidence: 1.06–5.30/10,000 female person-years Dosing regimen Taken on days 11–25 of the menstrual cycle, twice a day, orally Dosing regimen Taken in continuous cycles, once a day, orally Select \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\checkmark$$\\end{document} ✓ Select \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\checkmark$$\\end{document} ✓ PCOS VTE Sample Size, Study Population, and Data Collection The sample size was calculated using the rule of thumb proposed by Ryan et al., requiring a minimum of 30 respondents per scenario [ 31 1 31 Target respondents were physicians in tertiary hospitals in China with PCOS treatment experience and a title of chief physician or above. Respondents were recruited from three hospital specialties including general gynecology, gynecologic endocrinology, and reproductive endocrinology, where patients with PCOS are mostly received as identified in qualitative interviews with physicians and in literature [ 23 n Data Analyses Data analyses were conducted with R software (R Core Team, 2024). A mixed logit model was used to capture variability in individual preferences [ 25 28 32 33 In addition, subgroup analyses were performed, aiming to identify the preference heterogeneity among the physicians from different hospital specialties. A conditional logit model was used where the mixed logit model did not converge. Survey Design and Analyses A structured questionnaire included questions on physician demographics, PCOS diagnostic criteria, treatment, and long-term management. The questionnaire was established based on evidence-based guidelines [ 13 19 Ethical Approval This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of School of Public Health Fudan University (IRB#2024-04-1104). Consent was obtained from all individual participants in the study. Results Demographic and Practice Characteristics of Physicians In total, the survey was sent to 548 platform users, with 137 responses (response rate 25%). Fourteen missed at least one question and were excluded, leaving 123 participants for the final analysis, with 41 participants from each of the three hospital specialties of general gynecology, gynecological endocrinology, and reproductive endocrinology.

Figure 1 P S1 Fig. 1 Coefficient and relative importance of each attribute under each hyperandrogenism scenario. a b VTE In both Scenario 1 and 2 (with clinical hyperandrogenism), the effect of antiandrogen was the only statistically significant attribute, with physicians highly preferring treatments with antiandrogenic effect (coefficient 2.31 and 2.07, 95% CI [1.21, 3.42] and [1.08, 3.07], respectively). In Scenarios 3 and 4 (no clinical hyperandrogenism), irregular bleeding probability and additional benefits were significant. Physicians showed strong aversion to the higher probability of irregular bleeding (coefficient − 0.57, 95% CI [− 0.91, − 0.24] in Scenario 3; coefficient − 0.68, 95% CI [− 1.09, − 0.27] in Scenario 4) and preference for additional benefits including contraception and relief of dysmenorrhea (coefficient 0.28, 95% CI [0.01, 0.55] in Scenario 3; coefficient 0.60, 95% CI [0.18, 1.01] In Scenario 4). In Scenario 3 (biochemical hyperandrogenism only), physicians seemed ignorant of the efficacy of anti-androgen in the treatment. In Scenario 4, the effect of antiandrogen was also statistically significant; however, the negative sign indicated that the antiandrogenic effect was not preferred by physicians (coefficient – 0.58, 95% CI [− 1.13, − 0.03]). Across all scenarios, management of VTE risk and dosing regimen were not statistically significant. The RI varied across scenarios. Anti-androgen had the highest RI in the settings of treating patients with clinical hyperandrogenism, regardless of the present of biochemical hyperandrogenism (80% vs. 77% in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, respectively). In Scenario 3, where patients only had biochemical hyperandrogenism, the respondents gave the highest importance to irregular bleeding (44%), followed by additional benefits (22%) and management of VTE risk (17%). In Scenario 4, where patients had no hyperandrogenism, the respondents gave higher importance to the probability of irregular bleeding (30%), additional benefits (27%), and effect of anti-androgen (26%) compared to the management of VTE risk (11%) and dosing regimen (6%). Subgroup analyses showed similar preferences across the three hospital specialties, with some differences (Table S2). In both Scenario 1 and 2, physicians from different hospital specialties all highly preferred treatments that had the effect of antiandrogen, with no significant preference for VTE risk management. Only reproductive endocrinologists significantly preferred treatments with lower irregular bleeding probability in Scenario 2, likely because of their focus on fertility needs. Survey Results Survey results (Figure S1 For hyperandrogenism assessment, 86.18% of respondents used both clinical and biochemical methods, 10.57% used clinical only, and 2.44% used biochemical only. Hirsutism and androgenetic alopecia were the most used criteria for clinical hyperandrogenism. Fertility and menstruation regulation were the most important treatment goals (mean importance score 4.82 and 4.51). VTE risk assessment was reported as often (34.96%) or sometimes (33.33%). Regarding the treatment for patients with PCOS, 69.92% of the physicians chose to prescribe COCs for patients with severe hyperandrogenism, and the proportion decreased to 51.22% when patients had mild/no hyperandrogenism, while the proportion of choosing to prescribe progesterone increased from 10.57 to 30.08%. Estrogen-progestin treatment proportions remained similar. Subgroup analysis showed consistency in hyperandrogenism diagnosis methods, treatment goals, and VTE risk management across the three specialties, with some differences in diagnostic criteria and treatment for patients with PCOS (Table S4). Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study to elicit and quantify the preferences of PCOS treatment by physicians from multiple specialties in China. The DCE revealed heterogeneous preferences across different clinical and hyperandrogenism scenarios. When clinical hyperandrogenism was present on patients with PCOS, antiandrogenic effect was the most important attribute, regardless of biochemical hyperandrogenism, for physicians in the three specialties including general gynecology, gynecological endocrinology, and reproductive endocrinology. This finding shows a widespread consensus among physicians across various specialties regarding the central role of addressing clinical hyperandrogenism in PCOS treatment, aligning closely with clinical guidelines [ 13 22 Clinical practice guidelines for PCOS assessment and management [ 13 22 19 1 19 1 19 Previous literature reported that the risks of cardiovascular disease and VTE are important factors in PCOS treatment selections [ 34 35 Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, selection bias may exist as the physicians were recruited through an online platform and the response rate of the survey was not high. However, the platform used has extensive coverage, reaching over 95% of tertiary hospitals across China, which enhanced the generalizability of the study participants. Notably, the proportion of respondents from East China (50.41%) closely aligns with the actual healthcare resource landscape in China, where approximately 45% of tertiary hospitals are located in East China [ 36 31 37 38 Conclusions The results of this study indicate that physicians mainly preferred anti-androgenic effect, lower probability of irregular bleeding, and additional benefits when selecting treatments for PCOS, and the decision making highly relies on the presence of clinical hyperandrogenism. This finding underscores the significance of hyperandrogenism assessment in clinical practice across all three specialties including general gynecology, gynecological endocrinology, and reproductive endocrinology. The results also highlight the need to clarify the use of biochemical hyperandrogenism as an indicator of guiding PCOS treatment in clinical guidelines. Discrepancies still exist between the clinical practice and guidance recommendations for PCOS diagnosis and treatment in China. It is important to harmonize the clinical management of PCOS and promote the health literacy of patients with PCOS to achieve better health outcomes.
