Although the longer‐term metabolic effects of these fats are well evidenced, their postprandial effects remain inconclusive. In this randomized crossover trial, 29 participants with increased cardiometabolic risk consumed four isoenergetic meals containing 25 or 50 g (low‐fat meals [LFMs], high‐fat meals [HFMs]) of canola or coconut oil. Blood samples for analysis of triglycerides (TGs), glucose, insulin, nonesterified FAs (NEFAs), IL‐6, and individual FAs were collected in the fasting state and 6 h postprandially (every 0.5–1 h). The incremental areas under the curves (iAUCs) of TGs and IL‐6 were higher after canola than after coconut oil. Concentrations of lauric and myristic acid were higher after coconut oil, while concentrations of oleic, linoleic, and α‐linolenic acid were higher after canola oil. The TG iAUC was higher after HFMs than after corresponding LFMs. NEFAs decreased more after LFMs than after HFMs. The glucose and insulin iAUCs were higher after LFMs than after HFMs. Canola and coconut oil induced different metabolic responses. The manner and strength of the postprandial effects differed depending on the parameter. In this randomized crossover study, 29 participants with increased cardiometabolic risk consumed four isoenergetic, isonitrogenous meals containing 25 or 50 g of canola or coconut oil. Blood samples (e.g., for analysis of lipid, glucose, and insulin metabolism) were collected in the fasting state and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 h postprandially. Besides, vascular function was assessed by measuring arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, augmentation index) before the test meals and 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 h postprandially. arterial stiffness canola oil cardiometabolic risk coconut oil triglyceride response Union for the Promotion of Oil and Protein Crops e. V.

Table 1 2.4 Measurements 2.4.1 Anthropometrics Weight and height were measured using a stadiometer with an integrated scale (seca 704; Seca, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.05 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively. Waist and hip circumferences were measured in duplicate with the participants in an upright position using a flexible tape to an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest while participants were breathing calmly. Hip circumference was measured at the level of the maximum circumference above the pubic bone. Body composition (fat and fat‐free mass) was determined by air‐displacement plethysmography using the BOD POD body composition system (Cosmed, Rome, Italy) according to the instruction manual. 2.4.2 BP and Heart Rate Systolic and diastolic BP as well as heart rate were determined using an automatic BP measurement device (Boso Carat Professional; Bosch + Sohn GmbH, Jungingen, Germany) in a sitting position. The measurements were performed in duplicate under standardized conditions and according to international guidelines [ 39 2.4.3 Blood Sample Processing and Analysis Fasting and postprandial blood samples were collected via an indwelling venous cannula (Vasofix Safety; B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) and drawn into tubes containing EDTA, fluoride, or a coagulation activator (SARSTEDT AG & Co. KG, Nümbrecht, Germany). Plasma and serum were obtained by centrifugation at 3000 × g Serum TGs, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were analyzed by fully automated photometric methods and the plasma glucose by the hexokinase method on a cobas c702 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Serum insulin concentrations were analyzed by fully automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (ECLIA, Elecsys tests) on a cobas e801 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) was calculated using the following formula: (insulin concentration [mU/L] × glucose concentration [mg/dL])/405. The insulin–glucose ratio was determined by dividing the insulin concentration (pmol/L) by the glucose concentration (mmol/L). Serum CRP concentrations were measured using a turbidimetric immunoassay (cobas c702, Roche Diagnostics). Blood count parameters were analyzed by fluorescence flow cytometry, the resistance measurement technique, and photometry using a hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN9000 and Sysmex XN1000; Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). Serum gamma‐glutamyl transferase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, lipase, total bilirubin, and creatinine were measured by fully automated photometric methods (cobas c702, Roche Diagnostics). An in vitro enzymatic colorimetric method assay (NEFA‐HR(2); FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals Europe GmbH, Neuss, Germany) was used to measure the serum NEFA concentration in duplicate. The plasma concentration of IL‐6 was analyzed in duplicate using a commercially available ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). Plasma concentrations of α‐ and γ‐tocopherol were determined via HPLC as described previously [ 40 41 42 2.4.4 Parameters of Arterial Stiffness PWV c‐f c‐f 2.4.5 Self‐Reported Physical Activity and Dietary Intake of Energy and Nutrients Participants were instructed to complete a 1‐day food diary and physical activity log on the day before each study visit to identify possible variations in food intake and physical activity. The food diaries were analyzed using the computer‐based nutrient calculation program EBISpro (University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany). Each subject additionally completed a 3‐day food diary once before the start of the study to assess their habitual diet. 2.5 Statistical Analyses The postprandial TG concentration was used as the primary outcome to determine the sample size. The calculation was based on data from previous postprandial studies of the study group with comparable study designs [ 43 44 p All statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS statistical software package, version 28 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Data were analyzed according to a prespecified analysis plan, which was finalized before outcome data were available. The significance level was set at 0.05. Baseline characteristics of men and women were compared using the unpaired Student's t The effects of the interventions (fat type: coconut oil and canola oil; fat amount: low‐fat and high‐fat), time points (fasting and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 h postprandially), and their interactions (fat amount × fat type, fat amount × time, fat type × time, and fat amount × fat type × time) on all postprandial parameters were tested using a linear mixed model with repeated measures; time within a subject and period was treated as repeated effect. The interventions, time points, and their interactions were set as fixed factors, as were the visit, but without interaction with the previous ones. The subject identifier was included as a random variable, and the fasting value was included as a covariate. When there was no significant interaction between the factors, the linear mixed model was repeated without the respective interaction term. To assess the adequacy of the statistical tests, the residuals resulting from the analysis were assessed for a normal distribution. When there were non‐normally distributed residuals, the linear mixed model was rerun with log‐transformed data. Additionally, for each parameter, the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule and analyzed using the linear mixed model. Here, fat type, fat amount, and their interaction as well as the visit were set as fixed factors. The subject identifier was included as a random variable. 3 Results 3.1 Baseline Characteristics In total, 30 participants were included in this study.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial on canola and coconut oil that analyzed a wide range of parameters addressing the metabolic response and arterial stiffness as well as the postprandial FA profile. Our major finding was that consumption of canola oil resulted in a stronger TG response than consumption of coconut oil. The strong increase of the TG concentration observed after canola oil consumption may be attributed to the fact that canola oil consists almost entirely of FAs with a chain length of at least 16 carbon atoms, which are incorporated into chylomicrons and released into the systemic circulation via the lymphatic system [ 45 46 Another reason for the observed effect of fat type on the TG concentration may be possible differences in the degradation behavior of chylomicrons with varying compositions because it has been suggested that FA classes influence the composition of TG‐rich lipoproteins [ 47 In addition to the differential effect of fat type on the lipemic response, we found a robust effect of fat amount on lipemia, meaning that the higher fat dose of a plant oil (HFMs, 50 g test oil) triggered a stronger TG response than the corresponding meal with the lower fat dose (LFMs, 25 g test oil). This finding is consistent with the well‐established concept that the TG response gradually increases with an increasing dietary fat dose [ 48 49 43 44 50 51 In the present study, ingestion of all four meals induced glycemia and insulinemia as well as significant increases in the derived parameters HOMA‐IR and the insulin–glucose ratio. The intensive insulin secretion between 0.5 and 2.0 h postprandially caused a rapid decline of the glucose concentration to values below the baseline after it had peaked at 0.5 h after meal consumption. The more extensive glycemic and insulinemic response after LFMs can be attributed to their higher contents of carbohydrates (LFMs: 144.1 g vs. HFMs: 85.5 g) and mono‐ and disaccharides (LFMs: 73.2 g vs. HFMs: 39.9 g) than HFMs. This is consistent with a recent meta‐analysis describing the attenuating effect on acute glucose and insulin responses by exchanging carbohydrates for fats in mixed meals [ 52 53 54 55 56 Insulin is a potent inhibitor of intracellular lipases [ 57 58 57 59 In a comprehensive review of the inflammatory response to single HFMs, Emerson et al. [ 60 43 44 61 62 63 64 65 r r ab 66 67 After ingestion of HFMs, we observed significant increases in serum concentration of FAs derived from oils, meaning that the concentrations of lauric and myristic acid strongly increased in response to the coconut oil‐containing HFM, while the concentrations of oleic, linoleic, and α‐linolenic acid markedly increased after the canola oil‐containing HFM. Analogous to the serum FA profile, we were able to depict the postprandial change in γ‐tocopherol. The concentration increased most after the canola oil‐containing HFM (20 mg γ‐tocopherol/50 g canola oil), followed by the canola oil‐containing LFM (10 mg γ‐tocopherol/25 g canola oil). No increment was observed after the coconut oil‐containing meals due to the fact that γ‐tocopherol could not be detected in this oil. The absence of an increase in the α‐tocopherol level during the postprandial period can be explained by a relatively high α‐tocopherol concentration at baseline, especially compared to γ‐tocopherol, and a rather low α‐tocopherol intake via the test meals. In this study, consumption of all meals significantly decreased AIx, which is in accordance with the results of our recently published review [ 68 c‐f c‐f 68 69 70 c‐f c‐f 71 72 c‐f 73 4.1 Strengths and Limitations The main strengths of this study are the randomized crossover design, controlled setting, and high treatment compliance. Strong deviations in the environmental conditions would have been apparent and could have been considered in the data analysis by monitoring nutrient intake and physical activity on pretreatment days. The well‐planned protocol enabled us to analyze a great variety of metabolic parameters and the vascular response. Short time intervals between blood collections allowed us to continuously monitor postprandial responses, which is beneficial with regard to the rapid changes in metabolic parameters such as glucose and insulin levels. The determination of the postprandial serum FA profile in addition to common metabolic parameters enabled us to better understand the effects of the two test oils on the TG response. Compared with previous studies [ 43 44 69 74 75 Despite the prolonged observation period, the TG concentration was still above the preprandial level after 6 h. A further extension of the observation period would have allowed us to describe the metabolic response in even greater detail, but would have placed too great a burden on the study participants. When interpreting the significant effects of fat amount (e.g., on glucose, insulin), it should be noted that the variation in fat content between HFMs and LFMs was accompanied by a variation in carbohydrate content, as the meals were intended to be isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. Another potential limitation of this study is that the results are of limited transferability to other populations (e.g., metabolically healthy individuals); however, especially for the vulnerable group of participants with increased cardiometabolic risk, attenuating the postprandial metabolic response by dietary FA modification might be an effective strategy to reduce the CVD risk [ 76 5 6 1 9 77 In conclusion, our results show that in adults with a risk phenotype for CVDs, both the meal fat amount and its FA composition affect cardiometabolic risk factors. Canola and coconut oil induced different metabolic responses, and the manner and strength of the effects differed depending on the parameter. For the further physiological evaluation of dietary fats, more well‐designed and highly standardized studies on the acute and longer‐term metabolic effects of plant oils used in modern cuisine are needed. Future studies should consider the following aspects in particular: postprandial period of at least 6–8 h, randomized crossover design, well‐characterized intervention (e.g., analyzed composition of test meals), further studies with different study populations (e.g., metabolically healthy individuals, risk phenotype, or risk genotype for CVDs), and measurement of a wide range of physiological and immunological parameters.
