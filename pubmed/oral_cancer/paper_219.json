Background Hepatitis B virus causes life-threatening chronic liver infection and increases the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. A three-dose series of universal HBV vaccination initiated from birth is effective against the disease. It is unclear if catch-up vaccination is also effective in those with incomplete or no HBV vaccination. Objective To review the evidence on the effect of HBV catch-up vaccination on children and adults to decrease HBV-related morbidity. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, ChinaXiv, MedRXIV, BioRXIV, Google Scholar, and ongoing and completed trials on USA: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ http://www.chictr.org.cn/searchprojen.aspx https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform Results A total of four observational studies were included, one of which had data in children and adults [two (one with data in adults) studies in children; 3 in adults]. The cross-sectional study was assessed as good quality; and the three cohorts as fair to good. In children, a high certainty evidence study showed that catch up vaccination in 9 to 18 years old decreased risk of HBsAg positivity [RR: 0.09 (0.004, 0.21)], reduced HBV DNA detection [RR: 0.084 (0.026, 0.273)], and increased anti-HBs seroconversion [RR: 2.08 (1.84, 2.33)]. The quality of evidence was deemed high based on a large treatment effect. Another low certainty evidence study in Italy showed that HBV mass immunization in 0-10 years old decreased the prevalence of HBsAg anti-HBc and increased anti-HBs seroconversion after vaccination. In adults, three low certainty evidence studies were included. Two studies showed decreased incidence of acute hepatitis B [OR: 0.08 (0.05, 0.12), I2 = 33%]. Another study demonstrated a decreased prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma with HBV vaccination with the incidence ratio of vaccinated with chronically infected at 0.04 (0.02, 0.07) showing a large magnitude of benefit for vaccination against HCC when chronic HBV infection is prevented. The studies were deemed to have low quality due to issue of directness and study design. Conclusion HBV catch-up vaccination in adults is effective in decreasing the prevalence of acute hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma. It likewise decreased the prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, and provided anti-HBs protection in 0 to 18 years.

HBV universal vaccination has been shown to be effective in decreasing the incidence of HBVrelated morbidities and mortality including acute 1 2 3 7 8 1 9 11 12 13 METHODS Criteria for Considering Studies for this Review We considered experimental or observational studies, meta-analysis/systematic reviews, completed trials, and preprints that investigated the efficacy of catch-up HBV immunization in decreasing morbidity and mortality from hepatitis B infection including acute and chronic hepatitis B infection, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The search was performed in duplicate by two researchers. There was no language restriction applied in the search. Both pediatric and adult patients were included. Outcome measure after HBV catch-up vaccination included prevalence of: (a) HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc; (b) acute hepatitis B infection, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure.

We reevaluated the full text of any potentially eligible reports and excluded those studies that did not meet all of the inclusion criteria. We discussed any disagreements until we achieved consensus. Quality of Included Studies Two reviewers assessed independently the quality of the included studies using Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort and cross-sectional studies ( Appendix 3 Assessment of Overall Certainty of Evidence and Data Management GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach was used to determine the certainty of evidence. 14 RESULTS Characteristic of Included Study ( Appendix 4 After a thorough search, there were no RCTs that looked into catch-up vaccination among healthy children and adults in reducing hepatitis B-related outcomes. There were four observational studies (three cohorts, one cross-sectional) that were included. There were two studies in pediatrics 2 6 1 2 11 2 6 6 1 11 Pediatrics A cross-sectional study in Nunavut, Canada included participants who had blood taken for unrelated medical tests. 6 Appendix 5 Another cohort study in Afragola, Italy from 1983 to 1989 included 7,000 children up to 10 years and compared the infection rate of HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs in 1978 before HBV vaccination in the country and in 1989 after the mass vaccination. 2 Adults There were three observational studies in adults. The quality of evidence of these studies was deemed low due to issues of directness and study design ( Appendix 6 A cohort study done in Korea recruited 370,285 males aged >30 seen in a health examination program for government employees. 11 Two other cohort studies compared the incidence of acute symptomatic hepatitis B infection before and after completion of immunization. 1 2 1 2 Chronic Hepatitis B Carriers and Anti-HBs Seroconversion Pediatrics The study in Canada showed a decrease in HBsAg prevalence after catch-up vaccination of students from Grade 4 up to high school (usually between 9-18 years) compared to the period before universal vaccination. 6 The HBV mass immunization study in Italy in children 0-10 years revealed that after vaccination, HBsAg prevalence decreased from 9.2% to 1%, anti-HBc from 49.7% to 3%, and anti-HBs was noted in 63% of subject. 2 Adults Incidence of acute hepatitis B infection The study in Alaska demonstrated that after screening and identification of 44,100 susceptible individuals, catchup vaccination decreased the incidence of acute hepatitis B infection from 215/100,000 in 1982 to 14/100,000 in 1986. 1 2 2 Figure 1 Figure 1 Pooled incidence rate of acute hepatitis B infection before and after HBV catch-up vaccination. Prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma A total of 302 cases of HCC in Korea identified between 1983 to 1989 and the overall incidence rate of HCC during this period was 21.7 per 100,000 person-years with different incident rates according to the serological status of the person. 11 Table 1 Table 1 Incidence Rate of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Korea in 370,285 Males Categorized according to the Serological Test for Hepatitis B 11 Incidence Rate of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (person-years)   Chronically infected 215.9/100,000    Unvaccinated with natural immunity 4.4/100,000    Vaccinated 8/100,000    Susceptible 13.7/100,000 DISCUSSION Our present review showed that catch-up vaccination whether in children or adults is effective in decreasing the prevalence of acute hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma in adults and in decreasing the prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, and providing anti-HBs protection if given in individuals less than 18 years. HBsAg is used as a marker of acute or chronic infection, anti-HBc for past HBV exposure, and anti-HBs as an indicator if the person has developed life-long immunity to the disease. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can cause an acute or chronic infection. In 2019, there were around ≈300 million chronic infections worldwide resulting in 820,000 deaths from cirrhosis and liver cancer annually. 15 16 17 6 2 HBV vaccination provides benefit if administered at any age in unvaccinated individuals as it will prevent the infection of the individual and for the virus to be transmitted to another person. 1 18 The protective effect of HBV vaccination was demonstrated in the observational studies conducted in Alaska 1 2 19 19 20 It can also be inferred from our findings that HBV vaccination decreased the incidence of hepatocelullar carcinoma in adult as shown in South Korea based on an over one million person years of follow up. 11 21 22 HBV vaccine is also affordable, with a three-dose series amounting to US$30 at US$10 per vial. In China, a costeffectiveness analysis was done to assess the hepatitis B catch-up program. Using a Markov model, the HBV catchup immunization program of children 1-19 years old was reported to have a 97% chance of being cost-saving and a 98% chance of having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $2,500 per QALY gained. 12 23 24 25 26 27 28 The review was limited by the available information on HBV catch-up vaccination as most of the studies were on the effect of the primary HBV series and not on those with incomplete or unknown vaccination status. All included studies were observational which were more prone to bias and confounding. In the study on effect of HBV vaccine on hepatocellular carcinoma, selection bias was present as the population was limited to male participants while in the incidence of acute hepatitis B infection, the data involved both children and adults. Sampling bias may also exist for the evidence on HBV catch-up vaccination in children as HBV vaccination status was only assumed based on the age of the patient with no medical records or vaccination card to verify it. Nonetheless, the report provides important information on HBV catch-up vaccination as its implementation will provide optimal protection against the sequelae of the disease especially in an endemic country like the Philippines. In conclusion, HBV catch-up vaccination in adults is effective in decreasing the prevalence of acute hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma. It likewise decreased the prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, and provided anti-HBs protection in 0 to 18 years. Recommendations on HBV Catch-up Vaccination from Other Groups Centers for Disease Control 24 The CDC recommends the following for HBV catch-up immunization: Unvaccinated persons should complete a 3-dose series at 0, 1–2, 6 months. Adolescent age 11–15 years may use an alternative 2-dose of adult recombinant formulation schedule with at least 4 months between doses. Adolescent age 18 years or older may receive a 2-dose series of adjuvanted Hepatitis B vaccine at least 4 weeks apart. Adolescent age 18 years or older may receive the combined HepA and HepB vaccine as a 3-dose series (0, 1, and 6 months) or 4-dose series (3 doses at 0, 7, and 21–30 days, followed by a booster dose at 12 months). American Academy of Pediatrics 2021 25 Administer the 3-dose series to those not previously vaccinated at 1 month interval for the first two doses and the third dose after eight weeks or at least 16 weeks from the first dose. A 2-dose series 4 weeks apart of adult formulation is licensed for children aged 11 through 15 years. American Association for the Study of Liver Disease 26 Follow-up testing is recommended for those who remain at risk of infection, such as HCWs, infants of HBsAg-positive mothers, sexual partners of persons with CHB, chronic hemodialysis patients, and immunocompromised persons, including those with HIV. Annual testing of hemodialysis patients is recommended given that immunity wanes rapidly in these individuals who are at a high risk of continued exposure to HBV. Booster doses are not indicated in immunocompetent individuals if the primary vaccination series is completed, as long-term follow-up studies indicated that immune memory persists despite declining anti-HBs levels. For individuals undergoing postvaccination serological testing, especially immunocompromised patients (such as persons on dialysis or with chronic inflammatory conditions, including HIV), a booster injection is advised when the anti-HBs titer falls below 10 mIU/mL. Philippine Society of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) 27 Among high-risk groups, the standard hepatitis B vaccination schedule of 0,1 and 6 months should be used to confer long term protection among highrisk groups who do not need immediate protection and rapid seroconversion. Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines 28 For 1-18 years old, administer three doses at 0, 1 and 6 months for those not previously vaccinated.
