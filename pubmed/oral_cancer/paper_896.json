Reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration dominate because they deliver permeate with very low impurities. Their principal limitation is membrane biofouling, which causes clogging, raises energy, operation, and maintenance costs, and shortens membrane life. Multiple approaches mitigate biofouling—most notably pretreatment trains and engineered surface coatings—but cleaning remains the most decisive remediation pathway. Current practice distinguishes physical, chemical, and biological cleaning. Biological cleaning has gained momentum by exploiting microorganisms that inherently counter biofilms. These strategies include targeted secretion of enzymes and antifouling metabolites, and the application of whole-cell culture supernatants containing the full suite of secreted components. In addition, predatory bacteria can infiltrate established biofilms and eradicate them by lysing prey, thereby accelerating the removal of adherent biomass. Progress across these bio-based approaches signals meaningful advances in fouling control and could substantially improve the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of desalination facilities. Collectively, they underscore the transformative potential of biological antifouling agents in operational systems. Realizing that potential will require rigorous evaluation of technical performance, long-term stability, compatibility with polyamide membranes, regulatory acceptance, and environmental safety, ultimately alongside scalable production and cost-effective deployment in full-scale plants. biofouling antifouling reverse osmosis biosurfactants quorum-quenching desalination Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) IT24I0016 This research was funded by Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID) (grant number IT24I0016). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The global population is projected to increase to 9.7 billion by 2050 [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 To frame subsequent biotechnological approaches, we first summarize state-of-practice non-biological controls placed upstream of, or applied periodically to, the following RO elements: (i) pretreatment trains (e.g., coagulation–flocculation, filtration, UVC/ozone) that reduce biofoulant load [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 In the 1960s, the initial desalination plants were established in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia taking a leading role by producing 22% of the world’s desalinated water. In 2004, the first reverse osmosis desalination plants in South America commenced operations in Antofagasta, northern Chile, to support the Minera Escondida Limitada sulfide leaching project [ 20 Numerous water desalination methodologies are utilized to derive potable water from coastal regions, which can be broadly categorized into two main groups: thermal distillation and evaporation processes, and those employing physical membranes as the principal purification mechanism, including electrodialysis, membrane distillation [ 21 3 22 23 24 25 26 One of the most significant challenges in reverse osmosis desalination systems is the emergence of biofouling on membranes, which has implications for operational and maintenance costs [ 27 28 29 30 From a regulatory perspective, the integration of biologically derived cleaners or live/engineered quorum-quenching agents into potable water trains must align with the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (GDWQ) [ 31 32 33 34 35 35 Figure 1 29 36 The continuous application of membranes results in the persistent accumulation of fouling on the surface and/or internal pores of the membrane, leading to obstruction and a reduction in permeate flow [ 15 2+ 2+ 2+ + 3 2− 4 2− − 4 3− 12 15 16 37 37 38 Biofouling, in its initial state known as microfouling, is characterized by an aggregation of microbial cells at an interface, which are encapsulated within an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. Specifically, in seawater desalination plants, biofouling results in a decline in the efficacy of ultrafiltration modules and a reduction in permeability flux across reverse osmosis membranes. This phenomenon necessitates elevated pressure to facilitate water movement within these systems, from the feed inlet of a component to the outlet, thereby augmenting energy expenses [ 17 18 2. Cleaning Reverse Osmosis Membrane Systems To prolong the operational lifespan of reverse osmosis membranes utilized in the desalination industry, a range of preventive and corrective strategies has been employed. These strategies include water pretreatment technologies [ 20 22 2.1. Antifouling Methods Membrane washing strategies are employed when membrane performance diminishes by 10 to 15%, resulting in a decrease in permeability, necessitating cleaning interventions through the partial cessation of water production. This process involves the removal of membranes affected by biofouling and their subsequent introduction into washing modules. Various washing strategies are available to address fouling in desalination systems, which are classified based on their characteristics. It is important to note that none of these systems completely eradicates microfouling; however, they are effective in eliminating a portion of it, thus facilitating the restoration of permeate volumes and recovering a portion of production [ 22 In this context, the four key criteria that a chemical treatment must fulfill to be deemed effective are delineated by Madaeni and Samieirad (2010) [ 13 The initial antifouling agents employed were chemical in nature, most notably tributyltin (TBT) during the 1950s. This highly toxic biocide elicited detrimental effects in marine organisms and humans, including genetic mutations, which ultimately led to its prohibition in 2008 by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) [ 35 39 Table 1 40 2 41 42 2.2. Biological Methods, Biofouling: Problem and Opportunity? Beyond constraints, biofouling ecology presents actionable opportunities: (i) mining biofilm consortia for robust EPS-depolymerizing enzymes (alginate lyases, DNases, proteases) [ 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 Biofouling represents a complex biological environment [ 38 58 59 60 61 62 63 Lactobacillus Pseudomonas fluorescens 64 Burkholderia thailandensis, Bacillus subtilis 2.2.1. Antifouling Compounds Isolated from Microorganisms The antifouling activity originating from biological resources, including bacteria, can be ascribed to various molecules secreted into the extracellular environment, which affect the EPS matrix or modulate bacterial survival. Biological antifouling agents have been identified through investigations in living organisms that demonstrate their efficacy against membrane fouling. These agents exhibit diverse mechanisms of action, application methods, and sources ( Figure 2 Table 2 Cis-2-decenoic acid, a molecule produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 65 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 39 The utilization of enzymes presents a promising approach to address contemporary fouling challenges. In particular, lipases and proteases produced by species such as Candida cylindracea Pseudomonas mendocina Aspergillus oryzae Bacillus licheniformis 50 Pseudomonas 67 The issue of fouling is not restricted to membranes but also impacts submerged surfaces. Consequently, various alternatives have been investigated to mitigate this phenomenon. A notable example is portoamides, a cyclic peptide derived from the cyanobacterium Phormidium 68 61 Streptomyces aculeolatus 69 A recent study conducted by Zahidullah et al. (2022) has examined the antimicrobial efficacy of rhamnolipids in the management of biofilm formation and dispersal, as well as their extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), in reverse osmosis membranes [ 70 71 72 42 70 71 43 73 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 74 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 75 membranes-15-00270-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Presents a summary of key bioactive compounds derived from microbial sources that exhibit antifouling potential, outlining their microbial origin, mechanism of action, and principal targets in membrane biofouling systems.

Quorum-Quenching One strategy to mitigate fouling involves the application of quorum-quenching (QQ), a method predicated on the disruption of quorum sensing (QS) [ 46 82 46 47 77 83 Three bacterial genera, Erythrobacter Labrenzia Bacterioplane Pseudomonas 44 84 Pseudoalteromona Altererythrobacter S1–5 S1–5 47 Engineered strategies for quorum-quenching (QQ) have been developed utilizing various methods to immobilize enzymes or bacteria possessing QQ activity. These methods include the application of magnetic carriers for the adherence of QQ enzymes, as well as the use of alginate beads or membranes as matrices for immobilizing enzymes or microorganisms [ 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 55 Brucella 45 Rhodococcus 56 Pseudomonas 86 Acinetobacter 87 Microbacterium 88 81 Kluyvera citrophila 89 For a method to effectively mitigate fouling formation, particularly through the QQ technique, it is imperative to consider the principal genes affected, which include CylA/CqsA/CqsS/TtrS/TtrR/LuxQ/LuxP/LuxN, in conjunction with genes associated with EPS formation, namely galE/nagB/ilvE/metH/phhA/serB. Inhibition of these genes will result in the blockade of QS signal perception [ 58 The Quorum Peps database ( https://quorumpeps.ugent.be/ 90 2.2.3. Bacteriocin Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides derived from bacteria, exhibiting considerable potential due to their diverse functions, which include food preservation, cancer therapies, and treatments against pathogens [ 60 61 62 91 Staphylococcus warneri Lactococcus lactis Staphylococcus aureus 60 78 Lactobacillus sakei Lactococcus lactis Listeria monocytogenes 79 80 Citrobacter freundii E. coli Citrobacter Klebsiella pneumoniae 81 2.2.4. Bacteriophage Bacteriophages represent a viable strategy for addressing biofouling due to their capacity for rapid and efficient infection of the host, which induces the production of enzymes such as depolymerases that degrade the protective matrix (extracellular polymeric substances), thereby facilitating infection [ 92 Escherichia coli 48 2.3. Biological Methods Employed Against Membranes in Desalination Systems Chemical clean-in-place (CIP) protocols based on hypochlorite or strong mineral acids remain the industrial default for mitigating biofouling in spiral-wound reverse osmosis (RO) membranes; nevertheless, the repeated oxidative and hydrolytic shocks inflicted by these reagents accelerate polymer chain scission, shorten module lifetime, inflate operating expenditures, and discharge chlorinated by-products that demand secondary treatment [ 93 94 95 Table 3 Unless otherwise stated, changes are relative to the baseline noted in each row (e.g., chemical CIP or clean-membrane control).Marine isolates such as Alteromonas Vibrio neptunius Pseudomonas aeruginosa 51 52 53 54 103 104 49 Alteromonas V. neptunius Table 4 Biological mitigation extends beyond soluble exudates. The fungal secondary metabolite (+)-terrein isolated from Aspergillus terreus OP185256 57 95 Because N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) orchestrate microbial surface sensing, attachment, and maturation, disrupting these chemical dialogs offers a highly selective mechanism to curb fouling [ 90 109 Rhodococcus 58 85 Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa 110 58 111 112 31 32 33 34 Table 5 Collectively, bacterial supernatants, metabolite-functionalized membranes, and QS-targeted interventions constitute a convergent, modular toolkit capable of mitigating biofilm formation, preserving membrane integrity, and enhancing trace-contaminant rejection—thereby aligning with both the operational imperatives and the environmental stewardship goals of next-generation desalination infrastructures. 3. Challenges and Future Perspectives Although the suite of biotechnological innovations reviewed herein represents a promising and inherently sustainable toolkit for mitigating biofouling in pilot-scale desalination facilities, a series of interrelated scientific, engineering, and regulatory challenges must still be overcome before broad industrial deployment can be contemplated. The most pressing knowledge gaps and development bottlenecks are summarized below. Long-term stability data remain sparse in field settings. a. Technoeconomic scalability: To make biological alternatives for biofouling control competitive in industrial-scale reverse osmosis (RO), the primary constraints are scale and cost rather than the agent’s intrinsic potency. At plant scale, an anti-biofouling supernatant from Alteromonas −1 −1 52 2 43 70 b. Physicochemical robustness and controlled delivery: Candidate molecules must retain bioactivity under the combined stresses of hypersalinity (>70 g L −1 113 c. Environmental fate and regulatory acceptance: Despite their inherent biodegradability, the chronic ecotoxicity of transformation products and their propensity to accumulate in brine streams are poorly characterized. Life-cycle assessment coupled with probabilistic environmental risk assessment, aligned with the EU Water Framework Directive and USEPA guidelines, will be indispensable to secure permitting and public acceptance. d. Hybrid membrane architecture: Rationally designed thin-film nanocomposites that co-immobilize bioactives with metal–organic frameworks or two-dimensional nanomaterials could deliver synergistic antifouling, antiscaling, and high selectivity performance; however, scalable interfacial polymerization routes that preserve both membrane integrity and bioactive functionality are still lacking. Aligned regulatory frameworks include the WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality [ 31 32 33 34 e. Predictive modeling and digital twins: Multiphysics simulations that combine computational fluid dynamics with molecular-scale interaction models are urgently needed to forecast the spatiotemporal distribution of bioactives, biofilm evolution, and resultant hydraulic impacts under dynamic operating scenarios [ 19 Consistent with Baransi-Karkaby et al. (2019) [ 95 4. Conclusions Biofouling remains a critical bottleneck in industrial water treatment infrastructure, especially at reverse osmosis desalination plants. Conventional countermeasures—pretreatment trains, surface coatings, and periodic physical–chemical cleanings—have delivered only incremental gains, often below the reliability and sustainability thresholds required by next-generation facilities. During the past decade, however, biologically inspired approaches centered on enzymatic hydrolases, quorum-quenching proteins, biosurfactants, and other bacterially derived metabolites have opened an evidence-based path toward substantive fouling control. Deploying these bioactive agents as in situ cleaning or conditioning additives reframes fouling mitigation as an ecological process that harnesses, rather than resists, microbial activity. Realizing this vision demands concerted progress in strain engineering, fermentation scale-up, formulation chemistry, and delivery hardware, together with transparent regulatory frameworks and proactive engagement from plant operators, equipment vendors, and environmental authorities. Convergent advances in synthetic biology, nanoconjugation, and data-driven process engineering are poised to overcome present performance and cost constraints, positioning customized bioactive cocktails as routine elements of desalination plant operating procedures. To accelerate adoption, future research must couple pilot-scale demonstrations with rigorous life-cycle and techno-economic assessments, address ecological trade-offs through mesocosm-based risk analysis, and establish harmonized guidelines for efficacy testing and discharge compliance. By integrating these scientific, engineering, and policy dimensions, the field can deliver fouling-resilient desalination that maximizes water-production efficiency while minimizing environmental footprint, thereby advancing the broader agenda of sustainable resource management.

Advantage Disadvantage Refs. Antifouling methods  Chemical High effectiveness in mitigating fouling. Significantly toxic to non-target organisms. [ 26 28 30 43  Physical Efficient in controlling fouling, enhancing water flow. Potential for long-term damage to membranes, coupled with considerable costs. [ 1 31 32 33 34 44 45  Biological High specificity in the regulation of fouling. Insufficiently researched, necessitating implementation on a pilot scale. [ 36 41 46 47 48 membranes-15-00270-t003_Table 3 Table 3 Comparative evaluation of biological vs. chemical treatments to mitigate biofouling on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Approach (Type) Mechanism/Typical Agent (s) Target Biofilm Stage Key Benefits Limits/Risks Performance (Verified Example) Best-Use Cases Refs Alteromonas Peptide/enzymatic CFS (~200 μg·mL −1 Mature EPS-rich biofilm on PA SWRO (3.5-yr fouled ROMs). Higher Pi/PR and lower conductivity vs. chemical; AFM recovery. Batch-to-batch QC; scale-up and SOP standardization. Pi 0.3747 vs. 0.3625; PR 0.7205 vs. 0.6873; lowest conductivity. Green CIP/hybrid when EPS dominates; avoids high-pH on PA. [ 52 Vibrio neptunius CFS (~250 μg·mL −1 Fouled ROMs; operational CF042 at high pressure/flux. Flux/permeate ≈ chemical; conductivity < 600 vs. ~615 μS·cm −1 Composition characterization ongoing; manufacturing/QA. Flux/permeate comparable; CLSM (ConA) ↓; AFM/SEM restored. Biological CIP in plant; removes EPS + biomass. [ 51 Xanthine oxidase + hypoxanthine (enzymatic, ROS-assisted) XO + hypoxanthine → ROS degrades polysaccharides. Mature EPS on industrially fouled PA RO membranes (bench cross-flow). Near-clean flux; ~50% polysaccharides ↓; rejection preserved. Dose control; ROS management; needs pilot-scale delivery to spiral-wound modules. Flux ~86.7% of clean; polysaccharides ↓ ~50%. Targeted EPS removal; pre-rinse. [ 84 Quorum-quenching (QQ) bacteria/enzymes (preventive) QQ degrades AHL; immobilized columns. Early/mid-stage formation (signal disruption). Non-toxic; continuous use. Lab/pilot; immobilization/regulatory. In MBRs, exogenous QQ may shift communities and briefly raise biofouling—place carefully. Lab-RO: less biofouling; AHL degraded. Pretreatment loops to delay refouling. [ 85 96 Enzymatic CIP (lipase/protease) Protease/lipase blends (± surfactant) solubilize organics/EPS. Mature organic/EPS foulants on PA TFC membranes. Similarly to strong caustic; less refouling; keeps hydrophobicity. Cost/compatibility; recipe/time optimization. Multi-cycle RO effective; abattoir UF: ≈ 100% PWF; lipids/proteins ↓. Minimize caustic; sensitive PA. [ 50 97 98 Conventional chemical CIP (alkaline/acid) STPP/EDTA pH ≈ 12, 35 °C + 1% citric; optional oxidants. Mixed foulants (organics, biofilm, colloids, inorganics). Standard; broad efficacy. PA oxidation; higher chem/energy; sometimes worse than EPS-targeted bio-cleaners. CF042 PR 0.6873 vs. Ni1-LEM 0.7205; higher conductivity. Wastewater RO: NaOH–SDS → HCl; 35 °C/25 min; cross-flow 0.5 → 1.5 m·s −1 Routine CIP; mixed foulants; post-algal. [ 13 52 99 Pretreatment + non-oxidizing biocides (chemical) DAF/DMF + LAE, DBNPA, MIT (where allowed). Upstream biomass/TOC/AOC control; prevention. Lowers RO load; avoids PA oxidation. Regulatory/health; weak on mature biofilms. Full-scale DMF: low removal with frequent chlorination; LAE strong anti-biofilm (PA coupons). Integrated pretreatment; periodic dosing. [ 100 101 Chlorination (chemical, upstream) NaOCl upstream; dechlorinate before PA RO. Upstream bioburden control. Simple; common (CTA). PA oxidation risk; adaptation; may worsen biofouling; neutralize fully. Mixed; PA damage risk; CTA more tolerant. CTA; intake shock dosing with full dechlorination. [ 99 Biosurfactant cleaners (rhamnolipids) Lower surface tension; detach proteins/EPS; ↑ permeability. Mature (protein/EPS layer) and early stage (initial adhesion). Biodegradable; low-dose efficacy (~0.3 g·L −1 Cost/availability; foaming; limited RO data; verify PA compatibility. Whey UF: FR 100% @ 0.3 g·L −1 −1 −1 Gentle CIP; frequent/inter-cycle; co-cleaner alternative.
