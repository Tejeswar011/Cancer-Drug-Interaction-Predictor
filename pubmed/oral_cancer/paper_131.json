Summary Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have been proposed as caloric restriction mimetics with potential anti-aging effects. However, clinical data on their influence on aging biomarkers are limited. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 150 participants with type 2 diabetes are randomized (1:1) to receive oral henagliflozin (10 mg/day) or placebo for 26 weeks. Compared with placebo, henagliflozin significantly increases telomere length (primary endpoint), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels, and β-hydroxybutyrate levels and improves glucose metabolism. Immune analysis reveals that henagliflozin significantly increases granzyme B expression in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and tends to increase perforin expression in CTLs and perforin and granzyme B expression in total T lymphocytes. Metabolomic analysis shows that henagliflozin induces changes in various metabolites, including increased thiamine levels and enhanced thiamine metabolism. These findings suggest that henagliflozin may exert anti-aging effects through multiple pathways. This study is registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300068127).

According to the International Diabetes Federation, approximately 700 million people worldwide will be affected by T2DM by 2045, 1 2 , 3 3 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are an important class of anti-diabetic drugs that exert their glucose-lowering effects primarily by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of SGLT2i in treating age-related diseases, such as chronic kidney disease and heart failure. 11 , 12 , 13 14 15 Results Study participant demographics Between March 2023 and December 2023, a total of 426 participants were screened. 150 participants met the eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned.

Shortening of telomere length is indicative of DNA damage and is commonly recognized as a biomarker of aging. 17 17 , 18 19 In the current study, henagliflozin also demonstrated effects on other aging-related serum biomarkers. The GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in growth and development, and its suppression has been shown to extend lifespan and healthspan in model organisms. In humans, the IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio in blood circulation serves as a surrogate marker for GH/IGF-1 pathway activity. 20 21 22 16 23 , 24 25 26 27 28 , 29 30 Aging is also closely associated with chronic inflammation and a decline in immune function, 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Recent studies found that SGLT2i may exert anti-aging effects through multiple mechanisms, including the clearance of senescent cells to alleviate pathological aging, 14 39 40 , 41 42 10 43 44 45 Our results suggest that henagliflozin may exert anti-aging effects by influencing multiple pathways, including the IGF-1 system, glucose metabolism, the immune system, and serum metabolomics. Aging is often accompanied or exacerbated by pathological conditions such as frailty, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive decline, especially in patients with diabetes, which complicates disease management. Previous studies reported that SGLT2i significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure or in older patients with frailty and heart failure. 46 , 47 , 48 49 , 50 , 51 52 , 53 Limitations of the study There were several limitations in this study. First, while telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes is a widely used biomarker of aging and offers useful reference value, it may not be the most reliable or predictive marker of biological aging. Nevertheless, this study comprehensively assessed the effects of henagliflozin on aging from multiple aspects and provided important clinical insights into the role of SGLT2i in the aging process. Secondly, SGLT2i are considered CR mimetics, and the benefits of CR on healthspan have been documented. 5 Resource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Jixiong Xu ( jixiong.xu@ncu.edu.cn Materials availability This study did not generate new unique reagents.

T2DM patients were enrolled from March 2023. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to either the henagliflozin group (10 mg/day) or the placebo group. Inclusion criteria included aged 35–70 years; diagnosis of T2DM according to the World Health Organization criteria; no antihyperglycemic treatment for ≥12 weeks prior to screening; HbA1c levels between 7.0% and 9.5%; fasting C-peptide ≥1.0 ng/mL; FPG <13.3 mmol/L; BMI ≥22.0 kg/m 2 2 150 participants met the eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned. Eight patients withdrew informed consent for personal reasons. Ultimately, 142 patients were successfully enrolled. The mean age was 51.78 ± 9.37 years in the henagliflozin group and 51.67 ± 8.60 years in the placebo group, with males accounting for 46 (66.7%) and 51 (69.9%), respectively. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and at week 26, after fasting for at least 8 h. Samples were processed as plasma, serum, and whole blood. These samples were analyzed immediately after the blood drawing (for clinical chemistry, endocrinology and immunotyping) or stored at −80°C until the measurements (metabolomics, inflammation, IGF-1 system indicators and telomere length). Ethics statement The study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University (ethics approval number: IIT[2022] Clinical Ethical Review No. 102; date of vote: 2022-11-16) and complied with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry www.chictr.org.cn ChiCTR2300068127 Method details Randomization and blinding Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either henagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matched placebo ( Figure S3 Study visit schedule Patients attended a total of four clinical visits after the screening period (day −7 to day 0) ( Table S6 Table S6 Study treatment All enrolled patients received diabetes lifestyle guidance, including dietary control, regular exercise, blood glucose monitoring, regular medication, and healthy lifestyle habits. Study drugs (henagliflozin (10 mg) or matched placebo (1 tablet)) were initiated on the second day of the enrollment visit (visit 1). Staff conducted phone or clinic follow-ups during all subsequent visits to evaluate treatment adherence. At each clinic visit, assessments included vital signs, laboratory tests, and adverse event monitoring. All patients and staff involved in the trial remained blinded to treatment assignments. Open-label glimepiride rescue therapy was prescribed for patients above the following thresholds: FPG >14.99 mmol/L between weeks 0 and 4, >13.32 mmol/L between weeks 4 and 12, or >11.10 mmol/L between weeks 12 and 26, or HbA1c >8.0% between weeks 12 and 26. No other antidiabetic medications were permitted during the study, aside from henagliflozin and rescue therapy. Outcomes The primary endpoint was the change in telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes from baseline to week 26, measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). 54 Key secondary endpoints were changes in IGF-1 levels, IGFBP-3 levels, and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio. Other secondary endpoints included changes in HbA1c, FPG, islet function (homeostatic model assessment 2 estimates of β-cell function (HOMA2-β) and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR)), and serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels. Exploratory endpoints included changes in inflammatory marker levels, immune cell function, and serum metabolomics. Safety evaluation Safety parameters included adverse events, predefined adverse events of special interest (e.g., renal impairment, liver dysfunction, and DKA), and specific adverse events identified for this study (e.g., hypoglycemia, genital infection, urinary tract infection, and hypovolemia-related adverse events). Data management Once informed consent has been signed, physicians complete a paper-based case report forms (CRF) for each participant to document socio-demographic information, anthropometric measurements, vital signs, information about medical history, concomitant medication, and physical examination. Source documents comprise the CRF and hospital records as well as laboratory records. Researchers at each sub-center will send the enrolled patients' CRFs, clinical data, and informed consent forms to the main center (First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University), where all this data will be securely stored by the clinical professionals at the main center. The source data will be appropriately used for internal monitoring and potential external audits or inspections by regulatory authorities. Anthropometric measurements and medical history collection The height and weight of the participants were measured using an automated anthropometer, and BMI was calculated by dividing the weight (in kilograms) by the square of the height (in meters). Trained nurses measured blood pressure using a sphygmograph and refined waist and hip measurements, with the waist-to-hip ratio calculated from the waist/hip circumference. Body composition indicators were assessed using the direct segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance technique (Inbody-770, Seoul, Korea). The question on smoking status was “Do you currently smoke?” with options “Yes” and “No”. Questions about drinking status are “Do you frequently drink alcohol (beer, baijiu, etc.)?” with options “Yes” and “No”. Telomere length measurement Telomere length was measured using qPCR method, as previously described. 54 The master mix contained HotStart 2X Green qPCR Master Mix (K1070, APExBIO, USA), telomere primer pairs, 36B4 primer pairs, and nuclease-free water to complete the final volume. The primer pair tel1 and tel2 (final concentrations of 270 nM and 900 nM, respectively) were combined with the single copy genes 36B4u and 36B4d (final concentrations of 300 nM and 500 nM, respectively). The primer sequences (written 5′→3′) were as follows: tel1, GGTTTTTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGTGAGGGT; tel2, TCCCGACTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCCCTATCC-CTA; 36B4u, CAGCAAGTGGGAAGGTGTAATCC; 36B4d, CCCATTCTATCATCAACGGGTACAA. Experiments were conducted in a 96-well plate, and all samples were run in triplicate. We performed the following multiplex real-time quantitative PCR protocol in a LightCycler 96 Instrument Real-Time PCR system (Roche): 95°C for 2 min, one cycle; denatured at 95°C for 15 s annulled/extended at 60°C for 45 s, with fluorescence data collection, 40 cycles. Biochemical measurements Laboratory measurements were conducted by laboratory personnel blinded to the intervention. Fasting C-peptide was analyzed using the standard method, and HOMA2-β and HOMA2-IR were calculated using the HOMA-2 calculator based on FPG and fasting C-peptide. 55 56 Cytokine detection Interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (INF-γ) were detected by multiple microsphere flow immunofluorescence. After labeling the serum samples and corresponding flow cytometry tubes, add 25 μL of experimental buffer, 25 μL of serum, 25 μL of capture microsphere antibody, and 25 μL of detection antibody into the respective flow cytometry tubes. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h in darkness with gentle shaking, 25 μL of streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE) was added to the flow tubes and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. Subsequently, diluted wash buffer (1:10) was added. After a few seconds of vortex shaking, the flow tube was centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min. The liquid was slowly poured out, and the flow tube was inverted on absorbent paper. Then, 200 μL of diluted washing buffer (1:10) was added to the flow tube, which was shaken for 10 s, followed by detection using a flow cytometer (BECKMAN DxFLEX). The normal ranges of IL-10, IL-6, and IFN-γ are 0–12.9, 0–5.4, and 0–23.1 pg/mL, respectively. Natural killer (NK) cell subtypes and CTLs/NK cell cytotoxicity evaluation The detection method for NK cell subtypes is as follows: First, add 2 μL of each antibody (CD3-ECD, CD45-PE-cy7, CD56-PE, and CD16-APC) into a flow cytometry tube. Then, add 50 μL of EDTA-K2 anticoagulated whole blood to the bottom of the tube. Vortex to mix and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. Add 200 μL of lysing solution, vortex to mix, and incubate in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. Afterward, add 2 mL of physiological saline, centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and add 500 μL of physiological saline. Finally, perform the analysis using a flow cytometer (FACSLyric Flow Cytometer, BD Biosciences, USA). The fluorescence-labeled antibodies included in the CTLs/NK cell cytotoxicity assay kit (Raisecare, Qingdao, China) are CD45-PE-cy7, CD3-Percp, CD8-APC-cy7, CD16-APC, CD56-APC, Perforin-FITC, and Granzyme B-PE. The detection procedure for CTLs/NK cell cytotoxicity is as follows: First, take 50 μL of the patient's EDTA-K2 anticoagulated whole blood and add it to a flow cytometry tube. Then, add 5 μL of each surface antibody (CD45-PE-cy7, CD3-Percp, CD8-APC-cy7, CD16-APC, CD56-APC). Vortex to mix and incubate in the dark for 20 min. Next, add 450 μL of 1X lysing solution to the sample tube, vortex to mix, and incubate in the dark for 15 min. Afterward, centrifuge and discard the supernatant. Then, add 120 μL of fixative to the sample tube, vortex to mix, and incubate in the dark for 20 min. After incubation, add 300 μL of buffer to the sample tube, vortex to mix, and centrifuge again, discarding the supernatant. Add 2 mL of 1X permeabilization solution to the sample tube, vortex to mix, and incubate in the dark for 20 min, followed by centrifugation and discarding the supernatant. Finally, add 5 μL of granzyme B and perforin antibodies to the sample tube, vortex to mix, and incubate in the dark for 20 min. Subsequently, add 200 μL of buffer to the sample tube and perform the analysis using a flow cytometer (Raiselyte 2L6C, Raisecare, Qingdao, China). Due to the requirement for fresh whole blood for this measurement, which imposes high demands on the samples, and considering that our study is a multicenter study, only a subset of patients (19 in the henagliflozin group and 15 in the placebo group) underwent the test. Metabolite analysis by LC-MS/MS The sample were thawed slowly at 4°C, and the right sample (0.5–1.0 mL) were taken into the centrifuge tube, added 4 times the volume of the extraction solution (methanol/acetonitrile, 1:1, v/v), homogenized 60 s, extracted 30 min by low-temperature ultrasonic, set still for 1 h to precipitate protein at −20°C, centrifuged 10 min with 12000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant solution were dried in vacuum, added 0.1 mL 30% acetonitrile solution, homogenized and centrifuged 10 min with 12000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant were taken for computer detection. The sample were analyzed using an UPLC-Orbitrap-MS system (UPLC, Vanquish, MS, HFX). A Waters HSS T3 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.8μm) was used for chromatographic separation. The column temperature was set to 40°C, and the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. The injection volume was 2 μL. Solvent system, phase A were Milli-Q water (0.1% formic acid), phase B were acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid). The specifications of the gradient program were as follows: 0 min phase A/phase B (100:0, v/v), 1 min phase A/phase B (100:0, v/v), 12 min phase A/phase B (5:95, v/v), 13 min phase A/phase B (5:95, v/v), 13.1 min phase A/phase B (100:0, v/v), 17 min phase A/phase B (100:0, v/v). The mass spectrometric data were recorded on a Q Exactive HFX Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a heated ESI source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) utilizing the Full-ms-ddMS2 acquisition methods. The ESI source parameters were set as follows: sheath gas pressure, 40 arb; aux gas pressure, 10 arb; spray voltage, +3000 v/-2800 v; temperature, 350°C; and ion transport tube temperature, 320°C. The scanning range of the primary mass spectrometry was (scan m/z range) 70–1050 Da, with a primary resolution of 70000 and secondary resolution of 17500. Continuous glucose monitoring During the intervention period, 35 patients (19 in the henagliflozin group and 16 in the placebo group) who consented to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) used real-time CGM sensors (SIBIONICS, Shenzhen, China) to collect 72-h dynamic glucose monitoring parameters, including mean glucose (MG), standard deviation of glucose (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR), and time below range (TBR). On the clinical visit days of visit 1 and visit 4, a research staff member attached the sensor to the participant's triceps and secured it with a bandage. Participants were instructed to calibrate the CGM regularly using a glucometer, with a 15% deviation deemed acceptable. Quantification and statistical analysis Sample size The sample size calculation was based on the results of previous studies conducted at our hospital. We assumed that the mean difference in telomere length change from baseline was around 0.06 between the groups, with a standard error of 0.1. A total of 120 patients would provide 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 using a two-sample equal-variance t-test. Considering a drop-out rate of 20%, a sample size of 150 patients (75 per group) was planned for enrollment. Clinical data analysis Normality was assessed using histograms, Shapiro-Wilk tests, and QQ plots. Normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, non-normally distributed continuous variables as median (P 25 75 Tables 2 S2 S3 Figures 1 2 Table S1 All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Version 27.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) or SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc.).
