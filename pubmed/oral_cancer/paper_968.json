Introduction Orthodontic treatment dramatically improves the occlusion and quality of life of patients. However, orthodontic treatment can cause various environmental changes in the mouth, resulting in side effects, such as root resorption, temporomandibular disorders, and bacterial infectious diseases. During orthodontic treatment, the pH of the unstimulated saliva reportedly decreases [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Although restorative and prosthodontic treatments can help recover tooth form and function, they cannot alter caries risk factors such as saliva properties, oral microbiome, and lifestyle habits [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 11 14 15 16 14 15 17 While many studies have described changes after appliance placement, evidence that systematically classified pre-orthodontic patients using CAMBRA integrating clinical parameters for guiding preventive procedures before appliance placement remains limited. Our study aimed to classify pre-orthodontic patients using CAMBRA, and clarify their oral characteristics and microbiome for preliminary procedures. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethics Statement This study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee of Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan (No. E-2761). Informed consent was obtained from the participants’ parents or legal guardians as this study included individuals aged 18 years. All the methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. 2.2. Participants and Sample Size Estimation Among the patients who visited the Department of Orthodontics, Hiroshima University Hospital from July 2022 to January 2023, 68 patients (46 females, 22 males: median age was 14.2 years) who consented to participate in this study were included in this study ( Table 1 2.3. Grouping by CAMBRA and Sampling All participants underwent routine oral examinations, including oral photography, facial photography, and radiography (cephalometric and panoramic), and a study model was obtained at the beginning of orthodontic treatment at the initial visit. Clinical parameters, such as Plaque control record (PCR), decayed, missing, filled (DMF) index, and number of white spot lesions (WSLs), were obtained and oral hygiene instructions were provided [ 18 19 20 19 21 The participants were interviewed and scored according to their oral hygiene habits. Those who brushed their teeth properly after every meal were given a score of 1; those who always brushed their teeth before going to bed but not always on other occasions were given a score of 2; and those who sometimes went to bed without brushing their teeth were given a score of 3. Supragingival plaque and stimulated saliva samples were collected. Before sampling, the participants were instructed to refrain from eating, smoking, and tooth brushing for at least 2 h and avoid using a mouthwash. Approximately 4 mL of stimulated saliva samples were collected using tasteless gum containing Checkbuf (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) and divided for saliva testing and microbial analysis [ 22 5 23 2.4. Saliva Test The saliva secretion rate (mL/min) was calculated based on the total amount of stimulated saliva collected using a tasteless gum. Saliva pH was measured using a Checkbuf pH meter (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan), and the buffering capacity of the saliva was measured using the CAT21Buf risk test (Morita Co., Osaka, Japan) [ 24 Streptococcus mutans S. mutans Lactobacillus 5 6 6 7 7 22 25 Candida albicans 2.5. Bacterial 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Microbial DNA was extracted from the stimulated saliva and plaque samples using QuickGene-Mini 480 and Tissue DNA Kit S (KURABO, Kurashiki, Japan). The V3–V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene were amplified by amplicon polymerase chain reaction with the forward primer “TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG” and the reverse primer “GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC” (Hokkaido System Science Co., Hokkaido, Japan) [ 26 5 26 https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/search/entry/bioproject/PRJDB20162 2.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were conducted by QIIME2 and GraphPad PRISM version 10.6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). Continuous or ordinal outcomes are summarized as median. Differences among the risk groups were first assessed using the Kruskal–Wallis test (two-sided α = 0.05). When the omnibus Kruskal–Wallis test was significant, post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using Dunn’s test with multiplicity-adjusted p 3. Results 3.1. Power Estimation The sample size was calculated using G*power 3.1 software (Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany). One-way analysis of variance was performed for the four groups, with a total sample size of 68, effect size of 0.5, a significance level of 5%, and a calculated power of 0.934. 3.2. Subject Grouping by CAMBRA The participants were classified using CAMBRA ( Table 1 Figure 1 Figure 2 3.3. Oral Examinations The median number of DMF teeth was 0 in the Low- and Moderate groups, but was 2.0 in the High group and 9.0 in the extreme group ( Figure 3 p p adj p adj p adj p Figure 3 p adj Figure 3 p p adj p adj p adj Figure 3 In this study, we considered a visible white spot that did not require restoration to be a WSL [ 18 p p adj Figure 4 The plaque control record (PCR) was performed using a dental plaque-disclosing agent. The median PCR scores were 55%, 72%, 65%, and 59% in the Low, Moderate, High, and Extreme groups, respectively. However, no statistically significant difference was observed among all the risk groups upon multiple comparisons ( Figure 5 The results revealed that the Low and Extreme groups had the best and worst oral hygiene habits, respectively ( Figure 5 3.4. Saliva and Bacterial Culture Test The median salivary secretion volumes (mL/min) were 1.1, 0.5, 1.1 and 0.4 in the Low, Moderate, High and Extreme groups, respectively.

Discussion 4.1. Distribution by the Risk Groups and Oral Hygiene Status Doméjean et al. performed a retrospective study validating the CDA CAMBRA system in 2011 [ 16 16 Figure 2 However, when comparing the median age by risk category, no statistically significant differences were found, suggesting no influence of medication on hyposalivation with increased age ( Figure 1 22 Figure 5 Figure 5 27 28 29 4.2. Intraoral Conditions Our study comparing the number of DMF teeth and WSLs by risk groups revealed that all items scored 0 points in the Low/Moderate groups, whereas all the items except the number of missing teeth were positive in the High/Extreme groups. In the CAMBRA system, the presence of any disease indicators (1; Visible cavities or radiographic penetration of the dentin, 2; Radiographic approximal enamel lesions (not in dentin), 3; White spots on smooth surfaces, 4; Restorations last 3 years) automatically indicates high/extreme [ 21 30 Figure 3 30 4.3. Salivary Properties and Bacterial Culture Test Saliva plays a crucial role in the oral environment. Saliva affects the incidence of dental caries by buffering and neutralizing the acids produced by cariogenic bacteria [ 31 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 22 32 Streptococcus mutans Lactobacillus Candida albicans Streptococcus mutans streptococcus mutans Figure 7 Streptococcus mutans Lactobacillus 33 Streptococcus mutans 34 35 36 Streptococcus mutans Streptococcus mutans Lactobacillus 37 4.4. Microbiome of Saliva and Plaque The human mouth harbors more than 700 bacterial species, constituting one of the most diverse bacterial communities in the body [ 5 38 39 40 With the widespread use of next-generation sequencing, research on oral microbiota has become more common; however, there have been no reports on differences in the oral microbiota according to the CAMBRA classification, especially in populations starting orthodontic treatment. In this study, based on the results of metagenomic analysis, we compared the relative abundance ratios of bacteria that may cause pathology in the human body according to the risk groups. The microbiome varied between the saliva and plaque samples, which is consistent with the results of previous reports [ 5 39 40 41 Actinomyces 42 43 44 Streptococcus mutans Figure 7 Actinomyces 45 46 Fusobacterium 44 47 48 Fusobacterium Fusobacterium 49 Actinomyces Actinomyces 45 50 Although 16S rRNA profiling did not exhibit the highest relative abundance of the genus Streptococcus Figure 10 Streptococcus mutans Figure 7 S. mutans. Actinomyces Alpha and beta diversity did not differ globally between the CAMBRA risk groups, yet niche-linked taxa did: Actinomyces Fusobacterium S. mutans 4.5. Limitations The limitation of this study is that the number of participants varied based on the risk classification, which made comparison between the groups challenging. In addition, this was a single-center, cross-sectional cohort of Japanese pre-orthodontic patients, which limits external validity to other age groups, ethnicities, as well as to populations not seeking orthodontic care and to patients undergoing active orthodontic treatment. Furthermore, metagenomic sequencing did not involve full-length 16S rRNA analysis, but instead focused on the V3-V4 region, meaning that the bacteria could not be identified at the species level. 5. Conclusions In this study, CAMBRA risk classification accurately reflects the oral condition of pre-orthodontic patients. CAMBRA can be considered an effective screening method at the start of treatment. In particular, special consideration is warranted in all aspects such as oral hygiene habits, number of cariogenic bacteria, and saliva buffering capacity for the Extreme group.
