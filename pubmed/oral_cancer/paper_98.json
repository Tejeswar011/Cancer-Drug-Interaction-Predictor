Current evidence supports radical surgical resection as the primary treatment modality, yet it is associated with prohibitively high postoperative recurrence rates. We report the clinical course of a 66-year-old male diagnosed with SHC. A hepatic mass (4.1 × 2.7 × 4.4 cm) was incidentally detected during routine health screening. The patient underwent laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy, with histopathological confirmation of SHC. Superior mesenteric lymphadenopathy suspicious for metastasis developed 1 month postoperatively. Prophylactic transarterial chemoembolization was initiated, followed by 6-month tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, achieving disease stabilization. However, lymph nodes progression occurred after TKI discontinuation, confirming metastatic involvement. Subsequent combined therapy (a TKI and an anti-PD-1 antibody) was administered. Notably, the patient self-discontinued treatment after two cycles, yet subsequent imaging revealed complete resolution of metastatic lymphadenopathy. No additional antitumor therapy has been administered, and the patient remains recurrence-free with 18-month overall survival confirmed by recent radiographic surveillance. sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma TKI anti-PD-1 antibody liver tumor targeted-immunotherapy The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

One week prior to admission, the patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound during a routine physical examination, which revealed a mass in the right posterior lobe of the liver. Further contrast-enhanced CT of the upper abdomen indicated imaging features consistent with a malignant liver tumor, measuring 4.1 cm × 2.7 cm × 4.4 cm (  Figure 1 9  Supplementary Figure 1 Figure 1 CT Findings: (A) (B) (C) (D) CT scan images labeled A to D show cross-sectional views of the abdomen, including organs such as the liver, stomach, and spine. The series displays variations in density and tissue contrast, highlighting different anatomical structures in each frame. The patient underwent laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy of the liver one week after admission, followed by pathological examination. Integrated with morphological and immunohistochemical findings, the pathological diagnosis was consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma with extensive sarcomatoid transformation (70% sarcomatoid component). Key features included: Edmondson-Steiner grade IV differentiation; histologic subtypes comprising macrotrabecular-massive and solid patterns with spindle cell sarcomatoid morphology; prominent stromal lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis; evident tumor necrosis; presence of vascular and microvascular invasion; no definite perineural invasion or satellite nodules; and negative surgical margins. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a biphasic immunophenotype. The conventional HCC component exhibited positivity for HepPar-1, CK8/18, and focal CK7, while demonstrating loss of AE1/AE3. The sarcomatoid component showed weak and focal expression of AE1/AE3, CK8/18, and CK19, strong diffuse vimentin positivity, and complete absence of hepatocytic markers (HepPar-1). CD34 highlighted microvascular density. The high proliferative index (Ki-67 ≈80%) correlated with the aggressive histology. Negative staining for Melan-A, HMB45, S-100, Syn, CD117, CD10, and Desmin excluded melanoma, neuroendocrine, and mesenchymal differentials. This immunophenotypic profile conclusively supports SHC with bidirectional differentiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and high-grade malignancy. (  Figure 2 Figure 2  (A) (B) (D) (C) Histological image panel showing four sections labeled A to D. Section A is stained in pink and purple, showing dense tissue structures. Section B appears lighter with more dispersed staining. Section C shows a mix of lighter and darker brown areas, indicating varied tissue distribution. Section D exhibits a predominantly brown-stained area with more distinct structures. Postoperative follow-up and treatment Given the patient’s high-risk factors for recurrence, prophylactic transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was recommended to be performed approximately one month postoperatively after physical recovery. However, this recommendation was extrapolated from treatment guidelines established for conventional HCC rather than evidence specific to SHC ( 4 5  Figure 3A  Figure 3B, C Figure 3  (A) (B, C) (D) CT scans of the abdomen in four panels labeled A to D. Each panel shows cross-sectional views with arrows indicating a particular area of interest near the central abdominal region, possibly highlighting abnormalities or features for medical analysis. A repeat contrast-enhanced CT scan performed one-month after discontinuation of lenvatinib revealed no new lesions elsewhere but demonstrated significant re-enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Combined with clinical history, this confirmed lymph node metastasis (  Figure 3D Subsequent follow-up The patient returned for follow-up 45 days after discontinuation of the medication. A contrast-enhanced abdominal MRI revealed complete resolution of the previously enlarged SMLNs (  Figure 4A  Figure 4B  Figure 4C  Supplementary Figure 2 Figure 4 Follow-up CEMRI scans reveal complete resolution of previously enlarged lymph nodes, with images (A) (B) (C) Three-panel MRI images labeled A, B, and C display the abdomen, highlighting a specific area with arrows. Each image shows a transverse view of abdominal organs and vascular structures. Discussion SHC, a prognostically unfavorable subtype of HCC, exhibits aggressive clinicopathological features including high metastatic potential and frequent recurrence. Its low incidence has resulted in limited large-scale studies. Sih-Han Liao et al. ( 6 3 7 Previous studies ( 6 8 Regarding the imaging manifestations of SHC, a study by He et al. ( 9 6 10 9 Emerging evidence offers cautious optimism. Recent reports ( 2 11 13 2 7 14 16 17 19 Our management of this case highlights several limitations and areas for further discussion. First, the diagnosis of SMLN metastasis relied solely on imaging findings without histopathological confirmation via biopsy or metabolic verification through PET-CT. Second, retrospective review of preoperative contrast-enhanced CT images revealed preexisting suspicious enlargement of SMLNs, indicating suboptimal preoperative staging that may have impacted clinical decision-making. Lastly, although prophylactic TACE was administered postoperatively, we cannot provide definitive evidence regarding its efficacy in preventing recurrence in SHC. Conclusion In conclusion, SHC represents a highly aggressive malignant tumor with poor prognosis. Current research findings consistently demonstrate that radical surgical resection remains the primary treatment option, yet the overall survival outcomes remain suboptimal. Notably, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anti-PD-1 antibodies have exhibited significant therapeutic benefits in selected case reports, including the case study we reported. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation through rigorously designed clinical trials and may provide guidance for future therapeutic decision-making. However, large-scale multicenter studies with robust methodological quality are still required to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of various treatment modalities and establish evidence-based clinical guidelines.

Internally, it contains patchy T2-hyperintense areas with relatively regular morphology and well-defined margins, without capsular retraction or biliary dilation (D/E). Post-contrast images show arterial phase hyperenhancement with non-enhancing areas, venous phase peripheral washout with internal nodular enhancement, and persistent nodular enhancement during the delayed phase, reflecting “fast-in and slow-out” kinetics at the periphery and progressive enhancement internally (F–H).
