Knowledge generated: Recent advancements include next-generation immune-modulating agents, adoptive cell therapies, and EBV-targeted therapeutic vaccines. Antibody–drug conjugates and molecularly targeted agents are under investigation to enhance precision and overcome treatment resistance. Relevance: Emerging novel therapies have the potential to improve clinical outcomes in advanced NPC by targeting unique biology and addressing therapeutic resistance, thereby offering new options for patients who have limited standard treatment options. Abstract Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare malignancy with a distinct epidemiological pattern and is most often associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). EBV plays a critical role in NPC pathogenesis, with viral proteins driving oncogenesis by altering immune regulation, apoptosis, and tumor progression. The unique molecular landscape of NPC presents both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic development, particularly in the recurrent and metastatic (R/M) setting, where treatment resistance remains a major hurdle. While platinum-based chemotherapy has traditionally been the standard of care for R/M NPC, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a key component of treatment. However, both intrinsic and acquired resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade underscore the need for alternative strategies, including modulation of alternative immune checkpoints and simultaneous engagement of non-redundant pathways to enhance responses and durability. Leveraging EBV-driven biology, emerging immunotherapeutic approaches, such as EBV-specific adoptive cellular therapies and therapeutic vaccines, aim to induce durable immunity to viral proteins. Additionally, targeted therapies including receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, epigenetic modulators, and antibody–drug conjugates are redefining precision medicine by selectively delivering cytotoxic agents to tumors. With growing insights into the biology of NPC and evolving therapeutics, the integration of immunotherapy, targeted agents, and biomarker-driven strategies is poised to transform NPC treatment, emphasizing biology-driven, multimodal approaches to optimize patient outcomes. nasopharyngeal carcinoma immunotherapy therapeutic vaccine adaptive cell therapy This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy arising from the nasopharyngeal epithelium, characterized by distinct epidemiologic patterns based on geography, sex, and histologic subtype. Although globally rare (~1 case per 100,000 annually), its incidence is markedly elevated in endemic regions such as Southern China and Southeast Asia compared to Western populations [ 1 2 3 4 1.1. Cancer Biology EBV infection is a key etiologic factor in NPC, particularly in endemic regions [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 In addition to viral proteins, EBV expresses noncoding RNAs, further driving NPC progression. EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBER1 and EBER2) exhibit dual roles: they activate pattern recognition receptors (TLR3, RIG-I) to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines but also inhibit apoptosis, with context-dependent effects on tumorigenesis [ 7 11 12 13 Moreover, host genetic and epigenetic alterations shape disease susceptibility and progression. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified risk loci within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and other immune-related genes, implicating inherited predisposition [ 14 15 16 17 18 While EBV-positive NPC dominates in endemic areas, EBV-negative NPC, more prevalent in non-endemic regions, is often linked to environmental factors like smoking and HPV infection. EBV-negative tumors exhibit distinct genomic profiles, including higher rates of TP53 mutations and lower immune infiltration [ 3 Beyond traditional views of NPC centered on somatic mutations and gene alterations as primary drivers, recent paradigms challenge this view, proposing cancer as a complex ecological and evolutionary system [ 19 20 1.2. Staging and Prognosis The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system has recently introduced key revisions in the ninth edition to improve disease classification and prognosis. A key update is the reclassification of radiologically defined nonmetastatic disease into stages I to III, defined as follows: Stage I includes T1–2N0–1, Stage II comprises T3 or N2 disease, and Stage III encompasses T4 or N3 disease. Metastatic disease is now designated as Stage IV, with further subdivisions into IVA (M1a, ≤3 metastatic lesions) and IVB (M1b, >3 lesions). Extranodal extension into adjacent structures (e.g., muscle, skin, or neurovascular bundles) is now recognized as an adverse prognostic feature under the N3 category [ 21 22 23 NPC prognosis is highly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, with early-stage disease having a five-year survival rate exceeding 90%, while advanced stages are associated with significantly worse outcomes [ 24 25 26 27 1.3. Current Standard Therapy NPC is predominantly managed with non-surgical, radiation-intensive strategies. For early-stage disease (Stages I–II), definitive radiation therapy remains the standard of care, with prophylactic nodal irradiation. For Stage II, the addition of concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin enhances treatment efficacy. Locally advanced disease (Stages III and IVA) requires a more aggressive approach, with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation [ 28 For recurrent or metastatic (R/M) NPC, treatment options remain limited, and the prognosis is poor. In carefully selected cases, endoscopic nasopharyngectomy may be a salvage option for locally recurrent NPC limited to the nasopharynx and adjacent superficial structures after multidisciplinary assessment [ 29 30 31 Advances in tumor immunobiology and drug development are reshaping the therapeutic landscape of R/M NPC. Emerging strategies, such as next-generation immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapies, bispecific antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), and molecularly targeted agents, seek to improve tumor selectivity, modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and overcome therapeutic resistance. Collectively, these modalities represent a rapidly evolving frontier in the management of R/M NPC. 2. Novel Therapeutics in NPC 2.1. Immune Cell-Activating Agents EBV-associated NPC is characterized by chronic antigenic stimulation from viral proteins (e.g., LMP1, EBNA1), which contributes to the development of a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This immunosuppression is driven by the accumulation of immunoregulatory cell populations, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tolerogenic macrophages, all of which inhibit effector T cell function and impair anti-tumor immunity [ 32 Figure 1 Table 1 2.1.1. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitors Chronic exposure to EBV antigens leads to sustained PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and upregulated programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor and stromal cells, particularly in nonkeratinizing subtypes of NPC. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1, including toripalimab, tislelizumab, penpulimab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab, are currently used to treat advanced NPC, either in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy or as monotherapy following platinum-based chemotherapy [ 31 33 34 Beyond PD-1/PD-L1 Despite their clinical approval, PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors demonstrate only modest efficacy in NPC, with objective response rates of approximately 15–20% [ 35 36 To address these resistance mechanisms, several early-phase combination strategies are investigating dual checkpoint blockade strategies. IBI310, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody that competes with CD28 for B7 ligands and inhibits early T-cell activation, is being evaluated in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor sintilimab in patients with advanced solid tumors [ 37 n n 38 NCT06029270 39 40 Bispecific Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Bispecific immune checkpoint inhibitors are being developed to enhance antitumor immunity by simultaneously targeting multiple immune regulatory pathways. One promising approach involves dual blockade of PD-L1 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). TGF-β is a cytokine frequently overexpressed in NPC, which contributes to immune evasion by promoting Treg differentiation and suppressing cytotoxic T cell function [ 41 42 42 Other PD-L1 and TGF-β dual-targeting agents, such as SHR-1701 and TQB2858, are currently under clinical evaluation, with early-phase studies indicating potential antitumor activity in NPC. Cadonilimab, a bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, has shown clinical activity with an ORR of 68% when combined with chemotherapy, which is similar to the standard anti-PD-1-platinum chemo combination, in patients with PD-1-refractory R/M NPC [ 43 44 45 46 2.1.2. T Cell Co-Stimulatory Pathways In contrast to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which suppress inhibitory signaling in effector T cells, co-stimulatory receptor agonists aim to deliver activating signals that amplify T cell responses. These agents target receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, such as OX40 (CD134) and 4-1BB (CD137), which are predominantly expressed following T cell activation [ 47 48 49 50 51 2.1.3. Other Immune Modulating Agents Metabolic dysregulation within the TME of NPC promotes immune evasion by creating an immunosuppressive milieu dominated by lactate accumulation, adenosine signaling, and lipid metabolic rewiring, presenting actionable targets for immunomodulatory agents [ 52 53 54 55 56 57 2.2. Therapeutic Vaccine Therapeutic vaccination represents a promising strategy for NPC given its strong etiologic link to EBV. Unlike rapidly mutating tumor antigens, EBV latency proteins remain genetically stable and consistently expressed, enabling robust epitope-specific vaccine design. Multiple vaccine modalities are currently under investigation in both clinical and preclinical settings ( Figure 1 Table 1 Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines involve ex vivo loading of autologous DCs with EBV peptides (e.g., LMP2), followed by reinfusion to enhance antigen-specific immunity [ 58 + + 59 60 61 Peptide vaccines targeting LMP2 epitopes elicit detectable CD8 + 62 63 + 64 The viral antigenic stability and restricted expression of EBV latency proteins in nonkeratinizing NPC make them ideal targets for vaccination [ 65 66 67 2.3. Adoptive Cell Therapy Recent advances in T-cell engineering have broadened the scope of cancer immunotherapy beyond checkpoint inhibition and vaccination. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), which involves the transfer of ex vivo expanded or genetically modified T cells, enables direct augmentation of antitumor immunity. Unlike vaccine-based approaches that depend on endogenous priming, ACT provides immediate delivery of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells [ 68 Figure 1 Table 1 EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs) were among the earliest forms of ACT explored in NPC [ 69 70 71 72 To overcome these limitations, allogeneic EBV-CTLs derived from healthy donors have been developed as scalable, off-the-shelf alternatives that circumvent prior therapy–induced immunosuppression [ 73 74 While the adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), harvested from the tumor, has demonstrated feasibility when administered with IL-2 following chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced NPC, the contribution of TILs to the overall clinical activity is difficult to determine [ 75 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy represents a next-generation ACT platform, enabling MHC-independent recognition of tumor-associated surface antigens [ 76 77 T-cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells leverage native MHC-restricted antigen recognition to target intracellular EBV antigens in NPC. Unlike CAR-T cells, which primarily engage surface proteins in an MHC-independent manner, TCR-T cells can detect low-abundance intracellular peptides with high specificity and affinity [ 78 79 Beyond traditional ACT modalities, novel strategies are being tested, including polyclonal autologous T cell expansions, which aim to generate broad immune responses, γδ T cell-based therapy, which recognizes stress ligands independently of MHC, making them suitable for tumors with impaired antigen presentation. The clinical testing of such strategies is still in an early stage, and the safety and efficacy have not yet been verified. 2.4. Antibody–Drug Conjugates Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a novel class of therapeutics that integrate the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic potency of chemotherapeutic agents. Their modular design enables the targeted delivery of potent cytotoxins to tumor cells expressing specific surface antigens, thereby minimizing systemic toxicity [ 80 81 Figure 1 Table 1 EGFR is overexpressed in a substantial proportion of NPC tumors and contributes to proliferation, metastasis, and treatment resistance via the activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways [ 82 83 84 CD70 is a member of the TNF ligand family and contributes to immune evasion in NPC by engaging CD27 on T cells [ 85 86 CD276 (B7-H3) is another immune checkpoint molecule overexpressed in various solid tumors. It modulates immune cell infiltration and promotes macrophage-mediated T cell suppression. The ADC YL201 is designed to engage CD276, employing a tumor-microenvironment-responsive linker to release its cytotoxic payload. This design enables selective cytotoxicity within the immunosuppressive TME, potentially reversing immune exclusion and enhancing anti-tumor immunity [ 87 n 87 To overcome limitations associated with single-antigen targeting, bispecific ADCs have been developed as a next-generation strategy to improve therapeutic precision and address antigen heterogeneity. For instance, BL-B01D1 simultaneously targets EGFR and HER3 and facilitates improved internalization efficiency [ 88 89 n 89 2.5. Targeted Therapies 2.5.1. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Targeted therapies in NPC aim to disrupt key oncogenic pathways that regulate tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance ( Figure 1 Table 1 90 Therapeutically, RTKs can be inhibited using monoclonal antibodies that block extracellular ligand binding or small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that interfere with intracellular ATP-binding sites. For example, the addition of nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR antibody, to standard chemoradiation in locally advanced NPC demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and promising efficacy in multiple studies [ 91 92 VEGF, which plays a central role in tumor angiogenesis, has also been recognized as an important immune modulator in various solid tumors [ 93 94 95 2.5.2. Other Targets CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as dalpiciclib, not only suppress tumor proliferation through G1-phase arrest but also enhance tumor immunogenicity by upregulating MHC class I and interferon signaling, supporting their use in combination with immunotherapy [ 96 97 98 Epigenetic therapies targeting EBV latency offer novel therapeutic opportunities. Nanatinostat reactivates EBV lytic genes, enabling valganciclovir to be phosphorylated into a cytotoxic form that selectively kills infected tumor cells [ 99 100 101 102 103 3. Summary and Outlook Despite recent advancements, treatment options for advanced NPC remain limited. A primary challenge is the lack of clearly defined driver mutations that can be targeted with precision medicine [ 104 105 106 107 However, the treatment landscape is evolving as drug development enters a new era, characterized by the introduction of diverse therapeutic modalities in oncology. ICIs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown promising efficacy in recurrent or metastatic disease [ 108 109 A critical consideration in future therapeutic development is the biological distinction between EBV-associated NPC, which predominates in endemic regions, and non-EBV NPC, more commonly observed in Western populations [ 110 111 112 Additionally, an emerging body of work frames NPC as a dynamic ecosystem shaped by ecological and evolutionary processes [ 19 20 113 Despite these challenges, advancements in our understanding of the molecular and immunological landscape of the disease, combined with the development of novel therapies and biomarker-guided treatment strategies, hold the potential to significantly improve outcomes for patients with advanced NPC.
