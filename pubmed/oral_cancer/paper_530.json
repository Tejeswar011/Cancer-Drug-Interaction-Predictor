It is caused by mutations of TSC1 TSC2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 The prevalence of TSC is estimated to be approximately 1 in 6,000 to 10,000 individuals in the general population. Yet, no particular prevalence studies concerning TSC in Saudi Arabia exist. Individuals of any race and ethnicity can be affected by TSC. It occurs at equal frequency among males and females [ 8 8 9 10 11 TSC, like some other neurocutaneous conditions (such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)), possesses features that help guide clinicians toward an accurate diagnosis [ 12 13 14 15 de novo 16 17 TSC2 TSC1 18 19 After reviewing gene databases, we can say this is the first reported case in which a novel heterozygous mutation has been identified at the flanking splice site of exon 37 in the TSC2 20 21 Case Report A 2-year-5-month-old female came to the emergency department with a 5-day history of generalized abnormal body movements and up-rolling of both eyes. The frequency of attacks was five to six times per day. Each attack lasted for approximately 10 s. The attacks were associated with decreased feeding and activity with no history of fever. She experienced her first episode of seizure at the age of 1 month, and she was on phenobarbital as anti-epileptic medication. The patient has a positive family history of tuberous sclerosis (TS) from her mother side. Upon physical examination, multiple hypopigmented patches (ash leaf) over her right leg, chest, abdomen, and left arm were noted. There were no other significant findings. In terms of her investigations, a hematological workup was done, and test results indicated hemoglobin of 141g/L, hematocrit of 40%, and low mean platelet volume (MPV) of 7.3 fL. She also had leukocytosis with lymphocyte predominance. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed active discharges with polyspike waves on a suppression background along with bilateral sharp waves. There were no abnormalities detected on the echocardiogram. A gene panel for TS was conducted and revealed a heterozygous mutation in the flanking splice site of exon 37 of TSC2 Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reported multiple subependymal nodules, with a mild subtle increase in the enhancement of the lesion on the left centrum semiovale ( Fig. 1a-c Figure 1 (a, b, c) Brain MRI reported multiple subependymal nodules, with a mild subtle increase in the enhancement of the lesion on the left centrum semiovale. MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. Kidney MRI showed multiple innumerable renal cysts, the largest measured 0.8 cm. There is a well-defined round cortical lesion that is noted at the interpolar region of the right kidney. It appears as isointense in comparison to the renal cortex at T1- and T2-weighted images. Radiology suggested that the described right interpolar lesion is worrisome for renal cell carcinoma. Other possibilities of the nature of this lesion may include lipid-poor angiomyolipoma or oncocytoma ( Fig. 2a, b Figure 2 (a, b) Kidney MRI shows multiple innumerable renal cysts, the largest measuring 0.8 cm. A well-defined round cortical lesion is noted in the interpolar region of the right kidney, which is concerning for renal cell carcinoma. MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. Computed tomography (CT) chest scan with intravenous (IV) contrast revealed a small irregular area of ground-glass density within the left lower lobe. As well, the visualized part of the upper abdomen demonstrated a partial clear view of a hypodense right renal lesion. The patient was referred to oncology due to suspicion of renal cell carcinoma. The tumor board discussed her condition, and a partial nephrectomy was decided. She underwent wedge resection of the right kidney on January 6, 2025. The histopathological examination of the biopsied specimen reported a grade II renal cell carcinoma. There are no sarcomatoid, rhabdoid features, nor tumor necrosis, and no lymphatic or vascular invasion. On gross examination, the specimen consisted of multiple fragments of brown-tan renal tissue (4 × 2.1 × 1.3 cm) aggregates and a separate white-tan nodule (1.7 × 1.5 × 1.3 cm). Sectioning of the renal tissue reveals homogenous brown-tan cut surface with foci of hemorrhage. Sectioning of the nodule reveals a homogenous white-tan cut surface. The oncology team met and discussed the case. Since the tumor resection margins were negative and there was no metastasis, and based on the most recent evidence, it was decided that no chemotherapy was needed. However, further management included follow-up with ultrasound every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years. The patient has a history of recurrent emergency room (ER) visits with fevers, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms, and seizure attacks, especially when non-compliance to anti-convulsant medications. She is now regularly following up with neurology, ophthalmology, and nephrology. She is on topiramate and valproate as anti-convulsant medications. Discussion TS is a rare genetic disease inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern that affects multiple organs in the body. TSC results from mutations in the TSC1 TSC2 22 23 The incidence of the disease is estimated to be approximately 1 in 6,000 to 10,000 in the general population, with no sex or ethnicity predominance. About two-thirds of the cases are sporadic and show no family history [ 8 TSC2 TSC1 TSC2 TSC1 TSC2 8 24 TSC2 While most cases are observed with no family history, this case presents with a positive family history. A 2011 Boston cohort study of 278 patients found that TSC1 TSC2 25 TSC2 TS can affect multiple organs, including brain, skin, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The clinical manifestations are categorized into neurological and non-neurological features. Neurological impairment is the primary source of mortality and morbidity [ 24 22 26 Diagnosis of TSC can be challenging. There are no single or specific pathognomonic characteristics found in all patients [ 25 8 25 TSC1 TSC2 27 Table 1 28 TSC2 de novo Table 1 The Clinical Criteria for the Diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Minor criteria Major criteria Genetic diagnosis 1. “Confetti” skin lesions 1.

Renal angiomyolipomas (≥ 2) Treatment for TS requires a multidisciplinary approach with regular follow-up [ 29 29 30 29 31 29 We are reviewing 12 cases of TSC, ranging in age from 1 month old to 31-year ( Table 2 23 32 37 32 33 33 23 Table 2 Summary of 12 Cases of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) Study Age at presentation Presenting features [ 32 17 months Seizure [ 33 6 months Seizure [ 33 3 months Seizure [ 23 3 months Seizure, delays in speech, cognitive abilities, and social development [ 23 4 months Seizure [ 34 32 years Unilateral angiofibroma and hypopigmented patch [ 35 9 years Unilateral facial angiofibroma [ 36 1 month Erythema and nodules in the face, neck, and oral cavity, several grain-sized hypopigmentation spots on her back [ 37 7 years Facial angiofibroma, hypomelanotic macule on trunk, shagreen patch, and tonic clonic convulsion [ 37 3 years Facial angiofibroma, poliosis (hypomelanosis of hair), and hypomelanotic patches [ 37 7 years Hypomelanotic patches in face, trunk and limbs [ 37 11 months Hypomelanotic patch in trunk multiple and focal seizure Seizure is not always the first presenting complaint in some patients. Aboud et al reported a unique presentation of a 32-year-old patient with multiple unilateral asymptomatic skin-colored papules on the back of the neck, associated with a hypopigmented patch with no other features [ 34 35 35 36 37 Conclusions Herein, the first case of a new heterozygous mutation located at the flanking splice site of exon 37 of the TSC2 Learning points This study highlights several important aspects of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of TSC.
