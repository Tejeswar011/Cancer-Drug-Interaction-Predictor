Recent studies involving Psilocybe\ncubensis Staphylococcus\naureus P. cubensis Psilocybin, psychedelic compound naturally\nfound in hallucinogenic\nmushrooms, acts as a prodrug that is metabolized into psilocin upon\noral administration, thereby exerting its psychoactive effects.   The therapeutic use of psilocybin and psilocin has driven\nsignificant\nresearch efforts aimed at elucidating their mechanisms of action,\nas well as their physicochemical and biological characteristics, with\na focus on improving treatment outcomes through optimized formulation\nstrategies.  Psilocybe Materials and Methods Reagents and Standards The Psilocybe\ncubensis Experimental Procedure Extraction of Psilocybin and Psilocin Initially, the\ndried mushrooms were ground to initiate the extraction process. The\ndried material was placed in a mortar and submerged in liquid nitrogen.\nAfter freezing, the material was pulverized via a pestle until a homogeneous\npowder was obtained. The resulting powder was then sieved through\na 170 mesh (0.088 mm) sieve. The particles retained on the sieve were\ncollected, ground in a mortar, and sieved again until the entire sample\nreached the desired particle size (<0.088 mm). The extraction\nprocess was carried out via a method adapted from Morita et al. Characterization Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray\nSpectroscopy (EDS) Mushroom powder samples were morphologically\ncharacterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with TM 1000 HITACHI\nand PHENOM PROX microscopes. The morphology of the mushroom tissues\nand pulverized particles was examined at four magnifications (50×,\n250×, 1000×, and 2000×), without the need for a gold\ncoating due to the low-voltage operation of the equipment. Chemical\ncharacterization was performed through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy\n(EDS), an essential accessory for identifying the elemental composition\nof the samples. The analysis of the dried and ground mushroom samples\nfocused on the predominant element and phosphorus contents, with the\naim of confirming the presence of psilocybin. Elemental mapping and\nspectra were obtained at 2000× magnification. X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis\nwas performed via a Malvern Panalytical Epsilon 4 spectrometer capable\nof detecting elements ranging from carbon (C) to americium (Am) at\nconcentrations ranging from sub ppm levels up to 100% by weight. This\ntechnique was applied to mushroom powder samples to determine their\nelemental composition. The methodology included sample preparation,\ninstrument calibration, X-ray irradiation and detection, spectral\nanalysis, and quality control. The results contributed to meeting\nquality standards, identifying potential impurities, and optimizing\nthe production process. Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (STA) Coupled with FTIR Spectroscopy Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry\n(DSC) were performed to determine the thermal characteristics of the\nsamples. A simultaneous TGA/DSC analyzer (PerkinElmer STA-6000) was\nused under a nitrogen atmosphere (40 mL/min), heating both the ground\nmushroom samples and the API from 20 to 900 °C at a rate of 10\n°C/min. To investigate the decomposition mechanism, the analyzer\nwas coupled to a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (PerkinElmer\nSpectrum 400). The evolved gases were transferred through a heated\ntransfer line (TL 8000) into a gas cell maintained at 270 °C\nto prevent condensation. The FTIR spectra of the evolved gases were\nrecorded via Spectrum Time Base software in the spectral range of\n4000–650 cm –1 –1 Phytochemical Analysis Phytochemical analyses were\nperformed on both the mushroom sample and its extract, following the\nmethodology widely cited in the literature, as described by Matos. 3 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) The\ndried mushroom samples, as well as their macerated forms and extracts,\nwere analyzed via FTIR spectroscopy to identify their components and\ncharacteristic vibrational bands. Spectra were acquired in the range\nof 4000–650 cm –1 –1 Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) The assay aimed to determine metal contamination in psilocybin\npowder and extract samples, classifying it as a trace element analysis.\nFor this purpose, an Optima 8000 inductively coupled plasma optical\nemission spectrometer (ICP-OES) from PerkinElmer equipped with an\naxial torch, a nebulizer with a Scott spray chamber, and a charge-coupled\ndevice (CCD)-based detection system was used, ensuring the accuracy\nof the analytical calibration curves. Analyses were conducted in accordance\nwith the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and ICH Q3D guidelines,\nadhering to the maximum allowable limits for heavy metals specified\nin USP ⟨232> and ⟨233⟩.  Microbiological Profile Analysis Microbiological analysis\nwas performed to detect the presence of aerobic microorganisms, molds,\nand yeasts. The method employed was the pour plate technique, in which\na 1:10 (sample/sterile water) suspension is prepared and serial dilutions\nranging from 1/10 to 1/10,000 are conducted. For the enumeration of\naerobic microorganisms, 1000 μL of each dilution was transferred\ninto Petri dishes, followed by the addition of 15 mL of casein soy\nagar (CSA) melted and maintained at 50 °C. The plates were incubated\nin an inverted position at 35 °C for 3 days. For molds and yeasts,\nSabouraud dextrose agar was used, and the plates were incubated at\n22 °C for five to 7 days. After the incubation period, the number\nof colony-forming units (CFUs) was counted and recorded. Cytotoxicity The assay was based on ISO 10993-5:2009\nand was used to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of medical devices.\nThe L929 fibroblast line (ATCC NCTC clone 929), obtained from the\nRio de Janeiro Cell Bank, Brazil, was used in the test. The colorimetric\ncytotoxicity assay was performed via the MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium\nbromide), which assesses mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity to determine\ncell viability. Optical density readings were taken using a Victor\nX3 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer) at 570 nm, with a reference filter\nat 650 nm. Cell viability was calculated as a percentage, and a modified\nz score test was applied to identify outliers. Different concentrations\nof API were tested (5, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/mL), along with\na 1.2 mg/mL concentration, as recommended by the standard. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Diode Array\nDetection (HPLC-DAD) The identification and quantification\nof psilocybin and psilocin were performed via a mobile phase composed\nof acetonitrile (ACN, HPLC grade) and ultrapure water (H 2 N The identification\nof psilocybin and psilocin in the API was performed via a validated\nmethod, in which the quantification of the substances was determined\nvia eq C PSCB eq C PSC C PSCB C PSC C PSCB = A PSCB + 106,505 18,959 1 C PSC = A PSC + 106,505 18,959 2 A PSCB A PSC Solubility The solubility assay was performed via the\nequilibrium method, following the Dissolution Guide for Generic, New,\nand Similar Drugs. The procedure involved the addition of an excess amount of\nAPI to obtain saturated solutions, which were maintained under controlled\nagitation at 37 ± 1 °C for 24 to 48 h until thermodynamic\nequilibrium was reached. The media selected for this evaluation were\n0.1 mol/L hydrochloric acid (pH 1.2), 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate buffer\n(pH 4.5), and 5 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). In each\nflask, 40 mL of the respective solution was added, followed by incremental\naddition of the API extract until the solvent reached saturation,\nas indicated by undissolved material settling at the bottom of the\ncontainer. Approximately 5 mg of psilocybin was used, corresponding\nto an estimated 0.43 mg of psilocin within that API mass. The\nanalysis was carried out via the shake-flask method with a\nshaker incubator (IKA KS 4000i), maintaining constant agitation at\n200 rpm and 37 °C for 24 h. During the incubation period, 1 mL\nsamples were collected at 24 and 48 h, and the volume was replaced\nwith 1 mL of blank solvent. After collection, the samples were filtered\nthrough 0.22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and\nquantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). On the\nbasis of the concentrations obtained, the dose/solubility (D/S) ratio\nwas calculated from the amount of API used and the measured concentration,\nas described in eq D S = Mass used ( mg ) Measured concentration ( mg / mL ) 3 Results and Discussion Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Combined with Energy-Dispersive\nX-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nwas performed to analyze the morphology of the Psilocybe Figure 1 Micrographs\nof the samples from (1) the outer cap surface, (2)\nthe inner cap (gill region), and (3) the stipe at magnifications of\n(a) 250× and (b) 1000×. The particle morphology of the mushroom powder\nwas analyzed at\n250× magnification, along with elemental composition analysis\nvia energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), in order to estimate\nthe approximate elemental content, with a particular emphasis on phosphorus,\nan element present in the chemical structure of psilocybin, as shown\nin Figure 2 Micrograph and EDS analysis\nof the macerated mushroom at 250×\nmagnification. On the left, elemental distribution maps for carbon,\noxygen, potassium, and phosphorus. On the right, the elemental composition\nat selected points within the image shows the corresponding EDS spectra\nwith peak intensities for each detected element. Studies on edible mushrooms have reported the presence\nof elements\nsuch as calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc,\ncopper, manganese, and selenium.  X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Macronutrients such as carbon\n(C), hydrogen (H), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chlorine (Cl), and\ncalcium (Ca), among others, are typically present at concentrations\nin the percentage range or in milligrams per gram (mg/g). Micronutrients,\nor trace elements, such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), and\ncobalt (Co), among others, are found at significantly lower concentrations,\ntypically in the microgram per gram (μg/g) to nanogram per gram\n(ng/g) range.

As observed by Sharma, Figure Psilocybe Lentinus edodes On the basis of DSC analysis Figure H H H H The particle processing\nconditions of Tremella fuciformis On the basis of\nthe STA analysis, infrared spectra were collected\nat the characteristic temperatures corresponding to the mass loss\npeaks observed in the TGA/DTG curves and the thermal events identified\nvia DSC in order to elucidate the structures of the volatilized substances,\nas shown in Figure 5 FTIR spectra\nof gases evolved during STA analysis of the mushroom\npowder collected at approximately 75, 143, 202, 310, and 353 °C. In the mushroom powder, the initial mass loss observed\nbetween\n30–117 °C, with a maximum at 75 °C, was associated\nwith the release of adsorbed and chemically bound water within the\nmaterial matrix. This event was corroborated by the presence of an\ninfrared absorption band at approximately 1640 cm –1 –1 –1 –1 –1 –1 –1 –1 2 –1  Like\nthe thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning\ncalorimetry (DSC) results obtained for the mushroom powder, the analysis\nof the mushroom extract ( Figure  6 TGA-DTG-DSC curves of the extract sample (API). The second mass loss occurred between 240–400\n°C, with\na prominent DTG peak at 300 °C and a secondary peak at 312 °C.\nThis thermal event is associated with the degradation of organic compounds,\nparticularly polysaccharides extracted from mushroom cell walls. Previous\nstudies have reported that constituents such as cellulose and hemicellulose\nundergo significant thermal decomposition within this temperature\nrange. DSC analysis complements this interpretation\nby revealing both\nendothermic and exothermic transitions. The endothermic peak near\n100 °C is attributed to water evaporation, whereas the exothermic\nevents observed at approximately 350 and 450 °C are associated\nwith the degradation and combustion of organic compounds. The absence\nof more pronounced endothermic peaks above150 °C suggests that\nthe compounds present in the extract exhibit high thermal stability\nor were already released during earlier stages. To gain a better understanding\nof the substances volatilized during the thermal process, the FTIR\nspectra of the compounds released at the peak temperatures of the\nthermal events were analyzed, as shown in Figure 7 FTIR spectra of the gases released during the\nSTA analysis of the\nAPI collected at different temperatures. In the initial temperature range of 120 °C,\na band between\n1720–1840 cm –1 –1 –1 –1 –1 –1 –1 2 –1 –1 –1 2  Compared with the raw mushroom, the extract exhibited a more\nclearly\ndefined profile of thermal events, reflecting the concentration of\nspecific compounds present during the extraction process. In whole\nmushrooms, the release of adsorbed water occurs at slightly lower\ntemperatures, indicating lower moisture retention than in the extract.\nFurthermore, the presence of polysaccharides and lignin is more pronounced\nin the whole mushroom, as demonstrated by the higher intensity of\nbands related to C–O vibrations and CO 2 –1 Phytochemical Analysis The qualitative phytochemical\nanalyses ( Table Psilocybe 2 Qualitative Results of the Phytochemical\nTests on the Psilocybe Mushroom Powder and API Obtained test mushroom\npowder API saponins positive negative polysaccharides positive positive tannins and phenolic compounds positive positive flavonoids positive positive alkaloids positive positive steroids and terpenoids positive negative quinones negative negative coumarins negative negative The presence of alkaloids, tannins, phenolic compounds,\npolysaccharides,\nand flavonoids in the extract confirms the occurrence of bioactive\nprinciples that may exhibit medicinal properties.

The cells were cultured and exposed to the\nAPI at concentrations of 5, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 1200 μg/mL.\nThe assay was conducted in 12-well plates, and the average standard\ndeviation was calculated, as shown in Figure  9 Cell viability assessment at different concentrations\nof the API\n(5, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 1200 μg/mL). On the basis of the cell viability results, lower\nconcentrations\nof the API (<50 μg/mL) resulted in viability levels below\n70%, whereas concentrations above this threshold maintained cell viability\nabove 74%. The highest concentration tested (1.2 mg/mL or 1200 μg/mL)\nresulted in a cell viability profile comparable to that of the other\nconcentrations, indicating the absence of cytotoxic effects even at\nhigh doses. These findings suggest a low toxicity threshold for the\nstudied extract, reinforcing its potential for pharmaceutical applications. A study conducted by Taofiq et al. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Diode Array\nDetection (HPLC-DAD) High-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC) was employed to identify and quantify the presence of psilocybin\nand psilocin in the obtained API. Qualitative identification of the\ncompounds was carried out and confirmed through the injection of analytical\nstandards of psilocybin (PSCB) and psilocin (PSC), along with the\nAPI sample, with the absorbance monitored at 266 nm, as shown in Figure Figure 10 Representative HPLC chromatograms of standard psilocybin\n(PSCB),\npsilocin (PSC), and the obtained active pharmaceutical ingredient\n(API). 11 Comparison of UV–Vis spectra for standard compounds\n(PSCB\nand PSC) and the obtained API. The retention of the PSCB and PSC standards is\nconsistent with\ntheir respective molecular polarity properties, which results in distinct\nretention times due to their specific interactions with the chromatographic\ncolumn. Moreover, the chromatogram of the extract shows peaks corresponding\nto those of the PSCB and PSC standards, indicating the presence of\nthese compounds in the API. The PSCB peaks in the extract appear with\nmoderate intensity, whereas the PSC peak appears as a baseline deviation,\nsuggesting that this compound is present in very low amounts. Additional\nminor peaks, which do not match those of the standards, may indicate\nthe presence of other compounds in the extract, such as secondary\nmetabolites or polysaccharides. With respect to retention time, the\ncompounds were eluted within the expected range, with only minor variations\nthat do not compromise the reliability of the results. To confirm\nthe presence of these substances in the API, the UV–Vis absorption\nprofiles revealed spectral similarity between the standards and the\nextract, providing greater confidence in the results presented in Figure As shown\nin Figure HPLC-UV analysis of psilocin and psilocin revealed\nthat the main\npeaks of these compounds occur between 220–230 nm, whereas\nsecondary bands from 260–300 nm are more prominent in psilocin.\nHowever, significant interferences were observed in the crude extracts\ndue to the presence of other matrix components. These findings are also supported by\nthe literature, such as the\nstudy conducted by Christiansen and Rasmussen, Figures Table eqs 6 Quantification of Psilocybin and Psilocin\nin the API derived from Psilocybe Mushroom  area concentration\n(mg/L) injected\nmass (mg) percentage\n(%) PSCB 512799.59 32.66 1.0 3.26 PSC 11911.49 3.46 1.0 0.34 The API obtained from the extraction of mushrooms\nbelonging to\nthe Psilocybe Psilocybe Solubility Information regarding the solubility of\nthe API in dissolution media within the physiological pH range contributes\nto the risk assessment associated with biowaiver decisions, using\nthe Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) as a reference criterion. Figure 12 Concentration percentages of psilocybin (a) and psilocin\n(b) at\n0.24 and 48 h in sodium acetate buffer (black line), sodium phosphate\nbuffer (red line), and hydrochloric acid solution (blue line). Chromatographic analysis demonstrated the stability\nof psilocybin\nin all three tested media at 0.24 and 48 h intervals. The chromatograms\nindicated that the concentration of the active compound remained essentially\nunchanged over time, with only minor fluctuations, thereby indicating\nits resistance to degradation under the experimental conditions of\nthe solubility assay. Based on eqs eq Table 7 Solubility of Psilocybin and Psilocin\nDetermined via the Shake-Flask Method dissolution\nmedium psilocybin\nconcentration(mg/mL) ratio D/S\n(mL) psilocin\nconcentration(mg/mL) sink condition\n(mL) HCl 0.1 M 0.107 ± 0.008 46.71 0.037 ± 0.003 140.143 SAB pH 4.5 0.118\n± 0.005 42.42 0.032 ± 0.008 127.262 SPB pH 6.8 0.115 ± 0.002 43.35 0.032 ± 0.000 130.058 The results revealed no significant differences in\nsolubility across\nthe tested media for either psilocybin or psilocin. Psilocybin exhibited\nthe highest solubility at pH 4.5 (0.118 mg/mL), with slightly lower\nvalues at pH 6.8 (0.115 mg/mL) and pH 1.2 (0.107 mg/mL). Psilocin,\nwhich is more apolar than psilocybin, showed lower solubility in all\nmedia, with only minor variations among them. Psilocybin demonstrated\ngreater solubility under mildly acidic conditions, suggesting that\nthis pH range may be more suitable for conventional oral formulations,\nsuch as capsules and tablets. When compared directly, psilocin is\nless soluble because of its greater lipophilicity. The D/S ratios\nwere found to be below the 250 mL threshold, which\nclassifies psilocybin as a high-solubility drug across all tested\npH media, according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System\n(BCS). Therefore, it can be categorized as a Class I compound with\nhigh solubility and high permeability. Additionally, psilocybin recovery\ndata revealed 85.6% in HCl, 94.32% in SAB, and 92.24% in SPB. Although\nthe operational conditions were not optimal, the results suggest that\npsilocin also has D/S values below 250 mL, indicating that it may\nlikewise be classified as a high-solubility compound.
