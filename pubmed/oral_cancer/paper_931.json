To use the most efficient method, it is worth combining in silico and in vitro experiments. Among the tools that can support an in silico analysis are databases such as the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (AMPD) or BIOPEP-UWM. The aim of this study was to make an in silico hydrolysis of peptides with anticancer properties selected from the AMP database, using pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Most peptides obtained had properties inhibiting ACE and dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity. Among the resulting peptides, those with the sequence AR, CF, ER, TF, IY, ER, AW, GF, TW, SK and IM are potentially resistant to peptidase from microbial action. An analysis of the peptides’ characteristics showed that peptides with the sequence AR, EK, ER and SK are well-soluble in water and have high affinity for protein and ligand binding. Peptides with the sequence TF, IL and PF are unstable. Thermostable peptides are PGL, IL, GL, IY, VF, PL, IM and QL. The results of the study may be used to design in vitro experiments. peptides in silico biologically active anticancer peptides antimicrobial peptides This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Plant peptides are ubiquitously found in various parts of plants, including roots, seeds, flowers, stems, and leaves [ 1 2 1 3 4 Antibacterial plant-derived peptides (AMPs) are emerging as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their potent antimicrobial properties and lower likelihood of inducing resistance. Plant-derived AMPs exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against various pathogens, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses [ 5 6 7 8 5 9 10 11 12 13 10 11 12 13 14 10 15 16 17 11 12 13 15 18 11 19 20 11 13 10 15 There is a class of plant AMPs that have demonstrated anticancer activity, with some showing the ability to bind to cancer cell membranes and cause lysis. Modern personalized therapies are now available for oncological patients, which extend Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). In addition to the still widely used chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy and immunotherapies are becoming increasingly applicable [ 21 22 Chemotherapy often causes serious side effects and leads to treatment resistance. Moreover, when using personalized therapies, there are different types of side effects, especially visible in immunotherapy targeted at immune checkpoints (ICI). Further, despite the effectiveness of modern cancer treatments, some patients experience resistance to therapy, the causes of which are not fully understood [ 23 24 New compounds for cancer treatment with high efficacy and low toxicity are being sought. An example of such compounds are AMPs, which exert their anticancer effects primarily by destroying cell membranes; therefore, AMPs also have unique advantages in combating drug-resistant cancer cells [ 25 26 27 Defensins, thionins, and cyclotides have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and cytotoxic effects, which can be used to fight cancer cells. Peptides such as Pyrularia Viscotoxin Ligatoxin β -Purothionin 28 29 Capsicum chinense 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Moreover, peptides can influence the tumor microenvironment, which participates in carcinogenesis at each of its stages. Through the use of appropriately prepared/modified peptides, the response to the applied registered treatment can be modulated, so they can serve as agents in supportive therapies [ 41 42 There are many methods for obtaining biologically active peptides. The choice of a method depends on the starting material and the desired effect. Each method has its limitations and advantages. Among the methods for obtaining and characterizing biologically active peptides, there are in silico ones. In order to increase the accuracy and reliability of research on bioactive peptides, in silico studies are combined with in vitro and in vivo studies. This approach is particularly useful for identifying bioactive peptides from food sources and other biological materials. In silico methods are used to design peptides with high specificity and low toxicity for therapeutic purposes [ 43 44 The aim of this study was to make an in silico hydrolysis of antimicrobial peptides with anticancer properties. Proteolytic enzymes of the digestive system, i.e., pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin, were selected for hydrolysis. The peptides obtained were tested in terms of resistance to the action of enzymes produced by gastrointestinal microorganisms and were analyzed for their physicochemical properties. 2. Results 2.1. Peptide Sequences After In Silico Hydrolysis with Gastrointestinal Track Enzymes The peptides found in the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (AMPD) were in silico hydrolyzed under gastrointestinal tract conditions, and the all results are shown in Table S1 Table 1 2.2. Peptide Sequences After Hydrolysis with Microbial Enzymes In order to check whether the enzymes obtained are potentially resistant to the action of proteolytic enzymes produced by microorganisms in the small intestine, the peptides were hydrolyzed using oligopeptidase F and proteinase P1. The results are shown in Table 2 2.3. Characterization of the Peptides The peptides were characterized according to physicochemical properties. Peptides with the sequences AR, EK, ER, PK, SK and QH were characterized by BI higher than 2.48, which suggested their high binding to the cell membrane or other protein receptors. Moreover, the peptides PK, SK, EK and ER are characteristic for a domain rich in basic residue, which promotes DNA/RNA binding. They are often found in nuclear localization sequences (NLS). This peptide signal sequence mediates the transfer of proteins from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. They are related, inter alia 45 46 47 All of the peptides have pI values of around or higher than 6. According to the results, it appears that only three peptides, with the sequence TF, IL or PF, are unstable. Some of the peptides—PGL, IL, GL, IY, VF, PL, IM and QL—are characterized by high thermostability. These peptides can be transported through the PEPT1/PEPT2 system; as short peptides, they can be transported by specific transporters in the small intestine. Most of the peptides obtained have a positive GRAVY index, meaning that they are hydrophobic. They can be components of membrane proteins. However, eight of the peptides are hydrophilic and can be components of soluble proteins. Their sequence is AR, EK, ER, PK, TW, PW, SK and QH. Only seven peptides, with the sequence AR, EK, ER, GK, PK SK and QH, are soluble in water. These peptides occur naturally in organisms and perform signaling, hormonal or neuromodulator functions. 3. Discussion Biologically active peptides consist of 2 to 30 amino acid residues and can perform various biological and technological functions in the production of food, dietary supplements and drugs. There are many methods for obtaining biologically active peptides, and the choice of a method depends on the efficiency, application and source of these compounds. The most common methods include enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins, isolation of free peptides or de novo synthesis. Due to the fact that proteins are often the reserve material of plants, they are a good source of biologically active peptides. Currently, many experimental methods are preceded by data analysis and the use of in silico methods, enabled by various tools. This provides a basis for further research and is often considered a preliminary study or analysis of the research problem [ 48 49 50 Plant-derived peptides obtained from the hydrolysis of plant proteins exhibit a wide range of stimulating activities, e.g., antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory ones beneficial for human health. These peptides are bioactive compounds with diverse physiological functions, exhibiting a wide range of inhibitory activities against various enzymes, like inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), renin, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and peptidases, with significant potential for therapeutic applications in managing hypertension, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders [ 51 52 53 54 A very important group of biologically active peptides consists of AMPs, which play a significant role in combating the activity of pathogenic microorganisms by being able to prevent their growth and colonization. They are natural biopolymers in organism protection. They exhibit broad activity against bacteria, viruses, and fungi [ 55 26 27 Nevertheless, plant-derived antimicrobial oligopeptides are a good source of peptides that exhibit various biological functions and which can be released in the digestive system. In this study, 57 oligopeptides with anticancer properties were selected from the AMP database and hydrolyzed in silico 56 57 Table 1 58 59 Mattirolomyces terfezioides 59 Studies on the protein stability of the Serendipity berry plant ( Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii 60 61 Elisha et al. studied cow’s and human milk proteins as a potential source of peptides with ACE- and dipeptidyl peptidase IV-inhibiting properties. In this case, in silico studies also confirmed experimental studies using proteolytic enzymes from the digestive system [ 62 Therefore, it is advisable to conduct in silico studies, which significantly shortens the time and is less time-consuming and labor-intensive. It also allows for the appropriate selection of research material, which can contribute to increased effectiveness of in vitro and in vivo studies. Plant-derived peptides have garnered significant attention due to their potent antioxidant properties, which can protect against oxidative damage and related diseases. These peptides are primarily obtained through the enzymatic hydrolysis of plant proteins, which breaks down the proteins into smaller, bioactive fragments [ 63 64 65 66 67 52 68 66 67 69 67 Table 1 66 69 Plant-derived antihypertensive peptides are gaining attention as natural supplements for managing hypertension owing to their efficacy, safety, and non-toxic side effects. These peptides are fragments of plant proteins that exhibit biological activity, particularly in inhibiting enzymes involved in blood pressure regulation [ 51 70 71 72 51 52 71 71 71 53 The relationship between the amino acid composition and ACE inhibition has not been fully elucidated. Dipeptides including L, Q, P, M or A in their structure have been shown to have strong ACE inhibitory activity. Moreover, tripeptides with L, C or P also exhibit strong ACE inhibitory activity. It should be noted that peptides with hydrophobic C-terminus amino acids are potent ACE inhibitors. Additionally, peptides with a molecular mass below 2 kDa tend to have higher ACE inhibitory activity due to better absorption and bioavailability [ 73 Table 1 62 Plant-derived peptides interact with the human immune system through various mechanisms, including immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory activities. Plant-derived peptides exhibit significant anti-inflammatory properties through various mechanisms. These peptides can modulate inflammatory responses by interacting with specific cellular pathways and molecules [ 74 75 76 75 77 78 79 78 80 80 78 To test the potential use of the peptides obtained as compounds that could be transported in the small intestine to their target sites, their resistance to microbial enzymes was tested in silico. The peptides were hydrolyzed using oligopeptidase F and proteinase P1. This process was also conducted using the BIOPEP databases. The results indicate that not all peptides with specific functions are stable to the action of these enzymes ( Table 2 81 82 83 84 Proteolytic instability is one of the key features of peptides and peptide-containing products, which determines their use in the production of food, dietary supplements or pharmacological compounds. Research is underway to increase their resistance to peptidases/proteinases or to enhance their stability in plasma or serum. These methods most often involve chemical or physical modification, and are often labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. Therefore, understanding the chemical properties of peptides that influence their degradation facilitates modifications intended to increase their stability. One of the important features of peptides in this context is the determination of the peptide half-life (t ½), which is usually quite short and ranges from 2 to 20 min. Some studies show, however, that the t ½ of these compounds can be even more than 300 min [ 85 86 Moreover, one of the peptides (IL) obtained has neuropeptide properties. Neuropeptides are involved in numerous biological processes, including neurotransmission, neuromodulation, and hormonal regulation. They control functions like cardiovascular activity, energy homeostasis, reproduction, growth, behavior, and stress response [ 54 One of the key stages in peptide research is physicochemical analysis, which employs various techniques and methods to determine properties of peptides and possible applications in various fields, including diagnostics, food technology, biotechnology, drug development, and proteomics [ 87 88 Table 3 86 89 The Boman index is a measure used to predict the potential biological activity of peptides, particularly their ability to bind to membranes or other proteins as receptors. It is expressed in kcal/mol, and it is calculated from the sum of free energies of the amino acid residues in a peptide sequence. Molecules have high binding potential if the BI is higher than 2.48 [ 90 Zea mays mexicana 91 92 93 94 In this study, only two peptides were determined as unstable. They are the peptides with the sequence TF, IL and PF. These dipeptides are composed of hydrophobic amino acids and are poorly soluble in water, so they may not be easy research material in an aqueous environment. The GRAVY index may define the overall hydropathy of a peptide. In this study, the peptides with the sequence AR, EK, ER, PK, TW, PW, SK and QH were characterized by a negative GRAVY index, which indicated their hydrophilic character, meaning that they interact well with water and are likely to be soluble in aqueous environments. Understanding this index helps to predict protein behavior in different environments and can aid in such applications as drug design and protein engineering. Filleria et al. ([ 95 H P 95 96 97 4. Materials and Methods The material for the study was composed of 57 plant peptides ( Table 4 https://aps.unmc.edu/home 4.1. In Silico Enzymatic Hydrolysis 4.1.1. Hydrolysis with Gastrointestinal Track Enzymes The selected peptides were hydrolyzed using BIOPEP-UWM™ database tools [ 98 4.1.2. Hydrolysis with Microbial Enzymes Peptides with biological activity were in silico hydrolyzed with oligopeptidase F and proteinase P1 (EC 3.4.21.96). These enzymes were produced by gastrointestinal track microorganisms. 4.2. Analysis of the Physicochemical Characteristics of Bioactive Peptides The physicochemical characteristics of peptides were predicted with online tools. The Boman index was estimated by the Antimicrobial Peptide Designer ( https://aps.unmc.edu/ https://pepcalc.com/ https://proteiniq.io/tools#protein-tools 5. Conclusions In silico methods have become essential tools in the study and prediction of the biological properties of peptides. These computational approaches offer significant advantages in terms of cost and time efficiency compared to traditional experimental methods. In this study, 57 plant peptides with anticancer properties selected from the Antimicrobial Peptide Database ( https://aps.unmc.edu/home Acknowledgments During the preparation of this manuscript/study, the authors used Scopus AI for the purposes of a literature study.
