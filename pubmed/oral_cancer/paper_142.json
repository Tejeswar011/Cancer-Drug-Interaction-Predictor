Our aim was to investigate how dermato-oncologists in Germany prioritize efficacy, toxicity, and application mode of modern adjuvants in these stages. In a nationwide discrete choice experiment physicians evaluated hypothetical treatment scenarios that varied in recurrence risk, risk of severe adverse events, type of adverse events, and mode of administration. Two patient profiles were presented, including a 55-year-old healthy patient in stage IIB (P1) and an 83-year-old patient in stage IIC with comorbidity (P2). Physicians ( n p p SIGNIFICANCE This study explored how skin cancer specialists in Germany make decisions regarding adjuvant treatment for patients with stage IIB/C melanoma. Using hypothetical scenarios, 112 physicians chose between different treatment options for a younger, healthier patient and an older patient with comorbidities. Physicians placed greatest importance on avoiding severe side effects, especially for the older patient. They preferred treatments given by infusion over pills and found immune-related adverse events less acceptable than other side effects. Overall, physicians most valued safety, particularly for older patients with comorbidity. These preferences should be reconciled with patients’ preferences and expectations.

Implemented first for metastatic disease, PD-1 inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors successively became standard for adjuvant therapy of stage III melanoma ( 1 4 5 9 10 11 10 5 8 12 6 8 12 13 Patients with BRAF V600-mutated stage III melanoma have the additional option of adjuvant targeted therapy with dabrafenib/trametinib, which improves 10-year recurrence-free survival by 48% ( 4 14 15 Choosing the most appropriate adjuvant therapy for each patient requires careful balancing of benefits and risks in the context of patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidity, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status as well as individual preferences. Alternatively, forgoing adjuvant therapy may be the best option for some patients, particularly elderly ones and those with a favourable prognosis after surgery alone. In order to identify a concept that is optimal from the medical perspective, but also fits the patient’s individual needs, wishes, and treatment goals, these aspects have to be discussed thoroughly during shared decision-making. As physicians’ attitudes towards efficacy, toxicity, and recurrence risk may influence the method of counselling and treatment recommendations, understanding their preferences and unravelling potential differences between physicians’ and patients’ perspectives is critical. In a previous study, we found that patients with metastatic melanoma most valued treatment efficacy, followed by safety, while the treatment process mattered less ( 16 The aim of our study was to assess how dermato-oncologists prioritize outcome and process attributes of adjuvant therapies for stage IIB/C melanoma. Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), we sought to examine the trade-offs physicians are willing to make between efficacy, side effects, and treatment burden. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population Data collection was conducted from 16 March 2024 to 21 November 2024 nationwide across Germany. Dermatologists, oncologists, and residents in dermatology with at least 1 year’s experience in melanoma therapy were eligible for participation. Participants were recruited through email newsletters of the German Working Group Dermatological Oncology (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Dermatologische Onkologie, ADO), which currently comprises more than 650 members, emails to the heads of all 82 certified German skin cancer centres, and information stands at relevant conferences. All participants received detailed information on the study and gave informed consent before participation. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Charité University Medicine Berlin (EA4/110/17, amendment 29 December 2023) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data collection The questionnaire including the DCE was created with Sawtooth Software (Lighthouse Studio version 9.15.4, Provo, UT, USA). Participants could choose between an online and a paper-and-pencil version. The first part contained questions on sociodemographic characteristics, professional background, and experience with melanoma therapies. The second part comprised the DCE. Discrete choice experiment (DCE) For generating the DCE, the PD-1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab and the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations encorafenib/binimetinib and dabrafenib/trametinib were decomposed into outcome and process attributes and attribute levels. Outcome attributes encompassed the risk of recurrence within the first year, the risk of severe treatment-related AE, and typical treatment-related AE. Recurrence risk within the first year was chosen because accordant data were available for both PD-1 inhibitors at the time of drafting the questionnaire. The process attribute referred to the mode and frequency of application. Each attribute was associated with levels realistically reflecting the different treatments and the opt-out option ( Table I 5 8 12 14 17 19 Table I Attributes and attribute levels used in the discrete choice experiments Attribute Attribute level Treatment No treatment Risk of recurrence within the first year 5% Approximately twice as high as the less favourable rate of the treatment options Risk of severe, treatment-related adverse events 10% 0% Typical adverse events Immune-related AE, e.g., thyroiditis, colitis, or hepatitis No treatment-related AE Mode and frequency of application Infusions every 2–4 weeks No medication Using Sawtooth Software, hypothetical choice scenarios were generated by combining the different attributes and levels. Twenty-two choice scenarios were randomly assigned to each questionnaire based on an orthogonal design with balanced level overlap. In each scenario, participants were asked to choose between 2 paired treatment options and an opt-out option. Additionally, 2 fixed control scenarios, in which 1 option was clearly superior, were included for validation. Scenarios were generated for 2 distinct patient profiles: Patient 1 (P1), 55 years, non-ulcerated melanoma with a Breslow index of 6 mm, stage IIB, BRAF V600 mutation, ECOG status 0 and arterial hypertension as comorbidity; and Patient 2 (P2), 83 years, ulcerated melanoma with a Breslow index of 6 mm, stage IIC, BRAF V600 mutation, ECOG status 1 and chronic kidney disease stage III, atrial fibrillation, and insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes as comorbidities. An example of a DCE is presented in Table II Table II Example of a discrete choice scenario When answering the following questions, please imagine that you are treating a patient with a non-ulcerated melanoma tumour thickness of 6 mm and a BRAF V600 mutation stage IIB 55-year-old patient ECOG performance status of 0 arterial hypertension Adjuvant treatment A Adjuvant treatment B No adjuvant treatment Risk of recurrence within the first year 10% 5% Approximately twice as high as the less favorable rate of the treatment options Risk of severe, treatment-related AE 10% 30% 0% Typical AE Immune-related AE, e.g. thyroiditis, colitis or hepatitis Gastrointestinal AE, elevated liver enzymes, pyrexia No treatment-related AE Mode and frequency of application Infusions every 3–6 weeks Intake of 5 tablets per day, divided into 2 doses No medication Which option would you prefer for the patient’s adjuvant treatment? O O O Relative importance scores (RIS) and part-worth utilities (PWU) were calculated individually for each attribute, patient profile, and participant and averaged across the study population. Hierarchical Bayesian estimation was applied to determine PWU for each attribute level, with positive values indicating greater preference (utility) and negative values indicating disutility. RIS were computed by dividing the utility range (difference between highest and lowest values) of each attribute by the sum of all attribute ranges. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 29, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were reported as absolute and relative frequencies. Metric variables were summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, and interquartile ranges. Subgroup analyses based on professional qualification (specialists vs residents) were performed with Mann–Whitney U 2 2 p RESULTS Study population A total of 115 physicians participated in the study.

We show how they balance recurrence risk reduction with toxicity risks in light of patient-specific characteristics like age, comorbidities, and tumour stage. The cohort comprised 112 experienced physicians and is likely representative of dermato-oncologists working in German skin cancer centres. Physicians opted for adjuvant therapy in 86.4% of the scenarios for the 55-year-old patient in stage IIB and in 60.5% of the scenarios for the 83-year-old patient in stage IIC. In previous DCE on adjuvant melanoma therapy, treatment was chosen in 78–86% of the scenarios ( 20 21 Our participants ranked the risk of severe AE as the most important attribute across both patient profiles, followed by the risk of recurrence within the first year. This cautious attitude contrasts with physicians’ preferences for adjuvant melanoma therapy in stage III, where efficacy was valued higher ( 20 23 24 Treatment preferences were influenced by clinical experience. Specialists had greater concerns about immune-mediated AE than residents in the older patient, possibly because they have encountered severe immune-mediated AE more frequently. They bear full responsibility for management of these AE, whereas residents can refer to senior colleagues. Specialists were also less likely than residents to recommend adjuvant therapy explicitly, possibly because residents adhere more closely to guidelines, whereas experienced physicians incorporate practical experience and offer a more nuanced benefit–risk assessment during consultation. Attribute weighting varied between patient profiles. For the younger patient with stage IIB melanoma, recurrence risk was more influential, whereas for the older patient with stage IIC and comorbidities, concerns about toxicity were more relevant, indicating that physicians are more willing to accept AE in younger patients, but prioritize safety in older, comorbid ones. In line with our findings, Livingstone et al. reported a lower likelihood of recommending immunotherapy for patients aged > 80 years with low performance status, especially if their recurrence risk was low or comorbidities reduced life expectancy ( 24 23 Our participants rated type of AE and mode and frequency of administration as less relevant than recurrence risk and severe AE, findings substantially compatible with results by Beusterien et al. ( 20 21 23 Our participants preferred infusions to oral therapies, especially if the latter involved a large number of tablets, matching preferences of patients for treatment of metastatic melanoma identified in our previous DCE ( 16 21 23 25 When asked explicitly, 88.4% of our participants favoured treatment for the younger patient in stage IIB, whereas only 56.3% advocated adjuvant therapy for the older patient in stage IIC. Real-world data show acceptance rates between 77% and 91% in stage III and IV ( 26 28 28 Limitations Our study was conducted exclusively in Germany. Therefore, its results may not be conferrable to other countries with different healthcare systems. Even if our cohort comprised experienced dermato-oncologists from many different skin cancer centres, results should be validated in a larger sample. As a DCE relies on hypothetical scenarios, the choices made by participants may not fully reflect real-world decision-making. Additionally, the number of attributes and attribute levels that can be included in a DCE has to be limited to prevent information overload, which may have led to omission of potentially relevant attributes. Moreover, we incorporated an adjuvant oral treatment option into our scenarios, as the COLUMBUS-AD trial was ongoing at the time of study conceptualization. However, this trial has been discontinued, and it is uncertain whether another oral therapy will become available as adjuvant treatment in stage II. As patient characteristics, including age, comorbidities, and tumour stage, have a substantial impact on treatment decisions, predefined patient profiles were used to enable a structured comparison of participant preferences. However, treatment decisions may differ in real-world settings with varying patient characteristics. Finally, physicians’ preferences may change over time as new medications and updated long-term data on adjuvant melanoma treatment become available. Conclusions This study provides valuable insights into preferences of dermato-oncologists in Germany for adjuvant melanoma therapy in stage IIB/C. The risk of severe AE emerged as the most important attribute, followed by the risk of recurrence. Decisions were strongly influenced by patient characteristics: while recurrence risk was a more relevant factor for the younger patient, toxicity concerns played a dominant role in the older one. Preferences also varied with regard to administration route and number of tablets, favouring less burdensome regimens. These findings underscore the need for shared decision-making approaches that balance clinical evidence with patients’ values and individual benefit–risk considerations, particularly in populations with a higher burden of comorbidities. Understanding physicians’ preferences and reconciling them with patients’ preferences, needs, and treatment goals may contribute to improve shared decision-making in stage II melanoma.
