Fighting alongside him are researchers, doctors, psychologists, biologists, chemists, pharmacists, nurses, trainers, physiotherapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, electrical engineers, architects, and other scientists, even actors and musicians, who aim to prevent and cure the disease, limit its progression, and improve the quality of life of those affected by it. Among them, their caregivers stand out as the most dedicated companions. In a collection of abstracts that reflects the work of all of the above, we capture the results of our biennial scientific meeting, which, thanks to them, is constantly evolving in a promising way. dementia alzheimer parkinson neurodegenerative diseases new technologies caregivers non-pharmacological interventions pharmacological interventions home care palliative care This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction We are all living in a time of fast scientific progress. The amount of ongoing, diverse research that is already being tested and making an impact is overwhelming. As medical professionals who work tirelessly and passionately with patients who have neurodegenerative disorders and their caregivers, it is our responsibility, as well as a necessity, to constantly provide feedback, sharing our knowledge and experience. Organizing the Panhellenic Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease and the Mediterranean Conference on Neurodegenerative Diseases is always a challenge, but it has become our commitment as we continue to progress and hope for a cure. On 13–16 February 2025, the 14th Panhellenic Conference on Alzheimer’s Disease and the 6th Mediterranean Conference on Neurodegenerative Diseases took place. The conferences were hosted over four days, in four parallel halls, with about 400 multidisciplinary speakers and Presidents participating from all over the world. The conference was attended by more than 700 people. Our program covered a wide range of highly significant topics, including the safe use of anti-amyloid drugs, neuropsychological assessment and its future, the role of the caregiver in the quality of life of the family, new care units for end-stage dementia patients, and highlights from European programs and technologies alongside dementia care. Health professionals, people with dementia, caregivers, students, and young scientists attended the conferences in order to be informed in a reliable and up-to-date framework about the latest developments, as well as to participate in workshops and presentations by young neuroscientists from all over the country on Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, both in the diagnostic and therapeutic field. A notable guest at the conference was the Mayo Clinic–Rochester Professor of Neurology–Epidemiology, Walter Rocca. The conference was under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Health, Alzheimer Disease International, the Municipality of Thessaloniki, the Hellenic Association of Geriatrics and Gerontology, the Faculty of Health Sciences A.U.Th., the School of Medicine, the Greek Medical Association, the Panhellenic Pharmaceutical Association, the Greek Red Cross, the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the International Medical Olympicus Association, the Medical Association of Thessaloniki, the Region of Central Macedonia, and the Panhellenic Federation of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders, and received 26 points for Continuing Medical Education (CME-CPD credits) from the Greek National Medical Association (Ref: 6300/LEE24-00144). To ensure excellent scientific support, 112 members of the International and Panhellenic Scientific Committee, who also reviewed the 307 abstracts that we received, collaborated with 26 members of the Organizing Committee. We invite you to read a selection of these abstracts, which represent the fusion of sciences at the service of the patient. Yours sincerely, Magda Tsolaki President of the Organizing Committee 2.

Primary Progressive Aphasia Guide  Natalie Ive, Australian Aphasia Association What I wish people knew about living with primary progressive aphasia. (PPA) is a language-led dementia that affects individuals’ ability to communicate, express thoughts, and understand words. Still, people face barriers to communication and support due to a lack of understanding of the condition. I was diagnosed with PPA in 2021. Consequently, my team and I at the University of Tasmania co-developed a PPA guide to raise awareness and support. This initiative has made a significant impact, and I urge you to join us in championing this cause. Let’s work together to ensure that individuals living with PPA receive the understanding, support, and resources they deserve. Because of my challenges and frustrations with some people not understanding my condition, I met with Professor Jade Cartwright to discuss the need for a PPA strategy and a strategy to raise awareness for support services. Services and supports that too many people with PPA are missing out on! We organised a Zoom meeting, and there was a lot of robust conversation and great brainstorming ideas for creating the PPA strategy. Ultimately, we developed our amazing PPA guide, co-developed by Catherine Taylor, Natalie Ive, Deborah Hersh, and Jade Cartwright. 2.8.

Abstract: APOE ε APOE Olea europaea The advantages of using the concentrated aqueous juice VITA P over the use of EVOO are: Substantially unlimited availability of the product and a very high shelf life (stability) compared to EVOO For the participants the product is much easier to be handled as it will be provided in dropper bottles containing 30–35 mL of product and equipped with a pipette with rubber bulb able to aspirate about 1 mL of liquid. The product can be immediately dissolved in water or another preferred juice by the participant, 10 drops of VITA P contain about 24 mg polyphenols, a quantity higher than total polyphenols in 50 mL HP-EH-EVOO used in the MICOIL pilot Study, 10 drops of VITA P have close to zero calories compared to about 450 Kcal of 50 mL HP-EH-EVOO Study design: Participants will be randomised in four groups, each group of 50 participants. The duration of the study will be 18 months. The four groups include patients with MCI and each participant will be randomised and allocated to one of the four groups: Group 1 will receive VITA P about 40 mg polyphenols/day (16 drops/day) together with MeDi instructions. Group 2 will receive VITA P about 20 mg polyphenols/day (8 drops/day) together with MeDi instructions. Group 3 will receive placebo together with MeDi instructions. Group 4 will receive only MeDi instructions. Keywords: 2.37.
