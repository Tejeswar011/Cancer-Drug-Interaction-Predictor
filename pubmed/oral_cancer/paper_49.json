This study examined the effects of plant extracts on acrylamide formation in French fries prepared using different cooking methods. Potato strips were immersed in three concentrations (1 %, 3 %, and 5 %) of plant extracts (jujube, barberry, and jujube + barberry (50/50)). The potatoes were prepared using two methods: deep frying (200 °C for 8 min) and microwave (900 W for 8 min). The results showed a higher level of acrylamide in the microwave (39.57 μg/kg) compared to deep frying (7.83 μg/kg). Total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and DPPH radical scavenging assay in barberry extracts were significantly higher than in jujube, which explains the greater inhibitory effect of barberry extracts on acrylamide formation. As the concentration of extracts in the treatment increased, the inhibitory effect on acrylamide formation became stronger. The findings of this research indicate that using plant extracts is a simple and effective method for reducing acrylamide formation in fried potatoes. Highlights • Effect of jujube and barberry extracts on the acrylamide in French fries was studied. • Effects of deep fryers and microwave on acrylamide formation were also examined. • Mix of two extracts at 5 % had highest inhibition effect on acrylamide formation. • Amounts of acrylamide formed in microwave method were higher than in deep frying. • Potatoes treated with 5 % extract mixture gain higher sensory evaluation scores.

However, thermal processing can cause adverse effects on food, such as nutrient loss, changes in flavor and texture, and formation of harmful compounds ( Barbhuiya et al., 2021 Seilani et al., 2021 Dourado et al., 2020 Stadler & Gökmen, 2024 3 5 2 Matoso et al., 2019 Esposito et al., 2021 Gholampour et al., 2024 Zhao et al., 2014 Potatoes ( Solanum tuberosum Stott-Miller et al., 2013 EFSA, 2015 Gökmen, 2023 Başaran & Turk, 2021 Palazoǧlu & Gökmen, 2008 Vinci et al., 2012 Sansano et al., 2015 Khosla & Bansal, 2016 Pedreschi et al., 2021 Gökmen, 2023 It has been demonstrated that plants and herbs contain antioxidant compounds capable of inhibiting the formation of AA through the blocking of Maillard reaction intermediates or by scavenging free radicals ( Jin et al., 2013 Zhao et al., 2014 Abbasi et al., 2023 Zokaei et al., 2020 Haddarah et al., 2021 Campos-Vega & Oomah, 2013 Ziziphus jujuba Rashwan et al., 2020 Lu et al., 2021 Khabbazeh et al., 2024 Berberis vulgaris Safari et al., 2020 Kumar et al., 2022 Shekarabi et al., 2022 Several studies have examined the effect of plant extract pre-treatment on AA formation in French fries. Morales et al. (2014) Morales et al., 2014 Haddarah et al., 2021 Zokaei et al., 2020 Wang et al., 2023 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals All chemicals utilized in our study were of analytical grade. Acrylamide, gallic acid, ascorbic acid, quercetin, Carrez I (hexacyanoferrate), Carrez II (zinc acetate), acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, acetone, n-hexane, Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine (DPPH) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). AlCl 3 2 3 2.2 Preparation of extracts The dried fruits of jujubes and barberries were purchased from the market in Birjand, Iran. Following the approval by the Medicinal Plant Research Center of Birjand University of Medical Sciences, the plant species were transferred to the laboratory. For the preparation of extracts, jujube and barberry were ground entirely. Then, 50 g of the plant powder was added to 250 mL of ethanol in water (80:20 v/v) and shaken for 24 h. Finally, the samples were filtered through 110 mm filter papers. The extracts were stored in separate tubes at −20 °C until use ( Rajaei et al., 2021 2.3 Moisture content The moisture content of jujube and barberry was measured according to the method described by Elmore et al. (2005) (1) Moisture content % = Initial mass – Final mass Initial mass × 100 2.4 Ash content In the first step, 3 g of each plant was weighed in a silica crucible, and then the crucibles were put in an electric furnace for 24 h at 600 °C until the plants completely turned into ash. After cooling crucibles in the desiccators, the percentage of ash was calculated utilizing the following formula ( Cunniff & Washington, 1997 (2) Ash content % = Weinght of crucible + ash − Weinght of empty crucible Sample weinght × 100 2.5 Determination of total phenolic compounds (TPC) Different concentrations of gallic acid were prepared in methanol. Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with gallic acid was utilized as standard. Initially, 3.9 mL of deionized water and 250 μL of Folin-Ciocalteu were mixed with 50 μL of the extracts or gallic acid standard solution at different concentrations. The mixture was stirred on a vortex V-3 (Elmi, Latvia) and left in the dark for 4 min. In the next step, 750 μL of 20 % Na 2 3 Lamuela-Raventós, 2018 2.6 Determination of total flavonoid content (TFC) The TFC was measured according to the method described by Romadanova et al. (2021) 3 2.7 DPPH radical scavenging assay The antioxidant capacity of the jujube and barberry extracts was determined using the DPPH radical scavenging method. First, 0.15 mM/L was added to ethanol, then 1 mL of DPPH was blended with 3 mL of extracts or ascorbic acid (standard). A control sample containing 1 mL of DPPH with 3 mL of solvent was also prepared. All the samples were incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. The following formula was used to calculate the percentage of radical scavenging activity ( Makhlouf-Gafsi et al., 2018 (3) Scavenging activity % = Absorbance control − Absorbance sample Absorbance control × 100 2.8 Preparation of potato samples In total, 16 kg of potatoes were purchased from Birjand, Iran. Initially, the potatoes were washed and disinfected, then stripped by friction peeling, and black or green spots were removed. Then, potatoes were cut into 1 × 1 × 5 thicknesses with a manual cutter. Before cooking, the potatoes were soaked in plant extracts of jujube, barberry, and a mixture of jujube and barberry (50/50) at concentrations of 1 %, 3 %, and 5 % for 4 min. The potatoes used as the control group were soaked in deionized water. Two different cooking techniques were used to cook potato strips, including deep frying (DF) and microwave (MW). In the DF method, potato strips are entirely immersed in oil in a frying pan without a lid at 200 °C for 8 min. In the MW method, potato slices are heated at 900 W for 8 min in the microwave ( Michalak et al., 2011 2.9 Determination of acrylamide in samples 2.9.1 Sample preparation For the deep-fried potatoes, 4 g of the sample was ground and added to 13 mL of n-hexane, then kept at 25 °C for 24 h. After removing and evaporating the n-hexane, 13 mL of acetone was mixed with the sample, which was subsequently homogenized using ultrasonication for 20 min at 40 °C. Finally, 1 mL of Carrez I and 1 mL of Carrez II were added to the mixture, and after mixing for 2 min, the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 2500 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and the acetone was evaporated. After that, 3 mL of deionized water was added to the final sample containing AA, and finally, the solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter ( Haddarah et al., 2021 v Ateş & Unal, 2023 2.9.2 Acrylamide determination by HPLC-PDA The sample analysis was conducted using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a Photo Diode Array detector (PDA) (Waters E2695 Alliance, USA). The column used was a C18 reversed-phase column (Eclipse Plus C18; 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm). The operational conditions were as follows: the mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile/deionized water (5:95 ratio). The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min isocratic, and the injection volume was 50 μL. The retention time was 4.419 min, and the run time was 6 min. For method validation, the linearity, limit of detection (LOD, based on signal-to-noise ratio = 3), limit of quantification (LOQ, based on signal-to-noise ratio = 10), recovery rate, repeatability, and reproducibility were evaluated. The standard stock solution of 1000 μg/mL AA was obtained by dissolving 0.1 g of the AA analytical standard in 100 mL of water. An intermediate stock solution of 20 μg/mL AA was then obtained by adding 1 mL of the standard stock solution to a 50 mL volumetric flask and diluting it with deionized water. Seven calibration solutions of AA at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 3.5, and 4 μg/mL were prepared by diluting the intermediate stock solution with HPLC-grade water and injecting it into the HPLC-PDA. 2.10 Determination of the oil content To determine the amount of oil absorbed by the potato samples, 4 g of each sample was accurately weighed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and the weight of each sample in the centrifuge tube was recorded. The extraction was performed with 13 mL of n-hexane for 24 h at 25 °C. Then, the sample was placed at 25 °C to evaporate its solvent. The weights of the tube and the dried sample were then recorded. Finally, the oil content was calculated from the difference in the weights of the centrifuge tube and the sample before and after extraction ( Cunniff & Washington, 1997 2.11 Sensory evaluation For the sensory evaluation, ten students from Birjand University of Medical Sciences were selected and received the necessary training. The coded samples were provided to ten panelists for assessment. The sensory evaluation was conducted according to the 5-point hedonic scale (1: extremely dislike to 5: extremely like) to assess the odor, color, taste, texture, and overall acceptability of the French fries ( Pérez-López et al., 2021 2.12 Health risk assessment The estimated daily intake (EDI) of acrylamide formed in control samples of French fries was computed employing the following equation: (4) EDI = C × IR × EF × ED BW × AT The non-carcinogenic health risks of acrylamide in French fries were evaluated using the target hazard quotient (THQ). The oral reference dose (RfD) for acrylamide is 0.002 mg/kg/day. The THQ values were computed using the following equation: (5) THQ = EDI R f D The carcinogenic health risks resulting from exposure to acrylamide by consumption of French fries were evaluated by incremental lifetime cancer risk (CR) utilizing the following equation: (6) ILCR = EDI × CSF CSF is the slope factor, which for acrylamide is 0.5 mg/kg/day ( Aghvami et al., 2023 Akbari-Adergani et al., 2023 Faraji et al., 2024 Seilani et al., 2021 Velotto et al., 2025 2.13 Statistical analysis All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and data were expressed as Mean ± SD. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS v22 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The normality of the data was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's post hoc test and Kruskal-Wallis test.

(2022) Zhao et al. (2014) Abbas et al., 2017 Mohammad Salamatullah et al., 2022 3.2 DPPH radical scavenging capacity Plant extracts, rich in antioxidant components, can donate hydrogen atoms or electrons to neutralize free radicals. The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was evaluated using DPPH, a stable free radical ( Maizura et al., 2011 Fig. 1 Eroğlu et al. (2020) Wang et al., 2020 Dahlia et al., 2020 Wojdyło et al.

Moreover, increasing the concentration of each plant extract increases the inhibitory effect on AA generation. The highest inhibitory effect on AA formation was related to the treatment of Mix 5 % in different cooking methods. Plant extracts rich in antioxidants have been examined as possible inhibitors of AA generation. Nonetheless, research conducted in different models and food systems has shown that the impact of these extracts on AA reduction is unclear. These impacts are mostly linked to phytochemicals with antioxidant power, carbonyl trapping activity, and the effects of amino acid precipitation ( Liu et al., 2015 Jing et al., 2019 Wang et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2023 Vattem and Shetty (2003) Cheng et al. (2010) 3.5 Sensory evaluation The sensory evaluation was conducted to assess the effects of jujube and barberry extracts on the organoleptic properties of French fries prepared by deep frying and microwaving.

The findings showed that both types of extracts, especially at higher concentrations, significantly reduced AA levels in French fries. The mix of two extracts at 5 % had the strongest inhibitory effect on AA formation, regardless of the cooking method. These reductions were linked to the high phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts, which boost antioxidant activity and may reduce AA formation through mechanisms such as scavenging free radicals and trapping carbonyl compounds. Microwave-cooked samples consistently had higher AA levels than those cooked by deep frying, likely due to more intense internal heating and changes in moisture behavior. Although some extracts slightly decreased oil absorption, the overall effect on fat content was modest. Sensory analysis revealed that pretreatments with extracts did not harm organoleptic properties. In fact, treatments with 3 % jujube or barberry, as well as a 5 % combined extract, enhanced taste, texture, and overall acceptability. Health risk assessments confirmed that acrylamide exposure remained below safety thresholds in all samples. In conclusion, pretreating with natural plant extracts like jujube and barberry appears to be a safe, effective, and promising way to reduce acrylamide formation in heat-processed potato products without sacrificing sensory quality.
