In many countries, specialized end-of-life support is offered by hospice. During the transitions to end-of-life care, caregivers play a crucial role in the decision-making and care provision for the persons with dementia. However, caregivers’ experiences regarding the initial entry to hospice have not been comprehensively assessed in the dementia context. Aim: To synthesize qualitative evidence on the caregiver-reported barriers and facilitators to hospice enrollment for persons with dementia. Design: Systematic review and thematic synthesis Data sources: We conducted a systematic literature search across PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus. We considered articles published between 2009 and 2024 that contained qualitative data on hospice entry collected from dementia caregivers. Results: Twenty-two articles met our study eligibility criteria. Five themes were identified: (a) caregivers’ observation and perception of severe stage dementia, (b) whether hospice was the right choice for persons with dementia, (c) burden due to the practical aspects of caregiving, (d) emotions and perception about death and hospice, and (e) guidance and access to hospice. These five themes encompassed 11 facilitators and 15 barriers. Conclusions: Dementia caregivers experience intrapersonal, interpersonal, emotional, logistical, and physical challenges in ensuring quality end-of-life support for their loved one (e.g. limited understanding of end-stage dementia, gatekeeping providers, and family conflicts). The unique needs of caregivers caring for a seriously ill family member with dementia are not being fully addressed by the current available services and policies.

Dementia is now among the leading causes of death worldwide, which calls for specialized support at the end of life. While significant numbers of persons with dementia have high palliative needs, hospice entry may not be guaranteed for all patients who seek it due to strict admission criteria or late referrals. As persons with dementia experience significant decline in functional and cognitive abilities near death, family caregivers are often involved in end-of-life decision-making and care coordination.  What this paper adds? Our findings highlight the uniqueness of dementia in the context of hospice due to the unpredictable and/or prolonged nature of its end-of-life trajectory. Caregivers of persons with dementia experience a variety of emotional, physical, logistical, intrapersonal, and interpersonal challenges as they consider or pursue hospice for their family member. Hospice care models, whether operated under certain eligibility criteria or primarily driven by professionals’ referrals, commonly focus on time-based prognosis of the person with dementia, which does not correspond with how caregivers perceive end-of-life caregiving in severe dementia.  Implications for practice, theory, or policy Integrating a need-based approach to hospice enrollment by regularly assessing caregivers’ burden and their openness to palliative approaches could help better tailor hospice entry for persons with dementia and their families, including end-of-life care, symptom management, and respite. Further research into the specific contexts and available resources that support hospice transition for persons with dementia is warranted to improve the provision of quality end-of-life care for this population. Introduction Dementia is a progressive and terminal illness associated with structural and functional impairments and high symptom burden, especially near death. The World Health Organization estimates more than 55 million persons with dementia worldwide and its impact on society is expanding rapidly.  1  2  3 Hospice upholds the values of compassion and dignity for terminally ill individuals,  4 5 6  7  5  8 9 10 For persons with dementia and their families, hospice can achieve desired outcomes such as care satisfaction, less unmet needs, and better quality of dying. 11 12  13  7  14  15 For persons with dementia, caregivers, namely families or friends providing unpaid care for the individual,  16  17 In the dementia literature, previous reviews synthesized evidence surrounding advanced care planning and caregivers’ hospice experiences. 18 19  20  21 Methods This review adhered to the ENTREQ (enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research) framework as a reporting guideline ( Supplemental Table 1  21 Search strategy and databases We collaborated with an academic librarian at the University of Pennsylvania to determine the search databases and strategies.

Themes and subthemes regarding caregiver-reported barriers and facilitators to hospice enrollment for persons with dementia. Theme 1. Caregivers’ observations and perception of severe stage dementia Specific aspects of severe dementia, as perceived and observed by the caregivers, impacted their pursuit of hospice. 32 35 37 40 47 50 The first facilitator encompassed the signs and symptoms of severe dementia that prompted caregivers to recognize the approaching death of the person with dementia and the need for hospice. These included: being bed-bound and unable to perform independent activities, 34 40 44 45 40 41 47 34 40 37 40 41 34 40  34  37  37  34 disappearing slowly  37  50 a body lying there  44 no real joy, really, in anything anymore  40 worthless, empty, full of suffering and pain  50 However, the ambiguous prognosis of dementia was a main barrier to hospice enrollment. 32 34 35 37 42 44 45 murky term “I view hospice as end-of-life care. But what constitutes end of life?

Whether hospice was the right choice for persons with dementia Caregivers considered the fit between persons with dementia and hospice, 32 38 40 42 44 45 47 50 51 32 34 38 40 44 47 50 “[My sister] called the doctor and said, ‘what can we do to have my mother never go to the hospital again?’  40 40 44 “if she could see herself, she would be mortified  40 34 40 42 44 47 50 So, every meal he would get a white pile, a green pile, and a brown pile. So one day he said to me, ‘Boy, I sure wish I could have toast again!. . .’ And I just said, ‘You know, I don’t care! Give him toast! This is crazy the way we are treating him.  40 The third facilitator was caregivers wanting to respect their loved ones’ wishes against life-prolonging treatment: “ We knew that she wanted to stay at home for as long as possible, she didn’t really want to be in a nursing home and she had agreed to a do not resuscitate form when the GP had spoken to her about that  47 40 47 In contrast, not being aware that hospice is available for persons with dementia served as a barrier. 35 40 47 For the last- just under a year of her life, she had to go into a care facility nursing home because she wasn’t safe to be on her own. . .and I never realized that the hospice actually took patients that had dementia  47 37 41 42 51 Not meeting hospice eligibility was the second barrier among caregivers who sought hospice. 32 36 37 40 44 45 47 all of the criteria  32 could still feed herself  37 wasn’t in the dying phase  47 “there’s really nothing wrong with her. . .I mean she’s been at 72 70 [pounds] for like over a year. . . She doesn’t have any particularly life-threatening issues  45 32 40 44  36 32 44 six months [for hospice], I think was the term she used and I’ve heard some people say three months and that certainly is not adequate. It should be longer  34 The third barrier was the caregivers’ uncertainty regarding whether hospice is the right care model for persons with dementia. Such uncertainty was more evident among those who had experienced hospice discharge, thus being skeptical about the utility of hospice if they cannot maintain eligibility. 44 45 fall[ing] off another cliff  45 I think we have to initiate it [hospice] if we see that there’s a degradation in his quality of life, or some event. It will be a 911 call that probably means that he could be in hospice, which is sort of silly, but that’s what it’s going to have to take  45 “wanting support, but not too much support that would improve the individual’s condition  44 The final barrier was caregivers’ perceptions of long-term or life-sustaining treatment. 32 33 42 50  42 keep him alive  50 keep their brain going as much as they can.”  33  42 it is not for us to decide  50 Theme 3. Burden due to the practical aspects of caregiving The practical burden of end-of-life caregiving had a profound impact on hospice enrollment, 10 32 36 40 42 45 47 50 40 42 45 her physical needs definitely increased. . .the psychosocial and spiritual. . .needs all increased as she became kind of sicker  45 horrendous  40 32 34 36 You’ve got to bring in a team. There is such a thing called hospice.  36 32 42 the differences in choosing just the usual care vs the hospice  42 However, burdensome end-of-life decision-making was a barrier preventing persons with dementia from entering hospice sooner. 32 33 35 40 42 47 50 32 42 32 33 42 47 spiraling out of control  40  50 32 34 40 42 32 34 Theme 4. Emotions and perceptions about death and hospice Caregivers’ feelings and perceptions regarding the potential death of persons with dementia and hospice heavily influenced hospice enrollment. 31 34 36 37 39 41 44 47 49 50 A key facilitator was caregivers accepting that “ the end is near  45 34 39 40 45 I think once he started going down and I could see it, he was gonna die. I knew it. . .  39 live with that  40 be firm in the choice.  47 I’ve said goodbye many years ago  50 I know my wife is gone now, but she’s still here  34 grieve together as a family  44 In contrast, emotional distress, such as being in denial, not being ready, fear, and guilt, served as a barrier delaying hospice enrollment. 32 34 37 39 40 44 46 49 50 While we was getting ready to do hospice, but I was still praying on it, I hadn’t signed any papers yet. . .he was going to go through it, and we was going to talk about it more. . .I was in denial to believe that he was dying  39 in front of you laying in a hospital bed, unable to walk anymore  40 ha[d] no dignified quality of life.  44  33 The fear of losing him is the hardest thing, nothing else is difficult. . . and I’ll do everything in my capability to keep him alive.  50 32 33 49 You feel like you’re killing her by not taking her to the hospital, because that’s just your natural reaction is you want to save somebody.”  40 Initial negative impressions of hospice were also a barrier. 32 36 I wasn’t pleased with the intake person. It—I really didn’t get any sense of, uh, compassion or sincerity,”  32 suppl 3  36 Finally, stigma was a key barrier—associated with both hospice itself and accepting help from others. 31 33 41 45 where a person goes to die  41 hate  31 cruel  32 suppl 3 false sense of her end  45 I didn’t want them to think that I didn’t want to take care of my mom  41 Theme 5. Guidance and access to hospice The final theme relates to caregivers’ experience with receiving guidance and access to hospice 10 31 34 36 43 45 48 51 33 37 41 33 40 33 37 36 43  37  37  47  36 34 37 40 41 33 36 37 39 41 43 45 37 41 42 31 33 42 45 46 51 34 36  33 Nevertheless, not knowing what hospice was or that it was an option for their loved one was a major barrier 31 33 40 46 47 Nobody mentioned the word hospice. Nobody ever said it would be a good idea to look into that now too.  32  40 32 33 40 32 33 36 40 42 46 self-navigating’ through the medical system”  40 anyone to reach out to  42 abandoned  36 When I talked with Hospice she just said to me, ‘You need to make that decision soon and it’s up—you know, we can’t help you with that  32 suppl 3  32  40 Late introduction or referral to hospice was the second barrier, 32 33 37 38 40 51 37 38 40 hopefully they would have been able to provide some. . . stuff. . .but they didn’t have a chance to do it. . . they should have brought in hospice for me earlier  37 Gatekeeping healthcare professionals were also a common barrier. 32 33 37 40 43 47 48 begged them to get her to the hospice several times  47 they [physicians] really didn’t listen  40 It wouldn’t have changed the diagnosis, but it would have changed his end of life in terms of how we would have had conversations and knowing where we were headed.”  43 32 33 37 40 I think they thought I was giving up on him or I didn’t want to give him a chance  37 Logistical or systemic challenges in accessing hospice emerged as the final barrier. 10 32 36 38 46 47 51  47  10  47  32  51  36 32 37 38 32 46 mix-up at the doctor’s office  32 Discussion Main findings Five themes identified from this thematic synthesis emphasize an interplay among caregivers, persons with dementia, and hospice. Hence, involving hospice to provide quality end-of-life care for persons with dementia entails the need to adopt a dementia-specific lens to hospice entry and acknowledge the crucial role dementia caregivers play near death. In hospice, terminal stage is often defined as having a life expectancy of 6 months or less.  13 37 38 40 37 40 34 50 40 44 32 36  47  13  56  57 We also found that healthcare providers, including physicians, nurses, and social workers, acted as both facilitators and barriers to hospice enrollment. In some cases, they informed caregivers about such services and guided them through decision-making processes.  36 32 37  40  48  47 42 45  36 For caregivers living with persons with dementia, alleviating burden associated with constant caregiving was a clear benefit.  42  45 32 50 58 59 40 47 Many caregivers were dissatisfied with their loved ones’ hospitalization, feeling that standard care did not meet end-of-life needs and only provoked trauma. 38 40 44 32 42 32 41  32 We also identified an ongoing need to address the lack of awareness regarding hospice being available for persons with dementia. 35 47 33 37 40 47 60 61 Finally, many persons with dementia receive care in nursing homes or long-term care facilities.  62 39 42  10  7  63 What this study adds There are cross-national variations in the hospice care models, whether they operate under strict eligibility criteria or depend heavily on providers’ referrals. Yet, possibly stemming from the lack of financial and workforce resources, the models commonly focus on time-based terminality and clinical prognosis. For dementia caregivers, this creates a gap between their perception of end-of-life caregiving for severe dementia and the practical reality for receiving resources that could alleviate their burden and offer comfort to their loved one. Applying a dementia-specific lens to the hospice entry phase, while considering caregivers’ needs and openness to palliative approaches, would be beneficial. Moreover, hospice discussions were often reactive, prompted by health crises in persons with dementia. Understanding the unique context that leads to hospice transition during these critical moments would add further insights into facilitating hospice entry for this population. Finally, since challenges may still arise post hospice entry, understanding how dementia caregivers describe their transition to hospice could help identify actionable support that can facilitate the shift to end-of-life care. Strengths and limitations To our knowledge, this is the first study to synthesize qualitative findings to understand what influences hospice entry for persons with dementia from caregivers’ perspectives. We generated dementia-specific themes, highlighting the uniqueness of dementia in hospice. However, due to resource constraints, there are some limitations impacting our methodological rigor, such as the absence of a pre-registered review protocol and the involvement of a single author in the literature screening and quality appraisal. We also excluded gray literature, including dissertations and conference proceedings, which could have added insights to our review. Furthermore, we did not exclude articles that were appraised as low quality, which may introduce bias.  64 58 65 66 Conclusion Caregivers play a pivotal role in managing care and advocating for persons with dementia toward the end of life. However, hospice for persons with dementia is often based on a time-limited prognosis, which may not fully reflect the complex nature of severe dementia and the caregivers’ needs. Tailoring hospice entry to better address the uniqueness of dementia requires ongoing discourse, but it will be imperative to improve end-of-life care for persons with dementia and their families.
