Introduction Radiotherapy, an effective treatment method for many malignancies, continues throughout the cancer treatment process [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 During the apoptosis process, the levels of antioxidant enzymes decrease, while the amount of lipid peroxidation products (such as malondialdehyde) increases [ 7 8 9 10 10 9 11 12 The Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) family, particularly TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, plays an important role in tissue responses after radiation. Following radiation, TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 levels increase, triggering fibrosis, inflammation, and tissue repair processes [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 One of the effective agents in preventing inflammation and oxidative damage caused by radiotherapy is dexmedetomidine [ 20 21 22 23 23 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethical Approval and Animals The current experimental study was conducted with approval from the Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University Animal Experiments Ethics Committee (Rize, Turkey) dated 16 April 2018, numbered 2018/31, and spleen tissues were used in this study. In this experimental study, the experimental procedures were completed in accordance with the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guideline, which aims to increase transparency and accuracy in the reporting of animal experiments. Rats were obtained from the Recep Tayyip Erdoğan University Animal Experiments Application Unit. All rats were kept under hygienic conditions at 55–60% humidity and room temperature (mean 22 °C) and had access to tap water and pellet chow ad libitum. Thirty-two 5-6-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats (340 ± 60 g) were used in the study. The number of rats was determined according to the results of power analysis. Rats were randomly divided into four groups ( n 2.2. Radiotherapy Procedure Ketamine hydrochloride (Ketalar ® ® 19 2.3. Tissue Processing and Histopathological Evaluation Half of the spleen tissue removed from each rat was fixed for immunohistochemical and histological processing. The other half was used for biochemical analyses. The dissected spleen tissues were incubated in 10% formalin solution for 10 days before the fixation process was completed. After being washed overnight in running water, the tissues were dehydrated by rinsing them with graded alcohols (70%, 80%, 96%, and 100%). The tissues were then cleared with xylene and incubated in liquid paraffin at 60 °C to complete the infiltration. Following routine tissue processing, 5-µm-thick sections were obtained from paraffin-embedded sections using a microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were evaluated using the CellSens Entry software, version 1.18 (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) on a light microscope equipped with a camera (Olympus, BX43, Center Valley, PA, USA). White pulp diameter was measured using the planimetric method in the histopathological images obtained from each section (cellSens Entry microscope software program, Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA). The diameter of the follicles in each image was measured, and the average was calculated. Histopathological scoring was based on a category showing an ordered progression: 0—absent, 1—mild, 2—moderate, 3—severe. 2.4. Immunohistochemical Analyses 4 µm-thick sections from paraffin blocks were stained with primary antibodies against anti-TGF-β1 (ab66043, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, dilution: 1/100), anti-TGF-β3 (ab15537, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, dilution: 1/100), and anti-Caspase 3 (ab4051, Abcam, USA, dilution: 1/300). A mouse-specific HRP-AEC kit (ab93705, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for staining. Mayer’s hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. A camera-mounted microscope (Olympus, BX43, Center Valley, PA, USA) was used to obtain images of the sections. A semi-quantitative scoring method was used to evaluate immunoreactivity in all groups: Reactions were graded as “mild,” “modified,” or “strong” based on staining intensity. Positive reactions were scored as “%.” [ 22 2.5. Biochemical Tissue Sampling and Homogenization For biochemical analyses, spleen tissues were removed, washed with saline solution, and stored at −80 °C. A mixture of 1 L of 20 mM sodium phosphate and 140 mM potassium chloride was prepared for tissue homogenization (pH 7.4). After 100 mg of tissue sample was added to 1 mL of the resulting homogenization solution, it was centrifuged at 800× g 24 25 26 2 4 2.6. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses of the data were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 10.2, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Numerical data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess whether the data were normally distributed. One-way analysis of variance (One-way ANOVA) was used to determine the differences between normally distributed groups, and Tukey’s post hoc test was used to determine which groups had significant differences. For data that did not show normal distribution, comparisons between groups were made using the Kruskal–Wallis test. A p 3. Results 3.1. Histopathological Findings In sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, the spleen in the control group maintained its normal histological organization, and the white pulp areas were prominent and rounded ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 p Figure 1 According to histopathological scoring results, significant morphological changes were observed in the spleen tissue in the radiotherapy (RT) group compared to the control group. The fibrosis score in the white pulp increased significantly in the RT group ( p p p p p p p p p Figure 2 Figure 3 3.2. Immunohistochemical Findings When the percentage of mildly positive cells for anti-caspase-3 immunoreactivity in the red pulp was evaluated, no significant difference was observed between groups ( Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 3 Figure 4 p Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 3 Figure 4 p Figure 3 Figure 4 p p Figure 3 Figure 4 Additionally, no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of the percentage of mildly anti-TGFβ1 immunopositive cells in the red pulp ( Figure 5 Figure 6 p p p Figure 5 Figure 6 p p p p Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 5 Figure 6 p p p Figure 5 Figure 6 p p Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 5 When anti-TGF-β3 immunoreactivity was examined, the percentage of TGF-β3-positive cells in the red pulp showed a significant increase in strong positivity in the RT-D100 group compared to control group ( p Figure 7 Figure 8 p Figure 7 Figure 8 p Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 7 Figure 8 p p Figure 7 Figure 8 p p Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 7 3.3.

Discussion Radiotherapy, an effective option in cancer treatment, has various side effects due to the penetration of ionizing radiation into the tissues [ 27 28 29 30 31 24 Histopathological results revealed a decrease in white pulp diameter in the RT-D200 group. This reduction in white pulp diameter may be a marker of decreased immune response capacity [ 32 33 21 34 Apoptosis is an important cascade of processes involved in the homeostasis of organs and tissues; it also plays an active regulatory role in the maturation of T and B lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid organs after antigen recognition [ 35 36 37 38 When the findings of our study regarding anti-TGF-β1 were examined, it was determined that the expression of TGF-β1, a fibrogenic cytokine important against radiation-induced tissue damage, in the red and white pulp was increased in the treatment groups compared to the RT group. While some studies in the literature provide evidence that dexmedetomidine suppresses TGF-β1 [ 39 TGF-β3 is a multifunctional cytokine that participates in many physiological processes, such as cell cycle regulation, immune regulation, and fibrogenesis. It is known that ionizing radiation used in cancer treatment affects many cells’ signaling pathways. One of these pathways is related to TGF-β3 [ 12 40 41 42 43 44 45 13 The immunomodulatory feature of dexmedetomidine, one of the important targets of modern drug therapy, is the result of being a member of the alpha 2 receptor family, which is a member of the adrenergic receptor family [ 22 46 47 48 The main limitation of our study is that we did not assess apoptosis in immune cells using TUNEL staining. Caspase-3, which indicates that the cell has entered the apoptotic pathway, could have been a complementary approach to the TUNEL method, which indicates the late phase of apoptosis. More molecular studies are needed regarding the effects of radiation on the immune system. Another limitation of our study is the absence of a dexmedetomidine-only group. Since the main purpose of the study was to investigate the potential protective effect of dexmedetomidine against radiation-induced immune system damage, including such a group, was beyond the scope of the current design. Furthermore, given the existence of several studies on the protective effects of dexmedetomidine, we aimed to minimize the number of animals used, in accordance with the 3R (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) principles. Future molecular studies on the effects of dexmedetomidine alone at the cellular level are needed to further clarify its independent effects. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study demonstrates that histological damage and oxidative stress induced by radiotherapy in spleen tissue can be alleviated in a dose-dependent manner with dexmedetomidine. High-dose dexmedetomidine (200 µg/kg) appears to be more effective in reducing radiation-induced apoptosis, signs of fibrosis, and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that dexmedetomidine may be a potential protective agent in preventing radiation-associated immune damage.
