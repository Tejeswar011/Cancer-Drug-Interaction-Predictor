Total joint reconstruction (TJR) is essential for the management of end-stage temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Current reconstruction techniques include the use of autologous grafts, such as chondrocostal tissue or fibula, and alloplastic TMJ replacement systems. Commercially available TMJ replacement systems provide both stock and customized prostheses. Advances in computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing technology, three-dimensional printing, and virtual surgical planning have accelerated the trend toward individualized TMJ prostheses, enhancing anatomical adaptation, intraoperative efficiency, and postoperative outcomes. A promising alternative under preclinical investigation is TMJ tissue engineering, a regenerative approach utilizing scaffolds, stem cells, and growth factors to reconstruct specific TMJ components, including the skeletal condyle, fibrocartilaginous disc, and glenoid fossa. Bioprinting has further transformed the field by enabling the creation of complex, multi-tissue structures with cellular viability and functionality. Techniques such as integrated tissue and organ printing and volumetric printing have shown promise for enhancing graft performance by improving scaffold heterogeneity. However, these advanced approaches remain in the preclinical stage and require critical evaluation before clinical translation. Despite these advancements, challenges such as high costs, technical complexities, and the need for extensive, robust datasets persist.

Created with Adobe Illustrator (Version 29.6, Adobe Inc., San Jose, California, United States). Illustration of a human skull profile with a detailed inset of the temporomandibular joint. Labels include articular eminence, inferior and superior articular cavities, lateral pterygoid, glenoid fossa, articular disc, retrodiscal lamina, and mandibular condyle. Modern strategies for TMJ reconstruction integrate diverse surgical techniques, including revascularized tissue transfers, costochondral grafting, and alloplastic TMJ replacement. The choice of procedure depends on several patient-specific factors, such as age, underlying pathology, skeletal maturity, and the risk of compromising the contralateral joint’s function ( Imola and Liddell, 2016 Pedersen et al., 2021 Borbon et al., 2023 Ko et al., 1999 Awal et al., 2018 Alba et al., 2024 Sinn et al., 2021 Hashemi et al., 2024 Over recent decades, the development and application of alloplastic materials, along with advances in tissue-engineered solutions, have significantly expanded the options for TMJ replacement ( Salash et al., 2016 In the era of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), three-dimensional (3D) printing, and virtual surgical planning (VSP), TMJ reconstruction has undergone significant advancements. As a result, patient-specific TMJ prostheses designed through VSP have become a widely established approach, continuously undergoing refinements. Future perspectives focus on tissue engineering and bioprinting of TMJ tissues, offering the potential for biomimetic innovations. However, these technologies remain in preclinical stages and should be critically evaluated. Furthermore, initial efforts have been made to integrate augmented reality and virtual reality into the field of TMJ surgery. These technologies provide preoperative support for condylar resection planning, prosthesis selection, and the identification of potential interferences. Additionally, they offer intraoperative real-time guidance for osteotomies, prosthesis placement, screw fixation, and occlusion verification ( Niloy et al., 2024 Despite these advancements, there remains a scarcity of comprehensive studies that condense the latest innovations in TMJ surgery. This research gap leaves untapped potential to leverage recent findings to improve TMJ patient care. To fill this research gap, this review aims to provide an encompassing overview of the recent developments in TMJ reconstruction and distill the most promising research findings. State of the art–established techniques in TMJ reconstruction Virtual surgical planning Early TMJ surgery relied on manually shaping autologous grafts, such as costochondral or fibula free flaps, guided by anatomical landmarks and refined through intraoperative adjustments ( Wax et al., 2000 Munro and Chir, 1980 Wax et al., 2000 Raccampo et al., 2023 Myers et al., 2021 Rodby et al., 2014 Hadad et al., 2023 In current clinical workflows, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans are used to capture bony anatomy, in select cases supplemented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for visualization of soft tissues and vascular structures. These datasets are imported as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files into dedicated surgical planning software (e.g., Mimics, Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium), where they are co-registered within a unified coordinate system to ensure accurate anatomical alignment. Using semi-automated or AI-assisted segmentation tools, individual anatomical regions, particularly the TMJ, are isolated and converted into 3D surface files (e.g., STL format). In subsequent design platforms (e.g., 3-matic, Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium), osteotomy lines are defined, either as simple planar cuts or complex freeform curves, based on the clinical scenario. Prosthetic components are virtually designed, often in collaboration between biomedical engineers and surgeons, and adjusted according to anatomical landmarks and resection planes. Surgical guides for osteotomies and drilling are then modeled within the same planning environment and manufactured via 3D printing using biocompatible materials. These guides are typically aligned with the planned implant trajectory to ensure congruent intraoperative placement. Additionally, anatomical models of the mandible and prosthetic replicas may be printed to assist with surgical rehearsal and intraoperative reference. All components are thoroughly sterilized and quality-controlled prior to clinical use, enabling accurate, reproducible execution of the preoperative plan ( Raccampo et al., 2023 Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Workflow of VSP and CAD/CAM-based fabrication of TMJ prostheses. Created with BioRender (BioRender Inc., Toronto, Canada). Abbreviations: CAD/CAM. computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing, VSP: virtual surgical planning. A seven-step process illustrating prosthetic design and surgical planning: 1. Imaging and 3D reconstruction with CT/CBCT scans. 2. VSP and resection simulation. 3. CAD design of prosthetic components. 4. Digital motion analysis. 5. Design and fabrication of surgical guides. 6. Final prosthesis manufacturing. 7. Surgical implementation and follow-up. Each step includes specific technical details for creating accurate models and ensuring precise surgical outcomes. The integration of VSP with personalized CAD/CAM-produced devices was initially designed to enhance efficiency and support surgeons in TMJ reconstruction. This approach offers i) reduced surgical time, ii) improved accuracy through cutting and placement guides and precalculated contact surfaces, iii) enhanced aesthetic results iv) visualization of patient-specific anatomical variations before and during surgery, and v) precise margins in tumor resection scenarios prior to TMJ reconstruction ( del Castillo Pardo de Vera et al., 2024 Mian et al., 2021 Dowgierd et al., 2021 Mian et al., 2021 Neuhaus et al., 2021 A study by Sawh-Martinez et al. evaluated the position of the condyle following mandibular reconstruction using CT imaging. The comparison between mandibular reconstructions with and without VSP demonstrated that VSP significantly improved precision, particularly by reducing superior and lateral shifts of the ipsilateral condyle, as well as minimizing changes in the condylar and condylar neck angles ( Sawh-Martinez et al., 2017 Current TMJ alloplastic replacement systems Several commercially available TMJ replacement systems exist, including the Zimmer Biomet Microfixation System (Jacksonville, United States), patient-specific TMJ Concepts by Stryker (Ventura, United States), Materialise’s custom-made TMJ Total Arthroplasty System (Leuven, Belgium), and IPS Implants® by KLS Martin (Tuttlingen, Germany). The Zimmer Biomet system offers both stock and customized prostheses, while the TMJ replacement systems by TMJ Concepts, Materialise, and KLS Martin are exclusively patient-specific ( Kanatsios et al., 2018 Jones, 2011 Materialise, 2023 KLS Martin Group, 2024 Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2016 Olate et al., 2023 Abramowicz et al., 2012 On the other hand, customized prostheses offered by all the mentioned manufacturers provide the benefits of patient-specific designs, enabling simplified intraoperative workflows, reduced bone modification, and enhanced precision in fitting ( Mercuri, 2013 Zheng et al., 2019 All four systems are two-component designs consisting of a mandibular condyle and a glenoid fossa. The mandibular components of the Zimmer Biomet (stock/customized), TMJ Concepts, and Materialise systems comprise a cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) alloy condylar head and a titanium alloy body, which is either entirely composed of titanium or features a plasma-sprayed titanium coating ( Materialise, 2023 KLS Martin Group, 2024 Giannakopoulos et al., 2012 Aagaard and Thygesen, 2014 KLS Martin Group, 2024 Granquist et al., 2018 Materialise, 2023 KLS Martin Group, 2024 Giannakopoulos et al., 2012 Aagaard and Thygesen, 2014 Materialise, 2023 KLS Martin Group, 2024 Brown et al., 2016 Sembronio et al., 2021 The stock Zimmer Biomet System received full approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005 and represents a well-established option in TMJ reconstruction, with available long-term outcomes ( Giannakopoulos et al., 2012 In contrast, the systems by Materialise and KLS Martin are relatively recent advancements. Consequently, long-term studies and robust evidence-based data for these systems are currently lacking. Notably, there exists a retrospective study on customized TMJ prostheses by Engimplan/Materialise Company (Rio Claro, Brazil), evaluating 22 patients over 2 years ( Leandro et al., 2022 Materialise, 2023 KLS Martin Group, 2024 A summary of the materials used in alloplastic TMJ replacement systems is provided in Table 1 TABLE 1 Summary of materials used in different alloplastic TMJ replacement systems.

Alloplastic vs. autologous reconstruction Before the advent of TMJ alloplastic replacement systems, and in cases where such implants are contraindicated, autologous TMJ reconstruction was, and continues to be, the preferred method. The most commonly used grafting tissues include costochondral grafts, sternoclavicular grafts, and free fibula grafts ( Sidebottom, 2013 Complications associated with costochondral grafts are reported in 51%–58% of patients and include infection, facial nerve weakness, malocclusion, and graft fracture due to overload. Especially, (re)ankylosis and graft overgrowth represent common issues ( Awal et al., 2018 Sidebottom, 2013 Saeed et al., 2003 Saeed et al., 2003 Sidebottom, 2013 Sekhoto et al., 2019 TMJ reconstructions using sternoclavicular grafts have been associated with complications such as joint ankylosis, foreign body giant cell reaction, graft destruction or fracture, and donor site morbidity, including clavicle fractures. Graft survival rates were 50% in patients with inflammatory TMJ pathology but reached 93% in those without inflammatory conditions or prior alloplastic TMJ reconstruction ( Wolford et al., 1994 Reconstruction of the mandibular condyle using a fibula free flap is predominantly performed in cases of mandibulectomy involving the condyle. Wax et al. reported postoperative fibular head displacement out of the fossa in 12% of cases, hypoperfusion of the graft requiring a second venous anastomosis in 6%, and asymptomatic bone exposure in 6% ( Wax et al., 2000 Wax et al., 2000 Gravvanis et al., 2017 Powers et al., 2022 Rendenbach et al., 2016 In clinical practice, alloplastic TMJ prostheses are the primary choice for TMJ replacement or reconstruction. The literature indicates low rates of removal and revision for these devices. Amarista et al. reported revision rates of 3% for patient-specific TMJ Concepts prostheses, 3% for stock Zimmer Biomet prostheses, and 2% for custom Zimmer Biomet prostheses ( Amarista et al., 2020 Gerbino et al., 2024 Adverse events associated with alloplastic TMJ replacements include infection, nerve injuries (i.e., facial nerve, trigeminal nerve), neuropathic pain, and hearing disturbances, with an overall incidence of 5%–19% ( Aagaard and Thygesen, 2014 Neff et al., 2020 Peres Lima et al., 2023 Neff et al., 2020 Rajkumar and Sidebottom, 2022 Sanovich et al., 2014 Handa et al., 2023 Neff et al., 2020 Implant survival rates are high, with a 2024 meta-analysis reporting a 97% survival rate over follow-up periods ranging from 12 months to 21 years ( Lima et al., 2024 Wolford et al., 2015 Table 2 TABLE 2 Comparison of the different options for TMJ reconstruction.

TMJ replacement in children Reconstruction of the TMJ in children presents a unique clinical challenge. The most common underlying conditions necessitating TMJ reconstruction include congenital deformities, neoplasms, ankylosis, and progressive resorptive diseases ( Resnick, 2018 Resnick, 2018 Pluijmers et al., 2014 Ko et al., 1999 Awal et al., 2018 Resnick, 2018 Awal et al., 2018 Yang et al., 2015 Alba et al., 2024 Sinn et al., 2021 Hashemi et al., 2024 Keyser et al., 2020 Awal et al., 2018 A recent survey of 14 pediatric patients treated with customized alloplastic TMJ prostheses reported only two postoperative complications requiring surgical intervention: one infection and one case of heterotopic ossification. Bilateral reconstruction was performed in nine cases, and unilateral reconstruction in five. All patients demonstrated improved mandibular function, increased maximum interincisal opening (MIO), and no evidence of asymmetrical growth ( Keyser et al., 2020 Novel innovations and future perspectives Total joint replacement Total joint replacement is required in cases of end-stage TMJ disorders and involves the surgical replacement of the TMJ with an alloplastic prosthesis ( Neff et al., 2020 Yadav et al., 2021 Yadav et al., 2021 Research is increasingly focused on optimizing accurate fitting by customized joint prostheses to restore optimal functions. A study by Ingawale et al. introduced a patient-specific TMJ prosthesis with novel features designed to enhance adaptation to each patient’s anatomic conditions. The surgeon can customize the shape and center of rotation of the condylar head, with the design being precisely adapted to the load-bearing conditions. The prosthesis incorporates perforated notches that extend into the host bone at implantation. The glenoid fossa design facilitates sufficient rotation and allows for anterior-posterior and medio-lateral translation. A modified design, featuring a rectangular slot with curved anterior and posterior edges and circumferential stabilization for the condylar head, ensures accurate fitting on the skeletal surface. Consequently, this study demonstrates that the introduced approach holds promise for stable total TMJ reconstruction, validated under both functional/normal and para-functional/worst-case TMJ loading scenarios ( Ingawale and Goswami, 2022 De Meurechy et al. developed an innovative, patient-specific 3D-printed titanium alloy TMJ replacement system designed to restore laterotrusive movements through the reinsertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Utilizing a sheep model, the study evaluated the efficacy of a HadSat® diamond-like carbon (H-DLC) coating for the condylar head, combined with a machined UHMWPE fossa component enriched with Vitamin E and subjected to γ-irradiation. The findings advocate for the combined use of H-DLC-coated titanium for the condyle and Vitamin E-stabilized UHMWPE for the fossa as a superior option for TMJ implant systems ( De Meurechy et al., 2022 In a sheep model, another research group investigated a novel, customized TMJ prosthesis that permits the reinsertion and integration of the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) into the prosthesis. This approach aimed to preserve LPM function and reduce excessive load on the contralateral joint through optimized load distribution. The methodology involved preserving the LPM enthesis and reattaching it to a scaffold at the condylar neck of the TMJ prosthesis. Again, an H-DLC coating was applied to the condylar head. Histological analysis demonstrated a functional fibrotic reintegration of the LPM onto the prosthesis, thereby successfully restoring muscle function ( Mommaerts et al., 2025 Tissue engineering–the future of TMJ reconstruction? Tissue engineering for TMJ reconstruction focuses on three components: i) the skeletal condyle, ii) the fibrocartilaginous disc, and iii) the glenoid fossa and articular eminence ( Aryaei et al., 2016 Acri et al., 2019 Acri et al., 2019 Biological scaffolds which can be used for the reconstruction of the articular disc include decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) sheets, fibrin, collagen, and chitosan ( Acri et al., 2019 Singh et al., 2022 Vapniarsky et al., 2018 Various cell types can be used to seed these scaffolds, comprising stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and differentiated chondrocytes ( Acri et al., 2019 Zhao et al., 2024 Growth factors prominently used in articular disc engineering include transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) ( Johns and Athanasiou, 2008 Kalpakci et al., 2011 In an in vitro Yi et al., 2021 For mandibular condyle engineering, scaffolds can include the mentioned synthetic materials but also mineralized components like hydroxyapatite (HA) ( Ciocca et al., 2013 Konopnicki and Troulis, 2015 Acri et al., 2019 Howlader et al., 2017 Konopnicki and Troulis, 2015 Grayson et al., 2010 Engineering the glenoid fossa poses significant challenges due to its complex morphology and cartilage-bone interface. Notably, only few studies have addressed this aspect ( Aryaei et al., 2016 Acri et al., 2019 A summary of materials for tissue engineering is presented in Table 3 Acri et al. (2019) TABLE 3 Summary of materials for tissue engineering different parts of the TMJ.

Regenerative treatments using stem cells have demonstrated promising outcomes in the management of degenerative TMJ disorders, showing significant chondrogenic regenerative potential ( De et al., 2019 Köhnke et al., 2021 Matheus et al., 2022 Zhang et al., 2015 Recent advancements in 3D printing Bioprinting represents a cutting-edge development in tissue engineering, advancing the scope of reconstructive surgery by enabling the production of intricate, multi-tissue structures with cellular viability intact. Rooted in the principles of three-dimensional printing, bioprinting integrates living cells, biomaterials, and bioactive compounds into precise, layer-by-layer arrangements to mimic native anatomical tissues ( Ramadan and Zourob, 2021 Bishop et al., 2017 Other more sophisticated biofabrication techniques, permitting a fast processing in volume and permitting the use of hydrogel-precursors with undesirable rheological properties to be extruded, should be considered in the future to produce such kind of complex structures, including digital-light processing or volumetric 3D printing ( Li et al., 2023 Rodríguez-Pombo et al., 2022 Reconstruction of the TMJ is challenging due to the structural diversity and biomechanical demands. Bioprinting offers a promising approach, enabling precise customization of each TMJ component to address these complexities effectively. Particularly, bioprinting of fibrocartilaginous tissue for the TMJ holds promising future prospects, driven by ongoing research into cartilage bioprinting techniques, including scaffold-based, scaffold-free, and in situ Wu et al., 2021 Hu et al., 2023 Perera et al., 2021 Helgeland et al. explored the use of genipin-crosslinked 3D-printed gelatin scaffolds as a promising platform for regenerating TMJ cartilage. Their findings highlighted the ability of these bioprinted scaffolds to enhance the attachment, survival, and chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). This demonstrates the scaffolds’ potential for supporting cartilage tissue engineering in TMJ repair and regeneration applications ( Helgeland et al., 2021 Advanced printing methods, such as integrated tissue and organ printing (ITOP), allow for the simultaneous deposition of multiple bioinks (i.e., a combination of hydrogels, cellular components, and bioactive additives) to create composite tissues ( Gungor-Ozkerim et al., 2018 Park et al., 2022 Kang et al., 2016 Park et al., 2022 Despite its potential, bioprinting for TMJ reconstruction remains in a translational phase, with limited clinical application and minimal progress in animal models. Currently, only a few bioprinted tissues, such as dermal, skeletal, cartilagous, or hepatical tissue, have been successfully transplanted into animals ( Yang et al., 2021 Di Bella et al., 2018 Alawi et al., 2023 Hu et al., 2023 Salah et al., 2020 Keriquel et al., 2017 Apelgren et al., 2019 Figure 3 FIGURE 3 Graphical abstract presenting future perspectives in TMJ surgery. Created with BioRender (BioRender Inc., Toronto, Canada). Abbreviations: CAD/CAM. computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing, TMJ: temporomandibular joint. Future perspectives for TMJ prostheses include 3D printing, CAD/CAM for customized scaffolds, and bioprinting for precise component customization. Tissue engineering combines scaffolds, cells, and growth factors for reconstruction. Benefits include accuracy and reduced operative time, while challenges involve technical complexity and costs. Tissue-engineered TMJ components in the growing patient As a forward-looking approach, tissue-engineered TMJ components represent a promising biological alternative, particularly in pediatric patients. Several studies have demonstrated the successful implantation of tissue-engineered organs in growing children. For example, in 2012, Elliott et al. reported the implantation of a tissue-engineered trachea in a 12-year-old patient, which remained functional and demonstrated growth compatibility over a 2-year follow-up period ( Elliott et al., 2012 Sugiura et al., 2018 Ott, 2012 Approval pathways and ethical challenges The FDA approval process for alloplastic TMJ devices follows the medical device regulatory pathway, typically requiring premarket approval (PMA) due to their classification as Class III devices, which involves rigorous evaluation of safety, efficacy, and long-term performance through clinical trials. Manufacturers must submit extensive data, including biocompatibility, mechanical testing, and clinical study outcomes ( FDA, 2021 NIH SEED, 2023 Nordberg et al., 2022 The use of alloplastic and tissue-engineered TMJ reconstruction in pediatric patients raises ethical concerns related to growth compatibility, long-term safety, and consent. Alloplastic devices may require multiple revision surgeries over a lifetime, while tissue-engineered constructs remain experimental with limited longitudinal data ( Laventhal et al., 2012 PREP, 2024 Discussion Recent advances in digital simulation and additive manufacturing have catalyzed a paradigm shift in TMJ reconstruction. Customized alloplastic prostheses, enabled by VSP, have markedly improved both functional and aesthetic outcomes, while emerging regenerative strategies such as tissue engineering and bioprinting offer promising new directions. However, the benefits, limitations, and current challenges associated with these innovations must be critically evaluated. The integration of VSP has significantly advanced TMJ reconstruction by shifting from conventional freehand techniques to precise, patient-specific approaches. Digital simulations and 3D-printed guides have streamlined operative procedures and enhanced the accuracy of graft shaping and prosthetic placement, thereby improving both functional and aesthetic outcomes ( del Castillo Pardo de Vera et al., 2024 Mian et al., 2021 Dowgierd et al., 2021 Esmaeelinejad and Sohrabi, 2015 While all four of the mentioned TMJ replacement systems (i.e., Zimmer Biomet, TMJ Concepts, KLS Martin, and Materialise) offer customized devices with similar components and materials, subtle differences persist ( Materialise, 2023 KLS Martin Group, 2024 Giannakopoulos et al., 2012 Aagaard and Thygesen, 2014 Historically, autologous reconstruction was the mainstay for TMJ replacement. However, the significant complications and donor site morbidity associated with autologous grafts have driven the shift toward alloplastic prostheses, which generally exhibit lower complication and revision rates along with high survival outcomes ( Wax et al., 2000 Sidebottom, 2013 Saeed et al., 2003 Amarista et al., 2020 Pedersen et al., 2021 Borbon et al., 2023 Recent advances in additive manufacturing have further refined these alloplastic TMJ replacement devices. For instance, approximately 27% of metal TMJ components are now produced using 3D printing, with this technology poised to dominate the future of patient-specific devices ( Mercuri et al., 2022 Mercuri et al., 2022 Leuders et al., 2015 Tammas-Williams et al., 2017 Innovative regenerative strategies have further broadened the scope of TMJ reconstruction. Tissue engineering offers a promising alternative to conventional options by leveraging advanced scaffolds, diverse cell types, and growth factors to replicate native anatomical structures and restore function ( Acri et al., 2019 in vivo Donahue et al., 2019 Santos et al., 2018 Deus et al., 2020 In this context, bioprinting naturally emerges as a complementary extension of tissue-engineered approaches, offering the capacity to precisely position cells, biomaterials, and bioactive compounds within three-dimensional constructs. The integration of bioprinting into TMJ reconstruction holds the potential to revolutionize maxillofacial surgery by reducing donor site morbidity, decreasing operative time, and enhancing graft performance ( Salah et al., 2020 Gaspar et al., 2020 Ribezzi et al., 2023 Ainsworth et al., 2023 Ejiohuo, 2023 in vitro Amarista et al., 2020 Gerbino et al., 2024 Rajkumar and Sidebottom, 2022 Leandro et al., 2013 Rajkumar and Sidebottom, 2022 Wolford et al., 2015 TMJ reconstruction has seen transformative advancements through digital technologies such as VSP and additive manufacturing, enabling highly accurate, patient-specific alloplastic prostheses. However, three major challenges remain: the lack of growth adaptability in pediatric patients, material and mechanical limitations in 3D-printed implants, and the translational barriers facing regenerative strategies. Emerging technologies, such as 4D bioprinting, gene therapy, and bottom-up tissue engineering, offer promising solutions by enabling dynamic, biologically integrated constructs that can better replicate the complexity of the native joint. To realize these innovations clinically, interdisciplinary collaboration between engineers, surgeons, and biologists is essential, alongside rigorous preclinical testing and ethically sound clinical trials, especially in pediatric populations.
