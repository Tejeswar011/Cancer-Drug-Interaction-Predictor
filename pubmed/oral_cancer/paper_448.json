T-cells and melanoma cells play crucial role in shaping the tumor microenvironment, yet their role and impact on prognosis in melanoma is still unclear. Methods We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for melanoma ( GSE200218 GSE215121 GSE65904 Results Our analysis revealed specific T-cell and melanoma subpopulations influencing melanoma prognosis, validated in an independent cohort. Notably, our study was the first to identify MITF + T-cell and M2-cell sub-populations associated with melanoma prognosis. Using 108 prognostic gene markers, we stratified TCGA-SKCM patients into two groups with distinct clinical outcomes, immune cell scores, and carcinogenic profiles. Additionally, we employed 72 machine-learning algorithm combinations to develop a consensus prognosis model based on 174 DEGs from the two prognosis-related subgroups. Ultimately, we created a novel PRS model using 11 genes, which demonstrated accurate prognostic predictive ability in the GSE65904 Conclusions This study identified MITF + T-cells and M2-cells as key factors in melanoma prognosis and developed a novel PRS model for accurate prediction. These findings could help guide clinical decision-making for melanoma patients.

Surgical intervention combined with immunotherapy and targeted therapies has significantly improved the survival rate of patients with melanoma [ 3 6 Tumor, stromal and immune cells coexist in a complex ecology called the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) [ 7 8 9 10 11 TIME profoundly affects T-cell function, which plays a pivotal role in antitumor immune response [ 12 14 15 17 18 The utilization of single-cell sequencing data has expedited the comprehension of melanoma. In melanoma, scRNA-Seq has emerged as a pivotal tool for identifying rare cell subpopulations, deciphering immune evasion mechanisms, and uncovering transcriptional programs driving therapeutic resistance. Studies by Tirosh et al. and Veatch et al. utilized scRNA-Seq to map the immunosuppressive landscape of melanoma, revealing critical roles of CD4 + T cell subsets and stromal interactions in disease progression [ 19 20 21 22 Inspired by these studies, we attempted to illustrate the prognostic T and melanoma cell subpopulations and to develop a prognostic risk score (PRS) model to predict the prognosis of melanoma based on these subpopulations-related genes. Thus, we utilized scRNA-seq to identify specific T and melanoma subpopulations that impact prognosis in melanoma patients, which was also verified in the validation dataset. We stratified patients into two subtypes based on prognosis-related genes and constructed a new PRS model using the subtype-specific differentially expressed genes, which was also verified in the validation dataset. This study may provide a new perspective for predicting the prognosis of patients with melanoma. Materials and methods Data collection Single-cell RNA sequencing profiles were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GSE200218 GSE215121 https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ GSE65904 scRNA-seq data analysis The analysis of scRNA-seq data was carried out using the Seurat package (v4.4.0). For cell clustering, the “FindClusters” and “FindNeighbors” functions were applied with parameters set to dim = 30 and resolution = 0.8. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the “RunUMAP” function in Seurat. Cell annotation and subtype visualization were based on the expression patterns of specific marker genes for various T-cell types. Batch effect correction was handled through Seurat’s rpca during sample integration with dims = 1:30. Additionally, a secondary clustering phase was performed with dim = 20 and resolution = 0.5, focusing on T and melanoma cells to assess the diversity of these cell subpopulations. To gain a better understanding of how T- and melanoma cell subpopulations correlate with the prognosis of the patients, we used Scissor (v2.0.0, alpha = 0.05) to link single-cell data with survival data via TCGA-SKCM bulk RNA-Seq sample. Based on the survival data, we identified T- and melanoma cells correlation with with prognosis in the GSE215121 GSE200218 Identification of the specific gene markers The “Seurat” R package’s “FindAllMarkers” function (with parameters logfc.threshold = 0.7 and only.pos = TRUE) was employed to identify signature hallmark genes (SHGs) in both survival-positive and survival-negative cells. For the subsequent molecular subtype analysis of melanoma, we used the 108 genes that were common to both the GSE215121 GSE200218 Additionally, we identified 1883 and 613 shared SHGS between the GSE215121 GSE200218 Constructing consensus clustering based on 108 prognostic genes The FactoMineR (2.9) R package uses the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm to perform the principal component analysis (PCA). Using 108 shared genes, consensus clustering was carried out on the TCGA-SKCM dataset using the ConsensusClusterPlus (1.62.0) R package(Clustering algorithm: k-means). We selected an optimum k value in consideration for stability and clustering performance. A suitable k = 2 was chosen based on consensus CDF and delta area. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained between two subtypes using “limma” R package, with |logFC|>=1 and adj.P.Val < 0.05. For assessment of the clinical performance of the two subtypes, we examined the differences in patient prognosis as well as other clinical characteristics, such as ESTIMATE score, immune score, stromal score and tumor immune cell infiltrations. Development and validation of PRS model Univariate Cox analysis was conducted on the DEGs using the coxph function from the survival package, that led to identification of 174 prognosis-related genes (p-value < 0.01). To develop a consensus prognostic risk score (PRS) model, we integrated 8 classical algorithms (random forest i.e. RFS, LASSO COX, GBM, ridge regression, CoxBoost, Stepback Cox, Stepboth Cox, and elastic network i.e. Enet) into a combinations of 72 different machine-learning algorithms, where Enet is divided into 3 classifiers according to the α-index. The TCGA-SKCM dataset was randomly divided into training and testing cohort, with GSE65904 To assess the predictive value of the PRS model, melanoma patients were divided into high-PRS and low-PRS groups based on the median risk score. Receivers operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated, and the area under curve (AUC) was calculated using the R package pROC (v1.18.5). Using Kaplan-Meier curves, we generated the survfit function from survival (v3.5.8) package. KM curves were to evaluate overall survival differences between high- and low-PRS groups.

To explore this further, we identified 1,883 shared signature hallmark genes (SHGs) of MITF + T-cells from both the GSE215121 GSE200218 2 Identification of melanoma cell subpopulations by single-cell analysis Prior investigations also reported that melanoma cells critically regulated melanoma progression of melanoma metastasis [ 19 GSE200218 3 3 3 3 GSE215121 3 3 3 GSE215121  Fig. 3 Identification of melanoma cell subpopulations by single-cell analysis.

Our findings confirmed the presence of MITF + T and M2 subpopulations, both of which are linked to the prognosis, using single-cell data supported by phenotypic guidance from bulk data. These results may contribute to the development of targeted cell therapies and the identification of reliable prognostic markers. Additionally, we identified 77 and 31 SHGs from the survival + and survival- cells, respectively (Fig. 4  Fig. 4 Establishment of 2 subcategories based on prognostic genes.

A B C D E F Discussion Melanoma is a complex and aggressive tumor characterized by highly diverse genetic patterns and a poor prognosis. As new treatment methods for melanoma continue to emerge, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and reliable approach for monitoring its prognosis. Recently, studies have documented the relevance of immune cell subpopulations and associated genes with the prognosis of various cancers, including melanoma [ 13 14 18 32 TIME has a crucial impact on tumor immunotherapy, which in turn affects the survival of cancer patients [ 17 33 34 35 GSE200218 GSE215121 Smalley et al. reported that single-cell sequencing analysis showed that melanoma cell populations account for a large proportion of brain metastasis samples derived from melanoma patients. They also found that melanoma cell populations are the most diverse, with cells from individual melanoma patients forming distinct clusters, whereas other cell subtypes from different patients tend to cluster together [ 36 18 GSE200218 GSE215121 Given the limited research on the antitumor immune effects related to T-cells and melanoma subpopulations, our study is the first attempt to identify specific T-cell and melanoma subpopulations that can serve as predictors of melanoma prognosis. We first obtained 108 specific highly expressed genes related to prognosis of T and melanoma cell populations from the GSE215121 GSE200218 GSE65904 To our knowledge, nine out of the eleven genes used to develop the PRS model have been linked to melanoma progression. For example, hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 (HAPLN3) is known for its role in tumor progression and has recently been suggested as a new biomarker for melanoma prognosis and immune status [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 Despite the promising results, our study has some limitations that need to be addressed. Firstly, since our research relied on publicly available databases, it is not yet clear how our findings apply to larger clinical patient samples. This preliminary confirmation of reliability at the clinical level does not fully establish the model’s practical value in clinical settings. Secondly, we did not conduct experimental studies to validate the functions of T and melanoma cell subpopulations and related genes. Specifically, co-staining experiments would be essential to directly demonstrate the coexistence of melanoma and T cell markers within the same cell population. In addition, spatial transcriptomics technologies, such as the 10X Genomics Xenium platform, could further clarify the spatial distribution and co-expression patterns of MITF and immune markers (e.g., CD8A) in melanoma tissues. Due to current technical and resource limitations, we were unable to incorporate such analyses into the present study. Nevertheless, we highlight these approaches as important directions for future work to strengthen and validate our findings. In summary, we identified specific T and melanoma cell subpopulations that influence melanoma prognosis and developed a new PRS model using 11 genes for predicting patient outcomes. These cell subpopulations and related genes offer valuable insights into melanoma prognosis and can aid in clinical decision-making. This study introduces a novel risk model for melanoma prognosis and sheds light on the disease’s heterogeneity and its interaction with the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Conclusions Melanoma, a deadly cancer with a poor prognosis, involves T-cells and melanoma cells in shaping the tumor microenvironment, though their impact on the prognosis remains unclear. Using scRNA-seq and gene expression data from GEO and TCGA databases, this study identified key cell subpopulations associated with patient outcomes. The Prognostic Risk Score (PRS) model, constructed using subtype-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs), achieved the highest predictive accuracy and validated in multiple cohorts. The model was constructed from 11 marker genes linked to melanoma progression. The PRS model stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes ( p Abbreviations CM Cutaneous melanoma DALYs Disability-adjusted life-years DEGs Differentially expressed genes GSVA Gene Set Variation Analysis GEO Gene Expression Omnibus HAPLN3 Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 3 OS Overall survival PRS Prognostic risk score ROPN1 Ropporin-1 SHGs Signature hallmark genes SKCM Skin cutaneous melanoma scRNA-seq Single-cell RNA sequencing TCGA The Cancer Genome Atlas TIME Tumor immune microenvironment TME Tumor microenvironment Publisher’s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
