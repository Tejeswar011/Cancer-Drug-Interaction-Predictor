Introduction Coronary slow flow is characterized as a microvascular disorder consisting of the slow progression of the opaque material administered during coronary angiography to the distal vascular bed without occlusion of the epicardial coronary arteries. This is a significant clinical condition that can cause chest pain at rest or on exercise [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7 8 6 7 Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) was first used in 1980 by Buzby et al. and defined by Onodera et al. [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 11 13 Calculated based on serum albumin and lymphocyte counts, the PNI serves as an immunonutritional marker that reflects the body′s chronic inflammation, immune function, and nutritional status [ 14 CSF is widely believed to be a benign condition; however, recurrent angina pectoris, recurrences, ventricular arrhythmias, hospitalization, and even sudden cardiac death have been reported in this patient group [ 18 18 In this retrospective observational study, we aimed to demonstrate the relationship between PNI, a cost-effective score calculated solely from blood parameters and used as an indicator of malnutrition, a significant health problem, and coronary slow flow. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population A total of 3853 patients who underwent coronary angiography at Erzurum City Hospital, Türkiye, between October 2021 and October 2023 were evaluated. Of these, 2585 were diagnosed with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). Patients with acute coronary syndrome, active infection, known history of chronic inflammatory disease, severe heart valve disease, history of malignancy, history of prosthetic valves, renal and/or liver failure, history of autoimmune disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and missing data in the hospital data system were excluded from the study. Patients were divided into two groups: those with CSF ( n n Figure 1 Our study was approved by the University of Health Sciences Erzurum Faculty of Medicine Scientific Research Ethics Committee (Date: 11 October 2023; Decision number: 2023/06-68). It was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.2. Coronary Angiography Patients in whom coronary angiography was performed using the Judkins technique via radial and femoral interventions according to standard protocols in the catheterization department of our hospital were included in the study. The Siemens (Erlanger, Germany) brand angiography device was used to visualize the coronary arteries. Iohexol (KOPAQ 350 mg/mL) was used as a radiopaque material in the angiographies. All CAG evaluations were performed independently by two experienced invasive cardiologists who were unaware of the patients′ clinical details. The thrombolysis frame count (TFC) method was used for quantitative assessment of coronary blood flow in myocardial infarction as described in the literature. The time it took for the contrast to reach distant points of the coronary artery was defined as the number of frames. The onset is when the contrast travels through the artery and begins to contact both sides. As an endpoint, the distal bifurcation of the most extended branch for the circumflex (CX) is visualized when the contrast agent arrives at the distal branch point called the whale′s tail region for the left anterior descending (LAD) and gives off the first lateral branch of the posterolateral artery for the right coronary artery (RCA). Because the LAD has a prolonged course compared to other arteries, the value was standardized by dividing it by 1.7. The number of frames made by shooting at 12 fps was multiplied by 2.4, a fixed number since former studies shot at 30 fps. When the sum of the three vessels divided by 3, the mean TFC was acquired. The cut off value of TFCs were 36.2 ± 2.6 for the LAD (cTFC 21.1 ± 1.5), 22.2 ± 4.1 for the LCX, and 20.4 ± 3 for the RCA [ 19 20 2.3. Laboratory Analysis Patients with blood parameters recorded in the hospital data system were included in the study. Hemogram values were studied with the Sysmex XN-1000 Clinical System. Biochemical parameters were studied with the BECKMAN COULTER AV 5800 Clinical System. The PNI was calculated with the formula PNI = 10 × serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 × total lymphocyte count (/mm 3 10 2.4. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0 for Windows. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to examine the normal distribution of the data. Continuous variables with normal distribution were shown as mean ± standard deviation, and those without normal distribution were shown as median and interquartile range values. Categorical data were expressed as numbers and percentages. Student-t test or Mann–Whitney U test was used for numerical variables, and chi-square test was used in the analysis of categorical variables. The relationship between two independent numerical variables was evaluated using Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients. Parametric variables belonging to three independent groups were assessed with ANOVA, an appropriate chi-square test was used to evaluate categorical variables, and the results were considered statistically significant when the p 3. Results In this study, 2585 patients who underwent coronary angiography were screened, and CSF was detected in 181 patients. Demographic characteristics of patients with and without CSF are displayed in Table 1 p p p p p p Table 1 Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed between the parameters significantly associated with CSF. In univariate and multivariate regression analyses, age, DM, triglyceride, Hb, and PNI were observed to be statistically significant ( Table 2 Data on patients with the coronary slow flow phenomenon, classified according to PNI values, are shown in Table 3 Table 2 11 p Table 3 No significant statistical difference was observed between the three groups in terms of age and gender ( p p Table 3 ROC Curve analysis was performed to determine the predictive power of PNI, which independently predicts CSF in regression analysis, and the sensitivity and specificity of the cut-off value at this value. In the ROC analysis, the cut-off value for PNI was 39.01, with 76.2% sensitivity and 76.2% specificity (AUC: 0.788; 95% CI: 0.749–0.827) in predicting CSF ( Figure 2 4. Discussion This study examines the correlation between nutritional status and the development of coronary slow flow. Our results showed a relationship between low PNI values and CSF. Opacity of the distal vessels, known as cardiac syndrome Y, occurs when the coronary arteries are normal [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 15 16 17 19 15 16 17 Inflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of atherosclerosis. However, inflammation causes endothelial dysfunction. Plays an important role in the initiation and progression of CSF. CRP and albumin, which are markers of inflammation, are biochemical parameters routinely used in clinical practice. There is a significant relationship between increased CRP and the severity of stable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary artery disease (CAD) [ 29 30 A few studies have examined coronary blood flow in normal coronary arteries without categorizing diabetes separately, and the results of these studies have mainly been conflicting [ 31 32 6 33 34 While there is no definitive treatment protocol for patients with slow coronary flow, acetylsalicylic acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins may be administered to improve endothelial function. The value of conventional antianginal therapies in these patients is limited. Additionally, dipyridamole and calcium channel blockers are accepted agents for the treatment of slow coronary flow [ 35 36 37 A parameter that can evaluate all aspects of nutritional status has yet to be developed. Formulas such as the PNI and nutritional risk index (NRI) have been put forward for this purpose [ 9 11 38 39 CSF should not be considered a benign condition and should be detected immediately, as previous studies have shown that CSF has prognostic significance in the development of major adverse cardiovascular events [ 40 41 Our study has several limitations. First, it is a single-center, retrospective study. Our study included a relatively small number of CSF patient populations and large-scale studies are needed. In the second study, BOS was diagnosed by visual assessment of CAG, which does not provide sufficient information about true coronary blood flow. Coronary endothelial function was not assessed using intravascular ultrasound or combined pressure and flow studies in our study. Furthermore, body mass index data were not available. Data on medical treatment administered to patients after CSF was not available due to the retrospective nature of our study. Further, larger, multicenter prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings. 5. Conclusions This study demonstrated that PNI, an easily measured, accessible, and inexpensive parameter, is associated with CSF and can be used as a predictive parameter for CSF. PNI′s ability to predict CSF, a condition that may predispose to coronary atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome, may be beneficial for early risk stratification, treatment planning, and prognosis. Future prospective studies confirming the relationship between PNI and CSF in different populations may contribute to the pathogenesis and treatment of CSF.
