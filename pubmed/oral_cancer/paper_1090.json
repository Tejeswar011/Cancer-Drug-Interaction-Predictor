The genetic polymorphism with tissue distribution ranging from the brain, limbic system, and adrenal cortex to neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages is evident in MCRs. The mutations in MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, and MC4R genes are associated with risk of melanoma, familial glucocorticoid deficiency, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. Meanwhile, MC1R, MC2R, and MC5R genes are involved in the risk of major depressive disorder. Melanocortin receptors are involved in different inflammatory disorders, i.e., atopic dermatitis, autoimmune uveitis, sarcoidosis, respiratory diseases, multiple sclerosis, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, and reperfusion injury. Several newer therapeutic agents related to MCRs have numerous advantages over the current anti-inflammatory drugs, demonstrating therapeutic relevance. Among them, α-MSH analogs play a role in atopic dermatitis and scleroderma, and MC1R agonist Dersimelagon has shown effectiveness in systemic sclerosis. The FDA has recently approved the repository corticotropin injection (RCI) to treat sarcoidosis. The FDA has also approved various melanocortin agonists, i.e., Bremelanotide, Afamelanotide, and Setmelanotide, for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder, Erythropoietic protoporphyria, and obesity, due to pro-opiomelanocortin and leptin receptor deficiency, respectively. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the function and genetic polymorphism of melanocortin receptors, regulatory pathways involving MCRs, and the existing evidence of the prime effect of MCRs on inflammatory responses via different mechanisms and their potential therapeutic use in inflammatory diseases. melanocortin receptors (MCR) genetic polymorphism inflammatory disorders repository corticotropin injection (RCI) This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The melanocortin system is a complex neuroendocrine and immunomodulatory network composed of multiple agonists, two antagonists, and five G protein-coupled receptors (MCRs). These endogenous agonists consist of α- Melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), β-MSH, γ-MSH, γ3-MSH, diacetyl-α-MSH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), most of which are derived from post-translational processing of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) [ 1 1 2 3 4 3 5 1 6 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 2. Melanocortin System Melanocortin peptides, melanocortin receptors, transmembrane accessory proteins, and melanocortin agonists and antagonists constitute the backbone of one of the most intricate hormonal systems in the human body, the melanocortin system [ 20 21 5 22 23 24 Different peptides are derived from the post-translational processing of pro-opiomelanocortin prohormone by key enzymes [ 24 25 25 Figure 1 26 3 Besides pro-opiomelanocortin derived peptides that act as agonists for melanocortin receptors, there are two known endogenous melanocortin receptor antagonists, i.e., agouti-signaling protein (ASIP) and agouti-related protein (AGRP). Their central role is blocking melanocortin peptides’ biological activity by interfering with their binding to specific receptors. ASIP and AGRP are found in the follicle melanocytes and central nervous system, respectively, and both target α-MSH by exerting their antagonizing effects on MC1R for ASIP and on MC3R and MC4R for AGRP [ 27 28 27 19 28 Table 1 3. Genetic Polymorphisms of Melanocortin Receptors and Their Biological Functions Melanocortin receptors (MCRs) belong to the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family, which plays important roles in diverse physiological processes such as pigmentation, energy regulation, sexual function, and inflammation. Genetic variations in MCR genes can lead to changes in receptor function, which can affect these biological processes. 3.1. MC1R Polymorphism The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene is crucial in determining human pigmentation. Genetic polymorphisms or variations in the MC1R gene can influence receptor function and have significant implications for pigmentation phenotypes and biological responses. 3.1.1. Pigmentation MC1R polymorphisms are well-known for their association with hair, skin, and eye color. Variants in MC1R can lead to a shift in melanin production, altering the balance between eumelanin (dark pigment) and pheomelanin (red/yellow pigment). Red hair color, fair skin, and increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation are common characteristics associated with certain MC1R polymorphisms [ 29 30 3.1.2. UV Radiation Response MC1R plays a crucial role in regulating the response to UV radiation. Activation of MC1R by its ligand α-MSH promotes eumelanin synthesis and protects against UV-induced DNA damage. However, certain MC1R polymorphisms reduce MC1R signaling, leading to decreased eumelanin production and increased susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancer [ 29 31 3.1.3. Inflammation and Immune Modulation MC1R has been implicated in immune modulation and inflammation regulation. Activation of MC1R can influence the production of cytokines and immune mediators, thereby modulating immune responses and inflammation. MC1R polymorphisms have been associated with altered immune response profiles and may contribute to variations in susceptibility to autoimmune diseases and skin disorders [ 29 3.1.4. Risk of Melanoma Certain MC1R polymorphisms are considered as genetic risk factors for melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Variants associated with red hair color and fair skin, such as R151C, R160W, and D294H, have increased susceptibility to melanoma [ 29 32 3.2. MC2R Polymorphism The MC2R gene encodes the ACTH receptor, which is essential for adrenal gland function and cortisol synthesis, a hormone involved in stress response and metabolism. Genetic polymorphisms or variations in the MC2R gene can result in altered receptor function, significantly affecting adrenal function and cortisol synthesis. 3.2.1. Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency (FGD) Mutations in the MC2R gene can cause FGD, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired cortisol synthesis and adrenocortical insufficiency. FGD is typically associated with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in MC2R, leading to dysfunctional MC2R receptors with reduced binding affinity for ACTH [ 33 34 3.2.2. Impaired Cortisol Response MC2R polymorphisms that result in altered receptor function or reduced ACTH binding affinity can impair cortisol response to stress or ACTH stimulation [ 33 3.2.3. Steroidogenesis MC2R is crucial in regulating steroidogenesis, particularly cortisol synthesis in the adrenal cortex. The activation of MC2R by ACTH stimulates various enzymatic reactions that are involved in synthesizing cortisol from cholesterol [ 35 3.3. MC3R Polymorphism The MC3R gene is predominantly present in the hypothalamus and is involved in energy homeostasis, regulation of food intake, and metabolic processes. Genetic polymorphisms or variations in the MC3R gene can influence receptor function and have significant implications for body weight regulation and obesity. 3.3.1. Body Weight Regulation MC3R regulates meal consumption, utilization of energy, and body weight. Activation of MC3R signaling in the hypothalamus leads to reduced meal consumption and increased energy expenditure [ 36 3.3.2. Risk of Obesity Several studies have investigated the association between MC3R genetic polymorphisms and obesity. Certain variants, i.e., V81I and I172V, are related to increased body mass index (BMI) and a higher chance of obesity [ 37 3.3.3. Appetite Control MC3R is involved in the central regulation of appetite and satiety. Genetic variations in MC3R can influence sensitivity to satiety signals and impact the regulation of food intake [ 38 3.4. MC4R Polymorphism The MC4R gene is pivotal in regulating energy homeostasis and appetite. Genetic polymorphisms or variations in the MC4R gene can influence receptor function and have significant implications for body weight regulation, satiety, and the risk of obesity. 3.4.1. Regulation of Appetite MC4R is primarily expressed in regions of the brain, i.e., the hypothalamus, which is associated with regulation of appetite and energy balance. Activation of MC4R signaling promotes satiety and reduces food intake [ 39 3.4.2. Risk of Obesity MC4R mutations and genetic variants have been identified as the most common monogenic causes of severe early-onset obesity. Loss-of-function mutations or variants that impair MC4R signaling can disrupt the normal satiety signaling pathways, leading to hyperphagia and obesity [ 40 41 42 3.4.3. Metabolic Effects MC4R signaling also influences metabolic processes beyond appetite regulation. Activation of MC4R promotes energy expenditure and thermogenesis [ 38 3.5. MC5R Polymorphism MC5R serves multiple vital functions in both central and peripheral tissues. In the brain, MC5R plays a role in stress response, cognitive function, and fetal brain development. In the perifornical lateral hypothalamus, MC5R may control physical activity in lean rats. In peripheral tissues, MC5R involves various processes such as exocrine and endocrine gland secretion, defense behavior, thermoregulation, inflammation, and immune response [ 43 44 MC5R plays a role in sebogenesis by regulating thermal and sebaceous lipid production with water repulsion. It is associated with sebum production and sebocyte differentiation. In mice with MC5R knockout, the production of sebaceous lipids is downregulated [ 44 45 8 MC5R is a modulator of the responses stimulated by glucose in ARPE-19 cells and can modulate the response of retinal pigment epithelium to diabetes in vivo [ 46 The recent literature shows that three genes (MC1R, MC2R, and MC5R) increase the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD), and one gene (MC4R) is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but its association needs to be researched further [ 47 Table 1 4. Intracellular Signaling 4.1. G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) Mediated Signaling Melanocortin mainly acts via melanocortin receptor (MCR) which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs have three subunits, i.e., α, β, and γ. GPCRs are divided into three types based on their alpha subunit, i.e., Gs, Gi, and Gq. All melanocortin receptors are Gs subtype and increase the level of cAMP and act via protein kinase A pathway (PKA) [ 48 4.1.1. Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) α MSH binds to the Gs subtype of GPCR (MC1R receptor) and enhances the level of cAMP, acting via protein kinase A pathway and leading to an increased Ca 2+ 48 49 50 51 3 4.1.2. Melanocortin 2 Receptor (MC2R) ACTH binds to MC2R and is responsible for steroid hormone synthesis from the adrenal gland. The MC2R receptor is exceptional, as it binds to only ACTH, whereas the other MCRs have affinity for both ACTH and MSH. Like the MC1R receptor, when the ligand ACTH binds to the Gs subtype of GPCR (MC2R receptor), increased cAMP and activation of the protein kinase A pathway occur. Similarly, like the MC1R receptor, the binding of ACTH to the MC2R receptor is known to cause p38 pathway activation in human keratinocyte cells [ 3 52 2+ 53 54 55 4.1.3. Melanocortin 3 Receptor (MC3R) MC3R is associated with cell proliferation, regeneration of neuronal cells, and myocardial reperfusion [ 56 2+ 57 4.1.4. Melanocortin 4 Receptor (MC4R) MC4R is related to regulation of meal consumption and appetite, utilization of energy, thermogenesis, and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. MC4R is unique as it attaches to Gs, Gi, and Gq. Like other MCRs, when ligands bind to MC4R, it leads to an increased cAMP level and activation of the protein kinase A pathway, leading to an enhanced level of Ca 2+ 58 2+ 59 60 4.1.5. Melanocortin 5 Receptor (MC5R) MC5R regulates energy metabolism primarily by affecting lipolysis in adipose tissue and re-esterification, fatty acid oxidation, and glucose uptake in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Like other MCRs, it acts via both Gs and Gi. When the ligand α-MSH binds to MC5R, it activates both the Gs-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway and the Gi-MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway. α-MSH-mediated ERK1/2 activation occurs via PI3 [ 61 62 2+ 63 5. G Protein Independent Signaling As a rule, GPCR acts via G protein-coupled pathways. But recent studies show that some GPCRs, i.e., β2 adrenergic receptor and melanocortin receptor, act via G protein-independent pathways, i.e., JAK/STAT, PDZ domain-containing proteins, etc. [ 64 50 65 66 6. β-Arrestin Dependent Signaling β-arrestin is associated with the desensitization and internalization of GPCRs. After the ligand binds to GPCR, phosphorylation via PKA or PKC occurs, followed by binding of β-arrestin and desensitization of the receptor [ 54 62 61 7. The Melanocortin Receptor Activation Effect on Anti-Inflammatory Cells and Responses The melanocortin receptor activation effect on anti-inflammatory cells has been an ongoing study for more than a decade on mice, rats, rabbits, and human organisms. Various studies demonstrated that ACTH acts through the activation of melanocortin receptors found in the brain and peripheral immune cells to decrease inflammation. The receptors also possess a specific function in regulating melanocortin amino acids. A study in vitro of α-MSH was shown to inhibit nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activity [ 3 67 Manna and Aggarwal were the first scientists to discover that MSH activation suppresses TNF-mediated NF-kB in an Electrophoretic Mobility shift assay. MSH activation also represses NF-kB activity mediated via lipopolysaccharides and ceramides in the human epithelium, glioma, lymphoid, and monocyte cells. According to further studies, it was discovered that the α-MSH effect was mediated through the activation of CAMP, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase, suggesting that this is one of the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effect [ 68 69 70 Melanocortin receptors have also been studied in the brain. In a gerbil and rat model, MC4R provided neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia, suggesting a role in the inflammatory cascade [ 71 8 72 MC4R modulation presents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in various neurodegenerative conditions. Melanocortin peptides have demonstrated the ability to protect neurons in both acute and chronic experimental neurodegenerative conditions. This suggests that the modulation of MC4R could potentially protect against neuronal damage in conditions such as ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. Melanocortin activates crucial signaling pathways and thus promotes neurogenesis, which could be beneficial for conditions where neuronal loss is a prominent feature. Experimental models have consistently shown that melanocortin-induced modulation leads to permanent recovery in synapse activity and neurological performance, i.e., learning and memory, sensory-motor orientation, etc. Other than its neuroprotective and neurogenetic action, melanocortin also has a role in counterbalancing systemic responses generated due to brain injury, indicating a broader protective role beyond direct neuronal effects. All these effects are primarily mediated by brain MC4R and the vagus nerve. The observed effects in animal models suggest that MC4R agonists could be valuable as neuroprotective and neurodegenerative agents in various neurodegenerative diseases, addressing a significant unmet medical need, such as in multiple sclerosis (MS). Setmelanotide is one MC4R agonist, and has been found to markedly induce interleukin −6 and −11 production in astrocytes, possibly through enhanced cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. This suggests a potential mechanism for its anti-inflammatory effects [ 7 73 74 73 75 While these findings strongly support a mechanistic role for MC4R in neuroinflammation, it is important to emphasize that the evidence remains preclinical. No Phase II or III clinical trials have yet evaluated MC4R agonists in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, or related conditions. The only MC4R-targeted therapy with regulatory approval to date is setmelanotide, which is indicated for rare monogenic obesity syndromes and not for neurological diseases. Although setmelanotide has been shown to induce IL-6 and IL-11 production in astrocytes in vitro, translating these observations into clinical benefits remains untested [ 7 Therefore, the current body of evidence should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than clinically validated. MC4R agonists represent a promising therapeutic avenue, but their efficacy in neurodegenerative disease remains to be demonstrated through well-designed clinical trials. 8. Association of Melanocortin Receptors in Therapeutic Management of Inflammatory Disorders 8.1. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Cutaneous Disorders Chen et al. assessed the effect of MC1R on inflammation in atopic dermatitis mice models and found that MC1R can reduce inflammation and be targeted as a therapeutic modality in dermatological diseases such as dermatitis [ 76 77 77 77 78 Though the exact mechanism could not be delineated, α-MSH production-related enzymes and receptors could help develop drugs with antipruritic action [ 79 79 8.2. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Cardiovascular Disorders Hart Sailors et al. pointed toward the role of melanocortin receptor genes in atherosclerosis [ 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 8.3. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Ophthalmic Disorders The melanocortin system has a significant role in mediating autoimmune uveitis. Lee et al. showed that subconjunctival injection of ACTH1-17 plasmid increased α-MSH in the aqueous humor of mice and attenuated inflammation [ 87 88 89 90 91 8 92 93 8.4. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Respiratory Disorders Melanocortin receptors can be used as therapeutic targets in various respiratory conditions. Getting et al. observed that wild-type alveolar macrophages are expressed in both MC1R and MC3R and thus noted the potential role of melanocortin receptors in lung inflammation. In addition, they reported that melanocortin peptides could inhibit leucocyte accumulation via various pathways in allergic and non-allergic models of inflammation [ 94 8 95 96 97 98 99 100 8.5. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disorder affecting almost all organs. The FDA has approved only prednisolone and repository corticotropin injection (RCI) for managing sarcoidosis. The rest of the intervention approaches are based on low-quality evidence [ 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 8.6. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Fibrotic and Sclerotic Disorders and Associated Neuroprotection Besides sarcoidosis, various fibrotic and sclerotic conditions have been linked to melanocortin receptor pathways. Melanocortin receptors can have a potential role in the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) [ 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 7 122 8.7. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Gastrointestinal Disorders α-MSH also has a role in inflammatory bowel disease [ 123 124 125 126 127 8.8. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Neurodegenerative Disorders Other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease, are also associated with a defect in the melanocortin system [ 128 129 130 131 132 8.9. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Hepatic Disorders Melanocortin receptors can be explored as a therapeutic target in liver disease, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A study by Itoh et al. reported the development of NASH in melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient mice (MC4R-KO) when kept on a high-fat diet. In addition, MC4R-KO mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma when kept on a high-fat diet for up to one year [ 133 134 135 8.10. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Bone Diseases Most of the subtypes of melanocortin receptors (MC1R–MC4R) are present in bone osteoblast, osteoclast cells, cartilage, and synovium [ 136 137 138 139 140 141 16 142 143 144 145 Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 146 8.11. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Reperfusion Injuries The melanocortin system plays a significant role in reperfusion injuries. Earlier studies have indicated that the melanocortin system mediates anti-inflammatory response via central and peripheral action [ 122 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 8.12. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Insulin Resistance, Obesity, and Diabetes In patients predisposed to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus, a brutal and endless cycle of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes exists. Melanocortin prevents the development of diabetes mellitus by affecting the central and peripheral metabolism and thus decreasing obesity and insulin resistance [ 168 169 170 8.13. Role of Melanocortin Receptors in Pancreatic Diseases Melanocortin receptors, specifically MC4R, play a role in pancreatitis. Wan et al. reported that melanocortin acts via MC3R and melanocortin antagonists diminishes the severity of cerulein-induced pancreatitis in rat models [ 171 172 Figure 2 9. USFDA Approved New Drugs The USFDA has approved several melanocortin agonists or antagonists in the management of different diseases. Table 2 10. Conclusions The melanocortin system is home to a fine balance of agonists, antagonists, and receptors. The complex interactions between agonistic peptides and the G protein-coupled receptors help in bringing about functions ranging from skin pigmentation (MC1R), steroid synthesis (MC2R), and energy balance (MC3R, MC4R) to immunomodulation (MC1R, MC5R). They also participate in both innate and acquired immune pathways. Genetic polymorphism in MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, and MC4R genes is associated with risk of melanoma, familial glucocorticoid deficiency, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. Collaborative involvement of the MC1R, MC2R, and MC5R genes are implicated in the risk of major depressive disorder. The immunomodulatory role of melanocortin and its receptors is well-known, but recently it has emerged as a potential anti-inflammatory agent [ 173 174 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Institutional Review Board Statement Not applicable.
