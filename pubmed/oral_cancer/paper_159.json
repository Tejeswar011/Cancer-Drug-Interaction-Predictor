Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) accounts for 95% of thyroid cancer cases. The primary treatment for intermediate- and high-risk DTC is total thyroidectomy. Postoperatively, serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-Tg antibody (Tg/Ab) levels are monitored to detect residual, recurrent or metastatic disease.

The present study included 3 patients (2 female patients and 1 male patient; median age, 58 years; age range, 45–81 years) with DTC who received 131 ® Table I 131 131 131 Fig. 1 Serum metabolomic analysis Peripheral blood was collected from patients with DTC using serum separation tubes (BD Biosciences) at two time points: Before the administration of 131 18 ™ ® Table SI Table SII Table II Fig. 2 131 https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/metabobank/index-e.html 131 https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/ https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ Cell culture for thyroid cancer cell model The TPC-1 human thyroid papillary carcinoma cell line was obtained from Merck KGaA. The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biowest), 2 mM L-glutamine (MilliporeSigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) for the basic experiment TPC-1 cells were irradiated using an X-ray generator (MBR-1520R-3; Hitachi Power Solutions Co., Ltd.) at 1 Gy/min (150 kVp; 20 mA) with 0.5-mm aluminum and 0.3-mm copper filters. The radiation dose was monitored using a thimble ionization chamber.

The cells were plated at a density of 500–8,000 cells/dish in a 35-mm diameter culture dish, irradiated with 0 to 8 Gy of IR and incubated for 6–9 days in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO 2 21 Cell cycle distribution analysis The cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. The harvested cells were treated with precooled (−20°C) 70% ethanol for 10 min on ice and stored at −20°C until measured. RNase I was added to the sample tube at 37°C for 20 min (5 µg/ml; Merck KGaA) to remove internal RNAs. The cells were then stained with PI (40 µg/ml; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) in the dark at room temperature for 2 min. Cell cycle distribution analysis was performed using Cell Lab Quanta ™ Amino acid uptake assay Amino acid uptake into cells was analyzed using a boronophenylalanine (BPA) uptake assay kit (cat. no. 342-09893; Dojindo Laboratories, Inc.). BPA is an amino acid analog. The cells exposed to IR were plated in a 96-well microplate and incubated for 12 h at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 350 455 ™ ex em CD98 cell surface antigen expression The expression levels of the CD98 cell surface antigen were analyzed using double staining with PI and CD98-FITC.

BCAAs are essential amino acids mostly supplied through the diet and taken up into tumors by the LAT1-CD98hc complex expressed on the cell membrane ( 23 27 46 et al 47 LAT1, LAT2 CD98hc LAT1 LAT2 LAT1 39 40 48 49 in vitro Previous studies have demonstrated that LAT1 48 49 25 34 35 131 48 49 30 25 35 29 Fig. 7 131 131 Fig. 7 The present study has several limitations. First, the number of patients was small (n=3), which inevitably reduced the statistical power of the clinical findings. Nevertheless, in the absence of prior data on fluctuations in serum BCAA levels in Tg/Ab-positive DTC, this work was designed as a proof-of-concept study. The observed clinical trends were supported by mechanistic experiments using the TPC-1 cell line, which reinforced the biological relevance of BCAA metabolism as a potential surrogate marker of the efficacy of radioiodine therapy. Second, dietary intake of BCAAs was not assessed, which could affect the interpretation of serum metabolite levels. Although all patients fasted for ≥6 h before serum sampling to minimize acute postprandial effects, the influence of habitual dietary intake cannot be completely excluded. To address this, standardized dietary questionnaires or controlled dietary interventions should be incorporated in future studies to clarify the extent to which serum BCAA levels reflect tumor-related metabolic changes rather than nutritional variability. Future studies are also needed to determine whether elevated serum BCAA levels following radioiodine therapy reflect direct release from dying tumor cells, systemic metabolic adaptations due to reduced tumor burden or altered transporter activity in surviving cells. Analysis of associations with tumor histopathology, imaging-based assessments of tumor volume and LAT1/CD98hc expression in clinical specimens will be critical to establish mechanistic links. Additionally, prospective cohort studies with larger sample sizes and standardized dietary assessments are warranted to validate BCAAs as a reliable biomarker for therapeutic efficacy in DTC. Despite unchanged mRNA levels of LAT1, LAT2 CD98hc 42 43 42 43 In patients who are Tg/Ab-positive, monitoring of serum Tg levels can be unreliable due to antibody interference ( 6 8 In conclusion, the present findings suggested that an increased extracellular concentration of BCAAs following 131 Supplementary Material Supporting Data Supporting Data Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Mrs. Miyu Miyazaki (Scientific Research Facility Center of Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan) for help with the mass spectrometry, and Mrs. Suzuna Doi (Department of Radiation Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan) for her assistance with fluorescence measurements using a microplate reader.
