Their antimicrobial activities (against M. tuberculosis C. albicans T. mentagrophytes T. rubrum Contribution 2 focuses on the synthesis and spectral characterization of 3,5-bis-aminated pyrazolo[1, 5- a Contribution 3 highlights the synthesis and spectral characterization of new tetracyclic heterosteroidal compounds, namely 14-aza-12-oxasteroids. The reaction pathway involves the Bucherer conversion of 2-naphthols to 2-naphthylamines, their subsequent regioselective C-acetylation (via the Sugasawa reaction), and borohydride reduction of the acetyl groups. Key intermediates of the resulting naphthalene amino-alcohols undergo double dehydration and subsequent double intramolecular cyclization in reaction with oxo-acids to afford the desired 14-aza-12-oxasteroids. The electrochemical synthesis of 2-aminoxazole-based polycyclic compounds is another novel finding presented in the SI. Contribution 4 describes the electrochemical synthesis of N N d Contribution 5 discusses the synthesis and bioactivity of some hybrid indole and 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives linked to a di- or triaryl methane moiety. A direct synthetic protocol was also the most effective, and the isolated hybrid compounds were proven to have significant anticancer activity against the resistant colon adenocarcinoma cell line Colo320 and non-tumor fibroblast cells. This SI has also welcomed theoretical research papers, such as Contribution 6, centered on calculating the premise of the regioselective synthesis of 3-nitro-substituted 2-isoxazolines via a molecular cycloaddition mechanism of the [3 + 2] type, involving nitro-substituted formonitrile N In Contribution 7, the authors report the synthesis and utility of some new 3,7-diheteroaryl-substituted 10-(3-(trimethylammonium)propyl)-10H-phenothiazine derivatives. They and their precursors exhibited reversible redox behavior with tunable potentials and blue to green-blue emissive aptitude. Some of the compounds demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against strains of M. tuberculosis A. baumannii E. coli S. aureus K. pneumoniae The synthesis and bioactivity of some new 6-iodo-substituted carboxy-quinolines is discussed in Contribution 8. The study describes their one-pot, three-component reaction catalyzed by trifluoroacetic acid, which was efficient thanks to cost-effective catalysts, rapid response times, expeditious purification procedures, and high product yields. Their antimicrobial activity against strains of K. pneumonie S. epidermidis C. parapsilosis Contribution 9 concerns the synthesis and spectral characterization of new fused isoxazolidine/isoquinolinone and isoxazole/isoquinolinone hybrids. The reported strategy was facile and efficient, with general applicability, consisting of a three-step reaction sequence: a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, a Schmidt reaction, and an Ullmann-type cyclization. Contribution 10 describes the synthesis and spectral characterization of a new library of C 3 a Finally, the SI also includes two extensive reviews related to the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds and their applications. Contribution 11 presents advances in the synthetic knowledge of various pathways leading to quinoline-4-ones, together with an overview of their structures, evolutionary development, and structure–activity relationships. Contribution 12 offers an interesting perspective with respect to some classes of quinoline derivatives and related structures (including 4-aminoquinolines, quinoline-4-ols, and fused and spiro-quinolines). The selected examples are mostly discussed in terms of 2-azidobenzaldehyde-based [4 + 2] annulations. In addition, evidence supporting the aptitude of 2-azidobenzaldehyde-initiated synthesis for one-pot stepwise synthesis or multicomponent reactions is presented. Some of the synthetic approaches included in this Special Issue provide novel pathways for quinoline synthesis and could also be used to obtain other heterocyclic compounds.
