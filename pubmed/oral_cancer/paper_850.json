They play a key role in protein degradation and signaling, regulating a variety of physiological processes. Dysregulation of their activity is associated with various pathological conditions like cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory or cardiovascular diseases. Protease activity can be controlled by regulating enzyme concentrations, but also by inhibitors, molecules that modulate enzyme function, inspiring the development of small molecule protease inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. Protease inhibitors can be designed from the corresponding substrates by isostere replacement at the scissile bond. This process yields a first-generation of inhibitors that usually exhibit poor drug-like profiles that need subsequently be improved to generate a second-generation, by smoothing their peptide-like features. This process is reviewed in the present report and exemplified in the successful discovery stories of different inhibitors that correspond to four types of proteases, including the angiotensin converting enzyme (metalloprotease); HIV protease (aspartate protease); thrombin (serine protease) and the proteasome (threonine protease). A detailed description of the stories behind their design from their initial discovery to the final product is described in this report. Moreover, despite successful discovery stories, the challenges associated with designing novel protease inhibitors are examined.

Introduction Proteases, also called peptidases or proteinases, are hydrolases endowed to cleave a peptide bond from a peptide substrate. With about 2% of the proteins encoded in the human genome, proteases constitute one of the largest sub-classes of enzymes [ 1 2 3 Substrates bind to the protease binding site—a groove that accommodates the peptide chain—in a way that the hydrolysis of the scissile bond can be accomplished. The binding site can be described as a cavity with several subsites that accommodates a single substrate residue side chain. These subsites are labeled according to their distance to the scissile bond as S 1 n 1 n Figure 1 1 n 1 n 4 Cleavage of the peptide bond takes place through a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl amide, either by an activated alcohol or thiol of a sidechain or directly, by an activated water molecule. The differential mechanism permits to classify proteases into two broad subtypes. In the first subtype, the mechanism proceeds through the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl amide by an activated oxygen of a serine (serine proteases), a threonine (threonine proteases) or the sulfur of a cysteine (cysteine proteases) with the formation of a transient covalent bond between the substrate and the enzyme nucleophile ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Tight regulation of proteases is essential for maintaining cell homeostasis, since imbalances can lead to pathological conditions. Regulation of protease concentrations can be achieved through gene expression or trafficking but also by limiting its maturation, since most proteases are expressed as inactive zymogens or through the inhibition of posttranslational modifications. In addition, pre-existing enzyme activity can be modulated by means of inhibitors [ 5 6 7 8 Despite the demonstrated success, the design of protease inhibitors is not without significant challenges. Successful protease inhibitors are expected to be selective, since non-specific inhibitors can affect off-target enzymes leading to side effects. In addition, a thorough understanding of the target enzyme biology is required to avoid undesirable side effects. Essentially, poor knowledge of the biology together with the design of non-selective inhibitors are the reasons behind the abandon of several discovery programs on matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) inhibitors for cancer treatment in the mid-90s [ 8 The present review examines the process of designing selective protease inhibitors considered within the framework of peptidomimetics derived from their native peptide substrates. As described below, first-generation small molecule inhibitors can be generated by replacement of the scissile peptide bond of a minimal length substrate by diverse isosteres. Then, structure–activity studies are eventually carried out to increase their potency and selectivity. Subsequently, a second generation of inhibitors is normally produced in order to improve their ADME profile by eliminating peptide features they may exhibit. The design process is exemplified herein through the account of the research pathway that culminated in the discovery of different protease inhibitors of diverse targets, including the angiotensin converting enzyme for the treatment of congestive heart failure and high blood pressure; the HIV protease for the treatment of AIDS; thrombin to manage blood clot formation or the proteasome to treat multiple myeloma. 2. Designing Protease Inhibitors Features of a protease active subsite determine the binding residues complementary to the substrate and consequently, determine its specificity. Accordingly, characterization of these subsites is of paramount importance for designing selective inhibitors since they differ even in proteases of the same family [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Aside from the direct procedure of hit identification and growth at the active site of a specific protease [ 16 17 18 19 2+ 1 Figure 3 Figure 3 20 1 145 248 144 21 3. Peptide Bond Isostere Replacement Diverse peptide bond isosteres have been reported in the literature for designing protease inhibitors [ 22 Figure 4 1 23 cis 2 24 25 The substitution of the carbonyl moiety of the scissile peptide bond by an alcohol to mimic the tetrahedral intermediate of the hydrolysis process is a judicious choice for designing transition state analogs. However, reduction of the amide carbonyl to alcohol produces a non-stable hemiaminal derivative that is easily transformed into an imine after a water molecule loss. Instead, a closer stable isostere containing the alcohol function can be made by introducing an extra methylene group between the alcohol moiety and the amide nitrogen to generate hydroxyethylamine ( 3 26 27 28 29 An alternative isostere can be produced by reduction of the peptide bond carbonyl to alcohol with a simultaneous substitution of the amide nitrogen by a methylene to give the hydroxyethylene ( 4 5 30 31 Similarly, interesting isosteres can be constructed by incorporating an alcohol function to β or γ amino acids. Thus, the hydroxymethylcarbonyl isostere ( 6 7 32 33 34 Alternatively, the amide carbonyl can be replaced by a trifluoro moiety, giving rise to the trifluoroethylamine isosteres ( 8 35 Replacement of the peptide bond nitrogen by a carbon produces the ketomethylene isostere ( 9 cis trans 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 The carbon atom of the carbonyl group can be replaced by similar chemical groups using other heteroatoms, like sulfur or phosphorus. Interestingly, these isosteres exhibit a tetrahedral configuration suitable to act as transition state analogs. In the case of sulfur, isosteres like the sulfonamide and sulfonate can be produced. Sulfonamides ( 10 43 44 11 45 12 13 24 14 15 16 17 46 47 Although alkanes can also be considered isosteres of the peptide bond [ 48 18 49 19 20 50 cis trans 21 51 22 52 23 53 4. Protease Inhibitor Design Case Studies In this section, we describe the stories behind the development of potent inhibitors of different types of proteases including a metalloprotease (the angiotensin converting enzyme), an aspartyl protease (the HIV protease), a serine protease (thrombin) and the proteasome, a molecular complex with multiple threonine protease sites. These case studies constitute paradigmatic examples of protease inhibitor discovery, illustrating the use of general strategies on peptidomimetics design to reach small molecule protease inhibitors. 4.1. Angiotensin-1 Converting Enzyme Inhibitors The design of angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is an early example of successful metalloprotease inhibitor design, with the first compounds disclosed at the beginning of the 1970s. It should be stressed that many of the tools available today were not mature enough at that time, so a deep recognition needs to be paid to this pioneering work in drug discovery [ 54 Hypertension is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. It is considered the most common disease affecting the heart and blood vessels, afflicting about a fourth of the adult population throughout the world [ 55 56 Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and the final product of the renin–angiotensin system designed to control water and electrolyte homeostasis, stimulating the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex by increasing sodium reabsorption in kidneys [ 57 58 59 The discovery of the first ACE inhibitors is associated with the characterization of the Brazilian pit viper Bothrops jararaca 60 61 Without any knowledge about the 3D structure of the ACE-teprotide complex, it was imperative to follow an indirect design approach. Accordingly, a necessary first step to acquire an understanding of the features of the ligand–receptor interaction came from structure–activity studies on teprotide analogs. These studies permitted to identify the tripeptide Phe-Ala-Pro as the minimal active C-terminal fragment that was used subsequently as reference model. Moreover, since ACE is a zinc metalloprotease, inspired on the success of the discovery of L-benzylsuccinic acid as a potent inhibitor of carboxypeptidase A [ 19 24 25 62 Figure 5 25 Figure 6 24 25 Figure 6 25 26 Figure 5 62 27 63 28 64 Figure 5 Captopril and its analogs exhibit adverse side effects, such as skin rash and some taste disturbances, putatively caused by the mercapto-containing penicillamine. This prompted to search for novel ACE inhibitors through reversion to use a carboxyl moiety as part of the chelating group ( Figure 7 29 Figure 5 65 30 Figure 5 26 Figure 7 After the success of enalapril, several compounds were subsequently designed. Notably, the substitution of the alanine residue by a lysine produced lisinopril ( 31 Figure 8 66 67 Figure 9 383 387 411 1 357 512 518 1 162 2 457 520 523 527 511 520 Figure 9 Diverse analogs of enalapril were subsequently designed (see Figure 8 2 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 Figure 10 43 68 44 69 Figure 10 The ACE inhibitors commercially available discussed above, are referred in the literature as first-generation ACE inhibitors, since they all were developed prior to the current knowledge on the enzyme. ACE was sequenced at the beginning of the 1990s [ 70 71 67 59 72 73 74 75 4.2. HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an illness caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The virus infects CD4+ lymphocytes and causes their destruction with the subsequent weakening of the immune system. In these conditions, the body becomes progressively susceptible to opportunistic infections. Since the identification of the HIV-1 virus at the beginning of the 1980s as responsible for the infection, the number of people infected with the virus has grown steadily, with a present annual rate of 1.3 million people. In 2024, the WHO estimated about 40.8 million people infected worldwide and 650,000 people accounted died from AIDS-related illnesses [ 76 77 78 The HIV-1 aspartic protease is responsible for processing the viral polypeptide chain necessary for the organization of structural proteins and the release of viral enzymes during infection. Indeed, inhibition of the HIV protease prevents the conversion of the polyprotein genes gag and gag-pol into structural and functional entities, leading to the formation of immature and non-infectious virus particles. The first HIV-1 protease inhibitors were designed by replacement of the substrate scissile bond by peptide bond isosteres. Beginning with the information that the HIV-1 protease cleaves Tyr-Pro/Phe-Pro sequences of the viral polypeptide, diverse peptide analogs containing a reduced amide or the hydroxyethylamine isostere were synthesized and tested. These studies led to the discovery of the first compounds with inhibition constants in the nanomolar range [ 79 80 81 ψ 82 ψ 83 25 3 4 Figure 11 45 46 47 48 49 84 In order to avoid multidrug-resistant strains, a second generation of HIV protease inhibitors was developed using as design strategy favoring ligand–enzyme backbone interactions, considering that these interactions will remain unaffected by mutations. Following this strategy several commercially available protease inhibitors were subsequently disclosed including lopinavir ( 50 46 51 52 49 Figure 12 53 1 1 85 54 86 Figure 13 The crystallographic structure of the latter bound to the HIV protease revealed the 4-hydroxy group forming hydrogen-bonds with the two catalytic Asp 25 25 50 50 50 1 2 2 Figure 14 55 87 88 56 89 Figure 13 The X-ray crystallographic structure of the tipranavir/protease complex reveals that the ligand binds like the previously studied 4-hydroxypyranones [ 90 25 25 50 50 1 2 1 2 Figure 15 This second generation of protease inhibitors corresponds to those compounds most recently approved. They overcome some of the challenges exhibited by first-generation inhibitors including overcoming in part multidrug resistance strains. Atazanavir exhibits good oral bioavailability, permitting one dose per day. However, the long-term use of these compounds is associated with the induction of diverse metabolic syndromes such as dyslipidemia, insulin-resistance, and lipodystrophy/ lipoatrophy, as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [ 91 The search for novel compounds after the approval of darunavir followed two different pathways. One the one hand, the search of new scaffolds embedding less peptide features and, on the other, modifications of existing compounds aimed at diminishing their secondary effects. Cyclic ureas like mozenavir belong to the first category, whereas derivatives of second-generation protease inhibitors with diverse functionalities like TMC-310911 belong to the second [ 92 Cyclic ureas were designed after a key structural feature found in the 4-hydroxypyrones, i.e., the removal of a conserved water molecule mediating contacts between the carbonyl oxygens of the peptide inhibitors and the amide groups of Ile 50 50 25 25 57 Figure 13 1 2 1 2 Figure 16 93 59 58 Figure 13 51 94 95 Darunavir and tipranavir have been used to develop novel inhibitors based on their high drug-resistance profiles. Interestingly, both have ability to inhibit protease dimerization necessary for protease activity. These compounds bind in such a way that the S 1 2 1 2 60 Figure 13 1 96 4.3. Thrombin Inhibitors Blood clotting is one of the multiple interlinked steps of hemostasis, the process responsible to maintain the integrity of the circulatory system by keeping blood in a fluid state under physiologic conditions and arresting bleeding after vascular injury. Thrombin is a serine protease that plays a central role in the blood clotting process [ 97 97 98 A deficient performance of the hemostatic system can be deleterious for a human being. Thrombosis or obstructive clotting is a pathological condition where blood clots are formed abnormally in a blood vessel. This occurs when a clot breaks free and travels around the body to finally obstruct a blood vessel, which unless treated quickly will lead to tissue necrosis in the area past the occlusion. Thrombosis is a common pathology underlying ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and venous thromboembolism being major contributors to the global decease burden [ 99 Due to the central role of thrombin in the coagulation process, it is considered a suitable target for developing therapeutic anticoagulants. The serpin small protein antithrombin is the native direct inhibition of thrombin that blocks its interaction with its substrates. Unfortunately, antithrombin cannot be used therapeutically due to its short half-life, together with the associated risks to properly control its concentration in blood, since there is no antidote to halt its function. Antithrombin acts slowly, but its activity can be significantly enhanced by heparin—a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan—making it a useful modulator of its activity. Moreover, since the action of heparin can be reversed with protamine sulfate, it and its low molecular weight analogs have been the anticoagulant therapy of choice for many years. Despite its benefits, heparin may cause a severe immune reaction known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, leading to clot formation instead of preventing it. The first direct thrombin inhibitor described for therapeutic use was hirudin, a 65-residue protein isolated from the salivary extracts of blood-sucking leeches, devoid of some of the shortcomings of antithrombin. Hirudin is the most potent natural inhibitor of thrombin described to date and works by specifically inhibiting the action of thrombin on fibrinogen. Moreover, hirudin action does not depend on antithrombin and does not trigger immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, making it a remedy to be used when heparin is contraindicated. However, despite its demonstrated performance of heparin as alternative therapy in specific cases, it lacks oral bioavailability and has a small therapeutic window that constitutes a major obstacle for chronic treatment of thromboembolic diseases [ 100 101 The crystallographic structure of thrombin reveals that the enzyme is highly homologous to other serine proteases, with the characteristic catalytic triad constituted by residues Ser 195 57 102 1 2 3 102 103 1 104 Despite bivalirudin and its diverse constructs exhibit short half-life due to the scissile bond after the P 1 105 106 107 108 61 109 Figure 17 Figure 18 1 2 3 The quest for an oral small molecule peptidomimetics of DPhe-Pro-Arg was initiated in diverse laboratories following a medicinal chemistry approach. Thus, taking inspiration from the synthetic trypsin substrate tosylarginine methyl ester (TAME), ( 62 Figure 17 110 63 Figure 17 111 1 3 2 Figure 18 Following a similar designing approach as for argatroban, led to the discovery of the low affinity direct thrombin inhibitor Nα-(2-naphthyl-sulphonyl-glycyl)-DL-p-amidinophenylalanyl-piperidine (NAPAP) ( 64 112 Figure 17 3 2 113 Figure 19 Following a different path, megalatran ( 65 114 115 Finally, the third direct thrombin inhibitor commercially available, dabigatran ( 66 116 117 1 2 3 Figure 19 As can be seen, the development of orally active direct thrombin inhibitors was challenging due to the need to convert water-soluble, poorly absorbable, active site inhibitors into fat-soluble prodrugs that were then transformed back to the active drug after intestinal absorption. 4.4. Proteasome Inhibitors Protein degradation is an essential function carried out by proteases under a strict regulation, since aberrant proteolysis underlies pathological conditions such as inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, cancer or neurodegeneration. The process may take place via two main mechanisms including the ubiquitin–proteasome system and the autophagy–lysosomal pathway [ 2 118 119 120 The proteasome is a multi-subunit enzymatic complex present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells composed of two regulatory units (19s) and a core unit (20s) that embeds several threonine protease active sites [ 121 121 At the time of the discovery of the first proteasome inhibitors in the early 90s, the interest was more surrounding understanding the involvement of the proteasome in different cell functions than their possible use for therapeutic purposes. While several natural compounds—such as the microbial metabolite lactacystin ( 67 122 Figure 20 68 Figure 20 123 Despite the success of the drug, its long-term use can lead to neuropathy of any grade. Moreover, a large number of patients fail to respond to this therapy, and almost all patients relapse from this drug. Mutations and/or over-expression of the protease subunits is a frequent cause of its resistance. Aimed at prolonging the duration of proteasome inhibition, a second-generation inhibitor carfilzomib ( 69 124 Figure 20 Clinical responses to proteasome inhibitor therapy require frequent dosing and prolonged treatment and both, bortezomib and carfilzomib exhibit poor oral bioavailability and need to be administered intravenously. To overcome this drawback, ixazomib was subsequently developed ( 70 Figure 20 125 Bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib are the only proteasome inhibitors presently available in the marked for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Despite a demonstrated effectiveness, their use in the clinic is challenging because they affect normal cells as well, leading to potential side effects such as immunosuppression and peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, cancer cells may develop resistance to proteasome inhibitors through various mechanisms, including mutations in the proteasome or upregulation of alternative protein degradation pathways [ 126 71 127 Figure 20 72 128 Figure 20 73 129 Figure 20 130 5. Discussion and Conclusions Throughout this report, we emphasized the involvement of proteases in diverse physiological processes. On the one hand, protein degradation is key function of proteases, relevant to food digestion and intracellular protein turnover, but proteases act as signaling molecules regulating a variety of physiological processes, through the exercise of their proteolytic activity on diverse substrates. We also highlighted the use of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents, mimicking nature regulatory mechanisms. A simple way to design protease inhibitors is to add a warhead to a substrate to produce an irreversible inhibitor, as in the case of bortezomib [ 123 6 17 131 132 The first case study regards the development of ACE inhibitors. These compounds are available in the market since the early 80s for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. They are also prescribed today for the treatment of diabetes-related conditions, such as diabetic nephropathy, stroke prevention, and proteinuria in chronic kidney disease. After more than 40 years from their commercialization, ACE inhibitors represent the second largest therapeutic class in the antihypertensive market, just behind the calcium channel blockers with a global size market of US$ 7.1 billion in 2024 [ 133 133 The second case study regards the design of HIV protease inhibitors as antivirals [ 134 78 76 76 135 135 The third case study regards thrombin inhibitors. These are drugs used as anticoagulant agents, prescribed to prevent the formation of a blood clot or thrombosis. Venous thromboembolism, the third common cardiovascular disease after acute coronary syndrome and stroke. In addition, thrombosis can be initiated at the sites of an atherosclerotic lesion in arteries leading to acute myocardial infarction and stroke. As explained above, traditional anticoagulants include heparin, low molecular weight heparins and warfarin, covering about 50% of the market. At present, better treatment alternative anticoagulant drugs include direct thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors, factor IX inhibitors, tissue factor inhibitors and novel vitamin K antagonists, being the two first the drugs most widely used of this group [ 136 137 138 138 Finally, the fourth case study concerns proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. This is a class of cytotoxic medications that demonstrate anticancer capability by inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like enzymatic activity of the proteasome, which is involved in cellular breakdown of proteins. The current applications of proteasome inhibitors are in oncology, for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma [ 123 139 139 In addition to the case studies described in the present report, there are many other successful stories of small molecule protease inhibitors design [ 8 140 141 142 143 In summary, we underlined the relevance of developing protease inhibitors as therapeutic drugs, describe their design as an exemplifying model of peptidomimetics, highlighting the use of peptide bond isostere replacement as a thriving methodology to discover novel compounds. We also acknowledged the need of a deeper understanding of the target biology before any attempt to design protease inhibitors, exemplified by the early efforts to design MMPs inhibitors. Finally, we showcased selected examples of successful design through four diverse case studies and showed the relevance of these compounds in the drug market, even years after their commercialization.
