Summary Current obesity classifications may not adequately reflect age- and gender-specific risks in diverse populations. In a prospective cohort study of 166,285 Chinese adults aged ≥40 years without prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer, we evaluate optimal thresholds of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) for predicting incident CVD and all-cause mortality. We observe monotonically increasing dose-response associations of BMI, WC, and WHR with CVD risk but U-shaped relationships with all-cause mortality. The optimal obesity thresholds based on all-cause mortality risk differ by gender, with the lowest mortality risks occurring at BMI 26.3 kg/m 2 2 Graphical abstract Highlights • General and abdominal obesity exhibit monotonic associations with CVD risk • A U-shaped association is observed between adiposity and all-cause mortality • Optimal thresholds for BMI, WC, and WHR are identified in relation to mortality risk • The associations between obesity and health outcomes vary by age and gender Jia et al. examine age- and gender-specific obesity thresholds for cardiovascular disease and mortality risks in 166,285 Chinese adults. They reveal that BMI, WC, and WHR associate monotonically with cardiovascular risk but show U-shaped association with mortality, with higher adiposity appearing protective in older adults, underscoring the need for tailored obesity criteria.

In China, the national prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults, as defined by body mass index (BMI), was estimated at 34.3% and 16.4%, respectively, between 2015 and 2019. By 2030, the proportion of individuals with overweight or obesity is projected to rise to 70.5%. 1 , 2 3 , 4 3 In clinical practice, BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) are commonly used as indicators for assessing general and abdominal obesity 5 6 7 8 , 9 10 , 11 2 2 4 12 13 , 14 2 15 Previous studies using the predefined cutoff points have reported that overweight status did not increase mortality risk and might even be associated with lower mortality. 16 , 17 18 , 19 20 , 21 To bridge existing knowledge gaps, this study utilized 10-year follow-up data from the China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort (4C) study to address two critical objectives: (1) re-examining the optimal thresholds of general and central adiposity for predicting CVD and mortality risk and (2) assessing the gender-specific and age-dependent variations in disease risk across different obesity indices. The findings will provide essential epidemiological evidence to refine obesity classification, inform precision health strategies, and guide future public health interventions and research. Results Participant characteristics The study population consisted of 166,285 participants from the 4C study, with a median follow-up of 10.1 years (interquartile ranges [IQRs]: 9.8–10.3). Of this population, the average age at baseline was 56.46 (standard deviations [SDs] 9.11) years, and 108,469 (65.2%) were women.

To address this gap, we examined the association between per SD increase in obesity indices and the age-dependent risk of CVD and mortality in both men and women ( Figure 3 Table S3 Figure 3 Age-varying association between obesity parameters with CVD and all-cause mortality by gender Solid lines are multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios, with shaded areas showing 95% confidence intervals.

See also Table S3 Sensitivity analyses Excluding deaths that occurred within the first year of follow-up or participants with baseline kidney or respiratory diseases did not alter the U-shaped association between obesity parameters and all-cause mortality. In the overall population, the levels of BMI, WC, and WHR associated with the lowest mortality risk were 25.7–25.8 kg/m 2 Figures S3 Tables S4 S5 Figure S3 Figure S3 Discussion In this nationwide prospective cohort study, we demonstrated that both general and abdominal obesity exhibited a significant positive monotonic association with CVD but a U-shaped association with all-cause mortality. The optimal obesity thresholds based on mortality risk were generally higher in men than in women, with the nadir of mortality risk observed at BMI of 25.4 kg/m 2 2 Previous studies have established a positive monotonic association between general or abdominal obesity and CVD risk. 22 , 23 , 24 10 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 9 , 26 9 , 29 30 The increased risk of all-cause mortality in underweight participants might be explained by the loss of lean mass, which accounts for nearly one-quarter of total weight loss. 31 25 , 32 , 33 34 10 , 35 Current international and Chinese guidelines for defining general or abdominal obesity vary in Chinese population. 4 , 36 , 37 12 , 36 38 , 39 , 40 2 2 38 , 39 2 41 2 39 2 3 5 2 2 , 42 Age has been recognized as a significant effect modifier in the relationship between body weight and disease risk. This study demonstrates that the impact of obesity on diseases risk attenuates with advancing age, consistent with previous epidemiological studies indicating a strong relationship between obesity and CVD 43 , 44 , 45 8 , 17 , 45 46 , 47 48 10 , 49 47 10 50 Gender differences in the association between obesity and mortality/morbidity are well established. This study confirmed significant heterogeneity in the obesity-mortality risk relationship between genders, in line with findings from prior works. 8 , 10 , 27 Figure S1 With the increasing clinical use of weight-loss medications, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists, accurately defining obesity thresholds has become even more critical for ensuring their appropriate and effective use. Current BMI and WC cutoffs may not fully capture the heterogeneity in obesity-related health risks, particularly among different age and gender groups. Our findings suggest that the optimal BMI and WC thresholds for mortality risk in middle-aged and elderly Chinese individuals may differ from existing clinical definitions, raising importance of considering age-specific risk profiles when prescribing and regulating anti-obesity treatments. Incorporating age-specific obesity criteria may help optimize lifestyle interventions, reduce unnecessary medication use, and improve long-term health outcomes. Importantly, given rapidly aging population in China and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, revisiting current adiposity thresholds is not only clinically relevant but also of significant public health importance. More accurate risk stratification could facilitate more efficient allocation of healthcare resources and support evidence-based health policy decisions aimed at improving population health in an aging society. In summary, this large-scale nationwide cohort study, with detailed adiposity measures and long-term follow-up, reveals that general and abdominal obesity are monotonically associated with increased CVD risk but exhibit a U-shaped relationship with all-cause mortality. The BMI and WC thresholds corresponding to the lowest mortality risk in this middle-aged and elderly Chinese population differ from the current clinical definitions of overweight and obesity in China, while the optimal WHR cutoff aligns with WHO guidelines. Moreover, our findings underscore the need for age- and gender-specific adjustments in the clinical practice of weight management, particularly in the elderly, where greater emphasis should be placed on nutritional support and the prevention of underweight to promote healthy aging. Limitations of the study However, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, the study focused on Chinese adults aged 40 and above; the generalizability of the findings to younger populations may be limited. The relatively small number of participants aged ≥80 years may limit the applicability of our results to the oldest-old, who may exhibit different risk profile due to selective survival and distinct physiological characteristics. In particular, our study underscores the possibility that optimal obesity thresholds may vary by age, underscoring the need for age-specific criteria. Nevertheless, given that this age group represents a high-risk period for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, our main findings remain broadly applicable. Second, residual confounding due to unmeasured socioeconomic factors such as income or broader mental health status cannot be entirely excluded. Third, the association between BMI and mortality is partly influenced by lean body mass and fat mass, 25 , 32 Resource availability Lead contact Further information and request for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Weiqing Wang ( wqingw61@shsmu.edu.cn Materials availability This study did not generate new unique reagents.

A total of 193,846 participants aged 40 years or older were enrolled from local resident registration systems of 20 communities from various geographic regions across mainland China. There was no restriction on gender or ethnicity. The selection of communities considered the coverage of different geographic regions with various economic development status, as well as the feasibility of centralized sample collection and successfully achieving long-term follow-up. Thus, 4C study finally included 20 communities from 16 provinces in which investigators were committed to collecting good-quality data over the planned 10-year follow-up period and did not aim for a strict proportionate sampling of the entire nationwide adult population. Based on the national criteria for coordinated regional development according to their socioeconomic development status at the time of recruitment, these 16 provinces were categorized into Eastern (Beijing, Zhejiang, Guangzhou, Fujian, Shanghai, Liaoning, Shandong), Central (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi), and Western regions (Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, Guangxi). 51 51 , 52 For the present analysis, individuals with a history of CVD or cancer at baseline were excluded ( n n Figure S4 The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. All study participants provided written informed consent prior to their participation in the study. Method details Data collection At baseline, trained study personnel administered a structured questionnaire to collect demographic information, lifestyle factors, and medical history. Education was self-reported, and classified into two categories: less than high school (<9 years) and high school or higher (≥9 years). Current alcohol consumption was defined as drinking alcohol once per week during the past six months. Current smoking was defined as smoking daily or almost daily, with at least seven cigarettes/week for at least six months. Moderate and vigorous physical activity was defined as either ≥150 min per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, 75 min/week of vigorous aerobic activity, or an equivalent combination of both. Dietary quality was assessed using a diet score adapted from the American Heart Association, replacing whole grain consumption with bean consumption. 53 , 54 All participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, and plasma glucose was obtained at fasting and two hours post-load. Blood specimens were shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory at the Shanghai Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, which is accredited by the College of American Pathologists. Biochemical tests were performed following validated and standardized protocols. Three blood pressure measurements were obtained from each participant in a seated position using an automated electronic device (OMRON Model HEM-752 FUZZY) after a minimal of 5-min of quiet rest and were averaged for the analysis. Assessment of obesity parameters Anthropometric measurements, including height, bodyweight, WC, and hip circumference were measured by trained technicians at the baseline survey using standardized protocols and calibrated equipment. Height and weight were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively. WC was measured at the midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest; hip circumference was measured at the widest point of the buttocks. Routine quality control procedures were implemented, including periodic equipment calibration and retraining of staff. BMI was calculated as the weight (kg) divided by height squared (m 2 37 2 2 2 2 5 Follow-up and outcomes CVD outcomes and mortality data up to November 30, 2021 were obtained through linkage using the unique identification number of each participant to the local death registries of the National Disease Surveillance Point System, the registries of cardiovascular diseases, and the National Health Insurance System. Disease diagnosis and cause of death were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Incident CVD was defined as the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Two members of the outcome adjudication committee independently reviewed and verified each clinical event and potential causes of death. Any discrepancies were adjudicated through discussion with additional members of the committee. All adjudicators were blinded to study participants’ baseline risk factors. Quantification and statistical analysis Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics of participants were described as means (SDs) or medians (IQRs) for continuous variables and numbers (proportions) for categorical variables. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for CVD and all-cause mortality across predefined clinical categories of BMI, WC, and WHR. Follow-up started on the date of the baseline examination and continued until the first occurrence of CVD diagnosis, death, or the date of last follow-up till November 30, 2021. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, gender, current smoking, current drinking, physical activity, diet, educational attainment, and baseline use of glucose-lowering, lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications. Missing data in the current study were limited, and were therefore ignored. All models were constructed using the available data. The associations between obesity measures and all endpoints were further evaluated on a continuous scale using Cox regression models. Continuous covariates (BMI, WC and WHR) were modeled using restricted cubic splines with three knots at 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles to capture potential nonlinear relationships. The obesity parameter level associated with the lowest outcome risk was identified as the point with the lowest hazard ratio on the spline curve. Gender-specific models were also constructed for each outcome, and potential effect modification by gender was investigated by testing the multiplicative interaction terms. Besides, models allowing for the effects of per SD increment of obesity parameters (3.3 kg/m 2 We did some further sensitivity analyses. To minimize potential reverse causality, we repeated the primary analysis after excluding events occurring within the first-year follow-up. To address the potential confounding effects of other chronic diseases on mortality risk, we conducted the analyses excluding participants with self-reported kidney or respiratory diseases at baseline. To assess the potential confounding effects of socioeconomic status and mental health, we conducted sensitivity analyses further adjusting for baseline occupation and depressive severity, respectively. Additionally, we analyzed associations of BMI, WC, and WHR with cause-specific mortality, including death form CVD, cancer, and other causes. All analyses were performed with R (R version 4.4.1, https://www.r-project.org References 1 Pan X.F. Wang L. Pan A.
