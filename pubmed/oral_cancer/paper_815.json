Introduction Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) is a hematopoietic malignancy that, despite high cure rates with first-line therapies, poses significant treatment challenges in refractory or relapsed cases [ 1 1 2 Sarcina ventriculi 3 Sarcina ventriculi 4 5 Sarcina ventriculi 2. Case Report A 39-year-old male patient with primary refractory classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL), stage IVb, underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and, two years later, received an allogeneic stem cell infusion. His post-transplant course was complicated by chronic kidney disease (CKD), malnutrition, poor oral intake, depression, which was treated with mirtazapine and sertraline, and myopathy that left him nearly bedridden despite physiotherapy. The patient presented to the clinic for routine clinical evaluation post-discharge (discharged 2 days before) and was found to be hypotensive 70/45 mmHg. He was discharged on amlodipine 5 mg bid, carvedilol 12.5 mg bid. Three days later, he presented to the emergency room with generalized fatigue and still had decreased oral intake. On physical examination, he was febrile at 38.5 °C and had tachypnea (respiratory rate 28). Labs showed creatinine 3 mg/dL (was 2 mg/dL on discharge), metabolic acidosis 7.25, and elevated CRP 156 mg/L and procalcitonin 1.68 ng/mL. Thus, he was admitted to the ICU as a case of sepsis and acute, on top of CKD for IV fluids and IV antibiotics. During admission, he developed diarrhea 4–5 times daily and a maculopapular rash on areas such as shoulders, palms, and soles—clinically a picture of gut and skin GVHD. The gastrointestinal team was consulted, and upper and lower endoscopy were performed. Stool analysis was performed and found to be negative for microorganisms. Upper endoscopy revealed normal esophageal mucosa and a stomach displaying diffuse gastropathy, while the duodenum appeared normal. A colonoscopy showed ulcerated colitis and ileitis. Biopsies were taken to evaluate for CMV infection and GVHD. The terminal ileum biopsy mainly revealed granulation tissue with abundant microorganisms arranged in distinctive tetrads, characteristic of Sarcina ventriculi Figure 1 The patient deteriorated with a clinical picture of septic shock, bacteremia, and a chest infection. He failed non-invasive ventilation and was subsequently intubated. He was started on intravenous antibiotics including meropenem, levofloxacin, and vancomycin, as well as foscarnet and micafungin. Additionally, he received albumin, intravenous stress-dose steroids (transitioned from oral), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). The patient developed acute kidney injury on top of CKD. He experienced pancytopenia attributed to disease progression, with hemoglobin 6.6, platelets 15, and WBC 0.4. He received two units of PRBCs, one unit of SDP, with follow-up CBC and transfusion as needed. Furthermore, a PCR test confirmed cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, and a liver biopsy showed hemosiderosis. Supportive treatments included mechanical ventilation, renal support, and transfusions for pancytopenia. Unfortunately, his condition worsened, and he eventually developed asystole and passed away.

Discussion Sarcina ventriculi 6 7 8 7 8 5 7 The research by Tartaglia, Lam-Himlin, DiMiao, AlRasheed, Propst, Fanaroff, and Tolentino focused on the location of Sarcina ventriculi 3 4 5 8 9 10 11 12 S. ventriculi 3 10 13 14 Sarcina species can be easily recognized in histological studies with their unique tetrad packet. However, it is not specific to Ventriculi, as other bacteria have the same shape, such as Sarcina maxima S. ventriculi S. maxima 15 16 4 17 3 7 3 S. maxima S. ventriculi Sarcina ventriculi The gold standard for definitive and precise confirmation of diagnosis involves the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or gene sequencing for the Sarcina 16S ribosomal RNA gene or the pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) gene [ 18 19 20 Chen, Liu, and Fu 2025 [ 21 Sarcina ventriculi Sarcina ventriculi The role of Sarcina ventriculi 21 22 23 Our case represents the first documented instance of presumptive Sarcina ventriculi Pharmacological therapy for S. ventriculi 3 5 3 4.
