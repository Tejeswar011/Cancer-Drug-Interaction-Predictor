These computational models replicate metabolic pathways, providing insights into the metabolism of substances in the human body, while the results of this approach effectively reflect the necessary compounds, reducing the need for direct laboratory work. This review aims to evaluate whether forensic settings and in silico methods present a cost-effective strategy for investigating unknown substances, aiding in toxicological interpretations, and steering laboratory process analyses. Additionally, financial considerations, such as break-even analysis and Bland–Altman plots, were conducted, indicating that forensic labs conducting over 625 analyses each year can achieve cost efficiency by integrating in silico strategies, thus making them a viable alternative to conventional methods in high-throughput settings. Recent studies have emphasized how machine learning enhances predictive accuracy, thereby boosting forensic toxicology’s capacity to effectively evaluate toxicity endpoints. In silico methods are essential for cases involving novel psychoactive substances (NPSs) or unclear toxicological findings. They are also useful as a supporting method in legal contexts, as they uphold expert testimonies and reinforce evidence claims. The future of forensic toxicology is likely to see the increased implementation of AI-powered techniques, streamlining toxicological investigations and enhancing overall accuracy in forensic evaluations. artificial intelligence break-even analysis forensic toxicology in silico forensic toxicology integration This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction In silico toxicological experiments utilize computational models to simulate and predict the toxic effects of chemicals through digital representations of their molecular structures. Methods commonly used in drug discovery and risk assessment include techniques such as Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationships (QSARs) [ 1 The first mention of “in silico toxicology” was in the environmental chemistry and toxicology literature from 2010. Mekenyan’s anthological chapter “In silico toxicology: principles and applications”, in a book edited by Cronin and Madden [ 2 3 4 In forensic toxicology, in silico techniques provide a quick and economical means with which to anticipate the effects of substances related to cases like poisoning and the detection of new psychoactive drug compounds [ 5 6 7 A typical workflow for the use of silico methods in forensic toxicology is shown in Figure 1 8 9 Data curation is followed by typical in silico methods, model selection, and descriptor computation, where properties such as lipophilicity, electronic distribution, and steric factors are calculated. Afterwards, prediction algorithms such as QSAR models are used to predict toxicity endpoints, including acute toxicity, organ toxicity, and carcinogenicity. After completing in silico experiments, expert review and validation of the predictions are crucial to ensure that the computational outputs align with biological plausibility and real-world observations [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Forensic toxicologists can integrate the results of in silico techniques and traditional analytical methods to build a more comprehensive picture of chemical hazards. For instance, when dealing with unknown samples from a postmortem analysis, computational predictions can guide the laboratory’s analytical focus, pointing out which metabolites to trace or which toxicological pathways to scrutinize. In addition to enhancing the interpretation of toxicological profiles, in silico approaches also strengthen evidentiary bases in legal and regulatory contexts [ 20 21 22 As cases of forensic toxicology become increasingly complex, particularly those involving novel substances with limited historical data, the need for predictive, computational approaches has become more critical than ever. While traditional toxicological analyses are reliable, they often demand substantial resources and time to yield conclusive results. On the contrary, in silico methods offer rapid assistance in forensic investigations. This review aims to evaluate whether in silico methods can effectively be incorporated into standard forensic toxicology workflows, ensuring that they are both technically dependable and cost-effective. It involves a systematic literature review, assessment of model performance (Bland–Altman plot, ratios of contribution margins, and break-even analysis), and legal and regulatory acceptance. 2. Systematic Literature Review For this article, a literature search was conducted on two major databases—PubMed and Web of Science—from their inception to 3 June 2025. The search included all records.eligible for the search terms “in silico toxicology” AND “forensic” in any field. The search is outlined in the PRISMA 2020 flow diagram presented in Figure 2 Independent queries in PubMed and Web of Science resulted in 173 records (search was conducted based on the all search fields). Removing 19 duplicates that could have altered the count improved the accuracy of the results (this was based on the author list/title/abstract). The titles and abstracts of each record were screened. Nine records were promptly excluded as they undoubtedly fell under the categories of review or meta-analysis articles. During the screening phase, 13 secondary publications, such as book chapters and position papers, were also excluded. In this phase, an additional 11 papers were excluded due to various methodological flaws (a heavy reliance on in silico predictions without adequate experimental validation, small study sample, etc.). Furthermore, 110 papers were found to be irrelevant or out of the scope of this paper. In summary, after examining the complete texts of 145 records, a thorough analysis (search for original research articles and case reports presenting novel in silico toxicology methods applied to forensic contexts, and employing QSAR, molecular docking, ADMET predictions, machine learning classifiers, or hybrid in silico/in vitro/in vivo workflows) led to the exclusion of additional 20 articles. Ultimately, 11 primary studies were included in the synthesis. The Open Science Framework (OSF) designated 10.17605/OSF.IO/8E2N as the digital object identifier (DOI) for this review protocol. 2.1. Primary Studies This literature review focused on PubMed and Web of Science searches for primary studies related to in silico forensic toxicology. Recent research topics include synthetic opioids (Wohlfarth et al. [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 13 25 29 30 31 32 Multiple studies integrate in silico, in vitro, and in vivo data. For instance, Wohlfarth et al. [ 1 29 31 Many QSAR tools struggle with novel scaffolds and unusual ring conformations (e.g., bicyclic organophosphates), meaning that designer opioids may fall outside of the training sets, thus yielding uncertain predictions. Computational findings must meet stringent validation standards. Without fully peer-reviewed protocols, expert testimonies risk being challenged as “junk science.” In silico methods may miss minor or unexpected metabolites. Overreliance without in vitro confirmation can lead to undetected biomarkers in casework. Table 1 2.2. Trails in Forensic Medicine Operated by In Silico Forensic Toxicology Clinical trials specifically designed to assess medico-legal cases using in silico forensic toxicology are relatively uncommon [ 19 34 11 35 36 In Table 2 With these methods, forensic laboratories can complement conventional techniques, improving the consistency and transparency of toxicological interpretations in medico-legal cases. 2.3. Case Studies Where In Silico Predictions Have Directly Influenced Forensic Conclusions There are a couple of examples where in silico predictions have been applied in forensic contexts, highlighting an apparent case involving genetic analysis in sudden cardiac death (SCD). Recently, Alape-Ariza et al. (2025) presented a study that stands out as a prime example of such an approach [ 40 Worth et al. (2011) [ 41 39 42 43 44 45 Forensic Impact By demonstrating that specific variants were likely pathogenic, Alape-Ariza et al. (2025) [ 40 41 2.4. Case Reports in In Silico Forensic Toxicology Although case reports of in silico forensic toxicology may not be as numerous as conventional forensic case studies, the literature includes examples where computational approaches have played a significant role in case interpretations and risk assessments. Additionally, various open access publications have featured articles that integrate these computational methods with case data. Some articles describe scenarios like drug-facilitated crimes or accidental overdoses where in silico predictions complemented traditional toxicological findings to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the substance’s effects [ 23 46 47 Although conventional case reports often continue to rely on empirical data, the integration and validation of in silico methods are gaining traction, especially when used as a complementary tool [ 48 49 For instance, recent studies have used in silico methods to predict the toxicity profiles of NPSs. One notable example is the assessment of 4-chloromethcathinone (4-CMC), where researchers predicted acute toxicity (LD 50 27 In addition to NPS evaluations, in silico approaches have been utilized in the forensic assessment of opioid analogs [ 7 28 50 51 13 The in silico approach in forensic toxicology is gaining attention due to its cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Traditional toxicology methods often depend on animal testing or laboratory experiments, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and ethically problematic. In contrast, in silico methods utilize computational models and databases to predict toxicological effects, thereby significantly reducing costs and accelerating analysis [ 49 One of the main benefits of in silico toxicology is that it removes the need for animal testing, a concern that is becoming increasingly important due to ethical reasons [ 52 53 54 55 56 2.5. Pricing Pricing for in silico forensic toxicology can vary, and exact costs are not always publicly available for all institutions. The pricing is dependent on the complexity of the analysis, the software used, and the specific toxicological endpoints being evaluated. The cost comparison between traditional and in silico forensic toxicology depends on these same factors. Comparing traditional and in silico forensic toxicology in a university hospital laboratory in the EU, which processes fewer than 400 analyses per year, reveals variation by country, institution, and test complexity. However, some rough estimates outline the main cost drivers as well as a typical forecast. Considerable costs are earmarked for the initial investments of both approaches [ 49 57 58 59 60 Analysis in traditional forensic toxicology requires chemicals, solvents, reagents, and consumables such as vials and filters. These costs can add several dozen euros per test, often adding even more when tests involve complex matrices or lower detection limits. Costs like those are negligible in in silico forensic toxicology. Since the process is computer-based, there is no need for chemical reagents or physical consumables. This absence of recurring material costs can significantly reduce the per-analysis expense. In addition, laboratory staff dedicate a substantial amount of time to the pre-analytical or post-analytical phase of sample handling. They prepare the sample, operate the instrument, and take part in interpreting the data. In facilities with low throughput, analysis costs rise because skilled personnel are needed and heavy workloads can impede achieving economies of scale [ 44 61 To reconcile the total estimated cost per analysis, equipment usage, consumables, and labor must be factored in, meaning the cost of traditional forensic toxicology analysis in a low-to-medium throughput setting in the EU may realistically be a few hundred euros. In the same setting, the cost of each in silico test might be a few dozen euros (approximately ten times less expensive, Figure 3 62 This review considered a hypothetical model of 20 mid-throughput laboratories (each performing fewer than 1000 analyses annually), comparing their annual contribution margins as ratios of in silico to traditional forensic toxicology. The dataset was generated using Copilot, Version 1.0; Microsoft Corporation: Redmond, WA, USA, 2025; Available online: https://copilot.microsoft.com https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365 Supplementary Materials The mean ratio when comparing traditional and in silico forensic toxicology, based on the annual ratios of contribution margins, was 0.996. This suggests that, on average, in silico services generate 99.6% of the revenue margin compared to traditional services across all 20 laboratories. 2.6. Break-Even Analysis The fundamental break-even equation is as follows: p × N = F + v × N p N F v This calculates the number of analyses needed per year to make the in silico forensic toxicology approach profitable. Overall, it is crucial to assess yearly expenses in relation to the revenue generated from each analysis. The total annual cost is T o t a l  C o s t = F + v × N . The total annual revenue is T o t a l  R e v e n u e = p × N . For the project to be profitable (or to, at least, break-even), the total revenue must equal or exceed the total costs. p × N ≥ F + v × N . A total number of analyses can be calculated using the following formula: N = F p − v Assuming the relevant parameters for in silico forensic toxicology and traditional forensic toxicology are given in Table 3 F v p F v p 62 63 64 The in silico approach results in lower fixed costs (for software development, maintenance, and digital infrastructure) compared to physical lab equipment, as well as lower variable costs. This lower cost structure results in a lower break-even point (625 analyses) compared to the traditional method ( Figure 4 2.7. Bland–Altman Plot A Bland–Altman plot was utilized to illustrate the cost comparison between traditional and in silico forensic toxicology, as presented in Figure 5 The mean cost difference, as represented by the central horizontal line, indicates the average difference between the two methods. The closer this value (line) is to zero, the more the methods align in cost. All data points fall between the upper and lower limits, represented by the dashed lines. Any values surpassing these lines indicate significant discrepancies. As there is no identifiable trend in the pattern of the assessed cost differences, which appear to be evenly distributed, these hypothetical cost differences are independent of the average cost, indicating a lack of systematic bias. Additionally, traditional and in silico methods show no comparable costs, as the data points do not cluster around the mean cost differences [ 65 66 3. Future Insights Both approaches complement and demonstrate a growing trend: in silico methods are used to fill the gaps left by traditional techniques. QSAR models for chemical exposures encompass a wide range of features. The rapid turnaround and scalability of these tools can be vital in medico-legal investigations. They facilitate fast and cost-effective toxicological profiling, as well as the prediction of genetic variants. These offer valuable insights in scenarios where conventional forensic medicine methods encounter obstacles [ 67 68 20 69 Genetic use has only been applied as an example; similar computational approaches are increasingly being explored in forensic toxicology, offering the potential to rapidly predict the biological impact of toxins without the need for extensive in vivo or in vitro testing. Since the current strategy involves integrating complementary features, the integration of in silico predictions in forensic investigations represents a broader shift. Specifically, there is a tendency to use computational biology to bridge the gaps left by conventional methodologies [ 70 71 Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and In Silico Forensic Toxicology Recent acquisitions, including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), have profoundly transformed toxicology research [ 72 73 19 74 Forensic toxicology traditionally involves identifying and quantifying toxins in biological specimens. The aim is to establish the cause of death or behavior-related substance use. With the advent of ML and AI, researchers are now able to develop predictive models, such as QSAR models, to forecast the toxicity of chemicals without the need for extensive experimental testing. These in silico techniques can simulate how toxins interact with biological systems, offering insights into pharmacokinetic profiles via physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. It is even possible even to predict adverse outcomes. As noted in recent studies, machine learning is harnessed not only for classifying bioactivity (e.g., toxic vs. non-toxic) but also for exploring dose–response relationships [ 75 76 77 Modern AI methodologies, including deep neural networks, natural language processing, and ensemble learning techniques, excel in handling a wide array of datasets, from high-throughput screening results to intricate omics data [ 33 28 Despite the promising advancements that ML and AI make within forensic toxicology, several challenges still persist. Therefore, it is crucial to validate various models and tailor them to specific forensic data [ 78 79 80 81 The combination of ML and AI extends well beyond forensic applications; for instance, these technologies are crucial in regulatory affairs toxicology [ 63 82 1 83 64 84 There is significantly more to explore, ranging from the development of data generation for rare compounds to emerging interdisciplinary collaborations [ 1 85 86 87 72 88 89 4. Limitations of In Silico Forensic Toxicology Despite their growing importance, in silico methods in forensic toxicology have several critical limitations that must be recognized before their wide acceptance in routine use. To begin with, computational workflows may fail to predict minor or unexpected phase I/II transformation products [ 90 91 QSAR and molecular docking algorithms often struggle when confronted with novel scaffolds or unusual ring conformations—common features of designer drugs and bicyclic organophosphates [ 26 Although in silico platforms eliminate consumable costs, they introduce significant fixed expenses. Licensing fees for specialized software, investment in server hardware, and ongoing model maintenance and retraining can all also be substantial. Moreover, skilled computational toxicologists are essential in managing, interpreting, and updating these complex systems. Economic analyses indicate that at least 625 annual analyses are needed to break-even; laboratories processing fewer than 400 cases per year cannot recover fixed costs, making traditional or immunoassay screening more cost-effective in low-volume settings. Regulatory and legal challenges further constrain the routine use of in silico methods. In most EU jurisdictions, computational results are admissible only as screening tools or supplementary evidence. Full acceptance requires compliance with OECD QSAR validation principles, and the absence of standardized, peer-reviewed protocols renders expert testimony vulnerable to challenges in court [ 19 92 Hybrid workflows—combining in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods—offer the most scientifically robust approach but demand parallel experimental validation. The iterative cycle of predictive modeling, bench testing, and model refinement can erode anticipated time and cost savings, reducing the overall efficiency advantage of purely computational strategies. Finally, restrictions on access to proprietary toxicological databases and the proliferation of “black-box” AI/ML models raise concerns about accountability, reproducibility, and privacy. These factors complicate both regulatory approval and defense of in silico findings under cross-examination. Addressing these limitations through expanded chemical training sets, transparent validation frameworks, and harmonized reporting standards will be essential to advance in silico forensic toxicology toward routine, defensible use [ 93 5. Conclusions This review aims to evaluate whether integrating in silico methods into forensic toxicology workflows provides a cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional analyses. We demonstrated that computational tools—such as QSAR, molecular docking, and ADMET predictions—can rapidly generate toxicity and metabolite profiles, guiding targeted in vitro and in vivo testing and reducing resource expenditure. Break-even analysis revealed that laboratories analyzing at least 625 samples annually can offset the fixed costs of software licenses, hardware, and model maintenance, achieving a per-analysis expense almost one-tenth that of chromatographic methods. In high-throughput settings, in silico approaches excel at triaging NPSs and rare analytes, providing useful results within hours rather than weeks. They enhance legal evidence by contextualizing experimental data and predicting metabolites that might otherwise go undetected. However, full implementation relies on overcoming validation and regulatory barriers; models must satisfy OECD QSAR principles and adhere to standardized, peer-reviewed protocols. This is the major barrier to withstanding legal scrutiny. Overall, the hypothesis of the current paper is supported. When adequately empirically confirmed and used at a sufficient volume, in silico forensic toxicology is not only feasible but also economically valuable. Instead of replacing traditional toxicology methods, it acts as a valuable complement, streamlining workflows, saving resources, and improving the accuracy of medico-legal interpretations.

Figure 3 A chart comparing minimal and maximal prices (in USD) of traditional and in silico forensic toxicology. GC–MS, LC–MS/MS—gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Figure 4 Break-even analysis serves as a strategic tool that identifies the exact point where fixed and variable costs intersect, resulting in profitability. It invites the audience to explore deeper financial insights that foster informed decision-making. The contribution margin, derived by subtracting variable costs from the selling price per unit, reveals how much revenue from each sale is available to cover fixed costs. A larger contribution margin indicates that each unit sold plays a greater role in achieving the break-even point. Once this threshold is achieved, every sale beyond this point adds directly to profit. Figure 5 Bland–Altman plot assessing agreement between Method A and Method B across paired observations. Each data point represents the difference between the two methods plotted against their average value, allowing for the visualization of consistency and systematic bias. The central solid line represents the mean difference, commonly referred to as bias, which signals whether one method tends to yield higher or lower readings than the other. Flanking this, the upper and lower dashed lines demarcate the 95% limits of agreement—calculated as bias ±1.96 times the standard deviation of the differences—encompassing the range within which most discrepancies should fall if the methods are in reasonable concordance. This plot not only reveals the overall alignment between the two techniques but also exposes potential proportional bias if deviations vary across the measurement range. A uniform scatter around the bias line implies good agreement, while a widening spread or a visible slope suggests that error magnitude may change with increasing values—a phenomenon known as heteroscedasticity. Outliers beyond the dashed boundaries may pinpoint problematic measurements or method-specific weaknesses. Together, this visual framework provides an intuitive, data-rich assessment of whether Method A and Method B are interchangeable for analytical or clinical purposes. toxics-13-00790-t001_Table 1 Table 1 PICO table that summarizes the features of the included studies.
