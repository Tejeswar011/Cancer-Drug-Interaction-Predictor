Introduction: GBD and the environment Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, and arterial hypertension, affected over half a billion people worldwide in 2021 and were responsible for 20.5 million deaths—nearly one-third of all global fatalities. 1 Cardiovascular disease (CVD)—the leading cause of death in the EU and globally—affects more than 60 million Europeans, accounts for over 1.7 million deaths annually on the continent, and costs its economy an estimated €282 billion each year. 2 Traditionally, efforts to prevent CVD have focused on well-established clinical and behavioural risk factors, including high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, excess weight, diabetes, tobacco use, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets. While these risk factors remain critically important, growing evidence highlights the substantial contribution of environmental factors to CVD. Air pollution, extremes of heat and cold, noise, and toxic chemicals—especially lead—are increasingly recognized as key environmental contributors. 3 4 5 Figure 1 8 2.5 9 2.5 9 Figure 1 The burden of CVD deaths and key risk factors. ( A B C A 6 B 7 5 In addition, a recent analysis established that 5.545 million [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.305–8.271 million] adults died from CVD in 2019 just due to lead exposure. 10 Importantly, concerning the risk factors for death, ambient air pollution is now ranked number 2 ( Figure 1 6 11 Yet, despite these staggering statistics, pollution reduction has received limited attention in cardiovascular prevention programmes. Most policies continue to focus primarily on individual lifestyle choices, mainly neglecting the broader environmental context. Given the scale of pollution-related CVD deaths, addressing environmental risks must become a central pillar of cardiovascular prevention strategies. Unlike behavioural risk factors, which individuals can modify to some extent, ecological exposures often require systemic, population-wide interventions to be effective. Government policies to reduce pollution, mitigate climate change, and enforce stricter environmental regulations could profoundly benefit public health. Adapting to climate change, improving air quality, and minimising exposure to hazardous chemicals and noise pollution would reduce CVD incidence and yield co-benefits for overall health and well-being. A comprehensive approach integrating environmental risk reduction into traditional prevention strategies is essential for effectively combating CVD in the coming decades. This in-depth expert review will examine the epidemiology and pathophysiology of environmental stressors (although we exclude the impact of environmental health risk factors such as mental stress 12 13 14 2. Air pollution 2.1 Sources in the anthropocene Air pollutants have been recognized since ancient times, but their sources and composition have significantly changed with industrialisation and urbanisation, most markedly in the Anthropocene, the current geologic epoch in which humankind has become the dominant influence on planetary systems. Modern anthropogenic pollutants, many of which are derived from combustion processes, are now a critical public health concern. 15 16 17 18 Urban pollutants consist of gaseous compounds like ozone (O 3 2 2 2.5 19 2.5 20 21 2.5 10 0.1 22 23 While CO is toxic at very high concentrations, such levels are uncommon in ambient air. However, due to its ability to displace oxygen in haemoglobin of blood cells, leading to oxygen deprivation in organs, chronic exposure of lower concentrations has been linked to adverse health effects, including CVD. 24 2 3 25 26 These oxidative pollutants generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), often catalytically, emphasising the need for comprehensive toxicological, modelling, and epidemiological studies. 27–30 3 2 2 31 2 3 2 32 Climate change significantly influences air pollution, as hot weather and intense solar radiation in cloud-free conditions increase the formation of reactive air pollutants. Conversely particularly black carbon, ozone, and methane (CH 4 33–35 36 2.2 Global burden of disease Air pollution poses a significant health risk, contributing to disease and excess deaths on a global scale. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), both gaseous and particulate pollutants are significant factors for respiratory infections, COPD, lung cancer, and cardiovascular conditions such as heart attacks and strokes. 37 Chronic exposure to air pollution is of particular concern due to its link to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are being investigated through epidemiological cohort studies performed in many countries. Health risks have been identified even at PM concentrations well below the annual PM 2.5 10 2.5 2 38 2.5 3 3 Exposure of the global population to PM 2.5 3 39 40 41 9 A recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study identified PM as the leading specific health risk factor, contributing 8% to the total loss of DALYs (the sum of years of life lost and the years lived in disability), followed by high systolic blood pressure, smoking, low birthweight and short gestation, and high fasting plasma glucose. 11 Applying the FUSION risk model and consistent with this assessment, Lelieveld et al 9 2.5 3 Figure 2 Figure 2 Annual all-cause excess deaths attributable to ambient fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 3 A 2.5 B A B 9 A B 3 About 57% of the global disease-specific excess mortality is attributed to CVD, i.e. IHD and strokes. In Central and Western Europe, with a population of about 550 million, the number of annual excess deaths attributed to air pollution is estimated at 423 000 (292 000 to 550 000). 42 9 Figure 2 2.5 3 2.5 3 A recent analysis 43 Globally, the health burden of air pollution surpasses the combined mortality from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, while also resulting in trillions of dollars in annual monetary losses. 44 45 46 47 48 2.3 Epidemiology, air pollution and CVD In 2019, PM was responsible for 26% of age-standardized CVD deaths in the Eastern Mediterranean region, with CAD being the primary contributor. 49 50 Numerous observational studies have consistently linked PM 2.5 51–53 54 3 2.5 3 10 55 56 57 58 59 Beyond CAD, there is growing consensus on the association between PM exposure and stroke.

In a 2022 noise mapping of the European Union, more than 20% of the population was reported to live in areas where transport noise levels exceeded the EU threshold (55 dB Lden noise over a whole day, with a penalty of 5 dB for evening noise and 10 dB for night noise) 115 Figure 3 116 Figure 3 Figure 3 Estimated percentage of residents within larger European cities exposed to road traffic noise of 55 dB or more in 2022. Calculations are performed by all EU member countries as part of the EU Environmental Noise Directive and summarized by the EEA. 115 In 2018, a WHO expert panel conducted a systematic review reporting that road traffic noise is associated with a higher risk of IHD based on high-quality evidence. 116 117 118 In collaboration with Swiss and Spanish researchers, the European Environment Agency (EEA) recently conducted an Umbrella+ review of epidemiological studies on the health effects of environmental noise, with subsequent meta-analyses and evidence evaluation, applying the same criteria as used in the 2018 WHO report. 119 119 The threshold at which transport noise no longer affects cardiovascular health has yet to be determined. Currently, the EU calculates transport noise and health impacts from 55 dB Lden and up, while the WHO 2018 recommended a threshold of 53 dB for road traffic noise and 45 dB for aircraft noise to protect the population. 116 117 118 119 In addition to the established associations between chronic exposure to road traffic noise and CVD described above, recent studies have investigated whether short-term noise can trigger CVD. A study from Switzerland found that nighttime aircraft noise of 40–50 dB and >50 dB within two hours before CVD death was associated with odds ratios of 1.33 (1.05–1.67) and 1.44 (1.03–2.04), respectively. 120 121 Several studies have examined the associations between transport noise and key cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, including metabolic disease and poor mental health. 119 122–124 119 119 123 124 Health effects of transport noise among children and adolescents were evaluated in a recent Umbrella+ review from the EEA. 125 3.1 Translational studies explaining the noise-induced pathophysiology 3.1.1 Translational noise studies in humans Field studies show that nighttime aircraft and railway noise negatively impact vascular function, sleep quality, and stress-related biomarkers in both healthy individuals and those with CVD. 126 127 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 3.1.2 Translational noise studies in animals Animal studies have also reveal that noise exposure triggers vascular dysfunction. Mice exposed to aircraft noise (Leq 72 dB(A)) exhibited increased stress hormones, elevated blood pressure, and ROS generation through NADPH oxidase (NOX-2) activation. 137 137 128 138 139 140 128 137 128 141 142 143 144 Noise activates stress pathways involving the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system, mediated by oxidative stress and NOX-2 activation. 137 145 137 146 147 148 Figure 4 Figure 4 The impact of aircraft noise exposure on cardiovascular health Panel ( A B A 148 B 149 den The findings of some of the preclinical studies in mice have been reproduced in humans. Individuals exposed to high levels of aircraft noise had poorer MI prognosis, with higher inflammatory markers and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. 148 149 Figure 4 Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical activity, intermittent fasting, and pharmacological activation of endothelial AMP-kinase (AMPK) mitigated noise-induced vascular damage in mice. 144 We recently studied the protective effects of cardiovascular drugs against aircraft noise-induced vascular damage using an established mouse model. Mice were exposed to aircraft noise (72 dB(A)) for 4 days while treated with the beta-blocker propranolol or the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine. 150 150 4. Outdoor light pollution Light pollution is a growing environmental concern, affecting approximately 83% of the global population and nearly all individuals in the USA and EU. 151 152 113 153 154 155 156 157 110 158 159 160 −/− 161 162 163 5. Climate change and extreme temperature, desert storms, and wildfires 5.1 Extreme temperatures or non-optimal temperatures High air temperatures pose significant health risks, whether occurring during isolated hot days or prolonged heatwaves. These dangers extend beyond immediate effects like dehydration or heatstroke to exacerbating chronic conditions, including CVD, respiratory illnesses, kidney disorders, and electrolyte imbalances. 164 165–167 168 169 170 171 The 2019 GBD study identified non-optimal temperatures (NOT) (heat or cold) as a significant risk factor for human health, contributing to the loss of 11.7 million DALYs globally. 172 173 Extreme temperatures contribute significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 170 5.1.1 Interaction of heat with air pollution Interactions between rising temperatures and air pollution magnify cardiovascular risk. High temperatures can coincide with stagnant atmospheric conditions, promoting the photochemical formation of air pollutants and preventing their dispersion. Temperature inversions can similarly trap pollutants, leading to episodes of extreme cold and increased air pollution, heightening cardiovascular risk. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that high temperatures and air pollution collectively increase CVD mortality. Research has shown that PM 2.5 181 182 Figure 5 184 2.5 185 10 2.5 3 2 3 2 Figure 5 The impact of extreme heat and air pollution on cardiovascular health. High temperatures cause vasodilation, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, hypercoagulability, and increased cardiac strain, potentially leading to ischaemia or plaque rupture. Air pollution contributes to endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, systemic inflammation, and fibrotic changes, further exacerbating cardiovascular risk. These combined stressors increase the likelihood of CAD, heart failure, stroke, venous thrombosis, and cardiovascular mortality. The interaction between heat and pollution underscores the urgent need for mitigation strategies to protect cardiovascular health in an increasingly warming and polluted environment. Modified from 183 5.2 Desert dust Airborne soil contamination is an often-overlooked health risk. Agricultural activities, unpaved roads, and construction contribute to dust emissions, but the largest source is desert wind erosion, particularly from the ‘dust belt’ spanning North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 3 10 196 5.3 Wildfires Climate change has intensified wildfire frequency and severity.

According to the WHO, 2 million deaths and 53 million DALYs were lost in 2019 due to chemical exposures, a sharp rise from 2016 figures (1.6 million deaths and 45 million DALYs). 213 213 214 215 6.1 Cardiovascular effects of chemical pollutants 6.1.1 Heavy metals Heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury are major risk factors for CVD.

As shown in animal models, MNPs can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, and possibly skin contact. Once in the bloodstream, MNPs may accumulate in cardiovascular tissues, triggering harmful processes such as inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and cell damage. Studies on human ex-vivo samples confirm their presence in arterial plaques, with clinical evidence linking MNPs in carotid plaques to increased risks of MI, stroke, and all-cause mortality. (Taken modified from 285 7. Mitigation measures 7.1 Air pollution Air pollution, predominantly from fossil fuel combustion, is a leading environmental risk factor for CVD, responsible for an estimated 8.3 million premature deaths annually worldwide, according to Lelieveld et al 9 286 To mitigate the cardiovascular burden of air pollution, comprehensive action is needed across both societal and individual levels. At the global scale, transitioning to a 100% renewable energy system—dominated by solar and wind—would lead to an 83–99% reduction in major pollutants (NO x x 2.5 10 287 Adherence to air quality guidelines is central to pollution mitigation. The WHO's 2021 guidelines suggest to limit annual mean PM 2.5 3 2 3 213 In addition to societal reforms, personal-level strategies can offer significant protection, particularly in high-exposure settings. Rajagopalan et al 288 Using high-efficiency particulate air filters indoors, which can reduce indoor PM 2.5 Wearing N95 masks during episodes of high outdoor pollution or while commuting, which would reduce PM exposure. Avoiding or limiting outdoor activity during peak pollution hours, particularly near traffic-heavy areas. Dietary interventions rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids may mitigate pollutant-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Optimising cardiovascular risk management, including tight control of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, to enhance resilience to air pollution's effects. These personal actions, while beneficial, are not substitutes for regulatory or structural mitigation. IT is important to re-emphasize that mitigating the cardiovascular effects of air pollution requires a dual approach: urgent structural reforms to phase out fossil fuels and meet WHO air quality limits, alongside personal strategies to reduce exposure, especially in those who may be particularly vulnerable and/or susceptible. Together, these measures can deliver profound health benefits, save millions of lives, and reduce the global economic burden of pollution, aligning with both public health and climate goals. 7.2 Noise exposure Local authorities can mitigate noise from roads, railways, and aircraft through various strategies (for review see 111 7.3 Heat and wildfires 7.3.1 Mitigating the health risks of extreme heat Public health interventions are essential to reduce heat-related cardiovascular mortality. Cooling strategies, improved air conditioning, and public awareness campaigns should be expanded, such as those of the U.S. CDC's Climate and Health Program. 289 290 291 168 7.3.2 Protecting cardiovascular health from wildfires Mitigation strategies are crucial for reducing wildfire-related cardiovascular risks. Forecasting high-risk events, educating patients, and adjusting medication regimens during smoke episodes can minimize health impacts. 212 292 7.4 Heart-healthy city design Urban areas remain hotspots for environmental stressors, including climate change, air pollution, noise, light pollution, and heat from urban heat islands. 293 293 Compact cities, characterized by high density, shorter travel distances, and diverse land use, are promoted for sustainability and public health benefits. Increased active transportation, such as walking and cycling, reduces CO 2 293 291 293 294 295 Innovative urban planning concepts, including Superblocks, low-traffic neighbourhoods, 15-min cities, and car-free models, aim to reduce car dependency and enhance green infrastructure. These strategies improve air quality, lower noise pollution, mitigate heat island effects, and promote physical activity, benefiting cardiovascular health. 294 296 291 2 297 Long-term urban planning efforts require complementary short-term policies. Measures such as 30 km/h speed limits and ultra-low emission zones significantly improve public health by reducing accidents and air pollution. 298 299 300 2.5 3 301 2.5 212 302 2.5 212 303 304 305 306 Urban heat islands, caused by heat-absorbing surfaces and reduced vegetation, increase cardiovascular-related mortality. 307 291 308 309 Urban food environments influence cardiovascular risk beyond diet quality. Food insecurity, stress from economic hardship, and exposure to air pollution from food transport contribute to health disparities. 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 Thus, heart-healthy urban planning must integrate sustainable mobility, green spaces, energy-efficient systems, and equitable infrastructure. Compact cities, low-traffic neighbourhoods, and car-free models offer promising solutions but require careful implementation to minimize unintended health risks. Policy interventions, including speed limits, emission zones, and urban greenery expansion, can provide immediate health benefits. Addressing climate change, pollution, food security, and waste management is integral to fostering resilient and healthy cities. 8. Calculating cardiovascular risk by using the exposome CVD remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with risk factors traditionally classified into modifiable (e.g. smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) and non-modifiable (e.g. age, sex, genetic predisposition) categories. While these traditional risk factors provide a strong foundation for estimating cardiovascular risk, and their application has saved many millions of lives, they fail to account for the complex interactions between environmental exposures and biological responses over an individual's lifetime. The concept of the exposome, which encompasses the totality of environmental exposures from conception onward, is essential for accurately quantifying cardiovascular risk in a modern and holistic manner ( Figure 9 Figure 9 The exposome encompasses all lifelong environmental exposures, their impact on biochemical pathways, and related health effects. The most significant environmental health risk in the general external environment is chemical pollution, while in the specific external environment, tobacco smoking and unhealthy diets have the greatest impact. Mental health can also be affected by environmental factors like social isolation and work strain, though their contribution to disease burden may be underestimated due to limited exposure–response data. Exposures influence the internal environment, often measured through transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, and metabolome changes. Key biochemical alterations include circadian dysregulation, stress hormone release (cortisol, catecholamines), oxidative stress from mitochondria and immune cells, inflammation, and oxidative tissue damage. Environmental exposures can act synergistically with genetic predisposition or existing CVD, worsening outcomes such as atherosclerosis, vascular stenosis, MI, heart failure, and stroke. Taken modified from 114 8.1 Limitations of traditional cardiovascular risk factors Traditional cardiovascular risk prediction models such as the Framingham Risk Score or SCORE have significantly contributed to CVD prevention. However, these models predominantly focus on lifestyle and genetic predispositions while neglecting environmental factors, which have become increasingly significant contributors to cardiovascular health. The GBD highlights that factors such as air pollution, noise, chemical exposure, and socioeconomic stressors play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CVD, yet they remain under-represented in conventional risk assessment frameworks. 172 317 8.2 The exposome: a comprehensive approach to cardiovascular risk Christopher Wild introduced the exposome concept in 2005. 318 Figure 9 Multi-Exposure Synergy: Traditional models assume isolated risk factors, yet environmental exposures rarely occur in isolation. Urban environments expose individuals to a combination of air pollution, noise, heat, and social stressors, which together exert a cumulative and potentially synergistic impact on cardiovascular health. 319 Biological Pathways and Mechanisms: Exposome research enables the identification of novel biomarkers and molecular pathways linking environmental exposures to CVD. For example, air pollution triggers oxidative stress pathways that accelerate atherosclerosis, while chronic noise exposure disrupts circadian rhythms and elevates stress hormones, contributing to hypertension. 320 Precision Medicine and Public Health Interventions: The exposome allows for personalized risk assessments by integrating genetic susceptibility with real-world exposures. This can guide targeted interventions such as urban planning to reduce pollution, noise regulations, and policies aimed at minimising occupational and socioeconomic stressors. 321 Thus, to achieve a truly precise cardiovascular risk estimation, we must move beyond traditional risk factors and adopt an exposomic approach. Incorporating environmental determinants into cardiovascular risk prediction models will enhance individual risk assessment and inform public health strategies to mitigate the growing burden of CVD in the modern world. 15 9. The detrimental costs of inaction: The economic consequences of failing to address environmental exposures—particularly air pollution and noise—are staggering and extend far beyond healthcare. In the United States alone, calculations show that fossil fuel-related air pollution contributes to at least 107 000 premature deaths annually, incurring health-related costs exceeding $820 billion per year. 322 323 324 325 326 327 2.5 328 329 et al 9 9 In addition, inaction on noise and soil and water pollution impose significant economic burdens through rising rates of CVD and associated healthcare costs. In the United States, the total healthcare costs attributable to man-made pollution—including contaminated air, water, and soil—range between $240 billion and $883 billion annually, with a substantial portion related to cardiovascular outcomes. 322 330 258 10 331 332 When compared to other environmental health threats, transport noise ranks among the top three—just behind air pollution and temperature-related factors. Chronic exposure to noise from transport contributes to 66,000 premature deaths annually in Europe, while also leading to around 50,000 new cardiovascular disease cases and 22,000 cases of type 2 diabetes. 333 10. Gaps in knowledge Despite significant advancements in understanding the impact of environmental risk factors on CVD, substantial gaps remain in mechanistic insights and epidemiological evidence. Addressing these gaps is crucial for developing targeted interventions and public health strategies. The long-term effects of noise pollution are not fully understood, particularly the cumulative effects of lifelong exposure. While acute noise exposure is known to impair vascular function and increase stress hormone levels, the potential for irreversible cardiovascular damage due to chronic exposure remains unclear. Additionally, the interplay between noise and other environmental stressors such as air pollution, artificial light at night, and climate factors is not well studied, limiting our understanding of their combined effects. Individual susceptibility, influenced by genetic predisposition, pre-existing conditions, and socioeconomic factors, also requires further research to identify vulnerable and susceptible populations. The cardiovascular effects of air pollution at low doses remain uncertain. While high levels of PM 2.5 2.5 Climate change and extreme weather events pose additional risks. The physiological mechanisms linking heat waves to cardiovascular mortality are not fully understood, particularly concerning the modulatory effect of medications and hydration status. The cardiovascular effects of desert dust storms and wildfire smoke, which have unique chemical properties, are underexplored, especially in terms of the toxicity of air-assimilated constituents from sources that are anthropogenic in origin. Artificial light at night and circadian disruption have been linked to hypertension and metabolic syndrome, but the biological pathways remain unclear. Research on chemical pollutants, including endocrine disruptors and heavy metals, is limited, particularly regarding chronic exposure at low levels. Urban planning interventions, such as compact cities and green spaces, hold promise but require evaluation for direct cardiovascular benefits. Many mitigation strategies lack long-term assessments. Addressing these knowledge gaps through interdisciplinary research is essential to mitigate the cardiovascular burden of environmental risk factors. Significant uncertainties surround the contribution of manufactured chemicals to CVD incidence and mortality. A major shortcoming that limits the assessment of the disease burden due to manufactured chemicals is that most of the many thousands of manufactured chemicals in commerce have never been tested for toxicity. Without even the most basic information on the potential toxicity of these widely used materials, it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of their harms to health. A fundamental revision of chemical safety legislation to require toxicity testing of all chemicals in commerce will be required to rectify this situation and improve health. It has been proposed that chemicals that result in human exposure should be subjected to the same degree of regulatory scrutiny as pharmaceutical chemicals. 334 Despite growing concern over micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), there is a striking absence of epidemiological evidence linking them to CVD. While preclinical studies show that MNPs can trigger oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction—mechanisms central to CVD—no population-based studies have yet assessed these effects in humans. This lack of data is concerning given the widespread presence of MNPs in air, water, food, and even human blood. The epidemiological silence on MNPs represents a critical knowledge gap and highlights the urgent need for well-designed studies to evaluate their potential role in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 11. Major conclusions and resulting political/societal needs for action This comprehensive review of environmental risk factors underscores the reality that environmental risk factors are major but insufficiently appreciated risk factors for CVD. The findings we present here make it clear that selected environmental exposures need to be added to the list of clinical and behavioural risk factors that physicians routinely consider in evaluating CVD risk in their patients. The evidence underscores the urgent need for targeted public health interventions and policy actions. Individual interventions and behavioural change are not sufficient to address these risks. These factors contribute to a substantial global disease burden, necessitating immediate and coordinated action at a societal level across disciplines and policy sectors. A key conclusion from this review is the necessity of stringent regulatory measures to mitigate exposure to these environmental hazards. Stricter air quality standards should be implemented to limit PM 2.5 Climate change is an escalating public health crisis that exacerbates environmental risks for CVD. Policies to combat climate-related health threats should prioritize urban cooling strategies, such as increasing green spaces, implementing reflective roofing, and strengthening early warning systems for extreme heat events. Wildfire smoke, desert dust storms, and extreme temperature events must be integrated into national health policies with adaptive strategies to protect vulnerable and susceptible populations, including individuals with preexisting CVD. Public health campaigns should increase awareness of the cardiovascular risks of environmental stressors, advocating for lifestyle modifications such as physical activity, improved diet, and stress management to mitigate exposure effects. Additionally, interdisciplinary research should be expanded to close existing knowledge gaps, particularly concerning the long-term impact of combined exposures and individual susceptibility. To reduce the cardiovascular burden of environmental risk factors, governments must adopt proactive and enforceable policies that prioritize public health, environmental sustainability, and equitable access to protective measures. Integrating environmental determinants into CVD prevention strategies is essential to reducing morbidity and mortality on a global scale.
