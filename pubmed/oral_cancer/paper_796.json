Introduction Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in older men, characterized by prostate enlargement and urinary dysfunction. BPH adversely affects quality of life, and its prevalence increases with age, affecting 40–50% of men aged 50–60 years and up to 90% of those aged over 80 years [ 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 Given the limitations of conventional therapies, the development of new therapeutic agents for BPH has gained growing attention [ 9 10 11 Paeonia suffruticosa 12 13 Figure 1 13 14 15 2. Results 2.1. Network Pharmacology Analysis Results 2.1.1. Identification and Network Analysis of Molecular Targets To assess the therapeutic potential of paeonol in the treatment of BPH, we predicted its molecular targets using various online databases. The drug-like properties of paeonol were evaluated using SwissADME ( http://www.swissadme.ch/ Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.1.2. Enrichment Analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathways GO analysis showed relevant pathways such as apoptotic process and inflammatory response, cytosol and cytoplasm, and protein binding ( Figure 3 Figure 3 2.1.3. Analyzing Paeonol’s Interaction with BPH-Related Proteins via Molecular Docking We conducted molecular docking studies using the PyRx software (ver 0.8) to predict the binding affinity of paeonol to several key proteins associated with BPH progression. The docking targets included 5AR2 (−5.9 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 7BW1) and androgen receptor (AR) (−6.7 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 5JJM) regarding dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production; transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) (−6.5 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 3GXL) and fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) (−6.0 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 1FGK), which are related to proliferation; superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (−5.3 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 1OZU), catalase (CAT) (−5.2 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 1F4J), and glutathione reductase (GR) (−6.1 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 1GSN) regarding oxidative stress; Akt1 (−6.0 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 3O96), BCL-2 (−5.3 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 1G5M) and CASP3 (−5.1 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 3DEI) regarding apoptosis; and TNF (−5.3 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 5UUI) and NF-κB (−6.5 kcal/mol, PDB ID: 6POZ), regarding inflammation. The binding energies for all proteins were below −5 kcal/mol, indicating a strong binding affinity between paeonol and these targets. In addition, paeonol established hydrogen bonds with key residues within the binding pockets, such as ASP164/ASN160/ASN193 in 5AR2 and GLU681/ARG752/LYS808 in AR, as well as GLN398/ASN385 in CAT, GLU562/TYR563 in FGF-1, and PHE353/TRP178/CYS184 in NF-κB. These interactions suggest that paeonol may exert stabilizing effects through both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts with critical residues of BPH-related targets. The detailed docking results are shown in Table 1 Figure 4 2.2. In Vivo Experiment 2.2.1. Effects of Paeonol on Body Weight and Prostate in BPH This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 30-day treatment regimen in testosterone-induced BPH rat model with oral administration of paeonol. At the end of the study, prostate weight, and relative prostate weight were significantly higher in the BPH group than in the normal control (NC) group. Treatment with paeonol significantly reduced both prostate weight and its relative weight ratio ( Figure 5 Figure 5 2.2.2. Effects of Paeonol on Prostate Tissue Morphology Prostate tissue histomorphology was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In the NC group, the acinar glands retained a round shape with normal cylindrical epithelial cells, and no proliferation or fibrosis of the connective tissue was observed. By contrast, the BPH group exhibited significant glandular proliferation, with acinar epithelial cells assuming oval or linear shapes and irregular distribution with several folds. The connective tissues exhibited severe cellular proliferation and fibrosis. In paeonol-treated groups, the acinar glands appeared more rounded with less atrophy than in the BPH group. The acinar epithelial cells maintained a cuboidal shape with more regular distribution, and the connective tissue showed milder proliferation and reduced fibrosis ( Figure 6 2.2.3. Effects of Paeonol on Serum Testosterone Levels To investigate the hormonal effects of paeonol on BPH treatment, serum testosterone levels were analyzed. The BPH group showed a significant increase compared to the NC group, whereas paeonol treatment significantly reduced serum testosterone levels ( Figure 7 2.2.4. Effects of Paeonol on Gene Expression in the Prostate Tissue Gene expression levels of 5AR1, 5AR2, AR, TGF-β1, FGF-1, SOD1, GR, Akt1, BCL-2, CASP3, TNF, and NF-κB in the BPH group were significantly upregulated compared to the NC group, while CAT, CASP3, and TNF levels remained insignificant between groups ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 2.2.5. Effects of Paeonol on Kidney and Liver Functions Renal and hepatic functions were assessed by measuring the serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Creatinine levels significantly decreased in the BPH group compared to those in the NC group, although all values remained within the normal range. All serum markers showed no significant difference in the experimental groups ( Figure 9 3. Discussion BPH, which is characterized by an overgrowth of prostatic stromal and epithelial cells, is a nonmalignant condition caused by an imbalance between cell apoptosis and proliferation [ 16 4 7 16 5 17 18 8 13 14 15 While multiple factors are involved in BPH progression, controlling DHT production is considered the most crucial factor [ 7 16 19 BPH is described as a disruption of prostatic homeostasis between cell proliferation and apoptosis [ 16 20 21 22 18 23 Reduced apoptosis is another crucial element in BPH progression, as an imbalance between the growth and apoptosis of epithelial and stromal prostate cells leads to BPH [ 24 25 Activation of Akt triggers many downstream pathways that enhance AR transcriptional activity, thereby accelerating BPH progression [ 26 27 26 15 28 Inflammation is involved in the development of BPH, with BPH nodules largely comprising inflammatory cells [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 13 As BPH is prevalent along with age, the production of free radicals, which trigger hyperplastic transformation in the prostate through oxidative stress, is also one of the factors leading to BPH progression [ 35 36 5 37 38 39 40 Our study has some limitations. First, while DHT suppression is strongly suggested from the downregulated expression of 5AR2 and AR, direct quantification of DHT was not performed in the present study. Future studies of paeonol on its effects in prostate DHT levels are warranted for validation. Additionally, while our study elucidated many molecular mechanisms beneath improvements in BPH, future confirmation at protein levels would enhance comprehensive validation of the elaborated pathways. Lastly, although treatment periods of natural products in clinical studies of human BPH treatment typically range from 12 weeks to 96 weeks [ 10 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of paeonol on BPH using network pharmacology in conjunction with a testosterone-induced BPH rat model. As demonstrated in our study, certain in silico results differ from in vivo findings, underscoring the need for real-world validation. Nevertheless, network pharmacology provided valuable insights by enabling identification of potential therapeutic targets based on existing databases. Specifically, in silico analysis suggested involvement of PI3K-Akt and NF-κB pathways, and top 10 hub genes also included Akt and NF-κB. Consistent with these predictions, paeonol effectively inhibited mRNA expression of these genes in prostate tissue. Such modulations may lead to suppression of downstream proliferation and AR activation, thus ameliorating BPH progression as shown in the in vivo study. In the subsequent in vivo study, paeonol significantly reduced prostate volume and weight, which is noteworthy, as prostate volume is a strong predictor of BPH progression [ 7 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Network Pharmacology Analysis 4.1.1. Identification of Paeonol and BPH-Associated Targets The SMILES structure of paeonol (CC(=O)C1=C(C=C(C=C1)OC)O) was obtained from PubChem along with its two- and three-dimensional structures. To identify the potential targets of paeonol, various databases were used, including the Sea search server ( https://sea.bkslab.org/ https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ https://tcmspw.com/tcmsp.php http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/ http://www.swissadme.ch/ For the identification of BPH-associated genes, Genecards ( https://www.genecards.org/ 4.1.2. Intersection Analysis of Paeonol and BPH Targets To identify common targets between paeonol and BPH, VENNY 2.1.0 ( https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html 4.1.3. PPI Network Visualization We constructed a PPI network to display the shared targets of paeonol and BPH using the STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org/ 4.1.4. Enrichment Analysis GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the DAVID database ( https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov/ p 4.1.5. Molecular Docking Analysis The docking targets were selected based on both network pharmacology predictions and their established roles in BPH pathophysiology. 5AR2 and AR were included due to their central involvement in dihydrotestosterone synthesis and androgen signaling. TGF-β1 and FGF-1 were chosen as representative growth factors implicated in stromal proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition, and epithelial hyperplasia. GR was included as a key antioxidant enzyme regulating redox balance, given the contribution of oxidative stress to BPH. In addition, Akt1 and NF-κB were selected as central signaling nodes mediating proliferation and inflammation, consistent with hub gene and pathway enrichment results. Collectively, these targets were prioritized as they reflect the multifactorial mechanisms underlying BPH progression. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the binding affinity between paeonol and its targets, 5AR (PDB ID: 7BW1), AR (PDB ID: 5JJM), TGF-β1 (PDB ID: 3GXL), FGF-1 (PDB ID: 1FGK), GR (PDB ID: 1GSN), CAT (PDB ID: 1F4J), SOD1 (PDB ID: 1OZU), Akt1 (PDB ID: 3O96), BCL-2 (PDB ID: 1G5M), CASP3 (PDB ID: 3DEI), TNF (PDB ID: 5UUI), and NF-κB (PDB ID: 6POZ). The three-dimensional structures of these proteins were retrieved from the PDB database ( https://www.rcsb.org/ 4.2. In Vivo Study 4.2.1. Paeonol Preparation Method Paeonol (CAS RN: 552-41-0) was obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan. The purity of paeonol exceeded 98%. 4.2.2. Animal Study Male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 200–220 g were obtained from Orientbio Inc. (Seoul, Republic of Korea) and housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle with 40–70% humidity. They had unrestricted access to standard laboratory chow and water. Following a one-week adaptation period, the rats were randomly divided into five distinct groups (n = 5 in each group). In the NC group, rats underwent a sham operation without castration, received subcutaneous corn oil, and were orally administered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (5 mL/kg) daily. Except for the NC group, all rats were castrated and allowed to recover for one day before BPH induction. To induce BPH, castrated rats were subcutaneously injected with TP at a dose of 20 mg/kg in corn oil (Wako Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 days following castration. After castration, the rats were allocated into four groups and orally administered either PBS at 5 mL/kg (BPH group), finasteride (Merck and Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA) at 1 mg/kg (Fin group), or paeonol at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg (Pae100 and Pae200 groups, respectively) over a 30-day period. 4.2.3. Body Weight and Prostate Measurement Body weight was measured weekly throughout the experimental period. After 30 days, the rats were sacrificed, and their prostates were carefully excised, cleaned, and weighed. Prostate volume was calculated using the formula: prostate volume (cm 3 2 4.2.4. Histological Examination Using H&E Staining The prostate tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. The samples were dehydrated using a graded ethanol series (70%, 80%, 95%, and 100%) and embedded in paraffin to create tissue blocks. Sections of 4 μm thickness were cut from each block using a microtome and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. For staining, the slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated using a descending ethanol gradient (100%, 95%, 80%, and 70%), followed by distilled water. The tissue sections were stained with H&E. Digital images were captured using an optical microscope equipped with a high-resolution camera and further analyzed on a computer. 4.2.5. Serum Testosterone Analysis Blood samples were collected, coagulated at ambient temperature, and centrifuged at 3000× g 4.2.6. Gene Expression Analysis of Prostate Tissues qRT-PCR analysis was used to evaluate the expression of multiple target genes in prostate cells. Total RNA was extracted from prostate tissues, and 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in a reaction mixture containing PCR buffer, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dNTPs, 20 U RNasin, and 2.5 μM Oligo(dT) primers. The reaction was obtained at 42 °C for 50 min, followed by 70 °C for 15 min. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as an internal control. Expression levels were quantified as fold changes by converting the threshold cycle data for each gene to relative quantification values against EF-1α, utilizing the SDS software 2.4. The specific primer sequences used for qRT-PCR analysis were as follows: 5AR1 (5′-GAGATATTCAGCTGAGACCC-3′ and 5′-TTAGTATGTGGGCAGCTTGG-3′); 5AR2 (5′-ATTTGTGTGGCAGAGAGAGG-3′ and 5′-TTGATTGACTGCCTGGATGGC-3′); AR (5′-TCCTGGCAGTCTTCAAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGAAGAGCACTGCTCTCAGG-3′); TGF-β1 (5′-AGCAACAATTCCTGGCGATAG-3′ and 5′-GTTGTTGCGGTCAATAGGTGA-3′); FGF-1 (5′-ATGGCTGCTGGAGAAGGATA-3′ and 5′-TGGAAGTGTTGAAGGGGAGA-3′); SOD1 (5′-GGTGGTGGCCAAAGGATGAAG-3′ and 5′-CAGGTCTCCAACATGCCTCTCT-3′); CAT (5′-AGGTCAGGAGAAACGGGAG-3′ and 5′-TCTCCAGACCTGCGAAAGC-3′); GR (5′-TGACCGAGTTTGGGATGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCACGTTGTTCTCCTCCTTG-3′); AKT1 (5′-TGAAGGAGGGAGTGTGTGGA-3′ and 5′-GGAGAGGAGGAGGAAGGTGT-3′); BCL-2 (5′-GGTGAACTGGGGGAGGATTG-3′ and 5′-TCACTTGTGGCCCAGATAGG-3′); CASP3 (5′-TGCAGGAGCTGTTTCAGAG-3′ and 5′-GTGAGGAACTGAAAGGAAAG-3′); TNF-α (5′-AGCCGATGGGTTGTACCTTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTAGGAGACGGCGATGA-3′); NF-κB (5′-CTGGTGCCTGTTGTGTGAA-3′ and 5′-TGGCTGTGGGGTAGGAGGTA-3′); GAPDH (5′-TGCCAAGGCTGTGGGCAAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′). 4.2.7. Liver and Kidney Function Assessment Biochemical markers, including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were measured to assess liver and kidney functions. 4.2.8. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (version 5.0). Differences between groups were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Data are presented as means ± standard errors of the mean, and a two-tailed p p p p 5. Conclusions This study investigated the multifaceted effects of paeonol on BPH, including its regulation of DHT production, growth factors, apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Following the identification of potential therapeutic targets with network pharmacology, validation was performed using a BPH-induced rat model. Mechanisms involved in DHT regulation through inhibition of 5AR2 and AR, and suppression of proliferation Via downregulation of TGF-β1 and FGF-1 were highlighted. Additionally, paeonol’s effects on regulating apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress through the suppression of AKT1, NF-κB, and GR were also elucidated. These mechanistic pathways contributed to remarkable reduction in the prostate volume and histological improvement in the paeonol-treated BPH rat model. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential use of paeonol for BPH treatment. Future investigations on upstream regulatory pathways, and validation at protein levels are warranted for future research.
