Introduction Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), known as a critical endocrine disruptor, was linked to potential intergenerational effect in population studies. Yet, the toxic metabolic mechanisms remain unclear, particularly at relatively low PFOS concentration. Methods This study investigated the metabolic impacts of early-life (pregnancy and lactation) PFOS exposure on adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) offspring rats using an integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics approach. Metabolic phenotypes, including glucose tolerance, lipids, and metabolic biomarkers were measured. Results Early-life exposure to 0.03 mg/kg PFOS was found to be associated with elevated fasting and 15-minute blood glucose, serum insulin, and adiponectin levels and a decrease of leptin level in dose of 0.3 mg/kg was observed. Differentially expressed genes induced by PFOS exposure were enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling, parathyroid hormone synthesis, secretion and action, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, insulin signaling, retinol metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, glucagon signaling, type II diabetes, and PPAR signaling. Differentially expressed metabolites were linked to citric acid cycle, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Coenrichment analysis revealed feature changes in several pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and primary bile acid synthesis (0.03 mg/kg), and retinol metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, DGlutamine and D-Glutamine biosynthesis, and fatty acid elongation (0.3 mg/kg). Conclusion Early-life exposure to PFOS might lead to metabolic perturbations in adult offspring, which might be triggered by changes in pathways, i.g. glycerophospholipid metabolism, retinol metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and fatty acid elongation. Further validation of these pathways is required. perfluorooctane sulfonate glucose homeostasis early-life exposure multi-omics intergenerational impact The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

These effects are not limited to hypoplasia, low immunity, growth retardation, and neurobehavioral developmental disorders during the perinatal and childhood stages. Instead, they may extend into adulthood and increase the susceptibility to metabolic disease i.g. obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease ( 1 3 Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), as persistent chemicals, are renowned for their unique surfactant qualities, which have led to their widespread utilization in various daily-life products such as non-stick pans, fire extinguishers, and carpets ( 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 13 14 Studies in rodent animals revealed that exposure to PFOS at a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg·bd could result in a notable and statistically significant elevation of metabolic indicators, such as levels of insulin, leptin, the area-under-curve (AUC) value at 10 weeks after weaning, glucose (increased but not significant), and decreased adiponectin level in adult offspring rats ( 15 16 16 17 18 19 20 21 Fortunately, the emergence of multi-omics technologies, including transcriptomics and metabolomics, has revolutionized the field of toxicology. These advanced approaches offer high throughput and sensitivity, enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple targets and identification of low-abundance gene expressions and metabolites. While numerous studies have applied metabolomics in toxicological research, the novelty of our work lies in the integrated application of both transcriptomics and metabolomics to comprehensively and systematically characterize the molecular perturbations induced by PFOS exposure. By combining these two powerful approaches, our study provides deeper insights into the coordinated changes at both the gene and metabolite levels, allowing for more precise identification of disrupted biological pathways and critical molecular targets that may underlie PFOS toxicity. This study endeavored to: 1) comprehensively assess the intergenerational glucolipid changes of PFOS exposure in adult offspring, and 2) unravel the possible mechanisms through the utilization of multi-omics technique. 2 Methods 2.1 Animal treatment The PFOS Potassium Salt, with a purity of 98% and CAS number 2795-39-3, was procured from Toronto Research Chemicals. 3% starch gel was prepared to dissolve PFOS and administered once daily via oral gavage throughout gestation and lactation. The selection of oral gavage doses of FPOS at 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg body weight was derived from the human tolerable daily intake (TDI): 150 ng/kg body weight and the reference dose (RfD): 20 ng/kg·d launched by the European Food Safety Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States, respectively. To consider variations between humans and mice, a correction factor of 10× for inter-individual differences and an interspecies correction factor (toxicodynamics: 3 and toxicokinetics: 81) were applied ( 22 23 24 Female and male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged 9-11 weeks were procured from Hunan Silaike Jingda (China). Following a one-week acclimatization period, SD rats were permitted to mate overnight (female: male, 2:1). The verification of pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of a vaginal plug. Subsequently, Random assignment placed pregnant rats into three treatment groups, each consisting of 7-8 rats. From gestational day 1 (GD1) until the time of sacrifice, they were administered the assigned treatment orally. Pregnant maternal rats were accommodated in a controlled environment with specific pathogen-free conditions, ensuring a temperature between 21-25°C, humidity levels maintained at 40-60%, and a 12-hour light-dark photoperiod. Body weight and diet consumption of maternal rats were diligently documented daily. The postpartum rats were euthanized at postnatal day 35 (PND 35) after they finished lactation (PND 21), and measurements of litter weight, number of fetuses, and stillbirths were recorded both at birth and 3 days post-birth. Weaned offspring rats from all dams of maternal rats were pooled and 10 of each treated group were randomly selected in a 1:1 ratio of females to males (5 females and 5 males) to constitute the F1 generation. After weaning at three weeks of age, the pups were housed individually. Offspring rats per group were fed without any treatment and body weight and dietary consumption every week were recorded until sacrificed in the 12 th 2.2 Assessment of metabolic phenotypes 2.2.1 Oral glucose tolerance test and lipid profile For the OGTT, 12-week-old offspring rats were subjected to an overnight fast (12 hours) ( 25 Serum from fasting aortic blood samples was obtained and subsequently analyzed by an automated biochemical analyzer (XL-600, ERBA, Germany) to quantify the lipid profile, including total triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). 2.2.2 Adipokine measurement In this study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to assess the serum expression levels of metabolic molecules including adiponectin (CATALOG# 80570), lepti n(CATALOG# 90040), and insulin (CATALOG#H203-1-1). Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was derived. 2.3 Transcriptomic sequencing From each group, four liver samples (male: female= 2:2) were randomly chosen for transcriptomic sequencing. Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity and purity were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Only samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 7.0, OD260/280 between 1.8–2.2, and total RNA >1 µg were included for library preparation. Subsequently, mRNA was isolated and utilized to construct cDNA libraries following the standardized Illumina protocol. Basically, mRNA was enriched using oligo(dT) magnetic beads, fragmented, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. After end-repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification, the libraries were quantified by Qubit and validated by Bioanalyzer. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq™ platform, generating ~20–50 million paired-end reads per sample that underwent subsequent processing to acquire clean reads. Raw reads were quality filtered using fastp, removing adapter contamination, low-quality reads (Phred score < 20), and reads with >10% unknown bases (N). Clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using HISAT2. Mapping rates ≥90% were expected. Samples with unusually low mapping rate, high duplication rate, or low total reads (<20 million) were flagged and reviewed. These reads were then aligned to the reference genome sequence. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering were used to detect outlier samples. Outliers due to technical artifacts (e.g., low RNA quality, batch failure) were excluded before downstream analyses. DESeq and q-values (adjusted p-values by Benjamini and Hochberg method) were utilized to determine the variations in gene expression. Genes with a q-value of less than 0.05 were recognized as showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and the Gene Ontology (GO) database were employed for gene annotation, biological interpretation, and clustering analysis. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm the differentially expressed target genes identified from RNA sequencing. Eight differentially expressed genes and one housekeeping gene were selected. The gene-specific primers were listed in  Supplementary Table S1 24 2.4 Metabolomic profiling Eight offspring liver samples (male: female= 4:4) in each treated group were chosen randomly and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was applied for non-targeted metabolomic analysis, details were reported ( 24 2.5 Statistical analysis Differential gene expressions were analyzed using DESeq. PCA was employed to investigate metabolite variability. Furthermore, Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) was utilized to identify differential metabolites by filtering out orthogonal variables unrelated to categorical variables, thus obtaining robust information on group differences. Differential metabolites were confirmed based on the p Body weight, organ/body weight ratio, blood glucose levels, lipid levels, and metabolic factors were described as mean ± standard error (SE). Group comparisons were conducted using one-way ANOVA analysis or nonparametric tests where appropriate. LSD test or Dunnett’s T3 test was applied in terms of the homogeneity of variance among different groups. Given that the ratio of male: female rats among each treated group was same and no sex difference was observed, thus no further stratified analysis by offspring gender was conducted. 2.6 Multi-omics integration To benefit a comprehensive interpretation of the biological relationships between DEGs and differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) in the offspring liver, we performed simultaneous mapping to the KEGG pathway. This integrative analysis aimed to elucidate the potential perturbed biological pathways induced by early-life PFOS exposure. Further, the metabolic pathway analysis for the candidate genes and metabolites was conducted by online tool MetaboAnalyst 5.0. All data analyses were conducted using R 3.4.1 and SPSS 22.0. A significance level of 0.05 in a two-sided test was used. 3 Results 3.1 Early-life PFOS exposure and phenotype changes in offspring Results showed that early-life PFOS exposure resulted in a subsequent reduction of body weight in 2- and 3-week-old offspring rats (  Supplementary Figure S1 Analysis of OGTT revealed a correlation of PFOS exposure with increased blood glucose levels during fasting and at 15 minutes in adult offspring rats, as illustrated in  Figure 1 p p Figure 1 Impact of PFOS exposure during early life on glucose tolerance, lipid profiles, and adipokines of 9-week-old offspring rats.

Each panel represents distinct conditions, with pathways listed vertically and rich factors or metabolite ratios on the horizontal axis. To validate the findings, qPCR analysis was conducted, and the results of all examined genes in qPCR analysis demonstrated a consistent expression pattern with the transcriptomic data (  Supplementary Figure S3 3.3 Alterations in the metabolomic profile Non-targeted UPLC-MS analysis of adult offspring liver generated 3350 ion fragments. The OPLS-DA model was utilized for analyzing metabolite differences between groups (  Figure 2  Supplementary Figure S4 Classification results from the HMDB database indicated that the differentiated metabolites due to PFOS exposure at dose of 0.03 mg/kg (negative ion mode) were primarily associated with glycerophospholipids, prenol lipids, fatty acyls, carboxylic acids and derivatives, steroids and steroid derivatives, organooxygen compounds, and imidazolopyrimidines (  Supplementary Figure S5 Further annotation and enrichment analysis of the DEMs using the KEGG database revealed metabolic pathway changes at dose of 0.03 mg/kg, primarily involving the altered pathways of primary bile acid biosynthesis and porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism in the negative ion mode, as well as the phospholipase D signaling pathway and choline metabolism in cancer in the positive ion mode (  Figures 3C, E  Figures 3D, F  Supplementary Table S3 3.4 Integrated multi-omics analysis An in-depth analysis of the DEGs and DEMs was applied using MetaboAnalyst 5.0.

Building upon previous epidemiological findings, this study aimed to establish an early-life exposure model in SD rats to unravel the detrimental effects of PFOS exposure during early development on the metabolic health of adult offspring. Our findings revealed significant disruptions in glucose homeostasis and alterations in adipokine profiles induced by early-life PFOS exposure. Through comprehensive analysis, we identified specific metabolic pathways, as well as corresponding genes and metabolites, that were perturbed by PFOS exposure. These mechanistic insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the metabolic toxicity induced by PFOS exposure and pave the way for further environmental regulation of PFOS. 4.1 Metabolic phenotype Previous studies showed dose-dependent reproductive toxicity of PFOS, with significant effects observed at higher doses. For example, a dose of 3.2 mg/kg·d of PFOS during pregnancy was found to significantly reduce the number of live births, prolong the pregnancy duration, and decrease the number of blastocysts. However, no significant embryotoxicity was observed in other exposure groups (0, 0.1, 0.4, 1.6 mg/kg·d) ( 26 27 28 29 This study found that 0.3 mg/kg·d PFOS exposure could increase FBG and OGTT 15min blood glucose levels in the offspring adult rats. FBG testing serves as a convenient screening method for diabetes ( 30 31 32 16 33 Adiponectin, a specific protein secreted by adipocytes, binds to G protein-coupled receptors and plays pivotal role in enhancing insulin sensitivity, regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and correcting hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance ( 34 35 36 Leptin, an adipokine produced by adipocytes, acts in opposition to adiponectin and is crucial in the development of insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes. The adiponectin/leptin ratio is a sensitive indicator for assessing the risk of insulin resistance, and cardiovascular diseases ( 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 4.2 Altered gene expression and relevant pathways Transcriptomic sequencing analysis using liver samples from adult offspring rats exposed to PFOS during early life revealed significant metabolic alterations primarily associated with parathyroid hormone (PTH) pathways and multiple pathways related to fatty acid metabolism, glycemic control, and insulin resistance. PTH is a vital hormone involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization. Dysregulated PTH secretion can lead to conditions such as primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, often accompanied by renal diseases. Elevated PTH levels may also impact cardiovascular health and the development of diabetes mellitus ( 44 45 As observed in this study, the effects of PFOS on pathways related to glucolipid metabolism involve several genes with significantly changed expression levels, such as Acot Elovl Irs2 G6pc Gck Gys2 Pik3r1 Pi3ka Socs3 Ppp1r3c Ppp1r3b Fasn Foxo1 Cpt1a Ldha Acot1 Acot2 Acot4 Acot3 Elovl2 Elovl5 Acyl coenzyme A thioesterases Acot 46 Elovl2 Elovl5 Elovl2 Elovl2 Elovl5 47 Irs2 G6pc Gck Gys2 Pik3r1 48 Socs Socs Socs3 49 Ppp1r3c Ppp1r3b 50 Fasn 51 Foxo1 G6p Pepck 52 Cpt2 53 54 4.3 Metabolomic alterations and metabolic pathways In this study, metabolomics analysis of livers in offspring adult rats revealed that PFOS exposure induced both porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, citrate cycle, and disturbances in lipid metabolism, involving mainly malic acid, α-ketoglutarate, glucuronide bilirubin, bile acid, glycine, levulinic acid, phenylalanine, L-urobilin, mesobilirubinogen, bilirubinogen, S-acetyldihydrothioctinamide-E, taurine. In addition to malic acid, extended carboxylic acid and levulinic acid have an impact on metabolic process of offspring rats ( 55 56 57 CYP7A1 58 59 60 61 62 The observation that different PFOS doses perturb distinct metabolic pathways—such as bile acid biosynthesis at 0.03 mg/kg and retinol metabolism and fatty acid elongation at 0.3 mg/kg—likely reflects non-linear, threshold-dependent toxicity mechanisms. PFOS, as a persistent environmental contaminant, is known to exhibit pleiotropic biological effects, and its toxicity often depends not only on dose but also on tissue accumulation, receptor binding affinity, and compensatory metabolic capacity. At lower doses (e.g., 0.03 mg/kg), PFOS may selectively engage high-affinity targets or signaling pathways, such as those regulating bile acid synthesis via FXR (farnesoid X receptor) or related nuclear receptors, leading to subtle but biologically meaningful metabolic disruptions ( 63 64 This dose-dependent switching of pathways suggests the existence of multiple toxicity mechanisms that are activated in a hierarchical manner, depending on PFOS exposure levels. It also supports the concept of dose thresholds, where specific toxic effects only emerge beyond certain concentrations. While our study does not allow for the precise determination of these thresholds, the distinct pathway profiles observed at different doses highlight the importance of considering non-linear dose-response relationships in PFOS risk assessment. 4.4 Integrative multi-omics Several co-enriched pathways induced by early-life PFOS exposure were identified in this study. In a recent systematic review paper, changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism induced by PFAS exposure were found in several studies, and are essential for vital biological membrane functions, while fatty acids and carnitines play a significant role in the energy supply pathway of fatty acid oxidation ( 65 66 67 68 Besides, significant changes in retinol metabolism was observed in 0.3 mg/kg group, which is consistent with a maternal-child paired study as they found that PFAS exposure in maternal blood was correlated with retinol metabolism ( 69 70 Several limitations merit consideration. Firstly, the non-targeted metabolomics approach used in this study might not have fully encompassed all metabolite varieties due to its inherent characteristics. The constraints of metabolite database might have led to the omission of specific metabolites from distinct pathways. Furthermore, a less stringent significance threshold was applied to determine differential metabolites and pathway enrichment. While this cut-off is commonly used to maximize the identification of differential metabolites for enrichment, it is important to consider the potential inflation of type I errors resulting from multiple testing. Secondly, differential metabolites and biological pathways identified in this study warrant further validation. More detailed metabolic measurements such as Insulin Tolerance Tests (ITT) need to be considered in future studies. Thirdly, omics analysis was limited to liver tissue. While the liver plays a central role in metabolic regulation, contributions from other organs such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and pancreas—particularly in relation to insulin resistance and adipokine secretion—were not directly assessed and warrant further investigation in future multi-tissue studies. Lastly, although this study has identified alterations at the gene expression and metabolic levels associated with early-life PFOS exposure, it remains possible that some phenotypic manifestations of disease outcomes—such as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, or obesity—may not fully emerge until later in life or during aging. Therefore, long-term, life-course investigations in offspring following early-life exposure are essential, particularly at environmentally relevant low-dose exposures that may produce subtle but persistent effects. Additionally, the role of epigenetic modifications—such as DNA methylation or histone remodeling—in key metabolic pathway genes warrants further investigation, as these changes may serve as long-lasting “molecular memories” that maintain metabolic dysregulation long after the initial exposure ( 71 72 In summary, findings in this study underscore the potential of early-life PFOS exposure to contribute to the development of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes later in life. They also highlight the importance of incorporating developmental exposure and low-dose effects into human health risk assessments. The results call for strengthened regulatory oversight and further research to better understand and mitigate the intergenerational impacts of PFOS and related environmental contaminants. 5 Conclusion Our study suggested that early-life PFOS exposure has the potential to affect glucose homeostasis in adult offspring rats, as indicated by elevated blood glucose level of OGTT and insulin level, but not a dose-response relationship. Several key co-enriched biological pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism and retinol metabolism, as well as DEGs and DEMs, were identified. Findings in this study provide valuable understanding into the fundamental biological mechanism that may contribute to the observed epidemiological associations.
