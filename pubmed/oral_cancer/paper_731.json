They were prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic. However, their immune response following COVID-19 vaccination remains unclear. We investigated short- and long-term immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with MMN and CIDP compared to controls. Methods: In a prospective observational study, patients with CIDP or MMN and matched controls were followed over 24 months. Controls were age- and sex-matched 1:9. Participants received COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with the Danish vaccination program. Primary outcomes were levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and virus-neutralizing capacity. A positive vaccine response was defined as IgG > 225 AU/mL and neutralizing capacity ≥ 25%. Results: We included 34 patients and 306 matched controls.

Introduction Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) are both immune-mediated polyneuropathies. Their exact pathogenesis is not fully understood. CIDP and MMN both involve different immunopathological mechanisms, including cellular, humoral, and complement-mediated pathways [ 1 2 3 4 For CIDP, first-line treatment options include immunoglobulin or corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are generally cheaper but associated with more long-term side effects, and treatment recommendations can vary by country [ 3 5 4 6 7 During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection could trigger or worsen polyneuropathy symptoms in patients with MMN and CIDP [ 8 9 10 11 With the rapid implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination program, concerns arose among patients and physicians regarding the potential reduction in COVID-19 vaccine response in patients receiving immune-modulating therapies compared to healthy individuals [ 12 13 14 13 15 Based on studies showing a diminished response to COVID-19 vaccinations for patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy compared to the general population, an intensified vaccination protocol was recommended for individuals with MMN and CIDP. As part of this strategy, booster vaccines were offered to these patient groups. The implementation of enhanced vaccine frequency in patients with CIDP and MMN was based on a theoretical rationale due to their use of immunosuppressive therapies. However, these recommendations were made without sufficient data to support this notion, and no disease-specific or treatment-specific evidence supported this approach. The immune response following COVID-19 vaccination in patients with MMN and CIDP who are receiving immunoglobulin treatment remains unknown. These patients are considered at risk of reduced vaccine efficacy and are offered booster vaccines. On the other hand, vaccination can, in rare cases, induce worsening of CIDP and MMN symptoms. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether this population demonstrates a sufficient humoral immune response. To this end, this study aimed to investigate short- and long-term immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination in patients with MMN and CIDP who received immunoglobulin compared to immunocompetent individuals. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Inclusion Criteria This prospective observational study was initiated at the Copenhagen Neuromuscular Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, in February 2021, inviting patients diagnosed with CIDP or MMN. It was conducted over a period of two years (2021–2023). COVID-19 vaccines were given according to the Danish vaccination program. Participation in this study did not affect the national vaccination strategy for any participant. The control group consisted of healthcare professionals from Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, and Herlev-Gentofte Hospital, who were also invited to participate in this study, as reported in previous studies [ 16 2.2. Outcomes and Definitions Information on administered vaccines and the number of vaccine doses was collected from the Danish Vaccination Register, a national register in Denmark, where all vaccinations are registered [ 17 Levels of SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and virus-neutralizing capacity were the primary endpoints. We used the same methodology as employed in previous studies [ 18 19 18 The antibody-neutralizing capacity was assessed using an in-house ELISA-based assay, which measured the degree of inhibition of the interaction between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) host receptor and the RBD using a methodology as previously employed [ 19 20 21 22 A positive vaccine response following COVID-19 vaccination was defined as SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies above 225 AU/mL and an antibody-neutralizing capacity of at least 25% inhibition. Nucleocapsid (N)-protein antibody detection was used to detect previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. N-protein antibodies were determined by electrochemiluminescence (Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Elecsys ® 2.3. Statistical Analysis Patients were matched to controls by age and sex, with a ratio of 1:9, using the cardinality method, with balance tolerability set to 0.1 for both age and sex. We performed a linear mixed-effects model with repeated measurements to investigate how the change in immune response differed among patients and controls. The primary outcome was IgG antibody levels, which were log-transformed before analyses. Fixed effects were follow-up visits and groups, defined as patient or control. Log-transformed IgG levels were modeled as a function of the visit and the interaction between the group and the visit. We included a random effect for each subject to account for the repeated measurements from the same participant. We assumed an unstructured covariance pattern for the random effects and fitted the model using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) method. Model assumptions were assessed through residual diagnostics, variance homogeneity checks, and convergence tests, all of which were satisfactory. Singularity checks confirmed an identifiable random-effects structure and a stable model fit. Continuous data were reported as medians with range and categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. Differences in characteristics were assessed with the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables. Fischer’s exact test was used for categorical variables when the counts were of less than five, while the Chi-squared test was applied when the counts exceeded five. IgG antibody levels and neutralization capacity were reported as the estimated rate ratios from the mixed-effects models. For clarity, we also report the mean difference in percentages derived from each estimated rate ratio. In addition, 95% confidence intervals (CI) and corresponding p p Sensitivity analyses for age, sex and the number of received vaccinations were conducted by adjusting for each variable separately in the mixed-effects model. Further, we examined the three-way interaction between the number of vaccines and group (patients and controls) and visit. Statistical analyses were performed in RStudio 4.2.0 using the following packages: “MatchIt”, “dplyr”, “Rglpk”, “LMMstar”, “lme4”, and “lmerTest”. Figures and graphs were created with RStudio 4.2.0 using the packages “ggplot2” and “lattice”. 3. Results 3.1. Study Population We included 34 patients, of whom 26 were diagnosed with CIDP and 8 with MMN. A total of 306 age- and sex-matched controls were included. There was a similar distribution of age ( p p p p p Table 1 During follow-up, N-antibody-verified COVID-19 infection was more frequently observed in patients with CIDP and MMN than in controls. SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 47% of controls and 62% of patients; however, the difference was insignificant ( p Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Table S2A Supplementary Table S2C 3.2. SARS-CoV-2 Anti-RBD IgG Levels SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG levels were compared across visits using a mixed-effects model. Compared to the baseline, we found an increase in IgG levels at all follow-up visits ( p Figure 1 Six months after the first vaccination, the IgG levels declined to 2465 AU/mL in the control group and 1309 AU/mL in the patient group. At the 12-month follow-up, the IgG levels increased to 17,774 AU/mL in controls and 11,896 AU/mL in patients. A decline in the IgG levels was observed at the 18-month follow-up (14,678 AU/mL for controls and 7694 AU/mL for patients), followed by an increase in the IgG levels at the 24-month follow-up (34,647 AU/mL for controls and 13,309 for patients) ( Figure 1 Differences in SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG levels between controls and patients were examined across visits. No differences between groups were observed at baseline (mean difference 30% [estimated rate ratio 0.70, 95%CI: 0.30–1.64], p p p p p p p p Sensitivity analyses were performed, excluding the patient who received CD-20-depleting treatment. No difference in SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG levels was found between patients with MMN and CIDP undergoing immunoglobulin therapy compared to controls, except at the 24-month follow-up, where controls had higher IgG levels (56% [0.44, 95% CI 0.29–0.66], p Adjusting for current COVID-19 infection, defined as the presence of N-antibody-verified COVID-19, increased the mean group difference in IgG levels with significant differences at the 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-ups. The infection-adjusted between-group IgG differences are presented in Supplementary Table S2B 3.3. Neutralization Capacity The neutralization capacity increased over time compared to the baseline for both groups. At baseline, the neutralization capacity was 8.5% in the controls and 12.7% in the patients. At the 3-week follow-up, the neutralization capacity increased to 38.5% in the control group and 35.0% in the patient group. By the 2-month follow-up, the levels reached 95.2% and 94.0%, respectively. At 6 months, the neutralization capacity declined to 92.0% in the controls and 81.6% in the patients. At 12 months, it increased to 98.0% and 95.8%, followed by 98.8% and 91.5% at 18 months. At the 24-month follow-up, the neutralization capacity was 97.8% in the control group and 89.3% in the patient group ( Figure 2 p p p p p p p Figure 2 Sensitivity analyses were performed, excluding the patient on CD-20-depleting treatment, with similar results. The control group had a higher neutralization capacity at the 6-month follow-up than patients with CIDP and MMN in immunoglobulin therapy (10.87%, 95%CI: 3.72–18.02, p p p Adjusting for current N-antibody-verified COVID-19 infection at sampling time did not affect the differences in the neutralization capacity between the two groups. 3.4. Responders to Vaccination Across all visits conducted during the 24 months following the first vaccine dose, 292 study participants showed a positive immune response, defined as SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG levels of at least 225 AU/mL and a neutralization capacity of at least 25% at any time point. Participants with previous natural COVID-19 infection were more likely to be vaccine responders (OR 39.4, 95% CI: 10.0–341.8, p One participant had missing values after week 3 and was excluded from further responder analyses. A total of 97.1% of patients with MMN and CIDP (32/33) demonstrated a positive vaccine response within the 24-month follow-up, characterized by SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG levels of at least 225 AU/mL and a neutralization capacity of at least 25%. The single vaccine non-responder received CD-20-depleting therapy during the follow-up period, whereas all other patients were treated with immunoglobulin. In total, 85% of the controls had had a vaccine response within 24 months (260/306). There was no change in the number of responders between patients and controls after 24 months (95%CI: 0.89–235.25, p Figure 3 However, at the 24-month follow-up visit alone, patients were less likely to be vaccine responders than the controls ( p Table 2 4. Discussion In this observational cohort study, patients with MMN and CIDP demonstrated short- and long-term immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination comparable to those of controls. All patients receiving immunoglobulin therapy met our definition of vaccine responders. However, our analysis revealed lower IgG antibody levels and lower neutralization capacity at 6, 18, and 24 months after the first vaccination in patients with MMN and CIDP compared to the control group. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination programs were rapidly implemented before sufficient data were available to determine whether the immune response to the vaccines was adequate across different patient groups. Studies suggest that many patient groups may exhibit a diminished humoral response to vaccination, which could potentially increase their risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This includes a study that found an impaired immune response in 362 patients with lymphoid malignancy, measured as low IgG antibody levels and a low neutralization capacity, compared to immunocompetent individuals, both short-term (within one year) and long-term (more than one year) after the first vaccination [ 16 13 23 15 Only one other study has examined the antibody response following COVID-19 vaccination in patients with immune-mediated polyneuropathies in immunoglobulin treatment. The study reported a reduced short-term antibody response, with lower IgG levels in patients 21 days after the initial vaccination compared to controls [ 24 Our study involves a more extended follow-up period than those of comparable studies investigating the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, the 24-month follow-up indicating a sufficient long-term immune response to COVID-19 vaccination cannot be directly compared to previous study results. However, the study investigating lymphoid malignancy reported a decrease in immune response 12 months after the first COVID-19 vaccination, whereas the study on patients with myasthenia gravis observed a delayed immune response compared to immunocompetent individuals 6 months post-vaccination. The differences between our study and previous studies do not appear to be related to methodological variations, as the patients originated from the same study cohort and antibody levels were measured using the same technique. Instead, the difference in results between the two studies and ours could be explained by other factors. First, the studies investigate different diseases. Second, the difference in immune responses following COVID-19 vaccination may also relate to the various treatments. Among the 57 patients with myasthenia gravis, most were treated with either azathioprine (51%) or low-dose glucocorticoids (14%) [ 15 16 25 26 27 12 28 Additionally, we found no difference in the number of responders between patients with CIDP and MMN compared to controls after 24 months. This suggests that while antibody levels and neutralization capacity are reduced in these patients, they still appear to maintain a sufficient immune response, highlighting the potential benefit of COVID-19 vaccination. When looking at the 24-month visit alone, fewer patients had a positive immune response. It is important to notice that natural COVID-19 infection, which was more prevalent in the patient group than the control group at 6-month and 12-month follow-up, can increase IgG and neutralization capacity levels without reflecting vaccine-induced immune response. While the observed reductions in antibody levels may not translate into clinically meaningful risks, targeted monitoring of patients with additional risk factors, such as those on concurrent CD20-depleting therapy, may be warranted. Furthermore, our results highlight that immunoglobulin therapy does not appear to impair vaccine efficacy, supporting its continued use in these patients during COVID-19 vaccination programs. Our study is the largest to date investigating the humoral immune response in patients with immune-mediated polyneuropathies undergoing immunoglobulin treatment. A key strength of this study is the long follow-up period of 24 months, making it possible to investigate both short- and long-term humoral immune responses in patients with immune-mediated polyneuropathies in immunoglobulin therapy. Another strength of the study is the data on N-protein antibodies, which makes it possible to investigate previous natural COVID-19 infections. There are also limitations to this study. A limitation of our study is that antibody levels were measured against the wild-type RBD using a fixed assay cut-off, which may not fully reflect protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Although our study is larger than previous studies, the number of patients is still relatively small. Most patients were vaccine responders, and only one patient was a non-responder, which limited our ability to perform sub-analyses of risk factors of vaccine non-response. However, the patient cohort is large enough to detect statistical differences in the long-term humoral immune response, unlike the previous study, which included only four patients. A positive immune response may result from a primary infection rather than vaccination. However, we consider N-antibody-confirmed COVID-19 infection a proxy for natural infection, and no statistical difference was observed between the two groups. Another limitation of our study is the sampling schedule, which may have missed peak immune responses following vaccination, potentially underestimating the maximal antibody levels achieved. Additionally, there are missing data as some patients and controls did not have blood samples taken at all seven planned visits. To account for the missing data, we applied a linear mixed model. We demonstrate that patients with CIDP and MMN have a positive immune response following COVID-19 vaccination and that all patients treated with immunoglobulin are vaccine responders. While healthcare systems and treatment protocols may vary, the fundamental immunological mechanisms underlying CIDP and MMN are consistent across populations. Therefore, we believe our findings are broadly applicable. More extensive studies are required to identify risk factors associated with non-response to COVID-19 vaccination, including distinguishing the effects of disease pathophysiology and immunosuppressant therapy. This knowledge is important for refining future vaccine strategies. It could help identify vulnerable subgroups among patients with CIDP and MMN who would benefit from booster doses while ensuring that other patients do not receive unnecessary additional vaccinations. 5. Conclusions Patients with CIDP and MMN demonstrated a positive humoral response following COVID-19 vaccination. While the SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels and neutralization capacity were lower in patients compared to those of controls at 6, 18, and 24 months, the proportion of non-responders did not differ between the two groups. All patients receiving immunoglobulin therapy demonstrated a positive vaccine response.

The model of the predicted mean, with 25% and 75% confidence intervals, is plotted against the observed individual IgG levels in AU/mL on a log10 scale. Observed data are represented by red circles for controls and blue triangles for patients. Predicted mean concentrations are shown as a red line for controls and a blue line for patients; the lines show back-transformed (exponentiated) model estimates on a log10 y y p p p Figure 2 Observed neutralization capacity and predicted neutralization capacity up to 2 years after initial COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CIDP and MMN and controls. The model of the predicted neutralization capacity with 25% and 75% confidence intervals is plotted with the observed individual neutralization capacity in percentages (%). Observed data are represented by red circles for controls and blue triangles for patients. Predicted neutralization capacities are shown as a red line for controls and a blue line for patients. Shaded areas around the lines indicate the confidence intervals for the predictions. The horizontal dotted line represents the lower threshold defined for a vaccine response.
