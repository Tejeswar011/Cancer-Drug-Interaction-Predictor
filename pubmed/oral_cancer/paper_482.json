Despite their established efficacy in reducing fracture risk, the most commonly used antiresorptive treatments, bisphosphonates and denosumab, have short‐ and long‐term risks that, coupled with their benefits and other unique characteristics, influence consideration for at least periodic discontinuation. Bisphosphonates retain their effects even after discontinuation due to their prolonged skeletal retention, whereas denosumab discontinuation is associated with a rapid rebound in bone turnover and increased fracture risk. There is controversy about how, when, and why to potentially stop these agents. We discuss both permanent and temporary discontinuation of long‐term treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab. We focus on the reasons and timing for discontinuation as well as strategies to mitigate future fracture risk.   pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025 Author disclosures and graphical abstract are available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.43179 Clinical challenge Two 70‐year‐old postmenopausal identical twins (Ms DMS and Ms BPS) were seen for a second opinion about their severe osteoporosis. Ms DMS had a vertebral fracture 12 years ago and experienced a wrist fracture in her fifties. She has been treated for nine years with denosumab at 60 mg subcutaneously every six months. Her twin sister has a history of two vertebral fractures 9 and 13 years ago, and she has been taking alendronate at 70 mg orally once a week for the past 15 years. Beyond age, menopausal status, and a family history of an early hip fracture in their mother, neither sister has additional major risk factors for fractures. They have both been reading about adverse effects related to long‐term osteoporosis treatment and are concerned about continuing their medications. Osteoporosis treatment considerations and why to consider stopping certain drugs Effective management of osteoporosis is critical to reducing the risk of fractures, which significantly impact the quality of life in older adults. Several pharmacologic treatments are available for the management of osteoporosis, each with distinct mechanisms of action and long‐term effects on bone metabolism. This perspective will be limited to issues surrounding the longer‐term use of the two most commonly used types of antiresorptive osteoporosis drugs: bisphosphonates and denosumab. Bisphosphonates and denosumab have been the cornerstone of osteoporosis management because of their wide availability and efficacy in reducing bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast activity, leading to improved bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced fracture risk.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14 The most concerning adverse events associated with both bisphosphonates and denosumab are atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). These adverse events are believed to stem, at least in part, from the profound and longer‐term suppression of bone remodeling. Although both conditions share a common pathophysiology related to the suppression of bone turnover, each has unique characteristics and potential mechanisms.  15 ONJ is characterized by exposed necrotic bone in the maxillofacial region, often following dental extractions or other invasive dental procedures. It is believed that prolonged suppression of bone turnover compromises the ability of the jawbone to repair microdamage and maintain vascularity, leading to localized necrosis. Additionally, factors such as local infection, reduced angiogenesis, and microbial biofilms play significant roles in the pathogenesis of ONJ.  16 AFFs occur along the subtrochanteric or diaphyseal regions of the femur and occur with minimal trauma. The pathogenesis involves oversuppression of bone turnover leading to reduced bone remodeling capacity, accumulation of microdamage, and altered bone material properties.  17 Both events are estimated to have an overall incidence of 1 of 1,000 to 1 of 10,000 in patients treated for osteoporosis.  18  19  19 In the complex clinical challenge we described, the approach to care for Ms DMS and Ms BPS varies greatly, based on their specific bone treatment history, even if the two sisters present with a somewhat similar health history and identical genetic background. A detailed bone medication history is essential in evaluating and managing osteoporosis. For Ms DMS, questions should focus on her adherence to denosumab, including whether she has missed or delayed any doses, given the rebound risk. For Ms BPS, the medical history should explore her adherence to alendronate over the years. Indeed, oral bisphosphonates, although effective, are well known for poor long‐term adherence due to their strict dosing requirements and potential gastrointestinal side effects. In addition to adherence, another challenge with oral bisphosphonates, particularly in older adult patients, is reduced gastrointestinal absorption. Bisphosphonates have inherently low bioavailability (~1%), and their absorption is further impaired by common factors in older adults, such as concurrent medication use (eg, proton pump inhibitors). Medical history should also include the evaluation of the need for future invasive dental procedures, particularly tooth extraction and intended dental implants, that might affect use and/or timing of antiresorptives due to risk of ONJ. How and when to discontinue antiresorptives Given their different mechanisms of action, we will discuss separately denosumab discontinuation and bisphosphonate drug holidays. The evidence supporting the decision‐making in continuing or stopping these therapies is summarized in Tables 1 2 Table 1 Bisphosphonate discontinuation: benefits, risks, and competing evidence * Benefits/rationale to discontinue Risks to discontinue/rationale to continue Protracted efficacy even after discontinuation (especially with alendronate or zoledronic acid–prolonged skeletal retention)  21  22  23  26 Residual fracture risk in high‐risk patients  22  33 Plateauing of BMD benefit after prolonged therapy (≈3–5 years) and similar fracture risk  21  22 Refracture risk during drug holiday  23  32  36 Risk of adverse effects related to treatment duration  18  32 Secondary mineralization might offer benefit beyond BMD increase  76  77 Reduced adverse effects upon stopping (ONJ, AFF)  18  19  33 – Temporary discontinuation (holiday)  23  33  36 – * AFF, atypical femoral fracture; BMD, bone mineral density; ONJ, osteonecrosis of the jaw.

Bisphosphonates Bisphosphonates can be classified based on the route of administration and, more importantly, based on their relative osteoclast inhibition potency, mostly determined by their affinity to the bone. Among the commonly used bisphosphonates—alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, and ibandronate—there are significant differences in their bone affinity, with zoledronic acid having the most affinity to bone and ibandronate and risedronate having the lowest.  20 Long‐term extension to the clinical trials of bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, have provided critical insights into their efficacy and the effects on treatment discontinuation. In the pivotal study of alendronate for postmenopausal participants with osteoporosis who continued alendronate treatment for up to 10 years showed significant and sustained increases in BMD. This was most notable at the lumbar spine, where after approximately five years of therapy, BMD essentially plateaued and persisted even after the drug was stopped for five years.  21  22 Risedronate, another oral bisphosphonate given weekly or monthly, exhibits a comparatively much shorter “tail effect” than alendronate. Specifically, although bone turnover and BMD in patients treated with alendronate returns to baseline levels over approximately five years, those treated with risedronate revert to baseline within approximately one year after stopping the medication, regardless of the treatment duration.  23  24 Zoledronic acid (also known as zoledronate), is another common bisphosphonate administered intravenously once a year. It also has an even longer tail effect, and participants who discontinued treatment after years still exhibited some residual benefits.  25  26  27 Although AFFs and ONJ have generated the greatest concerns, the most common bisphosphonate adverse events are gastrointestinal issues with oral administration and acute flu‐like symptoms (acute‐phase reaction) with intravenous administration.  15  28  29  30  31 The risk–benefit balance of bisphosphonates can be evaluated by the number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH). Although the NNT for preventing typical osteoporosis fractures is largely favorable in the early years of treatment, the NNH for serious adverse events such as AFF increases with extended therapy. In White women, bisphosphonate use corresponded to a NNT for preventing a typical fragility hip fractures of approximately 350 and 170 at 5 and 10 years, respectively.  32 The 2016 American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) guidance on drug holidays for patients on long‐term bisphosphonates offers emphasizes the balance between the benefits of fracture prevention with bisphosphonate and the need to reassess fracture risk over time  33 1  34 Figure 1 Approach to the management of postmenopausal women undergoing long‐term bisphosphonate therapy (adapted from Adler et al  33 BTMs, such as C‐terminal telopeptide (CTX), also can be used in monitoring the effectiveness of osteoporosis therapy and guiding decisions about drug holidays or treatment reinitiation. CTX reflects the rate of bone resorption, and its levels typically decrease with effective antiresorptive treatment, such as bisphosphonates. A significant drop in CTX from pretreatment levels, defined as more than the least significant change of 30%, suggests that an antiresorptive therapy is effective in suppressing bone turnover. CTX levels also can be used to monitor drug holidays. A common approach involves comparing baseline (predrug holiday) levels with those during the drug holiday. Two potential thresholds for interpretation include a return to baseline levels (pretreatment) or an increase of more than 30% from the end‐of‐treatment levels. Our approach to these two thresholds can be summarized as follows: (1) a return to pretreatment baseline levels or higher (ie, before any bone active drug has been started), indicating complete loss of antiresorptive effect or (2) an increase of more than 30% (above the least significant change of most BTMs) from end‐of‐treatment levels, suggesting excessive bone loss. Measuring BTMs at 6 to 12 months after stopping bisphosphonates might allow clinicians to determine whether therapy should be restarted earlier than BMD alone would suggest, particularly in high‐risk patients. Other BTMs, including urinary N‐telopeptide, can be used in similar ways, albeit urinary turnover markers are more subject to diurnal variations.  35 A corollary concern is that once bisphosphonates are discontinued for an extended period, fragility fractures may recur. US Medicare data were used to examine the fracture risk associated with various lengths of drug holidays among 81,427 women aged 65 years and older who had been adherent to bisphosphonate therapy (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronate) for at least three years.  36  36 Many consider a slightly longer drug holiday duration for zoledronic acid (18–24 months) compared to oral bisphosphonates (no more than 12–24 months for alendronate and perhaps even less for risedronate).  23  24 Denosumab Denosumab exhibits distinct effects on bone modeling and remodeling that may contribute to its unique safety profile. Unlike bisphosphonates, denosumab effects on bone remodeling are rapidly reversible, and a partial “escape” of remodeling occurs at the end of denosumab's pharmacologic effect, just before the next dose is due.  37  38  39 The problem of rebound following denosumab discontinuation is a significant concern in the management of osteoporosis. On denosumab discontinuation the beneficial effects of this agent are rapidly reversed, leading to a marked increase in bone turnover, that can surpass pretreatment levels. This corresponds to significant loss of BMD and a substantial increase in the risk of fractures, particularly multiple vertebral fractures.  8  40 At six months after the last denosumab injection, CTX rises rapidly, often exceeding baseline values.  10  11  12  12  40  40  41  42  43  41  44  41  45  46  47  48  45  41  49  50 The rapid and profound rebound in bone turnover could lead to such excessive and uncoordinated remodeling that it results in the perforation of trabeculae, in addition to just their thinning.  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 The European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) provided guidance on managing the discontinuation of denosumab to mitigate the rebound effect.  41  57  49  52  59  40 If clinically available, monitoring of BTMs after denosumab discontinuation can help tailor subsequent therapy more effectively. For patients showing significant increases in these markers, rapid BMD loss or not responding to a single dose of zoledronic acid, additional doses may be required. If BTMs are not available, then redosing as soon as three months or as late as six months after the first zoledronic acid dose is prudent. Moreover, the ECTS guidance on denosumab discontinuation may present challenges for implementation in the United States and other health systems due to payment concerns. Specifically, the recommendation for BMD assessment at six months after discontinuation, followed by a zoledronic acid infusion at the same time, is often not covered or reimbursed by some health plans. As an alternative approach, if BTMs remain elevated at 6 months, clinicians could consider adding alendronate for 6 months before administering a second dose of zoledronic acid 12 months after denosumab discontinuation. An alternative preliminarily tested approach to managing denosumab discontinuation involves gradual dose reduction.  60 Beyond ONJ and AFF, denosumab potential adverse events include an increased risk of infections, seen in some but not all denosumab studies and in one metanalysis showing more mostly minor respiratory tract infections.  61  62  63 There is an argument for continuing denosumab in patients who are responding well to treatment, particularly in terms of maintaining or improving BMD and reducing fracture risk. In contrast to bisphosphonates, there is no compelling evidence that denosumab becomes less effective or more dangerous with extended use. Therefore, continuing treatment can be a reasonable and effective strategy for long‐term management of osteoporosis. The decision to discontinue denosumab can be considered particularly when the patient's clinical status changes. For example, if a patient experiences a new fracture or if their BMD does not improve despite ongoing denosumab therapy, this could indicate that the treatment is no longer effective. For cases in which denosumab is no longer sufficient to prevent fractures, the best strategy might not be discontinuation or switching but rather the addition of another treatment, such as an osteoanabolic medication, on top of denosumab to increase bone strength and reduce fracture risk.  64  65  66 Adding romosozumab to ongoing denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis led to a significant increase in lumbar spine BMD and the bone formation marker procollagen type 1 N‐terminal propeptide, compared to continuing denosumab alone.  66  67  68 In contrast to adding, switching from denosumab to a PTH analog is not recommended. The rebound effect could be amplified by the stimulation of bone remodeling induced by bone anabolic agents, with negative effects on BTMs and BMD.  64  69  70  71  72  73  74 2 Figure 2 Approach to considering DMAB discontinuation (adapted from Tsourdi et al  41  64  66  68 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.43179/abstract Discussion As the data on bisphosphonate and denosumab efficacy, adverse effects, and the risks and benefits of stopping indicate, the clinical management of Ms DMS and Ms BPS presents a nuanced challenge. It underscores the importance of individualized osteoporosis therapy, especially concerning long‐term antiresorptive treatments. For Ms DMS, who has been on denosumab for more than eight years, the primary concern revolves around the potential rebound she will experience on discontinuation. A complete clinical evaluation should also assess for any signs of new fractures, height loss, or kyphosis, which may indicate undiagnosed vertebral fractures. Diagnostic testing should include a current BMD assessment via DXA, with comparisons to previous results to evaluate BMD trends. Additionally, measuring bone turnover makers can provide insights into her bone resorption status and treatment adherence. For many patients, particularly those at a higher risk of future fracture, denosumab discontinuation is not encouraged in patients with long‐term treatment (>2 years) given the potential for bone loss and the risk of multiple vertebral fractures. Given her history of vertebral and wrist fractures, and assuming her fracture risk remains high by DXA, the continuation of denosumab may be the most prudent course. If discontinuation is chosen, likely due to her strong preference, transitioning to a potent bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid is recommended to prevent postdenosumab rebound bone loss. Zoledronic acid should initially be administered at the time she is due for her next dose of denosumab. She should optimally have monitoring of BTMs three to six months after this first dose of zoledronic to guide the timing of the need for additional doses. If her BTMs remain elevated or if BTMs are not clinically available, it is reasonable to administer a second dose of zoledronic acid three to six months after her first dose. However, the effectiveness of even this potent bisphosphonate to fully prevent the rebound phenomenon is variable, and she should be counseled about these residual risks. Lastly, an alternative, but arguably minimally tested, approach might be to reduce the dosage of denosumab to 30 mg every 6 months and continue this dosage indefinitely of further reducing the dose to 15 mg and combining with zoledronic acid and then stopping the treatment within 18 months. However, little is known about potential adverse effects of reduced doses and their ability to control the rebound overshoot. Ms BPS has been taking alendronate for 15 years, a duration of treatment that should be generally discouraged due to the cumulative efficacy of bisphosphonates and concern of rare adverse effects, albeit ones that are more strongly associated with very prolonged bisphosphonate use. A detailed history should explore any previous drug holidays or temporary discontinuation (prescribed or self‐administered). This could help to tailor the length of a new, possible drug holiday. Clinical evaluation should include assessment for thigh or groin pain indicative of prodromal symptoms of AFF and oral examination for dental health status that might affect ONJ risk. Diagnostic evaluation should include a current DXA scan to assess BMD changes over time. If her BMD has remained stable or improved, and her fracture risk is now moderate to low, initiating a drug holiday might be considered. In addition, DXA images sometimes (if the window of interest is slightly lowered) can be used to screen for AFF and may add value. During her drug holiday, she should be under regular monitoring of BMD and BTMs. A significant decline in BMD or a significant increase in BTMs toward baseline levels may indicate the need to resume therapy. The duration of her drug holiday might vary but is typically less than one year. However, given her history of two vertebral fractures, Ms BPS would be considered by the ASBMR task force to be at higher risk for future fractures. Moreover, the ASBMR guidance suggests that all patients aged >70 to 75 years should be considered at high risk, independently from T score improvement. Thus, continuing bisphosphonate or switching to an alternate bone therapy could be justified despite her very prolonged duration of bisphosphonates. If she is agreeable to transitioning to a nonbisphosphonate therapy, options would include osteoanabolic agents such as teriparatide, abaloparatide, or romosozumab. Romosozumab, in particular, demonstrated significantly greater increases in bone mass and bone strength, as assessed by finite element analysis, compared to teriparatide.  75 Both patients require comprehensive fracture risk assessments incorporating clinical factors, BMD results, and using validated fracture risk calculators or algorithms. This assessment should consider the limitations of these expert panel generated recommendations for drug holidays and should be heavily guided by shared decision‐making. It is critical to discuss with these sisters the known benefits of fracture prevention against the risks of longer‐term risks of therapy with alendronate and the rebound risk when discontinuing denosumab. The sisters’ preferences are paramount, especially when concerns about adverse effects influence their willingness to continue treatment and when the evidence available is not of the highest level. Conclusions In conclusion, the management of Ms DMS and Ms BPS should be individualized. The treating clinician must consider their fracture histories, treatment responses, and individual concerns to devise a personalized treatment plan informed by the best available evidence and understanding of the biology of these two effective therapies that, like all drugs and biologics, are not without risk. Close monitoring through clinical evaluations, imaging, and laboratory tests are essential in optimizing osteoporosis care and minimizing the risks associated with osteoporosis therapy modifications.
