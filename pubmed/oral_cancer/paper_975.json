The oils were offered in their natural form or as nanoparticles. Daily doses of both natural and nano-encapsulated oils were calculated to provide each gilt with 3100 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 600 mg for the gilt and 250 mg for each foetus). Liver samples were collected from six piglets per gilt within 24 h after birth. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured spectrophotometrically, while DNA repair enzyme activities—formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (FPG), thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG), and N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG)—were assessed by Fpg protein digestion. SOD activity was lowest in piglets from gilts supplemented with algal oil, fish oil, and nano-encapsulated fish oil. Piglets born to the gilts that received algal oil nanoparticles showed higher activity (1.57 U/mg), while the highest activity was recorded in control piglets. CAT activity followed a similar trend; it was lowest in algal oil-supplemented mothers and highest in controls. GPx activity was lowest in piglets born to gilts that received algal oil (both forms) and highest in controls. The FPG activity in piglets birthed by PUFA-supplemented gilts was approximately half that of MPG and TDG, indicating reduced oxidative DNA damage. Both fish oil and algal oil, regardless of the form administered, effectively reduce oxidative stress in pregnant gilts and the associated DNA damage in the livers of their offspring. These findings suggest that maternal supplementation with long-chain n-3 PUFAs can protect newborn piglets from oxidative damage. Furthermore, regional disparities in access to functional foods underline the importance of targeted strategies that integrate local food systems and health planning to promote nutritional equity. maternal programming fish and algal oil nanoparticles newborn piglets oxidative stress antioxidant defence system spatial diffusion of nutritional innovation 2022/06/X/NZ9/00325 statutory funds of The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition Polish Academy of Sciences Minister of Science under the “Regional Excellence Initiative” This research was supported by funds from grant no. 2022/06/X/NZ9/00325 (Miniature-6) and the statutory funds of The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition Polish Academy of Sciences and Co-financed by the Minister of Science under the “Regional Excellence Initiative”. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Animal production exposes livestock to various stressors, including physiological (rapid growth rate, high meat yield), environmental (parturition and weaning, air quality, temperature, and stocking density) and nutritional (feed quality and availability) factors. At the molecular level, stress is associated with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, and disturbances in redox balance [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 5 7 8 According to Halliwell [ 9 10 2 2 2 2 5 11 2 2 12 2 2 2 2 13 14 According to some authors [ 15 16 17 3 18 A consequence of oxidative stress can be DNA lesions, which may occur even during the foetal stage of development [ 19 20 4 21 22 23 DNA lesions have high mutagenic potential, leading to autoimmune, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases; diabetes; cancer; and other age-related disorders [ 24 25 26 Long-chain n-3 PUFAs play an irreplaceable role in the proper growth and functioning of many bodily systems. Regular consumption of dietary supplements containing these fatty acids has been shown to improve cardiovascular function [ 27 28 29 27 30 31 32 33 34 35 There is abundant evidence that maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is directly related to foetal and neonatal development and may have long-term consequences for postnatal growth [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 31 44 45 46 20 Thus, the aim of the study was to determine the activity of key antioxidant defence enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) and DNA glycosylases involved in base excision repair (BER) (FPG, TDG, and MPG) in the liver of newborn piglets from mothers supplemented with fish oil, algal oil or their nanoparticle forms during pregnancy. We hypothesised that (i) supplementation of pregnant gilts with fish and algal oils rich in EPA and DHA would prevent oxidative stress in their foetuses/neonates, thereby influencing the activity of DNA glycosylases responsible for repairing oxidatively damaged bases; (ii) administration of these oils in nanoparticle form would strengthen these effects due to improved absorption [ 23 25 26 23 25 26 From the perspective of socio-economic geography and spatial planning, innovations in animal nutrition, such as supplementation with long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), may have significant implications for regional food systems and public health strategies. Access to PUFA-enriched meat products remains uneven among regions, particularly between highly industrialised agricultural zones and peripheral rural areas. Such disparities contribute to territorial health inequalities [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 2. Results The level of oxidative stress and the activity of the antioxidant defence system in newborn piglets (on their first day of life) were modulated by supplementing pregnant gilts with fish and algae oils, administered either in natural form or as nanoparticles. Liver MDA content, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx), and DNA repair enzymes (FPG, MPG, and TDG) were measured. The MDA content in the liver of newborn piglets and differences between treatment groups are shown in Figure 1 Table 1 Figure 1 The activity of SOD1 in the treatment groups is shown in Figure 2 Table 1 p Figure 2 CAT activity in the liver of newborn piglets differed between treatment groups ( Figure 3 Table 1 p Figure 3 The relationship between treatment groups for glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activity was similar to that observed for the CAT enzyme ( Figure 4 Table 1 p Figure 5 Table 1 The results demonstrate that oxidative DNA damage in the liver of newborn piglets, measured as oxidatively modified guanine (8-oxoG) removed by FPG, was almost two-fold lower in piglets born to gilts supplemented with either form of fish or algal oil compared to controls (0.559 vs. 1.042%; p The activity of the MPG enzyme, which repairs oxidatively modified adenine (ethenoadenine, εA), indicated significant differences in genomic DNA damage between treatments ( p FPG activity relative to MPG, expressed as the FPG/MPG ratio ( Figure 5 Table 1 p Although the core experimental results concern biochemical and physiological indicators in neonatal piglets, they have broader implications for regional food systems. Reduced oxidative stress and enhanced DNA repair in piglets from supplemented gilts imply the potential to produce meat with improved health-promoting properties. However, this potential must be considered in terms of spatial equity: regions with better-developed logistics, higher farmer awareness, and stronger institutional support are more likely to adopt such practices, while less developed areas may lag behind, exacerbating existing spatial inequalities in the production and availability of functional foods. 3. Discussion 3.1. Level of Oxidative Stress The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that maternal supplementation of gilts with algal and fish oil reduced oxidative stress in their newborn offspring, as evidenced by the lower MDA content in liver tissue. However, the effect of algal oil supplemented in the form of nanoparticles was slightly weaker than that of natural fish oil and natural algal oil. The literature reports on the influence of n-3 PUFAs on oxidative stress are ambiguous. Several studies [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 43 53 54 55 56 9 39 9 3.2. Activity of Antioxidant Defence Enzymes The antioxidant defence system relies on endogenous enzymatic and non-enzymatic components that act collectively against free radicals and their damaging effects on cells. Depending on their mode of action, antioxidants are classified into successive lines of defence [ 5 4 Maternal supplementation with fish and algal oils reduced liver SOD1 activity in newborn piglets from all supplemented groups. Depending on the type of oil and its form of administration, enzyme activity was 2.44 to 2.0 times lower than in the control group. Liver SOD2 activity was also decreased in piglets from gilts supplemented with fish and algal oils, regardless of the form of application. However, the activity of this enzyme showed significantly greater variation in the experimental groups. Importantly, SOD2 activity was higher in piglets whose mothers received nano-encapsulated oils compared to those receiving natural oils, with the highest activity observed in the nano algal oil group. The literature on the effects of maternal supplementation with long-chain PUFAs during pregnancy on SOD activity in newborns offspring is limited and inconsistent, and mainly focused on umbilical cord blood measurements. In human studies, no significant differences in SOD activity were found in umbilical vein or artery blood between neonates of DHA-supplemented mothers and controls [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 56 43 Hepatic CAT activity in newborn piglets was reduced when their mothers were supplemented with either fish or algal oil. Depending on the type and form of the oil, CAT activity was 1.34 to 1.52 times lower than in the control group. The recent literature on the effects of maternal long-chain PUFA supplementation during pregnancy on CAT activity in newborn offspring remains limited. A similar—though statistically non-significant—trend was observed by García-Rodríguez et al. [ 54 54 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 56 The current results indicate that GPx activity in the livers of newborn piglets from mothers with fish or algal oils during pregnancy (regardless of the method of administration) was downregulated. A stronger effect was observed in groups supplemented with natural algal oil and its nano-encapsulated form. Contrary to our outcomes, García-Rodríguez et al. [ 54 54 43 56 43 53 3.3. Activity of DNA Repair Enzymes FPG enzyme cleaves and removes 8-oxoG DNA lesions [ 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 25 39 62 64 63 The main distinction between this study and existing literature lies in our focus on the liver as the target organ for assessing antioxidant capacity, DNA damage, and repair enzyme activity, while majority of previous studies have analysed blood or other tissues. To determine these parameters, measurements of SOD, CAT, GPx, BER pathway enzymes (FPG, MPG, TDG), and MDA, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, were selected to evaluate these aspects comprehensively. When antioxidant and DNA repair systems are not maintained at optimal levels, they can act as physiological stressors, inducing somatogenic stress. Therefore, ensuring that pregnant gilts receive an appropriate PUFA-rich diet is crucial for the development of healthy, disease-free piglets. This is particularly important given that the global population is projected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, a 20% increase compared to today [ 70 71 71 72 73 74 75 76 71 72 73 74 75 77 78 Pig feed producers are currently facing several challenges that affect the economics of pig production. Changing market conditions, environmental regulations, and geographic factors are increasing the costs of agricultural operations. Profitability on farms can be improved through foetal programming using feeds prepared on-site, which can reduce production costs by up to 20%. However, it is especially important to balance these mixtures and supplement them with protein concentrate premixes and an appropriate content of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. The inclusion of fats rich in n-3 long-chain fatty acids in the nutrition of pregnant sows not only benefits the health of their offspring, but also reduces production costs during early postnatal period, a phase that is particularly challenging and cost-intensive for breeders. Moreover, the results of this work could have implications for the nutrition of pregnant women, potentially with regard to improving the health of human newborns. Widespread integration of long-chain fatty acids into maternal diets could thus serve as a powerful tool in public health, bridging agricultural innovation with human well-being. 3.4. Mechanisms Underlying Reduced Activity of Antioxidant and DNA Repair Enzymes The reduction of oxidative stress by long-chain n-3 PUFAs has been confirmed by decreased concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and F2-isoprostanes, which are reliable markers of in vivo oxidative stress both in neonatal plasma and during early postnatal growth [ 65 66 67 44 68 55 69 79 80 80 31 41 31 81 9 54 82 39 41 83 84 85 Contrary to the initial hypotheses of this study, supplementation of pregnant gilts with fish and algal oils in nanoparticle forms had a less beneficial effect on oxidative stress in their offspring compared to the natural form of these oils. This was evidenced by higher hepatic MDA levels and increased activity of antioxidant defence enzymes (particularly SOD2 and MPG). The weaker performance of nano-encapsulated forms may result from nanoparticles’ natural tendency to aggregate, which can alter their physiochemical properties, reactivity, fate, transport, and biological interactions, including their bioavailability and absorption [ 49 77 86 87 88 89 90 91 86 87 88 39 89 90 3.5. Socio–Spatial Diffusion of Nutritional Innovation The application of n-3 PUFAs in livestock production can be regarded as a sustainable agrotechnological innovation. Its adoption and spatial diffusion depend not only on biological efficacy but also on regional infrastructure, producer knowledge, and institutional support. From a spatial planning perspective, tools such as Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models offer valuable frameworks for understanding how such innovations can spread unevenly across space [ 70 77 86 92 93 94 95 96 91 Proper, balanced, and standardised nutrition is crucial for sow productive performance. Sows with high genetic potential and large litters can successfully raise their offspring only in optimal environmental conditions. They must receive adequate nutrition, appropriate care, maintain good health, and be housed under high-welfare conditions, which include limited stress, sufficient living space, individual housing in the farrowing room until pregnancy is confirmed, and group rearing at other times. Factors such as lighting, temperature, humidity, noise, air quality, and the spatial arrangement of sows, along with geo- and microclimatic conditions, all contribute positively to their behaviour and well-being. The daily dose of natural oils, including their nanoparticle forms, was calculated so that each gilt received 3100 mg of DHA (600 mg for gilt and 250 mg per foetus). The activity of the SOD enzyme was generally similar across groups, although it was lower in piglets born to gilts supplemented with algal oil, fish oil and nano fish oil; higher in piglets from the gilt supplemented with nano algal oil; and highest in control animals. CAT activity followed a similar pattern, with the lowest values observed in piglets from gilts receiving algal oil and the highest in the control group. GPx activity was lowest in piglets from gilts supplemented with both forms of algal oil; higher in those from gilts receiving fish oil; and highest in the control group. Similarly, FPG enzyme activity in the liver of piglets from gilts supplemented with both fish and algal oils was almost half that of the control group. MPG activity was reduced in all supplemented groups compared with controls, and TDG activity was also lower in piglets born to gilts receiving either oil, regardless of its form. These results indicate that maternal supplementation with long-chain n-3 PUFAs modulates the antioxidant defence system and DNA repair enzyme activity in the liver of newborn piglets, with natural oils generally exerting a stronger effect than their nanoparticle counterparts. The geographical implications of this study highlight the importance of regionalised food policy strategies that address spatial health inequalities and ensure equitable access to functional foods, such as PUFA-enriched pork [ 97 97 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Ethics All procedures were conducted in accordance with Polish Animal Protection Act and were approved by the II Local Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation of Warsaw University of Life Sciences, SGGW, Warsaw, Poland (Resolution WAW2/040/2023) from 19 April 2023. The experiment was designed to minimise the number of animals whilst maintaining high statistical power according to the principles of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement). 4.2. Animals’ Housing and Feeding The study focused on the offspring of five gilts (first pregnancy). Pregnant gilts (Polish Landrace) were purchased from the Animal Breeding Centre in Chodeczek, Poland. After pregnancy was confirmed, the animals were transported to the Laboratory of Large Animal Model of the Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Science. The gilts were transported from the breeding farm to the experimental pigsty at the Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Jabłonna after pregnancy which was confirmed by a veterinarian (at 5 weeks of gestation). The animals were transported in specially adapted vehicles in accordance with applicable Polish law. After an adaptation period, gilts were fed a standard diet with a nutritional value adapted to their physiological condition (i.e., early pregnancy or late pregnancy) [ 7 Table 2 After confirmation of the pregnancy, each gilt received a different fat supplement: fish oil, algae oil, fish oil nanoparticles, or algae oil nanoparticles. One gilt did not receive any fat supplements containing long-chain fatty acids and was considered as the control gilt. Fish oil and algae oil (in both forms) were added individually to the feed just before feeding. Due to the lack of dietary recommendations for pregnant sows regarding the daily intake of docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 n-3, DHA), its amount was determined based on the recommendations for pregnant women. Thus, daily dose of natural oils, also in the form of nanoparticles of these oils, was calculated so that each gilt received a DHA dose of 3100 mg (600 mg for gilt and 250 mg for each foetus × 10 = 2500 mg). The number of developing foetuses was estimated at 10. Nanoparticles of fish and algal oils were prepared according to the method described by [ 23 The fish and algal oils used in the study were purchased from NORSAN Poland LLC, a certified producer of oils from arctic cod and algae. The composition of the oils is given in Table 3 Till day 90 of pregnancy, the gilts were kept in individual pens (2.75 m 2 2 7 4.3. Measurement of the Activity of Antioxidant Defence Enzymes All proteins were isolated by RIPA lysis buffer according to protocol [ 46 SOD activity was determined spectrophotometrically in a 48-well plate by the method described by Fridovich [ 11 6 2 CAT activity was determined spectrophotometrically in a 48-well plate by the method outlined by Aebi [ 47 6 48 v v w v 2 2 7 49 2 2 The total enzymatic activity of GPx was determined using the method of Hopkins and Tudhope [ 50 Determinations of all three enzymatic activities were performed separately using the Freedom EVO ® 4.4. Measurement of the Activity of DNA Repair Enzymes: Formamidopirymidyno-DNA Glycosylase (FGP), Thymine-DNA Glycosylase (TDG), and N-Methylpurine DNA Glycosylase (MPG) Was Described in Detail in the Work by Kowalczyk [ 25 The genomic DNA from all liver samples was isolated from 2ml of fresh medium by using a New England Biolabs Kit (Labjot, Warsaw, Poland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The obtained DNA was digested by Fpg protein according to the manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA cat no. M0240S, 8000 U/mL) as follows: Fpg protein was diluted 50-fold with 10× NEB buffer (provided by the Fpg protein manufacturer) and mixed with 100× BSA solution (also supplied with Fpg protein). Next, 8 µL of purified genomic DNA was mixed with 2 µL of Fpg solution and 2 µL of NEB buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Control bacterial DNA (incubation without the tested compounds) and digested and undigested genomic DNA (incubated with the analysed compounds) samples were evaluated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically from the A 260 280 The use of Fpg protein known as 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase or (formamidopyrimidine [fapy]-DNA glycosylase) is important because it removes a broad spectrum of oxidized and alkylated bases from double-stranded DNA: 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoguanine), 8-oxoadenine, unsubstituted and substituted imidazole ring-opened purines introduced into DNA by hydroxyl radicals (e.g., FapyG, FapyA), as well as by chemical carcinogens, including anticancer drugs (e.g., Fapy-7MeG, Fapy-7EtG, Fapy-7aminoethylG, aflatoxin B 1 25 25 The results were estimated based on a comparison of samples digested and non-digested with Fpg protein. The percentage of cleavage was determined based on the change in forms resulting from the enzymatic activity of the digested sample, relative to the DNA-binding Fpg protein. From the literature data, it is known that the degree of genomic DNA damage above three percent by Fpg protein indicates strong genomic DNA damage to all oxidized and modified guanines occurring as 8-oxoguanine, fapy-adenine (FapyG), and fapy-guanine (FapyA). 4.5. Measurement of Malondialdehyde (MDA) The measurement method was described in detail by Bird and Draper [ 51 52 A commercially available MDA solution (Merk) was used and serially diluted in purified water to prepare the standard curve. The concentrations of 50–25–12.5–5–2.5–1.25–0.625 nmol/mL were used. To 25 μL of each standard or sample, 500 μL of the 2 M AcONa Buffer pH 3.5 + 0.2% TBA was added and incubated at 95 °C for 1 h. At this stage, lipoperoxides underwent hydrolysis, releasing MDA molecules, which then bound with two TBA molecules to form the MDA-TBA 2 2 4 2 Then, 200 μL of the supernatant was pipetted into a new tube, and 200 μL of the 50 mM KH 2 4 The level of malondialdehyde was calculated as follows: C = F × 6.41 × A. C: Concentration, F: Dilution factor, A: Absorbance 4.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica (version 13.1, StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). The examined characteristics in different groups are presented as mean values. All the results were analysed with one-way ANOVA. When the F ratio was significant, Tukey’s honest significant difference post hoc analysis was performed. Statistical significance was set at p p 4.7. Spatial Embedding of the Experiment The experimental phase of this study was conducted in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (north-central Poland), a region characterized by a moderate level of agricultural industrialization and a significant share of pig farming. The economic structure and location of the farms provide a relevant spatial framework for assessing the transferability of dietary innovations across diverse agricultural regions in Poland. From a spatial modelling perspective, the regional deployment of PUFA-based supplementation in animal husbandry could be optimized using GIS tools and spatial clustering techniques, enabling the identification of priority zones for technological diffusion and implementation [ 91 93 5. Conclusions The results of the present study indicate that supplementation of pregnant gilts with algal and fish oils, whether in natural or nanoparticle form, effectively reduces oxidative stress and associated DNA damage in their newborn offspring. Consequently, the activity of the antioxidant system, assessed through the levels and activity of antioxidant and DNA repair enzymes, is lower. The findings also reveal that oils administered in nanoparticle form were less effective than their natural counterparts. Further research using molecular approaches in animal models of programmed nutrition will enable the development of targeted nutritional strategies with direct implications for humans. Inadequate energy balance or insufficient intake of nutrients with an appropriate energy value can significantly affect foetal development. Nutritional programming for humans links maternal diet during pregnancy with the future health and quality of life of the child. A well-balanced diet can reduce the risk of diseases during pregnancy and support optimal child development. The aim of this research is to guide the development of nutritional programmes that support optimal foetal growth while delivering significant health-promoting benefits. Further interdisciplinary research is required to explore how territorial factors influence the adoption of nutritional innovations in agriculture. We propose mapping regional readiness for adopting PUFA-enriched feed using spatial indicators, e.g., farm density, infrastructure, and access to veterinary services; assessing consumer access to PUFA-rich meat products through analyses of food deserts and socio-demographic data; integrating spatial health indicators with supply chain modelling to guide evidence-based policymaking in food and health sectors; and incorporating spatial equity measures into nutritional programming to ensure that foetal health benefits from maternal dietary interventions are accessible across all regions. This geographical perspective complements the biological findings of the study and provides a roadmap for equitable innovation in sustainable animal production and public health nutrition.
