Introduction Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a clinically aggressive and molecularly heterogeneous malignancy, which is characterized by a pronounced tendency for early recurrence and distant metastasis as well as significantly worse survival outcomes compared to other breast cancer subtypes [ 1 2 Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation process that maintains cellular homeostasis by selectively eliminating damaged organelles and misfolded proteins [ 3 4 4 5 4 5 6 7 8 Notably, TNBC often exhibits elevated autophagic flux, which functions as a critical survival strategy that enables cancer cells to withstand metabolic stress and thrive in the nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment [ 9 10 11 In this review, we systematically integrate current knowledge on ARPs in TNBC, elucidating their multifaceted roles in tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. By critically evaluating the underlying molecular mechanisms, we provide a comprehensive assessment of their dual potential as both actionable therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers for clinical application. 2. Molecular Regulatory Network of Autophagy Generally, autophagy is mechanistically categorized into three main types, including macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) [ 3 4 3 4 12 13 The autophagic cascade occurs through a series of sequential and tightly regulated stages, including initiation via autophagy-related protein kinase complexes, phagophore nucleation and membrane elongation, culminating in autophagosome formation, autophagosome–lysosome fusion generating degradative autolysosomes, and subsequent cargo degradation in lysosomes [ 3 4 14 15 16 Figure 1 Autophagy initiation is principally governed by the unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) complex, which integrates opposing signals from the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways [ 16 17 18 17 19 17 The nucleation of autophagosomes is governed by the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, which consists of the catalytic subunit VPS34, the scaffold protein Beclin-1, the autophagy-specific adaptor ATG14L, and additional regulatory subunits [ 20 9 21 22 23 24 The final step in autophagy involves selective cargo recognition via LC3-II-interacting receptors, SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor)-mediated fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome (primarily through STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 complexes), and formation of degradative autolysosomes where lysosomal hydrolases process sequestered cargo for macromolecular recycling [ 20 25 26 27 Notably, beyond their canonical functions in autophagy regulations, many ARPs exhibit pleiotropic functions through participation in diverse cellular signaling pathways independent of autophagy [ 28 29 30 3. Context-Dependent Roles of ARPs in TNBC Progression Emerging evidence reveals that ARPs exert diverse functions in TNBC through both canonical autophagy-dependent pathways and non-canonical mechanisms. These multifaceted roles include metabolic reprogramming to fulfill biosynthetic demands and promote stress adaptation, potentiation of invasive potential and metastatic spread, dynamic modulation of the tumor microenvironment, and maintenance of cancer stem cell properties. Through these coordinated actions, ARPs drive TNBC pathogenesis at multiple levels from sustaining cellular homeostasis to accelerating tumor progression and therapeutic resistance ( Figure 2 3.1. Regulation of Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis by ARPs in TNBC ARPs serve as multifunctional regulators that integrate basal metabolic homeostasis with oncogenic signaling networks in TNBC. Through dynamic crosstalk with cell-cycle checkpoints, apoptotic machinery, and metabolic sensors, these proteins establish sophisticated control circuits governing cancer cell proliferation and survival. It has been documented that Beclin-1, a core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex essential for autophagy initiation [ 31 32 33 33 34 The mTOR pathway serves as a master regulator that coordinately suppresses autophagy while promoting cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression [ 35 17 36 35 37 38 ARPs also play a pivotal role in modulating the apoptotic threshold of TNBC cells through dual regulatory mechanisms. For instance, it has been shown that ATG7, a core autophagy-related gene encoding protein that is indispensable to classical degradative autophagy [ 39 40 41 Collectively, these findings position selective ARPs as clinically actionable targets for TNBC therapy. By precisely modulating key nodes in autophagic networks, particularly those governing proliferative signaling and stress adaptation, we may develop innovative treatment strategies to disrupt tumor survival mechanisms while overcoming therapeutic resistance. This approach holds significant promise for addressing the critical unmet need in TNBC management, where current therapeutic options remain limited. 3.2. Regulation of Invasive and Metastatic Potential of TNBC Cells by ARPs TNBC exhibits enhanced invasive and metastatic potential with significantly higher rates of distant metastasis at diagnosis than other breast cancer subtypes [ 1 42 4 43 44 45 The serine/threonine kinase ULK1, while best characterized for its role in autophagy initiation [ 16 17 18 46 47 48 47 48 The molecular chaperone HSPA8, a critical regulator of selective autophagy [ 13 49 50 51 52 The autophagy-metastasis network in TNBC involves multiple additional regulatory components that orchestrate distinct aspects of metastatic progression ( Figure 3 53 54 3.3. Regulation of Cancer Cell Stemness by ARPs in TNBC Cancer stem cells (CSCs) constitute a critical cellular subpopulation that drives therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and metastatic progression in TNBC [ 55 56 Recent studies reveal that multiple ARPs exert distinct effects on CSC properties in TNBC through diverse molecular mechanisms. For instance, autophagy-related protein 2 homolog B (ATG2B) serves as a critical regulator of autophagic flux that constrains CSC properties in TNBC through its essential role in autophagosome biogenesis and maturation [ 57 58 58 59 Collectively, these findings demonstrate how oncogenic signaling networks interface with autophagy pathways to coordinate malignant progression and stem cell plasticity in TNBC. These coordinated actions establish an integrated “autophagy–stemness” axis that critically governs CSC self-renewal, differentiation plasticity, and therapeutic resistance. Targeted disruption of this network, either by selectively inhibiting pro-stemness autophagy factors or inducing the degradation of stemness markers, offers a promising therapeutic strategy to deplete the CSC pool, reduce tumor aggressiveness, and overcome therapeutic resistance in TNBC. This approach may yield novel combinatorial therapies that simultaneously target bulk tumor cells and the CSC niche. 3.4. Regulation of Tumor Immune Microenvironment by ARPs in TNBC The tumor immune microenvironment constitutes a critical determinant of TNBC progression and therapeutic responsiveness [ 60 61 Accumulating evidence shows that ARPs exert a complex dual regulatory role in modulating the immune microenvironment of TNBC. In this context, glycolytic restriction triggers ULK1-dependent autophagic degradation of liver-enriched activator protein (LAP), thus suppressing myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment to enhance CD8 + 62 63 64 65 + + 66 67 Beyond its established role in adaptive immunity, emerging evidence reveals that ARPs critically modulate innate immune signaling cascades. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34) triggers a robust activation of the STING-dependent DNA sensing pathway, inducing innate immune activation through natural killer (NK) cell and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment to create an immunogenic tumor microenvironment [ 68 In summary, ARPs orchestrate complex, bidirectional immunomodulatory effects within the TNBC microenvironment through multiple interconnected mechanisms. These proteins function as molecular rheostats that can either potentiate or suppress antitumor immunity depending on specific autophagic substrates degraded, cellular stress contexts, and immune cell populations involved. This complex regulation highlights the need for precision autophagy modulation in immunotherapy, requiring dual assessment of tumor autophagic activity and immune contexture to maximize efficacy while preventing immunosuppressive side effects. 4. Regulation of Therapeutic Responsiveness by ARPs in TNBC ARPs serve as critical determinants of therapeutic responsiveness in TNBC, exhibiting dual roles in therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. On one hand, they facilitate chemoresistance and radioresistance by activating protective autophagy to eliminate therapy-induced cytotoxic damage and promote cellular repair. On the other hand, these proteins modulate immunotherapy efficacy through two key mechanisms, including direct regulation of immune checkpoint molecules (e.g., PD-L1 trafficking and degradation) and dynamic remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment. A comprehensive understanding of these context-dependent mechanisms is essential for developing precision treatment strategies that either inhibit or harness autophagy to overcome therapeutic resistance in TNBC ( Figure 4 4.1. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy continues to serve as the foundation of systemic therapy for TNBC, particularly in neoadjuvant and metastatic treatment paradigms [ 69 70 71 9 Anthracyclines, particularly doxorubicin (DOX), remain cornerstone chemotherapeutics for TNBC, with their clinical effectiveness significantly modulated by autophagy regulation [ 72 52 73 74 75 76 77 In addition, resistance to microtubule-targeting agents, such as paclitaxel (PTX), continues to pose a significant clinical challenge in TNBC treatment [ 78 79 66 80 81 82 Beyond anthracyclines and microtubule-targeting agents, autophagy critically regulates TNBC chemosensitivity to other agents. For instance, eEF2K inhibition activates AMPK-mediated autophagy, dramatically increasing cisplatin sensitivity in TNBC cells [ 83 Emerging evidence reveals that non-coding RNAs orchestrate chemotherapy responses in TNBC through autophagy regulatory networks. For instance, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DDIT4-AS1 increases paclitaxel sensitivity by inhibiting mTOR signaling to downregulate autophagy effectors, including LC3-II and ATG5 [ 84 85 4.2. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy (RT) serves as a cornerstone treatment for local tumor control and multimodal therapy in TNBC. The primary cytotoxic effects of RT are mediated through three key mechanisms, including induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and initiation of lipid peroxidation cascades, which collectively induce irreversible tumor cell death [ 86 87 88 TNBC cells often acquire radioresistance by activating protective autophagy pathways, which provide survival advantages during RT [ 30 89 90 91 92 93 Beyond their canonical roles in autophagy, several ARPs significantly influence radiotherapy response through distinct molecular mechanisms. Genetic silencing of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key regulator of autophagy-related gene expression, significantly enhances radiosensitivity in TNBC. This effect is mediated primarily through the disruption of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, leading to catastrophic accumulation of ROS and subsequent induction of oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis [ 94 95 96 4.3. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy has fundamentally transformed the therapeutic landscape for TNBC, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) emerging as a breakthrough modality, particularly in advanced and metastatic disease. These agents exert their antitumor effects by disrupting tumor-mediated immunosuppressive mechanisms, thereby reinvigorating cytotoxic T cell function and restoring endogenous antitumor immunity [ 97 98 99 Autophagy significantly influences immunotherapy outcomes by modulating distinct cell death pathways. For instance, the CMA-associated protein HSPA8 directly governs ferroptosis sensitivity by facilitating the lysosomal degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Notably, HSPA8 depletion leads to GPX4 stabilization, conferring tumor cell resistance to ferroptosis and ultimately compromising PD-1 blockade efficacy [ 100 + 65 ARPs further regulate immunotherapy responses through microenvironmental signaling pathways. HMGB1, a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) released during autophagy, triggers proinflammatory cytokine secretion that paradoxically fosters an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGB1 not only attenuates this cytokine storm but also enhances T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and synergizes with PD-1 blockade therapy [ 101 Additionally, emerging evidence reveals that mitophagy serves as a key regulatory mechanism controlling PD-L1 protein turnover. The mitochondrial AAA + 102 103 In summary, autophagy-related proteins orchestrate TNBC immunotherapy responses through a multifaceted regulatory network, influencing immune checkpoint expression, tumor cell death pathways, and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Strategic modulation of autophagy pathways in combination with immunotherapy represents a promising therapeutic paradigm to enhance response rates and achieve sustained clinical benefits in TNBC treatment. 5. ARPs as Biomarkers in TNBC ARPs exhibit temporally regulated, stage-dependent expression patterns across the TNBC disease continuum, establishing their dual role as both pathogenic drivers and clinically exploitable biomarkers. These molecular signatures provide enhanced early detection through distinct proteomic fingerprints, refined molecular classification beyond conventional histopathology, prognostic stratification via strong associations with metastatic progression and survival outcomes, and predictive capacity for chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy response. This multidimensional clinical utility positions ARPs as transformative tools for precision oncology, enabling data-driven therapeutic decision-making from diagnosis through metastatic disease management ( Table 1 5.1. Diagnostic Value of ARPs in TNBC ARPs display unique subtype-specific expression patterns in TNBC, serving as powerful molecular discriminators that reliably distinguish TNBC from both normal breast tissue and other breast cancer subtypes. A particularly notable example is ATG7, which shows marked specific downregulation in TNBC relative to other subtypes of breast cancer and normal breast tissue [ 40 5.2. Prognostic Significance of ARPs in TNBC ARPs exhibit significant associations with clinical outcomes in TNBC, functioning as highly informative prognostic biomarkers that reliably predict metastatic progression and disease severity. For instance, eEF2K overexpression associates with reduced overall survival, increased lymph node/distant metastasis, and larger tumor size [ 59 134 52 107 58 5.3. Predictive Value of ARPs for Therapy in TNBC Multi-gene signatures incorporating ARPs have become indispensable for predicting treatment response and survival outcomes in TNBC, enabling personalized, risk-stratified therapeutic approaches. Among these, two clinically relevant signatures demonstrate particular prognostic value. An eight-gene autophagy signature, including ATF4, TGFBR1, SMAD4, and PIK3CA, correlates significantly with relapse-free survival (RFS), serving as a tool for prognosis and risk stratification [ 107 112 Although the potential of ARPs as biomarkers for TNBC is increasingly recognized, the specificity of individual markers is limited. There is an urgent need to develop multi-marker combined models based on large-scale, multi-center data. 6. Therapeutic Strategies Targeting ARPs in TNBC ARPs play pivotal roles in TNBC progression and therapeutic resistance, establishing them as attractive but challenging therapeutic targets. Unlike global autophagy modulation, effective therapeutic approaches require precise regulation of autophagic flux or selective interference with the tumor-promoting functions of specific ARPs. Strategies must be carefully tailored to both the tumor microenvironment and treatment regimen. Although preclinical investigations have revealed several promising agents targeting distinct phases of autophagy, critical obstacles, particularly the context-dependent dichotomous roles of ARPs and the marked heterogeneity inherent to TNBC, remain to be addressed before successful clinical implementation can be achieved. At the autophagy initiation stage, the serine/threonine kinase ULK1 serves as the master regulatory switch governing autophagosome formation. Emerging preclinical evidence highlights several promising ULK1-targeting therapeutic strategies. The small-molecule inhibitor SBI-0206965 selectively inhibits ULK1 and synergizes with mTOR inhibitors to promote ULK1 degradation and enhance tumor cell apoptosis, outperforming chloroquine (CQ) in efficacy [ 135 136 137 More recently, SBP-7455, a dual ULK1/2 inhibitor with higher target affinity than SBI-0206965, has been shown to block starvation-induced autophagy in TNBC and synergize with PARP inhibitors like olaparib [ 138 139 140 141 The Beclin-1-VPS34 complex serves as a key therapeutic target during autophagosome nucleation. SAR405, a selective PIK3C3/VPS34 inhibitor, disrupts lysosomal function and suppresses starvation-induced autophagy. Notably, its combination with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus demonstrates synergistic antiproliferative effects in renal carcinoma cells [ 142 68 Spautin-1 represents another promising intervention strategy through its inhibition of USP10/13, leading to VPS34 complex degradation and autophagy suppression. Recent findings reveal an additional mechanism whereby Spautin-1 promotes TOMM complex-mediated PINK1-PRKN-dependent mitophagy [ 143 144 34 145 146 At the degradation stage, CQ and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) represent the most clinically advanced autophagy modulators. These lysosomotropic agents function by alkalizing lysosomal pH and inhibiting hydrolytic enzymes, effectively blocking autophagosome–lysosome fusion and subsequent cargo degradation [ 75 147 148 93 149 150 151 152 150 153 154 155 7. Future Perspectives The formidable clinical challenges presented by TNBC underscore the critical need for novel therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence positions ARPs as a promising new frontier in TNBC treatment, offering multifaceted opportunities for intervention. This comprehensive review elucidates the pivotal roles of these proteins in driving TNBC pathogenesis and modulating treatment responses, establishing them as master regulators of disease progression, key determinants of therapeutic resistance, and attractive targets for clinical translation. These proteins collectively drive tumor malignancy across multiple levels. At the cellular level, they influence tumor growth by regulating the cell cycle and apoptotic balance. At the tissue level, they promote disease dissemination through modulating migration capacity and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. At the microenvironmental level, they reshape immune states and thereby affect interactions between the tumor and the host. This multifaceted regulation establishes autophagy-related proteins as pivotal nodes within the complex TNBC network. In treatment contexts, ARPs exhibit dual roles. On one hand, they may enhance cell survival and contribute to therapy resistance. On the other hand, targeted interventions, such as lysosome-directed chloroquine drugs, can effectively reverse resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, their potential as biomarkers offers new avenues for precision diagnosis and treatment of TNBC. Although existing studies have elucidated some functions and mechanisms of autophagy-related proteins, the precise regulatory networks across different molecular subtypes, disease stages, and treatment settings remain incompletely understood, and their clinical utility requires further validation. Future research must deepen understanding of the dual roles of autophagy, alongside innovative approaches to overcome current challenges in drug development and biomarker validation. With continued advances in basic and translational research, precise stratification and individualized intervention for TNBC are expected to gradually become achievable, providing new breakthroughs for this difficult-to-treat breast cancer.

Bafilomycin A1 increases the sensitivity of tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells to cisplatin by inhibiting the lysosomal uptake of platinum ions but not autophagy Cancer Lett. 2018 423 105 112 10.1016/j.canlet.2018.03.003 29524554 Figure 1 Molecular regulatory network of autophagy cascade. Autophagy is triggered by diverse stress signals via a tightly regulated molecular cascade. The process initiates with the activation of the class III PI3K complex and the recruitment of autophagy-related proteins (ARPs), which coordinately drive phagophore nucleation and membrane expansion. During autophagosome maturation, selective incorporation of membrane components and cargo receptors occurs through highly specific molecular sorting mechanisms. Ultimately, mature autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where sequestered cargo is degraded and metabolic byproducts are recycled to sustain cellular homeostasis. This image was created with BioRender.com Figure 2 Roles of ARPs in TNBC progression. In TNBC, ARPs drive tumor progression by regulating proliferation and apoptosis, enhancing invasion and metastasis (via EMT), remodeling the immune microenvironment (affecting immune cells and cytokines), and sustaining cancer stem cell stemness. This image was created with BioRender.com Figure 3 The Role of ARPs in TNBC Invasion and Metastasis. ARPs play critical roles in modulating tumor invasion and metastasis in TNBC. Red boxes with upward arrows denote factors or pathways that promote TNBC metastasis, whereas green boxes with downward arrows represent those that suppress it. This image was created with BioRender.com Figure 4 The role of ARPs in therapeutic responsiveness in TNBC. ARPs critically regulate TNBC treatment responses to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Distinct ARPs mediate each of these therapeutic response pathways. They exert both autophagy-dependent and -independent effects (particularly in radiotherapy). Proteins highlighted in red indicate promotion of therapy resistance, whereas proteins highlighted in green indicate inhibition of resistance or enhancement of therapy sensitivity.
