Most CRC cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, highlighting the need for effective early detection methods. In this regard, easily accessible biomarkers can help clinicians achieve this goal. Multiple factors, such as diet, environment, age, and genetics, are associated with CRC development. Emerging evidence indicates a potential role of viral infections, although these associations are incompletely understood. We found that human herpes, polyoma, and papilloma (HPV) viruses are common in the oral cavity of healthy individuals, and their prevalence increases in CRC patients, as well as in high-risk populations, such as individuals with obesity or colon adenomatous polyposis. Furthermore, surgery-induced weight loss in subjects with obesity is associated with a reduction in some beta-HPV types, arguing for their role as potential lifestyle-related early indicators of cancer risk.

Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health threat, being the third most common cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide, with incidence rates under the age of 50 expected to increase in the coming years [ 1 2 The increasing incidence of CRC reflects the overweight and obesity epidemics and the adoption of Western lifestyles [ 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Viral infections also represent risk factors for several cancers, contributing to approximately 15% of all cancer cases worldwide [ 1 14 14 15 16 15 16 17 18 Among HPV types, α and β have garnered significant attention due to their association with human health. While the role of high-risk mucosal α-HPV types is well established in anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers, cutaneous β-HPV genotypes are suspected to contribute to the development of non-melanoma skin cancers, in synergy with other risk factors. This group of viruses was shown to act as cofactors or facilitators of cancer development at the early stages of skin carcinogenesis, suggesting a hit-and-run mechanism [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Over the past decade, scientific interest has increased regarding the prevalence and distribution of β-HPV in non-cutaneous anatomical sites [ 28 29 30 31 32 Oral β-HPV prevalence in the healthy population can reach up to 60%, whereas higher viral prevalence and multiple infections have been reported in cohorts of immunocompromised or highly exposed individuals, correlating with impaired immune functions [ 28 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 34 Due to their wide distribution across different anatomical sites and their acquisition early in life, cutaneous HPV types can be considered part of the commensal flora or microbiota [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 In this pilot study, we employed highly sensitive and specific Luminex-based screening assays to investigate the prevalence of HHV, HPyV, and HPV infections in the oral cavity of CRC patients and high-risk subject groups, including individuals with OW, obesity, or AP. We report for the first time an increased prevalence of HPyV infections in subjects with AP, as well as increased β-HPV prevalence and multiple infections in CRC patients and high-risk individuals compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, specific β-HPV genotypes were overrepresented among CRC patients, individuals with obesity or AP, as well as in OW compared to normal-weight (NW) controls. Notably, surgery-induced weight loss in the obese cohort was associated with a reduction in the prevalence of these viral genotypes, suggesting their potential role as lifestyle-associated, and thus modifiable, early indicators of cancer risk. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Populations Four different subject cohorts were recruited in this study. A total of 50 individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC, male/female 27/23; mean age 70.6 ± 8.98 years; mean BMI 25.55 ± 3.6 kg/m 2 2 A total of 35 subjects affected by severe obesity (32 females; mean age 52.6 ± 10.84 years; mean BMI 44.75 ± 6.49 kg/m 2 2 49 50 A total of 46 healthy individuals (male/female 25/21; mean age 51.7 ± 12.44 years; mean BMI 24.68 ± 2.7 kg/m 2 The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethical Committees of Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS-15/03/16-n.173/16 and AOO-ISS-24/05/19-0016145). All participants in the study signed informed consent forms and filled out a questionnaire that collected information about their family and medical history, current medication use, smoking, dietary, and physical activity habits. Sample collection and processing were performed by assigning a specific code to each subject to maintain anonymity, in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. 2.2. Sample Collection Oral rinse and gargle samples were collected at enrolment from all subject cohorts. For subjects with obesity, samples were also collected at 6 and 12 months after BS. Participants rinsed and gargled with 15 mL of sterile saline solution (0.9% NaCl) for 30 s. Samples were then transferred into sterile tubes containing PreservCyt Solution (Hologic. Inc., Malborough, MA, USA), and centrifuged at 3000× g 2.3. DNA Extraction from Oral Rinse and Gargle Samples Samples were homogenized twice for 30 s at 6000 rpm using MagNA Lyser Green Beads (Roche, Monza, Italy), and DNA was isolated using the Qiagen BioRobot EZ1 Advanced XL with the EZ1 Advanced DSP Virus Card, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). The concentration of DNA was determined using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). 2.4. Viral DNA Detection Assay Type-specific multiplex genotyping (TS-MPG) assays, based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bead-based Luminex technology (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX, USA), were used to analyze the presence of DNA from human papillomavirus (HPV), polyomavirus (HPyV), and herpesvirus (HHV) genotypes. Using 10 µL of each DNA extract, multiplex PCRs were performed using specific primers targeting 21 α-HPV (HPV6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 70, 73, and 82), 45 β-HPV types (HPV5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 47, 49, 75, 76, 80, 92, 93, 96, 98, 99, 100, 104, 105, 107, 110, 111, 113, 115, 118, 120, 122, 124, 143, 145, 150, 151, 152, and 159), 52 γ-HPV types (HPV4, 48, 50, 60, 65, 88, 95, 101, 103, 108, 109, 112, 116, 119, 121, 123, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 148, 149, 156, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 175, 178, 179, 180, 184, 197, 199, 200, 201, 202, and SD2 (PMID: 23554892)), 13 HPyV types (BKPyV, WUPyV, KIPyV, MCPyV, JCPyV, HPyV6, HpyV7, HPyV9, HPyV10, TSPyV, HPyV12, LIPyV, and SV40), and 10 HHV [HSV1, HSV2, HHV3 (HZV) EBV1, EBV2, CMV, HHV6A, HHV6B, HHV7, and HHV8 (KSHV)]. In addition, two primers for human beta-globin were used to assess the quality of the DNA extract. After PCR amplification, 10 μL of each reaction was analyzed by multiplex genotyping using a Luminex-based assay, as previously described [ 51 52 53 51 Supplementary Data S1–S5 2.5. Quantification of Plasma Mediators Plasma TNF-α, IL6, and leptin levels were evaluated using a Human High-Sensitivity Magnetic Luminex Performance Assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Bio-Plex Manager software (version 6.1, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Segrate, MI, Italy) was used for data analysis. Plasma levels of adiponectin were determined by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Droplet digital PCR (Bio-Rad QX 200, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Segrate, MI, Italy) was performed to evaluate the levels of circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) fragments in plasma samples. The analysis was carried out using 0.5 µL of plasma. MT-ND2 and RPLP0 TaqMan probes were used to detect mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, respectively (cat. no. 4331182; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 2.6. Statistical Analysis The HPV, HPyV, and HHV prevalence is expressed as the percentage of all subjects tested and represents the prevalence in both single and multiple infections. Samples with multiple infections are those with two or more viral types detected and were counted as positive for each type. The prevalence (n/N%) of any given virus genotype infection was calculated as the percentage of individuals who tested positive (n) for the genotype of interest out of the total number of individuals tested in each group (N). All statistical tests were conducted employing R (v.4.2.0). The differences in prevalence between groups were tested with Fisher’s exact test, considering as significant only differences with a p t t 3. Results 3.1. Comparative Analysis of Oral DNA Virus Profiles in Colorectal Cancer Patients and At-Risk Populations with Obesity or Nonfamilial Adenomatous Polyposis The presence and distribution of selected oral human DNA viruses were investigated in patients with CRC (cancer group) and individuals with obesity or nonfamilial AP, both considered at-risk groups, in comparison to a healthy control group. Oral rinse and gargle samples were analyzed using a bead-based Luminex assay to detect viral DNA from HPV, HPyV, and HHV. In total, 153 samples were collected from 35 individuals with obesity, 22 with AP, 50 CRC patients, and 46 healthy controls. The anthropometric and clinical characteristics of the study groups are reported in Table 1 The analysis of virus families revealed a significantly higher prevalence of HPV infections, regardless of the genus, among CRC patients, and a trend toward increased prevalence in subjects with obesity, compared to controls ( Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 1 The analysis of HPyV family members allowed us to identify only two genotypes, HPyV6 and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). As shown in Table 2 For HHV, the most frequently detected genotypes across all groups were EBV1, whose prevalence was significantly higher in CRC patients compared to controls, HHV-6B, and HHV7 ( Table 2 3.2. The β-HPV Genus Is the Most Frequently Detected and Differentially Distributed Among Subject Groups Within HPV, the β genus was the most frequently detected in the oral cavity across all subject groups ( Figure 2 Table 2 Figure 2 Table 2 Figure 2 Table 2 Concerning β-HPV infections, the percentages of individuals with single-genotype infections in the control, obesity, AP, and CRC groups were 10.7%, 34.6%, 0%, and 15.6%, respectively. However, most subjects harbored at least two β-HPV genotypes (54%, 51%, 73%, and 74%, respectively). Based on the number of genotypes detected, subjects were categorized into subgroups with ≥2, ≥5, and ≥10 β-HPV infections. As for the above-reported HPV/HPyV/HHV co-infections, this analysis also revealed a higher proportion of multiple β-HPV infections in patients with colorectal neoplasia (≥2: 74 vs. 54%, p p p p p p Figure 2 3.3. Impact of Tumor Stage and Precancerous Lesion Features on Oral Virus Prevalence CRC patients at different tumor stages were included in the study ( Table 1 Supplementary Figure S1A,B Table 1 Supplementary Figure S1C,D p p 3.4. Distribution and Prevalence of Individual β-HPV Genotypes in Risk and Cancer Groups Compared to Controls Of the 45 β-HPV genotypes tested, 42 were detected across all study groups. Specifically, 34 genotypes were found in control individuals, 33 in both obesity and AP groups, and 40 in CRC patients. The distribution and prevalence of specific β-HPV species and individual genotypes in cancer and risk groups, and the comparisons with the control group, are reported in Figure 3 Supplementary Table S1 Figure 3 Supplementary Table S1 34 Figure 3 Supplementary Table S1 A significantly higher prevalence of both β1 and β2 species was observed among CRC patients compared to controls (β1: 80% vs. 48%, p p p p Figure 3 Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Table S1 3.5. Overrepresented β-HPV Genotypes in Cancer and Risk Groups Versus Control Group: Unique and Shared Profiles The increased prevalence of several β-HPV genotypes in the CRC and risk groups compared to controls suggests a potential role for these viruses as risk indicators. A Venn diagram was used to assess the number of overrepresented (showing at least a 1.5-fold increase in prevalence) viral genotypes in the cancer and risk groups versus controls, as well as their overlapping or uniqueness. As shown in Figure 4 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 4 Supplementary Table S2 Focusing on the genotypes overrepresented in the CRC group or shared with one or both risk groups ( Figure 4 18 3.6. Prevalence of Cancer-Relevant β-HPV Genotypes Is Increased in Risk and Cancer Groups, and in Healthy Controls According to BMI Increased BMI is linked with chronic inflammation and higher susceptibility to infection. Moreover, OW individuals are at increased risk of CRC as compared to their NW counterparts [ 54 Figure 5 Table 3 Most genotypes showed a higher prevalence in OW compared to the age-matched NW controls. Notably, the prevalence of HPV5 was significantly increased in all groups relative to the healthy NW controls ( Figure 5 Table 3 Figure 5 Table 3 Figure 5 Figure 5 3.7. Bariatric Surgery Shapes Oral Viral Profiles in Individuals with Obesity and Reduces the Prevalence of Cancer-Relevant β-HPV Infections Several epidemiological studies have reported a significant decrease in CRC risk in subjects with obesity undergoing BS [ 55 A reduction in HPV and HPyV prevalence was observed at both T6 and T12 compared to the baseline ( Figure 6 Table 4 For β-HPV, a progressive reduction in overall prevalence was found post-surgery, with only a modest decrease in the frequency of multiple infections observed at T12 ( Figure 6 Table 4 Supplementary Figure S2 We next examined whether the frequencies of the specific β-HPV genotypes were modulated by BS. This analysis revealed that, among 33 genotypes detected in the oral cavity of individuals with obesity at the baseline, 15 exhibited reduced prevalence at T6 and/or T12. Interestingly, this group included 11 β-HPV types we found to be associated with CRC risk ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Table 5 Four additional β-HPV types (HPV19, HPV92, HPV105, HPV113) showed reduced prevalence post-surgery ( Table 5 Confounding variables (smoking, age, and BMI) were tested to inspect their role in prevalence changes of these β-HPV genotypes across subject groups. Only age was found to be a confounding factor for two of the selected genotypes, HPV8 (standardized mean difference, SMD 0.72) and HPV120 (SMD 0.94), thus weakening their association with CRC risk. 3.8. Sex Differences in Oral β-HPV Genotype Profiles Sex-based disparities in CRC incidence have been documented, with men generally at higher risk than women [ 56 Table 1 Figure 8 p p Figure 8 Supplementary Table S3 Figure 8 Supplementary Table S3 p p Figure 8 4. Discussion In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of human DNA viruses in the oral cavity of CRC patients and subjects with cancer-predisposing conditions, assessing their role as potential risk indicators. While several previous studies reported the presence of viral DNA in CRC tissues [ 15 16 18 The prevalence of oral β-HPV infections in healthy populations varies widely across studies but rarely exceeds 60% even in older cohorts [ 30 33 34 35 36 39 40 57 34 35 36 39 40 30 33 58 59 Importantly, in support of our hypothesis, BS-associated weight loss was accompanied by observed decreases in most of these relevant viral genotypes in varying proportions. Among the six β-HPV types identified as “common” to CRC and all risk groups, four (HPV5, HPV96, HPV100, and HPV159) showed clearance in a proportion of subjects 12 months after BS. Notably, HPV5 was classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 2B carcinogen, PMID: 206906) and has been associated with oral and oropharyngeal cancers [ 40 Additional potentially oncogenic β-HPV genotypes were also reduced after BS. Furthermore, BS was associated with observed clearance of infections by some β-HPV types (HPV23, HPV49, HPV120, and HPV124) previously identified in tumor tissue-adjacent colon mucosa of CRC patients [ 18 In this study, multiple oral β-HPV infections were also observed in control subjects, as reported in previous studies, and a marked increase in their frequency was reported in CRC patients and in subjects with high-risk colon polyps. Notably, the role of multiple HPV type co-infections in HPV-related cancers has been analyzed, showing an association with an increased risk of malignant transformation [ 60 61 Few studies have investigated the immune, hormonal, and lifestyle factors potentially influencing virus persistence in the oral cavity [ 34 37 62 48 63 64 65 50 66 67 Persistent viral infections may also be maintained by virus–bacteria interactions within the oral microbiome. In this regard, an increased Streptococcus sanguinis 68 69 70 71 72 73 18 Sex differences have been described in CRC incidence, with men being at a higher risk of developing cancer compared to women [ 56 59 62 30 33 38 39 74 The increased prevalence of specific oral β-HPV types we reported in CRC patients and high-risk subject groups takes on further relevance as some of these viral genotypes have been shown to have transforming properties in in vitro and in vivo experimental models [ 75 76 36 40 77 78 5. Conclusions CRC is a major global health issue, with increasing incidence rates in individuals younger than 50. Anticipating the detection of early, curable disease stages has the potential to reduce the health burden. Furthermore, the early detection of modifiable risk factors is critical. In this pilot study, we identified a panel of oral β-HPV genotypes that may serve as potential early non-invasive indicators of CRC risk. The sex differences in their frequencies and their modifiable nature could allow the identification of high-risk individuals who would benefit from lifestyle interventions and could help guide prevention towards sex-oriented strategies. Future prospective studies with larger and sex-stratified cohorts are required to validate the risk-predictive value of these viral types and to assess their utility in clinical practice and public health interventions.
