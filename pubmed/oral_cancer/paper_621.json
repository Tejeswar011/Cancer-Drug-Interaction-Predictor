Osteoradionecrosis of the jaw (ORNJ) is a complication of radiation therapy that can lead to hard-to-repair bone defects. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been identified as potential “seeds” for restoring bone defects. In this study, we reported extracellular matrix protein cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) to enhance the migratory and osteogenic functions of irradiated BMSCs (IR BMSCs) by migrasomes. Various assays, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), apoptosis analysis, qRT-PCR, western blot, ALP staining, alizarin red S (ARS) staining, wound healing assay, transwell assay, and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) were conducted to assess the optimal radiation dose for generating IR BMSCs and migrasome functionality. Proteomics, bioinformatics analysis, gene transfection, and molecular docking were employed to identify key molecules mediating migration and osteoblastic differentiation and its downstream mechanisms. Furthermore, confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot were utilized to identify migrasomes. Results showed that a radiation dose of 2 Gy inhibited migratory and osteogenic abilities of cells without significantly affecting viability. CYR61 emerged as a pivotal molecule regulating BMSC migration and osteoblastic differentiation through binding to integrin αvβ3 at the 125th aspartic acid and activating the ERK signaling pathway. We discovered that migrasomes are the key vehicle effectively delivering CYR61 to restore migration and osteogenesis of IR BMSCs. In conclusion, migrasomes-secreted CYR61 facilitating a promotional effect can regulate the migration and osteogenesis of IR BMSCs. Thus, migrasomes-origin CYR61 may serve as potential therapeutic agents for repairing ORNJ-related bone defects.

Introduction Osteoradionecrosis of the jaws (ORNJs) is a complication arising from radiation therapy for head and neck malignancies, often resulting in severe bone defect [ 1 2 3 Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are vital for bone regeneration following radiative injuries and are a primary cell type involved in ORNJ [ 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 6 10 To our knowledge, there are few reports on migrative inhibition, for instance, a 6 Gy dose has been shown to inhibit the migration of IR BMSCs derived from mice [ 5 11 In this study, we have explored that cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) or cellular communication network factor family member 1 (CCN1) is decreased in IR BMSCs by proteomics study. We also investigated that the deficiency of CYR61 result in inhibiting the migration and osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs and the downstream molecular mechanisms. Our findings revealed that CYR61 in migrasomes derived from BMSCs are promising for treating ORNJ-related bone defects. CYR61, an extracellular matrix protein vital for migration is known to activate the migration-associated protein RhoA [ 12 13 14 15 Migration is a multifaceted process initiated by adhesion, where cells move towards an injury site [ 11 16 17 18 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Although extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been linked to ORNJ, their therapeutic effects on ORNJ have not been clearly reported [ 26 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture, Characteristics, and Reagents This study involving human specimens was approved by the Ethics Committee Department of The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang City (Approval number: KY-20240407001-01). All study procedures, including notifications and obtaining consent, were conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines. BMSCs were isolated from the jaw bone tissue of patients between 18 and 35 years old who underwent extraction of impacted teeth. The inclusion criteria and cell isolation protocols were conducted as previously described, with BMSCs being used for the following experiments before Passage 15 [ 27 28 28 To test osteogenic differentiation, BMSCs were cultured in osteogenic induction medium (OIM), containing 10 −7 To investigate the requirement of ERK in CYR61 function, 10 μM CYR61 (HY-P7842, MCE, USA) in serum-free medium for 24 h and 10 μM specific ERK inhibitor U0126 (HY-12031A, MCE, USA) for 1 h were employed [ 29 2.2. Generation of IR-Induced BMSCs The cells were cultured in T25 flasks, and when they reached a confluency of 90%, they were exposed to a single dose of X-ray irradiation from the linear accelerator, as previously described [ 30 31 2.3. Assays for Detecting the Cell Condition The cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay following the manufacturer's instructions provided with the CCK-8 kit (C6005, NCM Biotech, China). Specifically, cells were seeded into a 96-well plate. Upon adherence to the plate, they were serum-starved for 24 h prior to the addition of 100 µL of basal medium containing 10 µL of CCK-8. Apoptosis analysis was conducted using flow cytometry after staining the cells with the Annexin V/FITC-propidium iodide (PI) from the Apoptosis Detection kit (KGA105, Kaiji, China). The data were analyzed using FlowJo_V10 software. 2.4. Analysis of Cell Mobility Would healing assay and transwell assay were conducted in this part to detect changes in cell mobility. For the wound healing assay, cells were plated on a six-well plate and allowed to reach confluence of over 90%. A 200 µL pipette tip was then used to create a scratch wound. After 24 h of incubation in serum-free medium, photos of the wound area were collected again to assess cell migration. For the transwell assay, we prepared 8-µm transwell inserts and placed them in a 12-well plate. Then, 1 × 10 4 2.5. qRT-PCR Assay Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (CWBIO, China). Subsequently, cDNA was synthesized following the instructions provided with the HiScript II RT SuperMix for qPCR kit (R223, Vazyme, China). The primers utilized in this study are listed in Table 1 2.6. Western Blot Analysis This assay aimed to assess the expression levels of proteins, including key molecules associated with osteogenesis, migrasome biomarkers, and ERK signaling. The samples were prepared with RIPA (P0013B, Beyotime, China) adding protease inhibitor cocktail (K1007, APExBIO, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (K1015, APExBIO, USA). The antibodies used were as follows: runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2; AF5186, Affinity, USA), osterix (OSX; DF7731, Affinity, USA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP; DF6225, Affinity, USA), EOGT (HA721973, HuaBio, China), integrin αvβ3 (ER1911-52, HuaBio, China), ERK1/2 (ET1601-29, HuaBio, China), phospho-ERK1(T202 + Y204) + ERK2(T185 + Y187) (SC58-1, HuaBio, China), TSPAN4 (A10253, ABclonal, China), CYR61 (26689-1-AP, Proteintech, China), β-actin (66009-1, Proteintech, China), HRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (HA1001, Huabio, China), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (No. HRP-10283, Proteintech, China). β-actin served as an internal reference for normalization. 2.7. ALP Activity Assay The assay was designed to evaluate the osteoblastic differentiation potential of the cells. After culturing in OIM for 7 days, the cells were gently harvested and ALP activity was assessed using the kit (A059-2, Jiancheng, China) and a microplate reader (iMark, Biorad, USA), measuring absorbance values (OD). These results were normalized by protein concentration, determined using the Bradford kit (P0006C, Beyotime, China). 2.8. ALP Staining Assay This experiment aimed to detect ALP activity more vividly. After induction with OIM for 7 days, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained according to the instructions provided with the BCIP/NBT Alkaline Phosphatase Color Development Kit (C3206, Beyotime, China). The photos were then captured using microscopy and a scanner. 2.9. Alizarin Red S (ARS) Staining Assay This assay was designed to demonstrate mineral nodule formation and reflect osteogenic potential. After culturing in OIM for 14 days, fixed cells were stained with ARS staining reagent (C0138, Beyotime, China) for 5 min, and images were captured. 2.10. Isolation and Identification of Migrasomes First, we employed iFluor 488-wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-488; 25530, AAT Bioquest, USA) staining and confocal microscopy to observe migrasomes derived from BMSCs during the migration process. When the cell confluence reached 30%–40%, BMSCs were subjected to serum deprivation for 24 h. Subsequently, both the supernatant and cells were collected and migrasomes were isolated using the previously reported method, which we summarize as differential centrifugation–reverse filtration–ultrafiltration (DC–RF–UF) [ 32 g g g 32 2.11. Proteomics Study BMSCs and IR BMSCs, each with three biological replicates, underwent cleavage for proteomic analysis, which was conducted by HOOGEN BIOTECH (Shanghai, China). Following reduction, alkylation, and trypsin hydrolysis, peptides were labeled with tandem-mass-tag (TMT) and subjected to quantitative mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was employed for data collection. Protein identification and quantitative analysis were conducted, followed by differential expression analysis and bioinformatics analysis. Pathway analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) databases. 2.12. Immunofluorescence Staining Cells were seeded on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde once they reached 30%–40% confluence. They were then permeabilised with 0.5% Triton X-100 and blocked using goat serum. The coverslips were incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody, followed by incubation with either a CY3-conjugated secondary antibody (33108ES60, Yeasen, China) or a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (33107ES60, Yeasen, China) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the coverslips were stained with WGA-488 or DAPI solution (BL105A, Biosharp, China). Confocal microscopy was used to examine the localization of CYR61 within migrasomes and its association with integrin αvβ3. 2.13. Gene Transfection Three small interference RNAs (siRNAs) targeting CYR61 were supplied by Genebase (Nanjing, China) to downregulate CYR61 expression. These siRNAs, along with a corresponding control, were transfected into BMSCs using Lipo 8000 (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The effectiveness of the transfection was evaluated using qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. Additionally, we also constructed the lentivirus named shCYR61 based on the siRNA with the highest efficiency and pLVX-puro vector from Corues Biotechnology (NanJing, China). 2.14. Molecular Docking To explore the interactions between CYR61 and integrin αvβ3, we performed molecular docking to analyze their potential binding modes. The crystal structures of the proteins were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The construction of these structures and the molecular docking processes were predicted using the GRAMM docking web server. These docking results were ranked based on their potential docking probabilities and the top three were further analyzed using PDBePISA. The key binding site in CYR61 was represented by PyMol 3.0. 2.15. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) This assay evaluated the binding of CYR61 and its downstream integrin αvβ3. 10 8 P70100 2.16. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 software. Student's t p 3. Results 3.1. Isolation and Characterization of BMSCs Primary BMSCs were derived from jaw bone tissue ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. The Migratory and Osteogenic Differentiation Capabilities of IR BMSCs Were Inhibited The ALP activity assay showed that radiation affected osteogenic differentiation with 2 Gy, which initially demonstrated a less pronounced effect ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 ALP OSX RUNX2 Figure 2 1 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 3.3. ECM Protein CYR61 Was Decreased in IR BMSCs Comparing to BMSCs To identify the key molecule involved in reducing the mobility and osteogenic properties mediated by irradiation, we carried out a proteomics analysis that led to the identification of 560 proteins (347 upregulated and 213 downregulated) that met our inclusion criteria ( p Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 33 34 33 3.4. CYR61 Promoted Migration and Osteogenesis by Binding Integrin αvβ3 via ERK Signaling To investigate the role of CYR61 in migration and osteogenesis, we constructed three siRNAs ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 S1 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 S1 Figure 4 4 3.5. CYR61 Was in the Migration-Related Vesicles, Known as Migrasomes by BMSCs We observed migrasomes (indicated by yellow arrows) and their associated RFs, which emitted green fluorescence under WGA-488 staining ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 3.6. Migrasomes-Derived From BMSCs Could Supplement With CYR61 and Rescue the Migrative and Osteoblastic Ability of IR BMSCs To identify the optimal concentration for inducing IR BMSCs, the ALP activity assay was repeated and the optimal concentration was found to be 2 µg/mL ( Figure 6 Figure 6 6 ALP OSX RUNX2 Figure 6 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 4. Discussion This study addresses the challenges associated with ORNJ-related bone defects, which are often complicated by radiation effects on BMSCs [ 1 35 5 10 7 5 17 36 In osteocytes, fluid shear stress induces CYR61, which potentially mediate mechanotransduction, thereby promoting osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Moreover, CCN family members' expression significantly alters the cellular micro environment. These proteins exert their diverse regulatory functions—including effects on migration and differentiation—primarily by binding various integrin receptors on cell surfaces [ 37 38 29 CYR61 also inhibits osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway [ 39 40 Contrasting with its tumor-promoting role in melanoma, CYR61 drives cell migration and tumor progression [ 41 42 43 33 Moreover, CYR61's interaction with integrin αvβ3 at the 125th aspartic acid is pivotal in human [ 44 45 Furthermore, among the top differentially expressed proteins in our proteomics study, Cathepsin K, involved in osteoclastic resorption and bone remodeling disorders, was identified as the 20th most upregulated protein and IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 3 (IQGAP3; ranked 1 st 46 47 The regenerative properties of MSCs and their organelles, specifically migrasomes, are promising for healing ORNJ-related defects due to their bone regeneration capabilities [ 31 48 22 19 49 32 25 50 51 Overall, our study requires further validation to confirm the function of CYR61 in vivo and to establish the critical role of migrasomes-origin CYR61 in bone regeneration under ORNJ conditions. It is essential to develop convenient and widely-used methods for the isolation of migrasomes that meet clinical needs in terms of yield, purity, and reproducibility. Additionally, considering the complex intercellular communication and micro environment, migrasomes-based approaches are still challenging [ 52 5. Conclusions IR BMSCs' depressed migratory and osteogenic functions are potential etiologic factors for ORNJ and associated bone defects. Deficiency of CYR61 plays a pivotal role in these abnormal functions caused by radiotherapy and can be transferred by migrasomes. Our study highlights the potential application of migrasomes-origin CYR61 in future clinical settings for applications of BMSCs in cell therapy and regenerative medicine pointing to ORNJ-related bone defects.
