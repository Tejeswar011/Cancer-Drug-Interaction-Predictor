Spectrofluorimetry has received a lot of interest lately because of its ecological greenness and analytical performance. This approach employed the native fluorescence of chrysin at 339 nm following excitation at 231 nm in distilled water. Modern advances in analytical chemistry have been used to lessen occupational and environmental concerns by employing distilled water as a dilution solvent through method development and application. The approach was found to be excellent green supported by eco-scale score of 97 and 0.94 AGREE rating, in addition to an overall whiteness score of 88.80. The design aimed to analyze chrysin in raw materials, Chrysin® capsules and human plasma.

The utilization of flavonoid complexes as fluorescent probes is extensive in the detection of cations and biological proteins [ 8 9 11 12 13 15 In recent years, several analytical techniques have been employed for the determination of CRS, including UV–Vis spectrophotometry [ 16 17 19 20 21 16 17 19 20 21 Since none of the reported approaches employed CRS's natural fluorescence properties. This study sought to develop a new quick, selective, and sensitive spectrofluorimetric method for assessing CRS in biological samples and pharmaceuticals. Recent green chemistry developments are guided by 12 principles and aim to achieve both environmental and economic goals [ 22 23 24 25 26 Experimental Instruments At voltage of 800 mV, Agilent® Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer with a flash xenon lamp was operated for measurements. A smoothing factor of 20 and slit width of 5 nm were applied. High Performance Quartz Glass Hellma®, pathlength 10x10 mm, spectral range 200-2,500 nm, were used for measurements. pH-Meter (Consort, P-901) was utilized to adjust buffer solutions pHs. Vortex Mixer (IVM-300P, Taiwan) and Centrifuge (model 2-16P, SIGMA Laborzentrifugen, Germany) was used for separation of biological matrices. Wisd Wise Clean WUC A22H Ultrasonic Bath (Witeg, Germany) was used for samples sonication. Reagents and Materials Researchers purchased analytical grade CRS with CAS number c80105-25G of 97 % purity and methanol (Fischer®) from Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany. Chrysin® capsules CA 92056 USA, manufactured for MRM®, containing 500 mg CRS per capsule, were used for method application. From Sigma-Aldrich, Cairo, Egypt, analytical grades of cetrimide, beta cyclodextrin (βCD), tween 80, sodium dodecyl sulphate, and HPLC grade acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, ethanol, n-propanol, and methanol, were all acquired. Hospitals of Mansoura University in Dakahlia, Egypt donated the frozen plasma of a healthy 26-year-old donor, which was kept at -5˚ C until it was required. Distilled water was obtained from faculty of pharmacy, Mansoura University. Standard Solutions After precisely weighing 10.0 mg of CRS raw material, it was quantitatively transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask to be dissolved in methanol. 100 µg. mL ⁻1 ⁻1 Procedures CRS Calibration Graph A set of 10.0 mL volumetric flasks was arranged, into which aliquots of CRS working standard were put so that the final diluted concentrations in Table 2 ⁻1 Applications Average Content Determination of CRS in Chrysin® Capsules Chrysin ® Chrysin ® -1 Determination of CRS in Spiked Human Plasma Samples Gentle thawing of the given frozen plasma was performed. A set of 15.0-mL centrifugation tubes were supplied with 1.0 mL aliquots of human plasma, which were then spiked with aliquots of CRS to reach the final studied concentrations in the range of 3.0–7.0 ng mL ⁻1 Results and Discussion Method Development Spectrofluorimetry as a technique can be utilized for identifying a wide range of chemicals in biological samples because of its high sensitivity (ng mL ⁻1 27 1 2 Fig. 2 Fluorescence spectra: excitation and emission spectra of ( A B ⁻1 Furthermore, water was used as a diluting solvent, reinforcing economically friendly chemical recommendations that have been widely implemented to reduce environmental and occupational concerns as compared to organic solvents. Factors affecting CRS’s RFI, such as pH, surfactant type, and diluting solvent, were thoroughly examined in order to obtain optimal sensitivity and linearity while maintaining maximum stability. Each element was carefully examined, while other factors were held constant using the univariate optimization technique. Different pH Values’ Effect on RFI of CRS The pH has a significant effect on the fluorescence spectrum, which can either increase or decrease RFI. This is primarily dependent on the analyte's chemical structure and if a specific pH boosts its resonance forms [ 28 As a result, multiple pH values ranging from 3.5 to 10.0 were tested using 0.1M Britton Robinson buffer. As indicated in Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Effect of different ( a b c ⁻1 Solvents’ Effect on RFI of CRS A hydrogen-bonding solvent can affect the value of λ max 28 3 Surfactants’ Effect on RFI of CRS Any systematic change that affects the number or strength of collisions in the solution may influence the magnitude of RFI. Collisions enhance radiation less decay and the loss of excess energy as heat, therefore more or more violent collisions contribute to radiation less decay and diminish fluorescence emission [ 28 3 Analytical Methodology Validation Linearity and Range The present method was validated in compliance with the FDA standards. [ 29 The CRS calibration curve was developed using eight distinct concentrations in the linearity range of 0.5 – 7.0 ng mL ⁻1 4 1 Fig. 4 Fluorescence emission spectra of increasing concentration of CRS ranging from (0.5-7.0 ng mL -1 Table 1 Analytical performance data for determination of CRS using the suggested spectrofluorimetric method Validation parameter Spectrofluorimetric method λ excitation/emision 231/339 Linearity range 0.5–7 ng mL -1 Intercept (a) 31.69 Slope (b) 103.66 Correlation coefficient (r) 0.9999 S.D. of residuals (S y/x 3.01 S.D. of intercept (S a 2.02 S.D. of slope (S b 0.48 Limit of detection, LOD 0.06 ng mL -1 Limit of quantitation, LOQ 0.20 ng mL -1 Detection and Quantitation Limits CRS had low limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) values of 0.06 and 0.20 ng mL ⁻1 1 a a a Accuracy and Precision To evaluate accuracy and precision, Our technique was compared to the comparative method [ 16 2 t 30 2 Table 2 Application of the suggested spectrofluorimetric method to the determination of CRS in its raw material Parameters Suggested spectrofluorimetric method Reference method 16 Aliquots volume (mL) Conc. taken −1 Conc. found (ng mL −1 %Found a % Found a 0.025 0.50 0.49 98.02 101.91 0.05 1.00 1.02 101.50 99.81 0.10 2.00 2.01 100.47 98.95 0.15 3.00 2.97 99.14 100.44 0.20 4.00 4.04 100.88 0.25 5.00 4.95 99.03 0.30 6.00 6.02 100.29 0.35 7.00 7.01 100.09 Mean ± S.D 99.94 ± 1.14 100.28 ± 1.25 Accuracy Mean recovery% ± Er% 99.94 ± 0.50 Student t test 0.49(2.23)* F- test 1.23 (4.35)* a * t F P 30 16 Table 3 Table 3 Precision data for the determination of CRS applying the suggested spectrofluorimetric method Concentration (ng mL −1 Intra-day precision Inter-day precision Mean ± SD RSD (%) %Error Mean ± SD RSD (%) %Error 1.0 101.09 ± 1.16 1.15 0.66 101.50 ± 1.20 1.19 0.68 3.0 99.14 ± 0.97 0.97 0.56 98.88 ± 1.07 1.07 0.62 6.0 100.31 ± 0.89 0.89 0.51 100.18 ± 1.22 1.22 0.70 Applications The average content of CRS was detected in the Chrysin ® t 4 Table 4 Application of the suggested spectrofluorimetric method to the determination of CRS in capsules Pharmaceutical dosage forms Proposed spectrofluorimetric Method Reference Method Conc. taken (ng mL -1 % Found a % Found a Chrysin® capsule (500 mg CRS) 1.00 98.33 98.79 3.00 101.22 102.14 4.00 100.49 98.4 6.00 99.00 100.62 Mean ± S.D. 99.76 ± 1.32 99.99 ± 1.73 % RSD 1.32 1.73  Student t test 0.21 (2.45)* F- test 1.70 (9.28)*  a *The values between parentheses are the tabulated values of t F P A metabolism study of CRS showed that plasma concentrations vary from 3.0 to 16.0 ng mL ⁻1 31 32 Table 5 5 ⁻1 Table 5 Application of the suggested method to the determination of CRS in spiked human plasma Drug Assay results CRS Amount taken -1 Amount found -1 Percent found 3.00 2.95 98.38 4.00 4.14 103.45 5.00 4.89 97.80 7.00 7.02 100.29 Mean ± S.D 99.98 ± 2.54 % RSD 2.54 % Error 1.27 Fig. 5 Application of the proposed spectrofluorimetric method for determination of CRS in spiked human plasma.

The final score is calculated using a specific piece of software in accordance with the 12 criteria [ 25 7 Fig. 7 The green assessment profile for the suggested spectrofluorimetric method, using AGREE tool ( A B Evaluation of Method Whiteness The RGB algorithm, a metric tool of white analytical chemistry (WAC), was utilized to analyze the whiteness of the proposed method. Three factors are considered by WAC: analytical validity, economic feasibility, and ecological safety. Hence, this metric system is beneficial for determining the sustainability of an analytical procedure. Different colors correspond to each attribute, where red stands for analytical performance (R), green for environmental green impact (G), that is related to the green analytical chemistry derived 12 principles (GAC), and blue (B) for economic efficiency, productivity and practical applicability [ 26 The whiteness of analytical methodology is represented by an end result ranging from white to black, based on the respective provisions of the three characteristics stated and the method's performance with regard to each aspect. The suggested strategy achieved 88.80% as an overall whiteness score (Table 8. Table 8. Whiteness assessment of the suggested spectrofluorimetric method for CRS applying RGB algorithm Conclusion The flavonoid chrysin was estimated utilizing the first, ultra-fast, direct, reliable, and simple, validated spectrofluorimetric method. Chrysin was determined successfully utilizing the proposed technique in chrysin capsules and spiked human plasma samples. The methodology offered a high level of sensitivity, was significantly less expensive compared to HPLC-MS approaches, and entailed faster, simpler operations. The proposed approach received 97 total penalty points on the analytical eco-scale, 0.94 AGREE score, and 88.80 total whiteness score demonstrating alignment with the 12 principles of green analysis. Moreover, a total whiteness score of 88.80% was attained, highlighting the method sustainability and well balance.
