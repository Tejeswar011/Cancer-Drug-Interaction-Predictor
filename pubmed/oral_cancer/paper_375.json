The concept of DDI extends beyond traditional ICI combinations to encompass various innovative pairings: ICIs with oncolytic viruses (OVs), adoptive cell therapies (CAR-T/TIL), cancer vaccines, or cytokine therapies. These combinations demonstrate unique synergistic mechanisms and enhanced therapeutic potential through multi-faceted immune activation. Significantly, this work advances the field by analyzing potential third-agent sensitizers to complement DDI strategies. We systematically evaluate emerging candidates including PCNA inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, focusing on their ability to modulate the tumor microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy responses. This \"DDI + 1\" approach targets alternative pathways to overcome resistance mechanisms and expand treatment efficacy to traditionally immunotherapy-resistant cancers. Through comprehensive analysis of preclinical evidence and ongoing clinical trials, we address critical challenges in immunotherapy, including primary and acquired resistance, cold tumor conversion, and pathway exhaustion. The review synthesizes current findings while proposing innovative solutions and future research directions. Our framework demonstrates how strategic integration of multiple immune-based approaches can significantly improve therapeutic outcomes across diverse cancer types, potentially revolutionizing cancer treatment paradigms. This concept of DDI, enhanced by rational third-agent selection, represents a promising direction for addressing urgent clinical needs in oncology. By establishing a theoretical foundation for this approach, we aim to guide future research and clinical applications in cancer immunotherapy.

Primary resistance affects 60–70% of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly those with \"cold\" tumors characterized by low immune cell infiltration and limited neoantigen burden [ 17 18 19 A critical knowledge gap exists in the systematic integration of distinct immunotherapeutic modalities beyond traditional checkpoint inhibitor combinations. While numerous studies have explored individual immunotherapy approaches, there is insufficient understanding of how to strategically combine fundamentally different immune-based therapies to create synergistic effects that can overcome the limitations of monotherapy and current dual checkpoint inhibitor approaches. The field lacks a comprehensive framework for what we term \"Dual Distinct Immunotherapy\" (DDI)—the strategic combination of two fundamentally different immunotherapeutic modalities such as combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with oncolytic viruses, adoptive cell therapies, cancer vaccines, or cytokine therapies. Additionally, the potential for incorporating non-immunotherapy sensitizers as third agents to further enhance DDI efficacy remains largely unexplored. This review advances the field by introducing and systematically analyzing the novel concept of DDI, which extends beyond traditional dual checkpoint inhibitor combinations to encompass diverse immunotherapeutic pairings with distinct mechanisms of action. Our work addresses the identified knowledge gaps by: (1) establishing a theoretical framework for DDI that can overcome resistance mechanisms through multi-pathway immune activation; (2) providing comprehensive analysis of synergistic mechanisms underlying various DDI combinations including ICIs with oncolytic viruses, CAR-T cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and RNA-based cancer vaccines; (3) systematically evaluating the potential of third-agent sensitizers such as PCNA inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to create \"DDI + 1\" approaches; and (4) analyzing current clinical evidence and proposing future research directions for these innovative combination strategies. By establishing DDI as a new paradigm that can convert \"cold\" tumors to \"hot\" tumors, overcome resistance mechanisms, and expand the therapeutic window for immunotherapy-resistant cancers, this work provides a roadmap for addressing the most pressing limitations in current cancer immunotherapy and offers a foundation for developing next-generation combination approaches that may significantly improve patient outcomes. Therefore, the targeted, adaptable, and long-lasting nature of immunotherapy makes it a promising option for managing advanced cancers, offering hope for better outcomes and improved quality of life for patients [ 20 1 Fig. 1 Dual distinct immunotherapy (DDI) contains multifaceted advantages. DDI combines two distinct immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance anti-cancer efficacy. The top panel highlights the challenges faced in the post-resistance treatment landscape following dual immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, including limitations in immune pathway exhaustion, delayed development of novel therapies, and the complexity of personalized treatments. Despite these obstacles, DDI holds promise by leveraging synergistic mechanisms to offer significant benefits: improved treatment outcomes through higher response rates and durable responses, expanding indications to address advanced and metastatic cancers, long-term survival potential with improved quality of life, and reduction in treatment-related morbidity Advancing cancer treatment through dual ICI combinations Fortunately, combination therapy regimens based on immunotherapy (such as ICI + targeted therapy, ICI + chemotherapy, and ICI + ICI) have been shown to be superior to traditional systemic treatments (such as targeted therapy and chemotherapy) in many advanced malignancies [ 21 22 23 24 By combining these two ICIs, the goal of CheckMate-9DW trial is to enhance T-cell activation and proliferation, thereby creating a synergistic effect [ 25 The evolution of dual immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations marks a major breakthrough in cancer treatment [ 20 26 27 28 29 Post-resistance treatment shortage following dual ICI combination This resistance leaves patients with limited or no viable treatment alternatives, which is a significant concern in oncology [ 30 31 A. Limitations and Exhaustion in Immune Checkpoint Pathways 32 33 34 35 B. Lag in New Therapy Development 36 31 C. Complexity of Personalized Treatment 31 37 38 39 After resistance to combination ICIs, patients may have limited treatment options, as they may no longer respond to ICIs targeting similar pathways. This can severely compromise the clinical benefits for patients [ 40 41 42 43 44 Thus, a novel treatment strategy named “Dual Distinct Immunotherapy”, presented in this article, holds significant potential to reduce resistance development and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy through multiple pathways by targeting diverse immune mechanisms simultaneously. However, further research is essential to fully understand specific resistance mechanisms and optimize DDI strategies to address them effectively. The critical importance of this issue underscores the need for innovative strategies and therapies to address resistance and ensure ongoing treatment possibilities for patients who have exhausted existing immunotherapy options. This necessitates research into alternative therapeutic combinations, the development of new drugs, and a deeper understanding of resistance mechanisms to enhance future cancer treatment protocols. Dual distinct immunotherapy Dual Immunotherapy (DDI) refers to the strategic combination of two distinct types of antitumor immunotherapies to synergistically enhance the immune system's ability to recognize, attack, and destroy cancer cells more effectively[ 45 46 47 48 Dual immunotherapy shows promise for expanding treatment indications. Through the strategic combination of different immunotherapies, it may potentially target a broader range of cancers, including some traditionally resistant to single-agent immunotherapy [ 49 16 Such combination represents a novel and promising approach in cancer treatment, aiming to harness and amplify the body's immune response through multiple immunotherapeutic strategies [ 50 49 51 DDI has achieved remarkable progress over the past decade, transitioning from basic research in the early 2010s to clinical trials. By 2024, various DDI combination therapies have advanced into multiple clinical trial phases, showcasing significant potential. Current research explores a wide range of therapeutic combinations, including ICIs with OVs, ICIs with T-cell therapies (such as CAR-T or TIL cells), and ICIs with RNA-based cancer vaccines. Additionally, emerging strategies like combining OVs with cell-based therapies or CAR-T cells with RNA-based cancer vaccines are being investigated. These approaches demonstrate strong synergistic effects in enhancing tumor immune recognition, overcoming resistance to monotherapies, and broadening the scope of treatable cancer types. The rapid progression of clinical trials has been supported by recent advances in foundational research, particularly in the modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment and the identification of novel immune targets. The application of DDI has expanded from traditionally immune-sensitive cancers to include less responsive cancers such as head and neck cancer, urothelial carcinoma, and lung cancer. Looking ahead, as more combination strategies progress to late-stage clinical trials and innovative approaches continue to be explored, DDI is poised to further improve patient survival rates and quality of life, paving the way for new possibilities in cancer treatment (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Milestones of DDI Development: The boxes above the timeline display the representative clinical trials of different types of DDI regimen, while the boxes below highlight the most recent preclinical studies. Each box is color-coded to indicate the different combination therapies being explored. Notably, there are currently no ongoing clinical trials involving OVs in combination with NCV While DDI represents a promising paradigm for cancer immunotherapy, it is important to acknowledge that resistance mechanisms in cancer are complex and multifaceted. DDI may help delay the onset of resistance, reduce its severity, or overcome certain resistance pathways through multi-mechanism approaches, but complete prevention of all resistance mechanisms remains an ongoing challenge requiring continued research and development. The evolution of tumor cells, immune evasion strategies, and the dynamic nature of the tumor microenvironment suggest that DDI, while advantageous, should be viewed as part of a broader strategy that may include DDI + 1 approaches and continuous adaptation of treatment protocols based on emerging resistance patterns. Advancing Cancer Treatment Through Dual ICI Combinations. Therefore, this work aims to introduce and establish the paradigm-shifting concept of DDI, which strategically integrates two distinct immunotherapeutic modalities to overcome the limitations of current monotherapies and dual immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations. Through systematic analysis of preclinical evidence and ongoing clinical trials, we seek to demonstrate how DDI can address critical challenges in immunotherapy, including primary and acquired resistance, cold tumor conversion, and pathway exhaustion. Equally important, this work tries to advance the field by evaluating potential third-agent sensitizers, including PCNA inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, to complement DDI strategies in what we term the “DDI + 1” approach. By synthesizing current findings and proposing innovative solutions, a theoretical foundation for DDI has been built, and provides guidance for future research directions and clinical applications in cancer immunotherapy, ultimately aiming to revolutionize cancer treatment paradigms, sitimulating the exploration of novel anti-cancer mechanisms, and improve therapeutic outcomes across diverse cancer types. ICI combined with OVs OVs are a unique class of virus that can specifically attack and eliminate cancer cells without harming normal tissues. This specificity makes oncolytic virotherapy a highly promising strategy in the fight against cancer [ 52 55 56 57 58 59 60 + + 61 62 3 Fig. 3 Synergistic Effects of Oncolytic Viruses (OV) in Enhancing Anti-Tumor Immunity and Overcoming Immune Suppression. A newly discovered OV, named “OactivatePexastimogene Devacirepvec” (Pexa Vec), can elevate the expression levels of antitumor immune cytokines, including IFN-α, IL-3, IL-12p40, IL-16, and IL-18, and activate NK cells as well as CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in tumor tissues. Another, known as the “Newcastle disease virus” (NDV), has been found to exert a synergistic effect when administered in combination with a CTLA-4 inhibitor. Meanwhile, evidence has also indicated that OVs can further improve the early infiltration of CD8 + T cells into tumors and reduce the infiltration by highly suppressive PD-1 + Treg cells. The single-chain variable fragment against human PD-1 (hPD-1scFv), referred to as YST-OVH, enhances the effector and memory functions of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + lymphocytes and mitigates the exhaustion of PD-1hi CTLA-4 + TIM-3 + CD8 + lymphocytes Synergistic mechanisms of immune modulation Evidence has demonstrated that ICIs tend to have reduced efficacy when applied to treat cancers characterized by limited immune cell infiltration, often referred to as the \"immune desert\" phenotype. However, OVs have been shown to stimulate the recruitment of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME). This increased immune cell presence creates an optimal environment, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy [ 63 65 66 66 + + 67 Based on the concept of combinding OVs and ICIs, oncolytic virotherapy which uses single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-armed OVs targeting inhibitory immune checkpoints has also been found to act as an effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy. The convergence of oncolytic virotherapy and immune checkpoint modulation has led to an innovative therapeutic strategy involving engineered viruses armed with scFv targeting immune checkpoints. This strategy leverages the natural tumor-selective properties of OVs while delivering targeted immunomodulatory molecules directly to the tumor microenvironment. By incorporating carefully designed scFv molecules, this approach enables precise targeting of immune checkpoint pathways, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. Therefore, a study developed a functional humanized scFv targeting human PD-1, known as YST-OVH, which demonstrated potent and durable antitumor effects. This therapeutic effect was linked to the expansion and enhancement of effector and memory functions in tumor-infiltrating CD8 + hi + + + 68 68 Application of OVs in combination with ICIs in clinical trials The therapeutic potential of combining OVs with ICIs has been validated through several key clinical investigations, with Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC) leading the way as the first approved viral immunotherapy.

the results of the phase 3 component (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02263508 74 Furthermore, numerous preclinical studies have consistently highlighted that the timing of OV administration, when combined with ICIs, can significantly influence treatment outcomes [ 75 76 78 ICI combined with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell Recent comprehensive reviews have highlighted diverse CAR-T cell combination therapies in hematologic malignancies, providing valuable insights for solid tumor applications [ 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 4 Fig. 4 Enhancing CAR-T Cell Efficacy Through Immune Checkpoint Blockades (ICBs) and Tumor Microenvironment Modulation. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 technology, CAR-T cells engineered to knock out PD-1, TCR, and β2-microglobulin have been equipped with additional ICBs, which enhance cytotoxic activity and improve tumor clearance by CAR-T cells. The triple knockdown of PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3 by shRNAs (short hairpin RNAs) in CD39 + CAR-T cells enhances antitumor activity. The application of a PD-L1 inhibitor to counteract the effects of L-MDSCs effectively restores the antitumor efficacy of CAR-T cells, regulates antigen expression on their cell surface, and mitigates the release of multiple immunosuppressive factors. The combination of PD-L1 inhibition with Oxaliplatin/Cyclophosphamide (Ox/Cy) improves the anticancer effects of CAR-T cells by increasing the number of PD-1 + CAR-T cells and the expression level of PD-L1, thereby enhancing the tumor microenvironment (TME) through the modulation of immunostimulatory signal secretion, such as IL-12 and IL-15, and by reducing the effects of immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-4. ICBs inhibit IL-10, IL-4, and TGF-β in the TME, while the PD-1 inhibitor restores the production of TNF-α and IFN-γ, thereby facilitating anti-cancer immunity Synergistic mechanisms of immune modulation Targeting the multiple antigens Malignant solid tumors often exhibit antigenic heterogeneity by expressing different antigens on cell surface [ 86 87 88 89 For instance, CAR-T cells generated by knocking out PD-1, β-2 microglobulin and TCR through CRISPR/Cas9 technology that has been endowed extra Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), displayed the enhanced cytotoxic activity and tumor clearance of CAR-T cells [ 90 + 91 + 91 92 Modifying the tumor immunosuppression microenvironment The cancer related microenvironment is a complex and evolving entity.

However, this combined approach was still under investigation in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials. There were also ongoing investigations into the optimal timing and sequencing of these therapies, as well as potential safety concerns related to increased immune-related side effects. The trials differ based on the agents applied, dosing strategies, and schedules for administration. Clinical trials and ongoing research aim to optimize the combination of ICIs and CAR-T cell therapy for solid cancer treatment, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes. This will offer the clearest understanding of the future potential of this approach for treating solid tumors and will provide guidance on strategies to develop new methods for studying combination therapies that can deliver these breakthrough treatments to patients. ICI Combined with Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) Lymphocytes, made up of B cells and T cells which play a crucial effective apparatuses in anti-cancer immunity, can recognize cancer cells as abnormal and penetrate into them [ 119 121 122 123 124 125 126 Synergistic mechanisms of immune modulation Enhanced tumor recognition One of the main issues of applying TIL has been reported is that cancer cells can still express immune checkpoint molecules that dampen the T cell response, even the TIL therapy had been equipped with T cells that can recognize cancer antigens and kill cancer cells. Therefore, ICIs are introduced to block checkpoint molecules expressed by cancer cells and guarantee the efficacy of TILs [ 127 128 Increased T cell function and persistence ICIs have been reported to be able to restore T cell function and prevent T cells from being exhausted or suppressed, by releasing immune checkpoints [ 129 130 131 132 + 133 Overcoming immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment Tumor cells have been found to be able to generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment that hampers the function of TILs [ 134 127 135 Clinical trials exploring combination therapy with ICI and TIL Recent clinical studies investigating the combination of TIL therapy and ICIs have shown encouraging therapeutic potential in several cancer types. This combined strategy seeks to boost anti-tumor immune responses by utilizing the complementary mechanisms of both treatment approaches.

However, their production processes are indeed time-consuming, expensive, and laborious, which limits their widespread availability. The current production methods involve surgical resection to obtain tumor tissue, followed by the collection and expansion of TILs in the laboratory. As a result, they can only be developed at a limited number of leading research institutions and companies in a few countries. To overcome these barriers and improve the accessibility of TIL therapy, a key focus is finding methods to preserve TILs after extraction without extending the processing time. This involves optimizing the culture conditions and developing specialized media to keep the TILs viable and functional. Another important aspect is improving the stability of TILs during the expansion and production phases. Identifying prognostic biomarkers is crucial for personalized treatment with TIL therapy. By understanding the biomarkers associated with specific patients, healthcare professionals can better predict the likelihood of a positive clinical response and tailor the treatment accordingly. This area of research aims to improve patient selection and optimize treatment outcomes. In addition, T cells were found to react to various tumor antigens. However, additional research is required to identify the threshold of polyclonality or the range of antigens targeted by the infused TIL repertoire that is essential for achieving a lasting clinical response. In summary, while TIL therapy offers promising prospects for solid tumor treatment, there are a number of obstacles that need to be addressed to improve its accessibility and effectiveness. Ongoing research is focused on improving TIL production processes, sustaining TILs, identifying prognostic biomarkers, genetically modifying TILs, and understanding the optimal antigen diversity required for durable clinical responses. These efforts aim to expand the reach and enhance the efficacy of TIL therapy in the future. ICI combined with RNA-based cancer vaccines The landscape of cancer immunotherapy has been revolutionized by RNA-based vaccines, which represent an innovative therapeutic approach targeting specific genetic expressions in cancer treatment. These advanced interventions encompass multiple sophisticated mechanisms, including RNA interference through small interfering RNAs, precision genetic modifications via CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided systems, and therapeutic applications of messenger RNA molecules [ 139 140 141 140 5 142 143 Fig. 5 Synergistic Effects of Neoantigen Cancer Vaccines and Immune Checkpoint Blockades in Enhancing Anti-Tumor Immunity. The bi-adjuvant neoantigen nanovaccine (banNV), when combined with anti-PD-1, substantially potentiates the immunotherapeutic efficacy and can mediate cancer regression in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. The combination therapy with αCTLA-4 and NCV enhances neoantigen-specific T cell immune responses. A CT2A-specific NVC, when combined with anti-PD-L1 blockade, was found to increase the presence of neoantigen-specific T cells within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In addition, the combination of NCV and anti-PD-1 potentiates neoantigen-specific immunity, elicit robust and long-lived T cell responses with a more diversified T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, and inhibit cancer growth Synergistic mechanisms of immune modulation Overcome suppressive microenvironment The tumor microenvironment presents significant obstacles to effective immune responses, including checkpoint-mediated suppression, immunosuppressive cellular networks, and inhibitory factors released during tumor cell death [ 144 145 146 Priming of T cell responses The addition of RNA-based cancer vaccines to checkpoint inhibition therapy demonstrates remarkable effects on T cell responses, both in \"hot\" and \"cold\" tumors. In hot tumors, this combination expands the cytotoxic T cell repertoire, while in cold tumors, it helps establish an immunologically active environment. These effects substantially broaden the population of patients who might benefit from immunotherapy [ 142 147 148 149 Clinical trials exploring combination therapy with ICI and RNA-based cancer vaccines The first open-label trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02897765 150 The RO7198457 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03289962 151 Further advances in RNA vaccine technology emerged through the mRNA-4157 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03313778 152 NCT03422094 153 4 Table 4 Clinical trial of ICIs combination therapy with NCVs for solid tumor Treatment Trial number Launch Phase Study status ICI agent Cancer vaccine agent Tumor type Rfs NCT05153304 2021 I/II Not yet recruiting Nivolumab Personalized vaccine Cancer of Gastrointestinal Tract [ 435 NCT05528952 2022 II Recruiting Atezolizumab CD4 Th1-inducer Cancer Vaccine (UCPVax) HCC [ 436 NCT05456165 2022 II Terminated Atezolizumab/Ipilimumab Individualized neoantigen vaccine Colonic Neoplasms Colorectal Neoplasms [ 437 NCT03361852 2017 II Recruiting Pembrolizumab Personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine Follicular Lymphoma [ 438 NCT05141721 2021 II/III Recruiting Atezolizumab/Ipilimumab Neoantigen vaccine(GRT-C901/GRT-R902) Colorectal Neoplasms [ 439 NCT05075122 2021 II Recruiting Pembrolizumab UV1 vaccination Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma [ 440 NCT04418219 2020 I/II Withdrawn Pembrolizumab Breast Cancer Vaccine (SV-BR-1-GM) Breast Cancer [ 441 NCT04024878 2019 I/II Recruiting Nivolumab Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine (NeoVax) Ovarian Cancer [ 442 NCT04263051 2020 II Recruiting Nivolumab CD4 Th1-inducer Cancer Vaccine (UCPVax) Advanced NSCLC [ 436 NCT04369937 2020 II Recruiting Pembrolizumab HPV-16 E6/E7 specific therapeutic vaccination (ISA101b) HPV-Related Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma [ 443 NCT04382664 2020 II Recruiting Ipilimumab/Nivolumab cancer vaccine (UV1) Malignant Melanoma [ 444 NCT03946358 2019 II Active, not recruiting Atezolizumab CD4 Th1-inducer Cancer Vaccine (UCPVax) Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck, Anal Canal Cancer Cervical Cancer [ 445 NCT04161755 2019 I Active, not recruiting Atezolizumab personalized cancer vaccine (PCV) Pancreatic Cancer [ 446 NCT03970746 2019 I/II Recruiting Pembrolizumab PDC*lung01 Non Small Cell Lung Cancer [ 447 NCT04040231 2019 I Active, not recruiting Nivolumab Galinpepimut-S Mesothelioma, Pleural Mesothelioma Wilms Tumor [ 448 NCT03953235 2019 I/II Active, not recruiting Nivolumab/Ipilimumab Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine Solid Tumor [ 448 NCT03897881 2019 II Recruiting Pembrolizumab Pembrolizumab Melanoma [ 449 NCT03359239 2017 I Completed(December 2017) Atezolizumab PGV001 Urothelial/Bladder Cancer, Nos [ 450 NCT04161755 2019 N/A Active, not recruiting Atezolizumab Personalized Tumor Vaccines (PCVs) Pancreatic Cancer [ 451 Potential challenges and future directions Neoantigens are generated from tumor-specific mutations and vary widely across different tumors and patients. This high degree of heterogeneity can lead to a suboptimal response to both RNA-based cancer vaccines and ICIs. To address this challenge, designing a neoantigen vaccine with multiple targets, which takes into account the tumor’s heterogeneity, may help overcome intra-tumor variability and its evolving alterations. In addition, the identification of neoantigens remains a significant hurdle. It requires extensive tumor tissue samples, and the yield of viable epitopes or neoantigens is often minimal, making it difficult to overcome with current technical capabilities. These challenges have substantially hindered the clinical progress of neoantigen vaccines. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more accurate neoantigen prediction algorithms and more efficient manufacturing technologies that can reduce costs and shorten development timelines, thereby accelerating the clinical application of neoantigen-based therapies. CAR-T cell combined with OVs Recent research has illuminated the potential synergistic benefits of combining OVs with CAR-T cell therapy for treating solid tumors. This therapeutic approach leverages multiple complementary mechanisms to enhance treatment efficacy The combination functions through several key pathways. First, OVs directly lyse cancer cells, releasing tumor-associated antigens. This continuous release of antigens helps prevent antigen loss, a common challenge in CAR-T cell therapy. Second, OVs work to reverse the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment, thereby supporting improved persistence of CAR-T cells within the tumor site. Third, OVs can be engineered to express therapeutic molecules such as chemokines, further enhancing their therapeutic potential. This combination strategy specifically addresses several traditional barriers that have limited CAR-T cell efficacy in solid tumors. The ability to modify OVs provides multiple opportunities to overcome these obstacles. This combination exemplifies enhanced cellular therapy approaches that are revolutionizing adoptive immunotherapy [ 154 Synergistic mechanisms of immune modulation Increase the efficiency of CAR-T cell trafficking and persistence within cancer The immunosuppressive TME is primarily manifested through the deficiency of pro-T cell cytokines, which enables tumors to circumvent cytotoxic T cell responses [ 155 156 157 This suggests that the direct delivery of CXCL11 by the oncolytic virus enhances immune cell recruitment and improves the overall therapeutic effect. This combination approach has shown particular promise in challenging cancer types, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. OVs modified to express TNF-α and IL-2 worked synergistically with CAR-T cells to overcome the characteristically immunosuppressive microenvironment. This combination successfully promoted M1 macrophage polarization and dendritic cell (DC) maturation, effectively preventing metastasis despite the aggressive nature of the disease [ 158 159 160 Overcome the attenuation of antigen escape induced by T-cell immunotherapy Cytotoxic T-cells show significant potential in targeting cancer cells that express specific antigens. However, a major challenge arises when initial T-cell interventions eliminate antigen-expressing cancer cells, leaving behind resistant tumor populations that are no longer targeted. This selective pressure can lead to tumor immune evasion and subsequent disease progression [ 161 162 163 Clinical trials exploring combination therapy with CAR-T cell and OVs Despite the promising preclinical results, only a few clinical trials investigating the combination of CAR-T cells and OVs are currently underway, underscoring the challenges of translating this approach to clinical practice. One of the first-in-human phase I clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03740256 146 Another phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05057715 147 5 NCT05057715 Table 5 Clinical trial of CAR-T cell combination therapy with OVs for solid tumor Treatment Trial Number Launch Phase Study status CAR-T cell target agent OVs agent Tumor type Rfs NCT03740256 2018 N/A Recruiting HER2 specific CAR T cells CAdVEC Solid Tumor [ 409 NCT05057715 2021 I Recruiting huCART-meso Cells VCN-01 Pancreatic Cancer Serous Ovarian Cancer [ 413 Potential challenges and future directions The combination of CAR-T cells ad OVs and holds significant promise for cancer treatment, offering a multifaceted approach to overcome the limitations of traditional therapies. However, several challenges need to be addressed for successful clinical implementation of this combined therapy. One of the most critical concerns is the host's immune response to the viral component of the therapy. Neutralizing antibodies and cytokine secretion, particularly interferons (IFNs), can trigger a robust anti-viral immune response, leading to viral clearance and reduced viral replication. This immune response may diminish the effectiveness of the oncolytic virus and reduce its potential to enhance CAR-T cell activity in the tumor microenvironment [ 164 In addition to viral immune responses, the safety profile of CAR-T cells requires rigorous evaluation, whether used alone or combined with OVs. While showing promising efficacy across various cancers, CAR-T cell therapy can cause serious adverse effects, including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, which demand careful management, particularly in combination treatments [ 165 CAR-T cell combined with RNA-based cancer vaccines CAR-T cell therapy involves engineering T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors that specifically target cancer antigens [ 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 s 6 Fig. 6 Enhancing CAR-T Cell Therapy Through mRNA Vaccines, Oncolytic Viruses, and Immune Modulation Strategies. CAR-T cell therapy is a novel form of immunotherapy that uses genetic engineering to modify T cells for targeted antigen recognition and precise activation. Combining CAR-T cell therapy with mRNA cancer vaccines can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells and address the challenges associated with CAR-T cell therapy in solid cancers, such as mRNA-4157 and the vaccine encoding mRNA for CLDN6. Moreover, various strategies can be employed using oncolytic viruses (OVs) to overcome the barriers in CAR-T cell therapy for solid cancers. These strategies can help spread tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) through the direct lytic effect on cancer cells, thereby preventing antigen loss and reversing tumor-mediated immunosuppression. Examples include oncolytic adenovirus (OAds), oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV) expressing CXCL11, rAd.sT, IL7-expressing oncolytic virus, and oncolytic vaccinia virus carrying CD19t (OV19t). Additionally, a booster vaccine can activate CAR-T cells, allowing the immune system to recognize other tumor antigens and generate a “memory” T cell population capable of targeting these antigens. OVs expressing TNF-α and IL-2 have a robust anti-tumor effect, exerted by promoting the M1 polarization of macrophages and the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). The oncolytic adenovirus armed with an EGFR-targeting bispecific T-cell engager (OAd-BiTE) can increase cytokine production and cytotoxicity, thereby improving the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy Synergistic mechanisms of immune modulation RNA-based cancer vaccines promote the proliferation and killing efficacy of CAR-T cells and prolong the maintenance of CAR-T cells' effector functions RNA-based cancer vaccines, particularly therapeutic ones, primarily function by triggering T-cell immune responses [ 174 175 The researchers subsequently conducted a series of in vivo experiments that demonstrated the effectiveness of a low dose of CLDN6-LPX in inducing substantial expansions of CLDN6-CAR-T cells. These expanded cells exhibited full functionality, including robust cytokine secretion and potent cell-killing capabilities. Finally, by creating mouse or human tumor models in mice, the researchers confirmed that CLDN6 LPX could significantly enhance the therapeutic impact of CAR T cells on solid tumors. Notably, CLDN6 LPX allowed for a reduction in the required dose of CAR T cell therapy, preserved the longevity of CAR T cells while minimizing toxicity, and extended the treatment's effectiveness. RNA-based cancer vaccines promote memory formation of CAR-T cells and overcome limitations of the suppressive immune microenvironment One of the challenges in using CAR-T therapies against solid tumors is their limited efficacy, primarily due to the immunosuppressive environment typically created by tumors, which can render T cells ineffective before they reach their intended targets. To address this issue, a research team turned their focus to leveraging the abundance of immune cells in lymph nodes. They developed a strategy involving the delivery of a vaccine directly to the lymph nodes to activate CAR-T cells at that location [ 176 176 Clinical trials exploring combination therapy with CAR-T cell and mRNA cancer vaccines Currently, there is only one clinical trial exploring the potential of combining CAR-T cell therapy with RNA-based vaccines for cancer treatment. This Phase I/IIa study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04503278 177 These preliminary results suggest that CLDN6 CAR-T cell therapy combination with CAR-Vac, is not only safe but also holds considerable therapeutic promise for patients with CLDN6-positive cancers (Table 6 Table 6 Clinical trial of CAR-T cell combination therapy with mRNA cancer vaccines for solid tumor Treatment Trial number Launch Phase Study status CAR-T cell target agent Cancer vaccine agent Tumor type Rfs NCT04503278 2020 I Recruiting CLDN6 CAR-T CLDN6 RNA-LPX CLDN6-positive relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors [ 452 Potential challenges and future directions Compared to traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccine production offers notable advantages in terms of manufacturing flexibility and rapid scalability, particularly in response to emerging infectious diseases [ 178 179 OVs combined with TIL Autologous TIL immunotherapy, an adoptive cell transfer approach, has emerged as an effective strategy for advanced solid tumor treatment[ 80 123 180 181 182 7 Fig. 7 Synergistic Enhancement of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy Through Oncolytic Virus-Induced Immunogenic Modulation and Activation. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can identify and kill tumor cells, producing cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which play an important role in their activation and proliferation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) can re-engage in inducing apoptosis of tumor cells and recruit other immune cells to the tumor site. The induction of Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD) by oncolytic viruses (OVs), which released Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAAs) and recruited Tumor-Associated Neutrophils (TANs), transformed 'cold' tumors into 'hot' tumors with increased TIL accumulation, reprogrammed macrophages toward a more M1-like phenotype. The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-based oncolytic virus encoding OX40L and IL-12 (OV-OX40L/IL12) converted tumor cells into artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs), providing local signals and enhancing T cell activation and killing in coculture with TILs. The oncolytic adenovirus coding tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (Ad5/3-E2F-D24-hTNFa-IRES-hIL2; TILT-123) recruited more TILs, enhanced cytotoxicity, and held promise for promoting substantial immunological activation of locoregional TILs and counteracted immunosuppression. The combination of OV and TIL therapy using an interleukin-2 (IL-2)-armed oncolytic poxvirus, which leads to a lower percentage of exhausted PD-1hi Tim-3 + CD8 + T cells and Regulatory T cells (Tregs) Synergistic mechanisms of immune modulation OVs enhance the activation and persistence of TILs In recent research, scientists utilized OVs to transform tumor cells into artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs). Using a herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-based OVs encoding OX40L and IL12 (OV-OX40L/IL12), they provided local signals for T cell activation. Infected tumor cells showed enhanced expression of antigen-presenting cell (APC) markers, improving T cell activation and killing in TIL coculture [ 183 Another study found synergistic antitumor effects when combining OVs with TIL therapy, attributed to viral infection and T cell immune stimulation [ 184 Overcoming immunosuppression Research has shown that TILT-123 (Ad5/3-E2F-D24-hTNFa-IRES-hIL2), an OVs designed to deliver TNFα and IL-2, shows promise in promoting significant immune activation of local TILs. In ovarian cancer, this virus encoding TNF-α and IL-2 can counter immunosuppression and enhance TIL antitumor responses [ 185 Research demonstrated that combining interleukin-2 (IL-2)-armed OVs with TIL therapy promoted tumor-specific TIL accumulation in hypoimmunogenic tumors, while reducing the proportion of exhausted PD-1 hi + + 186 Clinical trials exploring combination therapy with Ovs and mRNA cancer vaccines TILT-123 (igrelimogene litadenorepvec) is an engineered OVs that selectively replicates in cancer cells and expresses dual transgenes IL-2 and TNF-α, designed to enhance tumor immune infiltration and cytotoxic T-cell responses [ 187 NCT04217473 187 + + In a phase I, open-label, 3 + 3 dose-escalation multicenter trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04217473 188 7 Table 7 Clinical trial of OVs combination therapy with TIL cell for solid tumor Treatment Trial Number Launch Phase Study Status CAR-T cell target Agent TIL Agent Tumor type Rfs NCT04217473 2020 I Recruiting TILT-123 TIL Metastatic melanoma patients Potential challenges and future directions Although the combination of OVs therapy with TILs shows great promise in the field of cancer treatment, it also poses a number of challenges. It is essential to comprehend these challenges and explore potential future directions to advance the effectiveness of this combination approach. Cancer cells can develop various mechanisms to evade immune responses, such as downregulating MHC expression or secreting immunosuppressive cytokines. Combining OVs with TILs may face resistance from these evasion strategies. Developing improved delivery systems for OVs to ensure efficient and targeted delivery to the tumor site, thereby maximizing their therapeutic impact in combination with TILs. OVs combined with RNA-based cancer vaccines Combining OVs with RNA-based cancer vaccines is a promising approach in cancer therapy. Both OVs and RNA-based cancer vaccines target cancer cells, but they do so through different mechanisms, and their combination can enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment. OVs and RNA-based cancer vaccines function through complementary mechanisms. OVs can induce an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and release antigens, while RNA-based cancer vaccines contribute to the enhanced recognition of specific neoantigens by the immune system. Furthermore, OVs play a role in increasing the presentation of tumor antigens, including neoantigens, potentially amplifying the immune response initiated by RNA-based cancer vaccines. The collaborative action of these two therapeutic modalities may lead to a synergistic activation of the immune system, resulting in a more robust and sustained anti-tumor response. This combined strategy capitalizes on the unique strengths of both OVs and RNA-based cancer vaccines, providing a comprehensive and potentially more effective approach in cancer treatment (Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Mechanisms of Oncolytic Virus (OVs) and Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine (NCV) Combination Therapy in Sustaining Enhanced Anti-Tumor Immunity. OVs can directly dissolve tumor cells, simultaneously releasing antigens to enhance the immune system's recognition of tumor cells. In addition, they can enhance the anti-tumor effect of DC vaccines by increasing the infiltration of CD8 + T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, thanks to the priming effect of the NCVs, the designed specific neoantigens can target CDSE1 gene mutations to maintain or enhance immune responses. In conclusion, the combination therapy of these two methods can activate and sustain a continuous immune response, leading to more prolonged and effective anti-tumor effects (abbreviation: TTAs: full name: tumor-associated antigens) Synergistic mechanisms of immune modulation Overcoming the immune escape resistance of tumor cells Tumor cells treated with OVs can evolve mechanisms to evade the virus, diminishing treatment efficacy. In a clinical trial using interferon beta-expressing lysosomal vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-IFNβ), some patients experienced aggressive relapses after initial remission. Notably, researchers identified the predictable mutations in the CDSE1 gene, which normally inhibits virus replication. Mutations in CDSE1, serving as a \"fallback\" for tumor cells, also produce a unique antigen recognized by immune system T cells. To combat predictable resistance, researchers developed a vaccine targeting the mutated CDSE1 gene. Combining lysosomal virus therapy with this vaccine effectively reduced the size of tumors and prolonged the survival of mice in experimental studies [ 189 Overcoming immunosuppression OVs therapy is a promising strategy to counteract immunosuppression and reveal TAAs; thus, it could work synergistically with DC vaccines. A study has demonstrated that OVs M1 (OVM) significantly enhance the antitumor effects of DC vaccines in several syngeneic mouse tumor models. This enhancement is attributed to the increased infiltration of CD8 + 190 8 Table 8 Preclinical study of OVs combination therapy with NCV for solid tumor Treatment OVs agent NCV agents Potential mechanisms in combination therapy Level of evidence Tumor type Rfs Oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon beta (VSV-IFNβ) CSDE1 P5S CSDE1 P5S Murine melanoma (B16) and human HCC (Hep3B); Human Mel888 melanoma cells Melanoma and HCC [ 189 Oncolytic virus M1 (OVM) DC vaccines Downregulate SIRPα in DCs and CD47 in tumor cells and upregulates PD-L1 in DCs, Mouse models of melanoma (B16), colorectal (CT-26), renal (RM-1), and pancreatic cancer (Pan02) Melanoma, colorectal, renal, hepatic and pancreatic cancer [ 190 rVSV-LCMVG mRNA cancer vaccine express gp33 epitope Induce the generation of virus-specific T cells and inhibited tumor cell proliferation Mouse models of melanoma (B16) Melanoma and HCC [ 453 Potential challenges and future directions While the combination of OVs and RNA-based cancer vaccines shows promise, several challenges need to be addressed. The identification of patient-specific neoantigens requires advanced genomic and bioinformatic analyses, which may not be universally available or efficient. Consequently, there is a pressing need to enhance the identification and validation of neoantigens [ 191 192 Combination of ICI with emerging CAR-based therapies In addition to CAR-T cells, emerging engineered cellular therapies such as CAR-NK cells and CAR macrophages represent innovative and promising platforms for solid tumor immunotherapy, especially when combined with ICIs in DDI and DDI + 1 strategies. CAR-NK cells harness the natural cytotoxicity of NK cells alongside CAR-mediated specificity, offering several distinct advantages over CAR-T cells, including lower risk of cytokine release syndrome and graft-versus-host disease, and the potential for off-the-shelf allogeneic products [ 193 194 NCT03940820 NCT04623944 + 195 196 197 198 In parallel, CAR macrophages (CAR-M) represent a novel class of cellular immunotherapy that leverages the tumor-homing and plasticity of macrophages. CAR-M therapies can remodel the tumor microenvironment by maintaining pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotypes and counteracting immunosuppressive M2 macrophages. Their superior phagocytic activity and antigen-presenting function make them ideal candidates for combination with ICIs, which support sustained T cell activation and immune memory [ 199 200 Safety considerations in CAR-T based immune combinations CAR-T cell therapies have revolutionized treatment for hematologic malignancies, but their application in solid tumors often requires combination strategies to overcome immune evasion. Understanding CAR T-cell hematological toxicities, including their manifestations, mechanisms, and management strategies, is crucial for safe implementation of combination therapies [ 201 Safety considerations: managing iraes in DDI While DDI enhances anti-tumor responses, it also increases the risk of irAEs, which may compromise patient safety and treatment continuity. These toxicities, resulting from excessive immune activation, can affect multiple organ systems and vary based on treatment combinations. Common irAEs include dermatologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hepatic, pulmonary, and neurologic complications. For instance, the CheckMate-9DW trial showed that nivolumab plus ipilimumab improved response rates (45% vs. 28%) but also led to higher toxicity (grade ≥ 3 irAEs: 32% vs. 15%). Among DDIs, dual immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1/CTLA-4) have the highest irAE burden, while combinations with CAR-T, TILs, or oncolytic viruses (OVs) introduce additional risks like cytokine release syndrome (CRS). In contrast, ICI + RNA vaccine regimens are generally well tolerated but still require irAE vigilance due to the ICI component. Effective irAE prevention begins with careful patient selection and risk stratification. Patients with autoimmune disease, organ dysfunction, or prior severe irAEs should be assessed with biomarkers (e.g., CRP, IL-6, NLR) and functional baselines. Strategies such as sequential drug administration (e.g., delayed ipilimumab post-nivolumab) and low-dose corticosteroid prophylaxis have reduced toxicity without compromising efficacy. Targeted prevention tools—like TNF-α blockade in high-risk patients or microbiome modulation (e.g., probiotics, dietary interventions)—are also gaining traction. Routine monitoring should include baseline organ function panels, structured symptom tracking, and early referral for grade ≥ 2 irAEs. Special considerations are required for CAR-T or OV-based regimens, which carry unique toxicity profiles including CRS and viral replication risks. Management of irAEs must be tailored to both regimen type and toxicity severity. ICI-only regimens follow established algorithms: grade 1 irAEs may continue therapy, while grade 2–4 events require corticosteroids or treatment cessation. For cellular therapies or combinations with OVs, high-dose corticosteroids, IL-6 blockade, and neurologic monitoring are often necessary. Although RNA-based vaccine combinations typically produce mild symptoms, close observation remains essential. Elderly and comorbid patients may benefit from dose adjustments and enhanced supportive care. Rechallenge after irAE resolution is generally acceptable for grade 1–2 events but not for grade 3–4 toxicities. Looking ahead, predictive biomarkers, safer immunotherapeutic designs (e.g., suicide switches, tissue-specific targeting), and AI-assisted monitoring are poised to improve irAE prediction and management. Standardized reporting of irAEs in DDI trials is critical to ensure safety and inform future therapeutic optimization. Future research directions for further optimization of DDI strategy DDI represents a frontier in cancer treatment, focusing on combining two distinct immunotherapeutic approaches to amplify the body's immune response against cancer cells. Future research will likely delve into optimizing combinations of ICIs with other forms of immunotherapy, such as cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, and cytokine therapy. Additionally, expanding the scope of DDI to cover a broader range of cancer types, especially those resistant to single-agent therapies, is a critical area of exploration. The development of next-generation ICIs that target new pathways beyond PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 will be another significant focus, aiming to overcome resistance mechanisms and provide more durable treatment responses. Identifying a suitable potential third agent to enhance the efficacy of x combination therapy Combining different types of immunotherapies, known as dual immunotherapy, mentioned above, has shown promising results in treating various cancers. To enhance the efficacy and overcome resistance, adding a third non-immunotherapy drug could provide broader therapeutic benefits [ 202 202 TKIs can block specific enzymes involved in signaling pathways that promote cancer cell growth and survival [ 203 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 212 213 214 216 217 218 Recent advances have also proposed novel strategies to improve dual immunotherapy outcomes. For example, combination strategies with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade continue to evolve [ 219 220 221 Incorporating a third non-immunotherapy agent with dual immunotherapy is for providing a multi-faceted approach to cancer treatment. Each category of agents presents unique mechanisms and challenges that must be addressed to maximize therapeutic benefits and minimize adverse effects. Here, we summarize several novel potential sensitizers for Dual Immunotherapy. Compared to commonly used traditional drugs, these sensitizers offer superior improvements in anti-tumor immunity and may exhibit better synergistic effects in cancer immunotherapy, holding significant research potential [ 222 223 9 Fig. 9 Mechanisms of a potential third agent in combination with DDI. PCNAis combined with DI could hold promise in cancer therapy by disrupting immune evasion and enhancing immune responses. Targeting PCNA with APIM-peptide affects key signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt and MAPK, which are involved in metastasis. In monocytes, APIM-peptide reduces Akt phosphorylation and cytokine secretion (e.g., CXCL10, IFN-β) after TLR stimulation. Additionally, 2α-hydroxyursolic acid inhibits PCNA expression in breast cancer cells, regulating the p38/MAPK pathway to reduce proliferation and promote apoptosis. HDACis enhance tumor antigen expression and immune-related genes, making tumor cells more visible to the immune system. When combined with DDI, such as PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibitors, HDACis like entinostat (ENT) and azacytidine (AZA) improve immune cell activity, reduce metastasis, and decrease immunosuppressive cells (e.g., FoxP3 + Tregs and G-MDSCs). HDACis also modulate tumor-infiltrating cell phenotypes and gene expression pathways, further boosting immune responses. Additionally, inhibiting HDAC3 suppresses the CXCL8/CXCR2 axis, enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). CAi like SLC-0111 has shown promise in preclinical models of breast and brain cancer by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. In HCC, combining CAIi with anti–PD-1 antibodies enhanced therapeutic efficacy by reducing metastasis and improving survival. CAis like Tiliroside also restore immune cell function and reduce tumor progression. In triple-negative breast cancer, SLC-0111 increased pH shifts in the tumor microenvironment, sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Additionally, combining CAi with glutamine metabolism disruption promotes ferroptosis. CAIX-targeted CAR-T cells and combination therapies further enhance immune responses in solid tumors. ncRNAs can regulate the immune microenvironment and immune checkpoints to exert anti-tumor effects. For example, piR-823 promotes the degradation of PINK1, triggering a Warburg effect and inflammasome activation, which sensitizes tumors to DDI. Additionally, miR-149-3p downregulates PD-1, TIM-3, and BTLA, preventing tumor immune escape and enhancing T-cell function. MTL-CEBPA, a small activating RNA (saRNA), reduces the immunosuppressive effects of myeloid cells and boosts ICI efficacy by upregulating C/EBP-α Potential candidates Proliferating cell nuclear antigen inhibitors (PCNAis) PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) inhibitor has also been considered as a potential sensitizer for DDI, which is essential for critical processes in cellular function including DNA replication and repair [ 224 225 226 227 228 230 231 232 235 224 233 236 Current clinical trials of combing PCNAi with DDI or monotherapy Evidence suggests that PCNA, when expressed on the surface of cancer cells, can interact with NKp44 to inhibit the antitumor function of NK cells. In this context, PCNAi has emerged as a potential immune checkpoint blockade strategy, capable of enhancing NK-cell-mediated antitumor responses [ 237 239 240 241 231 Hence, combining PCNAi with DDI holds significant research value, offering extensive opportunities for further study and potential clinical benefits (Table 9 Table 9 Clinical trial and preclinical study of dual immunotherapy combination therapy with the 3rd agent Trial Number Launch Phase Study status 3rd agent Immunotherapy Agents Potential Mechanisms In combination therapy Level of evidence Tumor type Rfs – – – – mAb 14–25-9 mAb 14–25-9 Enhance the functional activity of NK cells overexpressing NKp44-Iso;

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the stress-induced intracellular tyrosine kinase c-ABL have been identified as key regulators of tyrosine 211 phosphorylation of PCNA (pY211-PCNA). This modification partially stabilizes chromatin-associated PCNA, thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation, particularly in breast cancer [ 225 242 225 243 244 ATX-101, a novel cell-penetrating peptide containing APIM, is a PCNAi that disrupts PCNA-protein interactions and has shown significant anti-cancer activity as a single agent in multiple cancer cell lines and models [ 232 245 232 246 247 248 249 AOH1160 and AOH1996 are also small-molecule compounds that target PCNA and have demonstrated promising anti-cancer activity [ 235 250 235 251 AOH1996, another small-molecule compound, specifically binds to a region in the PIP-box binding pocket of PCNA, interfering with the interaction between PCNA and RNA polymerase II (RPB1). This interference prevents RNA polymerase II from properly binding to DNA, resulting in DNA double-strand breaks under transcription-dependent conditions [ 250 NCT05227326 Recent investigations have centered on emerging small-molecule inhibitors, notably PCNA-I1S and T2AA, which specifically target PCNA through direct binding interactions. Experimental studies evaluating PCNA-I1S in combination with DNA-damaging agents demonstrated enhanced antiproliferative effects in prostate and lung cancer cell lines. This synergistic interaction suggests the potential utility of PCNA-I1S as a chemotherapy and radiotherapy sensitizer [ 233 252 234 253 254 Potential for applying PCNAi as the third agent in DDI Integrating PCNA inhibitors into dual immunotherapy regimens holds significant potential to enhance antitumor efficacy by disrupting immune evasion mechanisms and boosting immune responses. These inhibitors not only sensitize cancer cells to treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy but also target key pathways in cancer cells, positioning them as a promising addition to future immunotherapy strategies. By synergizing with HDAC inhibitors and ICIs, PCNAis could create a more robust and sustained immune response, offering a promising avenue for advancing cancer treatment. Potential challenges for conducting related study The success of dual immunotherapy often relies on the synergistic effects between agents. Optimizing the ideal candidate, dosage, and timing of PCNA-targeted agents in combination with other immunotherapies is a complex challenge that demands extensive preclinical and clinical testing. To overcome these challenges, further research and development are crucial to refine the use of PCNAis in dual immunotherapy and ensure their safe and effective integration into cancer treatment protocols. Histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACis) HDACis plays a crucial role in tumor development and progression by altering gene expression through histone deacetylation, leading to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and the promotion of oncogenic pathway [ 255 256 Current clinical trials of combing HDACis with DDI or monotherapy A novel three-drug combination, including an HDACi, has shown promising results in patients with advanced HER2-negative breast cancer. This regimen, which combines an HDACi with two types of checkpoint inhibitors, was evaluated in a multicenter Phase Ib study ( NCT02453620 257 A Phase 1b clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03565406 258 In another study, a feasibility trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04871594 The DONIMI trial, a Phase 1b study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04133948 259 9 Potential mechanisms of applying HDACi as the 3rd agent for DDI HDACis are a class of compounds that interfere with the function of histone deacetylases [ 260 256 261 262 Research demonstrated significant effects when combining HDACis (entinostat and azacytidine) with PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade. All five mice treated with anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 antibodies plus HDACis showed complete primary tumor elimination without metastasis [ 263 263 + 263 Another study demonstrated that combining entinostat with anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, or both significantly improved tumor-free survival in HER2/neu transgenic breast cancer and Panc02 metastatic pancreatic cancer mouse models. Entinostat enhanced granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells infiltration while converting their immunosuppressive capacity to a nonfunctional phenotype. Flow cytometry and gene expression profiling revealed alterations in functional molecule expression and genetic pathways related to proliferation and motility in treated tumors [ 264 Additionally, existing evidence indicates that elevated baseline CXCL8 (IL-8) levels in plasma are associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients undergoing immunotherapy, such as nivolumab or ipilimumab, suggesting that CXCL8 could serve as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of ICI treatment [ 265 266 267 268 267 269 181 270 271 Consequently, the combination of HDACi with DDI is assumed to be an extremely novel but promising therapeutic strategy with significant potential for clinical application and research. This approach offers new opportunities to further improve the overall prognosis of cancer patients. Potential for applying HDACi as the third agent in DDI Based on the definition of DDI as the strategic combination of two distinct types of antitumor immunotherapies to synergistically enhance the immune system's ability to combat cancer, HDACis have shown potential to significantly amplify DDI’s effectiveness. HDACis, by increasing the expression of tumor antigens and modifying the tumor microenvironment, enhance the infiltration and activity of immune cells activated by ICIs, resulting in a more robust antitumor response. Clinical studies have demonstrated promising results with combinations of HDACis, such as entinostat, with ICIs like nivolumab and ipilimumab, particularly in challenging cancer types like advanced HER2-negative breast cancer and melanoma. These combinations not only improved response rates but also indicated enhanced survival outcomes. Preclinical studies further support the synergistic effects of HDACis with ICIs, showing eradication of primary tumors, reduction of metastases, and significant modulation of immune-suppressive cells. Given these findings, integrating HDACis into DDI regimens could offer a powerful strategy for enhancing antitumor immunity and improving clinical outcomes in cancer therapy. Potential challenges for conducting related study These studies demonstrate that pretreatment with HDACis combined with dual ICI therapy is a safe and promising strategy for advanced cancer, warranting further clinical evaluation. However, whether the addition of HDACis will increase the incidence of irAEs in DDI therapy remains unexplored. Additionally, significant research efforts will undoubtedly be required to determine factors such as patient selection for HDACis, dosage, and timing of administration, both in laboratory and clinical studies. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAis) CAis are a class of drugs that inhibit the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is responsible for converting carbon dioxide and water into bicarbonate and protons [ 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 273 279 280 Potential for applying CAi as the third agent in DDI The initiation of Carbonic anhydrase XII inhibitors (CAXIIis) in cancer treatment has shown encouraging early results. A phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02215850 281 282 Acetazolamide, a broad-spectrum carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is being evaluated in combination with radiochemotherapy for lung cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03467360 NCT03011671 273 OBX-115, an engineered TIL therapy, is currently under evaluation in a Phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05470283 283 Immunotherapy targeting CAIX with CAR-T cells is also gaining attention. A clinical trial with 12 patients with CAIX-expressing metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with CAR T cells against CAIX showed that low-dose CAR T cells induced antigen-specific liver toxicity due to CAIX expression on bile duct epithelium. However, pretreatment with a CAIX monoclonal antibody (mAb) reduced this liver toxicity and enhanced CAR T cell persistence. Although no clinical responses were recorded, the study demonstrated the antigen-specific effects of CAIX-targeted CAR T cells and showed that “on-target” toxicity could be mitigated with antigen blockade [ 284 Further exploration in this area includes a Phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04969354 285 Additionally, CAIX-targeted immune therapies, such as autologous DCs transduced with a granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor/CAIX fusion construct (DC-AdGMCAIX), have shown a CAIX-specific immune response in Phase I trials for renal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01826877 286 9 Potential mechanisms of applying CAXIIi as the 3rd agent for DDI Therapeutically targeting Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) in hypoxic solid tumors with the small-molecule inhibitor SLC-0111 has shown significant inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in preclinical models of breast and brain cancer [ 287 289 A recent study showed that combining CAIX inhibitors (CAXIIis) with anti–PD-1 antibodies enhanced therapeutic efficacy in HCC models. This combination therapy significantly attenuated tumor growth, reduced metastasis, and improved OS in vivo. CAXIIis facilitated macrophage adaptation to the acidic tumor environment and promoted the production of CCL8 by macrophages, which in turn enhanced cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. Additionally, CAXIIis increased macrophage apoptosis and reduced their proportion in CD45 + 290 280 291 292 In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), studies have shown that chemotherapeutic agents targeting CAIX, such as SLC-0111, significantly increased extracellular pH while decreasing intracellular pH and extracellular lactate. This shift created a hostile tumor microenvironment that inhibited TNBC progression and sensitized tumors to ICB, enhancing immune cell-mediated killing. These effects were associated with a stronger Th1 response and reduced metastasis, particularly in metastatic melanoma and basal-like breast cancer [ 279 293 + + 294 295 296 297 294 298 A study explored the use of an OVs armed with decorin (OAV-Decorin) in combination with CAIX-targeting CAR-T cells for renal cancer treatment. This combination therapy effectively inhibited renal cancer cell growth and demonstrated enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to either treatment alone in vivo. The improved outcomes were attributed to the therapy’s ability to reduce collagen distribution in the extracellular matrix (ECM), inhibit TGF-β signaling, and increase INF-γ levels, collectively promoting a more favorable tumor microenvironment for CAR-T cell activity [ 299 Potential for applying CAi as the third agent in DDI The application of CAIs as a third agent in DDI holds significant potential due to their unique ability to modify the tumor microenvironment, particularly under hypoxic conditions, which is common in many solid tumors. By targeting enzymes like CAIX and CAXII, CAIs help disrupt the acidic environment that often shields tumors from immune surveillance and limits the efficacy of immune therapies [ 300 301 300 302 303 The positive outlook for applying CAIs in DDI also lies in their capacity to offer a multi-faceted approach. They not only directly alter the tumor environment but also synergize with other therapies, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms that tumors develop against ICIs [ 304 273 Potential challenges for conducting related study Incorporating carbonic CAIs as a third agent in dual immunotherapy presents several significant challenges that must be overcome for successful integration into cancer treatment. One major issue is the substantial variability in carbonic anhydrase expression across different tumor types, making it difficult to predict which patients will benefit from CAI-based therapies [ 305 306 307 308 45 In summary, while CAis offer a novel approach to enhancing immunotherapy, significant research and clinical investigation are required to address tumor heterogeneity, resistance mechanisms, and the potential for toxicity in combination therapies. These efforts will shape the future of personalized, more effective cancer treatment. While novel third-agent sensitizers such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen inhibitors (PCNAis) and carbonic anhydrase IX inhibitors (CAis) demonstrate immunomodulatory potential, their efficacy as monotherapies remains limited, underscoring their optimal use as combination enhancers rather than standalone therapeutics. For PCNAis, preclinical studies—such as those using the novel mAb 14–25-9 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma PDX models—have shown modest tumor growth inhibition (< 30%) as monotherapy, compared to > 70% when combined with NK cell-based therapies. Mechanistically, PCNAis function by disrupting the NKp44-PCNA immune checkpoint and interfering with DNA repair, thereby enhancing the cytotoxic activity of T and NK cells. Similarly, CAis like SLC-0111 have shown minimal survival benefit (< 20% median extension) as monotherapy in murine melanoma and breast cancer models, whereas their combination with ICIs has led to over 60% improvement in survival. The immunologic benefit of CAis stems from reconditioning the hypoxic, acidic tumor microenvironment, facilitating T cell infiltration and reducing MDSC-mediated suppression. Clinical trials have reported low response rates for PCNAis (10–25%) and CAis (< 15%) as monotherapies, often with transient benefits and resistance. These findings support their use in DDI + 1 strategies, where they can complement immune checkpoint blockade, TIL, or CAR-T therapies.

Individual patient outcomes may vary, and ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of these therapeutic approaches Other potential candidates: miroRNA, complementary and alternative medicine Non-coding RNAs Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNA molecules that are transcribed from the genome and do not code for proteins. In addition to their roles at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, they play important roles in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression [ 309 310 311 312 NCT01676259 313 314 Current clinical trials of ncRNAs plus immunotherapy Although there are no clinical trials on the combination of ncRNAs and dual immunotherapy, research on the use of RNAs in conjunction with immunotherapy has shown significant promise. In a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05727839 315 NCT04105335 NCT05097911 Potential mechanisms of applying ncRNAs as the 3rd agent for DDI Previous studies have shown that RNAs can play an anti-tumor role through immune microenvironment and immune checkpoint regulation [ 313 314 316 317 314 318 318 NCT04105335 NCT05097911 Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) CAM encompasses a variety of medical systems and practices that exist alongside, and complement, conventional clinical medicine [ 319 320 321 322 323 Management of irAEs A significant challenge in DDI implementation is the increased incidence and severity of irAEs when multiple immunotherapeutic agents are combined. Specific CAM approaches have demonstrated efficacy in managing these toxicities without compromising anti-tumor immunity. For instance, acupuncture has shown remarkable effectiveness in treating ICI-induced Guillain-Barré syndrome resistant to conventional treatments like intravenous gamma globulin [ 324 325 Overcoming resistance mechanisms A major limitation of current DDI approaches is the development of primary and acquired resistance. Certain bioactive compounds from CAM show promise in targeting resistance pathways. Curcumin specifically targets STAT3 and PD-L1 pathways [ 326 + 327 328 Modulation of tumor microenvironment The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remains a significant barrier to effective DDI therapy. Specific CAM approaches demonstrate unique abilities to reprogram this environment. Plant-derived polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea have been shown to inhibit tumor-associated macrophage polarization toward the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype while promoting dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation [ 329 270 330 Enhancement of therapeutic efficacy through dietary interventions Nutritional approaches offer significant potential to enhance DDI outcomes. The Mediterranean Diet has demonstrated remarkable clinical benefits in patients receiving immunotherapy, with studies showing a 77% higher likelihood of objective response and 74% probability of 12-month progression-free survival in melanoma patients adhering to this dietary pattern [ 331 332 333 334 Improvement of patient quality of life and treatment adherence The complicated administration schedules and cumulative toxicities of DDI regimens often lead to treatment discontinuation. Mind–body interventions including meditation, yoga, and tai chi have been shown to reduce cancer-related fatigue, improve sleep quality, and decrease anxiety in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy [ 19 335 The integration of these CAM approaches into DDI protocols presents a novel opportunity to address key limitations while potentially enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Future clinical trials specifically evaluating CAM components as adjuncts to DDI strategies are warranted to establish standardized protocols that maximize patient benefit. Neutralizing tumor acidity Acidic TMEs, primarily resulting from increased glycolysis (the Warburg effect), lactate accumulation, and carbonic anhydrase overexpression, pose a substantial barrier to effective antitumor immunity by suppressing T cell activation, promoting Treg expansion, impairing DC function, and inducing M2 polarization in tumor-associated macrophages [ 336 337 338 339 340 Triple immunotherapy strategies in cancer treatment The emerging field of triple immunotherapy strategies represents a natural evolution and expansion of the DDI concept, offering even more comprehensive approaches to overcome resistance mechanisms and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Recent groundbreaking studies have demonstrated that strategic combinations of three distinct immunotherapeutic modalities can achieve synergistic effects that surpass dual combinations, particularly in traditionally resistant cancers. For instance, a study showed that combining CD40 agonists with PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade reprograms non-immunogenic tumor microenvironments, enhancing T-cell priming and effector functions [ 341 342 343 Beyond checkpoint blockade, triplet strategies that integrate immunotherapy with targeted therapies and chemotherapy are under active investigation. Trials such as pembrolizumab + trastuzumab + chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer and atezolizumab + bevacizumab + chemotherapy in solid tumors harness the immunomodulatory effects of cytotoxic agents alongside immune checkpoint inhibition [ 344 345 346 As triple immunotherapy transitions from preclinical promise to clinical application, key considerations include optimal patient selection, safety management, and regulatory coordination. Biomarker-driven stratification—based on immune profiling and tumor characteristics—will be essential for identifying responders and minimizing toxicity. While enhanced efficacy is encouraging, triple regimens pose increased risks of irAEs, necessitating refined dosing schedules, sequential administration strategies, and vigilant monitoring. Integration into the existing DDI framework is exemplified by the concept of triple distinct immunotherapy, which expands upon successful dual combinations by introducing synergistic third agents. With continued innovation and careful clinical translation, triple immunotherapy holds transformative potential for improving outcomes in resistant and aggressive cancers. Conclusion Here, this review is the first to bring about the concept of DDI and underscores the unparalleled potential of DDI in redefining systemic cancer treatment. DDI exhibits advantages over existing therapies by synergistically enhancing immune responses through diverse mechanisms, potentially addressing critical challenges such as therapeutic resistance and limited efficacy of monotherapies. Among its most transformative features is its superior ability to convert \"cold tumors\"—characterized by low immune cell infiltration and poor responsiveness to immunotherapy—into \"hot tumors,\" fostering an immunologically active microenvironment. This capability broadens the scope of immunotherapy to include a wider range of cancer types and patient populations, thereby overcoming major barriers in current oncology. The value of DDI lies in its integration of complementary immunotherapeutic modalities, creating a robust and adaptive immune system response. By engaging multiple pathways, DDI not only enhances tumor recognition and elimination but also contributes to long-lasting immune memory, reducing recurrence rates. Clinically, DDI offers a groundbreaking approach to personalizing cancer therapy, with promising applications in combination with cutting-edge strategies such as OVs, CAR-T cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and neoantigen cancer vaccines. Moreover, the transformative potential of DDI extends beyond improving survival outcomes; it represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. By leveraging its ability to reshape the tumor microenvironment and surmount resistance mechanisms, DDI holds the promise of achieving durable responses in even the most challenging cases. Future research and clinical applications of DDI are poised to revolutionize oncology, offering hope for improved quality of life and survival for cancer patients worldwide (Fig. 10 Fig. 10 Level of Evidence in DDI Development: This bar chart illustrates the research progress of different DDI strategies. Among them, the combination of OVs and RNA-based cancer vaccines is progressing relatively slowly, remaining at the animal experiment stage. Additionally, it is worth noting that no Dual Immunotherapy has been approved by the US FDA to date Additionally, as an emerging field, DDI offers vast potential for exploration. Particularly in the selection of the third agent. Incorporating a third agent into DDI presents a significant opportunity to enhance its therapeutic effectiveness by tackling resistance mechanisms, expanding tumor responsiveness, and achieving synergistic effects through multi-faceted approaches. Resistance, often driven by immune checkpoint exhaustion or adaptations within the tumor microenvironment, can potentially be mitigated by introducing complementary agents such as TKIs, anti-angiogenic drugs, or vaccines that target alternative pathways. This strategy may also broaden the scope of DDI, making it effective against less immunogenic “cold tumors” by enhancing immune cell recruitment and improving antigen presentation. Clinically, the inclusion of a third agent has demonstrated the potential to further improve key outcomes, including ORR, PFS, and OS, while reducing relapse rates and achieving more durable treatment responses. Additionally, this approach enables personalized treatment plans tailored to specific tumor biomarkers and individual patient characteristics. Future research should prioritize optimizing the sequencing, timing, and dosing of third agents in DDI regimens, exploring novel immune or metabolic pathways, and extending these strategies to resistant cancers such as pancreatic, ovarian, and urothelial cancers. Efforts to enhance affordability and streamline production processes, particularly for cell- and vaccine-based therapies, will also be essential for broad clinical adoption. Integrating a third agent into DDI represents a promising advancement in cancer treatment, offering a pathway to overcome current limitations, address resistance, and improve long-term patient outcomes. Notably, while none of the DDI strategies or “DDI + 1” approaches summarized and analyzed in this work have yet received FDA approval, the field has already amassed a substantial body of preclinical studies and ongoing clinical trials. Therefore, this area undoubtedly warrants greater effort and attention moving forward. In other word, building upon the significant progress outlined, it is clear that DDI regimens hold immense transformative potential in cancer treatment. By effectively combining distinct immunotherapeutic strategies, DDI has demonstrated the ability to broaden the range of treatable cancers, address resistance mechanisms, and improve treatment outcomes in both preclinical and clinical studies. While the field is still in its early stages, the substantial body of preclinical research and ongoing clinical trials underscores the importance of continued exploration in this area. The integration of a third agent into DDI not only enhances therapeutic efficacy but also represents a strategic approach to overcoming resistance and expanding the application of immunotherapy to less responsive cancers. Future research should focus on optimizing combination strategies, exploring novel therapeutic targets, and addressing challenges such as patient selection, treatment sequencing, and potential side effects. The clinical and scientific significance of this work lies in its potential to provide long-term solutions for challenging cancers, improving survival rates and quality of life for patients worldwide. As a rapidly evolving field, DDI demands greater attention and investment to realize its full potential. By encouraging collaboration across disciplines and advancing innovative research, the future of oncology may see a paradigm shift, where DDI becomes a cornerstone of cancer treatment. This work contributes to laying a strong foundation for future advancements in DDI, inspiring further breakthroughs in the fight against cancer.
