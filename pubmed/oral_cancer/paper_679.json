The development of efficient liposomal encapsulations of proteins for pharmaceutical applications is limited by several factors: their high molecular weight, interactions with surrounding substances, or the generally lower stability compared to small molecules. In this work, various liposomal formulations were prepared using the thin-film hydration method followed by extrusion, to investigate their suitability for the encapsulation of the plant-derived antitumoral mistletoe lectin-1 (ML-1). This can be significantly optimized by exploiting its preferential binding to galactose-containing structures, such as modified lipids integrated into the liposomal bilayer. Incorporation of the galactosylated lipid DSPE-PEG2k-Gal into the membrane significantly enhanced the overall recovery rate and encapsulation efficiency of ML-1, attributed to its affinity for the functionalized component. Compared to non-functionalized liposomes, a 2-fold to 4-fold increase in percentage encapsulation efficiency was observed. The galactosylated lipid optimized the ratio of encapsulated to surface-adsorbed ML-1 and facilitated its preferential localization within the core of the liposomes. A strong correlation was identified between the number of entrapped ML-1 molecules per liposome and the degree of galactosylation. The formulations demonstrated high in vitro cytotoxicity, as exemplified with murine colon-26 carcinoma cells, with the galactose-functionalized liposomes achieving an IC 50 Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Highlights • Optimized liposomal formulation achieved for a high molar weight antitumoral lectin. • Galactosylated lipids are proven to enable affinity-mediated lectin encapsulation. • Galactosylation increases encapsulation efficiency 2-fold to 4-fold. • Lectin used as drug can be localized within the liposomal core. • Cytotoxic activity of affinity-bound lectin is equal to dissolved lectin.

Affinity binding of ML-1 to the liposomal surface was studied in parallel with respect to overexpressed tumor cell surface structures. This liposomal formulation was tested regarding the release of ML-1 from the affinity to galactosylated components at the inside and outside of the liposomal membrane. For this aim, the drug's high cytotoxic activity was tested, thereby optimizing its therapeutic potential for effective CRC treatment. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Material The phospholipids 1,2-Dimyristoyl- sn sn sn 2.2 Preparation of liposomes The different liposomal formulations were prepared using the thin-film hydration method followed by extrusion. Stock solutions of the lipids DMPC, cholesterol, PEG2k and PEG2k-Gal were prepared in ethanol and mixed in a round-bottom flask in ratios corresponding to the desired liposomal compositions ( Table 1 c ML − 1 = c Lipid Table 1 Compositions of the liposomal samples.

Galactose standards were replaced by the galactosylated lipid PEG2k-Gal to generate an adjusted calibration curve. To assess the distribution of PEG2k-Gal within the liposomal bilayer, measurements were first taken of the intact liposomes to determine the outer concentration. To evaluate the galactose content within the inner part of the liposomes, the samples were first disrupted with 5 % ( v P out / P in 2.5 Quantification of ML-1 Quantification of ML-1 in the final samples was performed using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
