Additionally, malformative and connective tissue abnormalities, such as retained primary teeth, joint hyperextensibility and facial dysmorphism, are distinctive manifestations of this condition ( 5 STAT3 6 7 STAT3 8 + 9 10 Several patients with autosomal recessive Hyper-IgE Syndrome (AR-HIES), carrying mutations in the DOCK8 11 12 Staphylococcus 13 12 14 15 16 17 18 19 In this study, we investigated the immunogenetic characteristics of three WASp deficient patients and explored the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway as a potential underlying mechanism for the overlap between WAS and HIES. 2 Methods 2.1 Flow cytometric experiments 2.1.1 Phenotypic analysis For lymphocyte phenotyping, standard flow cytometric methods were used. Cells were incubated with various combinations of labeled monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD19, anti-CD16/56, anti-CD45RA, anti-CXCR5, anti-IgD, anti-CD27) (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes in the dark at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed once with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) 0.3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 8 min at +4 °C, fixed with 300 µl of PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. 2.1.2 Intracellular WASp expression analysis Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized venous blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized and stained with either anti-WASp or isotype control antibody, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody. After surface staining with anti-CD3 antibody, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. The detailed protocol is provided in the  Supplementary Materials 2.1.3 STAT3 phosphorylation analysis STAT3 phosphorylation was analyzed as previously described ( 20 All flow cytometric analyses were recorded on a BD FACS CantoTM II (BD Life Sciences) and the data were processed with Diva (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) and FlowJo softwares. 2.2 Proliferation assays PBMCs were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 7%AB serum and incubated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (5μg/ml) or anti-CD3 for 3 days and with specific antigens (tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD; 20μg/ml)) for 5 days at 37 °C/5% CO2. In vitro 2.3 Genetic analysis Genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA-peripheral blood samples using the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The 12 exons of WAS  Supplementary Materials 2.4 Real-time PCR analysis of SOCS3  Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) –ΔCT 2.5 Western blot analysis of DOCK8 expression Western blot for DOCK8 protein expression was performed on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs) derived from a WAS patient and a healthy control. Briefly, proteins were extracted and quantified using Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay, then separated by electrophoresis and transferred on to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were probed with either a monoclonal anti-DOCK8 or anti-β-actin antibody, followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). The detailed protocol is provided in the  Supplementary Materials 3 Results 3.1 Case description and preliminary immunological investigation Three patients belonging to 3 unrelated families and presenting with a clinical presentation suggestive of WAS, were investigated. P1 was born at 35 weeks of gestation to third-degree consanguineous parents, with no notable family history. During the neonatal period, thrombocytopenia and anemia were identified, along with a positive anti-platelet antibodies. At seven months of age, he developed eczema and persistent thrombocytopenia without bleeding or recurrent infections. Repeated blood cell counts consistently showed a low mean platelet volume (MPV) (<5 fL) and a peripheral blood smear confirmed the presence of small platelets, raising suspicion of WAS and prompting referral for specialized care. No neurological, pleuropulmonary or cardiovascular impairments were observed, and there were no signs of cutaneous or mucosal bleeding, tumor syndrome or palpable lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow smear analysis revealed a polymorphic marrow with well-represented cell lineages. The granulocytic lineage was present at all maturation stages with a distinct eosinophilic component. Immunological evaluation showed eosinophilia, basophilia and hypogammaglobulinemia with low IgG and IgM. Serum IgE levels were not assessed. Lymphocyte phenotyping revealed decreased total memory and non-switched memory B-cells and elevated NK-cell levels. Proliferation in response to anti-CD3 stimulation was impaired. The patient was managed with regular intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions and antibiotic prophylaxis. At the age of 8 years, a trauma induced severe epistaxis episode requiring platelet transfusion and immunoglobulin therapy. His follow-up at age 11 years showed a favorable outcome with no severe infections and only mild bleeding episodes not requiring specific treatment. Currently, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has not been considered due to the absence of a geno-identical donor and the relatively mild severity of his clinical presentation. P2, a full-term male infant born to non-consanguineous parents, presented at 7 days of age with omphalitis. Initial evaluation revealed atopic dermatitis localized to the forehead with dry skin, thrombocytopenia with reduced MPV but no bleeding and regenerative hemolytic anemia with a negative direct Coombs test. At 2 months, he developed localized BCGitis. Peripheral blood smear confirmed the presence of small platelets and bone marrow analysis was unremarkable. Immunological workup showed slightly increased IgE, basophilia, lymphopenia and persistent thrombocytopenia. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping revealed reduced CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, naïve CD4+ T cells and CXCR5+ memory helper T cells with increased NK cells. Proliferation responses to mitogens and specific antigens were normal. The patient had persistent thrombocytopenia with recurrent severe bleeding (rectal bleeding, hematuria, and cutaneous hemorrhages) despite regular IVIG therapy and platelet transfusions. At the age of five years, he developed facial herpes zoster (resolved with acyclovir) followed by recurrent herpes labialis with gingivitis starting at age 10. On the latest follow-up, his skin remained dry with eczematous lesions. Given the high risk of life-threatening bleeding and a disease severity score of 4 (thrombocytopenia, eczema, immunodeficiency and autoimmunity), he is currently being evaluated for a haploidentical bone marrow transplant from his father. Treatment with eltrombopag is also under consideration to reduce the bleeding risk. P3 was born to non-consanguineous parents without an apparent family history. Clinical manifestations started at 48 hours of life and were marked by bruising and petechial purpura. A complete blood cell count revealed isolated thrombocytopenia. He experienced multiple hospitalizations, starting at 3 months for persistent thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion. At 7 months, he was admitted again for thrombocytopenia, poorly tolerated anemia, and generalized eczema. By 16 months, he developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) with a positive IgG direct Coombs test, with ongoing thrombocytopenia. Laboratory investigations revealed small platelets with a MPV of 4.9 fL. Bone marrow biopsy results were consistent with peripheral thrombocytopenia. Antinuclear antibody testing was positive with a speckled pattern. Immunoglobulin profiling revealed reduced IgM, increased IgA and markedly elevated IgE levels. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping showed decreased CD8+ T cells, naïve CD4+ T cells, total memory and non-switched memory B-cells as well as CXCR5+ memory helper T cells. NK cells were elevated. Proliferation responses were impaired to anti-CD3 stimulation. The patient was managed with antibiotic prophylaxis, monthly IVIG infusions, corticosteroid therapy for AIHA and topical corticosteroids for eczema. At 2 years and 7 months, the patient developed candidemia, which was successfully treated with systemic antifungal therapy over one month. At 3 years of follow-up, the patient remained free of bleeding episodes. Given the severity of his clinical phenotype and the absence of a geno-identical donor, a haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant is currently under consideration for this patient. Based on clinical presentation and initial investigations, P1 was diagnosed with X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) with a severity score of 2, while P2 and P3 exhibited classic WAS with a score of 4 and 5 respectively. The detailed immunological phenotype is summarized in  Table 1 Table 1 Clinical and immunogenetic features of WAS patients.

Flow cytometry analysis of intracellular WASp expression confirmed the diagnosis, revealing a complete absence of WASp in P1 and P3, while P2 exhibited reduced WASp level compared to healthy controls (  Figure 1 Figure 1 Flow cytometry analysis of intracellular WASp expression. (A) + (B) + (C) + Panel A shows flow cytometry histograms comparing WASp expression in CD3+ T cells from a control and three patients (P1, P2, P3) with specific genetic mutations. The control shows 74% WASp positivity, while P1 and P3 show 0%, and P2 shows 32%. Panel B is a scatter plot depicting percentages of WASp in CD3+ T cells, with a red dashed line at 60.75%. Panel C is a line graph showing WASp mean fluorescence intensity in CD3+ T cells, with control cells having higher intensity compared to P1, P2, and P3. Sanger sequencing of the WAS gene revealed three distinct hemizygous mutations (  Figure 2A  Figure 2B  Figure 2A Figure 2 Molecular analysis of WAS (A) WAS (B) WAS Panel A shows DNA sequencing chromatograms comparing wild-type and variant sequences for controls and individuals with mutations P1, P2, and P3.

Panel B displays a schematic of the WAS gene with exons labeled and mutations indicated by arrows: c.167C>T, c.360+1G>T, and c.734+1G>C. Key protein domains, such as EVH1, BR, GBD, PPP, VH, CH, and AR, are annotated. Then, in order to investigate the underlying mechanism for the shared features between WAS and HIES, we studied the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. All WAS deficient patients showed a complete absence of STAT3 phosphorylation in T cells following IL-6 stimulation whereas, healthy controls showed normal phosphorylation (  Figures 3A–C SOCS3 21 p value:0.0039  Figure 3D Figure 3 IL-6/STAT3 pathway analysis in WASp deficient T cells.

Panel A: Flow cytometry histograms showing STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 in CD3+ T cells from WAS patients (P1, P2, P3) and a healthy control; blue = unstimulated PBMCs, red = IL-6–stimulated PBMCs. Panel B: Scatter plot of the percentage of pY705-STAT3–positive CD3+ T cells in patients versus controls, with threshold set at the 5th percentile of controls. Panel C: Mean fluorescence intensity of pY705-STAT3. Panel D: SOCS3 mRNA levels in IL-6–stimulated PBMCs from P2 and three healthy controls, normalized to β-actin. Panel E: Immunoblot of DOCK8 in B-LCLs from P2 and a control, showing comparable expression. To determine whether the STAT3 phosphorylation defect resulted from impaired DOCK8 secondary to the WASP defect, we examined DOCK8 expression in B-LCLs derived from P2, the only patient for whom these cells were available at the time of analysis, and a healthy control. DOCK8 protein levels were comparable between patient and control B-LCLs (  Figure 3E 4 Discussion WAS is a rare X-linked IEI first described by Alfred Wiskott in 1937 ( 22 2 WAS Standard immunological investigations revealed eosinophilia in P1 and elevated IgE levels in P2 and P3. Increased eosinophil counts and elevated IgE levels have been frequently observed in WAS patients ( 23 24 3 Lymphocyte phenotyping revealed a decrease in CD3+ (P2), CD4+ (P2) CD8+ (P2, P3) as well as in non-switched memory B cells (P1, P3) and CXCR5 + + + 25 + + 26 27 28 29 Since the discovery of the WAS 1 WAS 30 31 31 30 32 33 34 35 30 33 36 37 38 39 Given the shared features between WAS and HIES, particularly those caused by STAT3 and DOCK8 deficiencies, we investigated IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway in T cells of WAS patients to unravel a potential common mechanism. Indeed, WAS and HIES are distinct IEIs that exhibit overlapping phenotype, including recurrent infections, eczema, eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels. Interestingly, despite their clinical and molecular heterogeneity, the three included patients exhibited impaired STAT3 phosphorylation in T cells following IL-6 stimulation. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR analysis of IL-6 stimulated PBMCs from P2 revealed a significant reduction in SOCS3 transcript levels compared to healthy controls. These results, although limited to a small number of WAS-deficient patients, need to be further validated in a larger number of patients as well as on WAS knockout T cell lines. Moreover, the impaired IL-6/STAT3 signaling appears to be independent of DOCK8 expression, as demonstrated in LCLs from P2, which exhibited normal DOCK8 levels. However, this conclusion is based on data from a single patient and limited to protein expression. Further investigations are required to substantiate this hypothesis. Impaired IL-6/STAT3 signaling in WAS T cells is likely to have broad functional consequences. IL-6 plays a central role in the differentiation of Tfh cells through STAT3-dependent induction of BCL-6, the master regulator of the Tfh program ( 40 41 9 42 + 10 43 44 + 44 43 Previous studies have highlighted the role of the WASp-WIP-DOCK8 complex in T cells, where WIP serves as a critical bridge between DOCK8 and WASp in cytoskeletal remodeling ( 16 19 17  Figure 4 Figure 4 Hypothetical role of the WIP–WASp–DOCK8 complex in IL-6–mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in T cells. DOCK8 has been shown to associate with WASp and WIP to form a molecular complex in T lymphocytes. In this study, we demonstrate that WASp deficiency impairs STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation following IL-6 stimulation in T cells. These findings support a speculative model in which the WIP–WASp–DOCK8 complex contributes to IL-6/STAT3 signaling. The precise mechanism by which the WASP/WIP/DOCK8 complex regulates the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway remains to be elucidated. This figure has been created with BioRender.com Diagram illustrating the signaling pathway involving IL-6 and JAK in WASp deficient T lymphocytes. IL-6 binds to its receptor, activating JAK and leading to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Inactive STAT3 fails to dimerize and translocate to the nucleus due to WASp deficiency, inhibiting transcription activation. The absence of WASp, alongside WIP and DOCK8, disrupts the pathway, preventing active STAT3 dimer formation. In conclusion, our findings add a new piece to the puzzle of the pathophysiology of WAS and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying its shared features with HIES. The identification of defective IL-6/STAT3 phosphorylation in WASp-deficient T cells highlights the complex interplay among different IEI entities that share common signaling pathways and suggests a potential role for WASp in STAT3 regulation. These results underscore the need for further research to delineate the precise molecular mechanisms by which WASp regulates IL-6/STAT3 activation and to determine whether this regulatory interplay extends to other cytokine signaling pathways. Understanding these interactions could pave the way for therapeutic strategies targeting STAT3 dysfunction in WAS patients.
