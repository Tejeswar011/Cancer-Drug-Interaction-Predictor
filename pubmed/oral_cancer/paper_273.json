Oral mucositis (OM) is a common side effect of head and neck radio-chemotherapy. It manifests as painful, ulcerative lesions in the oral mucosa, significantly impairing essential functions such as eating, speaking, and maintaining oral hygiene. It finally has adverse effects on the patient's quality of life. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has emerged as a promising non-invasive modality for preventing and treating OM. Due to controversy among the results of studies, this literature review synthesizes findings from recent randomized controlled trials that evaluated the use of PBMT in adult and pediatric cancer patients. This review also highlights the mechanisms, clinical efficacy, and future challenges of integrating PBMT into routine supportive cancer care. The evidence shows that PBMT significantly reduces the severity and duration of OM, improved patient-reported outcomes, and minimized treatment-related morbidity. By utilizing low-intensity light sources—typically lasers or LEDs—PBMT enhances cellular metabolism, reduces inflammation, alleviates pain, and promotes mucosal healing. Despite its clinical potential, widespread implementation of PBMT is hindered by variability in treatment protocols and limited standardization; in brief, laser protocols — wavelengths (630–980 nm), energy densities (2–6 J/cm 2 Keywords Low-level laser Photobiomodulation Oral mucositis Radio-chemotherapy pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Cancer continues to be a major health problem worldwide, with millions of new cases and deaths reported each year. 1 2 , 3 4 OM is characterized by inflammation, erythema, and ulceration of the mucosal lining within the oral cavity. It is primarily triggered by the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and ionizing radiation on rapidly dividing epithelial cells. 5 , 6 5 7 , 8 9 10 PBMT is a non-invasive and safe technique that involves the application of low-intensity, non-ionizing light sources such as lasers or light-emitting diodes (LEDs). These light waves penetrate tissue without increasing tissue temperature or causing any tissue damage. They are absorbed by intracellular chromophores, particularly within the mitochondria, leading to increased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of transcription factors that promote cell proliferation and migration. 11 12 Different studies have explored the clinical applications of PBMT in treating or preventing OM. However, there is controversy regarding the integration of PBMT into routine clinical practice, which faces several challenges, especially due to various PBMT protocols (including variations in light source, wavelength, energy output, and treatment frequency). 13 Pathophysiology of oral mucositis OM follows a dynamic and multifactorial biological sequence that can be conceptualized in five interrelated stages: initiation, upregulation and message generation, signal amplification, ulceration, and healing. 14 14 , 15 c 16 Clinical evidence on photobiomodulation therapy for oral mucositis Over the past two decades, numerous randomized clinical trials have assessed the effectiveness of PBMT in preventing and treating OM in cancer patients (see Table 1 Table 1 Description of the reviewed studies.

Out of the thirteen trials analyzed, 10 employed PBMT as a preventive measure. 3 , 17 , 19 20 21 , 23 24 25 26 , 28 3 , 19 , 21 , 24 19 18 , 22 , 27 18 , 22 Laser parameters Laser specifications —particularly the wavelength, energy density, and frequency of application— varied significantly among trials and impacted outcomes. Most studies employed red or near-infrared wavelengths ranging from 630 to 980 nm, often using diode, aluminium gallium indium phosphide and helium-neon (He–Ne) sources. Preventive protocols, like those in Gautam et al. and Ahmed et al., used lower energy densities (2–4 J/cm 2 25 , 26 , 28 2 18 2 22 19 Timing and frequency of application Effective PBMT protocols generally started at or before the initiation of chemoradiation and continued at least three to five times per week. For example, Khalil et al. applied a single preconditioning session with 635/980 nm light before chemotherapy and reported a statistically significant delay in OM onset. 17 22 25 , 26 , 28 Target population PBMT has shown utility across age groups. Ahmed et al. and Guimaraes et al. specifically studied pediatric populations receiving high-dose chemotherapy. 21 , 26 21 25 Patient-reported outcomes and quality of life Patient-reported outcomes are critical in evaluating supportive cancer care interventions. Several randomized trials have demonstrated that PBMT significantly improves patient-reported outcomes by reducing pain, improving oral intake, and limiting the need for analgesics. In the study by Khalil et al., patients who received a single preventive PBMT session before chemotherapy reported lower pain levels, reduced mucositis scores, and improved functional parameters like eating and speaking. 17 28 18 21 , 26 Mechanism of photobiomodulation therapy The mechanism of action of PBMT involves a complex sequence of photophysical and photochemical processes that begin at the cellular level and include its local biological effects. 16 Fig. 1 29 Figure 1 Mechanism of photobiomodulation therapy. Figure 1 Primary effect c 29 , 30 Secondary effect 31 , 32 30 Tertiary effect 30 , 32 33 Clinical studies have substantiated these mechanistic layers. For example, Salvador et al. reported significant reductions in salivary IL-8 and nitrite levels following PBMT treatment. 24 20 Safety In this review of 13 randomized clinical trials, PBMT was consistently found to be a safe, painless, and well-tolerated treatment option. No documented adverse events, tissue damage, or complications were associated with laser exposure. Importantly, PBMT did not interfere with the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and no studies reported any evidence of tumor stimulation or negative impacts on oncological outcomes. This safety profile was observed across all age groups, including pediatric patients and elderly populations. 21 , 25 , 26 Future and challenges While the evidence supporting the use of PBMT for preventing and treating OM is encouraging, several challenges persist. A significant issue is the absence of standardized protocols for PBMT, including optimal wavelength, dosage, treatment duration, and frequency of application. Different studies have utilized various light sources and treatment regimens, complicating comparisons of results across the literature. Future research should establish the most effective PBMT parameters for preventing and treating OM. Additionally, further studies could investigate the potential synergistic effects of combining PBMT with other interventions, such as topical treatments or pharmacological agents, to enhance its therapeutic benefits. Conclusion In conclusion, PBMT is a promising, non-invasive method for preventing and treating OM in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, particularly those with HNC. Evidence from randomized clinical trials encompassing both adult and pediatric populations consistently supports the effectiveness of PBMT in reducing the severity of mucositis, accelerating healing, and improving patients' QoL. PBMT achieves these positive outcomes by modulating inflammatory cytokines, enhancing antioxidant defenses, and stimulating tissue repair. Furthermore, patient-reported outcomes confirm its role in improving daily functioning and reducing the need for pain management and treatment delays. However, a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of PBMT is the lack of standardized protocols, particularly concerning wavelength, energy density, treatment duration, and application frequency. Future studies should focus on establishing evidence-based guidelines and exploring the long-term effects of PBMT on cancer treatment outcomes. Given its safety, ease of use, and proven effectiveness, PBMT should be considered a standard supportive care measure for managing treatment-induced mucositis.
