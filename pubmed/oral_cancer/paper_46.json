Here, we used germ-free mice colonized with human donor stool from the United States and Thailand to investigate how person-to-person transmission of gut commensals – via shared air and physical contact – affects U.S. and Thai microbiomes and subsequent health outcomes. We found that both air sharing and physical contact enabled bidirectional transmission: U.S. mucus-degrading taxa (e.g., Akkermansia Akkermansia Lactobacillus Keywords: Immigration gut microbiome food additives non-nutritive sweeteners industrialization microbiome transmission Akkermansia Lactobacillus National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation 10.13039/100014261 DK114007 We are grateful to four study participants for providing sampsles.

First, we examined how shared air and cohousing contributed to changes in gut microbiome composition. We then challenged these humanized mice with 13 dietary components commonly found in industrialized diets – including emulsifiers, preservatives, thickening agents, fluoride, meat, HFCS, and NNS – to assess their impact on microbiome and metabolic phenotypes. Lastly, we examined whether changes in the microbiome driven by shared air and cohousing have an impact on the metabolic outcomes. Together, our findings show how individual-to-individual transmission in shared spaces and industrialized dietary factors intersect to shape gut microbial landscapes. Throughout this manuscript, we use the specific terms, “U.S.” and “Thai” to refer to the two microbiome types being studied, and the general terms “highly industrialized” or “industrialized” and “traditional rural” to describe, broadly, the different types of dietary and environmental exposures typically experienced in the U.S. urban environment and the rural Thai environments from which subjects were recruited. We use the term “industrialization” to refer to the adaptation of microbiomes to exposure to a highly industrialized diet and environment. Results Industrialization of the Thai microbiome is a function of baseline microbial composition and shared environments We conceptualized microbiome changes following shared environmental exposures as secondary succession and hypothesized that baseline microbiome composition governs susceptibility to industrialization. To capture contrasting baseline profiles, we used two donor pairs (dp1 and dp2) differing in age among Thai participants. Donor pair-1 (dp1) included late middle-aged U.S. and Thai donors; donor pair-2 (dp2) consisted of a late middle-aged U.S. donor and a young Thai donor. To assess how shared environments (shared air or spaces) influence the industrialization of Thai microbiomes, we colonized germ-free C57BL/6 mice with stool from U.S. donors or Thai donors. After four weeks of separate housing to establish distinct donor-specific microbial communities, mice from both donor groups were placed in a single vinyl isolator with a shared air supply (SAS), separated by a barrier to prevent direct contact, for 2−4 weeks. To evaluate the effects of direct physical contact, we then co-housed two mice from each group in the same cage for an additional two weeks ( Figure 1A Figure 1. Industrialization of the Thai microbiome is a function of baseline microbial composition and shared environments. (A) Experimental design. Germ-free mice were colonized with fecal samples from U.S. or Thai donors (two donors per group) in separate isolators, each with its own air supply. After 4 weeks, all groups were transferred to a single isolator with a shared air supply (SAS) but remained physically separated. Two donor pairs (dp1 and dp2) were used, each from female donors of normal body mass index (kg/m 2 n n n n n n n n n n n n p Human-to-mouse microbiome engraftment ranged from 65% to 79% across donors, with comparable community profiles between donors and their respective mouse groups (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1A).

To test this, we introduced 13 common industrialized dietary components and additives (Supplementary Table 6) into the drinking water or cage bottoms of mice humanized with U.S. or Thai donors over two-week intervals. These components were categorized into four groups: (1) meats (beef and chicken), (2) fluoride, (3) non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and (4) selected food additives, including emulsifiers, preservatives, and thickening agents. To assess reproducibility, two parallel experiments were conducted, each differing in the order in which dietary components were added ( Figure 2A Figure 2. U.S. and Thai microbiomes respond differently to industrialized dietary ingredients and food additives. (A) Experimental design. 6-week-old, GF mice were humanized with human donor samples of age matched U.S. and Thai human donors. Two parallel experiments (Order A, Order B), differing in the sequence of introducing four highly industrialized dietary ingredients and additives categories – meat, fluoride, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) + non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), and other food additives – were conducted in humanized mice colonized with Thai or U.S. donor microbiomes.

Following humanization, mice were fed either standard chow with industrialized dietary ingredients and additive (IDA, including the 13 dietary components mentioned above) or standard chow alone with tap water (control) for three weeks ( Figure 3A p Figure 3B Akkermansiacea Figure 3C Lactobacillaceae Figure 3.

The IDA group (8−13 mice per donor group; 2 Thai donors and 1 U.S. donor) received regular mouse chow enhanced with dried chicken, beef, as well as food additives (emulsifiers, preservatives, coating and thickening agents), high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, and fluoride added into drinking water while control group (5−13 mice per donor group; 1 Thai donor and 2 U.S. donors) continued regular mouse chow and city water.

Mice humanized with stool from a single Thai and a single U.S. donor underwent the three-week IDA dietary intervention described above, following four weeks of SAS with or without co-housing ( Figure 4A Akkermansia Lactobacillus Figure 4B p Figure 4C, D p Figure 3 p p Figure 4. Microbial transmission via shared air spaces modulates metabolic outcomes in mice colonized with the U.S. microbiome. (A) Experimental design. To explore how shared air supply (SAS) or co-housing influence changes in weight and body composition after IDA, we used mice colonized with dp2 stool samples from Figure 1 n n n Figure 3 Akkermansia Lactobacillus n n n p Consistent with observations from IDA alone, SAS with or without co-housing did not result in differences in oral glucose tolerance among U.S.- and Thai-colonized mice following IDA (Supplementary Figure 4B, C; Tukey HSD, adj. p p Discussion Using humanized mouse models, we demonstrate that shared air and living environments facilitate bidirectional microbial transfer, shaping the composition of microbial communities. Baseline microbial composition appears to be a key factor in this process. Specifically, we observed that the microbiome of age-matched mice colonized with Thai stool shifted considerably toward that of U.S.-colonized mice when sharing an air supply. In contrast, mice colonized with Thai stool that was more similar to the U.S. donor microbiome exhibited only modest changes. Interestingly, we observed a bidirectional transfer of microbes between the U.S.- and Thai-colonized mice. While we anticipated that the transfer of deleterious U.S.-associated microbes might result in adverse metabolic consequences for the Thai-colonized mice, we were surprised to find that microbial transfer through shared air supply instead led to reduced weight gain in the U.S.-colonized mice when fed a diet enriched with industrialized dietary ingredients and additives. This effect may be attributed to the acquisition of Lactobacilli 16 Our study provides a valuable model for investigating the effects of shared environments in a highly controlled setting, allowing us to dissect the roles of shared air space, physical contact, and diet on the gut microbiome and potential metabolic outcomes. However, we acknowledge certain limitations in our approach. First, while we used dietary additive levels based on the recommendations from regulatory bodies, these permissible amounts are lower than those employed in some other studies, which may explain the modest metabolic effects observed. Although microbial transmission was associated with differences in body weight, no significant changes were detected in lean mass or glucose tolerance. We cannot exclude the possibility that these weight effects reflect organ-specific differences, such as cecum enlargement influenced by gut microbiota. Moreover, while our three-week intervention was sufficient to detect body weight changes, it may have been too brief to capture slower metabolic outcomes such as glucose intolerance. Extending the intervention period could provide further insights into the long-term metabolic consequences of these additives. Although we minimized direct contact between donor groups by using physical barriers and disinfecting gloves between handling, the possibility of cross-contamination under shared-air conditions cannot be entirely excluded. Nevertheless, the consistent, donor-specific transmission patterns we observed suggest that any inadvertent exchange was likely minimal. Future studies using customized housing designs may further reduce this risk and provide deeper insights into the role of shared environments on shifts in the microbiome shifts and metabolic outcomes. Conclusion While diet has traditionally been viewed as a key driver of microbiome changes, our findings highlight the significant impact that shared environments can have on microbial transmission and associated metabolic outcomes. The bidirectional transfer of microbes observed between U.S.- and Thai-colonized mice underscores how close living conditions can facilitate microbial exchange. While the prevailing view suggests that the acquisition of U.S.-associated microbes along with loss of potentially beneficial taxa by industrialization often leads to deleterious metabolic consequences, our findings raise a provocative hypothesis: the acquisition of traditional rural microbes may, in some cases, confer beneficial effects on the resident population. Methods Human donor samples Thai donor fecal samples were sourced from our previous human study involving Karen participants residing in Thailand (a refugee camp in Tak Province [Mae La]). 9 2 Figure 1A Mouse husbandry All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number A00002908-17-R23. Mouse experiments were conducted at the Mayo Clinic Gnotobiotic Facility. Care for these mice was provided by specialized gnotobiotic staff, ensuring compliance with established animal husbandry practices and regulatory standards. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle and monitored daily for any signs of stress or altered behavior; humane euthanasia was performed if distress was observed. The GF status was rigorously verified before the experiments began through two consecutive sets of cultures from fecal pellets, feed, and bedding on brain heart infusion (BHI), Sabouraud dextrose, and nutrient media, under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. PCR testing of the 16S rRNA gene in fecal DNA was also performed using universal and Turicibacter 17 C57BL/6J GF mice were housed in open top cages with metal wire lids inside flexible film vinyl isolators (Class Biologically Clean, Madison, WI). Ad lib access to autoclaved diet (Purina Lab diet, 5K67, PMI Nutrition, Shoreview, MN), and autoclaved nanopure water were provided. Weaning occurred at 3–4 weeks of age. Donor fecal suspensions were prepared by mixing previously collected stool (1.5 mL vial) with 3 mL pre-reduced PBS in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI), then vortexed for 1–2 min. GF C57BL/6 mice (4–6 weeks old, both sexes) were fasted overnight and removed from their isolators for oral gavage with 300 µL of the donor suspension. Mice were allowed 4–6 weeks for microbial colonization. Humanized mice (GF mice colonized with human stool) were maintained either in individually ventilated cages (Techniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) or flexible film vinyl isolators based on the experiment type. Mice were housed by cohort (Thai-donor, vs. U.S.-donor) and sex in separate cages. Inside the flexible film vinyl isolators, food, water, and dietary intervention materials were transferred through sterile transfer port caps. While handling mice from American and Thai-donor groups within the same isolator, gloves were thoroughly dipped and rubbed with a disinfectant solution (Oxivir® Tb) between groups to prevent cross-contamination. Physical barriers were placed between cages from different cohorts to further limit contamination. Dietary interventions and food additives In our previous study, we found that U.S. participants consumed greater amounts of milk, white bread rolls, grain-based products (e.g., pasta, bread), carbonated soft drinks, meat, and chicken compared to Thai participants. 9 18–25 Figures 2A, 3A 4A Figures 3A 4A Figure 2A Body mass composition measurements Mice used in metabolic experiments were ear-punched for identification. Body weight was measured before and after the intervention on the same scale, with each mouse from the same donor group placed in a sterile Nalgene cup. Pre- and post-intervention body composition (lean mass, fat mass, free water, and total water) was assessed using an EchoMRI-100 (EchoMRI, Houston, TX) – a high-throughput, non-invasive method based on quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance. Mice were briefly placed in a plastic tube, and measurements were completed within approximately 90 s per animal. Body mass composition measurements consisting of fat mass, lean mass, free water and total water were generated. Oral glucose tolerance test After fasting for 6 h prior to the glucose tolerance test (GGT), animals were weighed, and baseline (0 min) glucose was measured. A glucose solution [2 g D-(+)-Glucose dissolved in 10 mL nanopure water] was administered by oral gavage at 1 g/kg. Blood glucose levels were measured at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-gavage using a CONTOUR® NEXT EZ glucometer. Tail-prick blood samples were obtained with a 25 G needle at the tail tip or via tail nick; subsequent samples were collected by gently massaging the tail. The final measurement (120 min) served as the study endpoint, followed by animal euthanasia. Sample collection Fecal pellets were collected from cages stratified by human donor, intervention group, and sex. One pellet per mouse sampled at each time point for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing. All samples were stored at −80 °C for subsequent microbiome profiling. Microbial DNA extraction and sequencing Pellet samples were shipped to the University of Minnesota Genomics Center for further processing. DNA was extracted from each sample using Qiagen's DNeasy 96 PowerSoil Pro QIAcube HT Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with primers adapted from 515F/806R, incorporating Illumina adaptor overhangs, and sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq System (2 × 300 bp). Sequencing primers (forward: GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA; reverse: GACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) were removed from all reads using Atropos 26 27 , 28 29 Microbial data analysis Duplicate samples and one sample with low read count (<1000) were filtered prior to analysis.
