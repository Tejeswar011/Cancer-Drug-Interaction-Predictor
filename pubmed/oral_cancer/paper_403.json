In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether anlotinib reverses osimertinib resistance by inhibiting the formation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. In a clinical case, anlotinib reversed osimertinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analyses on tumor tissues from three NSCLC patients with osimertinib resistance to analyze alterations in the expression levels of EMT markers and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) before and after the development of osimertinib resistance. The results revealed the downregulation of E-cadherin, coupled with the upregulation of vimentin and VEGFA in tumor tissues of patients exhibiting osimertinib resistance, compared with those in tissues from patients before receiving osimertinib. Subsequently, we established osimertinib-resistant (Osi-R) cell lines and found that the Osi-R cells acquired EMT features. Next, we analyzed the synergistic effects of the combination therapy to verify whether anlotinib could reverse osimertinib resistance by inhibiting EMT. The expression levels of VEGFA and tube formation were analyzed in the combination group in vitro in vivo non-small cell lung cancer osimertinib anlotinib resistance epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 82172728 and 82370096). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which exhibits a high incidence rate, poses a serious threat to human health [ 1 [ 2 [ 3 EGFR ALK KRAS MET ROS1 NTRK RET [ 4 EGFR [ 5 e.g. C797X [ 6 [ 5 7 [ 8 EMT, recognized as a driving force behind tumor progression, leads to both innate and acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment [ 9 [ 10 [ 7 [ 5 [ 10 [ 11 12 vs. P [ 13 Recently, clinical observations have indicated that the addition of anlotinib provides clinical benefits to patients who have become resistant to osimertinib [ 14 Materials and methods Cell lines PC9 and HCC827 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The EGFR EGFR 2 50 Western blotting assay The treated cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Cat. #P0013B, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat. #4693116001, Roche, Switzerland). The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.45-μm membranes (Cat. #IPVH00010, Millipore, Merck, Germany). The membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against E-cadherin (1∶1000, Cat. #3195, Cell Signaling Technology [CST], Danvers, MA, USA), N-cadherin (1∶1000, Cat. #22018-1-AP, Proteintech, Wuhan, Hubei, China), vimentin (1∶1000, Cat. #5741, CST), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA; 1∶1000, Cat. #19003-1-AP, Proteintech), p-Akt (1∶1000, Cat. #4060, CST), and Akt (1∶1000, Cat. #9272, CST), and β-actin (1∶5000, Cat. #66009-1-Ig, Proteintech). The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Cat. #7074 and #7076, CST), followed by exposure to a horseradish peroxidase-based luminescent solution (Cat. #WBKLS0500, Millipore). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) A human VEGFA ELISA kit (Cat. #FMS-ELH-046, FCMACS, Nanjing, China) was used to determine the VEGFA levels in the cell culture supernatants of HCC827-Osi-R (HCC827-OR) cells. The supernatant was collected, and the cell fragments were removed by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min. It was stored at −80 ℃ for subsequent experiments, following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) The total RNA from treated cells was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Cat. #R401-01, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a transcription kit (Cat. #R323-01, Vazyme) following the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, the qRT-PCR assay was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Cat. #Q411-02, Vazyme). The relative expression levels of the target genes were analyzed using the 2 −∆∆Ct VEGFA ' ' VEGFA ' ' GAPDH ' ' GAPDH ' ' Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay PC9, HCC827, PC9-Osi-R (PC9-OR), and HCC827-OR cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3 000–5 000 cells/well. The next day, the cells were cultured with varying concentrations of osimertinib and anlotinib (a generous gift from Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). After 48 h of incubation, the cells were incubated with a culture medium containing MTT for 2–4 h. Subsequently, formazan was dissolved using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Finally, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm, and the IC 50 Colony formation assay PC9, HCC827, PC9-OR, and HCC827-OR cells in the log phase were seeded into six-well plates at a density of 1 000 cells/well. The next day, the cells were cultured with a medium containing osimertinib and anlotinib if required for 10–14 days. Upon the formation of colonies containing more than 50 cells, the cells were fixed with methanol for 15 min, stained with Giemsa (Cat. #C0131, Beyotime) for 45 min, and visualized under a microscope. Wound-healing assay The treated PC9, HCC827, PC9-OR, and HCC827-OR cells were seeded in 6-well plates. A 100-μL pipette tip was used to scratch the cell monolayer when the cells grew to around 80% confluence. In the wound-healing assay, the scratches were recorded at 0 h and 24 h by using a microscope, and the wound healing conditions were analyzed after 24 h of culture. Transwell assay The PC9, HCC827, PC9-OR, and HCC827-OR cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded in the Transwell chamber (Cat. #3422, Corning, New York, USA) at a density of 5 × 10 4 Tube formation assay A total of 50 μL precooled Matrigel (Cat. #356234, Corning, USA) was added to 96-well plates and incubated at 37 ℃ for 30 min. The supernatant of the indicated cells was then extracted, and a mixture of the supernatant and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at a density of 1.5 × 10 4 Immunofluorescence staining The treated cells (PC9, PC9-OR, HCC827, and HCC827-OR) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100. Then, the cells were blocked and incubated overnight at 4 ℃ with the indicated primary antibodies. On the next day, the cells were incubated with fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated Affinipure Goat anti-Rabbit IgG antibody (1∶200, Cat. #SA00003-2, Proteintech) at 37 ℃ for 1 h and counterstained with DAPI (Cat. #C1006, Beyotime) for 5 min. Subsequently, the fluorescence signals were detected by using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For phalloidin staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100, incubated with phalloidin (Yeasen, Cat. #40786ES75, Shanghai, China) for 30 min, and counterstained with DAPI for 10 min. Then, the fluorescence signals were detected using the Nikon A1R confocal microscope (Nikon, Japan). Patient information Three NSCLC patients exhibiting resistance to osimertinib were selected from the Affiliated Jinling Hospital, Nanjing Medical University. The experiments involving these patients were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Affiliated Jinling Hospital, Nanjing Medical University (No. 2023DZGZR-030). Xenograft experiment A total of 20 male nude mice (BALB/c) aged 4–6 weeks were procured from GemPharmatech (Nanjing, China) for xenograft experiments. The well-grown PC9-OR cells (3 × 10 6 3 2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay Paraffin sections were used for IHC experiments on samples from three patients and twenty mice. The slides were antigen-retrieved and incubated overnight with E-cadherin (1∶200, Cat. #3195, CST), N-cadherin (1∶1000, Cat. #66219-1-Ig, Proteintech), vimentin (1∶200, Cat. #5741, CST), VEGFA (1∶500, Cat. #19003-1-AP, Proteintech), and Ki-67 (1∶300, Cat. #ab15580, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), respectively. Then, the slides were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the indicated proteins were visualized using diaminobenzidine (DAB, Cat. #K3468, Dako, Denmark). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated with graded ethanol before being sealed for microscopic observations. The IHC staining density was scored as negative or weakly positive (score 1), moderately positive (score 2), or strongly positive (score 3). The percentage of positive cancer cells was classified as 1 (< 25%), 2 (25%–50%), 3 (50%–75%), and 4 (> 75%). An H-score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score and the proportion score to quantitatively evaluate the protein expression. TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay For the TUNEL experiment, the paraffin sections of mouse samples were deparaffinized and subsequently processed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cat. #A112, Vazyme). After DAPI counterstaining, the apoptotic signals were observed using a microscope and photographed for subsequent statistical analysis. Statistical analysis The intensity of the Western blotting bands was quantified using ImageJ software. The Student's t * P ** P *** P Results Anlotinib reversed clinical osimertinib resistance and EMT formation in Osi-R patients It is known that cancer patients may develop resistance to osimertinib over time. In a case study, a 57-year-old male was diagnosed with lung cancer at stage T4N0M1a and underwent a lung biopsy in August 2017. The patient exhibited an EGFR EGFR Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Figure 1 Combination therapy of osimertinib and anlotinib was effective for osimertinib-resistant (Osi-R) patients. A: A patient with EGFR Increasing studies have focused on the mechanisms of osimertinib resistance, but mechanisms and treatment options targeting EMT, one of the bypass mechanisms of osimertinib resistance, have received less attention from investigators, compared with other resistance mechanisms. To explore the specific metastatic mechanisms in lung cancer patients with osimertinib resistance, three patients who underwent a secondary lung biopsy at the Affiliated Jinling Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, were recruited. Paraffin sections of lung tissues were used for IHC experiments. The results indicated a decrease in the expression levels of E-cadherin but an increase in the expression levels of vimentin in the lung tissues of these three patients upon developing resistance ( Fig. 1C Fig. 1D Fig. 1C 1D Establishment and identification of PC9-OR and HCC827-OR cells To elucidate the mechanisms and clinical treatment strategies associated with the EMT-induced osimertinib resistance, we performed a series of experiments by stimulating PC9 and HCC827 cells with osimertinib starting at a concentration of 1 nmol/L. Upon observing cell viability even at 1 μmol/L osimertinib, we further treated the PC9, PC9-OR, HCC827, and HCC827-OR cells with osimertinib at various concentrations.

The results revealed that this combination effectively inhibited the migratory ability of PC9-OR and HCC827-OR cells, ultimately enhancing their sensitivity to osimertinib ( Fig. 5A 5D Fig. 5E Fig. 5F 5G Figure 5 Combination of osimertinib and anlotinib reversed the EMT in resistant cells.

Anlotinib inhibits the migration of Osi-R cells, offering a potential solution to combat osimertinib resistance. The combination of osimertinib and anlotinib emerges as a promising clinical strategy for patients, holding the potential to extend their survival time.
