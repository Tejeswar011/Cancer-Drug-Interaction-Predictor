While testosterone often leads to menstrual suppression, it is not a reliable source of contraception and can be teratogenic. Our patient presented to the clinic at age 18 to establish care and resume gender-affirming hormone therapy with testosterone (GAHT-T). The patient's first visit, typically a comprehensive intake conducted to understand patients' general health and transition-related goals, which includes discussion surrounding sexual health and family planning, was truncated due to time constraints. However, a joint decision was made to restart GAHT-T given its importance for the patient's health and transition. Routine labs to assess hormone levels were conducted at follow-up and incidentally showed rising estradiol levels, which are unusual for patients on GAHT-T, and triggered concern and evaluation for a possible underlying endocrine tumor. The patient was ultimately determined to have a single intrauterine pregnancy at 35 weeks of gestation. Understanding patients’ comprehensive health and transition-related goals and routinely engaging in shared decision-making can optimize options, autonomy, well-being, and health outcomes for TGD patients. Providers should be skilled in sensitively and meaningfully engaging patients in conversations surrounding overall health, sexual health, contraception counseling, family planning, fertility preservation, and options when there is a late diagnosis of pregnancy. Our patient shares insight on the physical and psychological impact of their journey and the significance of open and safe patient-provider relationships in supporting whole health for patients. estradiol gender-affirming care methods of contraception pregnancy detection testosterone Nupur Agrawal's contributions reported here were supported in part by the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Testosterone therapy can be an important component of care for transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) patients assigned female at birth (AFAB) who wish to pursue hormonal transition. Testosterone is a known teratogen that can cause virilization of a fetus with XX chromosomes [ 1 2 3 Case presentation Our patient presented to the clinic at age 18 to establish care and reinitiate gender-affirming hormone therapy with testosterone (GAHT-T) after experiencing a lapse in care. The patient was AFAB, identified as a transgender male, and used they/them pronouns. They knew they were transgender their whole life but did not have the terminology to express their gender to others until ninth grade. They previously completed leuprolide therapy and were on GAHT-T, which was interrupted several months prior due to insurance changes. Upon presentation to our clinic, they were eager to restart GAHT-T. Relevant past medical history included a body mass index (BMI) of 44.14 kg/m 2 A detailed intake for patients initially presenting to our clinic is offered and encouraged (Figure 1 Figure 1 Engaging in shared decision-making with AFAB patients interested in GAHT-T AFAB: assigned female at birth, GAHT-T: gender-affirming hormone therapy with testosterone. This figure was created by the authors and is original work developed specifically for this case study. The patient followed up eight weeks after restarting GAHT-T at which time hormone analysis revealed testosterone levels on the low end for GAHT-T and markedly elevated estradiol levels (Table 1 Upon presentation to the endocrinology clinic, the patient denied vaginal bleeding and chest (breast) tenderness. The date of their last menstrual period was reported as two years prior. Physical exam was notable for BMI 42.6 kg/m², mild facial hair development, and central adiposity. Comprehensive endocrinology labs were performed, and estradiol levels were confirmed to be elevated by mass spectrometry (Table 1 4 5 1 Table 1 Laboratory test results GAHT-T: gender-affirming hormone therapy with testosterone, LH: luteinizing hormone, FSH: follicle-stimulating hormone, AMH: anti-Müllerian hormone, CA-125: cancer antigen 125, DHEA: dehydroepiandrosterone, hCG: human chorionic gonadotropin.

Testosterone was immediately discontinued, and the patient was urgently scheduled with obstetrics, maternal-fetal medicine, and psychology. Detailed fetal anatomic ultrasound revealed a viable fetus with XX chromosomes and no obvious anatomic defects or evidence of virilization.

Provider Role Primary care provider Conducted initial intake and follow up visits with patient Engaged in shared-decision making with patient to develop comprehensive care plan, including general and gender health-related goals Prescribed and managed GAHT-T Ordered and interpreted GAHT-T monitoring labs Referred patient to endocrinology after serial labs showed elevated estradiol levels Coordinated care for patient with specialists once pregnancy was confirmed Provided ongoing support to patient after delivery Endocrinologist Conducted endocrinology intake with patient Ordered lab and imaging studies to determine underlying cause of elevated estradiol levels Performed follow up history to investigate cause of elevated beta-hCG levels and diagnosed pregnancy General obstetrician and gynecologist Conducted prenatal and postnatal visits with patient Coordinated delivery Maternal-fetal medicine specialist Performed fetal anatomy scan Psychologist Conducted prenatal psychosocial assessment and provided targeted support to patient Administrative staff Supported patient in scheduling primary care, subspecialty, and therapy visits after diagnosis of pregnancy After the diagnosis of pregnancy, the patient faced limited options for perinatal decisions and limited time to prepare for postpartum considerations. However, they went on to have an uncomplicated normal spontaneous vaginal delivery of a viable AFAB infant at 37 weeks 2 days with no apparent abnormalities or virilization. The patient was seen by social work and lactation postpartum and chose to remain off GAHT-T to chest feed the baby. The patient's partner and family have been very supportive in caring for the baby. Their child is now six years old and thriving. Discussion Our patient's case highlights the need for robust counseling, guidance, and access to sexual and reproductive healthcare for AFAB individuals on GAHT-T. Significant barriers exist that limit providers’ ability to provide sufficient counseling [ 6 Conducting a detailed intake and baseline labs prior to starting GAHT is advantageous because it allows the patient and provider to establish a care plan that supports the patient’s health in a holistic manner. In our patient’s case, it would have helped the primary care provider learn that the patient was sexually active and at risk for pregnancy, triggering a conversation on safe sex practices, family planning, contraception, and possibly pregnancy testing. Thorough knowledge of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception, access to routine pregnancy and STD testing, and encouragement to engage in these conversations can empower patients to make well-informed decisions on family planning. Patients value our team’s comprehensive approach to patient care and the opportunity to discuss in detail the risks, benefits, and alternative treatments available to them as part of their transition. The most notable disadvantage of performing a detailed intake prior to prescribing GAHT is that it may be perceived as gatekeeping, which can be problematic as TGD patients already face numerous barriers to care, including delays in appropriate healthcare and suboptimal health outcomes. We address this by engaging in informed decision-making with patients and encouraging them to take a proactive role in their care. Even when providers have the opportunity to conduct a detailed intake, many lack the knowledge and comfort needed to engage TGD patients in informed discussions about reproductive health. They may be unsure of gender-inclusive terminology for body parts, processes, and procedures and may alienate patients by using inappropriate terminology [ 6 7 8 Providers should reassure patients that appointments are confidential and protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Extra care should be taken to ensure that patients’ gender history is not shared with anyone outside the medical team and that the medical record appropriately reflects their lived name, gender identity, and pronouns. Counseling about contraception options should be individualized based on patient preference and risk factors. Providers should have an understanding of patients’ identity and their social situation to engage in shared decision-making [ 6 7 9 Shared decision-making should also be used to address contraceptive options, including benefits, limitations, and how their use may affect transition goals. The major classes of hormonal and non-hormonal birth control are explored in Table 3 10 Table 3 Contraceptive options and considerations for AFAB TGD patients DMPA: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, IM: intramuscular, SQ: subcutaneous, IUS: intrauterine system, AFAB: assigned female at birth, TGD: transgender and gender diverse.

Amenorrhea is often the first clue to detecting pregnancy in a clinical setting; however, the majority of TGD patients on testosterone experience cessation of menses, thus limiting the use of amenorrhea as a diagnostic tool [ 10 Current standards of care for TGD individuals on GAHT-T provide minimal guidance on contraception and conception counseling. Our patient's experience highlights the need for understanding potential physician bias, shared decision-making with patients on pregnancy testing, appropriate knowledge of contraception options, and the physical and psychological risks of unintended pregnancy. Strong patient-physician relationships entrenched in trust, compassion, and open pathways of communication can support patients in achieving their sexual health and family planning goals while minimizing the risk of unplanned pregnancies. Patient perspective My GAHT-T had a six-week lapse when I switched from a pediatric to an adult provider; I became pregnant in that window without knowing it. When I went to my new physician’s office to establish care and restart testosterone, I was not able to fully complete the process of getting to know my doctor and obtaining the recommended blood work due to logistical issues. After restarting testosterone, I returned to see my doctor to monitor my hormone levels. The initial labs showed high estrogen levels that needed to be rechecked. I assumed the lab had made a mistake but felt worse when I found out my repeat estrogen levels were even higher than before. More tests showed estrogen levels in the thousands, and I was told these were concerning for a tumor. I was terrified that I was going to need surgery. In discussing next steps, we realized I was pregnant. The doctors on my care team referred me to OBGYN, where we confirmed that my baby was healthy and without abnormalities. After OB appointments almost every other day for about one month, I delivered my daughter, who was perfectly healthy and happy. I had gone almost the full length of my pregnancy not knowing I was pregnant and felt like a horrible parent as a result. It was difficult explaining to others that I did not know I was pregnant: I had no idea what it felt like to be pregnant and had easily attributed the fatigue to viral colds, the headaches to lack of sleep, and the weight changes to a desire to be healthier but not always being able to access a nutritious diet as a high school student. The thought of pregnancy never crossed my mind. Aside from a quick overview of sex in the sixth grade, I never received a safe sex talk and could not discuss the topic with my religious family, who believe in an abstinence-only approach until marriage. Having had to rush to prepare myself mentally and physically to be a parent and care for another human being, I believe the patient-physician relationship is a crucial space to discuss sexual health. Sexual activity should be assumed, and pregnancy should always be a consideration in patients able to become pregnant regardless of transition status. Physicians should let patients know that they have the patients’ best interests at heart and are in their corner. These discussions should occur in private without parents present, and physicians should make patients feel heard and in control of their decisions. Appropriate care steps (e.g., possible need for a pregnancy test) should be explained in understandable terms, and options should be provided when possible. Patients come from different family backgrounds and support systems, so creating a safe space where they can be open and honest will support their care long-term. These steps can prevent others from going through the fear and trauma I experienced and give them more options for their care. Conclusions Understanding patients’ comprehensive health and transition-related goals and routinely engaging in shared decision-making can optimize options, autonomy, well-being, and health outcomes for TGD patients. Providers should be skilled in sensitively and meaningfully engaging patients in conversations surrounding overall health, sexual health, contraception counseling, and options available when there is a late diagnosis of pregnancy.
