This review synthesizes evidence that holobionts, from plants to animals, rely on microbial partnerships to thrive under environmental challenges. We trace the evolutionary origins of these alliances to ancient microbial consortia, which enabled metabolic innovation and stress resilience. In plants, microbiome-mediated mechanisms (e.g., rhizosphere methanotrophs enhancing drought tolerance) optimize nutrient acquisition and pathogen defense. In animals, the gut microbiota influences systemic health through multi-organ axes (e.g., gut–brain communication via microbial metabolites). Cross-kingdom parallels reveal conserved principles, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) facilitating inter-holobiont signaling. Emerging tools, like microbiome engineering, harness these interactions for climate-resilient agriculture and precision medicine. By framing adaptation as a collective trait of the holobiont, this work bridges evolutionary biology, microbiology, and ecology, offering actionable insights for sustainability and health. Abstract The holobiont paradigm, conceptualizing host–microbiome assemblages as functionally integrated entities, has fundamentally altered interpretations of adaptive responses to environmental pressures spanning multiple organizational levels. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on microbiome-host coevolution, focusing on three key aspects. First, it examines the evolutionary origins of holobionts from primordial microbial consortia. Second, it considers the mechanistic basis of microbiome-mediated stress resilience in plants and animals. Finally, it explores the ecological implications of inter-holobiont interactions.

Introduction Many studies indicate that life on Earth emerged in a microbial world, where prokaryotic alliances shaped the evolutionary trajectory of multicellular organisms. The holobiont theoretical framework proposes that host organisms and their resident microbial communities undergo reciprocal evolutionary processes as mutually dependent assemblages, wherein microbial influences span from molecular mechanisms to landscape-level ecological dynamics [ 1 2 Symbiodinium 3 Riftia pachyptila Endoriftia 4 This synthesis challenges the traditional host-centric view of adaptation, arguing that stress responses are emergent properties of the holobiont. By unifying data from molecular microbiology, systems biology, and ecology, we provide a framework to harness microbiome plasticity for climate-resilient agriculture and precision medicine. Our analysis draws on recent advances in metagenomics, metabolomics, and experimental evolution, with an emphasis on recently published studies. While excellent reviews have examined holobiont evolution (e.g., Bordenstein and Theis, 2015 [ 2 5 6 7 2. From Primordial Soup to Coevolved Consortia: The Deep Roots of Symbiosis Contemporary paleobiological data indicates accelerated biogenesis on early Earth, with prokaryotic dominance established approximately 3.5–3.7 billion years before present. Eukaryotic lineages are theorized to have emerged subsequently (~2.1 billion years ago) through endosymbiotic incorporation events in which ancestral archaea may have engulfed prokaryotes, giving rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts [ 8 1 9 10 On the early Earth—an anoxic world inhabited exclusively by microorganisms—a constantly shifting balance of environmental conditions drove the evolution of highly adaptable metabolic strategies. Atmospheric oxygen remained below 0.001% for nearly half of Earth’s history, driving the emergence of prokaryotes that exploited inorganic compounds for energy and fixed CO 2 11 2 12 13 14 3 − 4 2− 3+ In early microbial ecosystems, both competitive and symbiotic interactions shaped community dynamics. These interactions fostered the formation of metabolically integrated microbial consortia characterized by the active exchange of metabolites and genetic material—interdependent communities where microorganisms exchange metabolites and genetic material to optimize collective survival. For example, in anaerobic environments, syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea cooperate tightly: bacteria ferment organic compounds, producing hydrogen and acetate, while archaea consume these byproducts to generate methane, preventing metabolic inhibition. Such consortia, which we designate as protomicrobiomes, represent the first functional microbiomes. Specialization emerged not only at the level of individual microorganisms but also at the community level, leading to the development of functionally specialized microbiomes. Such communities are hypothesized to have preceded and facilitated the cellular and tissue specialization seen in multicellular life. The advent of multicellular organisms coincided with the appearance of their associated microbiomes, forming what we call protoholobionts, precursors of holobionts. These protoholobionts represent an evolutionary transition toward complex holobionts—multicellular eukaryotes forming obligate partnerships with phylogenetically diverse microbiota (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and protists)—where host–microbiome metabolic complementarity established a functionally integrated metaorganism with emergent ecological capabilities [ 2 15 Figure 1 Marine environments provide compelling examples of ancient protomicrobiome dynamics that persist today. Deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities exemplify these primordial partnerships, where sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (e.g., Thiomicrospira Riftia pachyptila 16 17 Aplysina aerophoba 18 19 A sustained rise in atmospheric oxygen levels occurred between 2.1 and 2.4 billion years ago, marking the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) [ 12 20 Surprisingly, despite the similar number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in multicellular organisms such as humans, the functional genetic contribution from prokaryotes far exceeds that of the host, with an estimated 3–10 million microbial genes compared to approximately 20,000 human genes. This vast repertoire of prokaryotic genes provides a dynamic source of proteins that contribute significantly to holobiont physiology. The evolutionary plasticity of microbial genomes, facilitated by horizontal gene transfer and alternative regulatory mechanisms, enables rapid metabolic adjustments in response to environmental change. For example, the evolutionary plasticity of microbial genomes, facilitated by horizontal gene transfer and alternative regulatory mechanisms, enables rapid metabolic adjustments in response to environmental perturbations. These adaptive responses are mediated through diverse microbial metabolites that serve as crucial signaling molecules. Notably, intestinal microbe-synthesized short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)—encompassing acetate, propionate, and butyrate—demonstrate the capacity for regulating the host metabolic homeostasis and immunological responses across timeframes spanning minutes to hours [ 21 Similarly, tryptophan metabolism by commensal bacteria yields neuroactive compounds such as serotonin and indole derivatives, which directly influence enteric nervous system activity and central neurological processes [ 22 23 24 25 26 3. The Plant Microbiome Within plant–microbial associations, compartmentalized microbial communities inhabit distinct anatomical niches, with root-zone assemblages representing the most extensively characterized system. This rhizospheric habitat offers conducive environmental parameters—including hydration gradients, oxygen availability, and exudate-derived carbon sources—facilitating intensive microbial establishment. Other microbiomes include the endosphere (within roots), phyllosphere (aerial parts), anthosphere (flowers), and spermosphere (seeds), each performing specialized functions. The rhizosphere microbiome plays key roles in mitigating abiotic stresses (e.g., drought, salinity) and biotic stresses (e.g., pathogen defense) and enhancing nutrient acquisition (e.g., nitrogen metabolism, phosphate and potassium solubilization) [ 27 28 29 30 Pseudomonas Enterobacter Table 1 Microbial cooperation emerges through cross-feeding synergies (e.g., auxin-producing bacteria stimulating fungal growth), collective biofilm formation mediated by quorum sensing, and coordinated suppression of pathogens via antibiotic production or niche competition, among others [ 24 32 32 35 In contrast to the rhizosphere, the anthosphere microbiome plays a central role in reproductive fitness by influencing floral physiology and ecology [ 36 37 38 38 39 4 2 2 31 While bacterial communities can persist independently of plants in soil ecosystems, the rapid formation of functional holobionts occurs through chemotactic recruitment toward plant exudates, a process mediated by conserved molecular signaling. For instance, specific flavonoids (e.g., luteolin) and dicarboxylic acids (e.g., malate) serve as chemoattractants that guide microbial assembly within hours of seed germination [ 25 The success of microbiome metabolic pathways is evolutionarily encoded through feedback loops. On the one hand, microbial byproducts (e.g., auxins, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, or ACC deaminase) directly enhance host fitness, creating selective pressure for mutualism. On the other hand, eukaryotic hosts actively reward beneficial symbionts through preferential carbon allocation (e.g., increased sucrose secretion for nitrogen-fixing rhizobia); in addition, horizontal gene transfer disseminates adaptive traits (e.g., nodulation genes) across microbial populations, as demonstrated in experimental rhizosphere evolution studies [ 40 Extremophilic plant holobionts provide additional evidence of microbiome-mediated environmental adaptation. Spartina alterniflora Halomonas Marinobacter + + 41 Oxyria digyna Pseudomonas Flavobacterium 42 43 4. The Animal Microbiome: Establishment, Composition, and Host Interactions Animal microbiome assembly occurs via three principal acquisition pathways: (1) maternal–offspring transfer encompassing parturition canal exposure, lactational inoculation, and dermal contact (e.g., transfer of Bifidobacterium longum Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 44 45 46 There are arguments to consider the presence of niche-specific microbial communities. In this regard, gut microbiota is dominated by Firmicutes ( Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus Bacteroides, Prevotella Bifidobacterium Methanobrevibacter smithii 47 Cutibacterium acnes Staphylococcus epidermidis Corynebacterium Malassezia 48 Streptococcus pneumoniae Moraxella catarrhalis 49 It is important to consider the host–microbiome co-adaptation, where host genetics significantly shape microbial composition through mechanisms like the HLA-mediated selection of Bacteroides Alistipes 50 Clostridia Lactobacillus rhamnosus 51 The human microbiome, which is particularly dense and diverse in the gut, constitutes a complex microbial ecosystem with critical implications for host health. Its development begins at birth and stabilizes into an individual-specific composition, although consistent patterns allow classification into enterotypes. Microbial homeostasis, or eubiosis, supports systemic equilibrium, while dysbiosis has been associated with inflammatory, metabolic, and neurological disorders. Intestinal microbial communities engage in reciprocal communication with central nervous structures through neural, immunological, and hormonal networks, regulating neurotransmitter synthesis, enteric barrier integrity, and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal system activity. This gut–brain axis influences mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of diseases such as depression, autism, and Alzheimer’s disease [ 22 52 Lymph nodes are strategically located near microbe-rich sites (e.g., mesenteric, cervical, inguinal, and axillary regions) and are traditionally linked to immune filtration and lipid transport. However, emerging evidence suggests they play a broader role in distributing microbial metabolites to less colonized tissues via the lymphatic system, potentially regulating host metabolism and systemic homeostasis. Studies of the gut–liver axis have demonstrated that metabolite transport occurs via both mesenteric lymphatics and venous circulation, modulating hepatic function [ 34 53 The cervical and axillary regions are key anatomical sites where dense microbial colonization interfaces with regional lymph nodes. These spatially organized interfaces between microbial reservoirs and regional lymph nodes are summarized in Table 2 Fusobacterium Prevotella Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria Veillonella Corynebacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis Cutibacterium acnes Malassezia Staphylococcus hominis Aerococcus 54 These microbial reservoirs actively engage with local lymphoid tissues. Cervical lymph nodes sample oral and nasal microbiota to shape mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses, while axillary lymph nodes process skin-derived antigens to regulate cutaneous immunity against pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus 55 56 While most research emphasizes neural pathways—particularly in the highly innervated mesenteric region—gut microbes also produce neuroactive compounds capable of engaging both the enteric and central nervous systems. These findings reinforce the microbiome’s central role in host physiology across multiple organ systems [ 34 53 5. On the Interaction Between Different Holobionts While microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) appear to function as signaling molecules across diverse biological systems, claims of their universality require careful scrutiny. The assumption that these compounds operate through conserved mechanisms across kingdoms oversimplifies the complex, context-dependent nature of host–microbiome interactions and risks creating misleading generalizations about holobiont communication networks. Cross-species microbial transfer occurs through multiple ecological routes: (1) plant–to–animal transmission via the consumption of phyllosphere Methylobacterium or rhizosphere Pseudomonas Akkermansia muciniphila Staphylococcus hominis 57 58 Escherichia coli 59 Figure 2 Hosts actively shape microbial communities through ecological filtering (avian crop pH selection for acid-tolerant Lactobacillus Bacillus 60 61 Vibrio shiloi Helicobacter pylori 62 63 Bifidobacterium 64 Microbial assemblages affiliated with diverse organisms—spanning human, animal, and plant systems—exert physiological influence on target holobionts via VOC synthesis. These microbially derived gaseous signals function at spatial distances, affecting both symbiotic hosts and proximate organisms. In plants, certain microbial VOCs enhance stress tolerance (e.g., drought or salinity) and facilitate nutrient acquisition, such as iron or sulfur uptake under limiting conditions [ 65 Similar inter-organismal VOC-mediated communication occurs in humans and non-human animals. Microbial communities produce gaseous metabolites that influence not only their host’s physiology and behavior, but also that of nearby individuals [ 66 67 68 p 69 However, the interpretation of VOCs as universal signaling molecules is problematic when examined critically. In plants, certain microbial VOCs have been reported to enhance stress tolerance and facilitate nutrient acquisition [ 65 70 Similarly, the extrapolation from animal gut-derived VOCs to inter-organismal communication represents a significant conceptual leap unsupported by mechanistic evidence. While microbial communities produce gaseous metabolites, including SCFAs, sulfur-containing compounds, and phenolic derivatives [ 67 68 Furthermore, the claimed universality of SCFA signaling across kingdoms ignores fundamental physiological differences in receptor systems and metabolic pathways. While butyrate modulates histone deacetylase activity in mammalian cells, plants lack the specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate SCFA signaling in animals. Instead, plant responses to bacterial SCFAs appear to involve non-specific effects on cell membrane integrity and osmotic balance, mechanisms that are neither specific nor evolutionarily conserved [ 71 The host-specificity of microbial metabolite responses is further exemplified by species-specific differences in cytochrome P450 enzymes, which determine metabolite bioavailability and activity. For instance, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) production from gut bacterial trimethylamine varies 100-fold between humans and rodents due to differences in hepatic flavin monooxygenase expression, rendering animal model studies questionably relevant to human physiology [ 72 Context-dependent outcomes represent another critical limitation in generalizing metabolite signaling functions. The immunomodulatory effects of bacterial metabolites like indole derivatives are highly dependent on the host immune status, age, and concurrent inflammatory conditions. In healthy individuals, these compounds may promote regulatory T cell responses, while in immunocompromised hosts, the same metabolites can exacerbate inflammatory cascades [ 73 Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of metabolite signaling complicate universal interpretations. Bacterial production of signaling compounds follows circadian rhythms, nutrient availability cycles, and population density fluctuations, which may be completely misaligned with host physiological requirements. The half-life of most microbial VOCs ranges from minutes to hours, creating temporal windows where signaling is either absent or saturated. These conditions are incompatible with reliable inter-organismal communication [ 74 Therefore, while microbial metabolites undoubtedly play important roles in host–microbiome interactions, their characterization as “universal signaling molecules” appears to be an oversimplification that conflates superficial similarities with mechanistic conservation. A more nuanced interpretation would recognize these compounds as context-dependent modulatory factors whose effects are constrained by host-specific physiology, environmental conditions, and evolutionary contingency. 6. How the Environment Influences Holobiont Colonization The rhizosphere, characterized by its nutrient richness and microbial diversity, serves as a favorable niche for microbial proliferation. However, successful plant establishment depends on seed dispersal to unoccupied soils, minimizing competition. At germination, the seed-associated microbiome (spermosphere) is relatively limited. In experimental settings, germination can be studied using virus-free and microbe-free plantlets derived from surface-sterilized seeds or meristem-derived tissue cultures grown under sterile conditions. These axenic cultures are often used in plant biotechnology and plant–microbiome interaction studies to ensure the absence of endogenous viruses, bacteria, or fungi, enabling controlled inoculation and colonization experiments. These virus-free systems can be established using shoot tip cultures treated with antiviral agents or thermotherapy, followed by in vitro propagation on sterile media [ 75 76 Seed germination releases specific exudates—such as sugars, amino acids, organic acids, and phenolic compounds—that selectively stimulate or inhibit microbial taxa. For instance, copiotrophs like Pseudomonas Enterobacter 77 78 Bacillus amyloliquefaciens Ba 32 79 B. velezensis Bacillus 32 Soil physicochemical parameters (e.g., pH, redox potential, moisture) modulate interactions between the plant, the microbiota, and the environment, shaping a unique holobiont. Microbial recruitment pathways include abiotic vectors (wind, water) and biotic routes such as “bacterial highways” formed by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [ 80 81 82 In parallel, animal (especially human) microbiome colonization is not purely stochastic, but instead influenced by congenital, inherited, and intrauterine factors. Humans serve as a model to contrast microbiome development between vaginal and cesarean births. In C-sections, the initial microbial exposure is largely hospital-derived. Nevertheless, considerable interindividual microbiome variation persists due to prenatal factors. Embryonic and fetal development establishes a biochemical environment—partially modulated by the maternal microbiome—that predisposes the neonate to colonization by specific microorganisms. Maternal microbiota influence immune system priming, which guides postnatal microbial assembly. Additionally, the placenta, once considered sterile, hosts its own microbiome, contributing to maternal and fetal health and potentially conditioning neonatal microbial colonization [ 83 84 7. How the Microbiome Comes to Dominate the Holobiont In mammals, microbiome colonization occurs primarily via exposure to the maternal vaginal microbiota during birth, skin-to-skin contact, and lactation. Social behaviors, including physical contact, sharing surfaces (fomites), and sexual activity, further promote microbial exchange in social species. Microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract can modulate host feeding behavior through evolutionarily adaptive strategies that enhance their own fitness, potentially at the host’s expense. Ribeiro et al. [ 33 33 Alistipes Bifidobacterium 85 Symbiosis between hosts and their microbiomes is viewed as a natural outcome of evolutionary processes, enabling rapid holobiont adaptation to environmental shifts. Microbiota–host interactions extend beyond individual adaptation, mediating communication and cooperation between holobionts. These inter-holobiont relationships are not confined to taxonomic boundaries, but instead form integrated ecosystems, where metabolic complementarity—akin to microbial cross-feeding—enhances the fitness of both the individual holobionts and the broader ecological community ( Figure 3 Table 3 8. Conclusions The holobiont paradigm has revolutionized our understanding of biological systems, revealing that stress adaptation, metabolism, and even behavior emerge from dynamic host–microbiome interactions. As demonstrated, microbial consortia drive ecosystem resilience, from methane-oxidizing bacteria enhancing plant drought tolerance to gut microbiota modulating neuroendocrine pathways in animals. However, critical gaps remain. Current research prioritizes taxonomic profiling, but functional redundancy across microbiomes suggests that metabolic networks—not specific taxa—may dictate holobiont fitness. Future studies should leverage metatranscriptomics and metabolomics to dissect how Marine holobionts provide immediate opportunities for climate adaptation strategies. Coral probiotic therapies using thermotolerant Symbiodinium Acropora 86 87 Eriophorum 88 89 The gut–brain axis exemplifies how microbial metabolites influence host physiology. Could future therapies combine probiotics with personalized 33 If individual holobionts cooperate via volatile signals (e.g., plant–plant communication via microbial VOCs), we could speculate that entire ecosystems might function as “meta-holobionts” ( Figure 4 The holobiont lens challenges reductionist biology, urging the integration of microbial ecology into medicine, agriculture, and climate science. As we advance, interdisciplinary collaboration spanning synthetic biology, systems ecology, and AI-driven modeling will be essential to harness holobiont dynamics for a sustainable future. However, we must remain vigilant, as manipulating these relationships poses risks with unintended consequences, demanding rigorous safeguards alongside innovation. Microbiome engineering represents a transformative frontier with unprecedented potential to address global challenges in health, agriculture, and environmental restoration, while simultaneously presenting complex risks that demand careful consideration. The therapeutic applications show remarkable promise. Engineered Lactobacillus 90 91 32 92 Environmental restoration applications show particular promise, as methanotrophic bacterial partnerships can reduce greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing plant establishment in degraded soils, offering scalable climate mitigation strategies [ 31 93 94 Bacillus 95 Ethical frameworks must evolve to address environmental releases where engineered microorganisms affect global ecosystem services, particularly regarding informed consent when microbial interventions can possibly horizontally transmit to communities without permission, as well as the potential displacement of Indigenous knowledge systems through technological dependence [ 96 97 Climate resilience strategies must shift from protecting isolated organisms toward preserving and restoring holobiont networks that maintain ecosystem functionality under changing conditions. This requires integrating microbial diversity metrics into biodiversity indices, e.g., recognizing that a forest’s carbon sequestration capacity depends as much on the soil microbial consortia as on its plant species’ composition and interactions. Agricultural policies must evolve beyond yield optimization to encompass soil microbiome health indicators, establishing payment schemes for ecosystem services that reward farmers for maintaining beneficial microbial diversity rather than merely for crop productivity. Marine protected area design should prioritize microbial connectivity corridors that enable holobiont adaptation across temperature and pH gradients, while climate adaptation strategies must account for the fact that species range shifts are ultimately constrained by the dispersal and establishment capacity of their essential microbial partners. Urban planning frameworks require the integration of “microbial infrastructure” considerations—green spaces designed not just for human recreation but also as reservoirs and corridors for beneficial microbiomes that support both ecosystem services and human health. International climate agreements must recognize that methane mitigation strategies could leverage natural methanotrophic partnerships rather than relying solely on technological solutions, while biodiversity targets should include quantitative goals for maintaining functional microbial diversity alongside traditional species metrics. Perhaps most critically, environmental impact assessments must incorporate holobiont-scale analyses that evaluate how proposed developments will affect not just visible species but also the microbial networks that underpin ecosystem resilience, recognizing that disrupting these invisible partnerships may have cascading consequences that manifest only across ecological timescales. This holobiont-informed policy framework would represent a paradigm shift from managing individual components toward stewarding the microbial foundations of planetary health, acknowledging that, in an era of rapid environmental change, our survival depends on maintaining the ancient partnerships that have enabled life’s persistence through previous global transitions.
