Summary The detailed mechanisms underlying the regulatory significance of dietary components in modulating anti-tumor immunity remain largely unknown. Here, we apply a co-culture-based screening approach using a blood nutrient compound library and identify zeaxanthin (ZEA), a dietary carotenoid pigment found in many fruits and vegetables and known for its role in eye health, as an immunomodulator that enhances the cytotoxicity of CD8 + in vivo + in vivo + in vitro Graphical abstract Highlights • Plant-produced nutrient zeaxanthin enhances the cytotoxicity of CD8 + • Orally supplemented zeaxanthin augments anti-tumor immunity • Zeaxanthin promotes T cell receptor stimulation on CD8 + • Zeaxanthin treatment improves immunotherapy efficacy Mechanistic insights into how dietary components regulate anti-tumor immunity remain limited.

Dietary ZEA can be found in many fruits and green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, broccoli, peas, lettuce, durum wheat, and corn, as well as egg yolks, because common feeds for chickens contain grains such as corn and vegetables enriched with ZEA. 32 33 5 + Our findings support the high translational potential of ZEA, as a natural food component, to serve as a dietary supplement that enhances clinical outcomes of immunotherapies such as ICIs and TCR-T cell therapy. By investigating the physiological influences of diverse diet-derived nutrients on the immune system, our studies contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how dietary nutrients shape human biology, which is crucially informative for dietary choices that may be beneficial for maintaining human health, reducing disease risk, and improving response to therapies.

The resulting cell pellets were re-suspended with 2 mL red cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen), incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and centrifuged at 300×g for 5 min after adding 15 mL PBS. The resulting cell pellets were designated splenocytes and used for the following experiments. For cytokine detection, T cells were stimulated with a cell activation cocktail (Biolegend) for 4h, and then intracellular staining for cytoplasmic protein was performed, followed by flow cytometry analysis. Mouse draining lymph node lymphocyte isolation Draining lymph nodes were disrupted with a syringe plunger in a 70 μm strainer filtered to a 50 mL tube, washed with PBS, and centrifuged at 300×g for 10 min. The resulting cell pellets were designated dLN lymphocytes and used for the following experiments. Flow cytometry analysis Murine primary cells isolated from tumor, spleen, draining lymph node were stained with fluorescent antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. For experiments with live/dead criteria, cells were first stained with Fixable Viability Dyes (FVD) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequent surface marker staining was performed in Cell Staining Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Intracellular staining for flow panels containing nuclear proteins was performed using the eBioscience FoxP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For intracellular staining of cytoplasmic proteins, eBioscience Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

In brief, The ZymoBIOMICS-96 MagBead DNA Kit (Zymo Research) was used to extract DNA using an automated platform. Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene targeted sequencing was performed using the Quick-16S NGS Library Prep Kit (Zymo Research). The bacterial 16S primers amplified the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing library was prepared using an innovative library preparation process in which PCR reactions were performed in real-time PCR machines to control cycles and therefore limit PCR chimera formation. The final PCR products were quantified with qPCR fluorescence readings and pooled together based on equal molarity. The final pooled library was cleaned with the Select-a-Size DNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research), then quantified with TapeStation (Agilent Technologies) and Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard (Zymo Research) was used as a positive control for each DNA extraction, if performed. The final library was sequenced on Illumina MiSeq with a v3 reagent kit (600 cycles). The sequencing was performed with 10% PhiX spike-in.
