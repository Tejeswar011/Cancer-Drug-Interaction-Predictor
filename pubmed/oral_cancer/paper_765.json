This progressive joint pathology results in persistent pain and functional impairment. Currently, convenient oral traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are available, and increasingly precise biologic agents and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) have been developed, offering promising therapeutic options. However, systemic administration generally fails to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations in the joints owing to poor biodistribution and dose-limiting systemic toxicity. Intra-articular (IA) administration has demonstrated promising potential in addressing these challenges. Among the various strategies employed for IA administration, hydrogels have gained significant attention due to their tunable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and controlled release capabilities. These unique properties enable hydrogel-based IA delivery systems to simultaneously modulate the inflammatory microenvironment and protect cartilage tissue. This review comprehensively summarizes the histopathological changes and associated cellular and molecular events in RA, while also highlighting the design principles of hydrogels and advanced strategies for hydrogel-based IA administration. By addressing the limitations of conventional treatments, hydrogel-based IA injection holds significant promise for improving RA treatment. rheumatoid arthritis hydrogel intra-articular multimodal therapy combination therapy CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (CIFMS) 2021-I2M-1-026, China This work was supported by the CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (CIFMS) (2021-I2M-1-026, China). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune condition that causes inflammation in the joints and surrounding soft tissues, leading to discomfort, swelling, and progressive damage to joint structures [ 1 2 3 4 2 3 At the cellular level, the development of RA involves synovial hyperplasia, angiogenesis, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells [ 2 5 2 6 7 8 9 10 Therapeutic agents for RA have advanced considerably over the last few decades. These agents mainly include disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), and biologic agents [ 11 12 13 12 1 14 15 16 17 Intra-articular (IA) delivery system is a promising strategy for RA management. This system directly targets the affected joints and greatly reduces the toxicity caused by systemic drug circulation. However, frequent repeated injections are required due to the therapeutics either being absorbed by synovial tissues or degraded in synovial fluid within hours. Novel drug delivery systems have been constructed to overcome this problem, including both non-hydrogel systems (such as nanoparticles and microparticles) and hydrogel-based platforms. Compared to non-hydrogel systems, hydrogels demonstrate several distinct advantages. While nanoparticles and microparticles can extend drug residence time, hydrogels offer superior biocompatibility and better mimicry of native extracellular matrix (ECM) due to their three-dimensional (3D) hydrophilic polymer networks. This ECM-like structure not only provides better tissue integration but also enables more controlled drug release kinetics. Furthermore, hydrogels can be engineered with stimuli-responsive properties (e.g., responsive to pH, temperature, or enzymatic activity within inflamed joints) that are difficult to achieve with conventional nanoparticle systems [ 16 18 However, each system has its limitations. Nanoparticles and microparticles may face challenges in terms of homogeneous distribution and potential migration from the injection site, while hydrogel-based therapies, despite their significant potential, may be affected by the dynamic inflammatory environment within the synovial cavity, which could hinder sustained drug release and compromise therapeutic efficacy [ 16 This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying RA, with a particular focus on the key cellular players and molecular pathways involved in disease progression. Unlike previous reviews, we systematically analyze how recent advances in understanding these mechanisms have directly informed the rational design of injectable hydrogels over the past five years. Specifically, we critically evaluate (1) RA-mediated cellular reprogramming within synovial tissue microenvironments, (2) the rational engineering principles for hydrogel-based therapeutics, and (3) the biomaterial innovations targeting these pathological cellular processes. By bridging fundamental mechanistic insights with translational hydrogel engineering, this review offers a unique perspective on developing precision biomaterials for RA management. 2. Histopathological Changes and Associated Cellular and Molecular Events in RA The joint is a complex structure composed of two or more bones interconnected by articular cartilage, which minimizes friction. It is surrounded by fibrous connective tissue and synovial membranes. Recent studies have revealed that RA pathogenesis involves multi-site injury of joint tissues, characterized by progressive angiogenesis, inflammation, and synovial hyperplasia. These pathological changes disrupt the joint microenvironment, causing heterogeneous infiltration of inflammatory cells, pathological changes in synovial and joint tissues, dysregulation of inflammatory mediators and signaling pathways, and severe reduction–oxidation (redox) imbalance in the synovium and surrounding joint tissues. Understanding the histopathological changes and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms is critical for developing targeted therapies for RA. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying RA inflammation are illustrated in Figure 1 2.1. Heterogeneous Infiltration of Inflammatory Cells During RA progression, the synovial tissue within affected joints undergoes pathological changes, characterized by heterogeneous infiltration of immune cells, including T cells, macrophages, B cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs). These populations collectively sustain chronic inflammation through distinct mechanisms, ultimately driving the progressive joint destruction of RA [ 2 2.1.1. T Cells T cells, particularly autoreactive CD4 + 19 20 21 + 21 22 23 24 + 25 26 26 26 26 2.1.2. Monocytes and Macrophages The pathogenesis of RA is critically driven by monocytes and macrophages [ 27 28 27 29 30 29 31 29 32 Monocytes undergo significant phenotypic and functional shifts characterized by an enhanced pro-inflammatory capacity and upregulated surface markers [e.g., CD14, CD16, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs)] [ 27 30 33 34 35 Macrophages are exposed to persistent stimulation through high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-1β) [ 28 36 37 2 2.1.3. B Cells During the pathogenesis of RA, B lymphocytes participate in disease progression through multiple mechanisms [ 38 38 39 40 39 41 2.1.4. Neutrophils Neutrophils, as quintessential pro-inflammatory immune cells, actively recruit other immune cells in RA [ 42 43 42 44 45 46 47 2.1.5. DCs DCs significantly influence the pathogenesis of RA by migrating to inflamed synovial tissues, where they activate various immune cells through antigen presentation and cytokine production [ 32 35 48 49 50 51 2.2. Pathological Changes in Synovial and Joint Tissues The synovium and joint tissues in RA undergo pathological changes characterized by three key processes: FLSs activation, pannus invasion, and metabolic dysfunction and oxidative stress. These interconnected mechanisms collectively contribute to the irreversible joint damage. 2.2.1. Fibroblast-like Synoviocytes (FLSs) FLSs experience a sequence of pathological changes during RA progression [ 29 29 52 52 53 54 53 55 29 2.2.2. Pannus A pannus is a hallmark histological feature of RA. It is a granulation tissue composed of proliferating synovial cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and newly formed blood vessels [ 56 56 57 58 59 1 59 2.2.3. Metabolic Dysregulation and Oxidative Stress The accumulation of metabolic waste, particularly lactic acid, reduces the pH of the joint cavity [ 60 61 62 62 63 62 Oxidative stress, characterized by an elevated production of ROS and diminished antioxidant defenses, represents a key hallmark of RA [ 62 62 64 65 66 66 62 67 68 2.3. Inflammatory Mediators and Signaling Pathways RA progression involves a coordinated interplay of inflammatory mediators and dysregulated signaling pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines drive synovitis through NF-κB and JAK-STAT activation, while ROS and prostaglandins amplify tissue damage. Growth factors promote synovial hyperplasia and angiogenesis, working synergistically with autoantibody–complement cascades to sustain inflammation. MMPs execute cartilage degradation, with their production regulated by multiple intracellular signaling pathways. These interconnected processes create a self-perpetuating inflammatory milieu that progressively destroys joint tissues. 2.3.1. Pro-Inflammatory Factors The upregulation of inflammatory cytokines is primarily driven by the activation of immune cells and FLSs within the synovial tissue [ 69 69 8 70 The upregulation of chemokines results from sustained activation of immune cells and FLSs in the inflamed synovium [ 53 53 71 60 71 33 The overproduction of NO and the consequent oxidative/nitrosative stress significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of RA [ 72 − 73 74 75 76 73 Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) serves as a key mediator in driving RA pathology through diverse mechanisms [ 70 77 70 78 79 80 81 82 83 79 79 2.3.2. Growth Factor Growth factors significantly contribute to the progression of RA by modulating inflammation and synovial hyperplasia. Elevated levels of growth factors in the synovial tissue and fluid correlate closely with disease activity [ 84 60 85 61 86 60 61 29 2.3.3. Autoantibodies and the Complement System Autoantibodies, including RF and ACPAs, are considered central drivers of RA [ 87 88 89 80 89 The complement system is activated in the synovial tissue by immune complexes, primarily through the classical and alternative pathways [ 89 90 91 90 91 92 91 93 2.3.4. MMPs MMPs are critical mediators of joint destruction due to their ability to degrade ECM components [ 31 31 94 95 96 97 2.3.5. Signaling Pathways Immune-mediated inflammation in RA is amplified through cytokine-induced signaling pathways that further stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production [ 98 98 99 98 100 100 3. Basic Properties of Hydrogels Hydrogels are 3D polymeric networks composed of hydrophilic polymers that exhibit exceptional water-absorbing capacities, making them highly valuable in biomedical applications. Their physicochemical properties, including swelling behavior, mechanical strength, and degradation kinetics, are controlled by their crosslinking mechanisms and network architecture. Physical crosslinking relies on reversible, non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonding, and polymer entanglement [ 101 Chemical crosslinking forms covalent bond networks through strategies like photoinitiated polymerization, crosslinker-mediated methods, or click chemistry [ 101 102 4. Design and Optimization of Hydrogels Multifunctional systems with spatially controlled bioactivity have been constructed through the precise modulation of the material composition, crosslinking degree, and mechanical properties. These materials can modulate immune cell activity while achieving precise delivery and controlled release of therapeutic agents. The current research is focusing on developing stimuli-responsive materials, optimizing surface modification techniques, and exploring modular assembly strategies to enhance therapeutic precision and biocompatibility. This section analyzes the design principles and functional mechanisms of hydrogels, providing theoretical guidance and technical pathways for developing next-generation biomaterials ( Figure 2 4.1. Material Selection The selection of materials is a fundamental aspect of hydrogel design, directly influencing their mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and functionality. Hydrogels can be fabricated from natural materials, synthetic materials, or composite materials. Natural materials (e.g., collagen, fibrin, and hyaluronan) are widely used in hydrogel delivery systems owing to their adjustable properties, including swelling and deswelling capacity, porosity, permeability, network structure, elasticity, and mechanical strength [ 102 103 104 102 102 105 106 107 108 109 110 4.2. Crosslinking-Driven Hydrogel Customization The crosslinking degree determines the hydrogel’s properties. Higher crosslinking creates tighter networks resulting in stiffer hydrogels that swell less and degrade more slowly. Lower crosslinking forms softer hydrogels. Such hydrogels swell considerably but have relatively weak mechanical strength [ 102 111 To achieve precise control over these properties, contemporary hydrogel designs strategically combine three crosslinking modalities: (1) permanent covalent crosslinking; (2) dynamic covalent crosslinking (e.g., hydrazone bonds [ 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 107 119 4.3. Drug-Loading and Release Mechanisms Drug molecules can be either directly encapsulated in the hydrogel’s porous network or physically/chemically cross-linked to the hydrogel molecular chains. Specifically, physical conjugation relies on non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding [ 120 121 122 110 123 124 125 122 The release of drugs is fundamentally governed by the complex relationship between the hydrogel’s network architecture and the physicochemical properties of the encapsulated therapeutic agents [ 111 126 127 128 111 Recent studies have validated the rational incorporation of nanoparticles or liposomes within hydrogels to enhance their drug-loading capacity and achieve multi-stage release patterns [ 121 122 129 4.4. Responsive Hydrogels Responsive hydrogels are designed to respond to the dynamic changes in the inflammatory microenvironment, providing targeted and on-demand therapeutic effects [ 16 121 130 128 122 131 132 133 5. Injectable Hydrogel Systems for RA Management The current advances in RA treatment are focusing on four key approaches: (i) targeting disease mechanisms, (ii) restoring joint microenvironment homeostasis, (iii) developing smart responsive systems, and (iv) exploring innovative delivery methods. Among these, hydrogel-based IA delivery platforms have revolutionized RA management. Conventional injectable hydrogels, characterized by their sustained and controlled release of drugs, have been extensively studied for prolonging drug retention in the joint cavity and reducing systemic side effects. Many studies have indicated that conventional injectable hydrogels primarily provide drug sustained-release and physical barrier functions in RA treatment ( Table 1 Table 2 5.1. Immunologically Targeted Therapies for RA The development of injectable hydrogel platforms has revolutionized RA treatment by enabling the precise modulation of pathological mechanisms. This section comprehensively reviews recent advances in hydrogel-mediated immunomodulation, with a particular focus on their regulatory effects on immune cells and cytokine networks. 5.1.1. Modulation of Immune Cell Activity and Inflammation RA is characterized by dysregulated immune cell activity. Targeting this process is a key therapeutic strategy. Hydrogels can deliver immunomodulatory agents directly to the synovium, where these agents can suppress the activation and infiltration of immune cells. For instance, a recent study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of fibroin protein hydrogels enhanced with exosomes through in situ photo-crosslinking for RA management [ 149 Additional research established that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) function as immunomodulatory multipotent progenitors to limit RA advancement [ 150 Another study demonstrated that the dual dynamically cross-linked SPT@TPL hydrogel promoted macrophage M2 polarization for RA treatment [ 169 5.1.2. Cytokine Network Modulation and Inflammatory Cascade Regulation The pro-inflammatory cytokines establish a pathological microenvironment in arthritic joints. Targeting the pathological crosstalk between cytokines represents a strategic approach to break the inflammatory cycle in RA. A novel platform was constructed by Wang et al. who introduced a cationic hydrogel loaded with anti-IL-17A nanobodies (Nbs) to synergistically suppress neutrophil-mediated inflammation in RA ( Figure 3 117 A similar strategy was implemented by Chen et al. who developed a thermo-responsive injectable hydrogel for pain relief and cartilage regeneration in RA [ 168 A separate study found that a PC hydrogel with thermo-sensitive properties containing an HA-conjugated TLR4-blocking cyclic peptide [PC+(HA-CP)] regulated cytokine networks in RA [ 163 The development of these immunologically targeted therapies could revolutionize RA treatment by replacing systemic immunosuppression with targeted, sustained therapeutic approaches. 5.2. Restoration of Joint Microenvironment Homeostasis Emerging therapeutic strategies for RA are increasingly focusing on the dysfunctional joint microenvironment, aiming to restore physiological homeostasis. This section examines two critical approaches: (1) modulation of redox homeostasis and (2) promotion of tissue repair. Rebalancing the synovial microenvironment has two therapeutic benefits: effective inflammation control and prevention of pathological progression in RA. 5.2.1. Modulation of Oxidative Stress A critical aspect of joint homeostasis is the regulation of oxidative stress, which causes inflammation and tissue damage in RA. Recent advances have shown that hydrogels designed to scavenge ROS and NO exhibit remarkable therapeutic potential. Yeo et al. developed a NO-responsive and NO-scavenging nanosized hydrogel (NO-Scv gel) for the treatment of RA ( Figure 4 158 Similarly, Xu et al. developed an advanced injectable hydrogel with dual functions of ROS scavenging and self-regulated MTX release for RA treatment [ 132 Another key strategy was developed by Wang et al. who reported a novel multifunctional bio-responsive hydrogel system based on tripolycerol monostearate. This hydrogel was designed to regulate the hypoxic joint microenvironment and deliver psoralen for RA management [ 156 5.2.2. Modulation of Tissue Repair and Regeneration Hydrogels can exert therapeutic effects in RA through tissue repair and regeneration mechanisms. By promoting these regenerative processes, they simultaneously suppress pathological inflammation and angiogenesis. Through their ability to mimic the ECM, hydrogels provide a scaffold that facilitates cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. For example, in the work by Wang et al., a polymer-modified DNA hydrogel co-loaded with Prussian blue nanozymes and functional mitochondria was developed to promote chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation ( Figure 5 151 Similarly, the work by Bahatibieke et al. showed that a polyurethane–gelatin composite hydrogel scaffold (TP@GSPU) concurrently attenuated inflammatory responses and promoted cartilage regeneration in RA [ 170 Through modulating the inflammatory cascade and promoting tissue regeneration, the injectable hydrogel delivery system effectively enhanced therapeutic safety and efficacy. 5.3. Smart Hydrogels with On-Demand Microenvironment Responsiveness Smart hydrogels can be designed to release therapeutic agents in response to specific pathological stimuli (e.g., acidic pH, elevated ROS levels, or overexpressed enzymes) within inflamed joints. This section highlights two innovative strategies: (i) pathological factor-responsive systems and (ii) prodrug-loaded nanocomposite hydrogels, which combine nanoparticle technology with stimuli-responsive release mechanisms and have demonstrated on-demand therapeutic potential for RA management. 5.3.1. Pathological Factor-Triggered Hydrogel Platforms Targeting the pathological microenvironment of RA, researchers have developed stimuli-responsive hydrogel platforms that exploit disease-specific factors (e.g., increased ROS and NO levels, overexpressed enzymes, acidic conditions, and elevated temperatures) to achieve precision therapy. These responsive hydrogels enable on-demand drug release, prolonging therapeutic retention in inflamed joints. For example, inflammation-responsive hydrogels, such as OD-PP@SeNPs, have been developed to scavenge ROS and regulate pH, promoting macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype [ 127 Figure 6 157 155 Several smart delivery systems also demonstrate specific responsiveness to the acidic pH and increased temperature in RA. As a representative example, Liu et al. designed a pH-responsive hydrogel for the treatment of RA [ 159 Temperature-responsive hydrogel systems represent another important class of smart hydrogel platforms. Yin et al. developed a thermosensitive hydrogel (D-NGel) co-loaded with indomethacin and MTX nanoparticles for synergistic RA treatment [ 171 These systems provide rapid coverage of inflamed joint surfaces while establishing a robust platform through on-demand drug release and sustained therapeutic retention, enabling both immediate symptom relief and long-term disease control. 5.3.2. Prodrug-Mimicking Nanoparticle-Loaded Hydrogel Platforms This integrated platform combines stimuli-responsive prodrug nanoparticles with hydrogel carriers for controlled drug delivery. The nanoparticles respond to pathological microenvironments, while the hydrogel acts as a protective reservoir that prevents premature clearance and sustains release at the target site. This system exhibits a sequential release mechanism: progressive hydrogel degradation mediates nanoparticle delivery, followed by stimulus-triggered drug release from the accumulated nanoparticles. Du et al. presented an innovative phospholipid-mimic artemisinin prodrug (ARP) incorporated within a liposome-embedded hydrogel nano/microsphere for RA therapy [ 172 Yang et al. introduced an innovative hierarchical drug delivery system for RA treatment, combining hyaluronic acid (HA) microparticles with MTX-conjugated peptide dendrimer nanoparticles [ 173 An advanced IA delivery system was created by Abou-ElNour et al. through the strategic integration of two functional components: thermo-responsive star-shaped poly copolymers and triamcinolone acetonide-bearing PLA/mPEG-PDL microparticles for optimized RA therapy [ 174 Combining multiple therapeutic agents in hydrogels can further enhance their efficacy. Du et al. developed a nanocomposite hydrogel system using CS and β-GP to encapsulate acid-responsive prodrugs of lenalidomide and hesperidin for the localized treatment of RA [ 129 5.4. Innovative Hydrogel Therapies: Gas-, Sound-, Light-, and 3D Printing-Based Approaches Beyond traditional hydrogel-based treatments, emerging strategies incorporating gas therapy, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and phototherapy/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing RA. Compared with traditional therapies, multimodal hydrogel systems incorporating novel strategies have demonstrated enhanced efficacy. Nevertheless, these emerging technologies present several challenges, including precise control of gas release, potential tissue damage from excessive ROS generation during SDT/PDT, and the limited penetration depth of light-based therapies in joints. 5.4.1. PTT/PDT Light-responsive hydrogels provide a controllable and precise therapeutic platform. Near-infrared (NIR) light can trigger hydrogel degradation or activate embedded nanoparticles to release drugs or generate ROS to eliminate FLSs to suppress inflammation. A related advancement by Chiang et al. involved the design of a photothermal-responsive hydrogel based on methylcellulose for injectable RA treatment [ 153 Similarly, Rui et al. developed a prolonged O 2 2+ 167 2 2 2+ 2 1 2 1 2 2+ 2+ 2+ Another example is the work by Pan et al. who developed a novel multifunctional thermo-responsive hydrogel system based on black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNs) for RA treatment ( Figure 7 162 Wu et al. employed an alternative strategy by introducing an injectable and pH-sensitive peptide hydrogel to co-deliver MTX and bismuthene nanosheets/polyethyleneimine (BiNS/PEI) for RA treatment [ 121 130 5.4.2. Gas Therapy Hydrogel-based gas therapy represents a novel direction for RA. Hydrogels that release therapeutic gas [such as hydrogen (H 2 2 2 140 2 141 2 Xu et al. designed a self-propelled magnesium–hyaluronic acid micromotor for RA treatment [ 175 2 2 Zhao et al. developed a nanozyme-reinforced hydrogel for RA treatment using gas therapy to restore joint microenvironment and enhance prosthetic interface osseointegration [ 140 2 Gas therapy offers distinct therapeutic advantages for RA treatment. The low molecular weight and high diffusibility of therapeutic gases enable deep penetration into inflamed synovial tissues. These gases have multiple functions: mitigating oxidative stress, regulating inflammation, and enhancing tissue regeneration. 5.4.3. SDT Combining hydrogels with ultrasound-responsive agents holds significant potential for RA treatment. Hydrogel-based SDT has not yet been extensively explored, but the idea is theoretically sound. Hydrogels could serve as an ideal platform for localized and sustained SDT. Ultrasound-triggered hydrogels can release drugs or generate ROS to eliminate overactive FLSs and reduce inflammation. Moreover, significant advancements have been made in related nanodelivery systems, which provide valuable insights for future hydrogel-based SDT applications ( Figure 8 176 177 177 1 2 Similarly, Wu et al. explored the potential of SDT in RA by leveraging nanoengineered macrophages as a targeted delivery system [ 176 3 4 3 4 While hydrogel-based SDT is still in its early stages, these advancements in nanodelivery systems provide valuable insights and pave the way for future hydrogel applications in SDT for RA. 5.4.4. Printing-Based Therapy Three-dimensional printing technology has emerged as a transformative tool in the development of hydrogel-based therapies for RA. By leveraging 3D printing, researchers can fabricate hydrogel scaffolds with tailored architectures that mimic the native joint microenvironment, enabling localized and sustained drug delivery. For example, Zhao et al. developed an innovative hybrid system for RA treatment by combining 3D-printed porous metal scaffolds with infliximab-based hydrogels, enabling simultaneous bone defect repair and stem cell-based therapeutic intervention ( Figure 9 152 Elshabrawy et al. developed a triple-layered platform for RA management using 3D printing, electrospinning, and electrospraying [ 178 Currently, 3D printing technology has made it possible to fabricate hydrogel scaffolds that can highly resemble the natural joint microenvironment. These scaffolds offer two primary therapeutic advantages: customized mechanical reinforcement and controlled anti-inflammatory drug release. Through sustained medication delivery and structural stability at injury sites, they can establish an optimal environment for gradual tissue repair. These advantages bring distinctive options for RA management. 6. Challenges and Insights into Future Developments Injectable hydrogels show significant promise for RA management, yet face considerable challenges in both laboratory development and clinical translation. From a materials perspective, the primary challenge lies in balancing mechanical strength with degradation kinetics—rapid degradation risks uncontrolled drug release while slow degradation may trigger immunological rejection. Although inherently biocompatible, hydrogel byproducts can potentially induce immune reactions or chronic inflammation. Researchers must achieve sustained (weeks-to-months), targeted drug delivery to synovial cells within dynamic inflammatory environments, a process complicated by pathological joint changes like synovial hyperplasia that impair hydrogel distribution and lesion coverage. The literature documents numerous successful implementations of such sustained-release systems, with certain hydrogel formulations demonstrating articular retention periods extending beyond one month [ 128 169 The translational pathway presents additional hurdles: undefined cGMP standards for responsive hydrogels, technical–economic challenges in scaling complex formulations (e.g., gene-editing hydrogels), and a lack of regulatory frameworks for evaluating smart microenvironment-responsive systems. Critical knowledge gaps remain in long-term (≥12 month) biocompatibility assessment and standardized preclinical models. These challenges demand intensified collaboration between academia, industry, and regulators to establish clear development pathways. The future development of hydrogels should focus on multifunctional systems integrating nanomaterials, bioactive molecules, or gene-editing tools, although their complexity raises scale-up and regulatory challenges. Smart hydrogels with stimuli-responsive components enable precise drug release but require rigorous quality control, while combination approaches with cell/gene therapies demand novel regulatory frameworks. Emerging formulations like peptide gels and 3D-printed implants are expanding therapeutic applications despite the translational hurdles [ 179 Currently, few hydrogel formulations specifically target rheumatoid arthritis (RA), unlike osteoarthritis, largely due to RA’s systemic nature requiring broader immune modulation. An exception is repository corticotropin injection (Acthar ® NCT02919761 NCT03511625 NCT03082573 NCT02434757 NCT01966718 180 Although RA is a systemic disease, localized hydrogel therapies offer distinct advantages such as targeted delivery, reduced systemic toxicity, and potential for combination with immunomodulators. Nevertheless, formulation standardization remains challenging. These innovations hold promise for bridging the gap between localized delivery and systemic therapeutic needs in RA management, complementing existing biologics and small-molecule therapies, and thereby further expanding the therapeutic potential of hydrogels.
