Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continues to be a major global public health issue. In the early stages of the epidemic, the occurrence of cancer in people living with HIV (PLWH) was frequent and led to the definition of a subgroup of neoplasms called AIDS-defining cancers (ADC), including Kaposi’s sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) significantly changed the clinical course of HIV, drastically reducing the incidence of ADCs, increasing the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients, and leading to a parallel rise in non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) [ 1 2 3 4 5 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design A retrospective observational study (cross sectional prevalence analysis) was conducted on PLWH attending the HIV/AIDS Division at Ferrara Hospital, Italy, with an observation period between January 2023 and November 2024, covering a total duration of 23 months ( Figure A1 2.2. Study Objectives: • To assess the prevalence of oncological diseases among PLWH attending at the HIV/AIDS Division, in Ferrara. • To evaluate the prevalence of ADCs and NADCs among patients with cancer diagnosis. • To examine the correlation between the occurrence of ADCs and NADCs and variables such as age, sex assigned at birth, CDC clinical-prognostic classification, duration of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy, HIV viral load, lymphocyte subset analysis, serological markers, and lifestyle-related risk factors (e.g., smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and drug use). 2.3. Inclusion Criteria: • Age ≥ 18 years • Documented diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 • Any nationality • Laboratory follow-up during the study period 2.4. Exclusion Criteria: Age < 18 years Absence of routine laboratory monitoring during the observation period Lack of available data concerning the study variables 2.5. Data Collection and Analysis Data were extracted from clinical records and digitized into a database. Information included age, sex assigned at birth, nationality, CDC classification, HIV duration, antiretroviral therapy (drug classes), viral load, lymphocyte typing, cancer diagnoses (ADCs and NADCs throughout the patient’s entire period of affiliation with the Center), and serology for current or past infections by hepatitis viruses, herpesviruses, high-risk HPV, Toxoplasma gondii, and Treponema pallidum. Information on smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and drug use was self-reported by the patients. Plasma HIV RNA levels were quantified from venous blood samples using the Real-Time PCR assay routinely performed at the Provincial Central Laboratory of Ferrara Hospital (cut-off 20 copies/mL). Lymphocyte subset typing and serological testing were also conducted at the same laboratory, in accordance with its standard procedures. Instrumental diagnostics and imaging studies were performed at the Radiology department using ordinary methodologies. The continuous variable viral load was recoded as a dichotomous variable using a cut-off of 50 copies/mL (<50 copies/mL: virological suppression; ≥50 copies/mL: lack of suppression), whereas CD4+ T lymphocyte count was classified into three categories (>500 cells/μL: immunological stabilization post-ARV; <200 cells/μL: poor immunological control; intermediate values: partial response). Latency between HIV diagnosis and ADC onset was expressed as median (IQR) due to skewed data distribution, whereas latency for NADCs was expressed as mean (±SD) given the approximately normal and homogeneous distribution. Statistical analysis was performed using standard software (SPSS version 29 and G*Power 3.1), employing Fisher’s exact test and Chi-square test to compare groups. 3. Results Of the 682 patients initially enrolled, the analysis was conducted on 534 individuals (78%), as 148 patients (22%) were deemed ineligible due to missing laboratory data, either because they were lost to follow-up or failed to attend scheduled follow-up visits. The analysis revealed a marked predominance of male individuals 68.5% (366/534), and those over the age of fifty 72.8% (389/534) with a mean age of 56 years and a median of 58 years. 58.9% (314/534) of patients had been living with HIV for less than 20 years, while the remaining 41.1% (220/534) had lived with it for 20 years or more. Virologically, 93.6% (500/534) of patients had a viral load below 50 copies/mL at their last follow-up, indicating good infection control; 77.5% (414/534) had a CD4+ lymphocyte count above 500/μL, further indicating immunological stabilization due to antiretroviral therapy. However, despite good viro-immunological control, 11.7% (63/534) of the sample had a cancer diagnosis ( Table A1 Table A2 Table A3 Table A4 Table A5 p 4. Discussion HIV infection represents one of the most significant global health challenges of recent decades, and if left untreated, it can progress to AIDS, an advanced clinical condition characterized by a critically low number of CD4+ T cells and the emergence of severe AIDS-related illnesses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma and certain forms of lymphoma. Our study provides compelling evidence for the urgent need to adopt a personalized medicine approach in the comprehensive care of PLWH. The traditional focus on AIDS-defining cancers is no longer sufficient. This evolving reality demands a holistic and tailored strategy that moves beyond generic screening guidelines. While standard protocols are a good starting point, they fail to account for the unique and multifaceted risk pro-files of individual PLWH. By leveraging key clinical data, including patient age, immune status, viral load, and the presence of coinfections like HBV and HCV, we can precisely identify individuals at elevated risk for specific malignancies. This granular understanding is crucial because it allows for the development of customized cancer prevention pathways that are far more effective than a one-size-fits-all approach. These personalized pathways would ensure that screening for specific conditions is prioritized for the patients who need it most. The introduction of the Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy has radically transformed the clinical landscape, leading to a marked decline in the prevalence of AIDS-related diseases and a significant increase in life expectancy among HIV-positive individuals. However, this progress has contributed to a rise in the prevalence of malignancies, particularly non-AIDS-defining cancers, which now account for an increasing share of the cancer burden among PLWH. The most recent epidemiological data, including those collected in our study, confirm a well-established trend in the scientific literature: non-AIDS-defining cancers are now more frequent than AIDS-defining cancers, both in absolute and relative terms [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 5. Conclusions This study confirms the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in reducing AIDS-defining cancers, while highlighting the growing prevalence of non-AIDS-defining cancers in PLWH. These findings reflect the impact of longer survival, exposing patients to cancer risk factors common in the general population, exacerbated by immunosenescence and coinfections, which plausibly contribute. There is a pressing need to develop cancer screening strategies specifically for PLWH to promote early diagnosis and improve prognosis. However, the complexity of diagnostic and therapeutic pathways involving multiple specialists can be challenging for patients, particularly due to ongoing stigma associated with HIV. This research, as the first publication of its kind for the Ferrara area, would be a highly significant contribution to the field of public health, especially in the local context. Based on this work, the Center is currently investigating structured and facilitated screening pathways for major cancer conditions in people living with HIV who receive care at the facility, in collaboration with other hospital and community services. Creating accessible, integrated, and personalized screening pathways is a key strategy to overcome these barriers, accelerate early cancer detection, and significantly improve clinical outcomes for the HIV-positive population. Ultimately, a unified registry of oncological pathologies (with anonymous data) would move the healthcare system from a reactive, fragmented approach to a proactive, evidence-based strategy, leading to more effective early cancer detection and improved care for the entire PLWH community. In the context of personalized medicine, this study is a vital step forward. The findings underscore the need to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare. By creating structured and personalized cancer screening pathways, this research recognizes the unique biological vulnerabilities, such as immunosenescence and coinfections, and the psychosocial challenges, like stigma, faced by people living with HIV. This proactive, tailored strategy is crucial for optimizing early diagnosis and significantly improving both the quality of life and clinical outcomes for each individual patient.
