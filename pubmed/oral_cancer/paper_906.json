Introduction Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) can initially be managed effectively through androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); however, the majority of patients eventually develop castrate resistance [ 1 2 3 4 With the expansion of the treatment choices for CRPC, there is a growing need for accurate survival predictions to optimize the treatment sequencing. However, the traditional statistical methods fail to take into account the nonlinear and multidimensional associations between biological factors in CRPC and the multitude of sequenced therapies during each landscape of the disease. Studies have explored prognostic models regarding OS predictions for patients with CRPC [ 5 5 ML has recently gained popularity in survival predictions due to its capacity to process complex and high-dimensional datasets, enabling highly accurate predictive modeling. Compared to the traditional statistical approaches, such as Cox proportional hazards models or Kaplan–Meier analysis, ML methods have demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving numerous variables. Studies across various cancer types have reported that ML models can achieve predictive accuracies ranging from approximately 70% to 90% and root mean square errors below 20 in regression-based survival analyses [ 6 7 This study aimed to develop and compare multiple ML models for predicting the survival time before cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM) and the 2-year and 3-year survival status after a CRPC diagnosis by utilizing a comprehensive set of demographical and clinicopathological variables. We sought to identify the most accurate and reliable ML model for guiding clinical decision-making. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Collection Clinical, laboratory, and pathological data comprising 46 variables at the time of the initial PCa diagnosis and at the time of progression to CRPC were retrospectively collected from 801 consecutive patients diagnosed with CRPC at two institutions from January 2005 to February 2022. CRPC was defined according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria. Patients were excluded if their clinical data were incomplete, if their treatment deviated from the standard recommendations, or if cause of death or survival status could not be identified. Data on CRPC treatments were collected, including the type of therapeutic agent (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, docetaxel, and olaparib) and the durations of the first, second, and third lines of treatment until disease progression. The sequence of administered agents was determined at the physician’s discretion and according to patient preference. The treatment regimens included intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 2 Survival status and cause of death were determined using data from the National Cancer Registry Database or institutional medical records. Deaths were attributed to CRPC if there was documented progression of metastatic CRPC or if death resulted from treatment-related complications. 2.2. The Study Endpoints The primary endpoint of this study was to develop ML models predicting CSM, OM, and 2-year and 3-year survival status following the diagnosis of CRPC. The secondary study endpoint was to evaluate the discriminative performance and calibration of the developed models. 2.3. Statistical Analyses 2.3.1. Data Processing To prepare the dataset, key variables were derived, including the time interval (months) between the CRPC diagnosis and either death or the last follow-up; %PSA changes from the initial PCa diagnosis to the initiation of ADT; durations and %PSA changes between PCa diagnosis and ADT initiation; risk group stratification based on the LATTITUDE (high-risk) and CHAARTED (high-volume) criteria; and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. To classify the survival outcomes, 2-year survival status and 3-year survival status after a CRPC diagnosis were encoded as binary variables. Missing data were addressed using imputation methods based on the type of variable. For numeric variables, missing values were imputed using multiple iterative imputations with Bayesian ridge regression and mean-based strategies. For categorical variables, imputation was performed using the most frequent category. Cases with missing outcome data were excluded from the analysis. The final dataset was randomized into training and validation sets using an 80:20 split for cross-validation. 2.3.2. Model Development Survival periods and binary survival status were predicted using both regression and classification approaches. In the regression models, the target variable was survival time in months after CRPC diagnosis. In the classification models, binary outcomes represented the 2-year and 3-year survival status. Regression models were developed using a Cox proportional hazard analysis, random survival forests (RSFs), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The classification models were developed using logistic regression, Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), XGBoost, and random forest algorithms. The best-performing model in each category was selected as the final predictive model. Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 2.3.3. Model Performance Interpretation Regression models, which generate survival time predictions, were evaluated using Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) to assess their discriminative performance. For the classification models, which produced the categorical survival status predictions, their performance was evaluated using accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), mean precision, mean recall, and F1-score. To enhance interpretability, the final models were analyzed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework. SHAP quantifies the contribution of each input variable to the model predictions, enabling an understanding of the feature importance behind individual predictions. 2.4. Ethical Considerations This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Yonsei University Health System (approval number: 3-2016-0190) following a review of the study protocol. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (1946) and its most recent revision in 2008. 3. Results 3.1. Patient Characteristics The baseline demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients at the time of the initial PCa diagnosis and at progression to CRPC are presented in Table 1 Supplementary Table S3 The 2-year and 3-year cancer-specific survival rates were 18.7% and 13.5%, respectively, while the 2-year and 3-year overall survival rates were 17.7% and 13.0% ( Table 2 8 Figure 1 Comparisons between groups were performed using Welch’s t p 3.2. Comparison of Model Performance Table 3 However, in the test set, RSFs outperformed all of the other models, achieving the highest C-index for both CSM (0.772, 95% CI 0.707–0.837) and OM (0.771, 95% CI 0.706–0.836). XGB ranked third, with C-indices of 0.753 (95% CI 0.686–0.820) for CSM and 0.765 (95% CI 0.699–0.831) for OM, respectively. This indicated a tendency toward overfitting, as the test score was lower than the validation score. From a model generalizability perspective, RSFs appeared to offer a more robust and reliable performance across datasets. For 2-year survival predictions, the RSF model achieved the best overall performance as follows: accuracy: 0.750; AUC: 0.820; recall: 0.787; mean precision: 0.744; F1-score: 0.764 ( Table 4 3.3.

Discussion The quality of the data preparation plays a critical role in the performance of ML algorithms, especially in CRPC survival predictions, where the outcomes are influenced by a complex interplay between clinical and biological factors. The key strength of our study is the use of the largest and most comprehensive CRPC dataset to date, incorporating 46 clinical, laboratory, and pathological variables, spanning the full disease landscape, from an initial PCa diagnosis to death. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a multi-model ML-based approach to survival prediction specifically in patients with CRPC, representing a significant step forward in precise prognostication. While numerous studies have explored survival prediction in PCa, they have largely focused on localized disease, often utilizing deep learning models trained on large and relatively homogeneous patient populations [ 9 10 By incorporating a broad range of input variables and comparing multiple ML algorithms, we demonstrated that survival predictions for CRPC can be significantly improved over those of the traditional statistical methods. Our top-performing models achieved C-indices of 0.772 for CSM and 0.771 for OM in the test set, substantially higher than the C-index of 0.67 reported by Moreira et al., who utilized Cox proportional hazard models to predict the OM in a smaller dataset of 205 patients and 14 variables [ 11 Saito et al. reported ML-based survival prediction models for PCa patients treated with ADT, achieving a C-index of 0.74 using an RSF. Although their survival tree model achieved a higher C-index of 0.85 in metastatic PCa patients, it lacked generalizability to non-metastatic cases [ 12 In our analysis, XGBoost demonstrated a higher performance in the validation set; however, it showed a relative decline in the test set, indicating a tendency toward overfitting. This reflects a limitation of XGBoost, which may capture noise or idiosyncrasies in the training set rather than generalizable prognostic patterns. Overfitting not only diminishes the predictive stability but may also restrict the clinical utility when models are applied to external populations. To mitigate this issue, we applied several strategies, including hyperparameter optimization using grid search within a 10-fold cross-validation framework; the application of regularization parameters (e.g., L1 and L2) embedded within algorithms such as XGBoost and LightGBM; and an evaluation of the model’s generalizability through a performance assessment on an independent test set. Additional approaches, such as stricter regularization, early stopping to prevent over-training, or dimensionality reduction by prioritizing features with stronger prognostic value, could be considered in future studies to reduce the risk of overfitting further. To balance accuracy with generalizability, RSFs and LightGBM were combined with XGBoost as a hybrid approach. Ultimately, the most critical step would be external validation on independent cohorts, which would confirm the robustness and support the generalizability of the models. A key advantage of our approach is the integration of SHAP, which improved the interpretability of our ML models by quantifying the individual contribution of each input variable. Among the top-ranked predictors for both CSM and OM were the time interval from CRPC diagnosis to the initiation of first-line systemic therapy and baseline hemoglobin and ALP levels at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Notably, traditional prognostic indicators such as age, Gleason grade, and baseline PSA contributed minimally to the models, indicating a shift in prognostic relevance toward more dynamic, treatment-related, and biochemical variables in the advanced-disease setting. These findings are consistent with the existing clinical literature. Prior studies have identified anemia and elevated or rapidly increasing ALP levels as strong, independent predictors of a poor prognosis in mCRPC, particularly in large cohorts treated with docetaxel or cabazitaxel [ 13 14 15 16 17 Several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the absence of an external validation cohort limits the generalizability of our results. Second, our dataset spans an 18-year period (2005–2022) during which substantial advancements in the systemic therapies for CRPC occurred. During this period, novel agents such as androgen-receptor-axis targeted therapies (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide), cabazitaxel, and various combination or sequential strategies were gradually introduced. These therapeutic shifts may have significantly influenced the survival outcomes and consequently affected the predictive performance of our models. Era-based sensitivity analyses to account for temporal heterogeneity were considered; however, the irregular timing of therapeutic changes and resultant heterogeneity within subgroups limited the feasibility and statistical reliability of such analyses. Finally, recently approved agents not represented in our cohort, including darolutamide, pembrolizumab, and rucaparib, may impact survival outcomes further. Incorporating these therapies into future studies, along with external validation using contemporary cohorts, will be essential to enhance the predictive accuracy, clinical relevance, and generalizability of our models. 5. Conclusions Using a large, comprehensive dataset and multiple ML algorithms, we demonstrated that XGBoost and RSFs can substantially outperform the traditional statistical methods in predicting the CSM and OM in patients with CRPC. Importantly, the application of SHAP improved the model interpretability by identifying clinically meaningful prognostic factors, which may support individualized treatment planning. Future studies should focus on model refinement, the incorporation of emerging therapeutic agents, and external validation to ensure broad clinical applicability and translation into real-world practice.
