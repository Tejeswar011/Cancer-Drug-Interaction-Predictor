However, IVDs are susceptible to degeneration (IVDD) due to age, excessive strain, and genetic factors, resulting in bulging or herniation that causes pain, stiffness, and nerve compression. Current Treatments Current treatments primarily focus on symptom management through medication, physical therapy, or surgery in severe cases, without addressing tissue repair. Emerging Therapies Exosome therapy has recently emerged as a promising regenerative approach for IVDD. Exosomes are small, membrane-bound vesicles released by cells, acting as messengers to transport proteins and RNA that influence recipient cell behavior. Potential and Challenges Researchers are investigating exosomes for IVDD because they may promote disc repair and regeneration by delivering molecules that stimulate tissue recovery and carry anti-inflammatory agents to reduce inflammation and modulate pain. Engineering strategies, such as loading exosomes with therapeutic cargo or targeting molecules, can further enhance their efficacy. While exosome therapy for IVDD is still in early research stages, ongoing studies are promising, though challenges remain in optimizing isolation methods and ensuring clinical safety. Conclusion Exosome-based therapies could offer a safe, effective, and minimally invasive solution for individuals affected by IVDD.

Humans have 23 discs: six cervical, twelve thoracic, and five lumbar [ 1 2 3 Any disturbances in these normal functions of the disc cause intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). It leads to a cascade of structural and biochemical changes significantly impacting spinal health. The degeneration is characterized by loss of hydration, cell death, and altered mechanical properties, which can result in pain and disability in the disc. The following sections outline the key consequences of IVDD [ 4 5 6 Etiology of intervertebral disorders IVDD results from a complex interplay of various factors disrupting the balance between extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation [ 7 8 9 Mechanical overload and structural compromise Chronic mechanical overload from heavy lifting or poor posture causes tears in the AF and dehydration of the NP, weakening IVDs and increasing pain vulnerability with age [ 10 . TLR4, TLR2, TNFα NGF 11 12 The role of genetics Genetic predisposition significantly influences IVDD, with studies identifying specific genes and markers linked to increased risk through heritability. These genes encode proteins crucial for maintaining a healthy disc matrix, such as collagens ( COL11A1, COL1A1 13 14 Inflammation In healthy IVDs, resident disc cells and infiltrating immune cells, such as monocytes and dendritic cells, maintain homeostasis by producing inflammatory mediators like TNFA and IL-1β [ 15 16 This highlights the importance of resolving inflammation effectively, as it can contribute to the development of painful conditions like those arising from degenerated discs [ 17 18 Current treatment options for IVDD Current therapies for IVD diseases involve a combination of non-surgical methods, surgical methods, and biological and cellular therapies. These methods include the following: Medications Analgesics, muscle relaxants, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which reduce pain and inflammation, are typically recommended for short-term use. Exercise, heat/cold therapy, acupuncture, massage, hydrotherapy, and shock waves are advised for chronic pain. For faster recovery, steroids are usually considered alongside other treatments. Physical therapy improves disc flexibility and strengthens muscles, reducing discomfort and swelling. Injection therapy, often the first choice due to its minimally invasive nature, delivers targeted pain relief and involves delivering medication directly into a specific location within the body using a needle and syringe. corticosteroidal injections are generally used and injected into the epidural space for it to reach the inflamed tissue. This approach eases discomfort but may not fully address the root cause [ 19 Surgical methods When conservative therapy fails, surgery offers a definitive solution, but traditional approaches can be disruptive. Minimally invasive endoscopic techniques are emerging as a promising alternative [ 20 21 22 Cell therapy To promote healing and lessen discomfort, this method entails infusing cells such as MSCs, pluripotent stem cell-derived cells, and IVD-derived stem cells intradiscally into the damaged disc. MSCs, a promising cell therapy for IVDD, may promote tissue repair and pain relief, although their exact mechanism remains unclear [ 23 24 25 15 Biomaterials This involves implanting a biocompatible material into the affected disc to promote healing and reduce pain. Hydrogels are gaining interest for IVDD due to their biocompatibility, injectability, and ability to support disc cell growth while allowing customization and incorporation of bioactive substances for tissue repair. Clinical trials in the past three decades have been done on scaffold-based injectable therapies to reverse the symptoms of IVDD [ 26 27 26 Gene therapy Gene therapy is a promising early-stage IVDD treatment, modifying disc cell genes to increase the production of molecules essential for disc repair, directly targeting the root cause. For instance, SOX9 SOX9 28 29 30 Exosome origins, therapeutic applications, and mechanisms of action Exosomes, nanosized vesicles derived from various cells like mesenchymal and neural stem cells, and other sources like mentioned in Fig. 1 31 32 Fig. 1 Sources of exosomes and their associated cell sizes in relation to exosome dimensions. Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesicles ranging from 30 to 150 nm, are secreted by various cell types and play a crucial role in intercellular communication. This figure illustrates the diverse biological sources of exosomes, including adipose stem cells (15–30 µm), neural stem cells (10–20 µm), umbilical cord cells (15–25 µm), nucleus pulposus cells (10–20 µm), platelets (2–3 µm), bone marrow stem cells (15–30 µm), placental cells (15–30 µm), and endometrial cells (10–30 µm). The inclusion of cell sizes provides context for understanding the relative scale difference between the originating cells and the exosomes they produce, emphasizing the nanoscale size of exosomes compared to their parent cells. This comparison underscores the precision and efficiency of exosome-mediated signaling despite their small size relative to the source cells. (made from Biorender) Moreover, the source-dependent functionality of exosomes opens doors to personalized medicine, as exosomes exert their therapeutic effects through specific molecular pathways tailored by their cell of origin. For example, miRNAs like miR-146a and miR-181 carried by MSC exosomes suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNFA) while enhancing M2 macrophage polarization [ 33 STK4 YY1 34 2 35 Fig. 2 This schematic illustrates how exosomes derived from various cell types-including nucleus pulposus cells, notochordal cells, and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, and placenta-modulate key processes in IVDD. Through delivery of miRNAs and proteins, these exosomes regulate extracellular matrix homeostasis, inhibit apoptosis, reduce inflammation, suppress ER stress, and promote regeneration of disc cells, collectively contributing to the attenuation of IVDD progression and offering promising therapeutic potential.

These MVBs bulge inwards, creating tiny pockets filled with cellular cargo. Eventually, the MVB fuses with the cell's outer membrane, releasing the exosomes into the surrounding environment [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 3 44 46 Fig. 3 The figure depicts exosome biogenesis, highlighting the formation and encapsulation of miRNAs. The process begins with endocytosis, followed by the formation of early and late endosomes, which mature into multivesicular bodies. These bodies then release exosomes containing specific miRNAs, such as miR-145 and miR-532-5p, which target IVDD. (made from Biorender) Research shows that EVs from expanded human umbilical cord blood CD133 + cells and bone marrow MSCs can induce angiogenesis and migration, highlighting their therapeutic potential [ 47 48 YY1 STK4 34 The next generation of exosome therapy shows promise for targeted treatments, as modified exosomes can be engineered to release higher concentrations of therapeutic agents. For instance, engineered exosomes fused with drug-loaded thermosensitive liposomes demonstrated significant drug release under laser irradiation, enhancing cancer treatment efficacy [ 49 50 1 Table 1 List of animal studies on Exosomes derived from different cellular sources, their pathway, and their therapeutic effect Cellular source of exosomes Mode of action Therapeutic effect References Umbilical cord derived MSCs Reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFA, IL-1β, and IL-6 Downregulation in the expression of MMP13 and ADAMTS5 in chondrocytes Promotion of Regeneration of Articular Cartilage in Rat Models of Osteoarthritis (OA) [ 51 Adipose tissue derived MSCs Inhibition of inflammatory pathways like the NLRP3 inflammasome, reducing cell death and promoting neuronal survival Improved spinal cord injury (SCI) repair in animal models by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation [ 52 MSCs Exosomes loaded with PTEN siRNA promote axonal regeneration and functional recovery after complete spinal cord injury by inhibiting PTEN, which activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and reduces inflammation in the injured area In mice, delivery of MSC-derived exosomes loaded with PTEN siRNA significantly enhanced motor function following complete SCI compared to control groups [ 53 Pericytes Pericyte-derived exosomes maintain blood-spinal cord barrier integrity, reduce inflammation by modulating apoptotic factors, and regulate hypoxia-inducible factors, promoting recovery after spinal cord injury Improved microcirculation and protection of the blood-spinal cord barrier following SCI in mice leading to improved motor control [ 54 Human placenta-derived MSCs Promotion of angiogenesis and neuroprotection by delivering growth factors that enhance endothelial cell function, improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, and facilitate recovery after spinal cord injury Significant improvements in neurological function following SCI in mice models. The treatment led to enhanced motor recovery and reduced neurological deficits [ 55 Human placenta-derived MSCs Human placenta MSC-derived exosomes can activate endogenous neurogenesis, which involves the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells to replace damaged neurons and promote functional recovery after SCI Significant improvement in functional recovery and enhanced activation of endogenous neurogenesis following SCI in animal models [ 56 Adipose tissue-derived MSCs Exosomes derived from these cells inhibit matrix metalloproteinases and promote collagen II synthesis, improving ECM balance in degenerating discs Improved disc height and reduced degeneration in a rat model of IVDD [ 57 MSCs Exosomes deliver miRNAs that modulate endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, reducing apoptosis and promoting the survival of NPCs, thereby ameliorating IVD degeneration Protection of NPCs from apoptosis, promoting survival, and ameliorating IVDD progression in a rat model [ 58 CEP derived stem cells CESC-derived exosomes activate the Akt signaling pathway in NPCs, enhancing autophagy and reducing apoptosis, which protects against degeneration and promotes cellular health in IVDs Inhibition of IVDD in rats by protecting NPCs from apoptosis and promoting their survival [ 59 BMSCs Promote autophagy in NPCs, inhibit inflammatory factors like IL-1β and TNFA, and suppress apoptosis through the Akt-mTOR pathway Alleviation of IVD degeneration in rat models by enhancing NPCs survival and reducing inflammation [ 60 Exosomes in clinical application for IVDD Exosomes, tiny cellular messengers, have emerged as a promising therapeutic avenue for IVDD in preclinical studies. However, translating this promise into real-world patient care remains a hurdle. While research suggests their potential, clinical applications of exosomes for IVDD are still in their early stages. Highlighting the limited clinical translation, there has only been one documented clinical trial using exosomes for IVDD treatment so far. Fortunately, the field is not stagnant. Currently, there is a controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial that has been completed in India for which the results are yet to be published. This trial investigates the efficacy of exosome therapy for IVDD. This phase 1 clinical trial ( NCT04849429 61 62 In a promising development for IVDD treatment, researchers investigated the therapeutic potential of exosomes derived from BMSCs. Their study suggests that BMSC-exosomes may offer a novel strategy to halt the progression of IVDD. The researchers found that BMSC-exosomes are enriched with a specific circular RNA molecule, circ_0050205. This circular RNA appears to promote the survival of vital cells within the disc NPCs and suppress the degradation of the ECM, a key structural component. By supporting NPC health and maintaining disc integrity, BMSC-exosomes loaded with circ_0050205 have the potential to impede IVDD progression, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for future research [ 63 Role of exosomes in disc homeostasis Exosomes are involved in rescuing IVDD and are crucial in preserving disc homeostasis [ 64 65 66 4 Fig. 4 Schematic representation of the role of exosomes from various sources in IVD homeostasis and degeneration. Exosomes deliver miRNAs to NP cells, ECM synthesis and inhibiting its degradation. Under mechanical load and inflammatory conditions, exosomes modulate immune responses, suppress vascularization, and reduce macrophage infiltration, thereby preserving the immune privilege of the disc. These processes help maintain normal IVD structure and function, highlighting the therapeutic potential of exosome-based approaches for preventing or reversing disc degeneration.

Fragmented materials are transported via the lysosomal/exosomal secretory pathway, where lysosomes degrade waste and exosomes expel specific products, maintaining cellular homeostasis by efficiently eliminating debris. Exosomes enhance autophagy in the disc by improving the intracellular vesicular system and regulating the environment, stimulating the Akt-mTOR pathway to maintain homeostasis in NPCs [ 67 68 69 70 Inhibiting inflammatory response pathways Exosomes play a crucial role in regulating inflammation associated with IVDD by modulating proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines in disc cells. They act as transporters of soluble mediators, influencing TLR cascades and NF-κB pathways, thus affecting immune responses. Exosomes contain various RNA species, including mRNAs and noncoding regulatory RNAs, which can regulate inflammatory pathways. Their release may reduce immune responses, contributing to disc homeostasis and preventing degeneration. [ 37 71 65 Promoting extracellular matrix synthesis Exosomes act as messengers in the IVD, promoting the production of type II collagen and aggrecan, essential for maintaining healthy disc structure. They deliver bioactive cargo like miRNAs, proteins, and transcription factors, influencing gene expression and cellular processes in IVD cells [ 57 72 Additionally, Exosomes are known to prevent apoptosis, stimulate anti-inflammatory responses, and inhibit matrix degradation, supporting ECM preservation in the IVD. They also influence gene transcription, impacting cell division and survival, essential for ECM production and maintenance [ 73 74 75 76 Exosome therapy and translational research In a significant advancement for IVDD therapy, a recent study explored the potential of cartilage end plate stem cells (CESCs) for disc repair. It showed that CESCs can transdifferentiate into NPCs, vital for IVD health, through autocrine exosomes. These exosomes promote CESC migration and transformation into functional NPCs, highlighting the potential of using a patient's own stem cells and exosomes for regenerating damaged disc tissue [ 77 78 79 80 66 81 Chen et al. used an in vitro model simulating the acidic microenvironment of IVDD to study BMSC-exosome on human NPCs. BMSC-exosome enhanced NPCs viability under acidic stress and reduced apoptosis markers, indicating a protective effect against cell death. These findings support further investigation of BMSC-exosome for promoting NPC survival in IVDD's acidic environment [ 82 83 84 Role of exosomes as a delivery vehicle Exosomes in their natural form hold immense promise as a cell-free therapeutic approach for various diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), IVDD, OA, wound healing, etc. These tiny messengers boast several advantages: excellent biocompatibility, minimal toxicity, and low immune system activation. However, they can be employed independently or combined with other therapies for enhanced efficacy. Exosomes are capable of delivering some miRNAs to NPCs, annulus fibrosus, and cartilage endplate cells, thereby modulating essential cellular processes linked to IVDD. These processes include inhibition of apoptosis of NPCs, promotion of cell proliferation and ECM synthesis, inhibition of inflammatory responses by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome activation, and restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis and reduction of oxidative stress in NPCs [ 46 85 86 87 88 89 57 5 90 Fig. 5 Exosome engineering strategies for IVDD therapy. The depicted strategies include: (1) direct loading of exosomes with therapeutic cargo, such as nucleic acids or proteins, enabling targeted delivery of specific molecules; (2) inducing mutations in cells to produce engineered exosomes with enhanced therapeutic properties; (3) loading exosomes into biomaterials for sustained release and localized delivery; (4) fusion of functional lipid molecules to engineer the exosome membrane for improved targeting and drug delivery; and (5) direct injection of engineered exosomes for minimally invasive IVDD therapy. (made from Biorender) Challenges in exosome therapy Exosome therapy for IVDD faces several challenges that must be addressed for effective clinical application. Currently, the therapy is in its early stages, with limited clinical data on its efficacy and safety, complicating the transition to human trials [ 91 92 93 94 Engineered exosomes and future prospects Recent advancements in exosome engineering have opened new avenues for targeted delivery of therapeutics, particularly in the context of IVDD. One of the most important factors in the optimization of exosome therapies is the method by which therapeutic molecules are loaded into exosomes. Passive loading techniques, such as incubation and freeze–thaw cycles, rely on natural diffusion or membrane permeability to deliver bioactive molecules like miRNAs or small molecules into exosomes. While simple and comparatively non-disruptive, these methods have lower loading efficiency. In contrast, active loading techniques, including sonication, electroporation, and extrusion, enhance membrane permeability to achieve higher cargo encapsulation efficiencies. For instance, electroporation was used to load siRNAs into exosomes for gene silencing applications, while extrusion has demonstrated higher efficiency for the encapsulation of small molecules like paclitaxel into MSC-derived exosomes [ 95 96 95 96 97 98 80 99 2 99 100 Table 2 Comparison of Exosome therapy with conventional therapies Feature Exosome therapy Cell therapy Gene therapy Medications Mechanism of action Delivers bioactive molecules for cell growth, repair, and inflammation modulation Introduces stem cells for direct tissue regeneration Modifies the genetic makeup of cells for therapeutic protein production Primarily targets symptoms like pain and inflammation Minimally invasive Often involves injection into the disc space Requires cell isolation, expansion, and injection May involve viral vectors or complex delivery methods Typically oral or topical administration Immunogenicity Generally low due to minimal cellular material Potential for immune response to foreign cells Potential for immune response to viral vectors or modified genes Varies depending on the medication Scalability Easier to isolate and scale up exosome production compared to cell expansion Scaling up cell production can be time-consuming and expensive Gene therapy technology is still under development for large-scale production Mass production is generally feasible Targeted effects Can deliver specific molecules to target various cellular processes Cell differentiation and function within the disc environment can be unpredictable Gene targeting can be precise but may have unintended consequences Primarily targets specific symptoms Long-term effects Potential for sustained therapeutic effects through delivered molecules Cell survival and functionality within the disc may diminish over time Gene therapy could offer permanent correction, but long-term safety needs monitoring Effectiveness may diminish over time, requiring repeated administration Summary This review explores the potential of exosome therapy as a novel treatment for IVDD. IVDs are essential for spinal support and mobility but are prone to degeneration due to age, strain, and genetic factors, leading to pain and disability. Traditional treatments primarily focus on pain management, while exosome therapy offers a regenerative approach by utilizing small vesicles that transport proteins and RNA to stimulate tissue repair and reduce inflammation. It is highlighted that exosomes derived from MSCs can promote the regeneration of NPCs and maintain homeostasis within the disc environment. Despite the promising therapeutic potential, there are challenges such as optimizing isolation methods, ensuring safety, and scaling production for clinical use. There is an urgent need for further research to address these hurdles and explore the engineering of exosomes for targeted delivery. Overall, this innovative therapy could lead to effective, minimally invasive treatments for IVDD, enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.
