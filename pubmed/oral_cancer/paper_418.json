Inadequate management of acute postoperative pain not only reduces patient satisfaction and delays recovery but also increases the risk of developing chronic pain. Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is a widely used technique for perioperative pain management. However, even with the use of long-acting local anaesthetics, such as ropivacaine, postoperative analgesia often remains insufficient. Preliminary evidence suggests that combining diprospan, a mixture of betamethasone disodium phosphate and betamethasone dipropionate, with ropivacaine can significantly reduce analgesic requirements in the immediate postoperative period. However, concerns about steroid-related complications, including hyperglycaemia and surgical site infections, highlight the need to identify the minimum diprospan concentration to achieve a balance between efficacy and safety. This randomised, controlled, evaluator-blinded trial aims to investigate the dose-response relationship of diprospan as an adjunct to ropivacaine for LIA in spinal surgery to determine the minimum effective dose for effective and safe pain management. Methods and analysis This is a single-centre, randomised, evaluator-blinded, controlled, dose-mapping study in which subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to the control group or to receive diprospan at concentrations of 0.003%, 0.006%, 0.009% or 0.012%. Patients will receive either 0.5% ropivacaine alone or a corresponding dose of diprospan combined with 0.5% ropivacaine for LIA. All participants will be followed for a duration of 3 months. The primary outcome measure will be cumulative sufentanil consumption within the first 48 hours postsurgery. Secondary outcomes will include additional assessments of analgesia, steroid-related adverse events and other complications within the 3-month follow-up period. Ethics and dissemination This study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Beijing Tiantan Hospital (KY2024-365-02-1). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Dose-mapping approach to determine the minimum effective dose of diprospan. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Centralised randomisation procedure. Strict blinding procedure. Background Postoperative pain is a common clinical issue that is often underestimated. Numerous studies have shown that despite advancements in pain management, a significant number of patients continue to experience moderate to severe pain following surgery. 1 2 3 4 5 Postoperative pain primarily arises from inflammatory reactions in the tissues surrounding the surgical site, direct nerve damage and nociceptive sensitisation caused by the activation of central and peripheral nerves. 1 6 7 8 9 Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is a simple, safe and effective method widely used in clinical practice and can avoid the adverse reactions associated with systemic medication. However, in longer surgical procedures, preincisional LIA with ropivacaine or other long-acting local anaesthetics provides effective intraoperative anaesthesia but only short-lasting postoperative analgesia. Even when LIA is administered prior to wound closure, its postoperative analgesic effect remains limited by the short duration of action of the local anaesthetic. 10 12 Diprospan is a glucocorticoid formulation that contains a mixture of betamethasone disodium phosphate and betamethasone dipropionate. Betamethasone disodium phosphate is highly soluble in water, allowing for rapid absorption and a faster onset of action. 13 12 Our previous study demonstrated that a pre-emptive LIA using 0.5% ropivacaine combined with 0.012% diprospan reduced cumulative analgesic requirements over the first 48 hours by 57.7% compared with ropivacaine alone in spinal surgery. In addition, the previous study showed that the use of diprospan LIA reduces postoperative pain scores, improves patient satisfaction and prolongs the time to rescue analgesia, with statistically significant results. 14 15 16 17 18 19 The aim of this randomised, controlled, evaluator-blinded, dose-finding trial is to investigate the dose-response relationship of diprospan as an adjunct to ropivacaine for LIA around surgical incisions in spinal surgery. We will compare postoperative analgesic consumption, adverse events (AEs) and patient satisfaction across different diprospan concentrations to determine the minimum effective dose for LIA in spinal surgery. Methods Study design Patient and public involvement This is a single-centre, randomised, evaluator-blinded, controlled, dose-mapping study in which subjects will be entered into the control group, 0.003%, 0.006%, 0.009% and 0.012% diprospan groups on a 1:1:1:1:1 basis.

Allocation and blinding All participants will sign an informed consent form 1 day prior to surgery. The informed consent of this study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital ( online supplemental file 1 Intervention To prepare Diprospan at concentrations of 0.003%, 0.006%, 0.009% and 0.012%, 0.125 mL, 0.25 mL, 0.375 mL and 0.5 mL of diprospan will be diluted to 30 mL with 15 mL of ropivacaine in 0.9% NaCl, respectively. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of these four concentration groups or to the control group (0.5% ropivacaine alone). Randomisation will be performed in blocks of 535 patients (107 per group). The infiltration solution will be prepared by the same anaesthesiologist in a separate operating room to maintain consistency. Each study drug solution will be provided in identical syringes, labelled only with a letter, ensuring blinding. The surgeon will use a 22G straight needle for LIA near the planned incisions. 20 Anaesthesia induction and management At the preoperative visit, all patients enrolled in the study will sign an informed consent form and receive instructions on how to use the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump and assess pain severity using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). On entering the operating room, all patients will be continuously monitored for electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate (HR), peripheral pulse oximetry, partial pressure of end-expiratory carbon dioxide and electroencephalographic dual-frequency index (BIS system, Covidien/Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). An intravenous infusion of crystalloid solution will be initiated through a peripheral venous cannula, and a preoperative dose of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) will be administered. A standard general anaesthesia protocol will then be implemented. General anaesthesia will be induced using 0.3–0.4 µg/kg sufentanil, 1.5–2 mg/kg propofol and either 0.2 mg/kg cisatracurium or 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Following tracheal intubation, anaesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane at 0.4 minimum alveolar concentration, targeting BIS values between 40 and 60. A continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.1–0.3 µg/kg/min) will be administered until the conclusion of surgery, and neuromuscular blockade will be maintained using intravenous cisatracurium or rocuronium bromide. Ventilation parameters will be adjusted as needed to maintain normocapnia. Before surgical incision, the neurosurgeon will perform local infiltration with the allocated solution. Additional sufentanil will be administered as needed to maintain HR and/or mean arterial pressure fluctuations within 20% of baseline during surgery. No acetaminophen or other analgesics will be given intraoperatively. Dosages of all medications and intraoperative physiological parameters will be closely monitored and recorded by the investigator. For the reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade, intravenous atropine (0.01 mg/kg) and neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) will be administered postoperatively. Extubation will be performed once eye opening, adequate spontaneous respiration and purposeful movement are confirmed. Additionally, all patients will receive an intravenous dose of tropisetron hydrochloride (0.2 mg/kg, maximum dose 5 mg). Following tracheal extubation, patients will be transferred to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU). Patients will be discharged from the PACU to the surgical ward once they achieve a modified Aldrete score of ≥9 (0–10). 21 On arrival in the PACU, each patient will be connected to a PCA pump, containing 200 µg of sufentanil and 16 mg of ondansetron, diluted in saline to a total volume of 100 mL. The PCA device will be programmed to deliver 1 mL per dose, with a 10 min lockout interval, and a maximum dose of 8 µg per hour. The PCA will remain attached for 48 hours, with both the initial dose and background infusion rates set to zero. Patients will be instructed to press the analgesic demand button when their VAS score exceeds 4. Each PCA activation, including both valid and invalid attempts, will be electronically recorded. Ineffective attempts will be defined as presses made during the lockout period. If analgesia remains inadequate after four PCA demand button presses, rescue analgesia will be provided with oral Tylenol (Mallinckrodt), containing 5 mg oxycodone hydrochloride and 325 mg acetaminophen per tablet, with a minimum interval of 6 hours between doses. After 48 hours postoperatively, patients will receive oral loxoprofen (60 mg) as needed, with a minimum dosing interval of 8 hours and a maximum daily dose of 180 mg until discharge. If pain control remains insufficient, patients will be allowed to continue taking oral Tylenol as previously described until the end of the 3-month follow-up period. During the observation period, the following data will be recorded: the number of effective and ineffective PCA activations, total sufentanil consumption, and the dose and frequency of paracetamol and loxoprofen administration. The role of systemic glucocorticoids in improving spinal surgery outcomes remains controversial. 22 Study outcomes Primary outcomes Cumulative consumption of sufentanil by the PCA in the 48 hours postoperative period. Secondary outcomes Cumulative consumption of sufentanil by PCA during 0–4 hours, 4–8 hours, 8–24 hours and 24–48 hours. PCA pump first press time, which will be defined as the time from the beginning of the postoperative period to the first administration of analgesics. VAS score during movement and at rest at 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months postoperatively. (0 indicates no pain, 10 indicates the most severe pain imaginable.) Intraoperative opioid dosage: including sufentanil and remifentanil. Amount of postoperative oral analgesic remediation in the first 48 hours. Postoperative postoperative nausea and vomiting at 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively. (Ranging from 0 to 3; 0=no nausea; 1=mild nausea not requiring treatment; 2=nausea requiring treatment; 3=vomiting.) Ramsay Sedation Score at 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours postoperatively. Satisfaction score at 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months postoperatively. (Ramsey 1: Anxious, agitated, restless; Ramsey 2: Cooperative, oriented, tranquil; Ramsey 3: Responsive to commands only If Asleep; Ramsey 4: Brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus; Ramsey 5: Sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus; Ramsey 6: No response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus.) The WHO Quality of Life at 3 months postoperatively. (Higher scores indicate a better perception of quality of life.) Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 3 months postoperatively. (ODI consists of 10 sections, each addressing different aspects of daily life affected by back pain. Higher scores mean more severe pain.) Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) at 3 months postoperatively. (POSAS evaluates scar quality based on physical characteristics and the patient’s subjective experience. Lower scores indicate better scar quality and fewer issues. Higher scores reflect worse scar quality or greater subjective dissatisfaction. AEs at 3 months postoperatively will be categorised into acute and delayed events. Acute postoperative events include respiratory depression, pruritus, hypotension, bradycardia, emergence delirium, oversedation and any signs of local anaesthetic or steroid-associated systemic toxicity within 24 hours postoperatively. Delayed events, occurring within 3 months postoperatively, will include delayed incision healing, incision infections, intracranial infections and scar healing complications. Safety All AEs will be monitored and recorded in detail on case report forms (CRFs). Whenever an AE occurs, a thorough assessment will be conducted to evaluate its relationship to the study interventions. All AEs will be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and addressed by the research team without delay. Patients will be monitored until they return to a stable condition. If a serious AE occurs that leads to prolonged hospitalisation or death, it will be reported to the IRB immediately, and the trial will be terminated. Compensation for participants who sustain injuries as a result of the study will be provided in accordance with hospital policy. Data collection and monitoring The monitoring system will collect various data, including basic patient characteristics such as gender, age, weight, BMI and ASA status. Additionally, surgical details will be recorded, including the type of procedure (laminoplasty or laminectomy), the spinal region treated (cervical, thoracic or lumbar), and the number of levels involved. Perioperative haemodynamic parameters, including HR and mean arterial pressure, will be recorded at multiple time points: before anaesthetic induction, during skin incision, at skin closure and at the end of surgery. The dosage of intraoperative medications (sedatives, opioids and Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs), primary and secondary outcomes, incidence of complications and AEs will also be documented under the guidance of statistical experts. All required original data will be accurately and completely recorded using CRFs. The Data Monitoring Board (DMB), which operates independently of the study sponsor and any competing interests, will oversee the trial throughout its duration. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), also independent of the sponsor and competing interests, will be responsible for unblinding the study, evaluating efficacy and safety, and determining whether the trial should continue, undergo protocol modifications or be terminated. The DMC will notify the IRBs of any decisions. On study completion, allocation information, raw data and results will be submitted to the Scientific Research Management Committee, which will have full access to the final dataset. The results will remain confidential until they are formally published. Sample size calculation In our preliminary trial involving 75 patients equally distributed across five groups (0.012%, 0.009%, 0.006% and 0.003% diprospan concentrations, plus control), we observed an inverse relationship between diprospan concentration and postoperative sufentanil requirements at 48 hours. The mean values were: 11.5 µg (0.012% group), 17.2 µg (0.009% group), 18.6 µg (0.006% group), 20.8 µg (0.003% group) and 23.8 µg (control). Based on these pilot data, we established a minimum detectable difference of 12.3 with a SD of 15. Sample size calculations were performed using the Tukey-Kramer method for multiple comparisons in PASS software (V.15.0, NCSS), assuming a two-sided α of 0.05 and 80% power. This analysis indicated a required sample size of 480 participants (96 per group). To accommodate an anticipated 10% attrition rate, we increased enrolment to 535 participants (107 per group), maintaining equal 1:1:1:1:1 allocation. Statistical analysis The study will use modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses for evaluating primary and secondary study outcomes. For the primary analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was employed to compare group differences, adjusting for prespecified baseline covariates (eg, age, sex and baseline outcome measurements) where applicable. Model assumptions (linearity, homogeneity of variances and normality of residuals) were verified. If assumptions were violated, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used as a non-parametric alternative. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted using independent-samples t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, with p values adjusted via the Bonferroni correction (significance threshold: p<0.0125) to account for multiple comparisons. Secondary analyses for other outcomes used ANCOVA (or Kruskal-Wallis for non-normal data) for continuous variables and χ² tests for categorical variables. All statistical tests were two-sided, with p<0.05 considered significant unless otherwise specified. Analyses were performed using R V.4.1.2.
