Introduction Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica S 1 2 The incidence of travel-associated typhoid in high-income countries is rising annually, with ~300 cases of enteric fever reported in the UK. The majority (99%) of the cases are associated with recent travel to endemic countries [ 3 Salmonella Salmonella 3 Typhoidal infections are typically sub-acute with non-specific symptoms, leading to invasive infections associated with bacteraemia. Symptoms can develop over 6 weeks prior to bacteraemia and can relapse 4 weeks post-treatment [ 4 5 1 Most infections are cleared, with faecal shedding occurring in convalescent carriers from 3 weeks to 3 months post-infection and in temporary carriers from between 3 and 12 months [ 6 9 10 11 S 8 12 13 14 Salmonella 11 This case represents one of the earliest documented instances of household transmission facilitated by an asymptomatic carrier harbouring genetically diverse strains. Consequently, a healthy adult developed severe typhoid, necessitating hospitalization and two children required treatment. Public health epidemiological connections among cases are presented to support the findings of the phylogenetic analysis. However, while these links suggest a single source for the strains, the phylogenetic analysis reveals significant differences among them. This dichotomy underscores the complexity involved in employing discrete single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) thresholds to ascertain related cases of S Methodology Epidemiology and cases The clinical team reviewed a cluster involving four individuals from an extended family, where one individual required hospitalization, two others exhibited symptoms and one was initially asymptomatic, and they were considering it a potential household outbreak. Patient travel and clinical symptoms were obtained from hospital case notes and the UK Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA, formerly known as Public Health England) using an enhanced surveillance questionnaire. The local health protection units routinely follow up on all enteric fever contacts, including screening those within the household.

She also reported a sore throat and dry cough. The patient had no past medical history. Upon examination, she was febrile and had a clinical assessment early warning score of 5 [ 40 40 Initial laboratory investigations showed raised C-reactive protein with transaminitis. Her Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) swab was negative. She was hospitalized and started on intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam. Blood cultures were flagged as positive, at 24 h, for a Gram-negative bacillus. Direct identification using the Bruker MBT Sepsityper® test was performed, though no identification was given, and so broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of piperacillin-tazobactam was continued. The following day, the sub-cultured organism was identified as Salmonella . S Treatment was changed to treat S Case B Eight days after case A first presented, a symptomatic household contact, a 15-year-old sibling, reporting a 1-week history of generally feeling unwell and fever, submitted a stool sample for investigation. A blood culture was requested but not provided by the patient. S Case C Eighteen days after case A, an 11-year-old asymptomatic household contact, another sibling, also submitted a stool sample for investigations via their GP. Due to the patient being apyrexial, blood cultures were not indicated. S Case D Twenty days after case A presented, S S Clostridioides difficile 41 The patient remained asymptomatic during eradication therapy and upon completion of antibiotic therapy, a repeat stool sample was requested for clearance from which S S Table 1 Five months after the initial diagnosis, case D presented at the GP with diarrhoea. A stool sample was obtained from which multiple colony picks of S Table 1 Public health investigations and questionnaires confirmed person-to-person spread between all four cases in the community, with case D being the source. Antibiograms MIC of isolates from patients A, B and C and the first isolate from patient D (D1-1) initially all had the same MIC pattern, with the exception of trimethoprim for the isolate from patient B (B1, MIC <1 mg l −1 −1 −1 MurA 42 Genotyping and genetic diversity Isolates from the three cases, A, B and C, and the carrier, case D, were identified by genomic sequencing as S Table 1 Fig. 1 6 43 Table 1 S Fig. 1 Fig. 1. Maximum likelihood tree of S et al 21 S Despite being part of a monophyletic cluster in the context of global and circulating populations, there was genetic diversity among the isolates from the case cluster. Specifically, based on the determination of isolate SNP addresses (see methods, Table 1 6 44 45 Table 1 To explore the genetic diversity among case cluster isolates in greater detail, another phylogenetic tree was generated to specifically examine the relationships among the 16-case cluster isolates; 1 from each of cases A, B and C and the 13 from case D ( Table 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 2.

Of these, five were located in genes associated with specific functions: histidine metabolism ( hutG sinR, LysR SinR rpoS yhjK To explore the possible impact of the observed variation on bacterial function, we determined what the likely coding consequences of 95 SNPs found among the cluster isolates were. This revealed that 17 SNPs were in non-coding regions, 30 SNPs created synonymous changes, 48 SNPs created non-synonymous changes and six were loss-of-function mutations (Table S4). Of those SNPs overlapping coding regions, these occurred in: hypothetical proteins ( n n pdxA leuA argR metE malZ guaA glpR plsB fabG yiaQ cyoE ubiX n kefC potI yjeP yjeM n yehU narZ gtrB n pdxA leuA argR l metE guaA 46 48 glpR plsB fabG 49 51 yiaQ malZ ubiX 52 54 AMR and plasmid typing In silico Fig. 2a Fig. 2b aph(6)-Id bla catA-1 dfrA-7 sul-1 sul-2 S 55 gyrA parC Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Fig. 2b gyrA gyrA parC parC Fig. 2c Discussion This study detected a household outbreak of a genetically diverse population of S S S Table 1 S In our experience, carriers often present with delayed symptoms. S Although there is a difficulty in reliably reconstructing the evolutionary relationships of isolates within the H58 lineage due to high clonality and few SNPs from which to build a phylogeny [ 55 14 Specifically, these data highlight the complexity in interpreting SNP differences in typhoidal cases with contact tracing. Whereas typically the difficulty is the low mutation rate and distinguishing outbreak cases within an endemic population [ 6 44 S 6 The vast amount of variation observed within a single chronic carrier, as demonstrated in our study, indeed contrasts with the relatively small amount of variation observed over large populations and long periods in endemic settings [ 43 S 14 pdxA leuA argR l metE guaA 46 48,56 glpR plsB fabG 49 51 yiaQ malZ cyoE ubiX 52 54 Among the genes with known or probable functions, a significant portion was associated with metabolism.

This insight could have implications for developing strategies to prevent or manage chronic carriage cases, thereby reducing the risk of transmission to others. Additionally, investigating the specific genetic changes within these metabolic pathways may provide clues to the evolutionary dynamics driving the persistence and transmission of S Three identified genes may be involved in virulence or host adaptation: gtrB yehU narZ 58 60 gtrB 9 narZ Salmonella 58 58 Differences identified with AMR profiles between isolates are most likely due to the presence/absence of an IncQ1 plasmid. Both isolates found to not encode the IncQ1 rep type B1 (SRR12806902) and D3-3 (SRR13772107) also did not encode a number of AMR determinants compared to IncQ1 carrying isolates ( Table 1 Another interesting observation was that strains isolated from Patient D (D3-1) after treatment with fosfomycin exhibited resistance to this antibiotic but did not harbour the genotypic AMR marker, such as the presence of fosfomycin-modifying enzymes, including the metalloenzymes FosA, FosB and FosX ( Table 1 Fig. 2b murA 61 in vitro 62 S S 11 63 The observation that patient D harboured a genetically diverse population of S S S Although further investigation is warranted to establish specific links between individual SNPs or genes and carriage, these findings hint at ongoing host adaptation processes within carriage strains. This underscores the need for continued research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Salmonella Current guidelines Current guidelines [ 64 S 65 68 64 69 70 S Recommendation for the future The proportion of cases of enteric fever presenting without a travel history to endemic areas in the previous 28 days has been increasing over the past 3 years [ 6 Genomics may have a contribution in establishing genes that may play a part in establishing chronicity. Identifying genetic signatures associated with chronic carriage may enable the active identification of carrier-linked cases. However, without consistent routine monitoring of a risk within endemic populations, including asymptomatic patients, it would be difficult to know whether the carriage occurred in the UK or in an endemic setting over a period of years. Our microbiological processes of only testing one colony from a patient at the point of care limit our understanding of in-host variation of microbial population structures over time or exposures to genetically diverse populations at the source of original infection. We recommend further research to develop a cost-effective evidence-based protocol for testing of multiple colonies in selective cases, such as those with long-term carriage, to ensure optimal clearance regimens.
