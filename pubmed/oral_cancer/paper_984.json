This invasiveness contributes to resistance against conventional therapies and a high recurrence rate. Strategies capable of eliminating residual tumor cells are urgently needed. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), an FDA- and EMA-approved compound, induces selective accumulation of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in metabolically active tumor cells, enabling targeted cytotoxicity through light activation. A major limitation to its clinical application is the unclear variation in the cytotoxic effect of PDT according to individual tumoral differences. In this study, we propose and validate an in vivo model of patient-derived GB initiating cells (GICs) and brain organoids to test the effects of PDT. First, patient-derived GICs were molecularly characterized by flow cytometry and copy number variation profiling using OncoScan CNV Assays, then co-cultured with human brain organoids to generate a hybrid model recapitulating key aspects of the tumor microenvironment. 5-ALA photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy was assessed in vitro by GFP-based viability measurements, LDH release assays, and TUNEL staining. Then, a murine model was generated to study PDT in vivo, based on a heterotopic (renal subcapsular engraftment) xenograft of the GICs-human brain organoid co-culture. PDT was tested in the model; in each subject, one kidney tumoral engraftment was treated and the contralateral served as a control. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to study the cell composition of the brain organoid-tumoral engraftment after PDT, and the effects on non-GIC cells. The antitumoral effect was determined by the degree of cell death analysis with the TUNEL technique. The GICs-brain organoid co-culture resulted in tumoral growth and infiltration both in vitro and in vivo. The pattern of growth and infiltration varied according to the tumoral genetic profile. 5-ALA PDT resulted in a reduction in the number of GICs and an increase in apoptotic cells in all four lines tested in vitro. A correlation was found between the induced phototoxicity in vivo with the molecular typification of GICs cell lines in vitro. There were no changes in the number or distribution of neuronal cells after the application of PDT, while a reduction in active astrocytes was observed. 5-ALA PDT could be effective in eradicating GICs with a heterogeneous molecular profile. The hybrid human-murine model presented here could be useful in investigating adjuvant therapies in GB, under the concept of personalized medicine. glioblastoma photodynamic therapy 5-ALA organoid model Laboratorios Gebro Pharma S.A.

Introduction Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary brain malignancy in adults, accounting for almost 80% of such tumors [ 1 2 3 4 5 Unfortunately, recurrence is the norm, occurring on average seven months after treatment, invariably adopting a more aggressive form, and accounting for a one-year survival rate of approximately 60%. Notably, more than 80% of recurrences are located adjacent to the resection cavity. The fact that recurrences occur within the already treated area of resection denotes the ability of this tumor to resist conventional therapies. During the surgical resection, a certain degree of microscopic disease is left inadvertently; this is thought to correspond to the tumor front infiltrating white matter tracts and small vessels [ 6 7 8 9 10 To serve this idea, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been proposed. Indeed, after 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) administration, GB cells accumulate protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a molecule that acts both as a fluorophore and a photosensitizer (PS). PpIX fluorescence can be visualized using a modified neurosurgical microscope and is already used for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) [ 11 12 5-ALA already represents a standard approach for intraoperative fluorescence-guided oncologic neurosurgery. Exploiting 5-ALA as both a fluorophore and a PS to visually identify the neoplastic tissue and, simultaneously, to selectively destroy it, could improve the success of GB treatment [ 13 14 Although promising, data on the photo-toxic effects according to the diversity of genetic subtypes in GB is scarce [ 15 Our group has recently reported that glioblastoma initiating cells (GICs) co-cultured with brain organoids recapitulate many aspects of the disease and can be used in vitro to assess both the efficacy of local therapies and collateral damage to the surrounding brain cells [ 16 2. Results 2.1. Patient-Derived HCB-GICs Malignant Phenotype Samples from patients operated on in the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (HCB) were used to obtain HCB-GICs ( Supplementary Table S1 2 Supplementary Materials Four different HCB-GICs ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Supplementary Figure S1 CD133 showed variable expression among HCB-GICs ( Figure 1 p p Figure 1 2.2. Patient-Derived HCB-GICs Genotype We first explored the similarity between HCB-GICs obtained by primary culture of GB biopsies and their original tumor, to assess any deviation that could occur during the process of in vitro obtaining and expanding HCB-GICs ( Supplementary Figure S2 The comparison between DNA from the tumor tissue and the DNA from the HCH-GICs showed that HCB-GIC4, HCB-GIC19 and HCB-GIC20 shared almost 100% similarity. Interestingly, HCB-GIC1, the only one that differed from its primary tumor, had the highest accumulation of genetic alterations, suggesting genomic instability prone to induce in vitro genetic changes, resulting in the highest copy number alterations (CNA). We looked for the three main canonical pathways described as being involved in glioma genesis and altered in high-grade gliomas: p53, Rb and PIK3KC A loss in p53 was seen in HCB-GIC1, and preserved in HCB-GIC4, HCB-GIC19 and HCB-GIC20 cells. CNA of HCB-GICs confirmed that only HCB-GIC1 had gains in both tumor suppressor genes, p53 and Rb, validating the clinicopathological diagnosis of the tumor samples. Since p53 pathway is more often modulated by several factors, including the upstream microtube-binding protein regulators as MDM1 and MDM2 [ 17 HCB-GIC1 and HCB-GIC4 showed lost Rb; therefore, we examined genes such as CDK4 and CDK6, CDKN2A/B and CCND2 from Rb pathways. We found gains on CDK6 in all HCB-GICs with CDKN2 losses, while CDK4 and CCND2 gains were only observed in HCB-GIC1. PIK3KC amplifications were found in HCB-GIC1, and PIK3KC was lost in HCB-GIC4. The PIK3KC pathway was further studied, including PIK3CA, PIK3R, PTEN, EGFR, PDGFR1 and NF1. HCB-GICs had exhibited PTEN losses, which were biallelic in HCB-GIC4 and HCB-GIC19. In addition, all HCB-GICs had EGFR amplifications, the highest 12 copies in HCB-GIC20. Moreover, PIK3CA and PIK3R were both amplified in HCB-GIC1. PDGFR1 was amplified in HCB-GIC1, lost in HCB-GIC4 and normal in both HCB-GIC19 and HCB-GIC20. NF1 was normal in all cases, except for HCB-GIC1, where the original tumor sample presented cnLOH loss, in mosaicism, whereas the GIC-derived showed only loss. A genotypic heterogeneity among the four HCB-GICs was evident in the microarray analysis ( Supplementary Figure S3 2.3. Organoid Cell Composition and HCB-GICs Differential Phenotype Determined Their Growth on Cerebral Organoid Co-Cultures The expression of TUJ1 (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), SOX2 (neural progenitor cells), and O4 (oligodendrocytes) in the brain organoids used in this study had been previously characterized and validated by immunofluorescence in our published work. That study demonstrated that these organoids reliably develop the main cell types found in neural tissue [ 16 The pluripotent stem cell line BJ-Sev-iPSC possesses the intrinsic ability to self-organize into brain-like structures following sequential media changes. At 43 days, the multicellular aggregates contained polarized neural progenitors mimicking the developing cortex, as confirmed by the expression of key neural markers ( Supplementary Figure S4 The pluripotent stem cell line BJ-Sev-iPSC owned the intrinsic ability to self-organize into brain-like structures after subsequent changes of media. At 43 days, the multicellular aggregate contained a group of polarized neural progenitors mimicking the developing cortex, with cells expressing neural, stem and glial cell markers. Immunofluorescence analysis on cryosection organoids confirmed the expression of Tubulin betta class 3 (TUBB3-TUJ1), a marker of neurons at an early stage of differentiation, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte-specific marker ( Supplementary Figure S4 HCB-GICs’ ability to infiltrate organoids was assessed after 30 days of co-culture to identify the depth of GFP-positive cells migration ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Supplementary Figure S5 Moreover, we evaluated other malignant-associated phenotypic markers ( Supplementary Figure S7A 18 2.4. Photodynamic Therapy Effects In Vitro: HCB-GICs Infiltrating Brain Organoids After 5-ALA PDT in vitro, a significant decrease in the GFP fluorescence between the irradiated and non-irradiated co-cultures of HCB-GIC1, HCB-GIC4 and HCB-GIC19 was observed after 24 h and 72 h, ranging between 0.4 and 0.6-fold decrease ( p −3 p −4 p −4 p −3 p −4 p −3 Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S6 A significant increase in cell death ratios was detected in the wells treated with 5ALA/PDT, as shown by LDH assay analysis ( Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S6 p −6 −4 p −6 −3 p −4 p −4 p −6 p −6 This pattern was confirmed by immunofluorescence, which revealed a visible reduction in fluorescent cells in HCB-GICs co-cultured organoids after PDT compared to non-treated controls ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Regarding tumor capacity to grow, infiltrate and resist apoptosis after PDT, we assessed the expression of vimentin, nestin and SOX2 by immunofluorescence. While the first two appeared unchanged after therapy, SOX2 expression showed an apparent decrease after irradiation ( Supplementary Figure S7 2.5. Photodynamic Therapy Effects In Vivo: HCB-GICs-Brain-Organoid Xenografts HCB-GIC20 and HCB-GIC1 infiltrating brain organoids (15 days of in vitro co-culture) were xenografted in the renal subcapsular space of both NSG mice kidneys (N = 3 in each group). Tumor and organoid neural tissue expansion were evaluated 40 days after engraftment. PDT effectively decreased the HCB-GIC20 tumoral burden, measured as relative fluorescent units (RFU) on treated kidneys compared to contralateral untreated controls ( p Figure 5 p Supplementary Figure S10 Cell death was analyzed with the TUNEL technique ( Figure 6 p Figure 6 To determine potential effects of PDT on the surrounding brain cells, the expression of neural (TUJ1) and astrocytes (GFAP) was analyzed in the engrafted kidneys by IF ( Figure 6 p 3. Discussion In this translational study, we evaluate the effects of 5-ALA-mediated PDT in an unprecedented experimental design of human glioblastoma, based on a co-culture of patient-derived HCB-GICs and human brain organoids, both in vitro and in an in vivo murine model. HCB-GICs were obtained from a series of patients operated on in our institution, demonstrating the potential of the model to study treatment effects under the concept of personalized medicine. According to our data, PDT seems effective both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the variations seen in the tumor cytotoxic effect according to the intrinsic genetic profile of each HCB-GIC subtype can be reproduced under in vivo conditions. The present design could be used to optimize preclinical studies of PDT and to explore adjuvant strategies to enhance 5-ALA phototherapeutic and photodiagnostic effects in gliomas. 3.1. A New Concept in GB Preclinical Investigation Models Over the years, evidence generated by our laboratory and others has shown that patient-derived GICs are the most biologically and phenotypically relevant cells to study GB tumor initiation, maintenance and invasion [ 19 20 21 The introduction of organoids and tumorspheres as 3D models has enabled us to recapitulate more accurately the heterogeneity of the brain tissue and tumor properties [ 22 To overcome some of these limitations, we used a three-stage strategy to develop a valid model for evaluating the effects of PDT in GB. First, we obtained and characterized HCB-GICs from patients who had been operated on for GB. Second, we used these human HCB-GICs cell lines to infiltrate human brain organoids, containing neural, stem and glial cells. This 3D culture of HCB-GICs and brain organoids served as a platform to profile the malignant behavior of the different HCB-GIC subtypes, and to test their response to PDT with 5-ALA. Third, we transferred the HCB-GICs-organoid co-culture to the renal subcapsular space of NSG mice to test PDT in vivo. We optimized the primary culture protocol, ensuring the maintenance of the initial HCB-GICs phenotype. The striking ability of HCB-GFP-GICs to proliferate and infiltrate the cerebral organoid simulated the infiltrative phenotype of GB. This cellular framework provided a potential mechanism for cell–to–cell signaling and intrinsic secretion of growth factors, guiding neuronal and glial development, altogether supplying a perfect microenvironment for HCB-GICs to invade and infiltrate organoids. Only one of the cell lines showed significant genetic deviations from the original tumor, the HCB-GIC1. This underscores that the heterogeneity of GB might induce a sampling to in vitro disaggregation with different subpopulations, even with some advantageous cells able to develop subclones expanding the main genetic alteration and giving value to the model for research purposes. 3.2. Profiling Patient-Specific HCB-GIC Cell Lines During the first stage of characterization of HCB-GICs derived from patients with GB, we found several differences in the genetic and molecular profiles. According to the consensus clustering that identifies four subtypes of GB, a high level of EGFR amplification is observed in 97% of the classical subtype and infrequently in other subtypes of GB [ 23 CD133 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein seen on the surface of stem cells, used as a biomarker for GICs. CD133 is associated with the mesenchymal phenotype of GB cells, with poor prognosis, therapy resistance, and tumor recurrence [ 24 24 All HCB-GICs overexpressed CD44, which has been associated with the activation of genes mediating cell invasion under severe hypoxia conditions, and with genes mediating cell proliferation under moderate hypoxia. Both genetically activated pathways are key components of GB recurrence [ 25 3.3. Evaluating 5-ALA PDT Effect on HCB-GICs-Organoid In Vitro Model Our group had previously explored the effects of 5-ALA-mediated PDT in vitro in a platform of GICs infiltrating cerebral organoids. In this initial experience, we demonstrated that two different GB cells, GIC7 and PG88, had different capacities to invade the brain organoid, and showed a different response to PDT [ 16 At this stage, we used this model to test the effects of PDT in a series of HCB-GICs derived from patients operated on for GB. Here, we demonstrate that patient-derived HCB-GICs can invade the brain organoids and, importantly, remain susceptible to PDT. After the HCB-GICs-organoids were exposed to a medium containing 5-ALA and subsequently brought to a light source of 485 nm and 1.2 J/cm 2 Our findings support the idea that 5-ALA-mediated PDT can be an effective therapy for treating GB cells within the tumor niche. The model thus created could also be explored to study the potential adverse effects of PDT on the normal surrounding brain cells within the organoid. However, a limitation in this scenario is the lack of vascularization of the brain organoid. Indeed, the ability of GB to invade and induce the formation of neo vessels is a primary characteristic of this tumor [ 8 3.4. Evaluating 5-ALA PDT Effect on HCB-GICs-Organoid In Vivo Model To better understand the limitations of the GICs-organoid in vitro model, we transferred the HCB-GICs co-cultured with human brain organoid to an experimental in vivo murine model. The spherical co-cultures of human GICs-organoids were implanted in the renal subcapsular space of immunosuppressed NSG mice [ 26 Compared to other murine models of GB, the unique content of both tumor cells and normal brain cells, both belonging to humans, makes this a unique platform. As both GB and neural/glial cells coexist within the same culture, it allows observing the interactions between transformed and non-transformed cells, making it useful to study essential tumor biology and giving valuable information for preclinical investigation of new compounds. For drug screening, this design enables an analysis of anti-tumor effects accompanied by collateral effects on healthy neural tissue, all in the same platform. Optimizing PDT effects can be undertaken by increasing 5-ALA uptake, PpIX accumulation or exploring different light irradiation regimens that affect tissue oxygenation and may influence free radical production and oxidative stress. The importance of fractionation has already been emphasized by Curnow et al. and Vermandel et al. [ 27 28 3.5. Strengths and Limitations of the GICs-Organoid Xenograft Model In vivo models represent a step forward in modeling tumor complexity, as cells are implanted in a living organism where many types of dynamic interactions may occur, which condition therapy effectiveness. These may overcome some of the limitations seen in in vitro organoid models, in which the microenvironment interactions are restricted to cells that are already present in the tumor or that are artificially reconstructed and maintained by adding high amounts (even non-physiological) of cytokines, growth factors, serum, nutrients, etc. An important feature in the HCB-GICs-organoid xenograft in mice is that tumoral and glioneural cells derive from humans and can be personalized with patient-derived tumoral and peripheral pluripotent cells. This advantage may be exploited to test the effects of specific therapies before administering them to the patient. Another remarkable asset of working with hybrid in vivo models based on organoid engraftment is the presence of vascularization and systemic immune responses, which may provide additional information regarding treatment response and mechanisms of resistance. The limitations of this model are inherent to its xenograft nature and to its heterotopic location. The engraftment of human cells in mice requires the use of immunosuppressed strains, which do not allow studying the systemic immune responses to tumor development and to treatment. Conversely, it allows the use of patient-specific cells, which could have potential benefits in testing therapeutic responses in the era of personalized medicine. Furthermore, the idea of placing the tumor-organoid engraftment in the kidney allowed simplifying and homogenizing the experimental procedure and transforming the avascular tumor-organoid platform into a vascular one. However, this construction does not allow accounting for specific intracranial phenomena, such as the effects of the blood-brain barrier in the treatment response. 3.6. Immunological Implications of 5-ALA PDT Therapy Recent studies have demonstrated that tumor-associated myeloid cells, particularly hyperactivated macrophages, exhibit elevated expression of heme oxygenase-1 and play a key role in ALA metabolism. These cells can accumulate and convert ALA into PpIX, suggesting a strong immunological and cellular component to PDT sensitivity and toxicity [ 29 30 Although we did not specifically study myeloid cells in this study, we did find changes suggestive of immunological effects secondary to 5-ALA-mediated PDT. GFAP+ cells (astrocytes) were seen in the areas of infiltrative tumor. This astroglial proliferation/migration might be attributed to differences in the tumor microenvironment that promote astrocyte interactions with glioma cells and seem essential for glioma development and a crucial target in preventing glioma recurrences [ 16 31 32 33 34 In that sense, in our model, PDT decreased GFAP+ cells as well as HCB-GICs but did not seem to affect other glial and neural cells present in the organoid. These observations may indicate the relative specificity of the PDT treatment for both tumor and reactive astrocytes, while preserving the normal brain. The modulation of the immunological response in the tumor microenvironment may explain the fact that PDT anti-tumoral effects seemed to be potentiated in vivo. In fact, the degree of tumor fluorescence in HCB-GIC20 cells was significantly higher in the in vivo xenograft than in the in vitro application of PDT. Following these preliminary observations, the presence of myeloid or other stromal components in the tumor microenvironment warrants further investigation in our model. All in all, a major strength of this model, including human-derived glioneural organoids, is its potential ability to test collateral effects of damage to the surrounding brain when applying direct therapies such as 5ALA-mediated PDT in gliomas. Based on our preliminary findings, after the application of PDT, the number of TUT+ cells (corresponding to neurons) remained unchanged, while the GFAP+ cells (considered as reactive astrocytes) diminished in the area surrounding the tumor. These observations support the idea of PDT as tumor-specific and, up to some extent, immunomodulatory, yet this idea warrants future detailed exploration. 3.7. Limitations of the Study Several limitations can be found in this study. First, the fact that the GIC cell lines derived from patient-specific samples limits the extrapolation of the therapeutic effects to the general population. Second, the therapeutic scheme for PDT in terms of irradiation time and dosage has not been standardized, and different results may be obtained with other regimes. Third, the effects attributed to the intracranial space, such as the presence of the blood–brain barrier or raised intracranial pressure, cannot be accounted for in this model. Fourth, the specific design in this study, where animal sacrifice was performed at the final stage after therapy, did not allow for a formal comparison of tumor volumes between the treatment and control kidney engraftments. However, given that the same number of GIC-organoids were implanted in each kidney and that they were exposed to the same conditions, a parallel tumor growth shall be assumed. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Obtention of Glioblastoma Cell Lines and Organoids Glioblastoma-initiating cells (GICs) were obtained from surgical biopsies at the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, as previously described by Frenster et al. (2018) [ 35 Supplementary Materials Cells transduction and Organoid generation. For longitudinal tracking, HCB-GICs were transduced with GFP-expressing lentiviral vectors [ 36 Co-culture assembly. Co-cultures were established by seeding GFP-labeled HCB-GICs onto mature organoids, as previously described by Pedrosa et al. (2023) [ 16 4.2. Molecular Profiling of HCB-GICs DNA extraction and analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from primary cultures by using the Blood and Cell Culture DNA Mini kit (Qiagen 13323, Hilden, Germany) and from tumor tissues by using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 56404, Hilden, Germany). Total DNA was quantified with the Invitrogen Qubit 4 fluorometer. Concentration and purity of DNA were determined by measuring the absorbance (A260/280) of the sample with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Genetic assessment. The OncoScan assays (Applied Biosystems™, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for genetic comparison between HCB-GICs and their respective tumours. Analysis was performed with Chromosome Analysis Suite Version 4.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.3. Cellular Components of Human Brain Organoids and GICs Co-Cultures The cellular composition and spatial distribution within the brain organoids were assessed by double immunofluorescence and by flow cytometry analysis of CD44 and CD133 expression in GFP + Supplementary Materials 4.4. 5-ALA/PDT Testing In Vitro: HCB-GICs & Brain-Organoid Co-Cultures The in vitro 5-ALA PDT experiments were conducted using twin 96-well plates: one plate for irradiation (1.2 J/cm 2 16 2 4.5. Determination of PDT Efficacy In Vitro In vitro efficacy of 5-ALA PDT was evaluated using three complementary assays. Fluorescence of HCB-GICs expressing GFP was measured (excitation 485 nm, emission 530 nm) from the bottom of each well (lid in place) at 12 randomized positions per well using an Infinite M Plex plate reader (Tecan, Trading AG, Switzerland). Readings were acquired immediately post-irradiation (t = 0) and at 24 h (t = 1) and 72 h (t = 2), and viability loss was quantified as the ratio of GFP signal at t = 1 or t = 2 relative to t = 0, with representative high-resolution images captured under GFP filter on an EVOS M7000 (Invitrogen, Thermo Scientific). Concurrently, 25 µL of supernatant was collected at each time point to measure lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH Cytotoxicity Assay) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The amount of LDH released into the medium was used as an indicator of cell death. Differential LDH levels between time points were calculated to assess changes in cytotoxicity. Apoptotic cell death was determined by TUNEL staining. Co-cultures were fixed and stained using the Click-iT Plus TUNEL kit (Invitrogen, C10618 4.6. Animal Subjects All experiments involving animals were approved by the Ethics Committee of our University (PNT 2090206 DOC/002). All methods were carried out in accordance with the institutional animal care guidelines and relevant regulations under the protocol CEEA 421/22, which were controlled periodically during the experimental process. NOD/SCID/gamma(c)(null) mice (NSG), which are double homozygous for the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mutation and interleukin-2Rgamma (IL-2Rgamma) allelic mutation (gamma(c)(null)), were used for the in vivo experiments. 4.7. 5-ALA/PDT Testing In Vivo: HCB-GICs Human-Brain-Organoid Xenograft Details on the generation of the HCB-GICs brain-organoid xenograft in the renal subcapsular space of immunosuppressed mice can be found in Supplementary Materials Supplementary Materials Selected animals were administered 5-ALA (Gliolan, 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride) orally at 100 mg/kg and protected from lighting. After 4 h, 5ALA/PDT was delivered to one of the kidneys (right side), at a wavelength of 635 nm and a power of 5 mW for 10 min. In each mouse, the contralateral kidney (left side) was left untreated as a control. The procedure was carried out under general anesthesia with isoflurane 4% induction and 2% maintenance, while oxygenation was kept at a FiO2 of 30% during the whole duration of the experiment. A custom-made integrated irradiation system was used for PDT (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, UPC, Barcelona, Spain). The instrument was specifically designed to guarantee that the light emitted was directed only to the area of interest. This was achieved by an adjustable diaphragm coupled with the light-emitting diode. Before starting the irradiation period, the selected kidney was externalized by reopening the retroperitoneal incision used during the first intervention for tumor engraftment. The opening of the diaphragm was manually adjusted to cover the surface of the kidney, making sure the lightened area was restricted to the kidney. The contralateral kidney used as a control (and other surrounding tissues) was protected from the light source throughout the whole duration of the PDT delivery. For this, the control kidney was kept in the retroperitoneal space, and the area of light exposure was restricted to the area occupied by the contralateral externalized kidney. After the treatment, animals were kept alive for seven days after sacrifice and kidney removal. IVIS Imaging System (Caliper, Hopkinton, MA, USA) was used for ex vivo measurement of the relative fluorescent units (RFU) of GFP-positive cells as indicative of tumor burden. Emission of RFU on treated kidneys in comparison with the contralateral untreated controls was evaluated. Renal tissues were then fixed and preserved. 4.8. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t test or ANOVA were used as appropriate using GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.2, Insightful science, CA, USA). A Bonferroni post-hoc test was performed to compare the replicate means. Statistical significance was denoted as: * p p p Additional information on the methodology can be found in Appendix A Appendix B Appendix C Appendix D 5. Conclusions We describe an in vitro and in vivo model of human glioblastoma based on a co-culture allowing the infiltration of glioblastoma-initiating cells into brain organoids, which can be studied ex vivo or transferred to immunosuppressed mice as a xenograft. Both strategies were constructed upon patient-derived tumoral cells and demonstrated to capture the genetic heterogeneity of glioblastoma, providing a realistic and personalized model for therapy testing. We successfully applied the model to test the effects of 5-ALA-mediated PDT both in vitro and in vivo and describe the differences in the treatment effects according to the genetic and phenotypic properties of each cell line. These results may be determinant to understand the role of the microenvironment in GB biology and treatment response.

Patient-Derived HCB-GICs: Clinical Features HCB-GICs were obtained from a series of four patients surgically treated at our institution. According to the Pathology Department and based on the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System criteria (5th edition, 2021), all four patients were diagnosed with MGMT-methylated IDH wild-type grade 4 gliomas. These patients were part of a bigger dataset including detailed clinical records of patients undergoing various treatments for brain tumors. The codified registry was conducted between January 2021 and December 202, and contains information about diagnostic timelines, progression patterns, and survival outcomes. Progression-free survival (PFS) intervals varied widely between the four subjects, from early progression (e.g., 95 days) to prolonged intervals (e.g., 795 days). Progression types are categorized into pseudo-progression and genuine progression, supporting nuanced survival analyses. Treatment regimens also varied, encompassing monotherapies, combined modalities such as radiotherapy with temozolomide, and the use of bevacizumab in recurrent cases, with some patients undergoing complete surgical resections. Outcome data include overall survival (OS) times, with durations of up to 901 days, and clearly documented death dates and follow-up records, ensuring accurate survival endpoints. Recurrence was noted in several cases, often linked to progression events, and follow-up dates span from 2021 to 2024, allowing for robust longitudinal analyses. Histological analysis revealed a predominant astroglial differentiation ( Supplementary Figure S1 From the resected tumors from these patients, we obtained four different HCB-GICs (following the described protocol, Figure 1 About 15–20 days after the isolation, we observed the formation of tumorspheres. In fact, HCB-GIC19 and HCB-GIC20 formed tumorspheres, in contrast to HCB-GIC4 that showed the ability to grow in adhesion with a characteristic spicular cytoplasmic neural-like extension ( Figure 1 Supplementary Figure S2 Since the sole formation of tumorspheres does not provide, per se, a demonstration of the presence of GSCs, the stem nature of the HCB-GICs primary cultures was further evident by evaluating the expression of specific markers of stemness and invasion as CD133 and CD44, respectively, using flow cytometry. CD133, a membrane-bound glycoprotein found on the surface of stem cells, showed variable expression among HCB-GICs ( Figure 1 p p Figure 1 Appendix B. Primary Cell Lines Establishment With written consent from patients and in accordance with the University of Barcelona guidelines, glioblastoma initiating cells (GICs) were obtained from successive glioblastoma biopsies as previously described [ 17 g Figure 1 Supplementary Materials Cerebral organoids. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were first cultured on Geltrex and then transferred to low-adherence U-bottom 96-well plates, where they were grown in spheroid starter media containing specific inhibitors and supplements [ 18 HCB-GIC-Organoid Co-culture. The protocol of co-culture was performed as previously described [ 16 3 Appendix C Appendix C.1. DNA Extraction and Analysis Genomic DNA was extracted from primary cultures by using the Blood and Cell Culture DNA Mini kit (Qiagen 13323, Hilden, Germany) and from tumor tissues by using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, 56404, Hilden, Germany). The manufacturer’s instructions were followed and after the protein removal, the samples were placed into a spin column system to concentrate DNA before elution. The total DNA from each sample was quantified using the Invitrogen Qubit 4 fluorometer from Thermo Fisher. The concentration and the purity of the extracted DNA were determined by measuring the absorbance (A260/280) of the sample with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Appendix C.2. Genetic Assessment The OncoScan assays (Applied Biosystems™, Thermo Fisher Scientific), based on Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) technology, are proven for identifying CN (copy numbers) alterations, and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) was used for genetic comparison between HCB-GICs and their respective tumors. This assay has been shown to perform well with highly degraded DNA, such as that derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples of various ages, and with low amounts of DNA starting material. The analysis was performed with Chromosome Analysis Suite Version 4.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All samples met quality control (QC) thresholds and were included in the analysis. Data was analyzed using annotations of genome version GRCh38 (hg38). Detailed visual data analysis was performed in all samples in addition to software-reported alterations. Only copy number (CN) segments with a minimum genomic size of 100 Kb and with at least 20 SNP/CN-altered markers cnLOH ≥ 5 Mb were reported. Furthermore, inborn genetic abnormalities were excluded by comparing findings with control Databases. SNP array data have been deposited in the GEO database under accession number GSE279049 Appendix C.3. Double Immunofluorescence (IF) Analysis Whole organoids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min, washed with PBS prior to overnight (O/N) incubation in 30% sucrose (weight/volume) at 4 °C and embedded in Tissue-Tek ® Supplementary Table S1 Images were captured at 10×, 20× and 40× magnifications, using Nikon Eclipse Ni (Izasa Scientific, Barcelona, Spain) fluorescence microscope and analyzed using ImageJ 1.54 g and GraphPad Prism. Average protein expression of IF images was assessed by quantifying positive cells in five different areas of both control and PDT tissues at 40×. Appendix C.4. TUNEL Analysis Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) assay (Click-iT Plus TUNEL, Invitrogen, C10618 Fluoromount DAPI was used as a nuclear counterstain. Images were taken with a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E (Izasa Scientific, Barcelona, Spain) fluorescence microscope using standard fluorescein excitation and emission filters. Images were analyzed using ImageJ 1.54g and GraphPad Prism. Appendix C.5. Flow Cytometry The expression profiles of CD44 and CD133 in GFP-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Three independent experiments were carried out for all cell lines. Briefly, 106 cells were washed with 1% BSA in PBS (FC buffer) and centrifuged at 2000 rpm 5 min. Cell pellets resuspended in 100 µL of FC buffer were incubated with the appropriate antibody, either PE-conjugated 1/100 anti-CD133 (Milteny Biotech, 130-111-079, Bergisch, Germany) or 1/25 anti-CD44 (BD Pharmingen, 550392,Spain) followed by secondary AF594 at 1/1000 (Invitrogen, A11005) 30 min on ice in the dark. The analysis was carried out in an LRSFortessa 5L flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Madrid, Spain). Unstained cells served as negative controls. Appendix D Appendix D.1. In Vivo Model of Renal Subcapsular HCB-GICs Brain-Organoid Engraftment Mice were housed in an animal room with strict humidity (50–60%) and temperature (22–24 °C) control, under a 12-h day/night cycle. Groups of three animals were housed in plastic cages with free access to standard food and tap water. Engraftment procedure. First, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane 4% and maintained with an inhalation dose of 2%. After disinfecting the surgical site, the retroperitoneum was accessed through a 1.5–2 cm midline dorsal incision. Through a blunt dissection of the paraspinal muscles, the left kidney was identified and carefully exteriorized, preserving its hilum. The renal capsule was incised for 2–4 mm with an ophthalmic knife and the subcapsular space was delicately dissected. Using a glass pipette with a blunt tip, four organoids/GICs were inoculated in the subcapsular space. The kidney was then reintroduced into the retroperitoneal space. The same procedure was then repeated in the right kidney. The wound was closed with surgical staples ( Supplementary Figure S11 Appendix D.2. In Vivo 5-ALA/PDT Treatment On day +40 after organoid/tumor engraftment in the renal subcapsular space of NSG mice, 5ALA/PDT was delivered to one of the kidneys (right side). In each mouse, the contralateral kidney (left side) was left untreated as a control. Before proceeding to PDT in vivo treatment, 5-ALA uptake, metabolism, and optimal time window for the use of oral 5-ALA as the PDT substrate was explored ( Supplementary Figure S8 Supplementary Figure S9 A custom-made integrated irradiation system was used for PDT (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, UPC, Barcelona, Spain). The instrument with an LED M625L4 (SN M00928350) was regulated by a power supply LEDD1B (SN M00949558), T-Cube LED Driver (Thorlabs Inc. GmbH). The spectrometer CAS140D157U1B (SN 303014423) from Instrument Systems, GmbH, has been calibrated with standards from the Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). First, animals were administered 5-ALA (Gliolan, 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride) orally through a nasogastric canula, at a dose of 100 mg/kg. After administration, they were protected from lighting and 4 h later, the PDT procedure began. Animals were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and maintained with a 2% inhalation dose. The midline dorsal incision was reopened, and the right kidney was externalized as described above. The irradiation probe was placed 3 cm above the surface of the kidney to attain the optimal lighting exposure as specified by the manufacturer. The light diaphragm available in the irradiation device was applied to include the whole kidney and minimize the exposure of adjacent structures. The right kidney was irradiated at a wavelength of 635 nm and a power of 5 mW for 10 min. After PDT, the kidney was reintroduced in the retroperitoneal cavity and the wound was again closed. The left (control) kidney was kept in the retroperitoneal space, protected from the light. Animals were maintained under close postoperative surveillance for three days. They were kept alive for seven days after sacrifice and kidney removal. IVIS Imaging System (Caliper, Hopkinton, MA) was used for ex vivo measurement of the relative fluorescent units (RFU) of GFP-positive cells as indicative of tumor burden. Emission of RFU on treated kidneys in comparison with the contralateral untreated controls was evaluated. Renal tissues were then preserved as described before: first fixed 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min, washed with PBS prior to overnight incubation in 30% sucrose (weight/volume) at 4 °C and embedded in OCT.

HCB-GICs expressing GFP (green) invaded brain organoids and were divided into two groups: pretreated with 5-ALA (50 µg/mL) prior to PDT and untreated (control).

Each mouse received two contralateral kidney implants: one control and one treated with PDT. At the endpoint, kidneys were harvested, and GFP fluorescence was measured ex vivo on an IVIS Imaging System (Caliper) to assess tumor burden. RFU values were corrected for local background and normalized to the number of implanted organoids.
