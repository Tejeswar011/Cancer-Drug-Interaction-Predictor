Introduction Erythropoiesis, the formation of red blood cells, is tightly regulated by erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone secreted mainly by renal interstitial fibroblast-like cells in adults and hepatocytes during fetal development. It governs the production of erythrocytes, with an estimated daily output of approximately 200 billion new red blood cells per individual [ 1 2 EPO synthesis is predominantly stimulated by hypoxic conditions and occurs primarily in the interstitial fibroblasts of the adult kidney, whereas during fetal and perinatal development, it is produced mainly by perisinusoidal cells in the liver [ 1 3 4 The pharmacological attributes of ESAs have been exploited illicitly in sports to enhance performance by increasing the oxygen transport capacity of the blood. Advances in analytical techniques have facilitated the detection of EPO and its metabolites. Additional confirmatory assays have been developed, and anti-doping protocols continue to evolve accordingly [ 5 Challenges in anti-doping efforts include the need for robust validation of detection techniques and the ongoing development of novel erythropoiesis-enhancing strategies, such as gene doping and the use of EPO analogs or mimetics [ 6 7 Clinical investigations on ESA dosing and the EPO resistance index are essential for understanding treatment efficiency and patients’ outcomes. They can guide adjustments to optimize safety and effectiveness of the treatment [ 8 1 2. Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents EPO, a glycoprotein hormone composed of amino acids, is primarily synthesized in renal interstitial fibroblast-like cells in adults and to a lesser extent in the liver during the fetal development. In conditions of reduced tissue oxygenation (under hypoxic conditions) the synthesis takes place in other organs such as the spleen and bone marrow [ 1 8 ® ® ® 9 The principal stages involved in the production of ESAs are outlined in Table 1 10 ESAs are employed in a variety of therapeutic settings to promote red blood cell production, sustain adequate hemoglobin levels, and prevent erythropoietic resistance [ 11 12 13 14 15 Figure 1 16 A schematic representation of the developmental pathway of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) illustrates their origin, migration, and differentiation potential. HSCs are primarily located in the bone marrow in adults and possess the ability to differentiate into various blood cell lineages. During embryogenesis, HSCs originate in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region—a critical site for definitive hematopoiesis. From there, they enter the circulatory system and migrate to extraembryonic tissues such as the yolk sac and placenta, where they continue their maturation. As development progresses, these cells acquire full hematopoietic potential and are capable of giving rise to all blood cell types. HSCs express specific surface markers, including GPI80 and PROM1 (also known as CD133), which help define their identity and function. Eventually, they colonize the bone marrow, which becomes the primary hematopoietic site. Throughout fetal development, HSCs are also present in the umbilical cord blood, as they traffic between the placenta and the fetal circulation, making cord blood a valuable source of stem cells at birth. There is ongoing safety concerns associated with the use of ESAs, particularly regarding the role of ESA therapy in patients with reduced EPO production. To evaluate the safety profile of ESAs in dialysis patients, dosing strategies and resistance indices have been examined. Moreover, several pathological conditions resulting from either insufficient or excessive EPO production have been characterized. These findings have supported the development of innovative therapeutic agents that improve the safety of ESA use, particularly in the management of hematological malignancies [ 8 With the expiration of patents for originator ESAs, biosimilar products have emerged as cost-effective alternatives. Biosimilars (EPO analogs) are designed to be highly similar to the original ESAs in terms of analytical structure, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic efficacy. In 2006, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) introduced a comprehensive guideline to support the development and approval of biosimilar medicines, which continues to be regularly updated. According to this regulatory framework, an approved biosimilar must demonstrate high similarity to the reference biological product in all critical aspects. The regulatory framework governing EPO analogs encompasses several critical aspects, including molecular structure, safety profile, immunogenicity, pharmacological, toxicological and pharmacokinetic evaluations, as well as biological assessments and post-marketing surveillance of the approved products [ 19 20 21 3. The Hematopoietic Role of Erythropoietin in the Era of Personalized Medicine EPO plays a crucial role in regulating erythropoiesis throughout fetal, neonatal, infant, and adult life—though not during the embryonic stage. As mentioned before, EPO production is upregulated by renal interstitial cells through a mechanism involving hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α). As a result, in adults approximately 90–95% of EPO is synthesized in the kidneys, with the liver contributing the remaining portion [ 22 23 Renal oxygen sensing relies on Hb concentration; when oxygen levels drop, such as during hypoxia, EPO production is accelerated. EPO binds to EPORs, thereby stimulating erythrocyte production and enhancing tissue oxygen delivery [ 24 25 26 Transcription factors, particularly HIFs, orchestrate the cellular response to low oxygen availability. Under hypoxic conditions, HIFs activate a transcriptional program that enables the organism to adapt both functionally and metabolically, including promoting vascular remodeling. HIF is a heterodimeric complex consisting of one of three oxygen-sensitive subunits—HIF-1α, HIF-2α, or HIF-3α—paired with the constitutively expressed HIF-1β. Among these, HIF-2α plays a pivotal role in regulating the erythropoietic response to hypoxia [ 27 Under normoxic conditions, HIF-α subunits undergo proline hydroxylation, a modification catalyzed by the iron-dependent enzyme prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), which targets them for proteasomal degradation. In contrast, hypoxic conditions inhibit this degradation, allowing HIF-α to stabilize and accumulate. Specifically, HIF-2α becomes upregulated in erythropoietin-producing renal cells, where it directly regulates the transcription of the erythropoietin gene. Mutations in HIF-2α are associated with elevated red blood cell production, reflecting its role in enhancing EPO synthesis. On hematopoietic cells responsive to EPO—particularly early-stage erythroid progenitor cells—EPORs are highly expressed. This receptor density facilitates fine-tuned EPO signaling, promoting the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of erythroid progenitors into mature red blood cells. EPO binds to EPORs on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, initiating a cascade that includes tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine, an amino acid, plays a crucial role in cellular function regulation and energy metabolism. Through this interaction, EPO modulates EPOR expression, with receptor levels being dynamically adjusted throughout the stages of erythroid differentiation [ 1 26 Personalized medicine represents a paradigm shift from “one-size-fits-all” approaches to strategies tailored to individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. Within this framework, erythropoietin (EPO) and its analogs have gained renewed interest not only in treating anemia but also in a variety of non-hematologic conditions, including neurodegeneration, metabolic dysfunctions, and ischemic injuries [ 28 The efficacy of EPO therapy depends heavily on individual patient factors such as EPOR gene polymorphisms, inflammatory state, iron metabolism, and comorbidities. EPO exerts its biological effects via binding to EPORs, activating JAK2/STAT5, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK signaling pathway [ 29 30 EPO resistance is a significant challenge in patients with chronic kidney disease or inflammatory diseases. Pharmacogenomic profiling can identify genetic variants associated with hypo-responsiveness to EPO [ 31 32 33 Recent advances have demonstrated EPO’s neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and metabolic regulatory effects. In the central nervous system, EPO modulates neuroinflammation, prevents apoptosis, and enhances neurogenesis [ 34 35 36 The advent of EPO analogs (e.g., epoetin zeta, darbepoetin alfa) offers cost-effective alternatives to originator EPOs. Comparative immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and clinical outcomes need to be carefully considered [ 37 New therapeutic avenues include HIF-PHIs and gene therapy approaches that modulate endogenous EPO production. Roxadustat, daprodustat, and vadadustat represent promising oral agents that restore EPO levels in a physiologically regulated manner [ 38 39 Personalized EPO therapy must balance efficacy with safety. Monitoring for thrombotic events, cardiovascular risk, and long-term effects on tumor progression is essential [ 40 41 4. Erythropoietin Beyond Hematopoiesis: Exploring Its Non-Hematopoietic Functions 4.1. Non-Hematopoietic Roles of EPO EPO is a pleiotropic cytokine whose biological activity extends beyond the regulation of erythropoiesis. It binds to and activates EPORs not only on hematopoietic cells but also on various non-hematopoietic tissues. Current literature indicates that EPO is involved in numerous physiological processes, including angiogenesis, cardioprotection, neuroprotection, stress response modulation, anti-inflammatory actions, energy metabolism regulation, maintenance of homeostasis, and control of oxidative metabolism [ 42 43 44 EPO is also expressed in endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and muscle cells, where it plays a protective role by preventing apoptosis and reducing collagen deposition in ischemic myocardial tissue [ 45 46 47 48 RHuEPO is also recognized for its neuroprotective and neurorestorative properties, particularly in the context of the premature brain. It has been shown to reduce white matter injury and decrease the need for red blood cell transfusions in preterm infants. Nevertheless, only a limited number of controlled studies have assessed its long-term impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 49 50 However, excessive administration of EPO may result in elevated hematocrit levels, potentially leading to adverse effects such as hypertension and increased blood viscosity. The neuroprotective actions of EPO and its derivatives are illustrated in Figure 2 51 EPO plays a significant role in muscle development and remodeling, contributing to an increased number of skeletal muscle fibers and enhancing physical performance capacity [ 54 55 56 57 EPO plays a critical role in regulating energy metabolism and the expression of EPORs in white adipose tissue (WAT). Studies have shown that male mice lacking EPORs specifically in adipose tissue exhibit increased fat mass and a heightened susceptibility to diet-induced obesity [ 58 59 In the context of diet-related obesity, EPO administration exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and reducing macrophage activity [ 60 61 Ruan et al. demonstrated in their study [ 62 63 This suggests that itaconate and EPO may act synergistically during stress-induced erythropoiesis [ 61 64 65 4.2. Clinical and Preclinical Validation of EPOs Non-Hematopoietic Effects The non-hematopoietic effects of EPO can be validated preclinically, as well as clinically. Distinguishing between clinical and preclinical validation for non-hematopoietic EPO effects is crucial for ensuring therapeutic efficacy and patient safety. Preclinical studies involve cell cultures and animal models, being able to establish the foundational evidence for EPO’s broad therapeutic potential beyond red blood cell production. Clinical trials are conducted on humans and can confirm whether these effects translate to safe and efficient treatment in diverse patient populations (for specific conditions). This distinction is relevant because findings in animal models do not always predict human outcomes and are able to predict significant risks, such as adverse cardiovascular events. The neuroprotective effects of EPO are preclinically validated in rats subjected to cardiac ischemia injury. The results of the study [ 66 67 67 46 68 4.3. Bridging EPO Functions and Gene Expression While EPO is well known for its role in red blood cell production, recent research has highlighted its diverse effects on non-hematopoietic tissues, including: cardioprotection, metabolic regulation, neuroprotection and tissue repair [ 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 50 5. Modulation of Erythropoietin Gene Expression As mentioned before, EPO is a glycoprotein hormone essential for regulating erythropoiesis—the production of red blood cells. It is primarily produced by the kidneys (interstitial fibroblast-like cells), although during fetal development the liver is the major site of synthesis. The expression of EPO is tightly controlled to ensure that red blood cell mass and oxygen transport match the body’s metabolic demands. Oxygen availability is the primary regulatory signal, although inflammatory, hormonal and epigenetic factors also influence EPO production. Furthermore, the key oxygen-sensing mechanism is the HIF pathway. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-α subunits are hydroxylated by PHDs, which allows the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) complex to recognize them and mark them for breakdown by the cell [ 69 Under hypoxic conditions, PHD activity is suppressed, stabilizing HIF-α, which translocates to the nucleus, dimerizes with HIF-β, and binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) on the EPO gene promoter, enhancing transcription. Other modulators include inflammatory cytokines, androgens, and specific signaling molecules like PI3K and MAPK pathways [ 70 71 72 Under hypoxic conditions, PHD enzymes become inactive due to lack of oxygen, allowing HIF-α to stabilize, dimerize with HIF-β (ARNT), and translocate to the nucleus. This complex binds to HREs in the EPO gene promoter, activating its transcription [ 70 73 Positive regulators: androgens, which increase EPO production, contributing to sex differences in hematocrit; IL-6 and other cytokines, which may enhance EPO expression under certain conditions; and HIF stabilizers (e.g., roxadustat, daprodustat), which inhibit PHDs and mimic hypoxia to induce EPO. Negative regulators: chronic inflammation—cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α suppress EPO transcription; and CKD—loss of EPO-producing cells leads to anemia [ 74 The EPO gene is subject to epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation and histone modifications. Hypermethylation of the EPO promoter can repress its transcription. Histone acetylation and methylation patterns also influence chromatin accessibility and HIF binding [ 75 6. Recombinant Erythropoietin in the Context of Gene Doping Recent progress in genomics has facilitated the development of gene therapies aimed at correcting or replacing genes involved in essential physiological processes, thereby improving the production of biologically active compounds with limited natural activity. Such therapeutic applications include the stimulation of erythropoiesis and the biosynthesis of recombinant endogenous proteins, such as insulin [ 76 However, unregulated manipulation of genetic material may induce significant metabolic disturbances that pose health risks. In this context, doping refers to the illicit use of pharmacological substances and methods—contrary to established regulations—with the intent to artificially enhance physical performance. The term “doping” first appeared in 1889 in a dictionary, describing a stimulant mixture containing opium, reportedly used to improve the performance of racehorses. RHuEPO was originally developed to treat various forms of anemia but was later misappropriated for performance enhancement in sports. This misuse led to the development of novel EPOR agonists and mimetic compounds that mimic cytokine hormones while lacking a defined protein structure. To enhance detection and pharmacological properties, rHuEPO was biopharmaceutically modified by the addition of carbohydrate chains or polyethylene glycol, thereby refining testing methods used in standard anti-doping protocols [ 77 The identification of doping agents presented further challenges due to the prolonged biological effects of anabolic steroids, which may exceed the detection window in biological samples. Advances in the understanding of end-metabolite pharmacokinetics have improved the detection of steroid abuse. Simultaneously, doping practices evolved alongside research into novel compounds with performance-enhancing potential, including recombinant peptide hormones and related agents [ 76 Testing methods recognized by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which incorporate additional biomarkers, have proven effective in enforcing anti-doping regulations in sports. These include the detection of transgenes, specific biochemical analytes, and characteristic serum steroid profiles. Ongoing research also addresses unintentional violations of anti-doping rules and the potential for misinterpretation of test results [ 78 In gene therapy, targeting the genetic material of somatic cells is considered safer, as the modifications are limited to the individual and are not inherited, unlike alterations in germline cells, which result in heritable genetic changes. The transfer of genetic information can be accomplished through viral vectors—offering benefits such as efficient cell entry and replication—or through non-viral methods, such as electroporation, where an electric field increases cell membrane permeability and facilitates DNA uptake [ 76 Techniques derived from genetic engineering and applied in gene doping have been shown to enhance both hematologic and anabolic parameters, leading to increases in muscle mass and physical strength. Specifically, overexpression of the EPO gene, which encodes a glycoprotein hormone, triggers physiological adaptations including elevated red blood cell count, enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity, and improved endurance performance. Gene doping involves introducing the EPO gene into the body using viral vectors, leading to the overexpression of erythropoietin by encoding proteins that influence oxygen homeostasis. This artificial stimulation of erythropoiesis in the liver and kidneys enhances tissue oxygenation and increases hematocrit levels. However, such elevations in red blood cell count carry serious health risks, including the potential for stroke, myocardial infarction, thrombosis, and elevated peripheral vascular resistance [ 76 Gene doping also presents significant concerns regarding adverse effects. These include unintended alterations in genetic material, such as mutations, or the potential for oncogenesis due to incorrect integration of the introduced gene into the host genome. Detecting gene doping remains a critical challenge. Current research efforts are focused on identifying the presence of viral vectors, analyzing gene expression profiles for doping-induced changes, conducting proteomic profiling, and distinguishing between naturally occurring proteins and those produced through recombinant or transgenic techniques. The intake of protein products highlights the increase in resistance, physical strength, muscle mass, regulates the growth and/or regeneration of muscle tissue and encodes peptides that relieve pain [ 76 Clinical studies involving patients who were repeatedly administered rHuEPO recorded the development of antibodies that neutralize its contribution, a process that led to the appearance and development of PRCA [ 79 80 RHuEPO was marketed under various trade names, the synthesis of the product being related to the technology of the moment for obtaining the active substance. The treatment with rHuEPO depends on the health status of each patient and the specific therapeutic indications of the product used. The treatment is performed under the conditions of a medical staff specializing in the therapeutic approach to such situations. The therapeutic efficacy of rHuEPO could be determined by the ratio between hemoglobin level instability and the rate of reported adverse events. The major aim of the treatment is to maintain Hb levels within the range documented in the patient’s medical history, eliminating subjective interpretations. Furthermore, the treatment with rHuEPO must be preceded by a complex and thorough evaluation of the user, the administration of various forms of iron supplements, to ensure an optimal response of the body to the prescribed treatment, knowing the possible side effects. The beneficial effects of rHuEPO have expanded the scope of therapeutic hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic applications. The constant administration of rHuEPO has reduced the number of transfusions required in various surgical interventions and implicitly the risks related to donor issues. New ESAs have been developed, with an increased glycosylation potential, which has allowed the production of compounds with an extended half-life [ 79 The therapeutic use of rHuEPO requires careful monitoring of the patient’s health prior to the decision to use it therapeutically and in accordance with approved clinical guidelines. Treatment with rHuEPO aims to achieve a recommended Hb range of 10–12 g/dL. Adjustment of the prescribed dose will 21 aim to achieve a Hb level between 10 g/dL–12 g/dL, with an initial dose of 50–150 units/kg, with a maintenance dose of 40 units/kg. If the Hb level exceeds 13 g/dL, treatment should be stopped until the Hb level falls below 13 g/dL, with a correction phase and a maintenance phase. The treatment with rHuEPO for children usually requires higher doses than those for adults for a similar Hb response (doses decrease as the body weight and age of the children increase). This situation is determined by the plasma clearance rate (it relates to the speed of purification of a drug according to its concentration in biological fluids). Clinical studies included in the rHuEPO use authorization programs have recommended monitoring of patients undergoing treatment in order to keep Hb levels within physiological limits, to avoid possible cardiovascular effects. In the event that Hb levels remain below physiological limits, patient monitoring will be based on individual case histories and the recommendations of the pharmaceutical manufacturers [ 81 Advances in the pharmaceutical industry have allowed the administration of rHuEPO in a single dose over a week, using ESAs with an increased half-life, allowing the transition to a weekly dose. The use of a single weekly dose has in most cases shown a decrease in Hb levels, which has required the need to adjust the dose so as to reach the recommended physiological values, a situation that is not reported in clinically stable patients, who did not require an increase in the dose. The adjustment of the correction dose to reach normal biological Hb values, in the case of hemodialysis-dependent patients, will be performed in stages, provided that one stage will take place over a minimum of 4 weeks [ 79 Clinical administration of rHuEPO has highlighted physiological and metabolic changes related to EPO intake, the possible consequences of alternative treatment with an impact on the amplification of endogenous erythropoietin production. The offers of the pharmaceutical industry highlight a dynamic in which the emergence of new biosimilars and new therapeutic modalities are related to discoveries in the field of molecular biology. These opportunities are aimed at differentiating products adapted to different life cycle options (aiming at improving therapeutic standards). The mechanism of the main rHuEPOs currently used is shown in Table 2 The therapeutic use of rHuEPO requires monitoring possible side effects caused by its intake into the body, the medical particularities of each patient, and the recommendations of the pharmaceutical manufacturers for each product. Multiple clinical studies that were the basis for obtaining the marketing authorization for rHuEPO under various trade names did not highlight the interactions of this compound with other drugs or other forms of interaction that would influence the metabolism of other drugs. The pharmacokinetic properties of rHuEPO are presented in Table 3 RHuEPO therapy covers a very broad therapeutic spectrum, with specific features for each product, including the amplification of pharmacological effects in the event of overdose or very high plasma concentrations with side effects included in the manufacturer’s package insert. The safety data of rHuEPO are presented in Table 4 Furthermore, the mechanism of action of rHuEPO is involved in the phases of erythroid development, the development of erythroid precursors, binding to their receptors, and the activation of transduction channels that stimulate erythroid cell proliferation. Pharmacokinetic data provided by clinical studies have highlighted a series of specific common elements and particularities of each type of epoetin administered in relation to the specific characteristics of the user’s health condition. Toxicological studies have recorded preclinical safety data that allowed EMA or FDA approval. The ability of testing methods to detect rHuEpo is dependent on the performance of the assays, the ability to collect samples within a time frame that allows detection of the substances, and the doping methods used [ 89 59 90 7. Effect of EPO on Glucose Metabolism While EPO is primarily known for its role in red blood cell production, recent studies have uncovered its metabolic effects beyond erythropoiesis. EPO appears to exert beneficial effects on glucose metabolism by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing glucose uptake, and modulating lipid metabolism. These pleiotropic actions are of growing interest in the context of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. Recent studies revealed that EPO plays a role in glucose regulation independent of its erythropoietic function. EPO administration improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. It enhances GLUT4 translocation, promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PGC-1α. These effects suggest a direct action of EPO on peripheral tissue glucose utilization and systemic metabolic health [ 68 7.1. Mechanisms of EPO Action on Glucose Homeostasis EPO acts on various peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver to regulate glucose metabolism. The underlying mechanisms include activation of signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt, AMPK, and STAT5, which converge on key metabolic targets, including the stimulation of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane; enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation; suppression of inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue; and reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis [ 22 7.2. Tissue-Specific Effects of EPO EPO enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and utilization in skeletal muscle, partly via the PI3K/Akt and AMPK pathways. This contributes to improved systemic glucose tolerance. In adipose tissue, EPO reduces macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine production, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization. EPO has been shown to reduce gluconeogenic gene expression (e.g., PEPCK, G6Pase), contributing to lower hepatic glucose output. These effects may be mediated via activation of the AKT pathway. Emerging evidence suggests EPO may exert cytoprotective effects on pancreatic β-cells, supporting their function and survival in the context of hyperglycemia or oxidative stress [ 91 7.3. Metabolic Effects of EPO in Mouse Models In mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance, EPO administration led to improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. These effects were independent of hematocrit changes, suggesting a direct metabolic role. In vitro studies in myotubes and adipocytes have confirmed EPO’s ability to stimulate glucose uptake and enhance mitochondrial respiration [ 92 7.4. Clinical Implications Although (rHuEPO) is not approved for treating metabolic diseases, its metabolic effects are of interest for potential therapeutic strategies against type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome [ 93 94 HIF stabilizers, which also increase endogenous EPO levels, may have additional metabolic benefits that warrant further investigation [ 68 8. EPO as a Regulator of Metabolic Energy Pathways While EPO is classically recognized for stimulating erythropoiesis, recent studies have highlighted its broader role as a regulator of systemic energy metabolism, including the modulation of the overall metabolic balance [ 22 68 22 55 Beyond its role in red cell mass regulation, EPO has been implicated in systemic energy balance. EPO stimulates fatty acid oxidation and suppresses lipid accumulation. It promotes browning of white adipose tissue and enhances mitochondrial oxidative capacity. These effects are mediated through transcriptional regulators such as PGC-1α, SIRT1, and NRF1. The hormone is also thought to influence hypothalamic neurons, potentially affecting appetite and energy expenditure [ 95 8.1. Molecular Mechanisms of EPO in Energy Regulation EPO mediates its metabolic effects through EPORs, which activates downstream signaling pathways such as: Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (STAT5); Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway; AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); and Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [ 96 These signaling cascades ultimately influence mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and substrate metabolism. EPO has been shown to increase mitochondrial content and improve efficiency in several tissues, thereby enhancing aerobic capacity and energy utilization [ 95 8.2. Tissue-Specific Effects of EPO on Energy Metabolism EPO promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation in muscle cells. These effects contribute to increased endurance and reduced fat accumulation. EPO also upregulates the expression of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis [ 96 In white adipose tissue, EPO reduces inflammation, enhances mitochondrial function, and stimulates browning of fat. This transition from white to beige adipocytes increases thermogenic activity and energy expenditure [ 68 EPO modulates hepatic lipid metabolism by reducing triglyceride accumulation and improving insulin sensitivity. These actions help ameliorate hepatic steatosis in models of metabolic syndrome [ 55 In the hypothalamus, EPO may regulate appetite and systemic energy expenditure via neuronal EPOR signaling. Animal studies suggest EPO influences leptin sensitivity and neuroinflammation [ 68 8.3. Experimental and Clinical Evidence Multiple animal studies have demonstrated that EPO administration improves metabolic parameters in obese and insulin-resistant mice [ 68 Although data in humans are limited, some studies in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving recombinant human EPO have reported improved metabolic markers, suggesting potential translational relevance [ 96 8.4. Therapeutic Implications Understanding EPO’s role in energy regulation opens the door to potential new therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases. Pharmacological agents that enhance endogenous EPO production (e.g., HIF-PHD inhibitors) may offer dual benefits in anemia and energy metabolism disorders, though risks like erythrocytosis must be carefully managed [ 55 97 98 9. Pharmacological Insights into Blood Doping and Its Physiological Implications Blood doping is defined as an attempt to enhance performance by various methods that are not subjective to regulations. The attempt consists of using medical procedures such as blood transfusions and pharmaceutical products such as rHuEPO to enhance the capacity and endurance of athletes. The repercussions caused are the following: stimulation of red blood cell production and additional supply of oxygen to the muscle level by intervening on HIF; use of autologous blood transfusion, by collecting, processing and reinfusing one’s own blood, eliminating possible side effects; and use of artificial oxygen transporters at the tissue level, improving the oxygen supply to the muscular system. The most commonly used procedures in blood doping since 1989 remain the use of blood transfusions and the administration of rHuEPO [ 99 100 99 101 102 Blood transfusion is a medical procedure, an intravenous transfer, that consists of administering by injection to a person blood product from a donor (allogeneic transfusion) or from the same person (autotransfusion). The use of transfusion in the medical field has also shown interest to those interested in blood doping, with autotransfusion becoming a very frequently reported method of blood doping, given that it is much more difficult to detect. Autotransfusion, performed under inadequate conditions, poses risks, as it can cause volume overload or a reaction caused by antigen mismatch, causing the appearance of an immune response aimed at eliminating or neutralizing it [ 103 Blood doping attempts with homologous erythrocytes are easy to detect due to antigenic differences between the user and the donor. The cells are subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Several biomarkers are currently being investigated to highlight the use of autotransfusion as a doping method: analysis of circulating microRNA, changes in hepcidin, changes in biomarkers associated with the production of transcription during the biological process of message transcription, analysis of red microparticles in the blood. The presence in the urine collected from users of components existing in the plastic bags (in which the blood is stored) or of components existing in the plastic tubes (used in blood transfusion as a doping method) can be detected after the transfusion, indicating the use of blood doping as a fraudulent alternative to obtain performance in sports [ 104 Figure 3 105 Recent evidence highlights the potential role for the microNRA miR-223 in mediating the effects of uremic toxins on anemia in CKD patients. Uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate (IS) are building up in the bloodstream and are commonly associated with anemia in CKD. IS can affect the production of red blood cells in lab and animal models, thus impairing the effectiveness of EPO therapy. Both IS and microRNA miR-223 are linked to anemia in CKD. Many tests were conducted on human red blood cells precursors (UT7/EPO cells) and indicated that IS can cause an increase in miR-223. The same results were also confirmed in human CD34+ cells. Higher levels of miR-223 in the bloodstream are linked to blood vessel damage. As a result, miR-223 can contribute to anemia in CKD patients, possibly interfering with red blood cell production. Understanding this mechanism could lead to new treatments for anemia in CKD patients. miR-223 can serve as a biomarker for the early detection and monitoring of anemia-related cardiovascular disease during CKD progression. Understanding this pathway could help explain why some patients respond poorly to EPO treatments and could suggest new therapeutic strategies for, e.g., modulating miR-223 to improve EPO efficacy or reduce side effects [ 106 A variety of biomarkers are currently under investigation for their utility in detecting doping practices in sports. Among these, transcriptomic markers are particularly valuable for identifying early molecular responses to prohibited substances, as they capture gene expression changes that precede phenotypic alterations. Proteomic markers, on the other hand, provide insight into the modulation of specific protein levels associated with enhanced erythropoiesis or altered metabolism. Another critical category includes iron metabolism markers, which are indicative of disruptions in iron absorption, transport, and utilization—frequent targets of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents such as recombinant erythropoietin. Furthermore, metabolomic profiling enables the detection of shifts in small-molecule concentrations within biological fluids, offering a sensitive window into systemic metabolic changes induced by doping agents. Traditional hematological markers, such as Hb concentration and reticulocyte count, remain central to anti-doping strategies, particularly through integration into longitudinal monitoring frameworks like the Athlete Biological Passport. Lastly, alterations in red blood cell properties, including their mechanical flexibility and density, are increasingly being studied as indirect indicators of blood manipulation or pharmacologically enhanced erythropoiesis. 10. The Athlete’s Biological Passport The Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) is a concept introduced by WADA in 2009, aimed at identifying biological variables that require special attention, showcasing anti-doping investigations and testing and monitoring possible violations of doping regulations. The ABP is composed of a hematological and steroid module. Blood doping can alter the hematological parameters by increasing the reticulocyte, hematocrit counts, and EPO levels due to the amplification of red cell mass [ 107 108 109 The analytical methods used to detect the use of autotransfusion in blood doping aim to detect the presence of a new population of erythrocytes in the body of the person who has undergone such practices [ 110 Autologous transfusion involves the collection, storage, and subsequent reinfusion of one’s own blood, aiming to improve the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream [ 111 112 The values of metabolic parameters and electrolyte concentrations remained constant, which was attributed to the low volume of reinfused blood [ 112 113 114 115 116 Establishing an effective and credible testing system is fundamental to the integrity and efficacy of anti-doping efforts. Nevertheless, the relatively low rate of detection compared to the estimated actual prevalence of doping in sports has led to growing skepticism and criticism regarding the efficiency of current testing frameworks. To be effective, anti-doping testing strategies must distinguish between preventive testing and targeted testing aimed at detecting the use of prohibited substances or methods. When the primary goal is detection, testing protocols should be driven by risk assessment and intelligence gathering, prioritizing the strategic quality of testing plans rather than the sheer volume of samples collected. In this context, the detection rate is a key performance indicator for evaluating the success of testing programs. Importantly, the number of individual athletes tested—rather than the total number of samples—provides a more accurate reflection of a testing program’s ability to identify doping behavior [ 117 The implementation of comprehensive anti-doping regulations serves to uphold fairness, transparency, and the protection of athlete health. In this regard, healthcare professionals, particularly pharmacists, can play a pivotal role in doping prevention. The strong rapport between athletes and healthcare providers facilitates the dissemination of accurate information, development of life skills, and promotion of informed decision-making, ultimately reducing both intentional and unintentional anti-doping rule violations [ 118 119 120 11. Regulatory Role of Erythropoietin in Iron Metabolism and Homeostasis Iron distribution and accumulation within the human body play a fundamental role in the regulation of erythropoiesis. Total body iron content typically ranges from 3 to 5 g, partitioned among ferritin stores—primarily hepatic (approximately 20%), hemoglobin within circulating erythrocytes (around 70%), and enzymatic or other protein-bound forms (about 10%) [ 121 121 Ferritin concentrations serve as key indicators of iron storage status. Low ferritin levels reflect depleted iron reserves, often culminating in iron-deficiency anemia, whereas elevated levels are associated with iron overload conditions, such as liver and cardiac diseases, chronic inflammation, or infection [ 122 EPO significantly accelerates erythropoiesis. However, studies have demonstrated that exogenous administration of EPO can disrupt iron homeostasis. Notably, plasma ferritin levels may not accurately reflect total iron stores in the context of recombinant EPO administration [ 123 124 123 Differentiating the effects of various ESAs on iron utilization underscores the need for advanced analytical frameworks to monitor treatment responses. For instance, correlations between iron supplementation routes (oral vs. intravenous) and plasma hepcidin modulation offer valuable insights into ESA efficacy and iron handling [ 123 124 Given the complexity of iron regulation under ESA therapy, ongoing refinement of biomarker panels is essential. Current iron indices provide incomplete data for some patient populations, thus underscoring the need for additional biomarkers to improve diagnostic precision [ 125 126 While EPO and related therapies reduce the incidence of adverse hematologic events, their effects on ferritin and serum iron levels necessitate a precise understanding of iron homeostasis and its therapeutic manipulation. Iron plays a pivotal role in cellular functions, and imbalances in its metabolism are linked to pathological states. Iron overload is associated with hereditary hemochromatosis and thalassemia, whereas deficiency results in various forms of anemia. Excessive iron contributes to oxidative stress via increased production of reactive oxygen species, ultimately causing tissue damage and increasing the risk of neurodegenerative, hepatic, pancreatic, and cardiovascular disorders [ 127 In the case of inadequate iron intake, Hb synthesis is impaired, leading to diminished oxygen transport capacity. Restoring iron stores through dietary supplementation supports erythropoiesis and maintains systemic oxygen delivery [ 124 Alcohol consumption has been shown to influence iron metabolism. In a study involving the intake of 300 mL of red wine daily for three weeks (preceded by a two-week abstention), reductions in serum hepcidin were observed in both healthy individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes, accompanied by increased EPO levels. Erythroferrone levels rose significantly in the diabetic cohort, indicating activation of the EPO–erythroferrone–hepcidin axis. These molecular changes correlated with an increase in red cell distribution width in both groups and higher reticulocyte counts in diabetic participants. This suggests that moderate red wine consumption may positively influence iron regulation through this hormonal pathway [ 128 These findings support the hypothesis that moderate red wine intake may confer cardiometabolic benefits, particularly in individuals with type 2 diabetes, as suggested by numerous epidemiological and interventional studies in humans. Such effects may contribute to the prevention or amelioration of diet-related non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disorders and diabetes mellitus type 2 [ 128 12. Cutting-Edge Perspectives on Erythropoietin Mechanisms and Use EPO ranks among the costliest elements used in the treatment of anemia. To overcome this inconvenience researchers were able to create synthetic EPO receptors by employing design-build-test cycles alongside genome editing. The new synthetic receptors are able to enable the erythropoiesis process. Thus, the production of red blood cells can be more affordable [ 129 As a result, EPO produced by tumors can stimulate the EPO/EPOR signaling pathway in macrophages found in a tumor microenvironment (TME). Because of that, the immune response is diminished by decreasing the T cell infiltration and functionality. Consequently, the EPO/EPOR pathway represents a significant barrier to effective antitumor immunity and is under exploration as a possible therapeutic target to boost immune responses and enhance treatment results in HCC. The EPO/EPOR signaling in macrophages that is able to create a noninflamed tumor immunotype is presented in Figure 4 130 EPO signaling plays a critical role in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment (TME), particularly through its effects on macrophage polarization. Tumor-derived EPO can bind to EPORs expressed on macrophages, inducing an immunosuppressive phenotype. This shift promotes the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), suppresses proinflammatory responses, and contributes to the establishment of an immunologically “cold” TME, which impairs effective anti-tumor immunity. Conversely, inhibition of the EPO–EPOR axis reprograms macrophages toward a proinflammatory state, fostering a “hot” TME that supports T-cell activation and anti-tumoral responses. Clinically, ESAs are approved for the management of chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with nonhematologic malignancies, aiming to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. However, ESA use is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic complications and elevated mortality. To mitigate these risks, guidelines recommend initiating treatment at Hb levels below 10 g/dL and avoiding Hb levels above 12 g/dL during therapy [ 131 Beyond oncology, EPO is extensively utilized in the treatment of anemia associated with CKD. It contributes to metabolic homeostasis by promoting lipolysis and suppressing lipogenic gene expression [ 68 132 Daprodustat, a novel HIF-PHD inhibitor recently approved by the FDA, exhibits non-inferiority to rHuEPO for anemia treatment in hemodialysis patients [ 133 134 Hemodialysis patients with advanced CKD are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, where inflammation-induced EPO resistance complicates anemia treatment. Temporary EPO resistance during COVID-19 infection necessitates personalized therapeutic strategies, including the use of HIF stabilizers [ 135 136 137 Beyond hematopoiesis, EPO exhibits tissue-protective properties through interaction with the tissue-protective receptor (TPR), suppressing proinflammatory cytokines and inhibiting apoptosis. It enhances wound healing and rebalances T helper cell responses [ 138 139 140 Genetic variations in the EPO and EPOR loci have been associated with erythrocytosis, defined by elevated RBC mass, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels. Primary erythrocytosis, as seen in polycythemia vera, presents with suppressed EPO due to intrinsic hematopoietic stem cell abnormalities, while secondary erythrocytosis is marked by elevated or inappropriately normal EPO in response to hypoxia or ectopic production [ 141 142 Elevated EPO levels have also been observed in sepsis, where its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective roles help attenuate immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and tissue injury. Non-survivors of sepsis often exhibit higher endogenous EPO concentrations, correlating with tissue hypoperfusion [ 143 Neuroprotective applications of EPO have been investigated in neonatal hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). While some studies suggest benefits when used alone or in combination with therapeutic hypothermia (TH), others report limited impact on mortality or neurodevelopmental outcomes, with some studies even indicating increased adverse events [ 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 EPOR expression in both normal and malignant tissues implicates it in mitochondrial regulation and tumor progression. In cancer cells, EPOR signaling modulates mitochondrial biogenesis via pAKT and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), highlighting its significance in tumor bioenergetics [ 152 During pregnancy, EPO is utilized to manage iron-deficiency anemia, often in conjunction with iron supplementation to optimize hematologic outcomes [ 153 154 Despite its central role in oxygen homeostasis and erythropoiesis, the molecular underpinnings of renal EPO production remain incompletely characterized, limiting therapeutic advancements for anemia [ 155 Glucocorticoids (GCs) also modulate erythropoiesis by enhancing EPO sensitivity in progenitor cells and promoting proliferation under stress. Their influence is evident in disorders such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Genetic and epigenetic determinants of GC responsiveness remain under investigation. GC deficiency in Addison’s disease results in anemia, while excess in Cushing’s syndrome may cause erythrocytosis [ 156 62 Finally, EPO expression is influenced not only by hypoxia through the oxygen- sensing pathway but also by hormonal regulation via the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), with angiotensin II upregulating EPO mRNA and protein in renal tubules [ 157 158 13. Conclusions The development of erythropoiesis, within normal parameters, depends on the supply of a protein hormone, EPO [ 159 The production of EPO in the body is induced under conditions of deficient oxygen supply to the tissues (caused by biological dysfunctions that affect the erythropoiesis process). Research on substances with doping potential requires a permanent effort that involves: reporting on current innovations and technology, monitoring aspects related to analytical sensitivity, exhaustiveness of target analytes, differentiating natural/endogenous substances from structurally identical ones or differentiating synthetic derived compounds. Routine anti-doping controls consider testing biological samples. The data found in the matrix of the collected samples allow monitoring of organic and inorganic analytes with various molecular masses. Diversification of anti-doping testing instruments and methods aims to analyze and evaluate new parameters found in an alternative matrix. The continuous optimization of analytical approaches, using innovative processes and technologies, aims to understand the final and intermediate products of metabolic transformations. The optimal ranges for detecting compounds with doping potential are determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based assays. These aspects highlight the complexity and scale of the challenges in the effort to detect these substances (e.g., steroid hormones, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, target analytes of gene doping, anabolic agents, peptide hormones, stimulants, etc.). The concerns in the field have targeted innovative technologies for detecting compounds with doping potential (e.g., remote testing, reproduction of metabolic systems, profiling of serum steroids or exploring gene editing methods, etc.). The intake of ergogenic supplements initially had a therapeutic role; later, they were used in doping practices. The effects induced by erythropoietin and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on the problem of iron assimilation and availability and the erythropoiesis process shape the way to new analytical approaches. The management of therapeutic aspects related to iron deficiency in the body is reported to the use of rHuEPO, other ESAs or iron-based supplements, achieving stimulation of the erythropoiesis process and iron availability in the body, reductions in ferritin levels (a form of iron storage in the body), and increases in serum iron levels in the body [ 160 Personalized medicine is reshaping the landscape of EPO therapy. A deep understanding of EPO’s pleiotropic mechanisms, genetic determinants of response, and emerging pharmacological tools will enable more effective, safer, and patient-centric treatments. Future research should aim to refine predictive models and expand therapeutic applications of EPO in both hematologic and non-hematologic domains.
