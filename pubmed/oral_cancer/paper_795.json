Introduction Inflammation represents the immune system’s response to protect the organism against foreign harmful stimuli including pathogens, damaged cells, toxic compounds and irradiation. Inflammation is primarily classified as acute and chronic [ 1 Notae vero inflammationis sunt quatuor: rubor et tumor cum calore and dolore 2 The inflammatory process produces a series of chemical mediators are activated that cause an increase in vascular permeability, leukocyte infiltration, followed by the synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites, release of cytokines and adhesion molecules that cause the stimulation of other mediators and start chemotaxis [ 3 1 Current therapy for inflammatory diseases is limited to the steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. However, prolonged use of these drugs may produce many adverse effects. There is an important need to develop new anti-inflammatory agents with selective action and fewer side effects. Flavonoids are plant secondary metabolites that are ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables, seeds, and plants. These polyphenolic compounds possess a basic 15-carbon skeleton and can be represented as C 6 3 6 4 5 The structural substitution in the flavonoid ring system is relevant to test their biological properties in search of more potent drug candidates. The chemical nature of flavonoids depends on their structural class, degree of hydroxylation, other substitutions and conjugations, and degree of polymerization [ 6 Although there is a considerable amount of data in the literature, it remains challenging to identify a clear trend that would lead to an optimized structure with high activity and low toxicity [ 7 1 To further enhance the pharmacological efficacy of natural prenylated flavanones, different structural modifications are being explored as a strategy to develop analogues that are more effective. For instance, Andrade-Carrera, B. et al. synthesized a series of analogues from the flavanone (2 S Eysenhardtia platycarpa 8 Regulatory mechanisms that contribute the progression of inflammation to cancer, it plays a crucial role in altering the tumour microenvironment, which in turn promotes tumour proliferation and rapid progression [ 9 10 In this context, Dominguez-Villegas, V. et al. reported the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of prenylated flavanones, isolated from the methanolic extract of leaves of Eysenhardtia platycarpa 11 Building on these findings, there is growing interest in investigating the critical structural features of prenylated flavanones for the design of new, more potent anti-inflammatory analogues. Moreover, recent advances in structure–activity relationship (SAR) and in silico modelling have provided valuable insights into the anti-inflammatory potential of flavonoids. SAR studies have highlighted that specific substitutions, such as hydroxylation patterns, prenylation, and methoxylation, can significantly influence bioactivity by modulating molecular interactions with key inflammatory targets such as COX-2, iNOS, and NF-κB [ 12 13 14 Additionally, ADME prediction tools have been widely used to support the design and selection of new flavonoid analogues with optimized biological profiles. These computational approaches allow prediction of binding modes, interaction energies, and pharmacokinetic properties, complementing experimental data and guiding the rational development of more effective anti-inflammatory agents [ 15 Considering the potential anti-inflammatory of flavanones isolated from E. platycarpa 1 2 1a 1d 2a 2d Figure 1 The objective of the present study was to evaluate of the anti-inflammatory activity of these flavonoid analogues ( 1 1a 1d 2 2a 2d 2. Results 2.1.

Pharmacomodulation Pharmacomodulation has been a strategy used in Medicinal Chemistry for drug design, with the aim of improving the pharmacological potential. Once the lead compound is identified, a rational therapeutic strategy is developed to avoid the use of inactive compounds [ 17 Moreover, the application of a consistent pharmacological or biochemical assessment method across a series of compounds is of considerable economic and scientific significance. This approach facilitates more accurate comparisons of activities and enables the development of more reliable structure–activity relationships [ 18 1 2 2.2.1.

Physicochemical Property Determination The physicochemical properties of the natural flavanones ( 1 2 1a 1d 2a 2d Table 1 2.4. In Silico Analyses In silico prediction of ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) properties was carried out using SwissADME. The evaluated parameters included gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, Cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition, topological polar surface area (TPSA), lipophilicity (Log P), and water solubility. These molecular descriptors provide valuable insights into the drug-likeness, oral bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic feasibility of the natural flavanones ( 1 2 1a 1d 2a 2d Table 2 Table 3 The predicted ADME profiles suggest that the structural modifications introduced, such as prenylation, methoxylation, and acetylation, influence key pharmacokinetic parameters, potentially enhancing the bioavailability and metabolic behaviour of these compounds. In addition, the in silico studies allowed the prediction and evaluation of natural flavanones ( 1 2 1a 1d 2a 2d Table 4 Together, these in silico predictions support the hypothesis that structural modifications introduced in the analogues ( 1a 1d 2a 2d 2.5. In Vivo Anti-Inflammatory Activity Assay The results obtained in the anti-inflammatory evaluation of natural flavanones ( 1 2 1a 1b 1c 1d 2a 2b 2c 2d Table 5 3. Discussion 3.1. Acetylation Natural flavanones ( 1 2 1a 2a 19 8 Figure 2 Acetylation is a well-established strategy in medicinal chemistry to modify hydroxyl groups, thereby increasing lipophilicity and improving the potential for membrane permeability, which is an essential property for drug-like candidates [ 18 23 From a mechanistic perspective, acetylation proceeds through a nucleophilic substitution, where the hydroxyl groups of the flavanones attack the carbonyl carbon of acetic anhydride, resulting in the formation of acetyl esters. Pyridine facilitates this transformation by activating the hydroxyl groups and neutralizing acidic by-products [ 19 The reactivity of the hydroxyl groups is also influenced by their electronic environment. In particular, the C-5 hydroxyl group is activated by intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the neighbouring C-4 carbonyl, which enhances its susceptibility to acetylation. This selectivity underscores the importance of local electronic effects in guiding semi-synthetic modifications of flavonoids [ 24 25 3.2. Methylation Methylation is a relevant strategy in medicinal chemistry because, by introducing methyl groups through the elimination of hydrogen and subsequent alkylation, the polarity of molecules is usually reduced, thereby increasing their lipophilicity. This structural modification can also affect recognition by endogenous and exogenous biomolecules through interactions with bioreceptors [ 20 26 27 28 In the present study, natural flavanones ( 1 2 1b 2b Figure 3 O 2 29 1 13 1b 2b 8 The reactivity of hydroxyl groups in flavanones toward functionalization reactions such as acetylation and methylation is strongly influenced by the electronic characteristics of neighbouring substituents, particularly the carbonyl at C-4. Although both reactions involve nucleophilic substitution at hydroxyl groups, their mechanisms differ significantly. Acetylation is facilitated by the activation of the hydroxyl group at C-5 through chelation with the C-4 carbonyl, whereas methylation generally requires less electrophilic activation and does not benefit from such stabilizing interactions [ 29 24 25 3.3. Cyclization Cyclization is a widely used strategy in drug design, particularly valuable for studying the active conformation of flexible molecules. By restricting conformational freedom, this modification can stabilize the molecular scaffold, potentially improving selectivity and interaction with biological targets. However, it can also introduce new structural elements that may alter both biological activity and physicochemical properties, as well as generate new stereogenic centres [ 17 In this study, natural flavanones ( 1 2 1c 2c Figure 4 8 30 Analogue ( 1c 31 2c 1 2 13 2 Taken together, these data demonstrate the formation of a cyclized analogue. Analogue ( 2c 8 3.4. Vinylogous-Cyclization The principle of vinylogy can be explained as a consequence of resonance and has been successfully applied to conjugated systems, including imines, aromatic compounds, and alkynyl groups. However, the presence of vinyl groups introduces challenges due to their higher metabolic reactivity, which can lead to the formation of potentially toxic metabolites. Additionally, vinylogous cyclization can induce significant geometric and electronic changes, restricting conformational flexibility and increasing rigidity in cyclic systems [ 17 In this study, natural flavanones ( 1 2 1d 2d Figure 5 22 Mechanistically, vinylogous cyclization involves a π-electron delocalization-driven intramolecular attack, in which the electron-rich hydroxyl group interacts with the conjugated double bond of the prenyl substituent. This leads to the formation of a new pyran ring, restricts conformational flexibility, and changes the hybridization of carbons C-9 and C-10 from sp 3 2 The structures of analogues ( 1d 2d 1 1d 2d 13 1d 2d Taken together, these data demonstrate the successful formation of novel vinylogously cyclized derivative.

Structure–Activity Relationship (SAR), Drug-likeness and Biological Implications The physicochemical and in silico analyses of natural flavanones ( 1 2 1a 1d 2a 2d The analogues ( 1a 1d 2a 2d 1 2 1a 2a 32 In addition, the heat of formation (H°f) values were also more negative for analogues, particularly ( 2a 33 The dipole moment (µ), an important factor in determining intermolecular interactions, solubility and biological target recognition, was highest for analogue ( 2c 34 1c 2c 35 From a drug-likeness perspective, all compounds satisfied the criteria defined by Lipinski’s Rule of Five, indicating potential for good oral bioavailability [ 36 According to HyperChem, Log P values ranged from −1.43 ( 2d 1b 2d 1a 1a 2d 37 Overall, the range of Log P values across the series indicates a favourable balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, which is desirable during lead optimization. Compounds with Log P values around 2 to 3 are often ideal for oral drug candidates due to a suitable balance between permeability and solubility. In the in vivo anti-inflammatory evaluation using the TPA-induced mouse ear edema model, several compounds demonstrated potent activity, particularly analogues ( 2c 2d 1c The high efficacy of these compounds can be linked to their computationally predicted physicochemical properties. For instance, analogue ( 2c 18 38 Moreover, the electronic reactivity of analogue ( 2c 39 40 Structurally, the chemical modifications introduced in the analogues, particularly methoxylation and prenylation, proved essential in enhancing anti-inflammatory activity. These groups modulated molecular polarity, size, and electronic properties without compromising drug-likeness. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that strategic substitutions on flavonoid scaffolds can significantly improve both biological efficacy and pharmacokinetics [ 41 In contrast, natural flavanone ( 1 1a 42 3.5.1. ADME Properties and Predicted Drug Behaviour SwissADME analysis demonstrated that all compounds ( 1 2 1a 1d 2a 2d 1c 2b 2c 1a 2a 43 Topological polar surface area (TPSA) values for all compounds were under 90 Å 2 44 With respect to metabolic predictions, several compounds were forecasted to inhibit cytochrome P450 isoforms, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. While this raises concerns regarding potential drug–drug interactions, it could also imply a longer half-life and prolonged therapeutic effect, though this would require confirmation via in vivo pharmacokinetics [ 45 Water solubility predictions (Log S) indicated moderate solubility for analogues such as ( 2d 2b 46 3.5.2. Predicted Biological Activity via PASS Online PASS Online analysis supported the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of the analogues, especially analogues ( 1b 1c 2b 2c Analogue ( 2c These functions are crucial, as NOS2 (inducible nitric oxide synthase) is a pro-inflammatory enzyme whose overexpression leads to nitric oxide–mediated tissue damage. Likewise, inhibition of lipid peroxidation can prevent membrane destabilization and interrupt the inflammatory cascade [ 47 48 Analogue ( 1c Interestingly, while indomethacin showed strong in vivo efficacy (91.00%), its predicted PASS activities in antioxidant-related pathways were significantly lower (e.g., free radical scavenging: Pa = 0.151; cytoprotection: Pa = 0.285). This suggests that indomethacin acts primarily through COX inhibition, while the analogues may achieve broader therapeutic benefits through multi-pathway modulation, which is particularly valuable in chronic inflammatory conditions [ 49 3.5.3. Structure–Activity Relationships and In Silico–In Vivo Correlation There was a strong correlation between the in silico predictions and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity, validating the predictive power of the computational models. The most active analogues are ( 2c 2d 1c 2 In contrast, natural flavanone ( 1 1a Ultimately, this study highlights the utility of integrated in silico platforms, including SwissADME and PASS Online, in guiding the rational design of flavonoid-based drug candidates.
