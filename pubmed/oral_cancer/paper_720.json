While they can be toxic, their neurotoxicity is less understood. The aim of this study was to treat differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells with Bisphenol S (BPS) and Bisphenol F (BPF) to investigate mechanisms of toxicity. BPS reduced cell viability (>50 µM at 48 h) more than BPF (>200 µM at 48 h), with concentration- and time-dependent effects. Both induced caspase 3/7 activity at 250 µM after 48 h, though no changes were observed in levels of reactive oxygen species nor mitochondrial ATPase activity. RNA-seq analysis at 0.1 nM revealed distinct transcriptional networks: BPS altered IL15R, causing NF-kB/NFATC activation, and triggered NF-kB signaling through CD8, while BPF affected TLR9 and activated NF-kB targets through TNF. Pathway analysis showed that genes involved in neuroinflammation, protein folding, microglial function, and motor neuron regulation were disrupted, demonstrating that BPS and BPF, even at low, environmentally relevant concentrations, significantly alter gene expression in pathways linked to neuroinflammation, immune signaling, and neurodegenerative diseases. BPS primarily affected ribosomal and immune-related networks, while BPF disrupted oxidative phosphorylation and protein-folding pathways. These alterations suggest mechanisms for long-term neurological effects, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluations of BPA alternatives. bisphenol replacements neuro-immune interactions RNA-seq xenobiotics caspase activity acute toxicity tests University of Florida and the College of Veterinary Medicine UF Graduate School Fellowship (GSF) This research was funded by The University of Florida and the College of Veterinary Medicine provided funding as start-up funding (C.J.M).

Introduction Polycarbonate plastics containing Bisphenol A (BPA) were once widely used in manufactured products such as babies’ and children’s plastic cups, water bottles, plastic wraps, pre-packaged food containers, and sealants of the inner lining of metal cans; however, there is strong evidence of widespread BPA-induced reproductive dysfunction in wildlife (i.e., fish species [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Due to the restrictions and/or bans of BPA usage in several countries, bisphenol replacements are used extensively in plastic products. These “BPA alternatives” are those primarily containing two hydroxyphenyl functionalities (i.e., bisphenol B, F, G, S, P, Z). BPF, for example, is useful in epoxy coatings needed for flooring, linings for storage tanks, road coverings, industrial adhesives and grouts, water pipes, and electrical varnishes [ 10 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Recently, concerns have been raised regarding the exposure effects of BPA replacement chemicals in relation to neurodevelopment and neurotoxicity of wildlife and humans. Studies have detected BPA and BPF in the human brain at concentrations up to 2.4 ng/g [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 The aim of the present study was to address knowledge gaps in how bisphenol replacements may affect the brain by improving our understanding of their neurotoxicity in neuronal cells; thus, we exposed human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to BPS and BPF. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells are valuable in in vitro models not only for their reliability in studying neuronal function and neurotoxicity, but also for the development of more physiologically relevant data compared to animal-derived cell lines. Additionally, we chose to focus on BPS and BPF, as these replacements are increasingly being utilized despite their full toxicity mechanisms remaining understudied. We hypothesized that both bisphenol replacements would induce neurotoxicity via (1) neuroinflammation and/or (2) oxidative stress, leading to disruption in mitochondrial membrane potential and the oxidative phosphorylation of SH-SY5Y cells. We also quantified the molecular response in cells using RNA-seq to elucidate mechanisms underlying any observed neurotoxicity at low concentrations to reflect concentrations in the human brain. 2.

Reactive Oxygen Species ROS was measured by two well established methods (Ros-Glo and DCFDA method) in SH-SY5Y cells, following a 4, 24, and 48 h exposure to one of several concentrations spanning 1 to 250 µM. Neither BPS nor BPF induced ROS following 4, 24, and 48 h exposure ( Figure 5 p 3.6. Mitochondrial Bioenergetics A mitochondrial stress test was conducted to measure oxygen consumption rates in cells following a 4 h direct injection exposure to one concentration of either BPS or BPF. We tested concentrations of BPS and BPF that ranged 0.1 nM to 250 µM. We hypothesized that BPS and BPF would alter oxidative consumption rates of SH-SY5Y cells: an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction. BPS did not affect oxygen consumption rates of SH-SY5Y mitochondria and did not affect oligomycin-induced ATP production nor maximum respiration ( Supplemental Figure S2 Supplemental Figure S3 p 3.7. Transcriptome Profiling in SH-SY5Y Cells Following BPS and BPF Exposure The transcriptomes obtained were overall of a high quality, generating 35.3–47.2 million raw reads per sample ( Supplemental Data Transcriptome patterns, in general, were unique amongst the three experimental groups (control, BPS and BPS) ( Figure 6 p Figure 6 Supplementary Data p Table 1 Enrichment analysis with KEGG pathways is depicted as bubble plots. The enrichment of KEGG pathways was consistent with the cell network enrichment analysis conducted in the Pathway Studio.

Discussion Bisphenol A has been restricted or banned in many countries because of the reported detrimental effects on human health associated with its exposure. Accordingly, derivatives (i.e., bisphenol B, E, F, and S) have been formulated to replace the utilization of BPA; however, limited data is available on the impact bisphenol derivatives have on toxicity mechanisms in neuronal cells. Neuronal cells can exhibit a varying degree of sensitivity towards chemical agents in different cell types; thus, it is important to elucidate different mechanisms of bisphenol-induced toxicity in cell types like neurons. Our data indicated that both BPS and BPF induce cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, and responses were both time- and concentration-dependent. Our data suggested that BPS was more cytotoxic (>50 µM at 48 h) to SH-SY5Y cells, compared to BPF (>200 µM at 48 h). Other studies also report cytotoxicity for bisphenol replacements in neuronal cells. Liang et al. [ 40 Other mammalian cells lines have been investigated for neurotoxicity of bisphenol replacements in rats and mice. Gill and Kumara [ 26 41 In our study, we did not observe any evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction (ROS production, MMP, ATPase activity) in SH-SY5Y cells following BPS and BPF exposure. These data suggest that mitochondria in SH-SY5Y cells may not be a primary target of BPS/BPF-induced toxicity; however, the mitochondria in other cell types may show increased sensitivity to bisphenol exposure. For instance, two other human neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR-32 and SK-N-SH) exposed to BPA, BPS, and BPB (1 nM up to 100 μM) for 24 h [ 27 bak1 bax cytc caspase-3 bcl2 42 43 44 As oxidative stress was not noted in the SH-SY5Y cells, we conducted a transcriptome analysis to identify other potential mechanisms related to BPS and BPF neurotoxicity. Our transcriptome analysis was conducted at a low concentration, relevant to potential exposures in the central nervous system [ 23 45 46 Both bisphenols affected pathways such as “PARK2/PINK1/UCHL1 in Young Onset Parkinson’s Disease”, “TNF activation of NF-kB Expression Targets”, and “Androgen Receptor/FKBP5 Signaling”. Kinch et al. [ 30 25 47 tnf , bace1 Based on the literature and databases that detail gene-protein interactions between entities, pathway analysis revealed that BPF impacted genes related to protein folding and BPS impacted genes related to microglia and motor neuron dysregulation. Most transcripts identified as being associated with a protein folding were downregulated and included Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 8 (HSPA8) and Member 14 (HSPA14), Heat Shock Protein 90 Alpha Family A Member 1 (HSP90AA1), and Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 70 (TOMM70), among others. On the other hand, BPS upregulated both A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domain 10 (ADAM10) and Domain 17 (ADAM17). Consequently, these genes promote microglial activation, which can contribute to neuroinflammation. Intriguingly, we found that both BPS and BPF affected pathways related to neuroinflammation, such as interleukin 2 (IL2), NF-κB, and TNF, and the two bisphenols are reported to impact similar pathways of in vivo and in vitro models; however, studies focus more on in vivo rodent models. Takahashi et al. [ 48 49 50 51 52 5. Conclusions In summary, we evaluated the relative toxicity of BPS and BPF in a widely used neuronal cell line for degenerative disease research. We noted that in general, BPS exerted higher toxicity to the cells, inducing cytotoxicity and reducing cell viability at lower concentrations than BPF. We tested the hypothesis that the mitochondria of neuronal cells were a major target of BPS and BPF toxicity; however, negative effects on mitochondria were not readily detected based upon mitochondrial membrane potential, assessment of ROS levels, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. This suggests that mitochondria may not be a direct target of BPS or BPF neurotoxicity, especially at low acute levels of exposure. Nevertheless, chronic low concentration exposures may still act to stress neurons and impair mitochondrial function. Limitations of this study must be considered. As SH-SY5Y cells are tumor-derived, they are more resistant to cellular stress; thus, they are less sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction. Consequently, this may explain why we did not observe mitochondrial dysfunction following BPF/S exposure, whereas other studies utilizing different neuronal cell types have reported such outcomes. Additional research using a range of neuronal models and in vivo systems is warranted to better understand these mechanisms. For example, future research utilizing additional neuronal cell models would be beneficial in understanding the neurotoxicity of BPF/S; nevertheless, SH-SY5Y cells are a valuable neurotoxicology cell model for the initial screening of cytotoxic effects, which can be terminally differentiated into a non-proliferative cell type with retinoic acid (in fact, this is a treatment for this type of cancer). In addition, cell lines are susceptible to genetic drift, and passage number is a crucial parameter. For these experiments, we ensured cells remained at a low passage number (<13). Lastly, one future step is to validate some of the key pathways (e.g., IL15R activating NF-kB/NFATC) using targeted pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA knockdown approaches to strengthen transcriptome data. Proteomics approaches can also be carried out to complement the transcriptomics data. We identified several molecular pathways that may underscore BPS-induced neurotoxicity at relevant levels, including IL15R activating NF-kB/NFATC signaling and CD8 activating NF-kB expression targets. Similarly, we identified several molecular pathways that may be involved in BPF-induced neurotoxicity, including TLR9 expression targets and TNF activation of NF-kB expression targets. RNA-seq analysis revealed that, despite high conservation between the molecules in the chemical structure, the bisphenol compounds perturb unique signaling pathways in neuronal cells. Thus, neuroinflammation may be a more prevalent mechanism of neurotoxicity for bisphenols relative to mitochondrial dysfunction but this hypothesis must be rigorously tested. Taken together, acute exposures to bisphenol replacements may not have notable consequences on the phenotype of SH-SY5Y neuronal cells; however, prolonged exposures may yield greater phenotypic responses and toxicity.
