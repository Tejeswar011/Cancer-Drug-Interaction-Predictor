Introduction FB is a diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedure frequently performed in patients with pulmonary diseases. Most individuals undergoing this procedure have underlying conditions that impair gas exchange, including pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, or lung cancer, which may result in the development or exacerbation of respiratory failure. During the procedure, the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO 2 1 2 These effects are even more pronounced during flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as aliquots of sterile saline are instilled and only partially retrieved, leaving a substantial volume within the alveoli. This significantly reduces the end-expiratory volume of the affected lung parenchyma below the functional residual capacity [ 1 2 3 4 Bronchoscopy also produces indirect haemodynamic effects. The increase in airway resistance and respiratory effort modifies intrathoracic pressures, which may compromise venous return and afterload, thereby reducing cardiac output. However, sympathetic activation typically results in an approximate 50% rise in cardiac output, which returns to baseline within 15 min following the procedure [ 5 6 7 Consequently, bronchoscopy represents a substantial cardiopulmonary risk in patients with respiratory or cardiac vulnerability, emphasising the need for an individualised oxygenation or respiratory support strategy. 2. Materials and Methods A comprehensive systematic search was undertaken in the PubMed and Cochrane databases, covering the period from 2000 to 2024. The search employed the following keywords: Bronchoscop and Respiratory Support, Bronchoscop and Oxygen, Bronchoscop and Non Invasive. Only studies published in English and involving adult human participants receiving one or more modalities of oxygen support during flexible bronchoscopy, for either diagnostic or interventional purposes, were considered. No limitations were imposed regarding the type of bronchoscopic procedure or the degree of anaesthetic risk. The studies that met the inclusion criteria consisted of randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published in peer-reviewed, indexed journals between 2000 and 2024 ( Figure 1 Table 1 Exclusion criteria included articles published in languages other than English, case reports or case series lacking control groups, cross-sectional studies, procedures performed without moderate to deep sedation, animal studies, paediatric populations, and studies involving rigid bronchoscopy, upper airway interventions, tracheal pathology, or invasive mechanical ventilation. Results are presented in a narrative synthesis, with interpretation and discussion of the published evidence. 3. Results The main findings of the included trials are summarised in Table 1 3.1. Modalities of Respiratory Support During Flexible Bronchoscopy During flexible bronchoscopy, several respiratory support modalities are employed. COT delivers low-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae, simple masks, or Venturi masks. HFT provides heated and humidified air/oxygen mixtures at flows up to 60 L/min, with an inspired oxygen fraction ranging from 21 to 100%. CPAP maintains positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) throughout the respiratory cycle via a mask, while NIV delivers ventilatory support through inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP and EPAP). Currently, no formal consensus or clinical guidelines exist regarding the optimal respiratory support strategy during flexible bronchoscopy. This study provides a narrative review of the current literature from PubMed and Cochrane, with the aim of outlining the respiratory support modalities most frequently used in clinical practice and offering recommendations adapted to patients’ specific clinical profiles. 3.1.1. Conventional Oxygen Therapy COT consists of delivering a fixed flow of oxygen, which blends with ambient air to satisfy the patient’s inspiratory flow requirements. Its main advantages include accessibility, low cost, and simplicity of use; however, a key limitation is the variability and unpredictability of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 When a patient’s peak inspiratory flow exceeds the oxygen flow provided by conventional systems, FiO 2 20 21 2 22 2 1 23 24 8 25 2 26 Nevertheless, owing to the rising number of severely ill patients with acute or chronic respiratory failure, advanced pulmonary disease, and cardiac comorbidities, conventional oxygen therapy frequently proves insufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation and prevent hypercapnia. 3.1.2. High-Flow Oxygen Therapy High-flow therapy (HFT) has been adopted in clinical practice as an effective alternative to COT for respiratory support during bronchoscopy. Its principal advantage lies in providing a more stable FiO 2 Secondly, HFT produces a modest PEEP within the airways, influenced by flow rate, upper airway anatomy, the patient’s nasal or oral breathing pattern, and the cannula-to-nare size ratio. This generates alveolar distension that improves end-expiratory lung volume and oxygenation in patients with diverse forms of acute respiratory failure (ARF) [ 27 28 HFT promotes a CO 2 29 HFT has been effectively utilised to prevent the worsening of ARF during bronchoscopy. Enhancements in SpO 2 Moreover, HFT has been demonstrated to decrease episodes of oxygen desaturation and the requirement for airway interventions, such as jaw-thrust manoeuvres or bag-mask ventilation, in patients at risk of hypoxaemia undergoing flexible bronchoscopy under deep sedation, including individuals with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), male sex, obesity, advanced age, or hypertension [ 9 30 Several studies have compared HFT with other oxygen delivery methods, particularly COT. In a randomised controlled trial involving lung transplant recipients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy for transbronchial biopsy, procedural interruptions occurred more frequently with low-flow nasal oxygen than with HFT [ 10 31 32 During BAL, the efficacy and safety of HFT compared with COT have been assessed in patients with ARF. No significant adverse events, including endotracheal intubation within 24 h post-procedure, were reported, nor were there notable differences between groups in transient hypoxaemia, fever, or hypotension. HFT enhanced gas exchange during BAL by preserving end-expiratory lung volume and reducing diaphragmatic workload [ 33 34 In a cohort of 40 patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy via the oral route for suspected pneumonia requiring bronchial aspirate collection, HFT at 40 L/min was associated with smaller decreases in SpO 2 11 More recent studies and meta-analyses have questioned the superiority of HFT over COT in improving oxygen saturation, minimising desaturation episodes, and preventing procedural interruptions [ 12 No significant effects on hypercapnia or the incidence of endotracheal intubation (ETI) have been observed. During flexible bronchoscopy with BAL, HFT appears more effective than COT in maintaining oxygen saturation in both ambulatory patients and hypoxaemic individuals in intensive care, without influencing ETI rates [ 35 36 37 In certain populations, including lung transplant recipients, or during procedures such as EBUS or foreign body removal, HFT also seems more effective than COT in preventing hypoxaemia. Ben-Menachem et al. [ 13 In summary, the advantages of HFT over COT are most evident in patients with significant baseline hypoxaemia, lung transplant recipients, and those at heightened risk of hypoxaemia during flexible bronchoscopy under deep sedation—such as individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), male sex, obesity, advanced age, or hypertension—particularly when BAL or EBUS is performed. In these patients, HFT improves oxygen saturation, reduces desaturation events, minimizes procedural interruptions, and lessens the need for supplementary airway interventions, without affecting hypercapnia or the incidence of ETI. 3.1.3. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure CPAP delivers a constant positive pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, promoting the recruitment of atelectatic lung regions, decreasing intrapulmonary shunting, and lowering the patient’s inspiratory effort. Its main limitation is the potential for poor tolerance of the interface and the requirement for specialised masks equipped with accessory ports to allow passage of the bronchoscope. The main effects of CPAP include enhanced oxygenation through the reduction in intrapulmonary shunting and ventilation–perfusion mismatch, alongside a decrease in the work of breathing. CPAP delivered via a face mask has been shown to effectively recruit alveoli and improve gas exchange in hypoxaemic patients. In those with heart failure, additional benefits have been described, including redistribution of pulmonary oedema, improved left ventricular performance, and reduced respiratory effort. The application of CPAP via a face mask during bronchoscopy has been assessed in patients with hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure (PaO 2 2 14 2 2 2 2 3.1.4. Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation NIV provides the benefits of CPAP while additionally delivering inspiratory pressure support, which diminishes the patient’s respiratory effort and maintains adequate ventilation during deeper levels of sedation. Its limitations, beyond discomfort associated with the interface, include challenges in achieving effective patient–ventilator synchrony due to leaks and interference from airway manipulation during the procedure. Extensive literature and clinical guidelines indicate that NIV preserves normal minute ventilation in patients with impaired respiratory drive, prevents peripheral airway collapse and atelectasis, promotes alveolar recruitment, enhances vital capacity and pulmonary compliance, and decreases the work of breathing. NIV thus allows bronchoscopy to be performed safely for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in patients experiencing acute exacerbations of respiratory failure, as well as in those with moderate to severe chronic respiratory insufficiency [ 38 39 40 NIV delivered via face mask was first applied during BAL in flexible bronchoscopy in 1996. In a cohort of immunocompromised patients with suspected pneumonia and severe hypoxaemia (PaO 2 2 15 2 2 41 42 To evaluate the feasibility and safety of NIV during bronchoscopy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for whom spontaneous ventilation is contraindicated, Da Conceisao et al. [ 16 2 2 2 More recently, in 2023, Sharma VK et al. [ 43 2 2 p p p Attempts have been made to identify predictive thresholds for complications during bronchoscopy performed with NIV. Reported predictors include PaO 2 2 p p p 2 2 17 Growing evidence supporting the use of HFT and NIV has prompted comparative studies in patients with mild to moderate hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure. Compared with HFT, NIV improved oxygenation before, during, and after bronchoscopy, and reduced the incidence of desaturation episodes below 90%, without affecting mortality or the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall, NIV and HFT exhibited comparable efficacy in preventing hypoxaemia during bronchoscopy. Nevertheless, NIV provided superior oxygenation adequacy and stability in patients with a baseline PaO 2 18 Regarding therapeutic procedures in which the FiO 2 2 2 44 Therefore, NIV appears to provide superior oxygenation adequacy and cardiopulmonary parameter stability compared to HFT and COT in patients with moderate to severe hypoxaemia and a history of cardiac disease, provided PaO 2 2 4. Discussion The respiratory support strategy should be individualised according to the patient’s type, risk factors, and the procedure to be performed. Some procedures (BAL, transbronchial biopsy, bronchial brushing, among others) can be carried out with extensive topical anaesthesia and superficial sedation. Others (EBUS, laser, etc.) may require deeper sedation, employing different pharmacological strategies including sedatives and analgesics. These drugs may alter the closing pressure of the upper airways, induce collapse, and affect both the respiratory pattern and ventilatory drive. Therefore, in cases of deep sedation, NIV may be necessary and preferable to other oxygenation strategies to ensure adequate ventilation and gas exchange. Risk factors for respiratory failure following FB are not yet fully established. However, large retrospective analyses have identified several factors associated with adverse events, including extensive pulmonary infiltrates, PaO 2 2 1 45 The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) have issued guidelines regarding the use of non-invasive respiratory support in hypoxaemic patients during the perioperative and periprocedural periods. For hypoxaemic patients undergoing bronchoscopy, they recommend employing non-invasive respiratory support rather than COT, with a level of evidence of 2B. However, the guidelines do not provide specific recommendations on the choice between HFT, NIV, or CPAP. HFT has been shown to be safe in most patients with mild to moderate ARF undergoing FB for diagnostic or therapeutic indications, including lung transplant recipients. In contrast, NIV provides more stable oxygenation during longer procedures or in patients with more severe ARF. Overall, HFT effectively enhances oxygenation in patients with lower oxygen demands, whereas NIV appears superior for those with severe ARF when compared with HFT. A recent multicentre study including 142 patients at high risk of desaturation—such as those with morbid obesity, a narrow trachea, or baseline hypoxaemia/hypercapnia—compared HFT with COT and found that HFT significantly reduced the incidence of desaturation, procedural interruptions, and the need for escalated interventions during bronchoscopy [ 46 Although the positive expiratory pressure generated by HFT diminishes substantially during oral breathing, potentially reducing its effects on alveolar distension and prevention of derecruitment, evidence indicates that HFT preserves oxygenation during BAL in FB by maintaining end-expiratory lung volume, preserving tidal volume, and reducing diaphragmatic effort compared with COT. Bronchoscopy can induce cardiovascular alterations that may trigger adverse events in patients with underlying cardiac vulnerability. In such cases, both CPAP and NIV are recommended over HFT or COT as the preferred respiratory support strategies for patients with coexisting cardiac disease and/or heart failure. CPAP may be favoured over NIV in certain situations because it delivers a continuous flow that is simpler to implement; whereas both techniques maintain positive airway pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, NIV requires careful adjustment of ventilator settings to optimise patient–ventilator synchrony during inspiration. Some interfaces for CPAP or NIV, including helmets and masks, have been specifically developed for use during FB, permitting bronchoscope insertion via the oral or nasal route. Nevertheless, air leaks around the interface or through the bronchoscope port may induce patient–ventilator asynchrony, which can be challenging to manage. The potential for microorganism dispersion should also be considered: when masks are well-fitted with minimal leaks, exhaled air disperses similarly to HFT, with reported distances of 172–332 mm. With helmet NIV, exhaled air escapes through the neck–helmet interface at 150–230 mm. By contrast, masks with intentional leaks via the exhalation port in single-limb circuits can produce exhaled air jets extending up to 916 mm [ 47 NIV has emerged as a safe and effective modality during FB in patients with chronic respiratory conditions, particularly those with COPD or baseline hypercapnia. Unlike COT, which may deliver an inadequate FiO 2 48 NIV not only ensures more effective maintenance of oxygenation during bronchoscopy but also mitigates CO 2 Randomised trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of COPD have shown that NIV is associated with lower rates of initial support failure and a reduced need for intubation compared with HFT (initial failure: 14% vs. 25%). Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis in hypercapnic COPD patients indicated that, while HFT and NIV demonstrated similar outcomes regarding mortality and intubation rates, the risk of treatment failure was significantly greater with HFT (RR 1.64; 95% CI: 1.04–2.60) [ 19 The application of NIV during bronchoscopy appears to be the optimal strategy in patients with severe hypoxaemia or hypercapnia, such as those with advanced COPD. In summary, current evidence indicates that NIV in patients with chronic respiratory disease provides superior protection against both hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, lowers the risk of post-procedural ventilatory failure, and improves procedural safety compared with HFT or COT. Currently, a multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial is in progress, enrolling 300 patients stratified according to the Horowitz index, to compare COT versus HFT, HFT versus NIV, and NIV versus invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) [ 49 Based on the current literature, a possible approach is outlined in Figure 2 Most studies have focused on the impact of oxygenation strategies on physiological parameters, with comparatively fewer addressing meaningful clinical outcomes. The quality of the reviewed literature is limited by small sample sizes and considerable heterogeneity among patient populations, precluding formal meta-analysis. Furthermore, most studies were conducted at single centres. Moreover, there is considerable variability in the titration and settings of HFT, NIV, and CPAP, alongside marked differences in sedation protocols. This review presents several limitations that warrant consideration. The literature search was confined to the PubMed and Cochrane databases, potentially omitting relevant studies indexed elsewhere. Given the limited number of rigorous trials directly comparing respiratory support strategies during flexible bronchoscopy, both randomised and high-quality observational studies were included. While this approach permitted a more comprehensive assessment of the available evidence, it may introduce a risk of bias. Furthermore, there remains a need for additional well-designed randomised controlled trials to facilitate direct comparisons among the various respiratory support modalities. A key strength of this review lies in its current and comprehensive appraisal of the available evidence regarding diverse respiratory support strategies during bronchoscopy, rather than limiting the focus to comparisons between high-flow therapy and conventional oxygen therapy, which dominate existing literature. We conducted a comparative analysis of the three principal oxygen delivery modalities employed during bronchoscopy, examining their characteristics and potential advantages. This direct comparison offers a practical framework for clinicians in selecting the most appropriate oxygenation strategy for diagnostic bronchoscopy, as summarised in the algorithm presented in Figure 2 5. Conclusions In conclusion, the selection of a respiratory support during flexible bronchoscopy should not be based on conventional oxygen therapy by default but must be guided by the type of procedure, the patient’s baseline status, and the anticipated risk of respiratory compromise. Consequently, the likelihood of respiratory deterioration during FB should be thoroughly assessed prior to the procedure [ 19 Figure 2 For patients with mild to moderate oxygen requirements and no significant haemodynamic compromise, HFT is recommended over COT as it provides more stable oxygenation, reduces the incidence of desaturation, and minimises procedural interruptions. In contrast, when bronchoscopy is undertaken in patients with more severe hypoxaemia, relevant cardiac comorbidities, or when deeper sedation is required, CPAP or NIV should be prioritised. Both modalities maintain positive airway pressure throughout the procedure, ensure adequate gas exchange, and contribute to greater cardiopulmonary stability. Among patients with chronic respiratory disease, particularly COPD or hypercapnia, NIV offers further advantages over HFT and COT. These include superior protection against carbon dioxide retention, a lower risk of post-procedural ventilatory failure, and a reduced need for endotracheal intubation while maintaining more stable cardiopulmonary parameters. NIV unloads the respiratory muscles and counteracts dynamic hyperinflation, thereby preventing intubation and reducing in-hospital mortality in this group of patients [ 50 51 Accordingly, the selection of respiratory support must be justified on clinical grounds: HFT is most appropriate for cases with mild to moderate oxygen demands, whereas CPAP or NIV should be reserved for patients with more severe respiratory or cardiac impairment or higher procedural risk.
