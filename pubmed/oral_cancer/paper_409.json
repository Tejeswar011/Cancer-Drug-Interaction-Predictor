The purpose of this study was to understand the role and mechanism of the lncRNA LBX2-AS1 in periodontitis. Methods Baseline clinical data were collected from 107 patients in the periodontitis group and 107 participants in the periodontally healthy control group (HC). Expression of LBX2-AS1 in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was assessed using qRT-PCR. To verify the binding relationships between miR-654-3p, LBX2-AS1 and TLR2, dual luciferase reporter gene and pull-down assays were performed. Periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) were stimulated with LPS to mimic periodontitis conditions. ELISA was used to measure TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β levels. ALP activity and RUNX2/OCN protein expression were detected to assess osteogenic differentiation. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were performed to analyze PDLCs proliferation and apoptosis. Results LBX2-AS1 and TLR2 were upregulated, while miR-654-3p was downregulated in periodontitis patients GCF. LBX2-AS1 could efficiently identify the onset of periodontitis. Downregulation of LBX2-AS1 inhibited inflammatory factor release, suppressed PDLCs proliferation, and differentiation, promoted apoptosis, and reversed LPS-induced damage to PDLCs. LBX2-AS1 negatively regulated miR-654-3p, and its downregulation counteracted the effects of LBX2-AS1 knockdown. As a target of miR-654-3p, TLR2 exacerbated LPS-induced inflammation and injury in PDLCs. miR-654-3p overexpression represses Myd88/NF-κB protein expression.

Early signs of the disease are often subtle and easily overlooked, but as it advances, it can lead to tooth mobility, weakened chewing ability, recurrent periodontal abscesses, and other symptoms, severely impacting human health [ 1 2 3–5 6 7 8 9 In recent years, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in various biological processes and diseases. lncRNAs, which are non-coding RNAs consisting of more than 200 nucleotides, do not directly encode proteins but play a pivotal role in regulating gene expression [ 10 11 12 13 Su et al. identified three novel and crucial lncRNAs associated with periodontitis—LINC00687, lncRNA Ladybird homeobox 2 antisense RNA 1 (LBX2-AS1), and LINC01566—using weighted gene co-expression network analysis [ 14 15 16 17 The objective of this study is to innovatively delve into the function of LBX2-AS1 in periodontitis, treating it as a pivotal focus of research. Our aim is to uncover its potential significance, and the regulatory mechanisms involved in periodontitis, with the hope of discovering novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for this condition. Methods Research object The participants in this study were selected from patients who sought medical attention at The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University between 2020 and 2022. Prior to the study’s commencement, ethical approval was granted by The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University (approval number:2019112) Ethics Committee, and all participants gave their written informed consent. The study protocols adhered strictly to the principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration. Inclusion criteria Periodontally healthy control group (HC): Individuals with healthy periodontal tissues ( n Clinically assessed periodontal tissues exhibiting a probing depth of ≤3mm, accompanied by the absence of gingival inflammation, characterized by pink gingival coloration, firm consistency, and absence of bleeding upon probing. Maintained oral hygiene indicated by a plaque index of ≤1 and negligible calculus accumulation. No recent (within the past 3 months) utilization of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, or other medications capable of influencing periodontal tissue status. Periodontitis patient group (Periodontitis): Patients diagnosed with periodontitis ( n Enrollment was limited to patients with periodontitis of at least Stage II severity, as defined by the 2018 classification system [ 18 Willing and able to comply with all study procedures and complete the required examinations and sample collections. No history of periodontal systemic interventions, such as periodontal flap surgery or guided tissue regeneration, within the last 3 months. Note on staging and grading: The cross-sectional design of this study and the lack of longitudinal data on disease progression precluded a precise determination of the disease stage (I–IV) and grade (A–C) for each individual according to the full 2018 classification criteria. Therefore, patients were included based on the presence of clear, objective signs of established periodontitis (as detailed above) that are indicative of at least Stage II severity Exclusion criteria  Presence of severe systemic diseases, encompassing uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c > 8%), hematological disorders, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. Current state of pregnancy or lactation. Mental health conditions or cognitive impairments that impede comprehension of the study or cooperation with study procedures. Recent (within the past three months) utilization of medications that have an impact on periodontal tissues or inflammation, such as immunosuppressants and anticoagulants. Presence of orthodontic appliances or inadequate dental restorations that induce gingival irritation. Incomplete or absent clinical data records. Sample size An initial assessment of the sample size was conducted using G*Power, with the following parameters: a medium effect size assumption (Cohen’s d 19 Examination of periodontal clinical indicators All patients with periodontitis underwent a comprehensive periodontal examination, excluding the 3rd molars. The test sites, including the lingual, buccal distal–medial, buccal medial, and buccal proximal–medial aspects of each tooth, were evaluated, with the average value of each site serving as the final result. The periodontal indicators assessed were as follows: Probing pocket depth: distance from gingival margin to periodontal pocket or gingival sulcus bottom. Clinical Attachment level: Measured as the distance from the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) to the bottom of the periodontal pocket. In cases of gingival recession, Clinical Attachment level equals probing pocket depth plus the distance from the gingival margin to the CEJ. In the absence of recession, Clinical Attachment level equals probing pocket depth minus the distance from the gingival margin to the CEJ. Bleeding index: 0 for healthy non - bleeding gingiva; 1 for inflamed non - bleeding on probing; 2 for pinpoint bleeding on probing; 3 for obvious bleeding; 4 for severe bleeding; 5 for spontaneous bleeding. Plaque index was assessed according to the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Index [ 20 Collection of samples Subjects underwent oral antisepsis, supragingival plaque removal with a sterile spatula, and scaling to eliminate calculus and soft tartar. The tooth surface was then dried by air-blowing to isolate it from moisture. Sterile periapical strips were positioned in the two deepest, non-adjacent periodontal pockets for optimal gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) contact. If contamination was confirmed, the strips were discarded and re-sampled. After 30 s, the strips were placed in phosphate buffer (pH 7) for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C and 12,000× g Cell culture and cell transfection Human PDLCs (Fuyu Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were sub-cultured that were cultivated within DMEM medium in a mixture containing 1% penicillin–streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. After wall attachment, the cells were digested and reintroduced to the above environment for passaging culture. The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 LPS induction and osteogenic differentiation induction Cells from both the transfection and control groups, which were in the logarithmic growth phase, were chosen. After digestion and cell counting, they were inoculated into 24-well plates. Subsequently, 1.0 μg/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to these plates to treat the cells for 24 h, thereby establishing an in vitro 9 Apoptosis assay PDLCs in different treatment groups, including the blank control group (Ctrl; untreated), LPS-only treated group (without transfection), and the LPS-treated groups that had been transfected with various vectors, were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1× binding buffer. The cells were then double-stained with 5 μL of both FITC-Annexin V and PI using the Membrane Associated Protein V-Fluorescein Isothiocyanate/Propidium Iodide (AnnexinV-FITC/PI) kit (Beyotime Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), while ensuring the process occurred in a dark environment for 5 min. Apoptosis analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) with CellQuest software. The percentages of cells in different phases were quantified as follows: viable cells (Annexin V – – + – + + – + Cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation verified by CCK8 assay. PDLCs subjected to various treatments were seeded in 96-well plates. At predetermined time points, media were aspirated from wells, and CCK-8 reagent (Takara, Japan) was added. After a gentle shaking for mixing, plates were incubated in an incubator for 2 h to allow for adequate cell-CCK-8 reaction. A microplate reader measured the OD 450 Enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) experiment The levels of inflammation-associated cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), mature IL-1β were measured using ELISA kits (Abcam, UK). The process began with resuspending cells in the lysis buffer provided in the kit, followed by centrifugation to isolate the supernatant as the sample for testing. Preparation of both samples and standards adhered strictly to the instructions outlined in the ELISA kit. Finally, the OD 450 Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay ALP is a key early-stage marker of osteogenic differentiation. ALP activity was measured using a commercial ALP assay kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol and established methodologies [ 21 680 Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) The Trizol method was used to extract total RNA from GCF samples and PDLCs, which was then evaluated for quality using an ultra-micro spectrophotometer. The RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA template using a reverse transcriptase kit (Vazyme Biotechnology Co., LTD., Nanjing, China). cDNA was amplified using an RT-qPCR kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China), which was performed in a thermal cycle of initial denaturation at 95 °C (1 min), denaturation at 95 °C (20 s) and 60 °C (1 min) for annealing by 40 cycles. After completion, LBX2-AS1, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA (normalized to GAPDH) and miR-654-3p (normalized to U6) relative expression levels were quantified by means of the 2 –ΔΔCt Western blotting assay The expression levels of TLR2, Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88), phosphorylated NF-κB p65 (p-NF-κB p65) proteins, and osteogenic differentiation markers including OCN, Runx2, NLRP3, and cleaved caspase-1 p20 proteins were examined in PDLCs from various treatment groups. The lysate was mixed with the PDLCs suspension and allowed to lyse for 30 min on ice. Following this, the mixture was centrifuged using an ultra-high-speed centrifuge (14,000 g Dual-luciferase reporter assay The interaction sites of miR-654-3p with both LBX2-AS1 and TLR2 were identified via https://gong_lab.hzau.edu.cn/lncrnasnp3#!/ http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/ Pull-down assay A pull-down assay was conducted using biotin-labeled miR-654-3p probe (Bio-miR-654-3p) and a negative control probe (Bio-NC), both supplied by Ribobio. The assay was performed following the protocol outlined in the Pierce ™ Statistical analysis Experimental data were obtained from three or more independent experimental replicates. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5 and SPSS 23.0 software. Measurement results were presented as mean ± standard deviation and count data were presented as numbers and analyzed using the chi-squared test. For comparing data between two sample groups, a t P Results Expression of LBX2-AS1 in gingival sulcus fluid of patients with periodontitis and its correlation with clinical features Clinical data was gathered for both HC and periodontitis patients.

Impact of LBX2-AS1 on LPS-stimulated PDLCs injury LPS exposure upregulated LBX2-AS1 expression in PDLCs, while transfection with an si-LBX2-AS1 vector effectively downregulated its expression ( Figure 2a Figure 2b Figure 2c Figure 2d Figure 2e Figure 2f + - + + Figure 2.

Western blot analysis revealed that LPS treatment significantly upregulated the protein expression of the core inflammasome sensor NLRP3 ( Figure S1a Figure S1b Figure S1c Discussion GCF, derived from periodontal tissue, is easy to collect and more accurate for reflecting periodontal diseases than serum samples. It has a stable composition, high specificity and sensitivity, and is widely used in collecting periodontitis diagnostic markers, unlike complex and easily interfered salivary samples [ 22 23 24 25 Previous studies have extensively demonstrated the critical role of LPS in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. It is capable of triggering an inflammatory response and influencing the activity of PDLCs, accelerating periodontal tissue destruction [ 26 27 28 in vitro The potential role of LBX2-AS1 in periodontitis was revealed in a related report by Su et al. [ 14 29 30 31 In our study, miR-654-3p, a downstream miRNA of LBX2-AS1, was of particular interest. Hao et al. identified miR-654-3p through microarray analysis and found its close association with the osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells [ 32 33 34 35 Further research has revealed that TLR2, which is directly targeted by miR-654-3p, worsened the LPS-triggered inflammation and cell damage when overexpressed, counteracting the impact of miR-654-3p. The significance of TLR2 in innate immunity and inflammation is widely acknowledged [ 36 37 38 39 via 40 41 42 TLR2 is a well-recognized upstream regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Upon activation by PAMPs (e.g. LPS) or DAMPs, TLR2 triggers signaling cascades (e.g. NF-κB) to upregulate the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β, providing the ‘priming signal’ for inflammasome activation[ 43 44 However, this study has several limitations. Firstly, the interactions between this axis and other related signaling pathways remain unexplored, which restricts our understanding of the disease mechanism. Secondly, our measurement of TLR2 was confined to GCF and in vitro via via via In conclusion, our study suggests that LBX2-AS1 present in GCF may emerge as a novel diagnostic biomarker for periodontitis. It also appears to mediate LPS-induced inflammatory responses and cellular damage in PDLCs by regulating the miR-654-3p/TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway ( Figure 8 Figure 8.
