But, few studies have examined the odor markers for various toxic effects in the mammalian system. This study attempted to identify the novel diagnostic odor biomarkers for chemical-induced hepatotoxicity in animals. The changes in the concentration of odors were analyzed in the urine of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats treated with two dosages (100 or 200 mg/kg) of 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The TCP treatment induced significant toxicity, including a decrease in body weight, an increase in serum biochemical factors, and histopathological changes in the liver of SD rats. During this hepatotoxicity, the concentrations of six odors (ethyl alcohol, acrolein (2-propenal), methanesulfonyl chloride, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclotrisiloxane, and 2-heptanone) in urine changed significantly after the TCP treatment. Among them, acrolein, an acrid and pungent compound, showed the highest rate of increase in the TCP-treated group compared to the Vehicle-treated group. In addition, this increase in acrolein was accompanied by enhanced spermine oxidase (SMOX) expression, an acrolein metabolic enzyme, and the increased level of IL-6 transcription as a regulator factor that induces SMOX production. The correlation between acrolein and other parameters was conformed using correlagram analyses. These results provide scientific evidence that acrolein have potential as a novel diagnostic odor biomarker for TCP-induced hepatotoxicity.
