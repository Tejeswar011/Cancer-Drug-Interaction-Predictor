MSCs from the umbilical cord (UC) can be collected easily, non-invasively, and painlessly and do not involve ethical problems. The derived cell products harbor great potential in stem cell technology and agricultural applications. A tissue grinder (TIGR) was used to homogenize porcine UC tissue and to dissociate the UC cells, thereby testing different tissue-to-medium ratios. Cells were cultivated until passage 3, and the proliferation rate, metabolic activity, colony forming ability, surface marker expression, and multi-lineage differentiation potential were assessed. Tissue grinding could be successfully used to isolate UC-derived porcine cells with a high yield and viability, as well as an increasing proliferation rate during cultivation. Isolated cells showed MSC-like features: the expression of CD73, CD90, and CD105, ability to form colonies, and adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation. Tissue grinding is highly suitable for isolating high-quality cells from whole UC tissue of pigs in a fast and reproducible way. Cells might be used in a wide range of therapeutical and biotechnological applications, such as understanding and treating severe disorders, drug screening, or tissue engineering. Cells from supposedly waste tissues like UC will be especially useful in transplantation medicine. tissue grinding umbilical cord MSC multipotency German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space 031B1259A The project which generated this publication was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space under funding code 031B1259A.

Introduction Cell cultures are important tools for investigating cell and tissue behavior and function in vitro and are also utilized for the production of biologicals such as antibodies or vaccines. Although permanent, indefinitely proliferating cell lines like Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human embryonic kidney (HEK), Jurkat, or C2C12 have been established for those purposes, working with primary cells is inevitable and very common for other applications [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Because of these limitations, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from several adult and perinatal tissues have aroused greater interest. MSCs are multipotent, show a spindle-shaped morphology, and have the ability to self-renew [ 6 8 9 10 4 5 6 7 11 12 13 14 15 16 Although MSCs reside in and can be isolated from various tissues, the most commonly used sources are bone marrow, followed by adipose tissue and umbilical cord (UC) [ 17 18 19 SOX 2 OCT 4, 20 21 22 23 24 25 6 7 21 The MSC containing connective tissue of the UC develops by the fusion of the body stalk and the amnion mesoderm. This specialized, mucous connective tissue, the so-called Wharton’s Jelly (WJ), is mainly composed of proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, collagen, and elastic and reticular fibers, and covered by a monolayer epithelium of ectodermal origin [ 7 26 DPT Col15A1 CLDN11 TIMP3 19 27 28 26 29 30 31 7 21 22 32 33 34 35 36 37 28 29 Here, we use porcine material, which offers many benefits regarding tissue sampling and applications. Compared to other animals such as mouse or rat, pig organ physiology shows more similarity to that of humans, making it a better experimental model for testing biomedical applications and evaluating the choice of cells for their development [ 38 37 22 39 40 41 37 The isolation method has a high impact on the cell yield and quality (e.g., viability, and ability to proliferate and differentiate) of primary cells like UC-MSC and, thus, determines the reliability of the results [ 26 1 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 7 35 27 45 46 44 21 27 In order to optimize, standardize, and shorten the cell-sourcing procedure, specifically if larger quantities need to be processed, (semi-)automated devices might be very useful [ 1 49 50 44 50 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Pig Serum Production Whole-blood samples from male and female slaughter pigs from German Landrace (body weight 25–81.5 kg, age 81–138 days) were received from the experimental abattoir of the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN), approved by the E.U. and the German quality management system QS. Slaughtering was performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Care Committee of the State Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, based on the German Law of Animal Protection. Serum was obtained by centrifugation of coagulated whole-blood samples and sterilized by sterile filtration through a 0.2 µm filter (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and subsequent UV treatment. Before use, the serum from 18 animals was pooled to minimize variability due to animal-specific differences. 2.2. Isolation and Cultivation of Umbilical Cord Cells (UCCs) Umbilical cords (UCs) from newborn German Landrace piglets were collected when delivered from the experimental pig unit of the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN). No animal experiment was conducted, since there was no intervention in the process of birth itself (no ethical approval needed). In total, 24 umbilical cords from female and male piglets were used within approximately 1–3 h after sampling for the shown experiments. UC were washed in 0.9% NaCl solution containing 100 U/mL Penicillin, 100 µg/mL Streptomycin, and 2.5 µg/mL Amphotericin B (all from PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). In a sterile petri dish, 2 cm long pieces of UC were cut longitudinally to remove blood vessels as described in [ 22 2 44 Figure 1 2 2 2 2 2.3. Surface Marker Analysis Directly after the first harvest (day 19), cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and 2 mM EDTA. Subsequently, antibodies against CD105 (PE-conjugated, clone MEM-229, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), CD90 (FITC-conjugated, clone 5E10, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany), and CD73 (unconjugated, clone 1F22, Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) were added and incubated for 1 h. Isotype controls for CD105 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and CD90 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) were incubated in a separate sample; secondary antibody only was used as a staining control for CD73. After washing with PBS, the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (Alexa Fluor 647, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) was incubated with the cells for 1 h. After washing again with PBS, cells were separated via a 50 µm cell strainer (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) and analyzed (10,000 events per sample) by using an argon-equipped Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) and evaluated with Kaluza software version 2.1.2.20011 (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). 2.4. CFU Assay For colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, cells in passage 1 and 3 were seeded in growth medium at a density of 200 cells/well in a 6-well plate (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Medium was changed twice a week. After 14 days, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted manually. 2.5. Metabolic Activity (WST1) To assess the metabolic activity of isolated cells, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1600 cells/well) in passage 1 and 3 using growth medium. After 3 and 7 days of cultivation, the supernatant was used to perform WST-1 assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). In addition, cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet before bound dye was solubilized again with methanol to measure absorbance at 570 nm. 2.6. Multi-Lineage Differentiation Assay For adipogenic differentiation, 0.1 × 10 5 For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were used for micromass culture in passage 3. Therefore, 2.4 × 10 5 2 For osteogenic differentiation, 0.5 × 10 5 37 2.7. Statistical Analyses For statistical analysis, SigmaPlot 13.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) was used. Data are shown as mean ± SD. If Normality Test (Shapiro–Wilk) and Equal Variance Test (Brown–Forsythe) were passed, One-Way Analysis of Variance was performed. Otherwise, Kruskal–Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks was performed. Box-and-whisker plots are presented with the maximum 1.5 of the interquartile range (Q1–Q3). Outliers were excluded from statistical analyses and statistical significances were assigned as follows: *** p p p p 3. Results 3.1. Isolation of UC Cells Comparing Different Tissue-Grinding Methods The TIGR system was used for tissue grinding in order to isolate MSC-like cells from porcine umbilical cords. The ratio of tissue to medium varied between variants (0.75:1, 1:1, and 1.5:1; Figure 1 Figure 1 5 5 5 3.2. Cultivation and Proliferation of UC Cells Isolated UC cells were seeded on cell culture dishes and cultivated until passage 3 to further observe the cellular properties. The viability of the cells was very good throughout all the tested passages (overall mean 91.1% ± 8.9) and no statistical differences were observed ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Before the first dissociation, cells were small and the morphology changed from round/spherical, to polygonal and spindle-shaped ( Figure 2 Cellular growth was monitored during cultivation. Firstly, the proliferation rate was calculated from the number of cells which were seeded with equal cell density and harvested during passaging ( Figure 3 Secondly, cells were seeded with similar densities in passage 1 and 3, and cellular components were stained with crystal violet after 3 or 7 days of incubation ( Figure 3 3.3. Metabolic Activity and Ability to Form Colonies The WST1 assay can easily be used to monitor the metabolic activity of cells since only dividing cells can reduce the tetrazolium salt ( Figure 4 The ability of the isolated UC cells to form colonies after seeding them in a low density was tested in a next step with a classical CFU assay ( Figure 4 3.4. Surface Marker Expression and Tri-Lineage Differentiation of UC Cells In Vitro The expression of the traditional MSC markers CD73, CD105, and CD90 was tested via flow cytometry when cells were harvested after finishing passage 0 after 19 days in culture [ 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 4. Discussion Choosing the best method with which to isolate primary cells from tissue is of the utmost importance in order to optimally use the cell source while obtaining the desired cell type in very good quality. On the one hand, enzymatic digestion methods are expensive and might favor specific cells depending on the selected enzyme or enzyme cocktail and the subsequent purification method. On the other hand, with explant cultures, the outgrowth of cells needs a longer time, especially for slow-growing cells, and require a substantial amount of individual handling of the samples, which hampers standardization. Moreover, the frequent floating of the tissue fragments in the medium can diminish the cell yield, since the cells cannot migrate to the plastic surface while floating [ 7 44 The viability of cells was acceptable directly after isolation, even though considerably lower compared to later passages. We did not test if the shear forces during grinding lead to apoptosis, but, in previous studies, this was not the case for the TIGR device [ 44 Cell isolation with tissue grinding is performed without any preference for a specific cell type or cell characteristic [ 44 28 36 22 Figure 2 7 22 34 Colony formation is a characteristic of MSCs [ 51 52 52 19 19 51 53 54 55 However, isolation and culture conditions might also play a role. For example, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is important for self-renewal and cell survival, e.g., by restoring telomerase activity [ 56 20 The surface antigens CD73, CD90, and CD105 are claimed as typical MSC markers [ 57 For the interpretation of our results, various factors, for example, species differences, the composition of the isolated cell population, and changes induced due to the in vitro culture conditions (notably the medium composition) and time (passage used), have to be mentioned [ 7 58 59 29 29 60 61 32 36 36 The spatial and temporal stability of the marker expression in UC-derived cells in different species is still under consideration and differs depending on the experimental setup [ 7 62 63 64 62 32 7 7 Using a few cell surface molecules is not sufficient to fully characterize the functional potency of UCCs [ 5 7 7 Besides testing for the cellular properties of pUCCs isolated with the TIGR device in general, we also aimed at comparing three variants differing in the tissue-to-medium ratio. All three variants tested in this study could be successfully used to isolate viable, proliferative UCCs. In a variety of cellular parameters, all variants gave rise to comparable results (the viability, cell size, morphology, MSC marker expression, and three-lineage differentiation). Nevertheless, differences relevant for the experimental setup were observed. The dramatically lower cell yield in variant 1.5:1 is surely the most prominent one. Furthermore, cells obtained with this variant were not able to increase their cell proliferation rate during cell cultivation. Both other variants significantly increased the cellular growth in later passages. In WJ-derived pUCCs, the proliferation rate slowed down in higher passages (P4–P11) [ 36 5. Conclusions In summary, tissue grinding is highly suitable for isolating high-quality cells from whole UC tissue, which show MSC-like features. For a further characterization of the possible MSC phenotype of pUCCs, additional experiments (e.g., defining pUCC subpopulations and specific surface markers, growth factor assays, and hematopoietic and endothelial marker expression) will be necessary in the future. Tissue grinding provides a scalable, fast, and reproducible way to isolate UCCs with a high yield. The cells might be used in a wide range of therapeutical and biotechnological applications, such as understanding and treating severe disorders, screening for new drugs and toxins, or tissue engineering to create surrogate tissues and organs [ 7 65 66 16 66 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Kerstin Niemann and Angela Steinborn for their technical assistance; the staff of the animal facility; and the service group cytometry of the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN).
