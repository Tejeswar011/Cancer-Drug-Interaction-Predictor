Introduction and aims The study aimed to explore nongovernmental organizations’ (NGOs’) roles in promoting oral health for different targeted beneficiaries, and to study NGO’s evaluation methods to assess the impact and performance of their projects. Methods This study was a scoping review with thematic analysis. A literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Publications reporting on NGO-related oral health promotions and activities were included in this review. A thematic framework was used to synthesize the literature according to NGOs’ roles, targeted beneficiaries, and evaluation measures. Results A total of 1363 references were identified by literature search, and 23 articles were included in this review. It was found that NGOs served various targeted beneficiaries, especially disadvantaged groups, such as children, homeless people, and older adults in developing countries and lower-income societies. NGOs functioned in various roles, ‘professional doctors’, ‘service providers’, ‘public educators’, ‘proactive volunteers’, ‘industry trainers’, ‘active advocates’, ‘field researchers’, and ‘potential funder’, to provide both direct and indirect services. Project evaluations were conducted regarding programme-oriented, beneficiary-oriented, and organization-oriented evaluations with a mixed-method design. Conclusion NGOs play an active role in promoting and improving people’s oral health and well-being by providing various services and activities. The multifaceted involvement of NGOs highlights their importance in improving oral health outcomes and addressing oral health disparities in broad community settings. Clinical relevance This review shows a landscape view of the various roles of NGOs in oral health promotion. It is expected to strengthen the power of NGOs to implement a wide range of activities by collaborating across sectors and engaging various stakeholders. This integrated approach will foster a holistic and impactful strategy for promoting oral health, ultimately leading to improved oral health outcomes and overall well-being.

(2) How have these roles and services been evaluated? Searching strategy A literature search was conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, MEDLINE, and Embase from January 2000 to March 2023. Articles reporting on NGOs’ activities in oral health promotion were included in this review. NGOs, and oral health/dental health/oral care/dental care were selected as the searching keywords. Table 1 Table 1 Search strategies used in the literature search. Table 1 Database Search strategy Scopus All (NGO OR nongovernment organization) AND All (oral health OR dental health OR oral care OR dental care OR dental health services OR Web of Science ALL = (“NGO” OR “nongovernment organization”) AND ALL = (\"oral health\" OR ScienceDirect All (“NGO” OR “nongovernment organization”) AND All (\"oral health\" OR \"dental health\" OR \"oral care\" OR “dental care” OR “dental health services” OR “dental services” OR “community dentistry”) Embase/Ovid ((NGO or \"nongovernment organization\") and (\"oral health\" or \"dental health\" or \"oral care\" or \"dental care\" or \"dental health services\" or \"dental services\" or \"community dentistry\")).mp. PubMed/MEDLINE (“NGO” OR “nongovernment organization”) AND (\"oral health\" OR \"dental health\" OR \"oral care\" OR “dental care” OR “dental health services” OR “dental services” OR “community dentistry”) Eligibility criteria Peer-reviewed articles were included if they (1) explicitly reported the roles, services, or strategies of NGOs in promoting oral health among populations; and/or (2) described or evaluated the implementation and outcomes of NGOs’ oral health programmes, including both internal and external evaluations. The exclusion criteria were set as following. Articles were excluded if they (1) were not written in English; (2) were not relevant to the research questions (ie, not focused on NGOs or oral health promotion); (3) did not identify NGOs as a key role in programme delivery, design, or evaluation; and (4) were other nonpeer-reviewed documents such as working papers and unpublished reports. Screening and data selection References identified from the databases were uploaded to a standard production platform, Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia), for further analysis. Duplicates were identified and removed. Two reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of the identified references independently. Full-text reading of the potentially eligible articles was carried out independently by the same two reviewers. Any doubts on the inclusion of a paper were discussed and agreed upon by both reviewers. A cross-reference check of these documents among the authors was further conducted to identify additional relevant materials. Data extraction and analysis The following data was extracted from the included articles: author, year, study location, study design, NGOs and project names (if any), targeted beneficiaries, specific services provided, and NGOs’ evaluation. In addition, detailed information was extracted regarding the evaluation of NGO-led oral health promotion efforts, including (1) whether any form of evaluation was conducted, (2) evaluation content, (3) evaluation framework and tools, and (4) evaluation results. The extracted textual data were analysed thematically using Braun and Clarke’s 14 The analysis was grounded in the explicit content reported in the primary studies. No interpretations were introduced beyond the original texts; an interpretive synthesis of study descriptions was conducted. For example, when several studies described NGOs delivering direct clinical services, we inductively grouped these under the theme of ‘service providers’. This process allowed us to develop a structured typology of NGO roles that reflected recurring patterns across the literature while remaining faithful to the data. All coding decisions and theme definitions were documented in shared files to support transparency, reflexivity, and reproducibility. As the present study followed a scoping review methodology, no formal critical appraisal of individual sources was conducted, in accordance with the aim of mapping existing evidence rather than assessing study quality.

These categories emerged from recurring patterns in how NGOs’ activities were described across the literature. Direct services NGOs provided direct services to targeted beneficiaries, such as clinical dental screening and treatments (eg, tooth extractions for pain relief, placement of restorations, scaling, and treatment of cleft palate), clinical dental health care, oral health education and promotion, and integrated interventions with other social service programmes. 16 17 18 19 20 16 , 21 22 23 7 , 22 , 24 Professional doctors NGOs directly recruited professional dentists to provide curative treatments and preventive care, leveraging their commitment as ‘professional doctors’. Around 40 NGOs in Hong Kong, such as Loving Smiles Special Care Dental Centre and Haven of Hope S K Yee Hang Hau Clinic, provided dental services in elderly centres and nursing homes, especially serving people in lower socioeconomic or disadvantaged groups. These NGOs set up outreach dental teams, purchased equipment and consumables, and arranged transportation of the dental equipment to the service site. 19 18 Service providers As ‘service providers’, NGOs tended to provide integrated services including oral health care combined with other social services, to disadvantaged populations, especially in some nonprofit clinics and social service agencies. The nonprofit dental clinics in British Columbia, Canada provided oral health care to homeless and low-income people by integrating dental care services with community social services, such as mental health care, substance use programmes, shelter and housing services, social exclusion, and trauma treatment for patients with an urgent and wide range of needs. 20 25 Public educators NGOs empowered local communities and promoted oral health and well-being as ‘public educators’, especially in some global dental programmes and international NGOs, such as the FDI World Dental Federation. 21 , 22 16 23 Proactive volunteers NGOs functioned as ‘proactive volunteers’ by actively recruiting and organizing volunteer activities. The American Dental Association had a well-developed international volunteer website with information on these projects and a list of sponsoring organizations. 24 7 22 26 Indirect services NGOs were also crucial in providing indirect services that benefited targeted populations by empowering dental workforces and facilitating development of dentistry. They fulfilled various roles such as ‘industrial trainers’, 27 , 28 7 , 29 30 31 32 24 , 33 , 34 Industrial trainers As ‘industrial trainers’, many NGOs offered training programmes and workshops for dentists. These initiatives aimed to enhance dentists’ skills and knowledge, ensuring the delivery of high-quality dental care services. The Global Child Dental Fund launched the Senior Dental Leaders programme, which adopted the principles of collaborative leadership as the cornerstone in establishing a dental leadership network to combat poor child oral health worldwide. 27 28 26 Active advocates NGOs functioned as ‘active advocates’, especially the professional federations and associations, raising awareness about dental health and advocating for local, regional, and national policies and programmes that promoted oral health. In Malaysia, the Malaysia Dental Association and Malaysia Private Dental Practitioner Association, as NGOs, were the key stakeholders and shared views on the drivers for change for the Malaysian dental workforce and their potential implications. Drivers for the workforce were identified across four main domains: policy-politics, trends in demography, social and economic, and technology-scientific development. In this way, the key dental workforce in Malaysia was identified and advocated higher awareness of the significance of oral health. 29 Field researcher NGOs were also engaged in research activities. Their projects served as a research field for conducting studies and gathering data to understand oral health challenges, so as to develop evidence-based solutions. 8 , 30 32 31 Potential funders As ‘potential funders’, NGOs like the American Dental Association (ADA) contributed significantly by providing financial support for various dental projects. The ADA had developed an extensive international volunteer website that served as a valuable resource, offering information on these projects and a list of sponsoring organizations. 24 33 , 34 Theme 3: Evaluation on NGO projects Evaluations on oral health services and programmes were summarized, ie, evaluator, relevant theme, evaluation content, framework, and tools, and results ( Table 3 Table 3 Evaluation of NGO oral health services/programmes ( n Table 3 Study Evaluators Relevant themes Evaluation content Evaluation framework and tools Evaluation results Arefi et al 22 Researchers Project-oriented Sustainability of dental outreach programmes/initiatives in developing nations The theory of change framework: Scope: Short-term trips that offer direct clinical care instead of local training, prevention, and lack population coverage. Benzian and Gelbier 36 FDI Organization-oriented Diversity, activities, and limitation of the Dental Aid Organizations Dental NGOs originating in developed countries: Quality assurance measures were standards for staff and goal setting. Monitoring and evaluation seldom applied Quality assurance was not a major activity. Bourgeois et al 21 FDI, Unilever plc, and National Dental Associations Project-oriented Programme evaluation on the effectiveness of phase 2 of ‘ Live.Learn.Laugh Drawing on the behavioural theory, the LLL phase 2 programme provided technical assistance and guidance in designing, implementing, and evaluating demonstration projects on evidence at the community level throughout the six WHO regions There was insufficient evidence for the efficacy of primary school-based behavioural interventions in reducing caries, plaque outcomes and children’s oral health knowledge acquisition. Dugdill and Pine 35 Researchers Project-oriented Programme evaluation on the effectiveness of ‘ Live.Learn.Laugh An in-depth sample analysis of Country Projects ( n In those examined by site visits, clear evidence was found of capacity building to deliver oral health. Jones et al 18 Researchers Beneficiary-oriented Utilization and unmet need for oral health care, and satisfaction among health centre patients Using the 2009 Health Center Patient Survey and performed multivariate logistic regressions to examine factors associated with access to dental care at health centres, unmet need, and patient experience Uninsured patients and those whose insurance does not provide dental coverage experienced restricted access and greater unmet need. Kohli et al 28 Researchers Beneficiary-oriented Knowledge and attitudes of caregivers towards dental care for older adults in long-term care facilities Caregivers’ Attitudes Study, a cross-sectional study that took place and consisted of surveys measuring the attitudes of caregivers in ACF’s in Clackamas County, Oregon The majority of caregivers felt comfortable with regard to their oral health background and daily activities. Rodriguez et al 23 Researchers Beneficiary-oriented Programme evaluation on a pedagogical workshop programme with and for homeless young people Use critical consciousness as an educative tool, and an action research design to codesign, implement, and evaluate a series of oral health and health pedagogical workshops This pedagogical workshop fostered trust building and collective engagement, constructed knowledge, and developed skills. Sardana et al 31 Researchers Project-oriented Programme evaluation on specially designed methods to educate and motivate visually impaired children 148 visually impaired children who were residents of two institutes for the visually impaired Tactile and auditory measures were found to be effective in educating and motivating visually impaired children regarding maintenance of oral hygiene. Spero and Rozas 25 Researchers Organization-oriented Jevaia Oral Health Care and its oral health services Structural social work (SSW) concepts (a critical theory that frames poverty, violence, and disease as the product of oppressive social structures) were applied to a rural dental project in Nepal Jevaia Oral Health Care operationalized SSW principles of tension relief, consciousness-raising, collectivization, and power-brokering, but was limited in tackling structural problems around etiological aspects of oral disease. van Midde et al 8 Researchers Beneficiary-oriented Accessibility of a voluntary dentist network providing dental treatments to undocumented migrants Using a framework analysis method, this qualitative study used semistructured interviews ( n n n n Through the implementation of a voluntary dentist network, treatments could be provided to undocumented migrants as a temporary solution. Weening-Verbree et al 33 Researchers Project-oriented Impact of an Oral Care Program (OCP) on home care nurses’ attitudes and knowledge about oral health (care) A pre–post study, without a control group, was conducted. Implementation was measured with questionnaires at baseline and after 6 mo for home care nurses The oral health of older people improved significantly after 3 mo, and the OCP was most beneficial for people with full dentures. Weening-Verbree et al 34 Researchers Project-oriented; beneficiary-oriented Experiences of the stakeholders involved and to report the experienced impact of an Oral Care Program (OCP) Three dental hygienists, nine home care nurses, and eight older people were interviewed with semistructured interviews, which were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis OCP was experienced as mostly positive by all stakeholders involved. Majority of the evaluations were conducted by researchers, but ambiguous information was found on the role and nature of the researcher/reporter. It was unclear whether the ‘researcher’ was from the NGO, a collaborator with NGO, or worked as an independent party. Regarding evaluation content, three main types were illustrated: project-oriented, beneficiary-oriented, and organization-oriented evaluations. Project-oriented evaluations assessed the sustainability of dental outreach programmes/initiatives in developing nations, 22 21 , 35 33 , 34 18 , 28 25 , 36 In terms of evaluation tools, it was found that the diversity of evaluation theories and techniques, such as the Theory of Change Framework, 22 25 23 35 36 23 , 31 , 33 , 34 As for the evaluation results, evidence indicated that NGOs’ services and programmes in promoting oral health yielded positive outcomes, such as the satisfaction of access to oral health care among patients, 18 28 23 31 22 21 35 , 36 Discussion The present review summarized NGOs’ various roles in promoting oral health and critically looked into NGOs’ service evaluation ( Figure 2 9 37 38 , 39 Fig. 2 NGOs’ roles, service, and evaluation in oral health promotion. Fig 2 The nature of NGOs is different in terms of regions and types, which leads to different targeted beneficiaries and roles of NGOs. Complementary to previous research, 21 , 35 , 36 40 41 , 42 NGOs’ oral health services are also facing the challenges of localization and generalization in different contexts. In other words, how do NGOs adapt to the local contexts? This study reviews a strategy to integrate oral health into public health and to make it more accessible and responsive. There are different types of localization, such as multiobjective public health programmes (oral health is one component), indirectly delivered oral care services via trainers, and dental treatment provided in addition to health promotion. 35 21 43 8 , 22 Systematic and scientific evaluation should be an integral component of an oral health programme to monitor the effectiveness of NGOs’ contribution in oral health promotion. However, this review found that 12 out of 23 studies did not report any evaluation on programme/projects. Further, many of the existing evaluations were limited in scope, relying primarily on biomedical paradigms and quantitative methods rooted in clinical research. 44 45 , 46 22 Despite the valuable insights gained from this scoping review, several limitations should be acknowledged: first, this review was limited to peer-reviewed literature, excluding grey literature such as NGO reports, policy briefs, and unpublished documents. Our intention is to focus on peer-reviewed literature to maintain methodological consistency and data quality. However, this may lead to possible omission of information on real-world NGO programmes that are active in practice but undocumented in academic journals. Future studies should consider to incorporates broader information sources, such as grey literature, organizational case studies, and programme reports, to better capture the breadth of NGO involvement in oral health promotions. Second, the reliance on published studies introduces the risk of publication bias, where successful or well-documented projects are more likely to be reported, while less successful or smaller-scale NGO activities may remain undocumented. This may skew the representation of NGO roles and impact in oral health promotion. Exploring only peer-reviewed databases may capture just the ‘tip of the iceberg’ in understanding the full extent of NGOs’ contributions to oral health. Many impactful NGO activities, especially those in remote or resource-constrained areas, may not be formally studied or published, limiting the ability to capture the true breadth of their work. The findings of this review provide current knowledge in both research and clinical contexts, warranting future research. First, it is crucial to explore the dynamics of cross-sector collaboration among key stakeholders involved in promoting oral health, including NGOs, government offices, communities, corporate companies, and higher education institutions. Both global and local organizations are suggested to explore good practices and stakeholder collaboration. Secondly, practical barriers NGOs faced and their coping strategies should be further researched. These current barriers include structural challenges, such as top-down approaches limited to technical thinking in specific contexts. Additionally, financial constraints, honest evaluation, shortage of human resources, and organizational change pose significant challenges for all organizations. How dental NGOs use different strategies to tackle the barriers is of both theoretical and practical significance. Thirdly, special types of NGOs, such as global dental aid organizations, require further research to understand their diversity, activities, and limitations. The influence of sociocultural and contextual factors should be taken into consideration. Lastly, more investigation is warranted regarding the evidence-based evaluation of NGOs and their tendency to demonstrate accountability in their services and adapt to multiple roles. Understanding the extent to which NGOs integrate evidence-based practices and evaluating the impact of their interventions can provide valuable insights for improving their effectiveness. To support these efforts, future research should incorporate broader sources to better capture the breadth of NGO involvement in oral health promotion. Oral health is recognized as a fundamental human right, yet stark disparities in access to oral healthcare persist, particularly among marginalized and underserved populations. Our findings showed that NGOs play a vital role in bridging these gaps, often stepping in where public health systems fall short – especially in resource-constrained areas or in developed nations where services may be unevenly distributed or deprioritized. NGOs also made contributions to equity by enabling more inclusive access to oral health services by providing direct treatment services and also indirect support. However, the impact of these actions was not well evaluated. As an interface between the community and government, NGOs aim to reduce inequity and play a unique and vital role in helping communities establish health security. 47 Conclusion NGOs play an active role in promoting and improving people’s oral health and well-being by providing both direct and indirect services. The multifaceted involvement of NGOs highlighted their importance in improving oral health outcomes and addressing oral health disparities in broad community settings.
