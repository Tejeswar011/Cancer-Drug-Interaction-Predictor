It is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Infection with hepatitis B and/or C virus is a significant risk factor for developing HCC. These viruses exert their carcinogenicity in both direct and indirect ways, including induction of immune exhaustion with prolonged antigen exposure. Therefore, the best therapeutic option for HCC is prevention, i.e., Hepatitis B vaccination and treatment of viral hepatitis. However, when HCC develops because of viral hepatitis or other etiologies, long-lasting effects on the immune system remain even after viral suppression, which affect the response to HCC therapy. Recent studies have suggested a “hot” and “cold” model for HCC, in which the two kinds of HCC tumors have very distinct tumor microenvironments. The microenvironment for hot HCC makes these tumors amenable to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, converting cold HCC tumors to hot tumors may make them susceptible to immunotherapy. In this review, we provide an overview of HCC epidemiology and prevention, an overview of tumor microenvironments of hot and cold HCC, the proposed mechanisms for converting cold tumors to hot tumors, and a concise summary of the evidence for combination checkpoint inhibitor therapy for HCC. hepatocellular carcinoma treatment immune checkpoint inhibitors hot and cold tumors This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [ 1 2 1 3 4 The pathogenesis of HCC involves a complex interplay of persistent inflammation, aberrant signaling, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and metabolic and genetic alterations [ 5 6 7 8 9 The liver’s immune landscape is inherently tolerogenic by its constant exposure to gut-derived antigens. However, in chronic liver disease, this immune tolerance shifts toward a suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by migration of regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and increased expression of immune-checkpoint molecules such as PD-L1 and CTLA-4 [ 10 11 12 TME also provides the immunological context responsible for the dichotomy of “hot” versus “cold” tumors. Hot tumors are marked by high T-cell infiltration, PD-L1 expression, and an inflamed microenvironment. These tumors generally respond well to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) [ 13 14 15 16 17 Emerging treatment strategies aim to convert cold tumors into hot tumors by modulating TME and enhancing immune infiltration. Approaches include radiotherapy, oncolytic viruses, toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, STING pathway activators, cytokine therapies, and combinations of ICIs with anti-angiogenic agents or epigenetic modulators [ 15 18 19 20 In this review, we aim to summarize the immunobiology of HCC and describe treatment in the context of hot versus cold tumor paradigms. We explore the mechanisms underlying immune exclusion in HCC, review therapeutic strategies aimed at reshaping the TME, and evaluate current and emerging approaches that seek to improve immunotherapy responses for HCC. 2. Epidemiology, Prevention, Screening, and Surveillance HCC is the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and third leading cause of cancer mortality [ 15 16 Since chronic HBV infection is one of the most common risk factors for HCC, the main prevention strategy against HCC is universal HBV vaccination and effective treatment of chronic HBV and HCV infections [ 21 22 23 24 25 22 HCC surveillance is recommended every six months in high-risk patients—such as those with cirrhosis of any etiology or chronic HBV infection—using ultrasound in combination with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which increases sensitivity for early detection from 45% to 63% [ 2 3 26 27 27 27 28 29 30 31 3. Immunopathogenesis The direct cause of malignant transformation from chronic hepatitis infection into HCC is still not well known but is likely a result of persistent hepatic necro-inflammation. In HBV, oncogenesis mainly occurs as a result of viral genome into the host genome, which may increase its mutagenicity in the TERT promoter or p53 suppressor gene [ 1 32 1 33 34 In non-viral etiologies for HCC, the primary mechanisms that contribute to HCC pathogenesis are persistent liver inflammation, abnormal cell signaling, and ER stress [ 34 35 Table 1 Figure 1 Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome—through mitochondrial ATP release and lysosomal disruption—leads to caspase-1–mediated pyroptosis and the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, further amplifying inflammation [ 36 Chronic ER stress and UPR activation promote inflammation through pathways like NF-κB and TNF, contributing to HCC development across all tumor stages [ 5 6 26 Abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway promotes HCC by regulating key glycolytic enzymes, influencing proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism [ 8 9 Deregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, often due to CTNNB1 and AXIN1 mutations, cooperates with other oncogenes to drive HCC and mediate resistance to therapies [ 7 9 miRNAs modulate HCC tumorigenesis by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, affecting apoptosis and pathways like PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin, and influencing initiation, progression, metastasis, and recurrence [ 37 38 Other mechanisms of pathogenesis for HCC are comorbidity specific: MAFLD and obesity key drivers include mutations in TERT, CTNNB1, ACVR2A, and the PNPLA3 I148M variant, as well as CCRK activation by obesity-related inflammation [ 3 39 40 Type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of HCC and its recurrence independently of other factors like obesity, alcohol use, or cirrhosis [ 4 41 42 43 Alcohol-related HCC is driven by ethanol metabolism into acetaldehyde, which causes oxidative stress and ROS accumulation, promoting DNA damage and carcinogenesis [ 44 45 46 47 48 As summarized above, HCC arises from a complex interplay of viral, metabolic, inflammatory, and genetic factors. While chronic HBV and HCV infections remain major etiological drivers, other contributors—such as MAFLD, T2DM, and alcohol use—also significantly elevate risk. Central to HCC pathogenesis are persistent inflammation, aberrant signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the dysregulation of non-coding RNAs. Genetic variants and metabolic disturbances further modulate susceptibility and tumor progression. 4. Tumor Microenvironment The liver’s microenvironment contains a large reservoir of immune cells and maintains homeostasis by being highly tolerogenic to gut bacterial metabolites [ 11 49 49 50 11 51 52 53 54 55 The majority of HCCs arise within a chronically inflamed, immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by diminished T-cell co-stimulatory signaling and increased expression of immune-checkpoint molecules, resulting in impaired T-cell effector function [ 12 17 56 Immune system evasion is partly mediated by immunosuppressive cell populations within the tumor microenvironment, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [ 10 57 11 54 55 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 12 Immune checkpoints—such as PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG3, and TIM3—also play central roles in mediating T-cell exhaustion and promoting immune evasion by interacting with ligands expressed on tumor and stromal cells [ 10 58 69 74 12 69 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 Cytokines such as TGF-β, IL-10, and VEGF contribute to immunosuppression by modulating immune cells [ 11 29 82 83 84 85 The main etiologies of HCC use varied methods for pathogenesis. Chronic antigen presentation invoked by HBV induces T-cell exhaustion and immunosuppression [ 86 87 88 89 The liver microbiome is usually highly tolerogenic to the gut microbiome and bile acid metabolism, resulting in expansion of regulatory T cells induced by IL-10 from Kupffer cells [ 11 49 51 90 91 92 91 93 Figure 2 91 Lachnospiraceae bacterium-GAM79 Alistipes sp Marseille-P5997 94 Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae, Veillonella Prevotella 9 Lachnoclostridium Prevotella 9 95 Overall, the immunosuppressive microenvironment of HCC arises from a complex interplay between chronic inflammation, the gut microbiome, liver-resident and infiltrating immune cells, cytokines, immune checkpoints, tumor-associated stromal cells, and tumor-intrinsic genetic alterations. This multifaceted network fosters immune evasion by impairing cytotoxic T-cell and NK-cell responses, expanding regulatory and suppressive cell populations, and upregulating inhibitory pathways such as PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG3, and TIM3. Understanding these interconnected mechanisms not only elucidates HCC pathogenesis but also highlights multiple therapeutic targets within the tumor microenvironment that may enhance the efficacy of emerging immunotherapy. 5. Hot and Cold HCC Tumors The classification of “hot” and “cold” tumors encompasses characteristics of cancer cells, including the microenvironment of the tumor, immune modulators present, and the signaling mechanisms utilized [ 96 13 Cold and hot tumor microenvironments (TMEs) are distinguished by differing immune cell infiltration and cytokine profiles ( Figure 3 13 14 97 98 98 6. Turning Cold HCC into Hot HCC Early-stage HCC can be treated with surgical resection or liver transplantation. For unresectable HCC, orthotopic liver transplantation—often preceded by bridging therapies such as chemotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization, or percutaneous ablation—offers an effective surgical alternative [ 99 100 The use of immunotherapy to treat HCC has increased in the last decade. Although multiple molecular pathways contribute to HCC pathogenesis, targeted therapies have had limited clinical success. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting Raf-1, B-Raf, VEGFR-1/2/3, and PDGFR-β, remains the most extensively studied agent [ 101 102 p 103 104 105 Treatment failure with sorafenib and other immunotherapies is likely due to the presence of cold HCC. Since immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is effective against hot tumors, modulating the TME to enhance immune infiltration and convert “cold” into “hot” tumors could be effective for improving treatment outcomes [ 96 Figure 4 6.1. ICIs and TKIs Combining ICIs with anti-angiogenic agents or TKIs has emerged as a leading therapeutic strategy for advanced HCC [ 106 107 108 107 109 110 111 NCT05337137 NCT03099109 112 113 Figure 5 6.2. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy has emerged as a promising adjunct to ICIs due to its immunostimulatory effects. By inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), radiotherapy triggers the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including high mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1), calreticulin (CRT), heat shock proteins, and ATP. Radiotherapy also enhances major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, improving antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells [ 114 115 114 114 116 117 6.3. Chemotherapy Although traditionally considered immunosuppressive, chemotherapy has the potential to enhance antitumor immunity in HCC by inducing ICD, releasing neoantigens, and activating Type I IFN signaling that promotes antigen-presenting cell (APC) recruitment [ 118 119 120 121 122 6.4. Oncolytic Viruses (OVs) OVs represent a novel therapeutic class with both direct tumor-lysing and potent immune-stimulating properties, selectively infecting and eliminating cancer cells while sparing normal tissues [ 123 124 116 124 125 6.5. STING (Stimulator of IFN Genes) Pathway The STING pathway plays a pivotal role in innate immunity by sensing cytosolic DNA and inducing Type I IFN responses that enhance antigen presentation and T-cell priming [ 126 126 126 19 6.6. CD47-SIRPa Axis The CD47-SIRPa axis promotes immune evasion in HCC and a cold HCC phenotype since overexpression of CD47 allows HCC tumor cells to transmit inhibitory signals upon binding with SIRPa. Therefore, blocking this axis activates the STING pathway, restores phagocytosis in macrophages and DCs, promotes antigen cross presentation, and enhances recruitment of cytotoxic immune cells (i.e., CD8+ T cells), reprogramming the TME and converting the HCC tumor into a hot phenotype that works synergistically with ICIs, chemotherapies, and radiotherapies [ 123 127 128 6.7. FLT-3L and GM-CSF FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT-3L) and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are important cytokines involved in DC development and function. These cytokines have exhibited emerging therapeutic roles for HCC, by primarily focusing on the recruitment, activation, and maturation of DCs to convert cold HCC into hot HCC. FLT-3L promotes DC proliferation and enhances antitumor immunity through in situ vaccination strategies, such as adenoviral vectors expressing FLT-3L, which have been shown to potentiate radiation therapy and induce Th1 immune response in HCC models [ 129 125 130 6.8. Immune Checkpoint Agonists Agonists targeting co-stimulatory immune-checkpoint receptors such as CD40 and OX40 have shown potential in increasing antitumor immunity in HCC to convert tumors from cold to hot phenotypes. These are an emerging class of agents that are under investigation to target the STING pathway, induce ICD, and promote CD8+ T-cell infiltration via several mechanisms. For example, CD40 is expressed on APCs and interacts with CD40L on activated T cells to promote DC maturation and IL-12 secretion, ultimately stimulating T-cell response. CD40 agonists improve DC activation, increase T-cell infiltration, and suppress tumor progression in preclinical HCC models [ 131 132 132 6.9. VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) Inhibition Tumor progression is supported both by immune evasion and aberrant vascularization, with hypoxia-induced VEGF playing a central role in neovascularization and tumor growth [ 133 134 74 103 104 105 135 136 137 138 6.10. Chemokine Regulation HCC tumors evade the immune system through impaired chemokine signaling. Reduced expression of Th1-type chemokines, such as CXCL9 and CXCL10, contributes to poor CD8+ T-cell recruitment and limited responses to immunotherapy [ 139 140 141 6.11. Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT) ACT therapy, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, enhances tumor-specific immunity by engineering patient-derived immune cells for reinfusion [ 142 143 144 134 145 146 6.12. Vaccines Vaccine-based cancer therapy shows strong potential in enhancing immune recognition of tumors, particularly through neoantigen vaccines that target tumor-specific antigens with high immunogenicity [ 147 148 149 150 151 148 152 6.13. Manipulation of Gut Microbes Mycobacterium anthropophilum Bifidobacterium bifidum 91 91 Lactobacillus rhamnosus Probio-M9, 92 153 154 7. Assessing Cold to Hot HCC Conversion Conversion of cold into hot HCC greatly alters the TME. Therefore, measurement of biomarkers before and after implementing the aforementioned therapies may be beneficial in assessing the tumors’ enhanced potential for response to ICI therapy [ 155 156 Measuring immune cell biomarkers could assess the density of cells responsible for tumor lysis. Specifically, an increase in the density of TILs (i.e., CD8+ T cells) and CXCL9 and CXCL10, which activate T cells and IFNg secretion from effector T cells, would demonstrate conversion of an HCC tumor into the hot phenotype. Though measuring TIL density is not routinely used in clinical practice, it has been identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC [ 157 158 159 160 Measurement of cytokine and signaling pathway biomarkers could also assess for a more pro-inflammatory TME or reduction in a regulatory/immunosuppressive TME, which would characterize hot-to-cold HCC conversion. For example, an increase in PD-L1 and CXCL12 and reduction in TGFB would suggest that these tumors would have a better response to ICI therapy. However, use of PD-L1 as a biomarker is a challenge clinically due to heterogeneity in tissue expression and technical challenges with isolation of the marker [ 161 162 163 164 165 166 Lastly, the assessment of metabolic and genomic factors may guide prediction for ICI response. Reduction in HIF-1a may indicate a tumor more amenable to ICI therapy by altering PD-L1 expression [ 98 8. Conclusions HCC arises from a multifactorial interplay of viral, metabolic, genetic, and inflammatory factors, culminating in a chronically immunosuppressed TME that supports immune evasion and tumor progression [ 5 11 26 17 167 The emerging paradigm of “hot” versus “cold” tumors provide a valuable framework for understanding therapeutic response variability and designing combination strategies for treating HCC. Therapeutic strategies that aim to convert cold HCCs into hot tumors, hold promise for enhancing immune responsiveness [ 18 19 20 141 Moving forward, a deeper understanding of HCC immune subtypes and development of reliable predictive biomarkers will be essential to guide personalized immunotherapy. By tailoring treatments based on tumor immunophenotype, clinicians may overcome immune resistance and achieve more durable and effective responses. Precision immuno-oncologic strategies have the potential to shift the therapeutic landscape and improve outcomes for patients with HCC.
