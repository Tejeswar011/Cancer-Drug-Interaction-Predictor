Introduction Upadacitinib (UPA) is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that modulates the JAK–STAT signaling pathway, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and atopic dermatitis (AD) [ 1 2 3 3 4 5 Upadacitinib is a drug in the JAK inhibitor group. While JAK inhibitors are effective in treating various inflammatory diseases, they also have certain side effects. Tofacitinib, another JAK inhibitor, was first approved for the treatment of RA in 2012 [ 6 7 8 9 Unlike other JAK inhibitors, Upadacitinib has greater selectivity for JAK1 than for JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) [ 10 3 4 5 Real-world data are almost nonexistent, apart from phase studies examining changes in efficacy, side effects, and laboratory parameters in IBD patients receiving Upadacitinib [ 11 12 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Source and Study Population This retrospective cohort study evaluated the efficacy, side effects, and, specifically, the effects of Upadacitinib on laboratory parameters in patients with moderate-to-severe CD or UC. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (protocol no. 2025/750), and all participants provided written informed consent. This study included patients aged 18 years and older who had previously used biologics but lost response, had recently started Upadacitinib, or were undergoing regular follow-up. Patients were excluded if they had a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, liver cirrhosis, or renal failure (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 A total of 53 patients who presented to our clinic between 25 June 2024 and 31 December 2024 were enrolled in this study. Upadacitinib was administered at an induction dose of 45 mg daily for the first 3 and 2 months for CD and UC, respectively. All UC patients completed the standard 2-month induction period, and none required an extended induction with Upadacitinib. Maintenance therapy was continued at 15 mg daily for four patients aged ≥60 years and at 30 mg daily for the remaining patients. Five patients were excluded from this study due to an inability to attend regular follow-up visits, and two patients discontinued treatment during the induction phase because of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. For the evaluation of Upadacitinib persistence, clinical remission, and clinical response, data from an additional five patients were included: two who did not respond to induction therapy (one with UC and one with CD) and three who lost response during maintenance therapy (one with UC and two with CD). These five patients were excluded from analyses of other outcomes. The final study cohort included 22 patients with UC and 19 with CD. For the patients with Crohn’s disease, location and behavior were classified according to the Montreal classification [ 13 2.2. Data Collection Patients were assessed at three time points: baseline (before starting Upadacitinib), and at 3 and 6 months of treatment. All laboratory assessments were performed after at least 8 h of fasting and included measurements of glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TB), albumin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), calcium, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, ferritin, vitamin B12, folic acid, C-reactive protein (CRP), and complete blood counts. All tests were performed in the hospital laboratory using Roche Cobas C501 and Beckman Coulter LH 780 analyzers. Fecal calprotectin (FCAL) was measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Calprotectin [MRP 8/14] [Stool] ELISA, Immundiagnostik AG, Stubenwald-Allee 8a, 64625 Bensheim, Germany) with a linear measurement range of 13–840 μg/g. Adverse events and clinical status were assessed at each visit, and abdominal ultrasonography was performed for all patients to evaluate intestinal activity. Disease severity was determined using the Harvey–Bradshaw Index (HBI) in CD patients and the partial Mayo score (PMS) in UC patients. CD: Clinical response constituted an HBI improvement of ≥3 points, and clinical remission correlated with an HBI < 5. UC: Clinical response was indicated by a PMS improvement of ≥2 points, and clinical remission a PMS < 2. Active disease was defined by CRP > 5 mg/L and/or clinical, endoscopic, or radiographic evidence of activity, and/or FCAL ≥ 250 μg/g. 2.3. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics for demographic and laboratory parameters are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. The Shapiro–Wilk test was applied to assess the normality of distributions. For comparisons of laboratory parameters at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, paired t p 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics The study cohort comprised 41 patients, of whom 15 (36.6%) were female. The mean age of our patients, which ranged from 21 to 69 years, was 43.6 ± 14.3 years, and the mean disease duration was 8.1 ± 5.1 years (ranging from 2 to 24 years). UC patients were older than CD patients (UC: 48 ± 15.4 years vs. CD: 38.1 ± 10.7 years), but the mean disease duration was similar (UC: 7.8 ± 4.4 years vs. CD: 8.5 ± 5.9 years). Seventeen (41.5%) patients were current smokers. Before starting Upadacitinib, 46.3% of our patients ( n Table 1 Upadacitinib has been in use in Turkey for over a year. Before its introduction, only anti-TNF (Infliximab, Adalimumab), anti-integrin (Vedolizumab), and anti-interleukin (IL)-12/23 (Ustekinumab) molecules were used as biological agents in IBD patients. Except for one UC patient, all 40 patients (97.6%) were anti-TNF-experienced. The most commonly used biologic was infliximab, which was used by 26 patients (63.4%). Prior use of azathioprine was noted in 36 patients (87.8%), representing a large majority of the study cohort. Methotrexate is not the most preferred drug for IBD treatment in our country and at our clinic. A total of 11 patients (26.8%; 6 with CD, 5 with UC) who began Upadacitinib induction therapy were also started on concomitant corticosteroids ( Table 2 3.2. Upadacitinib and Efficacy As previously mentioned, two patients (one with UC, one with CD) were excluded from this study due to a lack of response to induction therapy, and three patients (one with UC, two with CD) were excluded due to a loss of response to maintenance therapy. Two additional patients (one with UC, one with CD) were also excluded because they were unable to use the medication due to side effects such as nausea and vomiting. At the end of the sixth month, one patient with CD developed a perianal abscess, leading to a loss of efficacy. Based on these data, the persistence rates of Upadacitinib at the end of the sixth month were 78.3% for CD and 88% for UC. According to the partial Mayo score (PMS) calculated before Upadacitinib treatment, 20 (90.9%) of 22 UC patients were in the moderate-to-severe group. After 6 months of treatment, this number decreased to two (9.1%) ( Table 3 p Table 3 Figure 1 According to the Harvey–Bradshaw Index (HBI) calculated before Upadacitinib treatment, 14 (73.7%) of the CD patients were in the moderate-to-severe group. At 6 months of Upadacitinib treatment, the rate of patients with an HBI < 5 was found to be 57.9% ( Table 4 p Table 4 Figure 2 3.3. Upadacitinib and Laboratory Parameters and Side Effects When the effect of Upadacitinib on laboratory parameters was evaluated, it was found that it did not cause clinically significant changes in glucose, HbA1c, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, total bilirubin, creatinine, TSH, or FT4 levels ( p p Table 5 p Upadacitinib increased total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and HDL-C levels, but did not change triglyceride levels or the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Increases in TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels peaked in the third month of treatment. Compared to month 3, a partial reduction was observed at month 6 (the decline in LDL-C was not statistically significant, while the decreases in TC and HDL-C levels were statistically significant). Despite this, these values remained significantly higher than pre-Upadacitinib values ( Table 5 Figure 3 During Upadacitinib use, one patient developed herpes zoster, and three developed acne. One patient developed urticaria. A perianal abscess developed in one patient at the end of month 6, requiring inpatient treatment. This patient’s medication was changed due to a loss of efficacy. In addition to this case, three non-serious upper respiratory tract infections, one case of pneumonia, one case of cystitis, and one case of vaginitis were reported in outpatients. Two patients experienced severe side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, during induction therapy that prevented them from taking the medication, and these two patients were withdrawn from this study. Some patients also experienced non-serious symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and myalgia, which did not impair their quality of life ( Table 6 4. Discussion Upadacitinib is a more selective JAK inhibitor that has recently been used in both UC and CD patients. Both phase studies and limited real-world data have demonstrated its efficacy. Other JAK inhibitors have been used for many years in the treatment of various diseases, and some studies have highlighted their safety issues and side effect profiles. We aimed to investigate the effects of Upadacitinib on efficacy, side effects, and laboratory parameters in biologic-experienced IBD patients, 46.3% of whom had previously used more than one biologic. Among our fully biologic-experienced UC patients, 40.8% had previously used more than one biologic. Of these patients, 31.8% had left-sided colitis, and 72.2% had extensive or pancolitis. For maintenance therapy, 90.9% of our patients received 30 mg of Upadacitinib. At the end of the sixth month, we found a persistence rate of 88%, a clinical response rate of 83.3%, and a clinical remission rate of 58.3% in UC patients. Pre-treatment FCAL levels were 521 ± 246 µg/g, and CRP was 74 ± 55 mg/L. At the end of the sixth month, 81.8% of patients had FCAL < 250 µg/g and CRP < 5 mg/L. Our clinical remission rate after 8 weeks of induction therapy was 45.5%. In phase 3 studies (U-ACHIEVE induction [UC1] and U-ACCOMPLISH [UC2]), the clinical remission rates were 26% and 34%, respectively, in induction therapy, while the clinical response rate according to the PMS was 79%. In the maintenance study (U-ACHIEVE maintenance [UC3]), the clinical remission rate at the end of week 52 was 51.7% in the Upadacitinib 30 mg arm (61.2% according to the PMS) [ 3 14 15 Among our CD patients who had experienced at least one biologic, 52.7% had previously received more than one advanced therapy. The most common sites of involvement were the ileum (53.6%) and the ileocolon (31.6%). Regarding disease behavior, 31.6% of patients had perianal involvement (P), 63.2% had inflammatory disease (B1), and 21.1% had penetrating disease (B3). For maintenance therapy, 89.5% of our patients received 30 mg of Upadacitinib. At the end of the sixth month, we found a persistence rate of 78.3%, a clinical response rate of 72.7%, and a clinical remission rate of 50% in our CD patients. The pre-treatment fecal calprotectin (FCAL) level was 257 ± 198 µg/g, and that of CRP was 23 ± 16 mg/L. At the end of the sixth month, the proportion of patients with FCAL levels above 250 µg/g and CRP levels exceeding 5 mg/L was 10.2%. Our clinical remission rate during 12 weeks of induction therapy was 47.4%. In phase 3 studies (U-EXCEL and U-EXCEED), the clinical remission rates during induction therapy were found to be 49.5% and 38.9%, respectively [ 2 4 In our study, Upadacitinib increased total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and HDL-C levels, but did not change triglyceride levels or the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. The increases in TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels showed a partial decrease in the sixth month of treatment compared to the third month. Still, these values remained significantly higher than pre-Upadacitinib values. Studies in IBD patients have found that blood lipid levels may decrease during periods of inflammation [ 16 17 18 3 19 n 20 In our study, Upadacitinib did not cause a significant change in glucose, HbA1c, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, total bilirubin, creatinine, TSH, or FT4 levels ( p p 21 22 2 3 In our study, a decrease in platelet, leukocyte, and neutrophil levels was observed, while lymphocyte and hemoglobin levels remained stable. No patient had a hemogram change that fell to critical levels (e.g., lymphocytes < 500/µL). In phase studies that included both induction and maintenance therapy, neutropenia was observed in 1.2% to 6% of patients receiving Upadacitinib, and lymphopenia in 1.4% to 6%; this rate was significantly higher compared to the placebo arm. In these studies, the rate of anemia was found to be lower in UC patients compared to the placebo arm. However, in CD patients, while no definitive conclusion could be drawn, the rate was generally slightly higher in the Upadacitinib arm [ 2 3 3 23 The overall side effect rate in our patient cohort was 48.8%, with infections being the most common at 17.1%. The most frequent symptom was nausea and vomiting (9.8%), while one patient experienced herpes zoster, and three experienced acne (7.3%). Except for one perianal abscess that required inpatient treatment, all other patients were treated as outpatients and did not require drug discontinuation. No embolism, acute coronary syndrome, or death occurred in any of our patients. The high side effect rate in our study is likely attributed to our meticulous recording of even mild symptoms. We observed no serious side effects, unlike those reported in phase studies [ 2 3 24 4 14 15 22 Study Limitations and Strengths The small number of patients and the lack of long-term follow-up are the main weaknesses of our study. A significant limitation of our study is the absence of systematically collected data on endoscopic remission, despite its growing importance in IBD treatment. This is one of the few real-world studies outside of phase trials that includes both induction and short-term maintenance therapy. Furthermore, this study is the first to evaluate the effects of Upadacitinib on laboratory parameters in IBD, including glucose, HbA1c, and thyroid function tests (FT4 and TSH). 5. Conclusions This real-world study confirms that Upadacitinib is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for biologic-experienced patients with moderate-to-severe IBD. We observed high rates of clinical response and remission within six months, supported by a significant reduction in key disease markers, including fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein. The drug’s safety profile was favorable, with no serious adverse events, venous thromboembolisms, or major cardiovascular events reported. While Upadacitinib increased cholesterol levels, it did not demonstrate a negative effect on the LDL/HDL ratio or glucose metabolism. Our findings support the use of Upadacitinib in biologic-unresponsive IBD patients. However, further multicenter, longer-term studies are required to evaluate its long-term safety and efficacy.
