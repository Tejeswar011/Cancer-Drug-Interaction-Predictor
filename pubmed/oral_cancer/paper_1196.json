While organ transplantation offers prospective treatment, it remains suboptimal. The scarcity of donor organs and the need for lifelong immunosuppressive treatments highlight the necessity for innovative approaches in regenerative medicine. In response, tissue engineering has emerged as a promising alternative, particularly through advancements in three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) printing technologies. These approaches enable the fabrication of complex, patient-specific constructs for regenerating tissues such as skin, bone, cartilage, and vascularized organs. This review systematically examines 3D printing techniques, commonly used biomaterials (e.g., hydrogels, bio-inks, and polymers), and their applications in dermal, cardiovascular, bone, and neural regeneration.

Introduction Recent advancements in three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies result from the inherent capacity of the human body to self-repair and regenerate [ 1 2 TE is an interdisciplinary field focused on creating three-dimensional tissues by combining human cells and bioactive scaffolds [ 3 4 5 6 7 5 One of the principal advantages of three-dimensional (3D) printing lies in its capacity to fabricate highly complex structures that would otherwise fall into exorbitant costs if manufactured through conventional techniques [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 Due to the emerging importance of 3D printing technologies in biomedical applications, this manuscript provides a thorough and contemporary review of the role of 3D printing in tissue engineering. Initially, the foundational principles of 3D printing techniques relevant to tissue engineering are described. Subsequently, the main materials used in these technologies are examined and talked about. Furthermore, this work looks at different ways that 3D printing can be used in tissue engineering, with a focus on how it can help regenerate different types of tissue, such as skin, bone, heart, blood vessels, and nerve tissue. This approach is supported by functional comparisons and performance metrics. This method is complemented by the inclusion of 4D bioprinting, an emerging field that expands the capabilities of additive manufacturing toward dynamic and adaptive structures, with direct implications for next-generation tissue engineering. Finally, the article talks about the problems and ethical issues that come up when using 3D printing in this area. 2. Fundamentals of 3D Printing in Tissue Engineering 2.1. Three-Dimensional Printing Principle Additive manufacturing (AM) is the main principle of 3D printing. Unlike conventional manufacturing techniques, AM builds a three-dimensional structure by sequentially adding material layers. This layer-by-layer method enables the accurate formation of complex shapes and designs [ 14 Figure 1 2.2. Techniques Behind 3D Printing The layer processing technique and the materials used are the main factors that affect the choice of the right fabrication method [ 15 6 16 17 18 19 Table 1 2.3. Materials for 3D Printing in Tissue Engineering Tissue engineering presents substantial prospects for the restoration or substitution of damaged tissues and organs. Scaffolds composed of biomaterials play a fundamental role in this endeavor, providing structural integrity and promoting an environment that enhances cellular proliferation and tissue regeneration. Biomaterials are widely used to build different types of tissues, such as skin [ 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 2 49 50 51 52 Table 2 2.3.1. Natural Polymers Natural polymers, including substances like collagen [ 53 54 55 56 57 58 6 39 bioengineering-12-00936-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Commonly printed polymers for tissue engineering applications.

PCL: Polycaprolactone; PGA: polyglycolic acid; PLA: Polylactic acid; PLGA: poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid); PEG: Polyethylene glycol; PVA: Polyvinyl alcohol. 2.3.2. Hydrogels Hydrogels are polymeric networks that are cross-linked and have a lot of water in them. Because they let oxygen through so easily, they are used a lot in biomedical engineering [ 71 72 73 72 74 75 Hydrogels suitable for three-dimensional printing can be categorized into two principal classifications: natural hydrogels and synthetic hydrogels. Natural hydrogels originate from protein sources such as gelatin, collagen, and silk or from polysaccharides, including chitosan, agarose, hyaluronic acid, alginate, and cellulose. Additionally, synthetic hydrogels such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyurethane, and polyacrylamide are also extensively used [ 76 2.3.3. Synthetic Polymers Synthetic polymers have obtained significant attention in biomedical and pharmaceutical investigations due to their wide availability, biocompatibility, biodegradable nature, and ease of handling, making them highly suitable for a wide range of applications in these fields [ 75 6 The most common biomedical polymers synthetic used in 3D printing for tissue engineering applications are PLA [ 77 39 78 79 80 81 82 6 2.3.4. Bio-Inks “Bio-ink” refers to inks containing cells or cell aggregates, which are embedded in biomaterials and organized in a 3D structure [ 83 84 85 For bio-inks to work well in 3D bioprinting, they need to have a number of important properties. These include being able to be printed well, having good mechanical properties, being able to be functionally changed for specific tissue applications, being biodegradable in a controlled way, and not being toxic. For cells to stay alive, nutrients to move around, and metabolic processes to speed up during tissue development, non-toxicity is very important [ 86 There are four main types of bio-inks: hydrogels, microcarriers, cellular aggregates, and decellularized matrix constituents. There are three main types of cellular aggregates: tissue spheroids, cell pellets, and tissue strands [ 87 Figure 2 2.4. Parameters for 3D Printing in Tissue Engineering 2.4.1. Design Inputs: General Considerations, Materials, and Cell Types The fabrication of biomimetic scaffolds with 3D printing, there are a few important things to consider. These include carefully choosing the correct materials for cell-laden and acellular scaffolds, improving the ways that materials are processed, and choosing the right types of cells to integrate. For instance, polymers must be sterilized, usually by filtering them, and they must be handled in a sterile, strictly controlled environment. Additionally, all components involved in the printing process, including the nozzle, cartridge, and platform, need to be sterilized to ensure sterility throughout the operation. To maintain cell viability, which is crucial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, the entire printing process must take place in a sterile setting, such as a biosafety cabinet [ 88 2.4.2. Scaffold Properties to Consider Three-dimensional, porous scaffolds that are seeded with cells are often used in tissue engineering to provide the structure support. The base material and the methods used to make these scaffolds determine how well they work. These scaffolds act as barriers, keeping nearby tissues from getting into the treatment area while also providing temporary support for the new tissue. Cells can attach, grow, move, and change on these surfaces. Scaffolds also act as carriers for cells, making sure they stay in the right place and spread out properly, which helps new tissue grow. In addition, scaffolds help with vascularization, tissue growth, and remodeling while also making it easier for nutrients, growth factors, and waste products to move around [ 89 To do their designated functions, scaffolds must meet several important requirements. They need to be biocompatible so that they do not cause bad physiological reactions, and they also need to be biodegradable so that they break down naturally and can be removed by the organism. Also, the rate at which the material breaks down must match the time it takes for the tissue to heal. In addition, scaffolds must have mechanical properties that are like the tissue they are meant to replace, as well as the best structural properties, such as pore size, interconnectivity, and permeability. They should also be able to be shaped into complicated three-dimensional shapes. The tissue’s reaction to scaffolds depends on several things, such as the size and shape of the implant, how it reacts chemically, how it breaks down, the site of implantation, and the traits of the host species. Furthermore, the material must promote effective cell–material interactions that match the specific requirements of the local tissue environment [ 90 91 2.4.3. Selection of Biomaterials Selecting the appropriate material is one of the most significant challenges in scaffold-based tissue engineering. For multilayered scaffolds designed for 3D printing, it is crucial to choose materials that closely match the mechanical and biological properties of the target tissue [ 92 88 93 2.4.4. Biological Interactions and Cell Types It is crucial for researchers to assess the tolerance of specific cell types before employing them in their research, as bioprinting necessitates a diverse array of bio-ink components, processing requirements, and environmental conditions. Fibroblasts and transformed cell lines are two types of cells that have been employed in numerous bioprinting studies due to their capacity to grow rapidly and maintain a long lifespan. These cells have demonstrated their ability to withstand the stressors associated with the construction of a structure, including exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and shear forces [ 91 Bioprinting makes it easier to make complex tissues, like adding stem cells and chondrocytes to layers of a hydrogel to help cartilage grow back. However, this high level of control must be carefully balanced with the preservation of the potential of undifferentiated stem cells, making sure that their ability to differentiate and regenerate tissue is not compromised during the process [ 94 95 An essential element of cell–material interactions is matrix remodeling, a process that depends on the cell’s ability to alter its microenvironment and the material’s ability to accommodate these changes. For example, natural polymer hydrogels have different binding sites, biochemical signals, and endogenous factors that help cells do things that are similar to what they do in their natural environment. However, controlling these natural polymers becomes more complex when studying specific metabolic pathways or signaling mechanisms. The extracellular matrix (ECM) signals they send out are not always the same, and different batches of natural materials are not always the same, which makes things even harder [ 96 96 97 2.4.5. Print Outputs: Infill, Resolution, Porous Architecture Using the most recent 3D printing technologies, tissue engineers have created heterogeneous, multilayered scaffolds that more closely resemble the biochemical and structural properties of native tissues. This was achieved by meticulously selecting tissue-specific design parameters. The majority of tissues that tissue engineering is designed to target are situated in intricate, heterogeneous environments that involve the interaction of blood vessels and connective tissues with the target tissue. This results in a diverse array of physical and biochemical characteristics [ 92 98 88 2.4.6. Print Resolution To precisely pattern growth factors or biochemical cues within the scaffold and accurately copy architectural features, it is crucial to have a high print resolution [ 99 92 99 100 99 101 59 97 100 102 2.4.7. Porous Architecture Establishing interconnected porosity is crucial in three-dimensional printing for tissue engineering. Scaffolds must facilitate the diffusion of nutrients and waste products while supporting cellular migration during tissue regeneration. Although three-dimensional printing can create high-resolution porous architectures, achieving uniform porosity throughout the layer-by-layer deposition process poses a challenge. If the material is too soft, or if the fibers between successive layers do not fuse properly, the structural integrity of the scaffold may be compromised, potentially leading to the collapse of the pores [ 103 104 105 106 107 2.4.8. Assessment of Scaffold Fidelity It is essential to evaluate how closely the printed scaffolds match their digital models both during and after the printing process. To facilitate the evaluation, many 3D printers are equipped with camera systems that capture real-time, top-down images of the scaffold after each layer is printed [ 108 59 3. Three-Dimensional Printing Applications in Tissue Engineering Organ failure is a significant global challenge that demands urgent attention. While organ transplantation offers a potential solution to organ failure, it remains far from a perfect remedy. The continuous need for organs and long-term dependence on immunosuppressive treatments drive the demand for advanced technologies. In this context, additive manufacturing has emerged as a promising approach to fabricate a variety of tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, and even complex, vascularized organs like the liver, kidneys, and heart, using bio-inks as building materials [ 109 Choosing the right biomaterials for tissue engineering applications is crucial, as different materials are suited for different purposes. However, selecting a proper polymer is only part of the process; the intrinsic properties of the biomaterials are equally important. Researchers must thoroughly understand material properties to select the most suitable materials for successful scaffold fabrication [ 86 14 3.1. Dermal Regeneration The skin is the largest organ in the human body, comprising three layers: the epidermis (the outermost layer), the dermis (the vascularized layer), and the hypodermis (which contains adipose tissue) [ 110 111 112 113 Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a hydrophilic polymer commonly used in various tissue engineering applications. For example, Singh and Jonnalagadda (2021) [ 114 115 116 117 10 118 Table 3 3.2. Bone Tissues Bone is a highly organized connective tissue characterized by a cross-linked matrix architecture. The processes of bone regeneration and remodeling are essential for restoring its structural integrity and functional capacity in pathological conditions such as osteoporosis, cancer therapies, and skeletal injuries. Currently, the primary emphasis in bone regeneration research is focused on enhancing regenerative potential and mimicking the physiological conditions of human bone [ 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 76 128 129 130 131 132 −2 Table 4 In addition to the scaffold designs, recent studies have shown the benefits of piezoelectric scaffolds, as they can mimic the electromechanical behavior of natural bone tissue. Bone has piezoelectricity due to the way collagen fibers are organized. When a mechanical load is applied, small electrical potentials are created that activate bone formation [ 133 3 134 3.3. Cardiovascular Tissues The circulatory system plays a critical role in transporting essential nutrients, gases, and foreign substances throughout the body. Disruptions in the cardiovascular system can lead to various disorders, many of which may result in health complications or even death. While organ transplantation is often considered the most effective treatment for cardiac and circulatory issues, the limited availability of donors presents significant challenges related to biological compatibility. In response to these challenges, advancements in 3D printing technology have enabled the fabrication of specific tissues using appropriate biological materials. This innovation aims to improve the outcomes of transplantation by enhancing compatibility and alignment with the physiological requirements of the body [ 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 Table 5 3.4. Neural Regeneration Neurons are essential components of the nervous system, responsible for transmitting electrical impulses between tissues and organs. However, neurodegenerative disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent, limiting the natural regeneration of damaged neurons. In this context, advancements in 3D printing technology have opened new avenues for addressing neuron repair and regeneration [ 14 146 147 148 149 150 151 Table 6 4. Advantages of 3D Printing in Tissue Engineering Three-dimensional bioprinting has become a leading method in biomedical engineering for the fabrication of tissue, offering several significant advantages. First, it guarantees high precision and reproducibility in producing complex structures. Second, it allows for faster prototype development and design refinement. Third, three-dimensional bioprinting can accurately co-deposit cells and biomaterials, something that traditional methods often struggle to achieve. Lastly, by combining engineering principles, materials science, and manufacturing techniques, it enables the fabrication of intricate microstructures that promote cellular proliferation. The subsequent sections will thoroughly explore these aspects of contemporary three-dimensional printing technology [ 153 These advantages are translated into the capacity to confront the most pressing issues of modern medicine within the broader context of biomedical research. These include the necessity of reducing reliance on long-term immunosuppressive therapies, the limited availability of organs and tissues for transplantation, and the urgency of developing physiologically pertinent models for disease study and drug testing. The incorporation of engineering principles, materials science, and cell biology into high-precision additive manufacturing platforms facilitates the production of biomimetic scaffolds that are customized for each patient, as well as the development of personalized in vitro models, scalable regenerative therapies for clinical use, and organ-on-chip systems [ 154 4.1. Quality and Reproducibility in Complicated Fabrication Systems 3D printing is better than older methods of tissue engineering. It makes these older methods better by adding automation and allowing for more precise and tailored use in certain situations [ 155 156 157 158 153 159 155 160 161 Despite these advancements, it remains challenging to create intricate tissue architecture with high precision. The natural properties of materials, printer resolution limitations, and variations in processing conditions frequently reproducibility challenging to attain. For instance, the reliability of the results may be compromised by variations in the properties of bio-inks, fluctuations in environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, and the durability of the tissues that were constructed. Additionally, the layer-by-layer deposition method may result in defects that render the material less useful and less durable. Other issues include the disintegration of biomaterials, which complicates the replication of results over time, challenges associated with maintaining high resolution while scaling tissue constructs for clinical use, and variations in the viability of cells and their distribution in printed scaffolds. One approach to addressing these issues is to implement real-time monitoring systems that employ machine learning algorithms to autonomously adjust parameters. Innovative hybrid fabrication techniques, such as the integration of 3D printing with electrospinning or molding, have the potential to enhance the precision of structures. Additionally, the printing process may be rendered less variable by establishing calibration protocols and ensuring that bio-ink formulations are more consistent. 4.2. Development Prototypes with Features That Can Be Rapidly Modified Conventional methods for fabricating mechanical parts, biological scaffolds, and implants can be both time-consuming and costly when producing structures with intricate geometries. On the other hand, 3D printing is a flexible solution that facilitates the production of complex shapes that are difficult to produce using traditional methods, such as machining or molding [ 100 162 163 164 153 Rapid prototyping simplifies the process by simplifying the creation of custom tissue models; however, it also necessitates the implementation of specialized software and hardware modifications. Additionally, the cells’ capacity to survive may be compromised by the mechanical and thermal stresses that result from expediting the printing process. Some of the most significant challenges include ensuring that customized features are safe for living organisms, achieving a balance between speed and accuracy in printing, and addressing the fact that certain materials are incompatible with the rapid construction of structures due to their reduced strength. Some potential solutions include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the design of scaffold architectures that are tailored to specific tissues, the development of biomaterials that remain stable during rapid printing while simultaneously supporting cellular functions, and the integration of multi-material printing systems to facilitate the simultaneous deposition of structural and bioactive elements. 4.3. Providing Cells with Excellent Precision 3D bioprinting allows putting all the important parts needed to generate tissue-like structures, like cells, extracellular matrix materials, and growth factors, in the right place at the same time. Three-dimensional bioprinting is better for cells than traditional methods like freeze-drying or using organic solvents, which can hurt cells. Techniques like nozzle-based bioprinting have been used to put cells directly onto surfaces. The technique has made it possible to make complex structures like endothelial networks using bio-inks that contain cells [ 165 101 166 7 167 168 169 170 But getting the cells spread evenly throughout the printed structure is still a big problem. Shear forces that cells experience during extrusion-based bioprinting can damage them and make them less viable. Furthermore, making sure that there are enough oxygen and nutrients in densely populated cell-laden structures is even harder. Cell aggregation and uneven distribution in the bio-ink before or during printing are two of the main problems. Another problem is that the current nozzle design technology is not advanced enough to allow for precise cell deposition. There are also problems with keeping cells alive and working well overtime. Some possible ways to solve these problems are to make more advanced bio-inks with adjustable rheological properties to make cell suspensions more stable, to use acoustic or magnetic patterning techniques to control where cells are located, and to add vascular-like networks that can be perfused to improve the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen after the printing process. 4.4. Engineering in Highly Controllable Microenvironments To achieve successful tissue engineering results, it is essential to fabricate specific microstructures from a bionic perspective. Three-dimensional bioprinting provides a rapid and precise method for the creation of scaffolds that incorporate these essential microstructures, thereby assuring an optimal environment for cell survival and proliferation prior to transplantation. Not only do these scaffolds function as an instrument for tissue regeneration, but they also play a significant role in drug delivery [ 171 172 173 174 175 159 71 176 The internal microstructure of a scaffold, specifically its porosity and pore size, has a substantial impact on its suitability for tissue engineering applications. According to research, the optimal pore diameter for cell migration and mobility within the constructs is approximately 17.08 ± 6.7 µm. This is consistent with the objective of 3D bioprinting, which is to attain a high resolution that is comparable to that of natural tissue, with a target of ≤100 µm [ 177 178 179 177 180 In contrast, the replication of physiologically pertinent microenvironments is crucial for the proper functioning of tissues; however, it poses substantial obstacles. The replication of the native extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture and functionality is a common challenge for current bioprinting techniques, which can impede the maturation of printed tissues. The regulation of complex cellular interactions within three-dimensional constructs, the incorporation of dynamic environmental stimuli such as mechanical forces and electrical signals, and the achievement of tissue-specific stiffness gradients that facilitate cellular differentiation and functionality are some challenges that 3D printing has to address. Development of intelligent biomaterials that respond to external stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, or light) to adjust microenvironments post-printing, employing microfluidic-assisted bioprinting for precise delivery of biochemical signals and growth factors, and incorporating in situ bioreactors to provide mechanical and electrical stimulation during the tissue maturation process, are potential strategies to address these challenges. 4.5. Patterning of Multiple Inks A notable advancement in the fields of 3D printing and bioprinting is the development of printers capable of simultaneously depositing multiple inks. Both commercially available and custom-built printers now feature multiple material cartridges or printheads, allowing them to manage materials with distinct printing requirements. For example, the Integrated Tissue-Organ Printer (ITOP) system utilizes a multicartridge module to concurrently deposit cell-encapsulated hydrogels, sacrificial cell-free hydrogels, and PCL, facilitating the creation of complex, vascularized structures with precise cell patterning [ 92 181 182 183 One of the main challenges to the development of complicated heterogeneous scaffolds is the precise positioning of growth factors and other biochemical signals through the integration of multiple inks into a single construct. For example, the strategic delivery of factors that support tissue formation and stimulate angiogenesis is necessary for vascularized tissue constructions. Similarly, it is important to establish spatial patterns of growth factors that are specific to each tissue type to replicate the natural architecture of heterogeneous tissues, such as tendons, which exhibit a gradient from bone to connective tissue to muscle. This can be achieved by utilizing advanced multicartridge printing systems to deposit multiple pigments with varying growth factor compositions in specific regions [ 88 92 92 184 88 92 185 185 Furthermore, the concurrent deposition of a variety of biomaterials presents substantial obstacles, such as phase separation, compromised structural integrity, and incompatibility between distinct bio-inks. Cross-contamination between cell-laden pigments may also impair tissue functionality and alter cellular behavior. The primary obstacles include the preservation of the individual properties of multiple biomaterials while achieving high-resolution co-deposition, the development of effective post-processing techniques to reinforce multi-ink constructs, and the maintenance of the viability and phenotype of diverse cell types within heterogeneous contexts. The integration of microfluidic dispensing mechanisms to meticulously regulate ink composition and deposition, the implementation of programmable bio-inks with controlled degradation profiles for sequential tissue maturation, and the refinement of multi-nozzle printing systems with autonomous regulation of deposition parameters are potential solutions. Anthony Atala provides a solution after engineering a tissue, he calls this post-processing period, maturation process, where ex vivo structures, cells, and scaffolds are stimulated into bioreactors with physiological stress and maturation factors to enhance differentiation and cell growth, in his words there are two kinds of scaffolds, cellular and acellular, the first one are made by biomaterials and they need the cells in the recipient for tissue formation, the second one is made by actual cells, which also serve as cell transplantation vehicles. In both cases tissue growth depends on cell populations and finally biocompatibility [ 182 5. Present Technical Challenges and Deficiencies in 3D Printing In tissue engineering, the three-dimensional printing is a groundbreaking method that enables the creation of complex materials with suitable mechanical and structural properties. Furthermore, it makes it easier to directly implant living cells with complex biological functions, which helps organs, tissues, and scaffolds grow back. There are still many problems that need to be solved, especially when it comes to the technical, material, and cellular complexities of the printing process. To keep this technology growing and getting better, we must face these challenges head-on [ 186 5.1. Biocompatibility and Quality of Materials There is a requirement for enhancements in the compatibility of biomaterials, printing resolution, and rapidity from a technological perspective. The primary constraint on the resolution of inkjet and extrusion-based bioprinting [ 187 188 189 187 190 5.2. Selection of the Materials The selection of appropriate materials is a critical challenge in the field of 3D bioprinting. These materials must possess biocompatibility, compatibility with printing processes, and mechanical properties that are adequate to maintain cellular viability. Biomimetic materials, including decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) bio-inks, are frequently utilized to replicate the natural architecture of tissues and improve regenerative outcomes. Nevertheless, the structural integrity of dECM bio-inks may be compromised by their inadequate mechanical strength, which is an important disadvantage. Stronger materials, such as PCL, are employed in conjunction with dECM to mitigate this issue, despite their reduced bioactivity [ 191 153 192 193 194 18 5.3. Enhancements in Cell Behavior of Bioprinted Structures It is widely acknowledged that the biological activity of certain cells is not maintained after the 3D bioprinting procedure. However, the functionality and quality of the printed structures, which are essential to the overall success of bioprinting, are still significantly influenced by cellular behavior. At present, the viability of cells within 3D bioprinter structures is frequently compromised in vitro. It is important that cells maintain tissue homeostasis, exhibit appropriate proliferation, and maintain viability to assure the development of functional bioprinter constructs. The functionality of the construction is critically determined by the survival rate of cells following bioprinting. The bioprinting process is rendered ineffective if the cell survival rate is insufficient or the cells die [ 153 195 5.4. Regulation and Ethical Issues In addition to the technological and material challenges, the increasing accessibility of personalized 3D printing and home 3D printers has raised significant concerns regarding the regulation and oversight of certain printed products. A notable issue is the potential for unregulated, do it yourself (DIY) applications of 3D printing in tissue fabrication. Additionally, there is concern that bioprinting technologies could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as bioterrorism, facilitating the creation of bioweapons that threaten public safety [ 196 197 198 In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not currently have specific regulations for biological, cellular, or tissue-based products created using 3D printing. The agency’s Technical Considerations for Additive Manufactured Devices notes that such products fall outside the scope of standard guidelines, as they “may require additional regulatory and manufacturing process considerations and/or different regulatory pathways” [ 199 197 200 Figure 3 6. Four-Dimensional Bioprinting for Biomedical Applications: Engineering Responsive and Dynamic Living Systems The incorporation of the temporal dimension into biofabrication strategies has marked a significant shift in the evolution of bioprinting technologies. While 3D bioprinting enables the construction of structurally complex and biologically relevant tissues, it remains inherently static. In contrast, 4D bioprinting introduces the capacity for temporal transformation, allowing printed constructs to respond dynamically to external or physiological stimuli. This innovation transcends the traditional goal of replicating anatomical form by integrating adaptive functionality, a hallmark of living tissues [ 201 The essence of 4D bioprinting lies in the post-fabrication responsiveness of constructs. This is achieved through the integration of stimuli-responsive biomaterials, often referred to as smart materials, capable of undergoing reversible or programmed changes in their physical, chemical, or biological properties in response to environmental cues such as temperature, pH, mechanical stress, humidity, or light. Through this behavior, constructions can emulate dynamic biological processes such as pulsation, morphing, or selective release of biochemical factors [ 202 203 In regenerative medicine, 4D bioprinting facilitates the design of next-generation implants and devices, such as stents that expand autonomously in response to body temperature or valve-like structures that adapt to hemodynamic changes [ 204 205 206 207 The conceptual distinction between 3D and 4D bioprinting extends beyond incorporating time as a variable. While 3D bioprinting emphasizes form and replication, 4D bioprinting focuses on transformation and interaction. Its objective is not solely to create tissue analogs but to design responsive systems that evolve, adapt, and interact with their biological environment, mirroring the dynamic complexity of life itself [ 208 209 Ultimately, 4D bioprinting represents a convergence of materials science, cell biology, and computational design, pushing the boundaries of engineered life. It initiates a transition from static constructs to reactive, co-evolving systems, where biofabricated tissues are not only built but also programmed to behave, positioning the field at the cutting edge of personalized, dynamic medicine. Table 7 7. Comparative Analysis of 3D and 4D Printing Technologies for Biomedical Applications and Tissue Engineering 3D printing has revolutionized tissue engineering by enabling the development of complex, patient-specific scaffolds with precise control over material composition, pore architecture, and geometry. It can incorporate various biomaterials, such as natural and synthetic polymers and composites. This has facilitated the development of scaffolds designed for dermal, bone, cardiovascular, and neuronal regeneration. However, 3D-printed structures are generally static, meaning their structural and functional characteristics remain unchanged after the manufacturing process. This characteristic can limit their functionality in dynamic biological environments, where long-term integration and functionality could be improved through adaptive responses to stimuli such as pH changes, biochemical signals, or mechanical stress [ 210 On the other hand, 4D printing expands on the principles of 3D printing by integrating stimuli-responsive smart materials that can withstand changes in shape, mechanical properties, and biochemical presentation over time. This can adapt to physiological conditions by responding to environmental stimuli such as temperature, light, and humidity after fabrication [ 211 Table 7 8. Conclusions Additive manufacturing, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) printing, has emerged as a pivotal technological advancement in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. By facilitating the creation of physiologically relevant tissues, it presents the potential for improved and consistent functional outcomes for patients. The development of 3D printing technology has led to the introduction of a variety of methodologies for tissue fabrication, including inkjet printing, laser-assisted bioprinting, stereolithography, digital light processing, and extrusion-based techniques. These methods afford superior spatial control, precise cell patterning, and higher throughput capabilities when compared to traditional tissue culture techniques. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. Limitations concerning nozzle extrusion, printing velocity, and construction resolution impede further progress in the field. The exploration and use of natural, synthetic, and hybrid biomaterials have exhibited considerable promise, providing mechanical tunability and cellular support. Furthermore, the layer-by-layer approach characteristic of 3D printing diminishes the risk of immunological graft rejection and addresses the ongoing issue of donor organ scarcity. This innovative technology also has the potential to enable personalized therapeutic approaches, thereby improving clinical outcomes and increasing patient satisfaction. Complexity in design and fabrication remains as an issue, since 3D printing is an optimal procedure for creating complex structures some intricate structures still need support structures that must be removed post-print. This removal process could be destructive or impractical in non-accessible zones, limiting functionality in the final construct. Vascularization in clinically relevant tissues is another challenge to create perfusable, hierarchical vascular networks within 3D scaffolds. Ince cells cannot survive more than 200–300 μm from blood supply due to diffusion limits. Three-dimensional printing can create microchannels that mimic the shape of vasculature, but these are passive conduits and therefore implanted scaffolds, or tissue suffer necrosis limiting the application of 3D printed biomaterials. However, ensuring biocompatibility and achieving successful integration of bioprinted constructs remains a significant challenge. Preserving cell viability within bio-ink formulations, achieving precise geometrical configurations, and standardizing bioprinting methodologies are critical for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the printed constructs. Moreover, establishing robust regulatory frameworks and comprehensive oversight is essential to guarantee the sustainable and ethical advancement of 3D printing in the healthcare area. 4D printing can create 2D flat structures that swell or shrink in response to physiological cues. These structures can fold and self-assemble into complex 3D structures creating a vascular system after implantation, also opens the possibility to create complex structures as physical stimuli responsive valves to control blood flow or nutrient delivery, something that a 3D printed structure cannot achieve. Printing a 2D or 3D structure with shape memory that can be folded, curled or bent is a more desirable approach. These structures fit better using a form-finding approach that of a predetermined 3D static shape or structure and thus, a more suitable application in the implantation surgery context. The form and function are embedded in the composition and stimulus response, not in shape, form or printing part alone also reducing print time, material and supports. In summary, while notable progress has been accomplished, 3D printing continues to advance rapidly. Its potential to transform manufacturing and healthcare is significant, heralding groundbreaking applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Ongoing research, innovation, and collaboration among scientific, regulatory, and clinical stakeholders will be crucial to fully realize the transformative potential of this technology. Future work will explore integrating our 3D printing for tissue engineering with design-encoding and pre-stress principles.

SLA Photo-curable polymer resins 50–100 µm High precision and smooth surfaces. Vulnerability to brittleness, reduced impact strength, and a limited lifespan due to the gradual degradation of physical properties over time. [ 20 21 DLP Photo-curable polymer resins 10–50 µm It offers higher printing speeds and is less influenced by oxygen inhibition than SLA. It requires the use of low-viscosity resins, which may limit the mechanical properties of the printed object. [ 22 23 Inkjet printing Polymers and hydrogels 50–300 µm Cost-effective, offers high resolution, enables rapid printing, and is compatible with a diverse range of materials. The materials used must be in liquid form, which leads to lower printing density and limits the ability to produce large or highly complex structures. [ 6 20 Poly-jet Photo-curable polymer resins 20 µm Smooth surfaces and intricate geometries, with support materials that can be easily removed. The range of materials is highly restricted, leading to higher costs. [ 24 25 26 FDM Polymers and their composites in filament form 100–150 µm User-friendly, environmentally sustainable, and relatively inexpensive, with high mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. It has a slower printing speed than SLA, provides lower dimensional accuracy, and requires high temperatures to function effectively. [ 27 28 3D Dispensing Polymers, hydrogels, ceramics, and their composites 100 µm Ability to process a broad spectrum of materials with varying viscosities, capable of printing bio-inks that contain living cells. It produces rough surface finishes and generally offers lower printing resolution. [ 29 30 Robocasting Dense ceramics and their composites 200 µm Allow the processing of highly dense ceramic pastes. It creates relatively rudimentary objects and faces difficulties in producing complex structures. [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 SLS Polymer powders, ceramic powders, and composite powders 50–100 µm Compatible with a wide range of materials and does not require the design of support structures. It requires high temperatures, rough surface finishes, and necessitates post-processing. [ 37 38 3D Bioprinting Hydrogels, biomolecules, and living cells 50–300 µm Allows the creation of 3D structures incorporating living substances. Expensive, involves complex operations, and requires a sterile environment for printing. [ 39 40 41 Abbreviations.
