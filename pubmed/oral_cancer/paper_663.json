Current therapeutic approaches, including pharmacological and surgical interventions, provide symptomatic relief but rarely address the underlying pathological mechanisms effectively. Acupotomy therapy, a minimally invasive technique integrating traditional Chinese medicine and modern surgical concepts, has shown promise in alleviating KOA symptoms. However, its mechanisms, particularly concerning chondrocyte pyroptosis, remain underexplored. This study investigates the role of acupotomy therapy in modulating chondrocyte pyroptosis via the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway in a rabbit KOA model. Methods Forty New Zealand rabbits were randomized into four groups: control, model, acupotomy, and drug-treated groups. A KOA model was induced via intra-articular injection of papain. Interventions included acupotomy therapy and oral celecoxib. Outcomes were assessed using behavioral scoring, micro-CT imaging, histological staining, serum inflammatory markers (ELISA), and the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated proteins (qPCR and Western blot). Results Acupotomy therapy significantly improved behavioral scores and reduced knee joint space narrowing. Histological analyses revealed improved cartilage integrity and decreased inflammatory markers. Expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD were downregulated in the acupotomy group compared to the model group. Conclusion This study highlights the therapeutic potential of acupotomy therapy in alleviating KOA symptoms and reducing chondrocyte pyroptosis by modulating the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for its application in KOA treatment and a foundation for further clinical exploration.

It predominantly affects the elderly population, significantly reducing their quality of life and overall health. 1 2 3 Current management approaches for KOA largely focus on conservative interventions, including the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, while surgical options such as total knee arthroplasty are typically reserved for advanced cases. 4 5 Acupotomy therapy, a technique rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, has been extensively applied in the treatment of joint disorders and has demonstrated promising clinical outcomes. 6 7 8 The pathogenesis of KOA is complex, involving mechanical stress, biochemical factors, and inflammatory responses. 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of acupotomy therapy in mitigating knee osteoarthritis through modulation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway. Using a rabbit KOA model, we will explore the effects of acupotomy therapy on inflammation, cartilage repair, and functional recovery, providing experimental evidence to support its clinical application. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms, this research seeks to contribute to the development of innovative and effective treatments for KOA. Materials and Methods Animals and Grouping Forty healthy 4-month-old New Zealand rabbits, weighing 2±0.2 kg, were purchased from Anhui Medical University Biological Co. Ltd. [Licence No. SYK (Anhui) 2019–011]. Due to the large number of rabbits required for this study, our institution’s laboratory facilities were insufficient to accommodate the necessary number of rabbit cages. Therefore, the procurement and care of the rabbits were outsourced to the Anhui Provincial Public Health Institute, with Researcher Yuan Hui responsible for their breeding and care. The animals were housed individually in cages under drugsled conditions with a room temperature of 23±2°C and a humidity of 60±10%. The rabbits underwent a 7-day acclimatization period before being randomly assigned to four groups: control, model, acupotomy, and drugs, with 10 animals in each group. The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Management and Animal Welfare of Anhui Provincial Public Health Institute (2024LS001). All animal acupotomys during the study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the “Guiding Opinions on the Kind Acupotomy of Laboratory Animals”. Main Reagents and Equipment RIPA cell lysate (P0013B), Trizol (15596018), paraformaldehyde (BL539A), PAGE gel procoagulant (T8090), TBST (Gooo-1L), PBS buffer (BL302), protein containment solution (PS108P), ECL ultrasensitive luminescence kit (BMU102-CN), and PAGE Gel Rapid Preparation Kit (PG211) were purchased from Beijing Solebaum Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining Kit, Fenghuang Solid Green Staining Solution (Anhui Tech Rabbit), RNA Rapid Extraction Kit (AC0205-B, Ciscojie Biotechnology Co., Ltd)., and ELISA Kit (EK0513-RB, Wuhan Doctoral Bioengineering Co., Ltd.) were also procured. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zhongsui Jinqiao), GAPDH antibody (60004-1-Ig), caspase-1 antibody (22915-1-AP), gephyrin D antibody (GSDMD, 20770-1-AP), NLRP3 antibody (19771-1-AP), and pyroptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) antibody (10500-1-AP) were purchased from Proteintech. Instruments and equipment used included a small acupotomy (Hanzhang brand, 0.4 mm × 30 mm, former Beijing Huaxia Needle and Knife Medical Instrument Factory, batch number 20160038), a desktop freezer (Ningbo Xinzhi Biotechnology Co., Ltd)., a PCR instrument (Model: BIO RAD 622BR64428), an electrophoresis instrument (Model: EPS300), an electrophoresis tank (WIX-miniBLOT4), a horizontal shaking machine (Model: SLK-R3000-S), a micro high-speed freezing centrifuge (SCILOGEX CF1524R, USA), an embedding machine (Model: YB-7LF), and a slicer (Model: RM2235). Model Establishment The control group did not undergo modeling. The model, acupotomy, and drugs groups received intra-articular injections of a 4% papain solution mixed with an L-cysteine solution (0.03 mol/L) in a 2:1 ratio. The mixture was injected into the rabbits’ left knee joints at a dose of 0.1 mL/kg on days 1, 4, and 7 over three consecutive weeks to induce the KOA model. Simultaneously, the left hind limb of each rabbit was immobilized using a softened resin bandage, maintaining the knee joint in a neutral position at 0° extension and the ankle joint dorsiflexed at 60°. 16 Intervention Treatment The control group was kept normally without intervention. The model group, the acupotomy group and the drugs group were all constructed with osteoarthritis model of the knee by beating medicine combined with fixation. After successful modelling, the model group had no intervention, and the acupotomy group received acupotomy acupotomy once a week for 3 times. Acupotomy intervention: rabbits were fixed on the iron frame in supine position, nodules and adhesion lesion points at the quadriceps tendon and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments of the knee joints of the left hind limb were touched and identified, and four points were selected each time and marked with surgical markers. The skin was prepared and sterilised in accordance with the routine procedure, and the acupotomy was used to make a straight incision along the longitudinal axis of the lower limb in the direction of the parallel incision, with the tip of the acupotomy passing through the skin and soft tissues, and when a sense of toughness was felt under the acupotomy, three to four lifting and insertion incisions were performed on the striated nodules. After the operation was completed, the acupotomy was withdrawn and local pressure was applied to stop bleeding. The drugs group was given oral celecoxib (Celebrex, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, National Drug Code: J20140072, 200 mg) at a dose of 18 mg/kg once a day for 3 weeks. Lequesne MG Behavioural Score The Modified Luckson Score MG Knee Index was used to look at localised pressure pain manifestations in the knee (0–3 points), joint mobility (0–3 points), joint swelling (0–2 points), and gait analysis (0–3 points). Higher total scores indicated more severe knee injury and poorer joint mobility function. The affected limbs of the rabbits were scored after modelling and the day after the end of the intervention. ELISA Assay After successful modelling and the end of the intervention, blood samples were collected from the marginal ear vein of rabbits in each group, and serum was obtained after centrifugation, and the concentrations of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β in serum were detected by ELISA kits, respectively. The specific operation was as follows: 50 μL of rabbit serum was added into a pre-coated 96-well plate and incubated for 60 min. After washing with washing buffer for 3 times, HRP-labelled antibody was added and incubated at 37°C for 60 min. After adding the termination solution, the OD value was measured at 450 nm, and the concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β were calculated from the standard curve. Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining and Safranin O-Fast Green Staining Hematoxylin-eosin staining(HE) and Safranin O-Fast Green Staining were used to observe the cartilage tissue and cell morphology of rabbit knee joints: paraffin sections were dewaxed and hydrated according to the routine process and then subjected to hematoxylin immersion staining (5 min), routinely differentiated, blued, dehydrated and then immersed in eosin solution (3 s), dehydrated, transparent and sealed to obtain HE-stained slices of rabbit knee joints; Paraffin sections were stained with Weigert’s solution for 5 minutes, followed by washing with distilled water. The sections were then differentiated using an acidic differentiation solution, washed again, and stained with Fast Green solution for 5–10 minutes. After rinsing with distilled water, the sections were washed with a weak acid solution to remove any residual Fast Green. The sections were then stained with Safranin O solution for 5–10 minutes. Following staining, the sections were dehydrated in the usual manner, cleared with xylene, and mounted with neutral balsam to create Safranin O-Fast Green stained sections of rabbit knee joints. The stained sections were then observed under a light microscope. Real-Time Fluorescence Quantitative PCR The total RNA was extracted by Trizol method after weighing 100 mg of cartilage tissue and cutting it into pieces. cDNA was reverse transcribed from the total RNA using a reverse transcription kit and used as a template for PCR amplification. GAPDH was used as an internal reference gene, and the relative expression of each group of samples was calculated using the 2- ΔΔ Table 1 Table 1 Target Genes and Primer Sequences for qRT-PCR Gene Upstream Primer (5′→3′) Downstream Primer (3′→5′) Amplication GAPDH AGACACGATGGTGAAGGTCG TGCCGTGGGTGGAATCATAC 164 NLRP3 GTGTCAAGACCACAGCTCCA GTAATTGGGACCATCGGCCT 147 Caspase-1 GCCTGGTCTTGTGATGTGGA TGATAGCACTCTTGGCTTCGT 159 ASC GCAACTGCGAGAAGGCTATG GTGAGCTCCAAGCCATACGA 247 GSDMD CGATCTCATTCCGGTGGACAG GGTTTCCAGAACCTTGAGCTTG 269 Western Blot NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle-associated protein expression in cartilage tissues was detected by Western blot. About 100mg of cartilage tissue samples were weighed and tissue lysis was performed by adding 600µL of RIPA lysate to extract the total protein. After loading, electrophoresis and protein transfer of the protein samples, the samples were closed at room temperature for 2 hours on a shaker using Western Closure Solution with 5% skimmed milk powder. Primary antibody was added for overnight incubation at 4°C. The secondary antibody was added and incubated the following day. Protein signals were detected using an ECL luminescence kit and the grey values of the film strips were quantified using Image-J software. Statistical Analysis All data analyses were performed using R software (version 4.0.1; https://www.r-project.org/ t Results Comparison of Lequesne MG Behavioural Scores in Rabbits in Each Group The Lequesne MG behavioral scores, an established indicator of knee joint mobility, demonstrated significant differences among the experimental groups.

This procedure induced significant cartilage degeneration and joint damage, as confirmed by gross morphological observations, which revealed severe cartilage surface erosion and irregularity ( Figure 1A B Figure 1C Figure 1D P < 0.05 Figure 1 ( A B C D HE and Safranin O-Fast Green Staining of Rabbit Knee Joints in Each Group Histological analysis revealed significant differences in cartilage morphology across the experimental groups. The control group exhibited a well-preserved cartilage structure with evenly distributed chondrocytes, clear nuclei, and normal morphology. In contrast, the model group showed substantial cartilage degradation, characterized by a reduced number of chondrocytes, scattered arrangement, wrinkled or ruptured nuclei, and thinning of the cartilage layer. Both acupotomy and Drugs treatments improved cartilage structure, as evidenced by smoother cartilage surfaces, clearer structural layers, and an increased number of chondrocytes with distinct nuclei. Notably, the acupotomy group demonstrated more pronounced improvements compared to the Drugs group ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Histopathological analysis of rabbit knee joints.

( A B p < 0.05 p < 0.01 p < 0.001 Abbreviations Discussion In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is classified under the category of “Bi Syndrome”, specifically manifesting as “knee Bi” or “tendon Bi”. TCM views knee pain not merely as a localized symptom but as an external manifestation of systemic dysfunction, involving internal organ imbalance and impaired circulation of qi and blood. 17 18 19 Acupotomy therapy is an acupotomy method that combines the principles of traditional Chinese acupuncture with modern Western anatomy. Through its unique dual action of needles and blades, it effectively loosens and separates adhesions and scar tissue, thereby alleviating pain caused by adhesions. 20 21 22 KOA is characterized by structural changes throughout the knee joint, including progressive degeneration of articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis, osteophyte formation, inflammation, abnormal angiogenesis, and inward growth of subchondral bone nerves. 1 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 The results of this experiment indicated that acupotomy therapy alleviates nodules and adhesions around the joint, reduces abnormal traction of quadriceps muscle fibers as well as the patella, and regulates stress distribution around the joint. This therapy can significantly improve knee joint function and reduce pain. After acupotomy, the number of osteophytes on the surface of the rabbit knee joint decreased; the cartilage layer was relatively smooth and well-structured, with an increased number of chondrocytes arranged in an orderly manner, and serum inflammatory factor levels also decreased. The expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, and GSDMD mRNA and proteins in cartilage tissue were significantly downregulated, indicating that the mechanical cutting and loosening effects of the acupotomy on striated nodular lesions convert mechanical energy into thermal energy, which accelerates blood circulation and the metabolism of inflammatory substances, reduces local knee joint pain, and downregulates the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes to inhibit chondrocyte pyroptosis, thereby achieving effective therapeutic outcomes. Conclusion In summary, acupotomy release therapy significantly improved motor symptoms and behavioral abilities in KOA model rabbits by downregulating the expression of inflammasome-associated proteins, attenuating the inflammatory response, and reducing chondrocyte pathological damage. Acupotomy therapy can repair cartilage damage by mediating chondrocyte pyroptosis and reducing the release of inflammatory mediators in the knee joint. This finding provides a new theoretical basis and therapeutic approach for treating KOA with acupotomy therapy. Given the complex pathological mechanisms of KOA, future studies should explore combining acupotomy therapy with other therapeutic strategies to achieve a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of KOA acupotomy.
