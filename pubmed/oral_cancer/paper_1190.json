However, its clinical management is severely hindered by three interconnected challenges that limit long-term survival: treatment resistance, metastatic dissemination, and immunological evasion. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, is emerging as a novel strategy to overcome these obstacles. Furthermore, it demonstrates significant potential in inhibiting tumor metastasis and modifying the anti-tumor immune microenvironment, which provides a novel approach to address the core dilemma of breast cancer. Natural products have emerged as significant sources of ferroptosis inducers owing to their distinctive chemical variety, multi-target regulatory capabilities, and acceptable safety profile. Data increasingly indicates that several natural compounds can function as effective inducers or sensitizers of ferroptosis cell death. This review provides a thorough evaluation of current progress in harnessing natural ingredients to trigger ferroptosis for breast cancer treatment. It also elucidates the fundamental molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, it encapsulates therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models. Ultimately, it rigorously evaluates existing constraints and delineates potential and barriers for clinical translation. breast cancer ferroptosis natural compounds drug resistance ferroptosis inducers phytochemicals lead compounds Guizhou Provincial Basic Research Program (Natural Science) QKH-JC-ZK [2021] ZD018 This work was funded by the Guizhou Provincial Basic Research Program (Natural Science), grant number QKH-JC-ZK [2021] ZD018. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Breast cancer represents a major global health burden, continuing to be the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Ferroptosis is a controlled cell death mechanism characterized by iron buildup and lipid peroxidation, functioning independently of the classical apoptotic pathway [ 8 9 + 10 11 Natural products exhibit exceptional structural diversity and broad biological activity, making them a significant resource for anticancer drug discovery [ 12 13 14 15 Although natural-product-based ferroptosis modulators exhibit intriguing promise in breast cancer treatment, existing research is predominantly confined to in vitro cell models and lacks comprehensive comparative data on sensitivity among various molecular subtypes [ 16 17 18 Investigating natural compounds that target the ferroptosis pathway has become as a crucial avenue for overcoming challenges in breast cancer treatment. This study summarizes recent advancements in modulating ferroptosis for breast cancer therapy. Specifically, it focuses on the role of natural products in this process. It emphasizes the fundamental molecular mechanisms. It aggregates preclinical research and assesses treatment efficacy in experimental models. Additionally, it offers a theoretical foundation for subsequent study and pharmaceutical innovation. Future research in this field is anticipated to focus on multiple areas. A key research priority is the development of biomarker-driven patient stratification systems to enable precision therapy. In parallel, it is essential to enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds through medicinal chemistry optimization and nanodelivery technologies. Equally important is a deeper analysis of the fundamental interplay between the tumor microenvironment and ferroptosis regulatory networks. It is essential to elucidate the interaction between metabolic reprogramming, immunological regulation, and ferroptosis. Furthermore, establishing standardized methodologies for the detection of ferroptosis is essential. It is also critical to develop dynamic monitoring techniques for ferroptosis-related biomarkers to facilitate clinical translation. These systematic investigations will provide a solid scientific basis and translational framework for novel therapeutic options targeting breast cancer. 2. The Molecular Regulatory Network of Ferroptosis Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death that is driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. The intricate regulatory network centers on three fundamental pillars, namely iron metabolism, lipid metabolism, and the antioxidant system [ 19 Figure 1 2.1. Regulation of Iron Metabolism The onset of ferroptosis fundamentally contingent upon the abnormal enlargement the cellular labile iron pool (LIP). This enlargement results from impaired iron homeostasis, in which ferritinophagy is the primary pathway. During ferritinophagy, the adaptor protein Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 4 (NCOA4) is meticulously regulated by upstream signals, including Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase; in response to cellular stress, NCOA4 facilitates the lysosomal breakdown of ferritin complexes, liberating substantial quantities of catalytically active Fe 2+ 20 21 22 2+ 23 24 2.2. Lipid Peroxidation At the molecular level, ferroptosis is defined by an oxidation cascade that specifically affects polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in membrane phospholipids. The sensitivity of cells to ferroptosis correlates directly proportional to the quantity of oxidizable PUFAs in the membrane. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) functions as an initiating and specificity-determining enzyme by preferentially activating long-chain PUFAs such as arachidonic acid (AA) and adrenic acid (AdA) and facilitating their esterification into membrane phospholipids, thereby supplying specific substrates for subsequent lipid peroxidation [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 2.3. Antioxidant Defense System To counter ferroptotic stress, cells have developed a multifaceted antioxidant system composed of parallel and partially redundant processes. X4-dependent core pathway: The system cystine/glutamate antiporter (Xc − − 31 32 33 34 X4-independent parallel pathways: Supplementary routes augment resilience. The Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1(FSP1)–Coenzyme Q10(CoQ10) pathway converts coenzyme Q10 to ubiquinol (CoQH 2 35 36 37 38 19 39 Upstream transcriptional regulation: Expression of these defenses is governed by a complicated transcriptional network. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a principal regulator of oxidative-stress responses, enhances the expression of SLC7A11, GPX4, and ferritin, therefore inhibiting ferroptosis [ 40 41 42 43 44 Ferroptosis is regulated by a dynamic network that equilibrates iron, lipid, and antioxidant systems balance each other. Cancer cells frequently modify or enhance their antioxidant defenses to endure ferroptosis; this adaptive metabolic reprogramming generates particular vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically. 3. The Intrinsic Link Between Ferroptosis and Breast Cancer Therapy 3.1. Intrinsic Mechanisms Underlying Ferroptosis Sensitivity in Breast Cancer Cells As a general principle in oncology, metabolic remodeling in cancer cells heightens reliance on iron and lipids, hence creating a foundational susceptibility to ferroptosis [ 45 46 47 48 49 Figure 2 To support rapid proliferation, breast cancer cells typically demonstrate iron dependency via regulating iron metabolism proteins. Yu et al. indicated that in hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α enhances the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), leading to elevated intracellular iron levels, the activation of ferroptosis, and the reversal of doxorubicin resistance [ 50 51 52 53 53 54 55 56 3.2. Differences in Ferroptosis Sensitivity Across Molecular Subtypes of Breast Cancer Various molecular subtypes of breast cancer have varying sensitivity to ferroptosis, attributable to distinct driver gene mutations, gene expression profiles, and reliance on core signaling pathways [ 15 48 57 TNBC typically demonstrates increased inherent sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers [ 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 Conversely, hormone-receptor-positive (HR-positive) luminal tumors typically exhibit heightened resistance to ferroptosis. This resistance is partially due to the subtype’s dependence on estrogen signaling and cell-cycle control pathways. For example, Cui et al. revealed that Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors induce ferroptosis in Luminal A breast cancer cells by inhibiting SLC7A11. Nonetheless, the cells develop tolerance by compensatory upregulation of SLC7A11 [ 67 The ferroptosis sensitivity of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer is regulated by the HER2 signaling pathway and is generally low. Activation of HER2 initiates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which promotes cell proliferation and concurrently bolsters lipid-oxidation defenses, thus inhibiting ferroptosis [ 68 69 70 71 Although lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) are the ultimate biochemical executioners of ferroptosis, their direct detection is highly challenging in breast cancer subtypes with intrinsic resistance to this cell death pathway [ 72 54 73 74 Table 1 3.3. Genetic Regulatory Network of Ferroptosis Sensitivity The vulnerability of breast cancer cells to ferroptosis is influenced by subtype-specific signaling pathways as well as a meticulously regulated network focused on essential genes such as p53, Breast Cancer vulnerability Gene 1 (BRCA1) and the PI3K–protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. The functional condition of these nodes directly determines how readily a cell undergoes ferroptosis. In cells with wild-type p53, the protein mostly induces ferroptosis by directly inhibiting the transcription of SLC7A11, the essential subunit of the System Xc − 77 78 79 44 80 Constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, commonly observed in breast cancer, constitutes a major mechanism that suppresses ferroptosis. Activated AKT phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), therefore alleviating the regulation of the transcription factor NRF2. Nuclear translocation of NRF2 subsequently induces the production of an antioxidant gene program, including GPX4, which jointly mitigates ferroptotic cell death [ 81 82 83 Mutational inactivation of BRCA1 or BRCA2, characteristic lesions in hereditary breast cancer, is also closely associated with the regulation of ferroptosis. Lei et al. elucidated a multifaceted function of BRCA1; its loss causes cancer cells more susceptible to concurrent inhibition of GPX4 and Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) [ 84 85 3.4. Strategies for Using Ferroptosis Induction to Overcome Drug Resistance in Breast Cancer Inducing ferroptosis is a significant method for addressing drug resistance in breast cancer, as it operates through a molecular mechanism that is fundamentally distinct from classical apoptosis [ 86 87 88 89 90 The anticancer efficacy of the traditional chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is somewhat facilitated by ferroptosis, resulting from the interplay of impaired iron metabolism and reactive oxygen species generation [ 91 92 93 94 95 The stimulation of ferroptosis holds significant potential for surmounting resistance to targeted therapy. Hua et al. discovered that trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells can be resensitized by the inhibition of SLC7A11-mediated cystine metabolism [ 96 97 98 99 84 100 101 102 103 Furthermore, ferroptosis is now understood to operate as a form of immunogenic cell-death (ICD) in the broader context of cancer immunology, transforming an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into an immune-active state [ 104 105 3 106 107 108 4. Natural Products as Modulators of Ferroptosis in Breast Cancer As a distinct form of non-apoptotic regulated cell death, ferroptosis offers a novel strategy to overcome key challenges in breast cancer, as its molecular mechanism can effectively bypass obstacles such as therapeutic resistance and immune evasion. The complex molecular network governing ferroptosis, in turn, provides a wealth of molecular targets for precision therapeutic intervention. Among various strategies, natural products have garnered significant attention as a class of highly promising modulators. Their value lies primarily in their role as a source of established drug lead compounds, often possessing favorable safety profiles and inherent multi-target regulatory capabilities. Therefore, this chapter will systematically review the natural compounds reported to date that can induce or sensitize breast cancer cells to ferroptosis. However, before delving into the specific biological activities of these various natural compounds, it is crucial to first acknowledge a prevalent and critical challenge: their common pharmacokinetic deficiencies. Many promising natural products, including highly-studied molecules like curcumin and resveratrol, are hampered by issues such as low aqueous solubility, poor intestinal absorption, and rapid in vivo metabolism. These factors collectively lead to low bioavailability, making it extremely difficult to achieve and maintain effective therapeutic concentrations at the tumor site. Therefore, understanding this fundamental bottleneck is essential for objectively evaluating the preclinical data discussed hereafter and for recognizing the necessity of developing optimization strategies, such as advanced delivery systems. 4.1. Polyphenols The following discussion focuses on Polyphenols Table 2 Figure 3 Polyphenolic compounds comprise aromatic rings abundant in phenolic hydroxyl groups. This configuration allows for the chelation of Fe 2+ 109 110 111 112 Quercetin, a representative flavonoid, induces ferritinophagy, thus initiating ferroptosis. An et al. initially demonstrated that quercetin facilitates the nuclear translocation of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB). This event triggers lysosomal breakdown of ferritin, liberates stored iron, and induces ferroptosis in breast cancer cells [ 113 114 115 Resveratrol provides molecular evidence for disruption of the GPX4 pathway. Zhang et al. revealed that resveratrol attracts Neural Precursor Cell Expressed Developmentally Down-Regulated Protein 4-Like (NEDD4L) in TNBC cells. This E3 ubiquitin ligase facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of GPX4, promotes ferroptosis, and suppresses tumor development in vivo [ 116 116 81 Polyphenols additionally regulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial activity. Formononetin prompts ferroptosis in TNBC cells by reprogramming lipid metabolism via the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 (SREBP1)/Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) pathway [ 117 118 119 120 Curcumin exemplifies multi-target synergy in the activation of ferroptosis [ 121 122 123 2+ 124 125 Numerous polyphenols demonstrate robust effectiveness in TNBC models, implying an inherent susceptibility to ferroptosis. Evidence indicates two primary factors: first, certain TNBC cells have elevated amounts of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), the enzyme responsible for esterifying polyunsaturated fatty acids into membranes—an essential precursor for ferroptosis. Second, the dependence of TNBC on specific metabolic pathways, such as cystine metabolism, renders it more susceptible to drugs that inhibit GSH synthesis [ 112 126 Besides serving as individual active molecules, polyphenols can function as chemosensitizers that mitigate resistance. Numerous studies indicate that curcumin enhances the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to standard chemotherapeutics like cisplatin or doxorubicin by cooperatively triggering ferroptosis [ 127 128 129 Nonetheless, the clinical application of polyphenols encounters substantial obstacles, with generally inadequate bioavailability as the primary bottleneck. This limitation arises primarily from inherently low aqueous solubility and pronounced first-pass hepatic–intestinal metabolism following oral administration, which includes rapid enzyme-mediated conjugation activities (e.g., glucuronidation and sulfation) in the gastrointestinal tract and liver [ 130 131 132 133 134 biomolecules-15-01308-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Polyphenolic compounds that induce ferroptosis in breast cancer.

[ 120 Resveratrol Strong Polyphenol (stilbene) TNBC cells and xenografts Induces ferroptosis through NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of GPX4, leading to lipid peroxide accumulation. [ 116 Oxyresveratrol Strong Polyphenol (stilbene) Breast cancer cells Suppresses the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway, downregulates GPX4, and thereby provokes ferroptosis. [ 81 Formononetin Strong Isoflavone TNBC cells Inhibits the mTORC1/SREBP1/SCD1 axis, reduces MUFA biosynthesis, and facilitates ferroptosis via augmented lipid peroxidation. [ 117 Rosmarinic acid Strong Phenolic acid TNBC cells Promotes mitochondrial fission and consequently drives ferroptosis through intensified lipid oxidative damage. [ 118 Curcumin Strong Curcuminoid MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) Orchestrates ferroptosis by repressing the p53/SLC7A11 axis to deplete GSH and inactivate GPX4, while upregulating HO-1 to enlarge the labile iron pool and enhancing SLC1A5-dependent metabolic stress. [ 121 4.2. Terpenoids and Their Derivatives This section reviews the role of Terpenoids Table 3 Figure 4 Terpenoids are structurally varied natural compounds, and their ability to cause ferroptosis in breast cancer frequently stems from electrophilic moieties within the framework. Specifically, α,β-unsaturated carbonyls function as Michael acceptors that covalently modify catalytic cysteines in targets such as GPX4, resulting irreversible inactivation and therefore facilitating ferroptosis [ 136 137 138 Artemisinin and its derivatives are the most well researched examples; its distinctive endoperoxide bridge (-O-O-) confers antitumor activity against neoplastic cells at the molecular level. In Fe 2 139 140 2+ 141 142 143 Subsequent research indicates that artemisinin derivatives operate via multiple apoptotic pathways. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) increases radiosensitivity of breast-cancer cells by targeting circRNA hsa_circ_0001610 to regulate ferroptosis-related signaling [ 144 145 140 Mechanistic studies on additional terpenoids within the GSH/GPX4 regulation axis highlight complex regulatory mechanisms. A retrospective clinical study noted enhanced survival in breast cancer patients treated with the traditional Chinese medicine Danshen; subsequent research identified dihydroisotanshinone I as an inducer of ferroptosis and apoptosis. At the molecular level, tanshinone IIA controls KDM1A and thereby influencing PIAS4-mediated SUMOylation of SLC7A11, resulting in destabilization and degradation of SLC7A11 [ 146 135 147 Terpenoids utilize various ways to downregulate GPX4 through post-translational changes. Anomanolide C drives GPX4 into an autophagy-dependent degradation route via ubiquitination [ 148 149 150 151 The benefits of terpenoid molecules arise from the interaction of their chemical properties and the synergistic mechanisms they facilitate. Hinokitiol, for instance, forms compounds with iron and functions directly as an iron ionophore/carrier, thus circumventing intricate upstream regulatory checkpoints [ 152 153 154 155 156 157 biomolecules-15-01308-t003_Table 3 Table 3 Terpenoids and their derivatives that induce ferroptosis in breast cancer.

[ 158 Tanshinone IIA Strong Abietane diterpenoid Breast cancer cells Destabilizes SLC7A11 through KDM1A–PIAS4–mediated SUMOylation, promoting ferroptosis. [ 146 Curcumol derivative HCL-23 Strong Sesquiterpenoid TNBC Induces HO-1-dependent ferroptosis and apoptosis, inhibiting malignant phenotype.

[ 147 Anomanolide C Strong Sesquiterpene lactone TNBC Triggers autophagy-dependent ferroptosis by promoting GPX4 ubiquitination, suppressing progression and metastasis. [ 148 Taraxerol Strong Triterpenoid Breast cancer cells Inhibits Nrf2 transcriptional activity, facilitating MIB2-mediated GPX4 ubiquitination and ferroptosis.

[ 152 Oridonin Strong Diterpenoid Breast cancer cells Potentiates RSL3-induced ferroptosis via JNK/Nrf2/HO-1 oxidative-stress signaling. [ 153 4.3. Saponins This chapter examines the potential of Saponins Table 4 Figure 5 Saponins, distinguished by their amphiphilic architectures and varied bioactivities, have surfaced as possible inducers of ferroptosis in breast cancer research [ 159 160 Albiziabioside A exemplifies the multifunctionality of saponins. A chemically optimized derivative developed by Huang et al. functions as a p53 activator while concurrently triggering caspase-dependent apoptosis and ferroptosis in breast cancer cells [ 161 162 While comprehensive data on the ginsenoside family and ferroptosis in breast cancer are scarce, research on particular fractions or individual saponins has shown potential mechanisms. Kim et al. demonstrated that red-ginseng polysaccharides extracted from Panax ginseng down-regulate GPX4 and cause ferroptosis in breast cancer cells [ 163 164 Multi-pathway control by saponins has been validated in many compounds that influence fundamental ferroptosis pathways. Yan and Xuan indicated that Paris saponin VII suppresses the NRF2/GPX4 pathway [ 165 166 167 Two primary characteristics encapsulate the function of saponins in promoting ferroptosis in breast cancer. Their synergistic ability to augment other therapy is paramount. Their capacity to function through various mechanisms or in conjunction with other cell-death pathways. For instance, Li et al. demonstrated that escin causes ferroptosis while synergizing with cisplatin to produce a heightened anticancer effect [ 168 159 160 biomolecules-15-01308-t004_Table 4 Table 4 Saponins that induce ferroptosis in breast cancer. Compound Strength of Chemical Class Model/ Effect Reference Formosanin C Strong Steroidal saponin MDA-MB-231 (TNBC), MCF-7 (Luminal A) Induces ferroptosis characterized by elevated ROS and MDA, depletion of glutathione, and increased intracellular ferrous iron.

[ 168 Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) Strong Steroidal saponin Breast cancer cell lines Accelerates ferroptosis by repressing RUNX2 and modulating the AGE-RAGE pathway, thereby amplifying oxidative stress. [ 164 4.4. Alkaloids This section highlights key members of the Alkaloids Table 5 Figure 6 Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic natural compounds characterized by varied chemical structures and broad biological activity, rendering them crucial frameworks in medication development [ 169 Recent studies have concentrated on employing alkaloids as organic ligands to develop medicinal metal complexes. Wang et al. developed a cycloplatinated compound (Pt-3) derived from an isoquinoline alkaloid, demonstrating superior anticancer efficacy compared to cisplatin in TNBC cells; the mechanism entails the activation of ferritinophagy and the induction of ferritinophagy-dependent ferroptosis [ 170 171 Besides synthetic derivatives, certain unaltered natural alkaloids directly trigger ferroptosis. Yi et al. indicated that peiminine—an active constituent of Fritillaria—induces ferroptosis via the NRF2 pathway and inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells [ 172 173 These investigations elucidate two primary mechanisms by which alkaloids influence ferroptosis in breast cancer. Initially, alkaloid-based derivatives, functioning as ligands in metal complexes, can induce ferroptosis while concurrently engaging additional processes, including immunological activation. Secondly, natural alkaloids can directly induce ferroptosis by modulating additional critical signaling pathways, including NRF2. The combination of structural modifiability and intrinsic ferroptosis-inducing activity positions alkaloids render them intriguing lead molecules for developing ferroptosis-targeted therapies against breast cancer. biomolecules-15-01308-t005_Table 5 Table 5 Alkaloids that induce ferroptosis in breast cancer.

[ 172 Indirubin Strong Indole alkaloid 4T1 murine breast cancer (in vitro and in vivo) Suppresses tumor growth by inducing ferroptosis marked by GPX4 downregulation and lipid peroxidation. [ 173 4.5. Other Chemical Classes A variety of Other Chemical Classes have demonstrated the ability to trigger ferroptosis in breast cancer. Table 6 Figure 7 In addition to the aforementioned categories, polysaccharides, quinones, and sterols also play a role in modulating ferroptosis in breast cancer, providing diverse molecular entities for targeted pharmacological development. Growing data indicates that, alongside their immunomodulatory effects, macromolecular polysaccharides can affect ferroptosis. Wang et al. initially showed that Lycium barbarum 174 Tetrastigma hemsleyanum 92 Quinones, capable of inducing lipid peroxidation through redox cycling, are pivotal in ferroptosis regulation [ 175 176 177 178 179 180 Sterols, especially cardiac glycosides, are transitioning from cardiovascular to anticancer research [ 181 182 35 183 184 These unique natural-product frameworks stimulate innovative pharmaceutical innovations. Using bufalin as a chemical backbone, researchers created a photo-activated methylene-blue-bufalin conjugate. Wu et al. demonstrated that this compound selectively targets GPX4 for degradation and, under light exposure, effectively triggers ferroptosis-like death in breast-cancer cells [ 185 The ferroptosis findings for these quinone compounds mostly originate from non–breast cancer tumor models; nonetheless, their mechanisms of action demonstrate significant translational potential in breast cancer and may support the development of new targeted therapies. biomolecules-15-01308-t006_Table 6 Table 6 Other chemical classes that induce ferroptosis in breast cancer.

[ 35 Erigoster B Strong Sterol Breast cancer cells Targets DECR1 to reprogram phosphatidylcholine/arachidonic acid metabolism and enforce ferroptosis. [ 184 Ferroptosis findings for these quinone compounds mostly originate from non-breast cancer tumor models; nonetheless, their mechanisms of action demonstrate significant translational potential in breast cancer and may support the development of novel targeted therapies. 5. Conclusion, Current Limitations, and Future Perspectives 5.1. A Critical Review of Gaps and Limitations A core challenge of natural products lies in their inherent multi-target pharmacological properties. While this characteristic may offer potential advantages for synergistic therapy, it also introduces complexity to the traditional, single-target-based drug discovery paradigm [ 169 187 188 189 190 125 191 Beyond mechanistic uncertainty, the clinical development of natural products is fundamentally challenged by their poor pharmacokinetic properties. Many lead compounds exhibit extremely low oral bioavailability, preventing them from reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in the blood. For example, although curcumin displays potent anticancer activity in vitro, its clinical application is severely limited by a bioavailability often reported to be less than 1%, primarily due to extensive first-pass metabolism [ 192 193 194 195 In comprehensively evaluating the current literature on natural product-induced ferroptosis, maintaining a critical perspective on the methodological rigor of preclinical studies is essential. Although existing research has provided valuable insights, some studies, particularly early exploratory work, may have limitations in data presentation and statistical analysis. For instance, many conclusions relying on Western blots sometimes lack sufficient quantification and an adequate number of biological replicates to support their reliability. Similarly, in some animal studies, small sample sizes (n-numbers) may limit their statistical power, making the generalizability of the conclusions questionable. Moreover, many findings are highly dependent on a few specific cancer cell lines, which may not fully reflect the high degree of heterogeneity in breast cancer among actual patients. Therefore, future research must, while pursuing mechanistic innovation, place greater emphasis on adhering to rigorous experimental standards to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results, thereby laying a more solid foundation for future clinical translation. It is important to note that, to date, no clinical trials have been specifically designed to evaluate natural products as ferroptosis modulators in breast cancer, and the current body of evidence remains exclusively at the preclinical stage. The reliance on oversimplified preclinical models is another major obstacle hindering translational success. The vast majority of studies are conducted on two-dimensional (2D) cell monolayers, a system that fails to replicate the complex three-dimensional architecture and cell–cell interactions of solid tumors, nor can it accurately assess drug resistance, phenomena better captured by 3D spheroids and organoid systems [ 196 197 198 21 47 This translational gap is further exacerbated by the lack of validated biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment monitoring. Current development of predictive biomarkers has mainly produced computational gene signatures (such as FERscore) based on retrospective dataset analysis, but they lack the prospective clinical validation necessary to guide patient selection [ 199 200 201 71 202 However, the most fundamental limitation of targeting ferroptosis lies in the potential for on-target toxicity in non-cancer tissues. This risk stems from the fact that ferroptosis is a basic physiological process, not a tumor-specific pathway; therefore, the same mechanisms activated in cancer cells can also disrupt homeostasis in normal tissues. The heart is one of the most vulnerable high-risk organs, as its energy metabolism is highly dependent on mitochondrial iron–sulfur clusters, the destabilization of which directly leads to functional impairment. This vulnerability is exemplified by the clinical cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin: a study by Liao et al. showed that the drug triggers ferroptosis by promoting lipid peroxidation in cardiomyocytes [ 203 204 205 206 31 207 5.2. Future Perspectives and Strategies to Surmount Obstacles Medicinal chemistry optimization is foundational for converting promising natural products into viable clinical candidates. The strategy often begins with identifying natural product scaffolds that modulate ferroptosis and then systematically modifying them to develop potent and selective inhibitors, with a primary focus on the key regulator, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) [ 137 208 209 210 211 212 Innovative drug delivery technologies are crucial for translating the potential of natural ferroptosis inducers into clinical reality, with developments extending far beyond traditional liposomes and polymer micelles. Recent advances have focused on sophisticated biomimetic nanoplatforms, which are camouflaged with membranes derived from macrophages or cancer cells to evade immune clearance and achieve superior tumor-homing capabilities [ 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 Combination tactics based on mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the drug resistance that frequently limits the efficacy of single-agent therapies [ 137 221 90 222 Finally, future research must shift its focus from in vitro cell experiments to more clinically relevant models to bridge the current translational gap. A priority research direction is the validation of promising natural products in appropriate preclinical animal models. For example, Tanshinone IIA, which has shown potent ferroptosis-inducing activity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, could be administered via tail vein injection in mice bearing 4T1 orthotopic tumors [ 15 223 102 54 224 Acknowledgments The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Guizhou Provincial Basic Research Program (Natural Science) (Grant No. QKH-JC-ZK ZD018).

This figure illustrates the three core pillars of ferroptosis regulation: the pro-ferroptotic processes of iron metabolism and lipid peroxidation, which are counteracted by a multi-layered antioxidant defense system centered on the GPX4, FSP1, and GCH1 pathways (by figdraw.com Figure 2 Molecular mechanisms regulating ferroptosis in breast cancer. Figure depicts how ferroptosis is regulated in breast cancer. Key subtype-specific pathways, including those driven by ZEB1, ERα, and HER2, directly control core ferroptotic processes to create unique therapeutic vulnerabilities (by figdraw.com Figure 3 Chemical structures of representative polyphenolic compounds that modulate ferroptosis.
