Heart attacks and strokes often lead to mortal outcomes, the main underlying issue being thrombus generation, which can block vessels and hamper the normal blood flow. 1 2 3 4,5 6,7 Icariin (ICA) ( Fig. 1A Epimedium Epimedium 8 via 9,10 11 12 Fig. 1 (A) Chemical structure of icariin (ICA). (B) Excitation and emission spectra of NSC-dots in the absence (solid line) and presence (dotted line) of 20 μg mL −1 λ λ The improvement of ICA's chemical instability and/or poor bioavailability has been a workable way to enhance therapeutic outcomes. The utilization of nanotechnology via 13–17 To the best of our knowledge, no previous fluorometric analytical method has been reported for ICA, although HPLC in tandem with a UV 18–20 21,22 23,24 25 23 Carbon dots, or CDs, have attracted a lot of interest lately because of their excellent photostability, ease of synthesis, low cost, and exceptional biocompatibility. These materials range in size from 2 to 10 nm, making them a kind of nanomaterial. Many studies have focused on surface functionalization or heteroatom doping to improve the CDs' optical, chemical, and electrical properties. 26,27 27–30 26,31 26,27,32 On the other hand, metal-based QDs ( e.g. 33 34 In contrast, CDs offer a slight reduction in quantum yield in exchange for exceptional biocompatibility, low toxicity, and sustainability. Composed mainly of carbon, they avoid heavy-metal hazards while providing safer, greener, and regulatory-compliant alternatives for biomedical use. 35 Leveraging their unique photophysical properties, carbon dots (CDs) are gaining considerable attention as a superior alternative to traditional organic fluorophores. 36 In addition to developing this analytical procedure, we successfully used the system to quantify ICA in a novel whey protein-based nano-formulation. This formulation enhanced ICA's bioavailability and was designed to explore its potential as a safer, prophylactic alternative to traditional anticoagulant drugs. The anticoagulant activity was further validated through a molecular docking study. This work's primary contribution lies in its dual focus: introducing a simple and sensitive analytical procedure for ICA using quantum dots while also underscoring the crucial, previously unexplored role of ICA as an anticoagulant nutraceutical. 2 Experimental 2.1. Chemicals and reagents Icariin (ICA) (purity >98% ± 1%) was purchased from Medchemexpress, USA, while the whey protein concentrate from bovine milk was bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Solvents and reagents, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, acetonitrile, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, boric acid, and glacial acetic acid, were mostly supplied by the El Nasr Chemical Company, Cairo, Egypt. l 2.2. Animals Eight Wistar male rats weighing between 200 and 260 grams were provided for our experimental study by the Laboratory Animal Centre of the Alexandria University Faculty of Pharmacy. The rats were kept in an acoustically regulated metabolic cage with a temperature and relative humidity maintained at 25 ± 2 °C and 45–55% rh, respectively, before the start point of the experiment. Throughout the study, they were supplied with standard laboratory fare and water. The animal trials were approved by the Faculty of Pharmacy's Care and Use of Animals Committee (Ethical Approval Number: AU0620247293242). 2.3. Instruments and software Spectrofluorometric readings were taken using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, USA; model: G9800A). The synthesis of the QDs was carried out using a domestic microwave oven (Daewoo model: KOG-1B5H). QDs were characterized using a Shimadzu UV-vis light spectrophotometer (USA model 1800), an Agilent Cary 360 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and a Thermo Scientific K Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer to assess their chemical composition. Furthermore, the crystalline structure of the synthesized NSC dots was investigated by a TEM-1400 plus electron microscope. The in vitro in silico 2.4. Microwave-driven quantum dots synthesis A mass of 0.91 g of anhydrous citric acid (4.75 mmol) and 0.5 g l 2.4.1. Purification protocol Following the hydrothermal synthesis and neutralization steps, the crude NSC dots solution underwent purification using a dialysis membrane with 1000 Da molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) for 48 hours against deionized water. The dialysis process was conducted with regular water changes every 8 hours to ensure complete removal of the unreacted precursors, salt byproducts, and other small molecular impurities. This purification step is critical for obtaining high-purity NSC dots and ensuring accurate characterization results, particularly for quantum yield measurements and spectroscopic analyses. The 1000 Da MWCO was selected to retain the carbon dots while effectively removing low molecular weight impurities, including unreacted citric acid, l 2.5. Stock solution preparation and construction of the calibration curve An accurate weight of ICA powder was dissolved in methanol to prepare a 1000 μg mL −1 −1 λ λ versus 2.6. Preparation of icariin-incorporated nanocarriers The nano-delivery system comprising ICA-loaded whey protein nanoparticles was prepared via 37–39 in vitro The suggested fluorometric approach was used to evaluate the amount of free ICA in order to determine the entrapment efficiency, as stated in the previous study. 40 eqn (1) 41,42 1 2.7.  In vitro The hemolytic percentages of ICA-loaded whey nanoparticles were checked by quantifying the released haemoglobin from erythrocytes after incubation with red blood cells (RBCs). Blood from healthy rats was collected in EDTA tubes and instantly centrifuged for 5 minutes at 700× g −1 g 39,43 2 2.8. Anticoagulation potential assay The anticoagulation potential assay of the ICA-incorporated whey nanocarriers and whey nanoparticles was conducted by measuring the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to determine the clotting time, using an automated coagulometer (MC 4, Merlin, Germany). 44,45 −1 −1 −1 −1 2 One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compute the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of all collected data in the presence and absence of ICA and whey nanoparticles. Tukey's post hoc analysis was then performed to determine the statistical significance at p 2.9.  In silico Crystal structures for coagulation factors Xa (PDB: 1IGQ 3LC3 4TY6 6B74 Docking was performed using the Lead Finder docking algorithm implemented in Flare 9.0.0 by using the “Very Accurate but Slow” method and by centering a 7.0 Å docking grid on the crystallographic ligands. In both cases, the optimum pose was selected for comparison. Calculations were run and images were generated with Flare™, version 9.0, Cresset®, Litlington, Cambridgeshire, UK. The best pose for each compound was evaluated based on the obtained dG-scoring function docking scores in addition to visual inspection, taking into account the coordination, hydrogen bond interactions, and hydrophobic contacts compared to those observed for the co-crystallized ligand. 3 Results and discussion 3.1. NSC-dots characterization More than 70% of the synthesized C-dots had a good quantum yield. 46 et al. 46 et al. 46 The produced NSC dots were characterized utilizing a variety of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. UV-vis spectroscopy and fluorescence were utilized to determine the optical characteristics of the generated NSC-dots. The luminescence spectrum of the prepared NSC dots was scanned, and as shown in Fig. 1B λ em λ ex −1 Fig. 1B Fig. 1C TEM was conducted to visualize the morphology, particle size, and distribution of the NSC dots, providing direct evidence of their structural features. Fig. S1A and S1B in the SI reveal that the synthesized NSC-dots are spherical with particle sizes ranging from 2.18 to 9.8 nm. Moreover, FTIR analysis was performed to identify the functional groups present on the NSC-dots’ surface and confirm the chemical bonding characteristics. Fig. S1C in the SI shows that an amino N–H stretching vibration band was observed at 3418 cm −1 −1 −1 −1 <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.0\" width=\"13.200000pt\" height=\"16.000000pt\" viewBox=\"0 0 13.200000 16.000000\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\"><metadata>\nCreated by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019\n</metadata><g transform=\"translate(1.000000,15.000000) scale(0.017500,-0.017500)\" fill=\"currentColor\" stroke=\"none\"><path d=\"M0 440 l0 -40 320 0 320 0 0 40 0 40 -320 0 -320 0 0 -40z M0 280 l0 -40 320 0 320 0 0 40 0 40 -320 0 -320 0 0 -40z\"/></g></svg> −1 −1 −1 46–49 Additionally, an XPS examination was performed to clarify the chemical states and elemental composition of the synthesized NSC-dots, offering insights into the surface chemistry of the material. Following the application of the QDs solution on Si substrates, the sample was prepared for room-temperature drying. The spectra of the samples were recorded with an aluminum anode (Al Kα = 1486.6 eV). As shown in Fig. S2 in the SI, the XPS spectrum proved the presence of carbon (C 1s), nitrogen (N 1s), and oxygen (O 1s), which were in agreement with a previous report. 46,49 Carbon was found in three separate chemical environments, as shown by the three unique peaks found in the high-resolution C 1s spectra. A signal at 284.38 eV was found to correlate with sp 2 3 3.2. Quenching mechanism elucidation The fluorescence intensity of the manufactured NSC-dots was quantitatively quenched upon the addition of increasing concentrations of ICA, as demonstrated in Fig. S3 in the SI. Three major categories can be used to describe the quenching mechanism: dynamic quenching, inner filter effect (IFE), and static quenching. 47,48 30,47 30,47,48,50 The corrected fluorescence intensity was computed using the following eqn (3) 30,47,48,50 3 F corrected F observed ( A ex A em F corrected F observed A ex A em 30,47,48,50 Next, the suppressed efficiency (% E) for the corrected and observed fluorescence intensities was calculated using the following formula ( eqn (4) 30,47,48,50 4 E F F 0 F F 0 versus 30,47,48,50 Results in Fig. S5 in the SI demonstrated a decline in the suppression efficacy, indicating that IFE contributes to the ICA-induced quenching of NSC-dots fluorescence. 30,47,48,50 In addition to IFE, other potential mechanisms that could be involved in quenching the native fluorescence of NSC-dots were identified using the Stern–Volmer eqn (5) 3–6 5 F 0 F K sv K q t 0 F 0 F K sv K q −8 t 0 3,5 The Stern–Volmer plot's temperature dependency was examined to distinguish between static and dynamic quenching. 3–6 K sv K sv 3–6 Collisional quenching is brought on by higher temperatures because diffusion proceeds more quickly. However, static quenching is usually less successful because weakly bound complexes dissolve at higher temperatures. 3,4 As can be seen in Fig. S6 in the SI, the increase in temperature leads to a K sv K sv 3 3 3 −1 3,5 Therefore, it was concluded that the static quenching mechanism was found to be also responsible for the NSC-dots fluorescence intensity quenching in the presence of the quencher drug. 3,5 3.3. Method optimization Several factors were studied to get the best quenching impact and the best sensitivity, such as buffer pH, the effect of diluting solvent, and the effect of incubation time. First, for studying the effect of the buffer pH, the universal Britton–Robinson buffer (0.04 M) was used to cover the pH range of 2–12. Fig. S7A (in the SI) shows that the pH does not affect the improvement in the quenching of the NSC-dots by ICA. Second, for studying the impact of the diluting solvent on the fluorescence intensity, different solvents were studied, such as deionized water, 0.1 M H 3 4 2 4 3.4. Validation of the proposed method The performance of the proposed technique was validated according to the ICH standards. 47,51 Table 1 Table 1 Validation parameters for the spectrofluorometric method suggested for the determination of ICA  λ 418 nm  λ 370 nm Linearity range 1–20 μg mL −1 Intercept (a) 19.02 Slope (b) 10.57 Standard deviation of the intercept ( S a 0.77 Standard deviation of the slope ( S b 0.07 RSD% of the slope ( S b 0.66 Correlation coefficient ( r 0.9998 Standard deviation of residuals ( S y x 1.17 LOD (μg mL −1 0.24 LOQ (μg mL −1 0.73 3.4.1.

Detection and quantification limits Moreover, the limit of detection (LOD) and Limit of quantitation (LOQ) were computed using the subsequent formulas (3.3 S a/b a/b S a y Table 1 3.4.4. Selectivity As ICA is mainly used as an aphrodisiac, the quenching effect of the possible concurrently delivered medications was investigated to gauge the selectivity of the developed luminous sensor. For instance, sildenafil and avanafil are used for erectile dysfunction, in addition to dapoxetine, which is used for the treatment of premature ejaculation. Furthermore, the effect of yohimbine as a nutraceutical aphrodisiac on quantum dots was tested. Due to the investigated anticoagulant effect of ICA, the anticoagulant clopidogrel and the antiplatelet aspirin were tested for the quenching possibility against the devised quantum dots. The effect of a blank nano-formula was also examined. All of the aforementioned drugs and blank did not suppress the fluorescence intensity of the luminous probe or interfere with the ICA fluorometric assay. 3.5. Preparation of icariin-incorporated nanocarriers Although several studies have confirmed the therapeutic potential of ICA, its poor aqueous solubility and weak bioavailability have seriously prohibited novel drug development. Therefore, the development of water-soluble pharmaceutical preparations incorporating ICA is advantageous to give a preferable curative effect. 9 via 3.6.  In vitro Spectrophotometric assessment of the liberated haemoglobin from the damaged RBCs was used for the evaluation of hemolysis in blood samples after interaction with the therapeutic ingredients. The hemolytic impact of the prepared ICA-loaded whey protein nanoparticles on RBCs was monitored. As depicted in Fig. S9 in the SI, ICA-loaded whey protein nanoparticles exhibited minimal hemolytic rate ranging from 0.54%–3% for the lowest and highest checked concentrations, respectively, indicating excellent hemocompatibility as it is constructed from naturally derived materials. This minimal hemolytic percent could be assigned to the negative zeta potential value (−15.9 mV), which is thought to avoid interaction with the negative RBCs. 38 3.7.  In vitro in silico 3.7.1. Anticoagulation potential assay Various studies demonstrated the antiplatelet and anticoagulant activities of dietary-rich flavonoids, as they are qualified to regulate blood coagulation, platelet aggregation, and fibrinolysis, owing to their action on diverse enzymes and receptors. Thus, it is likely that these could create a significant agent in the protection and therapy remediation of CVDs. 52,53 9 In vitro 44 Table 3 via et al. 54 55 Table 3 Effect of icariin-loaded whey protein nanoparticles on the PT and aPTT coagulation time in vitro a Test Compared groups Mean 1 ± SD Mean 2 ± SD Adjusted P PT in seconds Normal plasma vs. 13.80 ± 0.20 13.67 ± 0.21 0.9269 Normal plasma vs. 13.80 ± 0.20 17.67 ± 0.12 <0.0001 Normal plasma vs. 13.80 ± 0.20 19.23 ± 0.42 <0.0001 Normal saline vs. 13.67 ± 0.21 17.67 ± 0.12 <0.0001 Normal saline vs. 13.67 ± 0.21 19.23 ± 0.42 <0.0001 Whey vs. 17.67 ± 0.12 19.23 ± 0.42 0.0004 APTT in seconds Normal plasma vs. 35.60 ± 1.22 35.80 ± 2.21 0.9981 Normal plasma vs. 35.60 ± 1.22 86.20 ± 1.05 <0.0001 Normal plasma vs. 35.60 ± 1.22 100.27 ± 0.93 <0.0001 Normal saline vs. 35.80 ± 2.21 86.20 ± 1.05 <0.0001 Normal saline vs. 35.80 ± 2.21 100.27 ± 0.93 <0.0001 Whey vs. 86.20 ± 1.05 100.27 ± 0.93 <0.0001 a Statistical significance at p 3.7.2. Docking study of the proposed anticoagulant activity of ICA To investigate the molecular basis of the measured icariin's anticoagulant activity, we performed docking simulations of icariin against various coagulation factors, including coagulation factors, including Xa, IXa, XIa and XIIa. Crystal structures with co-crystallized ligands were obtained from the Protein Data Bank 56 57 58 The dG-scoring function, docking scores, and visual inspections were used to evaluate the predicted binding poses. Icariin exhibited a favorable docking score and maintained key interactions observed for the co-crystallized ligand when docked into the binding site of human coagulation factor Xa (PDB ID: 1IGQ The docking protocol was validated by redocking the co-crystallized ligand for each protein crystal structure, and the obtained docking poses were checked for reproducing the key interactions observed in the crystal structure, in addition to assessing the pose consistency across multiple runs. On inspecting the obtained docking poses for the ICA into the binding pocket of Human coagulation factor Xa, one of them ( Fig. 2 G −1 −1 Fig. 2 (A) Selected docking pose for icariin in the catalytic binding site for human coagulation factor Xa (PDB: 1IGQ Further analysis for the protein ligand interactions expressed by both the co-crystallized ligand and ICA revealed that two major hydrogen bonding interactions are observed for the co-crystallized ligand ( Fig. 3a Fig. 3b Fig. 3 (A) Binding interactions observed for the co-crystallized ligand. (B) Binding interactions observed for the selected icariin docking pose. Conclusively, based on the above-mentioned docking results, ICA displayed an inhibitory impact on the activity of coagulation factor Xa and could extend the aPTT and PT coagulation times.

Trio color-coded assessment (green, blue, and white assessment) The trio color-coded protocol 61–63 24 25 25 20 Different assessment tools were used, including the analytical eco-scale (AES), 64 65 66 67 68 69 With the highest AES score of 94 (above 75) and the highest AGREE result (0.83), the proposed spectrofluorimetric methodology was found to be a superior green analysis when compared with other electrochemical and chromatographic methods (Table S1 in the SI and Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Comparison of the AGREE of the (a) proposed spectrofluorimetric method with the reported (b) CZE, (c) HPLC, (d) HPTLC and (e) LC-MS/MS methods for the determination of ICA. Regarding complex GAPI, it is considered an add-on assessment for the well-known green analytical procedure index. It integrates additional fields concerning the process carried out before the main analytical assay. This tool is implemented particularly in cases where the analysis involves the use of deep eutectic solvents or nanoparticles. The devised method shows great performance with 16 green zones and 9 yellow zones, as shown in Fig. 5A Fig. 5 (A) Complex GAPI diagram and (B) BAGI assessment of the blue profile for assessing the performance of the proposed spectrofluorimetric method for the determination of ICA. The novel BAGI software is a new metric to evaluate the applicability and practicality of an analytical procedure. This metric is based on ten main attributes to find the strong and weak points of a method. With a score of 72.5 in the middle of the asteroid pictogram (>60 points), our method is considered practical ( Fig. 5B The multicriteria RGB-12 model was implemented to acquire a comprehensive assessment of the complete analytical process concerning the GAC's principles, economic factors, and validation criteria. 70–72 RGBfast is a new version of RGB 12 designed to make assessing whiteness more user-friendly and straightforward. It consists of six assessment criteria with the incorporation of the ChlorTox Scale as a main greenness indicator. As demonstrated in Table 4 Table 4 RGBfast profiles of the proposed spectrofluorimetric method and other reported methods Method Redness Greenness Blueness Whiteness Proposed spectrofluorimetric method 73.2 81.4 65.5 73 Reported CZE method 50.5 77.2 24.9 46 Reported HPLC method 75.6 37.2 33.2 45 Reported HPTLC method 43.8 69.0 59.6 56 Reported LC-MS/MS method 48.4 33.0 27.5 35 In summary, the results of the different assessments surpass the performance of the fluorometric approach in comparison to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and liquid chromatographic methods (HPLC, HPTLC, and HPLC-MS/MS). This might be attributed to the use of hazardous organic solvents such as acetonitrile in the case of CZE, HPLC, and LC-MS/MS, while ethyl acetate is used in the case of HPTLC, in addition to the higher cost and energy consumed by the chromatographic techniques. Nevertheless, the suggested method has the advantage of using deionized water as the primary solvent and diluent for everything from QD synthesis to drug analysis. It also offers low-cost, simple, and affordable analysis with no special requirements. 3.8.1. The sustainability proof While analysts have long recognized the need for green chemistry from the laboratory to industry and have developed various sustainable practices, a crucial link to the United Nations' SDGs has been missing. Analysts are now moving beyond simple ‘environmentally friendly’ practices by intentionally designing analytical methods to advance these global goals, building on the long-standing understanding of green sustainable chemistry. To assess the new concept of ‘Analytical Chemistry for Sustainability,’ a novel evaluation tool, the NQS Index, was developed. 73 Table 5 Table 5 Compatibility of the proposed spectrofluorimetric method with various sustainable development goals SDG Agreement Remarks GOAL 3: good health and well-being 1 Focusing on well-being, this effort uses eco-conscious analytical methods and natural alternatives to address cardiovascular disease GOAL 4: quality education 1 This research enhances educational quality by providing new insights into the analysis of nutraceuticals, drug repurposing, green chemistry and sustainable practices, enabling their inclusion in teaching and training GOAL 5: gender equality 1 This project demonstrates fair and balanced involvement from researchers of all genders GOAL 6: clean water and sanitation 1 This study uses water as a main solvent and actively reduces the waste production GOAL 7: affordable and clean energy 1 Laboratories can decrease their energy footprint by implementing energy-efficient analytical methods, notably spectrofluorimetric method GOAL 8: decent work and economic growth 1 A practical method for achieving faster analysis and greater efficiency, resulting in economic benefits GOAL 9: industry, innovation and infrastructure 1 This versatile analytical technique, applicable to nutraceutical nano-formulations, fosters stronger collaborations between academia and the pharmaceutical sector, leading to substantial time and resource savings GOAL 11: sustainable cities and communities 1 Ecofriendly practices provide the dual advantage of enhancing urban lab efficiency while minimizing ecological harm GOAL 12: responsible consumption and production 1 The elimination of dangerous solvents and the reduction of waste in this method translate to a practical and cost-saving solution, leading to reduced time, effort, and expenses GOAL 13: climate action 1 Environmental safety is paramount in this technique, which uses water and reduces waste, leading to savings in time, money, and labor GOAL 14: life below water 1 By choosing water as a main solvent, we contribute to the prevention of chemical contamination in water systems, which is vital for marine life GOAL 15: life on land 1 Shifting to water-based analytical methods, instead of using harmful chemicals, helps to safeguard land-based ecosystems from pollution and damage GOAL 17: partnerships to achieve the goal 1 Partnerships and collaboration are exemplified by the participation of researchers from multiple disciplines, institutions, and genders, all working towards sustainable scientific practices  Number of agreements  13  % Sustainability  76 4 Conclusion and future perspective The current methodology offers a feasible, valid, cost-effective, and rapid assay of ICA either in bulk form or in whey-based nano-formulation. This spectrofluorimetric framework is based on the quenching tendency of ICA against the in-lab microwave-fabricated quantum dots. Furthermore, a comprehensive investigation of the anticoagulant activity of ICA was performed in vitro in silico in vivo By integrating green quantum dots in spectrofluorimetric analysis, this approach not only ensures eco-friendly, accurate assessment but also paves the way for more effective and sustainable drug delivery systems in nutraceutical research.
