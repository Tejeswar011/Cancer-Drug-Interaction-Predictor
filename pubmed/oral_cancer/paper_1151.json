Introduction Selenium is an essential trace element with the symbol Se, atomic number 34 and relative atomic mass 78.96. It has been proven to have a wide range of physiological functions in animals, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 The uterus is an important reproductive organ in female mammalians, responsible for functions such as embryo implantation, maintaining pregnancy, and fetal development, and plays an indispensable role in the reproductive process. Therefore, maintaining such a good physiological condition of the uterus is essential for ensuring the smooth and secure reproductive process of female animals. Thus, the essential tasks of population continuity and reproduction are realized. In recent years, with the continuous deepening of research, the relationship between selenium and animal uterine health has gradually become a research hotspot. More and more evidence shows that selenium is closely related to animal uterine health. Adequate selenium levels can promote uterine development, improve uterine function during pregnancy, and help prevent and treat uterine diseases [ 7 In animal husbandry, the bioavailability of selenium is regulated by multiple factors, among which the source and type of selenium and the interaction mechanism with nutrients are key influencing factors [ 8 9 10 11 12 Table 1 13 10 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 2. Physiological Functions of Selenium in Animals 2.1. Antioxidant Function Selenium is an important component of several antioxidant enzymes, such as GPx. GPx catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides to water and corresponding alcohols [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 32 38 39 40 41 42 Figure 1 2.2. Anti-Inflammatory Function Selenium also plays a role in regulating the inflammatory response in animals. It can modulate the expression and activity of various inflammatory mediators ( Figure 1 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 Figure 1 50 51 52 53 2.3. Anti-Apoptotic Function Cell apoptosis is a programmed cell death, which plays an important role in maintaining tissue homeostasis [ 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 58 62 63 64 Figure 1 65 66 2.4. Immune-Regulatory Function Selenium is essential for the normal development and function of the immune system in animals, as it affects the proliferation, differentiation, and function of immune cells such as lymphocytes and macrophages [ 2 67 68 69 40 57 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 Figure 1 3. Selenium and Uterine Development 3.1. Effects on Uterine Morphology and Structure Selenium in mammals is primarily obtained from the diet. Both monogastric animals and humans can digest and absorb dietary selenium efficiently, with human utilization rates ranging from 56% to 91% [ 78 79 2− 80 Table 2 During the growth and development of female animals, the level of selenium has an impact on the development of uterine morphology and structure [ 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 Selenium promotes the proliferation of uterine cells and has an impact on the development, maintenance of physiological functions, and repair of the uterus after injury [ 88 89 90 91 92 91 93 94 95 96 86 96 97 98 99 100 3.2. Molecular Mechanisms and Signaling Pathways Selenium affects uterine development by regulating the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. The key to this is the regulation of growth factor signaling. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) [ 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 Figure 2 108 109 Also, selenium can affect uterine development through other cell signaling pathways. In addition to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway mentioned above, these include the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [ 110 111 112 113 Figure 2 114 115 116 117 118 60 119 59 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 Besides the above-mentioned cell signaling pathways, selenium also affects the expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix components such as collagen and fibronectin [ 131 132 biology-14-01295-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Selenium requirements in different mammalian species and maximum doses used.

Selenium and Uterine Function During Pregnancy 4.1. Embryo Implantation Implantation is a critical step in the pregnancy process and an important stage in early embryonic development [ 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 27 142 143 144 145 146 147 Figure 3 4.2. Pregnancy Maintenance During pregnancy, the growth and development of the fetus require a stable intrauterine environment. Selenium plays a role in this process in multiple ways. First, it helps maintain normal placental function and nutrient transfer, selenium deficiency in pregnant mice leads to restricted fetal growth [ 148 149 150 151 152 153 81 154 155 148 156 157 158 159 148 4.3. Parturition The effects of selenium on the uterus of female animals are also evident during the birthing process. Selenium may influence the contractility of uterine smooth muscle, thereby affecting the expulsion of the fetus during childbirth. Research indicates that selenium deficiency can lead to abnormal contractions of uterine smooth muscle in animals [ 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 Figure 3 167 5. Selenium and Uterine Diseases 5.1. Endometritis Endometritis is a common uterine disease in female animals, especially dairy cows and sows, and may be caused by bacterial infections such as Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus 168 41 169 170 Figure 4 87 171 172 169 173 174 175 5.2. Uterine Fibrosis Endometrial fibrosis is a condition of the endometrium characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (such as collagen) in the uterus, which can impair uterine function and fertility [ 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 131 183 184 185 131 186 187 Figure 4 5.3. Retained Placenta Retained placenta refers to the failure of a female animal to expel the placental membranes within a specific timeframe after calving. It is a common reproductive disorder in livestock such as dairy cows and sows [ 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 5.4. Other Uterine Diseases In addition to endometritis and uterine fibrosis, selenium may be associated with other uterine disorders. For example, selenium’s function in regulating blood vessels and aspects of its antioxidant activity can play a role in certain uterine bleeding disorders [ 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 Figure 4 202 203 6. Conclusions Selenium is an essential trace element for mammals, supporting uterine function through multiple physiological mechanisms. These mechanisms include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory actions. Specifically, selenium promotes normal uterine development and structural formation, ensuring successful embryo implantation and pregnancy maintenance, while regulating uterine smooth muscle contractions during labor. Selenium also prevents and treats common uterine disorders such as endometritis and uterine fibrosis. Meanwhile, we found that there are significant differences in the bioavailability and safety of different forms of selenium sources. Organic selenium shows better application prospects in improving uterine health and reproductive performance in animals due to its higher absorption efficiency and lower risk of toxicity. Current research on the effects of selenium on the mammalian uterus has been limited to animals that bring economic effects such as cattle, sheep, and pigs, and little research has been done on companion animals such as dogs and cats. We hope that more studies focusing on different species will fill this gap in the future. Future research should further clarify the differences in selenium requirements of different animal species at different physiological stages, explore the synergistic mechanism between selenium and other nutrients, and optimize selenium supplementation strategies. This aims to achieve the goal of precise regulation of animal uterine health and enhancement of breeding efficiency. The development of selenium-containing supplements for female mammals should be pursued to improve production and treat diseases. In-depth exploration of the molecular mechanisms of selenium in the field of uterine health will provide important theoretical support for the development of new animal reproductive health technologies and green feed additives. It can promote the development of animal husbandry in the direction of high efficiency, health and sustainability.

Species Organic Selenium Inorganic Selenium Hens [ 26 Bacterial organic selenium supplementation promotes eggshell mineralization and increases blood selenium concentrations. Supplementation with inorganic selenium also increased antioxidant enzyme levels, but GPX3/GPX4 levels were much lower than supplementation with organic selenium. Cows [ 27 Conceptus length was increased in heifers supplemented with MIX (both ISe and Ose) (25.96 ± 3.95 cm) compared with ISe (17.45 ± 3.08 cm). Glucose in amniotic fluid of ISe-supplemented ewes was less than in the MIX group. Rats [ 28 Selenium concentration in placenta samples from the selenium nanoparticle group was 2-fold higher than that in placenta samples from the sodium selenate-treated group. Body weights of pregnant rats in the SeNPs group were lower than those in the NaSe group at day 21. Pigs [ 29 Increase in litter weight of piglets in HMSeBA-supplemented dams during pregnancy compared to the Na 2 3 Reduced elevation of maternal antioxidant enzyme activities in the Na 2 3 ",
