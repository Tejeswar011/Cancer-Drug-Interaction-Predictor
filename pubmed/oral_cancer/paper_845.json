Introduction Inflammation is the body’s multifaceted biological response to protect itself from detrimental stimuli, including infections, damaged cells, or irritants. Acute inflammation is essential to the immune system’s defense and aids in healing; however, chronic or uncontrolled inflammation is associated with several disorders, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type II diabetes, and asthma [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, also called prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS), plays a pivotal role in inflammation via catalyzing the oxidative conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) into prostaglandin H 2 2 2 2 2 2 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 The medicinal chemistry community has shown a significant interest in the pyrazolo[3,4- d 29 30 31 d 32 33 d 34 35 36 37 38 I II 50 Figure 1 50 50 39 This study presents the synthesis of novel N d 2.

Molecular Modelling Study For molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, the crystal structures of human cyclooxygenase-1 (PDB ID: 3KK6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (PDB ID: 3LN1) were selected. These structures were chosen due to their high-resolution crystallographic data (2.75 Å and 2.40 Å, respectively) and the presence of the co-crystallized selective inhibitor—celecoxib—which provided reference ligands for grid box definition and comparative interaction analysis. Furthermore, both entries are widely used in COX-focused structure-based drug design, offering a well-established and validated framework for modelling studies. Importantly, these structures are free of artificial mutations or structural artifacts, ensuring accurate representation of the native enzyme conformations and active site architecture.

Biology 3.2.1. In Vitro Cyclooxygenase (COX) Inhibition Assay The tested compounds and celecoxib were evaluated for their ability to inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 isozymes using the COX Inhibitor Screening Kit (Fluorometric) from BioVision (Milpitas, CA, USA; Catalog No. K547), according to the manufacturer’s instructions [ 63 3.2.2. In Vivo Carrageenan-Induced Paw Edema Eighty-four male BALB/c mice, aged 12 weeks, were procured from the Animal Facility of Sohag University. The Animal Ethics Committee of IACUC approved the protocol, approval number 12-3-1/2025-01. The previously described protocol by Winter et al. [ 64 w v 3.2.3. ELISA Assay for Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) All mice were sacrificed under anesthesia using ketamine/xylazine (50/15 mg/kg). Blood was collected for the ELISA assays to determine the levels of cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 using the Rat IL6 (Interleukin 6) ELISA Kit and Rat TNFα ELISA Kit (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique is the fundamental principle of the TNF-α assay. A microplate was pre-coated with an antibody specific for TNF-α. Standards and samples were pipetted into the wells, and the immobilized antibody bound to any TNF-α that was present. A biotin-conjugated antibody that was specific for TNF-α was introduced to the wells after any unbound substances were removed. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated with avidin was introduced to the wells subsequent to the cleaning process. After a wash to eliminate any unbound avidin–enzyme reagent, a substrate solution was introduced to the wells, and the color developed in proportion to the quantity of TNF-α bound in the initial step. The color development was halted, and the color intensity was quantified. Additionally, the Sandwich enzyme immunoassay is the test principle utilized for IL-6. The microtiter plates included in this preparation were pre-coated with an antibody that was specific to Rat IL6. A biotin-conjugated antibody specific to Rat IL6 was then added to the appropriate microtiter plate wells along with standards or samples. Subsequently, each microplate well was incubated with avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The only wells exhibited a change in color were those that contain Rat IL6, biotin-conjugated antibody, and enzyme-conjugated avidin after the TMB substrate solution was added. The addition of sulfuric acid solution terminated the enzyme–substrate reaction, and the color change was observed spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm ± 10 nm. The concentration of Rat IL6 in the samples was subsequently determined by comparing the OD of the samples to the standard curve. 3.2.4. Histopathological Examination The stomachs were also dissected for histopathological examination to assess the degree of inflammatory response produced in the gastric layers using celecoxib as a reference drug. Stomach tissue sections were fixed using 10% buffered neutral formalin, and the stomach tissue samples were processed and stained by H&E [ 64 3.2.5. Animals Twelve-week-old male mice (120–150 gm) were obtained from the Animal Facility of Sohag University, Sohag, Egypt. The animals were housed together according to treatment randomization and subjected to a 12 h:12 h light–dark cycle in a temperature-controlled environment and maintained on a standard chow diet and water ad libitum. 3.2.6. Blood Collection Blood was collected immediately following the decapitation of mice, performed in accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) guidelines. After decapitation, whole blood was allowed to flow freely and was collected directly into EDTA and heparinized tubes. The whole blood was centrifuged at 3000× g 3.2.7. Ethical Approval All experimental protocols were accepted by the Sohag Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC approval #: 12-3-1/2025-01) 3.2.8. Statistical Analysis Data were expressed as the mean and SD (n = 6). Statistical significance was determined using two-way ANOVA, with p 3.3. Molecular Docking Molecular docking was carried out using AutoDock Vina 4.2, employing the rigid protein–flexible ligand protocol. The crystal structures of human COX-1 (PDB ID: 3KK6) and COX-2 (PDB ID: 3LN1) were prepared by removing co-crystallized ligands and water molecules, adding polar hydrogens, and assigning Gasteiger charges using AutoDock Tools. The docking grid boxes were defined around the binding site of the co-crystallized ligands with the following parameters: for COX-1: grid center at (x = –19.67, y = 49.71, z = 41.53) with box dimensions of 28 × 28 × 28 Å; for COX-2: grid center at (x = 18.65, y = –53.12, z = 53.67) with box dimensions of 30 × 30 × 30 Å. The exhaustiveness parameter was set to 16 to ensure thorough conformational sampling. Binding poses were ranked based on docking affinity scores, and the most populated poses from the MD simulations were used for further analysis. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) threshold for ligand-to-binding site shape matching was set at 2.0 Å. The interaction energies were determined using the CHARMM force field (v. 1.02), with a non-bonded cutoff distance of 10.0 Å and a distance-dependent dielectric. An energy grid extending 5.0 Å from the binding site was established. Editing and visualization of the generated binding poses were performed using PyMOL software [ 65 3.3.1. Molecular Dynamics Simulation MD simulations were conducted using NAMD 2.9 software, which employs the CHARMM36 force field. Protein systems were constructed using the QwikMD toolkit of VMD software [ 66 + − 67 3.3.2. Binding Free Energy Calculations The binding free energy of the docked complex was calculated using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) method, as implemented in the MMPBSA.py module of AMBER18 [ 68 ΔG Binding = ΔG Complex − ΔG Receptor − ΔG Inhibitor. Each term in the equation involves calculating multiple energy components, including van der Waals energy, electrostatic energy, internal energy from molecular mechanics, and the polar contribution to solvation energy. 3.4. Physicochemical and Pharmacokinetic Prediction The physicochemical characteristics and pharmacokinetics were predicted using Swiss ADME, a freely accessible service offered by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics [ 69 p 2 2 4.
