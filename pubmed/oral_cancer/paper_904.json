Introduction Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large and diverse group of man-made chemicals characterized by their unique physicochemical properties and broad range of applications. PFAS refer to compounds containing at least one of the following three structural configurations: (1) R-(CF 2 2 2 2 3 3 1 2 3 4 5 PFAS exhibit multi-organ toxicity and carcinogenicity, and their environmental persistence and mobility lead to widespread distribution across various environmental media. PFAS have broad toxic effects on organisms, including hepatotoxicity [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Human exposure to PFAS occurs mainly through diet, inhalation, and dermal contact, with dietary intake being the predominant pathway, and aquatic products serving as a significant exposure vector. Due to the widespread presence of PFAS in the environment, humans are inevitably exposed to these substances. Studies show that the risk of PFAS exposure is much higher for individuals in special environments and related industries than for the general population [ 20 21 22 22 23 24 25 Human exposure to PFAS occurs mainly through diet, inhalation, and dermal contact. Among these, dietary intake is the predominant pathway, with aquatic products serving as a significant exposure vector. Due to the widespread presence of PFAS in the environment, humans are inevitably exposed to these substances. Studies show that individuals in special environments and related industries face a much higher risk of PFAS exposure compared to the general population [ 20 21 22 22 23 24 25 EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), based on the effects of PFAS on the immune system, in 2020 adopted a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, using a daily intake of 0.64 ng/kg bw as a starting point, identified perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), PFOS, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) as the primary PFAS monomers of concern, and established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) recommendation of 4.4 ng/kg bw per week for the sum of the intakes of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, and PFOS [ 26 27 28 29 Focusing on Zhejiang Province as a typical coastal and industrial region, this study investigates the contamination characteristics, source apportionment, and health risks of PFAS in locally consumed aquatic products. As one of the major fluorochemical-producing areas in southeastern China with high per capita consumption of seafood, Zhejiang offers a critical context for examining PFAS pollution resulting from both industrial and dietary pathways [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 2. Results 2.1. Pollutant Characteristics PFAS contamination is widespread in aquatic organisms. Among the 21 PFAS analyzed, 87.9% of the 306 shellfish and crustacean samples tested positive, though contamination levels varied significantly across groups. Detection rates followed this order: marine crustaceans (97.1%) > bivalves (88.8%) > freshwater crustaceans (76.1%). Samples with ≥10 PFAS monomers were rare but most frequent in bivalves (7.7%) and marine crustaceans (7.3%), compared to freshwater crustaceans (3.0%). Σ 21 In bivalves, PFOA was the most frequently detected PFAS (64.7%), followed by PFOS (53.8%), PFNA (52.9%), PFDA (50.0%), and PFTrDA (44.1%). PFOA also showed the highest median concentration (0.1850 ng/g ww), exceeding PFOS (0.0508 ng/g ww), PFNA (0.0228 ng/g ww), and PFBA (0.0133 ng/g ww) ( Figure 1 Among crustacean products, freshwater crustaceans showed the highest detection rate for PFUdA (70.1%), followed by PFTrDA (65.7%), PFDA (62.7%), and PFOS (61.2%), with PFUdA exhibiting the highest median concentration (0.3190 ng/g ww) ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Compliance with EU regulatory limits was assessed for PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, and PFHxS in shellfish and crustaceans ( n 29 4 The Sankey diagram ( Figure 2 2.2. Source Apportionment of 21 PFAS in Shellfish and Crustacean Samples Prior to source apportionment, it should be noted that PFAS accumulation may vary across species; therefore, data from different types of organisms were not pooled directly. To assess differences in PFAS composition and concentration among bivalves, freshwater crustaceans, and marine crustaceans, this study applied PERMANOVA. The results revealed statistically significant differences among the three groups (F = 3.49, p p p p Text S1 The EPA PMF 5.0 model was employed to identify potential sources of PFAS contamination in bivalves. Following the official user guide, to ensure analytical accuracy, only contaminants with detection frequencies greater than 20% were included. Based on prior knowledge, three probable contamination sources were hypothesized: water pollution, industrial chemical release, and atmospheric deposition. Accordingly, the model was run with factor numbers ranging from 3 to 7, with each factor representing a potential pollution source. The optimal number of factors was determined based on the Q-value; too few factors may lead to incomplete separation of sources, while too many may indicate overfitting. In the results for bivalves, it was observed that when transitioning from the 4-factor model to the 5-factor model, both Q (Robust) and Q (True) decreased, while the Q (Robust)/Q (True) ratio increased. However, in the 6-factor model, the decreases in Q(Robust) and Q(True) were less pronounced, and the Q (Robust)/Q (True) ratio began to approach 1. Based on these findings, the 5-factor model was selected ( Figure S1 Figure S2 Figure S3 Figure S4 2.2.1. Crustacean Factor 1 and Factor 3: Sources from Different Industrial Processes ( Figure 3 The primary contributing pollutants for Factor 1 were perfluorotetradecanoic acid(PFTeDA)(60.0%) and perfluorododecanoic acid(PFDoA) (20.7%). The predominant pollutants for Factor 3 were PFTrDA (45.3%) and PFUdA (41.1%). The major contributing pollutants in both Factor 1 and Factor 3 were long-chain PFCAs. Existing research indicates that long-chain PFCA production primarily involves three major chemical engineering processes. Using fluorotelomer olefins as starting compounds, oxidation predominantly yields odd-numbered PFCAs [ 36 37 38 39 Figure 3 Proportion of individual PFAS compounds in crustaceans across different factors. ( a b c d 2.2.2. Crustacean Factor 2: Domestic Waste Area Composite Pollution ( Figure 3 Factor 2 primarily contributed to PFNA (58.8%) and PFUdA (39.7%) as pollutants. PFNA is commonly used in oil-proof coatings for textiles (outdoor apparel and carpets) and food packaging. PFNA may correlate with municipal solid waste leachate, with concentrations detected at 11–87 ng/L across three different leachate sites in Tianjin, China [ 40 40 38 2.2.3. Bivalves Factor 1: Short-Chain Fluorochemical Alternatives ( Figure 4 Factor 1 primarily contributes pollutants as PFBA (88.4%) and PFOA (9.2%). PFBA serves as a short-chain alternative to PFOA [ 41 42 43 44 Figure 4 Proportion of individual PFAS compounds in bivalves across different factors. ( a b c d e 2.2.4. Bivalve Factor 2: PTFE and PVDF Chemical Emissions ( Figure 4 Factor 2 was primarily composed of PFOA (82.75%) and PFNA (13.21%). The Jiangsu Suzhou New District Fluorochemical Industrial Park, one of the largest fluorochemical bases in Asia, hosts over 20 major international fluorochemical companies. Its primary products, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), are significant sources of PFOA and PFNA emissions into the environment [ 45 2.2.5. Factor 3 and Factor 4 in Bivalves: Atmospheric Deposition from Specific Industrial Production ( Figure 4 Factor 3 was predominantly contributed by PFTrDA (84.39%), while Factor 4 was primarily characterized by PFUdA (64.38%), PFDA (10.23%), and PFOS (9.83%). Both PFTrDA and PFUdA are long-chain odd-carbon-number PFCAs. Long-chain odd-carbon-number PFCAs are primarily associated with dust emissions from specific industrial processes [ 46 47 2.2.6. Crustacean Factor 4 and Bivalve Factor 5: Historical PFOS Chemical Industry and Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) Use ( Figure 3 Figure 4 In crustacean Factor 4, the main loadings were PFOS (54.1%), PFDA (17.1%), and PFUdA (14.6%). In bivalve Factor 5, the main loading was PFOS (83.0%). As surfactants and high-performance chemicals, PFOS compounds have been widely used in various consumer goods and industrial processes, such as firefighting foams, carpets, leather, fabrics, paper, cleaning products, pesticides, hydraulic fluids, semiconductors, photolithography, and metal plating [ 48 49 50 2.3.

Discussion Given the widespread presence of PFAS in the environment and the prominence of food contamination issues, this study focuses on shellfish and crustacean products in Zhejiang Province, systematically analyzing contamination characteristics of 21 PFAS and assessing exposure risks for adult consumers. Contamination characterization results indicate that PFAS contamination is prevalent in commercially available shellfish and crustaceans, and distinct interspecific variations are observed in the bioaccumulation of PFAS. Both marine and freshwater crustaceans demonstrated strong bioaccumulation capacity for long-chain PFCAs, PFUdA, and PFTrDA. In contrast, bivalves primarily accumulated PFOA and PFOS. These differences may be attributed to the following biological characteristics: (1) Species-specific differences and metabolic capacity: Crustaceans (e.g., shrimp and crabs), as higher-trophic-level predators with higher lipid content, tend to accumulate long-chain PFCAs (e.g., PFUdA and PFTrDA) due to their stronger hydrophobicity and environmental persistence [ 51 52 53 54 51 55 56 Both marine and freshwater crustaceans exhibited a strong capacity for bioaccumulation of long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), especially PFUdA and PFTrDA. This accumulation pattern can be attributed to several interrelated environmental and ecological factors. Aquatic habitats play a crucial role in shaping PFAS exposure profiles. Studies show that long-chain PFAS tend to accumulate more readily in sediment-rich environments through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions [ 57 58 59 60 61 PFOA constitutes the primary PFAS contaminant in bivalve mollusk products from Zhejiang Province, with notably higher exceedance rates of EU Regulation 2023/915 [ 29 62 63 54 58 64 In this study, source apportionment of PFAS contamination in bivalves and crustaceans indicates that pollutants likely originate from multiple contamination pathways, including but not limited to landfill leachate, industrial wastewater discharge, the use of aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs), and atmospheric deposition. These pathways contribute to the presence of PFAS in aquatic environments, leading to subsequent bioaccumulation in benthic and filter-feeding organisms. Studies indicate that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in agricultural biosolids can be redistributed via rainfall [ 65 66 67 This study reveals generally low Σ 4 4 68 69 70 This study has several limitations. Firstly, we adopted the P50 concentration to describe the overall PFAS profile in freshwater and marine crustaceans and as an indicator for calculating population exposure. This approach may underestimate extreme exposure scenarios. Random number imputation was used to handle non-detected values, aiming to reflect potential natural background contamination of PFAS. Such data processing methods may introduce a certain degree of uncertainty. The food frequency method employed in the 2015–2016 survey data may introduce recall bias, thereby affecting the results to some extent. Second, a potential limitation arises from the temporal gap between the dietary intake survey (conducted in 2015–2016) and the PFAS concentration measurements (obtained in 2023–2024). Shifts in dietary habits or contamination profiles over this period could introduce uncertainty to the exposure assessment. However, the 2015–2016 survey remains the most comprehensive and representative dataset available for aquatic product consumption in the study population. Moreover, consumption patterns of aquatic products in Zhejiang—a coastal region with established dietary traditions—are generally stable over time. Nonetheless, this chronological discrepancy is acknowledged as a limitation, and the need for future studies with temporally aligned data collection is emphasized in the Discussion. Furthermore, since the freshwater and marine crustacean samples commercially available in Zhejiang Province were sourced through distribution channels with often mixed origin information, this complicates source apportionment of PFAS in the samples and increases uncertainty. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Sample Collection From 2023 to 2024, 306 samples of freshwater crustaceans, marine crustaceans, and bivalves were collected from representative and typical seafood markets in Zhejiang province by trained investigators, including 170 samples of bivalves, 69 samples of marine crustaceans, and 67 samples of freshwater crustaceans. After collection, the samples were transported to the laboratory via cold chain. Tested crustacean and shellfish species details with exact sample counts are provided in Table S2 4.2. Sample Preparation and Analysis A total of 21 PFAS compounds were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), including 13 PFCAs (C4-C14, C16, and C18), 7 PFSAs (C4-C10), and one novel PFAS (ADONA). Isotope-labeled internal standards were employed for liquid chromatography, and the detection results were calculated based on the response values corrected by the internal standard method according to the standard calibration curve to determine concentrations (Mixed standard solutions, PFAC-MXC&PFAC-MXF, mass labeled PFAS mixed standard solutions MPFAC-C-ES (Wellington Laboratories, Guelph, ON, Canada). Controls, DIRM-NIP-PFAS-F (Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands) (5ppb standard TIC plot Figure S5 For shellfish, the soft tissues are removed from the shell; for crustaceans, the edible muscle tissue is collected. The tissues are homogenized using a pre-cooled homogenizer (4 °C), with liquid nitrogen flash-freezing applied when necessary. Aliquots of ≥500 g of the homogenate are dispensed into acid-washed polypropylene centrifuge tubes. The tubes are labeled and stored in a −80 °C ultra-low temperature freezer. Blank control samples are collected simultaneously throughout the entire procedure. Sample testing must be completed within six months. A total of 2 g of the Shellfish and Crustaceans sample was placed in a 50 mL polypropylene tube and spiked with internal standards (2 ng isotopic labeling PFAS; Wellington Laboratories, ON, Canada). An amount of 8 mL acetonitrile was added after fully mixing using 2 mL of water in a Vortex oscillator (250 r/min) for 3 min, and extracted using ultrasonic oscillation for 30 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation. Finally, the extracts were purified using an HLB-P/HMR-Lipid solid-phase extraction column (Anavo, Beijing, China). Amounts of 1.5 g sodium chloride were added, and after fully mixing, 4 mL of supernatant was concentrated with nitrogen until nearly dry and then diluted with methanol to a constant volume of 0.2 mL. Quantification was performed by isotope dilution using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry instrument (Xevo TQ-S; Waters, Milford, MA, USA). All reagents and consumables have been tested for blank to control background interference before use, and a spiked experiment has been added to each batch (10 samples) to ensure the accuracy of the experiment. Use DIRM-NIP-PFAS-F quality control samples for quality control in each experiment. The analytical method was optimized for the simultaneous determination of 21 PFAS using an Acquity UPLC ® ® Table S3 Table S4 When the sample amount is 2 g and the constant volume is 10.0 milliliters, with the constant volume of the sample solution being 0.2 milliliters, the detection limits for PFBA and PFPeA are 0.02 μg/kg, and the quantification limit is 0.06 μg/kg. For the remaining 19 perfluorinated compounds, the detection limit is 0.01 μg/kg and the quantification limit is 0.03 μg/kg. Partial samples TIC diagrams are shown in Figures S6 and S7 4.3. Consumption Data Collection Shellfish and crustacean consumption data were derived from the food consumption survey conducted in Zhejiang Province between 2015 and 2016. The survey was carried out in 10 cities and 18 counties/county-level cities in Zhejiang Province, with survey site selection following the Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling principle. Three townships (sub-districts) were selected in each county/city, two villages (neighborhood committees) were selected in each township (sub-district), and finally, 50 households were randomly selected in each village (neighborhood committee). A food frequency questionnaire was used to record the consumption status of participants. All participants signed informed consent forms, and their personal information was kept confidential. To ensure data quality, the project team provided unified technical training to all investigators before the survey, standardizing survey forms, interview procedures, and questionnaire completion standards. A three-level review mechanism was implemented for the questionnaires. Approximately 19,968 residents aged 3 years and above completed the food frequency questionnaire. After the survey, the raw data were cleaned, excluding records with extreme outliers and missing key information. Ultimately, 7354 adults (aged ≥18 years) who had consumed at least one type of marine crustacean, freshwater crustacean, or bivalve were selected and included in this analysis. These participants were divided into four groups: 18–30 years, 31–50 years, 51–59 years, and ≥60 years ( Figure 5 4.4. Data Quality Control Strict quality control measures were implemented throughout sampling, extraction, and instrumental analysis. Cold-chain transportation was maintained during sample collection and analysis, with transport blanks incorporated. Samples exhibiting abnormally high or low values underwent retesting (parallel analysis with original samples) to confirm authentic contamination. Outlier data verified as genuine contamination were retained after review, with enhanced data auditing and standardized documentation. Recovery rates of spiked samples were measured alongside detection limits (LOD), quantification limits (LOQ), and laboratory blanks. By spiking low-concentration samples, the spiked concentration when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is 3 is defined as the limit of detection (LOD), while the concentration when S/N reaches 10 is defined as the limit of quantification (LOQ). The value of non-detected samples was assumed to be the LOD divided by 2 in the exposure assessment and risk characterization. The LOD and LOQ values for all analyzed samples are detailed in the supporting document ( Table S5 4.5. Data Analysis Data analysis and visualization were performed using Python 3.12, R 4.43, and Excel 2019MSO (2304 Build 16.0.16327.20200). Normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For data that followed a normal distribution and met the assumption of homogeneity of variance (as evaluated by Levene’s test), an independent samples t p 4.6. Source Analysis of PFAS Source analysis was employed using the EPA-recommended PMF 5.0 software. Given the PMF model’s sensitivity to zero values and potential zero-inflation issues, values below LOD were not simply substituted with zero. Due to potential background PFAS contamination, assigning LOD/2 to non-detects might obscure actual pollution signals. Therefore, values below LOD in the PMF model were reassigned as random numbers between 0 and LOD, while detections between LOD and LOQ were calculated as LOQ/2 [ 34 The EPA-recommended PMF5.0 model was used for source apportionment of PFAS; this model defines the sample matrix as the product of two unknown factor matrices with a residual matrix: (1) X  =  G  F  +  E The sample matrix ( X F p G E 35 (2) Uncertainty  =  error × concentration 2 + LOD 2 The error rate is estimated at 0.1 based on experimental experience. Concentration represents the detected value (ng/g ww), while LOD denotes the contaminant’s detection limit (ng/g ww). As the PMF model requires a complete matrix for source apportionment, missing values in non-detected samples were addressed by filling concentrations with medians and uncertainties with 4-fold median uncertainties [ 71 72 4.7. Chronic Exposure Assessment This study employed a dietary exposure assessment model based on subjects’ actual body weights, collecting data on population-specific actual consumption amounts and consumption frequency through questionnaires. Given the highly right-skewed distribution of target contaminant concentrations (Shapiro–Wilk test, p 50 (3) EDI i  =  C i ×  IR i ×  EF i × ED BW × AT C i 50 IR i EF i ED AT 73 This study assessed exposure levels to 21 PFAS congeners and Σ 4 Current internationally adopted PFAS exposure assessment metrics are presented in Table 3 4 (4) HQ = EDI × 7 TWI An HQ value below 1 is considered an acceptable risk. 5. Conclusions This study describes the detection and distribution characteristics of 21 PFAS in commercially available shellfish and crustacean products in Zhejiang, analyzes the sources of PFAS, assesses the long-term dietary exposure risk of Σ 4 Source analysis indicated that crustacean PFAS originate mainly from mixed pollution of chemical industrial discharges and domestic waste, while bivalve contamination relates to short-chain fluorochemical substitutes, industrial atmospheric deposition, and releases from PTFE/PVDF production. Both pathways are co-influenced by historical PFOS production and aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) usage. Chronic dietary exposure assessment indicated low Σ 4 Despite these findings, important knowledge gaps remain regarding the long-term health effects of low-dose exposure to the other 16 PFAS detected at lower levels, as well as their potential combined toxicological effects through synergistic interactions. The widespread detection of PFAS in these seafood products underscores the need for continued monitoring. Future research should focus on three key areas: source apportionment to better identify major contamination pathways, temporal trend analysis to track changes in PFAS levels in relation to industrial activity and regulatory measures, and a comprehensive assessment of combined toxicity effects. This study highlights the critical importance of integrating environmental monitoring with human health risk assessments to develop effective regulatory policies and ensure food safety for consumers. Furthermore, special consideration should be given to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and children, to establish tailored protective measures that safeguard their health. The findings provide valuable baseline data for ongoing surveillance of PFAS contamination in marine food products and contribute to our understanding of exposure risks associated with seafood consumption.
