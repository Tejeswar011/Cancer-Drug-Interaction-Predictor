Current evidence on the interrelationship between periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19 remains insufficient, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate these associations. The main aim of this narrative review is to provide the current landscape of the most relevant aspects of the interrelationship between periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19. This narrative review was carried out through a specialized, exhaustive, and structured search of published studies indexed in the electronic databases PubMed and LILACS, for the inclusion of studies in English and Spanish, respectively, without date restriction. A search strategy was performed using the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT, with the following DeCS/MeSH terms: “periodontal disease”, “periodontitis”, “type 2 diabetes mellitus”, “SARS-CoV-2”, and “COVID-19”. A variety of articles were included, focusing on the most relevant aspects of the interrelationship between periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19. Findings suggest that inflammation is a unifying mechanism, which leads to the severity of these conditions through four shared axes: (1) a clinicopathological axis involving systemic manifestations; (2) an axis associated with metabolic alterations linked to glycemic dysregulation; (3) an axis related to enzyme overexpression linked to altered angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 expression and glucose metabolism; and (4) an inflammatory axis. These synergistic interactions can cause these three diseases to mutually enhance each other, creating a vicious cycle, worsening the patient’s health.

Introduction Periodontal health is defined by the absence of inflammation in periodontal tissues. Under physiological conditions, these tissues maintain an effective immune response against microorganisms present in the oral cavity, thus preserving their functional integrity [ 1 2 3 4 5 Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic syndrome with a complex etiology that encompasses a broad spectrum of genetic, epigenetic, and pathophysiological alterations. These dysfunctions can be significantly modulated by environmental factors, such as infections, diet (quality and quantity of nutrients ingested), and the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota. The interaction between these factors contributes to the development and progression of the disease [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had an unprecedented health impact since its emergence in December 2019. Its rapid spread has led to alarming morbidity and mortality rates worldwide [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 33 2. Materials and Methods This study involved a narrative review, which was carried out according to the following methodology [ 36 Figure 1 2.1. Step 1: Specialized Search An exhaustive and structured search was carried out in the electronic databases PubMed and LILACS, using Boolean operators (AND and/or OR) and DeCS/MeSH controlled terms such as “periodontal disease”, “periodontitis”, “type 2 diabetes mellitus”, “SARS-CoV-2” and “COVID-19”. 2.2. Step 2: Identification of Studies Studies were selected based on previously established eligibility criteria, which considered thematic relevance, quality, and scope for this study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) articles in English or Spanish; (2) no publication date restrictions; (3) studies of the following type or design: clinical trials, observational studies, relevant narrative reviews, systematic reviews, clinical cases; (4) studies addressing comorbidity between periodontitis and T2DM; (5) studies analyzing the relationship between T2DM and COVID-19; (6) studies exploring the association between periodontitis and COVID-19; (7) articles explicitly mentioning the interrelationship between the three pathologies: periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that do not directly address any of the comorbidities; (2) studies of the following type or design: conference abstracts and letters to the editor. 2.3. Step 3: Screening of Studies During this step, duplicate studies were identified and eliminated. Articles were then selected, applying eligibility criteria based on their title and abstract, ensuring their relevance and quality. Studies without access to the full text were eliminated. To facilitate this process, the Rayyan platform was used https://www.rayyan.ai 2.4. Step 4: Inclusion and Analysis of Studies Finally, the studies that had passed the preliminary steps and met all eligibility criteria were retrieved and analyzed in full text. Relevant data were then extracted, and this narrative review was written, integrating the most significant findings regarding the association between periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19. 3. Periodontitis and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Periodontitis has been recognized as the sixth complication of T2DM, due to solid scientific evidence supporting a bidirectional relationship between the two pathologies [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 Figure 2 T2DM is characterized by dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses, even without the presence of external pathogens or antigens [ 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 Current evidence indicates that elevated PMN levels in periodontitis patients show immune dysregulation, which plays a crucial role in the etiology of the disease [ 56 57 58 55 59 60 61 Hyperglycemia also contributes to the development and evolution of inflammation during T2DM, through the activation of various intracellular signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways, resulting in an increase in the production of proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and reactive oxygen species [ 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 2 72 73 74 75 76 77 66 78 Among these proinflammatory mediators, TNF-α, an important pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine [ 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 The NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP)-3 inflammasome, a supramolecular complex [ 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 On the other hand, hyperglycemia and inflammation induce an increase in the production and activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which leads to the destruction of connective tissue and induction of apoptosis in fibroblasts and osteoblasts, thus limiting the repair capacity of periodontal tissues [ 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 4. Periodontitis and COVID-19 At the clinical level, several studies have evidenced an association between periodontitis and adverse outcomes of COVID-19 [ 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 According to current scientific evidence, three main and interrelated mechanisms could explain the association between periodontitis and COVID-19 disease ( Figure 3 132 133 134 Direct contact of SARS-CoV-2 with periodontal tissues 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 139 145 152 153 154 On the other hand, the regulation of the expression of these molecules plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In the oral cavity, periodontal–pathogenic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis 155 145 156 157 158 159 160 Inflammatory response (overexpression of cytokines) 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 162 170 171 33 172 The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in the cytokine storm observed during both COVID-19 and periodontitis [ 173 174 175 176 177 178 172 179 180 181 182 172 162 183 184 185 Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 191 188 197 198 199 192 5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 Patients with T2DM have increased susceptibility to several common infections [ 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 Based on current scientific evidence, the following pathophysiological mechanisms are proposed, which could be associated with the comorbidity and susceptibility of patients with T2DM to adverse outcomes related to COVID-19, and which in turn are interrelated ( Figure 4 Metabolic alterations 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 213 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 Hyperglycemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM, making patients more vulnerable to COVID-19 [ 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 Modification of the expression of enzymes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 31 250 251 252 Immune system alterations and inflammation 233 253 254 255 229 256 257 258 259 260 209 261 262 263 257 264 6. Discussion: Interrelationship Between Periodontitis, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and COVID-19 Current scientific evidence on the interrelationship between periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19 is limited, with only two studies available that jointly address these three pathologies. Bachtiar et al. (2024) evaluated the association between dysbiotic periopathogens and inflammatory initiators and mediators in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes, and observed that patients with periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19 had a positive correlation ( p 265 266 266 Although there is abundant information and scientific evidence on periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19, there is currently insufficient scientific literature addressing the relationship between these three diseases. Therefore, the main aim of this narrative review was to provide the current landscape of the interrelationship between periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19. In the present study, we sought to explain the interrelationship between the following comorbidities: (1) periodontitis and T2DM; (2) periodontitis and COVID-19; and (3) T2DM and COVID-19. Based on the reviewed literature, in addition to the few published scientific studies on the relationship between these three pathologies, we can hypothesize that the three diseases share four important axes ( Figure 5 Clinicopathological axis 38 39 40 41 42 43 117 118 119 120 126 127 128 131 Regarding T2DM and COVID-19, clinical evidence has revealed an increased risk of serious complications when both diseases are present. Patients with this comorbidity (T2DM/COVID-19) tend to experience more severe respiratory problems, a higher incidence of acute complications, impaired kidney function, and worse overall outcomes. This is mainly due to an excessive inflammatory response, which significantly increases the risk of intensive care admission, and the need for mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of death in hospitalized patients with T2DM and COVID-19 [ 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 Axis associated with metabolic alterations 46 62 63 64 65 63 90 47 48 49 103 104 116 57 58 131 155 148 149 150 151 123 124 125 Axis related to enzyme overexpression 145 146 P. gingivalis 155 156 228 229 230 231 232 234 235 236 241 228 246 Inflammatory axis 54 55 66 81 59 61 116 90 101 66 90 101 131 146 145 166 172 170 162 233 254 229 255 256 257 224 262 263 7. Conclusions In conclusion, this comprehensive narrative review reveals the complex network of interactions between periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19, with inflammation emerging as a key factor. The four interconnected axes—(1) a clinicopathological axis; (2) an axis associated with metabolic alterations; (3) an axis related to enzyme overexpression; and (4) an inflammatory axis—have been demonstrated to mutually enhance these three diseases, creating a “vicious cycle”, which worsens the patient’s health. The clinicopathological axis highlights the bidirectional relationship between periodontitis and T2DM, with each exacerbating the other through systemic inflammatory mechanisms. It also highlights how COVID-19 contributes to this interaction, exacerbating both conditions and increasing the risk of serious complications. The metabolic alterations axis delves into the role of hyperglycemia, a hallmark of T2DM, as a key factor in exacerbating inflammation and increasing susceptibility to COVID-19. It describes how hyperglycemia triggers a cascade of events that promote periodontal tissue destruction and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The enzyme overexpression axis focuses on the crucial role of ACE-2 as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the oral cavity. It reveals how hyperglycemia and periodontal–pathogenic bacteria can increase ACE-2 expression, facilitating viral infection and exacerbating the inflammatory response. Together, these axes converge on a crucial axis: systemic inflammation. Inflammation, triggered by periodontitis, exacerbated by hyperglycemia in T2DM, and enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, becomes the main mechanism linking these three conditions. This uncontrolled inflammation leads to an increased risk of serious complications, such as multiple organ failure, severe pneumonia, and mortality. Currently, there is abundant information on these three diseases; however, our understanding of their complex interactions still presents significant gaps, underscoring the need for additional research to clarify this relationship. However, the available information already highlights the crucial importance of understanding these interconnections to develop comprehensive preventive and therapeutic strategies. To achieve this, a multidisciplinary approach bringing together healthcare professionals is required, thereby mitigating the impact of these comorbidities and improving patients’ quality of life.

Figure created with BioRender ( https://www.biorender.com Figure 2 Immunopathological mechanisms in the interrelation between periodontitis and T2DM. The figure represents the bidirectional interrelation between periodontitis and T2DM. The exacerbated inflammatory response in both conditions promotes the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β, which induce insulin resistance, sustained hyperglycemia, and endothelial dysfunction. TNF-α also promotes an increase in endocan, a marker of endothelial activation, exacerbating vascular inflammation. In the periodontal environment, these processes promote the activation of MMP-2, leading to the degradation of periodontal tissues. Furthermore, induction of cell apoptosis and functional inhibition of PMN are observed, compromising the local immune response. These mechanisms generate a vicious cycle that enhances the progression of both diseases. Figure created with BioRender ( https://www.biorender.com Figure 3 Interrelation between periodontitis and COVID-19. The figure illustrates three main mechanisms that explain the relationship between periodontitis and COVID-19: First mechanism: direct entry of SARS-CoV-2 into periodontal tissues through elevated expression of ACE-2. Second mechanism: activation of a shared systemic inflammatory response, with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines that can lead to a cytokine storm. Third mechanism: hyperreactivity of PMN with the formation of NET, contributing to tissue damage and progression of periodontal disease. Figure created with BioRender ( https://www.biorender.com Figure 4 Interrelation between T2DM and COVID-19. The figure illustrates the fact that the interaction between both pathologies is mainly explained by three mechanisms. First mechanism: metabolic alterations, where hyperglycemia favors an environment conducive to the progression of the infection. Second mechanism: modification of the enzyme expression, such as ACE-2, a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Third mechanism: immune system dysfunction and increased systemic inflammation. These processes interrelate, promoting greater susceptibility to severe viral infections and exacerbating the complications associated with both diseases. Figure created with BioRender ( https://www.biorender.com Figure 5 Interrelation between periodontitis, T2DM, and COVID-19. The figure illustrates the complex interplay between these three chronic conditions, which share four important axes: (1) a clinicopathological axis; (2) an axis associated with metabolic alterations; (3) an axis related to enzyme overexpression; and (4) an inflammatory axis.
