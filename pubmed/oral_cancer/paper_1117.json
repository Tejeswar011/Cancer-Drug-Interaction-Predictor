While traditional research has focused primarily on neuronal alterations, emerging evidence underscores the pivotal role of astrocytes, abundant glial cells in the central nervous system, and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in opioid-mediated neuropathology. This review delineates the mechanistic roles of astrocytes and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) across a spectrum of opioids, including morphine, heroin, fentanyl, codeine, tramadol, buprenorphine, and methadone. Opioids disrupt astrocytic homeostasis by impairing glutamate regulation, altering the redox balance, and activating pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. In response, astrocytes release EVs enriched with neurotoxic cargo, including amyloidogenic proteins, cytokines, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs, that propagate neuroinflammation, compromise blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and exacerbate synaptic dysfunction. Preclinical models and in vitro studies reveal drug-specific astrocytic responses and ADEV profiles, implicating these vesicles in modulating microglial function, neuroimmune signaling, and neuronal viability. Notably, morphine-induced ADEVs promote amyloidosis and inflammatory signaling, while heroin and fentanyl affect glutamatergic and inflammasome pathways. Even opioids used in therapy, such as buprenorphine and methadone, alter astrocyte morphology and EV cargo, particularly during neurodevelopment. Collectively, these findings advance a neuro-glial paradigm for understanding opioid-induced brain injury and highlight ADEVs as both biomarkers and mediators of neuropathology. Targeting astrocyte-EV signaling pathways represents a promising therapeutic avenue to mitigate long-term neurological consequences of opioid exposure and improve outcomes in OUD. astrocytes astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (ADEVs) opioid-induced neuropathology neuroinflammation gliosis NIH R21AG069541 RO1DA060755 RO1DA060753 We are thankful to NIH for the funding support: R21AG069541, RO1DA060755, RO1DA060753. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Opioids are a class of potent analgesic compounds that act on the central nervous system (CNS) to aid in pain management, including pre-operative, post-operative, traumatic, and general pain-associated symptomatic care [ 1 2 3 4 Supplementary Table S1 1.1. Opiates, Derivatives and Their Use Originally derived from the opium poppy ( Papaver somniferum 5 6 1 7 8 9 10 11 1.2. Opiate Epidemic Opiate-mediated neurological disorders are broadly discerned as opioid abuse disorders of the brain. However, when the drugs are used in excessive quantities over an optimal threshold in a chronic manner, it leads to drug overdoses, leading to OUDs. OUD encompasses more than 2 million individuals, with more than 100,000 deaths annually in the United States (US) [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 17 23 1.3. Opiates and Mode of Action The effectiveness of opioids in treating acute and chronic pain has resulted in extensive medical applications, such as postoperative, cancer, and palliative care [ 11 24 1 25 26 27 28 29 30 29 31 Prescribing opioids remains a cornerstone of pain management, but the duration of use and the dose prescribed are key determinants of both clinical benefit and potential harm. Although the classification of short and long-term use of opioids based on duration of drug administration does not have an international standard with thresholds, it depends on approximate durations based on each opioid. Short-term opioid use refers to opioid therapy for acute or subacute pain, defined as pain lasting less than one month (acute) or one to three months (subacute), consistent with the 2022 CDC guideline [ 32 33 32 34 35 36 37 38 33 1.4. Physiological Consequences of Opioid Use Chronic opiate use (>3 months) has been associated with alterations in brain structure and function, especially within the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and insula—regions that govern emotional regulation, impulse control, memory, and decision-making [ 39 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 45 46 1.5. Involvement of Astrocytes in Opioid-Use-Disorder Several studies have demonstrated that opioid-led neurological disorders have been the consequence of initial opiate-triggered glial cells like astrocytes and microglia [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 1.6. Role of EVs in Opioid Mediated Neurological Disorders EVs are membrane-enclosed nanoparticles released by nearly all cell types into the extracellular space, where they facilitate intercellular communication by transferring bioactive cargo such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [ 84 85 55 56 86 87 88 89 67 90 91 55 56 55 56 86 92 2. Natural Opioids 2.1. Opium: Natural Origin of Narcotic Alkaloids Opium, a natural alkaloid extracted from the opium poppy ( Papaver somniferum 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 101 103 Recent experimental studies have provided direct evidence that opium exposure affects astrocyte structure and function in the CNS [ 99 109 109 109 99 Although several studies have reported that chronic opium exposure induces astrocyte activation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, the specific role of opium exposure on the composition or function of ADEVs remains largely unexplored. Given that ADEVs are key mediators of glial–neuronal communication and can carry inflammatory mediators, neurotoxic proteins, and regulatory RNAs, understanding their involvement in opioid-induced neuropathology is critical. Elucidating the effects of opium on ADEVs may uncover novel mechanisms by which astrocytes contribute to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline and could provide new therapeutic targets for mitigating the neurotoxic consequences of chronic opioid use. 2.2. Morphine: Natural Opioid Analgesic Morphine is primarily used as an analgesic for the management of moderate to severe pain, but chronic exposure can lead to neurodegeneration, addiction, and molecular alterations. Morphine acts via MORs [ 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 To unravel the neurological effects of morphine, several animal studies were performed. Mechanistically, in a preclinical model of mice administered with systemic morphine (10 mg/kg for 5 days), the mice developed gradual analgesic tolerance, which is associated with astrocytic activation in the midbrain [ 119 119 51 120 121 121 122 56 56 86 55 54 123 2.3. Codeine: Prodrug of Morphine Codeine is a natural derivative of morphine, which is widely used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and cough [ 124 125 126 28 Codeine and its analogs have increasingly been implicated in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes following chronic use [ 127 128 129 130 131 132 3. Semi-Synthetic Opioids 3.1. Heroin: A Semi-Synthetic Derivative of Morphine Among the opioid derivatives available illegally, heroin emerges as a leading psychoactive agent causing morbidity and mortality worldwide. This semi-synthetic opioid heroin is derived from morphine. Heroin profoundly disrupts the CNS, leading to neuroadaptive changes associated with tolerance, dependence, and cognitive impairment. Heroin acts through MORs in the body, with increasing use in the younger population between 18 and 25 years. Reports showed that primary heroin overdose with an estimated one million at risk of developing opioid-use disorders in 2021 alone. In the United States, heroin use disorder exists among youths aged 12 years and older [ 133 134 135 The neurological effects of heroin are accompanied by immunological and cellular changes, particularly through EV-mediated communication that involves the central players like miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [ 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 3.2. Oxycodone: A Widely Used Painkiller Oxycodone is a widely used semi-synthetic opioid for moderate to severe neuropathic pain and has been in clinical use since 1917 [ 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 147 154 155 67 3.3. Hydrocodone: A Safer Alternative to Oxycodone Hydrocodone is an oral semi-synthetic opioid found to be a safer alternative to oxycodone in neuropathic pain. The use of the drug is associated with the risk of developing drug overdose and related deaths [ 156 157 158 159 160 3.4. Oxymorphone: A Metabolite of Oxycodone Oxymorphone is a semi-synthetic opioid that specifically binds to MORs and is used for pain relief in various disease conditions. Unlike oxycodone, oxymorphone does not show binding affinity towards the kappa-opioid receptor [ 161 162 Zhx2 Zhx2 Zhx2 163 3.5. Hydromorphone: High-Potency Pain Reliever Hydromorphone is another semi-synthetic opioid, that is a metabolite of hydrocodone [ 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 168 148 171 Hydromorphone was first made and used in Germany in 1921, followed by its widespread use in the treatment of acute and chronic pain [ 172 173 174 175 176 177 3.6. Buprenorphine: Treatment for Opioid Addiction Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, is one of the primary medications in the treatment of OUD. Buprenorphine is majorly a MOR agonist and antagonist of the kappa and delta receptors [ 178 179 180 Buprenorphine has been shown to induce significant neurodevelopmental alterations via astrocyte-mediated mechanisms, particularly through EV signaling pathways. A pivotal study demonstrated that fetal CNS-derived extracellular vesicles (FCEs), which were extracted from maternal blood, exhibited modified molecular content upon maternal buprenorphine use [ 181 181 182 183 182 4. Synthetic Opioids 4.1. Fentanyl: Major Contributor in the Opioid Crisis Fentanyl is a strong anesthetic cum analgesic compound that is prescribed for severe and chronic pain management. Fentanyl is one of the frontier synthetic drugs contributing to the opioid crisis in recent years [ 184 185 13 186 187 184 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 Further studies on rodents showed that repeated administration with fentanyl activates NLRP3 inflammasome in astrocytes with hyperalgesia as a signature symptom along with other common morphine- triggering symptoms like allodynia [ 195 196 197 2+ 198 192 199 200 4.2. Methadone: A Second Line Option for Neuropathic Pain Methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic and commonly used during pregnancy for pain relief. The drug preferentially binds to MORs and affects mainly the hippocampus region of the brain [ 201 202 203 190 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 4.3. Tramadol: Centrally Acting Synthetic Opioid Analgesic Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic used for moderate to severe pain. Approved in Germany in the late 1970s and by the U.S. FDA in 1995, it is structurally related to codeine. Its dual mechanism—weak MOR agonism and inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake—sets it apart from conventional opioids and underlies its effectiveness in neuropathic pain, where standard opioids often fall short [ 211 212 213 214 Between 2002 and 2013, the age-adjusted mortality rate for overdoses involving tramadol and other synthetic opioids, like fentanyl and fentanyl analogs but excluding methadone, showed minimal change, increasing from 0.4 to 1.0 per 100,000. However, a significant upward trend followed, with the rate climbing to 22.7 by 2022 [ 215 Recent research highlights the impact of tramadol on the CNS beyond its simple receptor-based pain modulation. Particularly, there is growing interest in how tramadol interacts with astrocytes, glial cells crucial for maintaining CNS homeostasis, and how these interactions may involve or be mediated by EVs released by astrocytes. Tramadol, beyond its classical MOR-mediated analgesia, has been shown to induce significant glial responses, especially within astrocytic populations. In an experimental rat model, oral tramadol administration (tramadol HCL 40 mg/kg/day) led to pronounced oxidative stress, activation of the PERK apoptotic pathway, and astrocytic hypertrophy in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. These changes were marked by the appearance of vesicular nuclei and cytoplasmic vacuolization—hallmarks of glial stress and impending apoptosis [ 216 217 218 2 219 4.4. Carfentanil: An Ultra-Potent Synthetic Opioid Carfentanil is an ultra-potent synthetic opioid primarily developed as a veterinary anesthetic for large animals such as elephants, with a potency estimated to be 10,000 times greater than morphine and approximately 100 times more potent than fentanyl [ 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 While direct clinical studies remain limited, recent research highlights the potential neurobiological consequences of carfentanil exposure. A PET imaging study by Shi et al. demonstrated that MOR binding potential, measured using [11C]-carfentanil, was positively associated with cortical thickness across several brain regions in patients undergoing extended-release naltrexone treatment for opioid-use disorder [ 229 230 231 232 233 5. Conclusions Opioid-induced neurological disorders are multifactorial in origin, encompassing neurochemical, structural, and immunological disturbances. The emerging view of astrocytes as central players in these pathologies significantly advances our understanding of how opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, heroin, methadone, and others disrupt CNS homeostasis. Through both cellular reactivity and the secretion of ADEVs, astrocytes orchestrate complex intercellular signaling that influences synaptic plasticity, BBB (BBB) integrity, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration ( Figure 1 Recent experimental findings offer compelling evidence for the drug-specific astrocytic responses. Morphine, for instance, has been shown to trigger region-specific astrocytic amyloid deposition and neuroinflammation in non-human primates and human cell models, with ADEVs carrying amyloidogenic cargo (Aβ, APP) and inflammatory mediators like IL-1β, and regulatory RNAs including miR-138. These vesicles activate TLR7/NF-κB signaling in microglia, suppress phagocytosis, and promote BBB disruption. Notably, studies by Sil et al. and Liao et al. revealed morphine-ADEVs to be potent mediators of BBB disruption, synaptic dysfunction, and impaired microglial phagocytosis—effects that could be reversed by blocking the vesicular miRNAs or their signaling receptors [ 54 56 56 130 131 138 139 140 141 150 151 In the case of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid with extreme potency, its ability to induce astrocytic NLRP3 inflammasome activation and β-arrestin-mediated ERK signaling is noteworthy. These changes are associated with neuroadaptive remodeling, synaptic dysfunction, and even alterations in astrocytic calcium signaling, as seen in co-culture models and rodent cortex studies. Fentanyl’s impact on ADEV cargo, especially miR-190, suggests another layer of regulation affecting MOR expression and opioid tolerance. Methadone, a synthetic opioid used in opioid substitution therapy, demonstrates delayed glial maturation, astrogliosis, and programmed neuronal cell death, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Animal and organoid studies show significant changes in astrocyte regulatory proteins (PEA-15, p-Akt1) and elevation of TNF-α, marking methadone as a critical agent affecting neurodevelopment and adult glial dynamics. Similarly, tramadol, through oxidative stress and activation of the PERK apoptotic pathway, leads to reactive astrocytosis and neurotoxicity—effects attenuated in some models by co-administering melatonin or elderberry extract, highlighting oxidative stress as a modifiable driver of tramadol-induced astrocytic injury. These drug-specific profiles reinforce the concept that astrocytes and ADEVs act as hubs of opioid-induced neuropathology, differentially influenced by drug type, dose, duration, and developmental context. The mechanistic insights discussed in this review are situated within the core of a growing public health crisis. OUD now affects over two million people in the U.S. alone, contributing to more than 100,000 deaths annually. The trajectory from prescription opioid misuse to illicit synthetic opioid use has compounded the challenge. Despite pharmacological diversity, a common astrocytic signature emerges across opioids: glutamate dysregulation, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and vesicle-mediated intercellular toxicity. These shared astrocytic responses provide a unifying framework for understanding the neurodegenerative consequences of chronic opioid exposure. Ongoing research efforts are actively exploring ways to counteract opioid-induced astrocyte dysfunction and its long-term neurological consequences. Several clinical trials and preclinical studies are underway focusing on modulation of glial reactivity using compounds like ibudilast, minocycline, and pioglitazone—agents known to suppress glial inflammation and restore homeostasis [ 234 235 236 123 Future research must pivot toward dissecting the nuanced and drug-specific interactions between opioids and astrocytic EV pathways. One priority area is the temporal and spatial mapping of astrocyte dynamics and ADEVs across various brain regions under different opioid exposures. This includes understanding how acute versus chronic exposure alters the biogenesis, cargo composition, and target specificity of ADEVs. Additionally, investigations should focus on mechanistic regulators of EV release, such as Rab GTPases, ceramide pathways, and sorting complexes like ESCRT, which could be modulated to regulate EV signaling. There is also a compelling case for exploring astrocyte subtype heterogeneity—how distinct astroglial populations (e.g., A1 neurotoxic vs. A2 neuroprotective phenotypes) contribute differentially to EV-mediated neuropathology. Another essential avenue is the identification of circulating EV biomarkers, such as miR-146a-5p, miR-138, and let-7 family members, which show promise in diagnosing opioid exposure and predicting neuroinflammatory burden in both preclinical and clinical settings. Translationally, this knowledge paves the way for glia-targeted therapies, including the delivery of engineered EVs loaded with anti-inflammatory agents or RNA-based therapeutics to reverse maladaptive opioid effects. Intranasally administered EVs, targeting MOR-silencing via siRNA cargo, and small molecules that modulate astrocyte-EV secretion represent cutting-edge strategies under investigation. Furthermore, longitudinal studies combining neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers, and cognitive assessments are essential to validate the causal links between astrocytes, ADEV signaling and long-term opioid-induced brain injury. By shifting from a neurocentric to a neuro-glial framework, future therapeutics may mitigate the neurodegenerative sequelae of opioids more precisely and with fewer side effects than traditional approaches. In summary, astrocytes and their extracellular vesicles are emerging as both biomarkers and effectors in the opioid-induced neuropathological landscape. They offer mechanistic insight into how opioids disrupt brain homeostasis and, simultaneously, therapeutic targets for intervention. Understanding and manipulating this astroglial axis holds transformative potential in addressing the dual crises of chronic pain and opioid addiction in modern medicine.

Activated astrocytes release ADEVs enriched in miR-23a, miR-138, miR-106b, amyloid-β, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), along with dysregulated synaptic regulatory molecules, subsequently promoting microglial activation, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and blood–brain barrier disruption.
