Methods The study encompassed fourteen years, from August 2010 (when the Emergency center was opened) through July 2024, and included referred and self-referred patients with CFP who presented to the neurological ED at the Emergency Center of the UCCV. The exclusion criteria were primary and secondary headaches, other forms of non-neurological orofacial pain (isolated or concurrent), patients younger than 18 years, and reports with insufficient data to provide information about the patient, confirm the diagnosis, and rule out differential diagnosis. All research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institution’s Ethics Committee at the University Clinical Center of Vojvodina (UCCV) in Novi Sad, Serbia (00–58/2022). Due to the retrospective nature of the study, the Ethics committee of the University Clinical Center of Vojvodina waived the need to obtain informed consent. Examination reports were reviewed for demographic data, data regarding the characteristics of pain syndrome, neuroimaging results (conducted during the ED visit or provided by patients), and surgical/invasive or pharmacological treatment. To minimize observer bias, all patient records were initially reviewed independently by Z.B. and S.P. In cases where the diagnosis or classification was unclear, a secondary review was conducted by A.L. and A.K. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved through discussion with other authors until a consensus was reached. This process ensured consistency and reliability in data classification. After review, patients were classified according to their discharge diagnosis. Considering certain diagnostic difficulties in the ED, the authors added the prefix “presumed” to some diagnoses. In the case of presumed occipital neuralgia (pON), it was due to the absence of a confirmatory test (criterion D in ICHD-3), and in the case of presumed persistent idiopathic facial pain (pPIFP) it was due to the unmet pain duration criterion and incompletely excluded alternative diagnoses (criteria B and E according to ICHD3). For presumed trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia (pTN + pGN), criteria B and C were not described in the report. There was no patient or public involvement in the research process. The variable ‘sex’ in this study was determined based on information from medical records, including names and legal identifiers. We did not have access to patients’ self-reported sex or gender identity. As such, the categorization reflects the assigned sex as recorded in legal documents, which may not correspond to patients’ self-identified gender. Patients were divided into four groups based on the disease duration: less than a week, one week but less than three months, three months and up to one year, and more than a year. The course was defined based on Maarbjerg et al. 8 Patients were divided into two groups (pre and post) based on the disease onset relative to the first registered COVID-19 case in Serbia (6th March 2020). This was used for analysis of differences in CFP characteristics. Additionally, patients were grouped according to whether they reported to ED before or after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-COVID-19: August 2010 - March 2020, post-COVID-19: March 2020 - July 2024). This second grouping was used to assess whether COVID-19 had an impact on the frequency of ED visits. The test compared the observed frequency of patients in the pre-COVID-19 period to the expected proportion of 0.69, adjusted for the difference in period duration. After extraction, the data were coded and entered into the database. Statistical processing was performed using the software Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The results are presented by methods of descriptive statistics: frequencies and percentages; median and interquartile range for non-normally distributed data. Data normality was assessed by histogram visual inspection and the Shapiro-Wilk test. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze differences in the frequency of SD in TN patients depending on previous invasive treatment. A binomial test was used to assess the difference in frequency of CFP and TN patients in relation to the first case of COVID-19 in Serbia. The statistical analysis methodology and the results regarding differences between characteristics of CFP diagnosed before and after COVID-19 onset are shown in the Supplementary Data Tables 3–9. The p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Missing data is reported in Supplementary Data Table 1.

A binomial test compared the observed number of CFP patients before (126/156) and after (30/156) the start of the COVID-19 pandemic against an expected distribution, revealing significantly fewer ED visits post-COVID-19 ( p p Trigeminal neuralgia The patients with defined etiology (24.6%) were divided into classical (9.0%), secondary (6.6%), and idiopathic (9.0%). Secondary TN was due to MS in 50.0%, followed by space-occupying lesions (25.0%), while 12.5% had MRI findings suggestive of vasculitis or demyelinating disorder, and 12.5% had postinflammatory trigeminal nerve enlargement. There was a large group of etiologically undifferentiated TN (75.4%). This group included three patients (3.3%) with suspected secondary TN and six patients (6.5%) with suspected idiopathic TN. The distribution of age at presentation (W = 0.951, p p The pain was almost exclusively unilateral (99.2%) and usually affected the V2 (25.4%), V3 (16.4%), or both branches (26.2%) (Tables 1 4 1 6 p 6 Painful trigeminal neuropathy Six patients had painful neuropathy attributed to the Varicella zoster virus (VZV) (54.5%), and 83.3% of them were males. Four patients (36.4%) had posttraumatic neuropathy caused by sinus surgery (2/4) or dental/endodontic treatment (2/4) and were exclusively female. One male patient (9.1%) had a painful TNp due to an invasive space-occupying lesion. The pain was mostly affecting the V1 branch (63.6%) in TNp, attributed to VZV and cancer, or V2 (36.4%) in posttraumatic TNp (Table 4 Presumed persistent idiopathic facial pain Given that none had pain lasting more than three months, the diagnosis was labeled as presumed. The pain was poorly localized and approximated to trigeminal divisions. It affected the middle and lower areas of the face in 50.0%, but occasionally extended to the entire face (25.0%), or neck and shoulder (25.0%) (Table 4 Presumed occipital neuralgia The diagnosis was classified as presumed since none of the patients received nerve blocks. The pain was described as throbbing (40.0%), shock-like (40.0%), stabbing, or pecking (10.0% each). The majority of patients reported pain in the minor occipital nerve division (45.5%), three in the major occipital nerve division (27.3%), one in the auriculotemporal region (9.1%), and one in an unspecified division (9.1%). Glossopharyngeal neuralgia The pain was triggered by swallowing in 75.0% and described as stabbing, sharp, or pulsating (25.0%, respectively). Three patients (75.0%) reported pain in the oropharynx, while one (25.0%) had otic distribution. The etiology was unknown in 50.0%, while VZV and trauma after neck surgery were identified in the other cases (25.0% each). Painful nervus intermedius neuropathy Neuropathy was due to VZV in all cases, and they had already been prescribed acyclovir. Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) was diagnosed in three patients (75.0%) and was left-sided in one case (25.0%). Pain description was provided in one case (25.0%), classified as burning. Presumed trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia The patient was an 86-year-old female who was examined within the first week of symptoms (Table 1 Discussion This 14-year retrospective study examines the neurological ED as an important and challenging setting for diagnosing and managing CFP. In contrast to prior research, which has predominantly explored outpatient populations, or certain CFP and headache subtypes in ED 1 2 8 12 Neurologists in the ED face significant challenges in managing CFP due to the need for a focused but thorough approach 1 3 4 5 10 1 3 5 13 1 5 14 The well-documented female predominance in most CFPs 5 10 15 15 5 Trigeminal neuralgia There is an underutilization of rapid-onset guideline-suggested treatment options for TN in emergency settings, coupled with a high rate of etiologically undefined cases due to diagnostic limitations, necessitating advanced imaging and updated treatment protocols. Clinically established TN was the most common CFP with demographic and clinical characteristics similar to previous reports 3 5 8 16 5 17 Extracting data on SD in TN was challenging due to reporting inconsistencies. Despite this, we noted a high (33.6%) prevalence of SD in patients with typical trigeminal pain, not attributable to previous surgical treatment. This finding is corroborated by previous studies focusing on subclinical SD in idiopathic or classic TN 18 8 5 Distinguishing between TN and TAC can be difficult, especially when pain attacks are accompanied by CAS 4 5 8 5 6 Despite TN being primarily a clinical diagnosis 5 6 16 3 6 17 5 The first-line treatment for TN typically involves pharmacological options like CBZ, or oxcarbazepine, which has a better side-effect profile 3 5 17 19 17 19 17 19 20 16 19 21 17 19 22 Painful trigeminal neuropathy TNp is predominantly VZV related and requires an early intervention in the ED to prevent complications. The diagnosis and treatment were not significantly challenging for neurologists in the ED. The high prevalence of VZV goes in line with the patients’ advanced age and explains the involvement of V1 3 5 6 23 3 5 3 5 Presumed occipital neuralgia pON is likely underdiagnosed in the ED due to the absence of confirmatory nerve blocks, revealing a significant diagnostic shortfall. As the third most frequent CFP in our study, pON is commonly encountered 5 5 6 24 12 5 25 Presumed persistent idiopathic facial pain pPIFP’s rarity and diagnostic complexity in the ED leads to guideline-deviant treatments, underscoring the need for multidisciplinary input. Although PIFP is not neuralgia, these cases highlight the difficulties of diagnosing CFP. The diagnosis requires the exclusion of dental and non-tooth-related orofacial pain, and other neuropathic facial pain (mostly TN) 3 4 26 27 26 28 3 26 27 27 Glossopharyngeal neuralgia GN is more prevalent than previously reported, carries risks of misdiagnosis due to overlap with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and responds well to carbamazepine (CBZ), though diagnostic and management challenges remain. GN is rare, more common in women, usually in their sixth decade 3 5 29 4 29 30 3 5 29 4 31 29 3 4 31 5 29 4 Painful nervus intermedius neuropathy The cutaneous manifestations make the diagnosis of NINp attributed to VZV usually straightforward 14 32 3 Impact of COVID-19 Our study finds a reduced number of CFP patients visiting the ED post-COVID-19, including the TN majority, which likely reflects fewer presentations rather than a decrease in disease incidence or exacerbations. Although a survey by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain suggested an increase in overall referrals for orofacial pain across settings 9 33 34 35 Role of the neurological ED Many patients presented acutely, particularly those with rare conditions other than TN. The neurological ED in our region seems to represent the first or perhaps the second point of contact for these undifferentiated CFP patients. Establishing the correct diagnosis and providing adequate care in ED conditions can be challenging, often interrupted, and time-consuming. Considering that most patients did not require treatment during the examination, this may indicate a need to evaluate possible difficulties accessing the primary and higher outpatient healthcare levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study focusing exclusively on CFP in a neurological ED, in contrast to prior work often limited to general emergency or outpatient settings, or specific conditions like trigeminal neuralgia and headaches. However, several limitations require addressing. As a retrospective study, clinical data were obtained from a non-standardized template, usually lacking a certain proportion of relevant information. Due to the retrospective design and limited documentation in the ED, confounding factors such as comorbidities and socioeconomic variables were not systematically assessed, though this aligns with the study’s focus on clinical description rather than causal analysis. The lack of follow-up after brief encounters in the ED prevents treatment evaluation. A limitation of this study is the small sample size and group sizes, including post-COVID-19 cases ( n n Despite the acknowledged limitations, the extensive duration of this study, involving examinations by 25 neurologists, substantially enhances the clinical value and applicability of our data in the management of CFP in the neurological ED. Furthermore, these findings underscore the considerable challenges inherent in diagnosing and managing CFP within neurological emergency settings, thereby highlighting the critical need for ongoing research to establish evidence-based treatment protocols. Conclusion The demanding clinical environment of the neurological ED complicates the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of CFP. A notable decline in patient presentations to the neurological ED was observed post-COVID-19, likely attributable to external factors such as healthcare avoidance or access constraints. The typical patient was an elderly female with right-sided TN affecting the V2 and V3. Rare CFPs and their combinations can first present in the ED, positioning it as a critical initial or secondary point of contact for these patients. Neurologists generally followed the guidelines in most CFPs, yet updates are needed, particularly in optimizing the rapid-onset acute treatment. To enhance patient care, there is a need for institutional evidence-based guidelines for CFP management and uniform documentation based on ICHD-3 or ICOP.
