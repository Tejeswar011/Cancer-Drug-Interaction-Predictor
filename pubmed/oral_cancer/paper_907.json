Accurate diagnosis and prevention require an interdisciplinary approach that includes both traditional lab tests and modern, non-invasive health assessments. Methods: This study aimed to evaluate metabolic health in adults from the Małopolska Voivodeship by analyzing the relationships between obesity indicators (BMI, waist circumference) and anthropometric, blood, and salivary biomarkers. Sixty-three participants (36 women, 27 men) aged 40–71 underwent body composition analysis (InBody 770), anthropometric measurements, and biochemical tests of blood and saliva. Assessed parameters included body composition (BMI, BFM, FFM, SMM, PBF, VFA, PA), blood pressure, blood biomarkers (glucose, TG, LDL, HDL, HbA1c, insulin, cortisol), and salivary markers (FRAP, DPPH, urea, amylase activity, protein content, pH, buffering capacity). Results: The results showed a strong correlation between body composition and biochemical markers, but the results of the analyzed salivary biomarkers were inconclusive and, in some cases, contradictory to the findings of other authors. Conclusions: Fat mass, cell integrity, and diastolic pressure were key determinants of waist circumference. Our research confirms the validity of using combined diagnostics, bioimpedance, and blood analysis for a comprehensive assessment of metabolic health and indicates the direction for further research using salivary biomarkers. A holistic approach improves risk assessment and strengthens preventive and therapeutic strategies. However, our pilot study showed that the research requires a larger sample size, especially in order to draw representative conclusions regarding salivary biomarkers and their relationship to metabolic health.

Introduction A holistic approach to metabolic health is a comprehensive view of a person that takes into account all aspects of their life and functioning. This makes it possible not only to treat metabolic diseases but also to prevent them and promote overall well-being. The latest literature data point in this direction and place greater emphasis on introducing multidimensional and intensive lifestyle modifications in patients in order to achieve the best clinical responses [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Human body composition primarily consists of adipose tissue (both subcutaneous and visceral), muscle mass, and body fluids. Changes in the proportions of these components depend on various factors, such as age, sex, level of physical activity, and overall health status. In the context of metabolic syndrome, the key indicator is not the total amount of adipose tissue but rather its distribution—especially within the visceral fat compartment, which exhibits strong pro-inflammatory and endocrine activity. Visceral fat releases cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, which impair insulin action and exacerbate insulin resistance, even in individuals with a normal body mass index (BMI) [ 12 13 Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is one of the most commonly used methods for assessing body composition in both clinical and population-based settings. It is based on measuring the resistance and reactance of body tissues in response to a low-intensity electrical current of a specific frequency [ 14 15 16 Traditional therapeutic models that focus on the pharmacological treatment of individual symptoms have proven insufficient in the face of the complex pathophysiology of this syndrome and its strong associations with lifestyle, diet, stress, and the function of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis [ 17 18 19 20 21 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 29 32 33 2. Materials and Methods The study was conducted with the approval of the Bioethics Committee of the Tarnów Academy, No.7/2024 of 13 March 2024. It involved 63 volunteers from the Małopolska region, aged 40–71 (36 women, 27 men). Participants were recruited randomly. Those willing to participate in the study applied for the recruitment process. After meeting the inclusion criteria and confirming the absence of contraindications, they were qualified for the study. All participants gave their informed written consent to participate in the study and to the use of anonymous data for scientific purposes. Anonymity and confidentiality of data were ensured. The study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles. Venous blood and saliva samples were collected from all participants. The inclusion criterion for study participants was an age of not less than 40 and not more than 75 years. Exclusion criteria included: lack of informed consent to participate in the study, diagnosed epilepsy, implanted pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator, metal endoprostheses, and cancer. The research team also informed participants that they could withdraw from the study at any time during its duration. The studies were conducted between July and September 2024 under the same conditions, i.e., in the morning (between 7.30 and 10.00 a.m.), at room temperature, and the participants were fasting. 2.1. Anthropometric Measurements, Blood Pressure Measurement Anthropometric measurements were taken, i.e., height (cm) was measured using a SECA 217 stadiometer (Hamburg, Germany), body weight (kg) using InBody 770 (Seoul, Republic of Korea), and waist circumference (cm) using an ergonomic SECA 203 measuring tape (Hamburg, Germany). Based on the obtained parameters of body height and body weight, BMI was determined. Blood pressure was measured using the HS-50A HONSUN device (Nantong, China). 2.2. BIA Body Composition Analysis Body composition analysis was performed using the InBody 770 multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device (Seoul, Republic of Korea). InBody is a body composition analysis device that provides high measurement accuracy, achieving 98% agreement with DEXA densitometry. The following rules were followed during the analysis: measurements were taken in the morning on an empty stomach; participants did not exercise for at least 10 min before the measurements; they did not shower or use the sauna before the measurements; they were lightly dressed and did not carry any electronic medical devices; they entered the examination with an empty bladder. Before the study began, all participants were thoroughly familiarised with the course and characteristics of the study. The following parameters were measured in the study group: fat-free mass (FFM), body fat mass (BFM), percentage body fat (PBF), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), visceral fat area (VFA), and phase angle (PA) at a frequency of 50 kHz. The BIA measurement was performed in accordance with the protocol recommended by the device manufacturer (in the device manual). The body composition analysis procedure requires the subject to stand barefoot on the platform with their feet placed on the indicated electrodes. After entering the patient’s ID number, a 5-s body weight measurement was started. This was followed by a body composition test, during which participants had to stand with their arms straight and not touching the sides of their body, while holding the electrodes with both hands, such that four fingers covered the lower electrode and the thumb was on the oval electrode. The heel remained aligned with the rear foot electrode, and the thighs did not touch. Participants remained in this position for approximately 2 min until the test was completed. 2.3. Collection of Biological Material Venous blood samples were collected to determine fasting glucose, HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin), insulin, and cortisol concentrations using spectrophotometric methods and ECLIA (Cobas Pro/c503 and e801, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The value of lipid fractions was determined. TC (Total cholesterol), HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein), TG (Triglycerides), calculated parameters, i.e., LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol calculated according to the Sampson-NIH formula, and calculated non-HDL cholesterol (Non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol). Saliva samples were collected using the Salivette method, Sarstedt (Nuembrecht, Germany), to determine biomarkers of oxidative stress, i.e., DPPH, FRAP, urea, buffer capacity, and pH, and salivary amylase activity. Saliva was collected at least 2–3 h after brushing teeth or eating, always between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Saliva was collected in Salivetek tubes, which were then centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rpm at 4 °C using an MPW-350R laboratory centrifuge (MPW Med. Instruments, Warsaw, Poland). The collected saliva supernatant was stored at −60 °C until testing. It should be noted that cortisol exhibits daily fluctuations, which have been taken into account in the methodology for collecting research material. Cortisol reaches its highest concentration in the morning, shortly after waking up (approx. 30–45 min after waking up), i.e., Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)—a rapid increase in concentration. Salivary amylase exhibits a circadian rhythm opposite to that of cortisol, i.e., after waking up, its level is low, and a short decline (“morning dip”) is even observed, and during the day, it gradually increases, reaching its highest values in the evening. 2.4. Determination of pH and Buffer Capacity of Saliva The pH of the saliva supernatant obtained after centrifugation was determined (using the pH meter method with the EUTECH INSTRUMENTS pH 510 pH meter. The method described by Van Nieuw Amerongen et al. [ 34 2.5. DPPH Determination in Saliva The ability of saliva components to reduce free radicals was measured using the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) test. The DPPH solution has a dark purple colour with a maximum absorbance in methanol solution at a wavelength of λ = 514 nm. The DPPH determination involves measuring the change in absorbance, which is proportional to the amount of oxidised DPPH [ 35 % inhibition 0 avg. 0 avg. 0 2.6. Determination of Antioxidant Activity in Saliva Using the FRAP Method The determinations were carried out according to the method of Benzie and Strain [ 36 3+ 2+ 2+ 2.7. Determination of Salivary Amylase Activity Ready-made liquid reagent kits (CNPG3), cat. no. A7564, (Pointe Scientific, Inc., Canton, MI, USA) were used to determine salivary amylase activity. The change in absorbance at a wavelength of 405 nm was measured at 1 min, 2 min, and 3 min, and then the salivary amylase activity over time was calculated on this basis. 2.8. Determination of Urea Concentration in Saliva Urea measurements were performed using kit no. B7552 from Pointe Scientific on NUNC 96-well plates in two replicates. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of λ = 340 nm using a UV5100 spectrophotometer (Biosense Laboratories AS, Bergen, Norway). The amount of urea in saliva was calculated based on the calibration curve. 2.9. Statistical Analysis and Other Software To investigate the relationship between metabolic markers and obesity indicators (BMI and waist circumference), analyses were carried out in several steps. In the first stage, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with 10-fold cross-validation was applied, with predictors standardized within each fold. This procedure reduced the candidate set to non-collinear markers with the greatest informational value. The optimal penalty parameter (α) was chosen by minimizing the mean squared error. Based on the coefficient paths, variables that retained non-zero values were identified and carried forward for subsequent modeling. Next, to quantify associations, multiple linear regression models were constructed using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, including the predictors selected by LASSO. All models were estimated with HC3 heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors to ensure valid inference even in the presence of deviations from classical OLS assumptions. Model diagnostics included the following procedures: (1) multicollinearity was evaluated using variance inflation factors (VIFs), with a threshold value of 5 as the primary reference. All included predictors had VIF < 2, indicating no redundancy. VIF quantifies the degree of collinearity among predictors: values close to 1 denote independence, whereas values above 5 (and particularly above 10) are generally considered problematic; (2) influential observations were assessed using Cook’s distance, with the conventional cutoff of 4/n. Observations flagged above this threshold were assessed for their potential impact on model stability, and robustness was evaluated by comparing estimates with and without such cases. Cook’s distance thus provides a measure of how strongly individual data points affect regression coefficients; (3) heteroskedasticity was tested using the Breusch–Pagan test, reporting both the LM statistic and F statistic with corresponding p p 2 2 p Pearson’s correlation coefficients ( r p All analyses were performed in Python (version 3.11.13) using standard scientific libraries: numpy pandas matplotlib scikit learn statsmodels The graphic abstract was developed using licensed resources from MindtheGRAPH, in accordance with the terms of use. 3. Results The results indicate significant correlations between body composition, biochemical parameters, and saliva biomarkers among the study group, which consisted of individuals with the characteristics listed in Table 1 3.1. BMI Model—Body Composition Parameters This model aimed to identify which body composition metrics and blood pressure values were significantly associated with variation in BMI among the study participants. Initially, eight variables were considered: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), BFM, FFM, SMM, PBF, VFA, and PA at 50 kHz. LASSO with 10-fold cross-validation (standardization inside each fold) identified three non-redundant predictors out of eight of BMI at the optimal penalty α* = 0.2196: BFM (kg), FFM (kg), and PA (50 kHz). The coefficient-path plot shows that as regularization relaxes, these three coefficients emerge from zero and remain positive at α*, while collinear alternatives (PBF, VFA, SMM) are shrunk to zero ( Figure 1 To verify that the final three-predictor model is not compromised by residual multicollinearity, VIFs were computed from an OLS refit: BFM = 1.057, FFM = 1.591, PA = 1.622. VIFs confirm that the features selected by LASSO have low redundancy and are stable. An ordinary least squares model was estimated using the three LASSO-retained predictors: BFM (kg), FFM (kg), and PA (50 kHz) with HC3 heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors (n = 63). Model fit was strong (R 2 2 2 2 2 Table 2 Table 2 p p p These findings reinforce the central role of body composition, especially FM, in determining body weight. Moreover, PA appears to serve as a meaningful indicator of metabolic and functional health status, reflecting cell integrity and overall tissue quality. 3.2. Waist Circumference Model—Body Composition Parameters This model was developed to determine which body composition indicators and blood pressure values significantly contribute to variation in waist circumference among the study participants. The predictors included BFM, PA (measured at 50 kHz), and both systolic and diastolic BP. To evaluate potential collinearity, VIFs were computed. All predictors showed values well below the conventional cutoff of 5, confirming that multicollinearity is not a concern. Specifically, the VIF was 2.485 for systolic BP, 2.648 for diastolic BP, 1.170 for body fat mass, and 1.123 for PA. Then, influence diagnostics were implemented. Cook’s distance, using the conventional cutoff 4/n = 0.0635, flagged five potentially influential observations (Cook’s D up to 0.099). These cases were removed, and a new OLS model was estimated on n = 58 with HC3-robust standard errors. The Cook’s distance screen and refit were performed to ensure that results were not driven by a small number of influential cases. The final OLS model showed moderate performance (R 2 2 Table 3 These results highlight body fat mass, cellular integrity (as reflected by PA), and systolic BP as key determinants of abdominal obesity. As such, these indicators may serve as useful markers for evaluating metabolic risk in adult populations. 3.3. BMI Model—Blood-Based Parameters This model was designed to examine which selected blood biomarkers and blood pressure measurements significantly contribute to variability in BMI. LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation was applied to identify predictors of interest. At the optimal penalty (α* = 0.165), six variables were retained: glucose, HbA1c, insulin, cortisol, triglycerides, and diastolic BP. Other candidates, such as uric acid and systolic BP, were reduced to zero and excluded from the final specification model ( Figure 2 As a next step, Cook’s distance was computed to detect influential observations. Using the conventional cutoff 4/n = 0.0635 (n = 63), five cases exceeded the threshold, with Cook’s D values reaching up to 0.57. These observations were excluded prior to refitting the final OLS model (resulting n = 58) to ensure that the results were not driven by a small number of influential cases. The final OLS model explained a substantial share of BMI variability (R 2 2 Table 4 In summary, this model identified insulin and diastolic BP as significant and positive predictors of BMI. Among all examined parameters, insulin demonstrated the strongest effect, underscoring its key role in the development of overweight and metabolic syndrome. 3.4. Waist Circumference Model—Blood-Based Parameters To evaluate the contribution of blood biomarkers and blood pressure values to abdominal fat distribution, eight candidate predictors were considered: glucose, HbA1c, insulin, cortisol, uric acid, TG, systolic BP, and diastolic BP. LASSO feature selection with 10-fold cross-validation (standardization within folds) was applied to this set. In the coefficient-path plot (optimal penalty α* = 0.2933), seven variables retained non-zero coefficients: glucose, HbA1c, insulin, uric acid, TG, systolic BP, and diastolic BP. Cortisol was reduced to zero, indicating no unique contribution once the other predictors were included ( Figure 3 After LASSO selected glucose, HbA1c, insulin, uric acid, triglycerides, systolic BP, and diastolic BP, potential influence was evaluated using Cook’s distance. With the conventional cutoff of 4/n = 0.0635, three observations exceeded the threshold, indicating possible undue leverage. These cases were removed, and the model was re-estimated on n = 60 using HC3 heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. The refitted model produced results consistent with the full-sample estimates, confirming that the main findings were not driven by a small number of influential observations. The final OLS model, including the seven predictors retained by LASSO, showed satisfactory performance, explaining a meaningful proportion of the variance in abdominal fat distribution (R 2 2 Table 5 p p 3.5. Correlations of Salivary Biomarkers with Anthropometric and Blood Parameters To explore the potential interrelationships between salivary markers and systemic metabolic status, we examined their correlations with BMI, waist circumference, and selected biochemical blood parameters. The correlation analysis revealed weak positive associations of BMI with amylase (r = 0.27) and FRAP (r = 0.26), as well as a weak negative correlation with DPPH (r = −0.25). No other significant associations between BMI and salivary biomarkers were observed ( Figure 4 The correlation analysis showed a weak positive association of waist circumference with amylase (r = 0.26). No other salivary parameters were significantly correlated with waist circumference ( Figure 5 The correlation analysis revealed only a few statistically significant associations between salivary parameters and blood biochemical markers. Cortisol showed a weak positive correlation with DPPH (r = 0.26), while triglycerides correlated weakly and positively with amylase (r = 0.25). In contrast, glucose, HbA1c, insulin, and uric acid did not show significant associations with any of the salivary biomarkers, and the remaining correlations were negligible and non-significant ( Figure 6 4. Discussion The current definition of MetS, developed in 2022 by a consortium of Polish scientific societies, including the Polish Society of Hypertension, the Polish Society for the Treatment of Obesity, the Polish Lipidology Society, the Polish Hepatology Society, the Polish Society of Family Medicine, the Polish Society of Lifestyle Medicine, and the Prevention and Epidemiology Sections of the Polish Cardiac Society, the ‘Club 30’ of the Polish Cardiac Society, and the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Section of the Polish Society of Surgeons, adapts the previous criteria to the clinical reality in Poland. The diagnosis of MetS is based on the fulfilment of two of the following conditions: 1. Obesity as a prerequisite: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 2. Presence of at least two of the following three factors: - Carbohydrate metabolism disorders: Fasting glucose concentration ≥ 100 mg/dl or glucose concentration ≥ 140 mg/dl after 120 min in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 5.7% or use of hypoglycaemic treatment. - Elevated blood pressure: ≥130/85 mmHg in a doctor’s office or ≥130/80 mmHg at home or use of antihypertensive treatment. - Atherogenic dyslipidaemia: non-HDL cholesterol concentration ≥ 130 mg/dl or use of lipid-lowering treatment [ 5 37 38 39 40 41 41 42 BMI and waist circumference are effective predictors of carbohydrate metabolism disorders [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 47 p 49 37 50 44 51 52 53 Overweight and obesity are undeniable risk factors for hypertension, and an increase in BMI clearly affects blood pressure. The link between obesity and high blood pressure is well known, and it is estimated that obesity accounts for 65–78% of cases of primary hypertension [ 54 55 56 57 58 37 The DPPH and FRAP methods are used to assess the ability of saliva to reduce free radicals and the total antioxidant capacity in saliva, which may be helpful in monitoring the oxidative status in patients with metabolic syndrome. Obesity is characterised by the accumulation of excessive fat and is associated with the risk of metabolic disorders and the occurrence of pathological conditions related to oxidative stress. Salivary oxidative biomarkers, i.e., the antioxidant capacity of saliva, FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power), appear to be impaired in overweight/obese individuals. The results of the study indicated that FRAP antioxidant activity was positively correlated with BMI, which may be associated with increased oxidative stress in individuals with higher body weight. The result is consistent with the study by Chielle et al., where individual saliva markers, including FRAP, and serum levels of ferric-reducing antioxidant power were significantly higher in the obese group compared to individuals of normal weight, indicating an adaptive antioxidant response to increased oxidative stress [ 59 59 60 26 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 In the study, saliva buffer capacity was negatively correlated with BMI. Individuals with lower buffering capacity may have had higher BMI, potentially reflecting metabolic or dietary changes. Measuring urea in saliva (saliva urea) is less common than measuring urea in blood (BUN—blood urea nitrogen), but urea in saliva is a potential non-invasive alternative biomarker [ 73 74 74 75 76 26 Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic syndrome may contribute to the development of cancer, but the causal relationship remains unclear. Recent studies show a positive causal relationship between genetically predisposed metabolic syndrome and the development of many cancers. Studies by Qian Wand et al. [ 77 8 78 79 80 81 82 5. Conclusions All models demonstrated statistically significant fit, although their predictive strength and clinical utility varied substantially: The BMI model based on InBody parameters showed the highest explanatory power (R 2 2 The waist circumference model using InBody data showed moderate effectiveness (R 2 2 The blood-based BMI model explained a significant portion of BMI variability (R 2 2 The waist circumference model based on blood parameters (R 2 2 5.1. Most Accurate Predictive Model The BMI—InBody model (R 2 2 5.2. Most Clinically Relevant Model for Metabolic Syndrome The blood-based BMI model (R 2 2 The waist circumference, blood model (R 2 2 Taken together, these results suggest that InBody-derived body composition measures, particularly BFM and PA, offer the strongest prediction of BMI. In parallel, the blood-based model featuring insulin, HbA1c, and diastolic BP best captures the key metabolic components typically seen in central obesity and metabolic syndrome. The use of combined diagnostic methods—BIA analysis and blood biochemistry enables a comprehensive assessment of metabolic health. Saliva biomarkers appear to be promising. A holistic approach can increase the accuracy of risk assessment and the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic measures. Although the results seem promising, they should be treated with caution given the exploratory nature of the study. They provide a starting point for further analysis using additional factors, i.e., behavioral, dietary, and sociodemographic variables in a larger population, in order to draw clear conclusions. 6. Limitations The presented study has several significant limitations. First, the size of the study sample is related to the pilot nature of the study and served to formulate preliminary observations and set the direction for future, large-scale studies with sufficiently high analytical power. Second, the saliva biomarkers used, although promising due to their non-invasiveness and innovative application, may be subject to daily fluctuations (e.g., salivary amylase) and individual variability. Despite the standardization of the time of sample collection, their predictive value in the context of metabolic risk assessment requires further validation. The cross-sectional nature of the study makes it impossible to determine causal relationships between the analyzed variables, such as BMI, PA, and biological marker levels. In addition, the interpretation of the results is complicated by the inconsistency of the literature data, particularly with regard to the relationship between BMI and PA. These differences may result from the different characteristics of the study populations, the measurement methods used, and the clinical context. Unlike many previous clinical studies, our sample included a randomly selected general population. Despite the above limitations, the results obtained provide valuable exploratory information that should be verified in future studies involving larger research groups. 7. Directions for Future Research This exploratory study indicates the potential usefulness of PA and salivary biomarkers in assessing metabolic risk. However, further research is needed to verify and expand on the results obtained. Future research directions should include larger study samples and demographically diverse groups to increase the generalizability of the results. Longitudinal studies are particularly needed to assess the causal relationships between body composition, metabolic markers, and saliva parameters. Standardizing saliva collection procedures will be crucial for reducing measurement variability and observing other relationships. It is also worth further analyzing the role of PA as a potential indicator of metabolic status in different BMI categories. If its usefulness is confirmed, both PA and non-invasive saliva markers may be used in risk screening and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions in people at risk of metabolic syndrome. The integration of holistic saliva diagnostics with other methods, such as nutritional assessment, monitoring of physical activity, psychophysical condition, environmental conditions, and biochemical profiling, may contribute to the development of personalized strategies for the prevention and treatment of population-based diseases in the future.
