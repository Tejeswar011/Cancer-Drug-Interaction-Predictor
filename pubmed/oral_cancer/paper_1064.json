Introduction The overarching concept of brain health includes numerous functions, such as anxiety, depression, mood, cognition, and well-being. Deterioration of brain health contributes to the development of psychiatric conditions and cognitive decline, which can greatly impact quality of life. Emerging research suggests mushrooms, unique in nutritional value, may be important modulators in the prevention of various brain health diseases [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Mushrooms, identified as vegetable but biologically classified as fungi, have many brain health-promoting compounds [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Some epidemiological studies and randomized controlled trials suggest a potential association or causal link between mushroom consumption, either as a supplement or part of a healthy diet, and brain health. Findings from epidemiological studies indicate improvements in depressive symptoms and decreases in mild cognitive impairment in Asian individuals who self-reported >30 g serving and >2 servings/week, respectively, of any variety of mushroom as part of a health-promoting diet [ 15 16 Hericium erinaceus 17 18 19 20 In addition to their many bioactive compounds, mushrooms contain ergosterol, a predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes that undergoes photolysis upon ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, converting into ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2 21 22 23 24 2 25 26 27 The purpose of this research was to assess the effects of consuming UV light-exposed mushrooms on indices of perceived anxiety, depression, mood, cognition, and well-being. While vitamin D 2 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Design This study employed a randomized parallel design with 41 adults (19 M/22 F, age 43 ± 11 y; BMI 29.8 ± 5.9 kg/m 2 Agaricus bisporus Figure 1 3 Prior to participant recruitment, the Purdue University Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol (IRB 2022-750), and it was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT05559112 2.2. Participant Inclusion Criteria Male and female volunteers (30–69 y) with overweight or obesity (25.0–34.9 kg/m 2 Research coordinators used a variety of recruitment strategies, including physical fliers, announcements on Purdue University’s daily email newsletter, and a partnership with Trialfacts, a company based in Melbourne, Australia, that specializes in participant recruitment services and advertisement. Additionally, consented individuals from previous studies in a participant database were also asked about potential interest. 2.3. Study Intervention and Dietary Assessment During the intervention, participants in both groups consumed their habitual, self-chosen diets. Participants randomized to the Mushroom group were instructed to consume fresh mushrooms (168 g/d, 7 d/wk) intended to contain 400 IU/serving (800 IU/d) vitamin D 2 n Self-reported adherence to consuming the interventions was assessed using data from an online Qualtrics survey participants completed daily. In this survey, participants were asked whether they consumed their required amounts for the day and prompted to answer additional questions helpful for the researchers (i.e., if the participant was experiencing an illness, upset stomach, gassy symptoms, medication changes, etc.). Participants had consistent communication with the study coordinators through email conversations and weekly weigh-ins when they picked up their mushrooms or breadcrumbs. The Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24; version 2022, developed by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institute of Health) was used to estimate their daily food consumption. Each participant completed 1 assessment at baseline and the remaining 2 assessments on nonconsecutive random weekdays and weekend days during the intervention. Dietary intake data were used to calculate participants’ Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores to assess diet quality and consistency during the intervention and to demonstrate that our participant’s dietary patterns were generally consistent with those of the broader US population. 2.4. Clinical Assessments For baseline and week-6 testing visits, participants came to the Purdue University clinical research facility following a 10 h overnight fast. Participants first weighed themselves in a private room with minimal clothing items to their comfort level to obtain the most accurate measurement. Participant’s heights were also measured at baseline and week 6 visits. Body weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 2 3 Assessments included General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Profile of Mood States Short-Form (POMS-SF), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF36v2). 2.4.1. Assessment of Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized anxiety disorder-7, a 7-item measure, was utilized to assess the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. The participant was asked to respond to each item to indicate the severity of potential symptoms over the previous 2 weeks [ 28 29 29 2.4.2. Assessment of Symptoms of Depression Participants completed two measures for assessing symptoms of depression—BDI and PHQ-9. The BDI is a 21-item self-report inventory measuring the intensity of depression symptoms over the previous 2 weeks [ 30 31 Supplementary to the BDI, the PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-reported measure for major depressive disorder over the previous 2 weeks and asks individuals how disrupting symptoms are to their daily functioning. The PHQ-9 is deemed a valid measure of depression severity with high reliability [ 32 2.4.3. Assessment of Mood Participants’ moods were evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS), a 37-item self-report survey that measures Total Mood Disturbance with 6 subscales (depression, vigor, confusion, tension, fatigue, and anger). Mood-related adjectives were presented and participants indicated the severity to which adjectives describe themselves during the past week. Ratings are collected using a Likert-type scale ranging from “0-not at all” to “4-Extremely”. The POMS is a widely used tool for assessing psychological distress [ 33 2.4.4. Assessment of Perceived Quality of Life Self-perceived health status was assessed using the self-reported Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36v2). Participants rated their level of agreement with various health-related statements. The SF-36v2 scoring is based on 8 scales: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to physical problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health. 2.4.5. Neuropsychological Assessment The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Update, Forms A and B, was used to assess cognitive function [ 34 35 2.5. Statistical Analysis All outcome data were entered independently twice and cross-checked. Data were analyzed according to a pre-specified plan, ensuring analysts remained blinded to the intervention status until all analyses were finalized. Descriptive statistics and bivariate associations among study variables were examined using SPSS (v. 29, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality were assessed, and no violations were detected in any of the analyses. The primary analyses were performed as multiple two-way repeated measures analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) to determine whether mushroom consumption affected changes in brain and metabolic health outcomes. Sex was included as a covariate in all models due to its potential influence on the measured outcomes [ 36 3. Results 3.1. Participants Study coordinators were in contact with 382 interested individuals during the clinical testing period (late autumn to late winter 2022–2023 and 2023–2024). Of the 382 individuals, 43 people were randomized to either Mushroom ( n n Figure 2 n Table 1 3.2. Dietary Assessment and Adherence to the Dietary Intervention Thirty-nine participants completed the self-reported ASA24 food logs for calculating HEI-2015 scores. Mean HEI scores were calculated for each individual group and combined at baseline, during the intervention, and overall ( Table 2 Dietary adherence to the intervention calculated based on the number of days participants self-reported adherence or non-adherence over the number of days they were in the study. The average adherence to consuming the assigned interventions across all participants was 97% (96.6% in the Mushroom group and 97.7% in the Control group). 3.3. Anxiety and Depression There were no differential changes in anxiety scores as assessed by GAD-7 after consumption of the mushrooms in any of the analyses. Independent of mushroom consumption, Beck’s Depression Inventory scores decreased (improved) over time ( p Table 3 3.4. Mood There were no changes in any of the mood outcomes (depression, vigor, confusion, tension, fatigue, and anger) assessed via the Profile of Mood States ( Table 4 3.5. Perceived Quality of Life There were no changes in any of the wellbeing outcomes (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical or emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional wellbeing, and general health) assessed via the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) ( Table 5 3.6. Neuropsychological Function There were no changes between groups in any of the cognitive outcomes (immediate memory, visuospatial construction, language, attention, and delayed memory) assessed via RBANS ( Table 6 p p 4. Discussion The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of incorporating UV light-exposed whole mushrooms into the diet, as a food-based intervention, compared to a non-mushroom control. While vitamin D 2 20 27 A. bisporus The only other study, to our knowledge, investigating the effects of vitamin D-enriched mushrooms (100 mg white button capsules with 300 IU vitamin D 2 3 27 3 37 38 39 38 37 39 20 40 20 The current study indicated no improvements in cognitive function after consuming UV light-exposed mushrooms, which is partly inconsistent with previous research. Researchers from one study indicated that consumption of 5 g muffins (2 x/d) formulated with lion’s mane powder does not influence cognitive function in non-clinical young adults [ 41 37 18 17 Strengths of the present study include the use of a randomized, controlled study design. There was high adherence to the intervention (97% self-reported mean adherence to consuming the assigned intervention) and low drop-out percentage (<5%). Our study design considered confounding factors from participants’ daily living, including maintaining habitual exercise and diet and discontinuing vitamin D supplements. If participants were taking a high dose of vitamin D (>600 IU and <3000 IU) prior to joining the study, they underwent a brief washout period (~4 weeks) before beginning the intervention. Additional steps were taken to reduce risk of bias, including de-identification of data, double data entry, and cross-checking. Statistical analysts were blinded to group assignments. A limitation of the present study was the inability to blind both participants in the intervention group and research coordinators due to the nature of the intervention. However, participants in the Control group remained blinded, as the intervention could plausibly be delivered in powdered form. Future studies would be helpful to investigate the effects of mushrooms in individuals with declining cognition or diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Only 3 mushroom studies [ 17 42 43 Ganoderma lucidum 42 17 43 27 5. Conclusions In conclusion, UV light-exposed cremini mushrooms consumed for 6 weeks did not influence anxiety, depression, mood, cognitive function, or well-being in healthy (non-clinical) middle-aged and older adults. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of whole, UV light-exposed mushrooms on brain health outcomes, adding valuable evidence to a limited body of research. Despite strong adherence and a controlled study design, the lack of observed benefits suggests that UV light-exposed mushrooms may not confer additional cognitive or mood-related advantages in already healthy populations over a short intervention period.
