Methods A total of 224 adult women were recruited during outreach events in three Rorya District villages of Burere, Nyambogo, and Roche in July 2023. Clinical oral examinations were conducted alongside biomarker analysis using the PerioMonitor™, as well as survey-based assessments, including the Oral Health–Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) scale and the Hologic Global Women's Health Index (HGWI). A subsample of 45 participants underwent additional screening for blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose levels. Results Only 18.2% of participants reported having received prior BP screening. The mean DMFT score was 5.16, and 40% of the sample showed elevated periodontal inflammation. The average OHRQoL score was 11.15, indicating substantial functional and psychosocial impacts. Among those screened further, 49% were hypertensive, 2% were hyperglycemic, and 18% were hypoglycemic, most without a prior diagnosis. Conclusions Community-based screening proved both feasible and impactful, uncovering overlapping burdens of untreated oral disease, metabolic dysregulation, and unmet preventive care. These findings reflect the structural and clinical dimensions of oral health inequity and align with syndemic theory, underscoring the need for integrated, gender-responsive, and culturally grounded interventions. They also offer a foundation for scalable, sustainable models of care in low-resource settings. oral-general health oral health global oral health oral health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) women's health The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Progress toward maternal health targets, including Sustainable Development Goal 3.1, remains limited ( 13 14 15 In response, this study applies a syndemic framework to examine the interconnected burdens of oral disease, metabolic risk, and gender-based disparities in rural Tanzania. Syndemic theory underscores how co-occurring health conditions, shaped by structural and social inequities, interact to intensify vulnerability in marginalized populations. Drawing on three years of community-based research in the Rorya District, we integrate clinical dental assessments, biomarker screening, and validated survey tools to generate localized, multidimensional data. We aim to inform culturally responsive, equity-oriented interventions and support more inclusive health planning in underserved settings. Background Oral health is essential to overall well-being, enabling daily functions such as eating, speaking, and socializing without pain ( 16 20 21 22 23 To assess oral health status, this study builds upon previous qualitative research ( 22 24 25 26 In addition to oral health and biomarker assessments, this study includes screening for hypertension and diabetes, two common yet frequently undiagnosed NCDs in sub-Saharan Africa ( 24 27 Methods Study design This cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2023 across the three rural villages of Burere, Nyambogo, and Roche in the Rorya District of Tanzania. Data collection was conducted in collaboration with the Village Life Outreach Project (VLOP) and local Tanzanian health partners, including the Roche Health Center and SHED (Supporting Health and Education in the District) sites. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Cincinnati (Protocol No. 2022-0332) and the review board of SHED. Ethical considerations Particular care was taken to address ethical and cultural considerations, especially given the possibility of uncovering undiagnosed conditions such as hypertension or abnormal glucose levels. When such findings occurred, participants were respectfully informed and referred to the nearest health facility in accordance with local protocols. Informed consent procedures were adapted to the local context to ensure clarity and comprehension in a low-literacy setting. Consent was obtained both verbally and in writing, with information presented in participants' preferred language (Swahili or English) using plain language and visual aids as needed. Trained bilingual researchers facilitated the consent process, ensuring that participants had ample opportunity to ask questions. These procedures reflect a commitment to ethical and reflexive research conduct that prioritizes participant well-being, autonomy, and dignity in resource-limited environments. Sampling and recruitment A total of n 28 Measures Oral health was assessed through clinical examinations and self-reported surveys, while PerioMonitor™ data quantified neutrophil levels in oral rinse as a biomarker of subclinical periodontal inflammation. Moderate-to-high inflammation was defined by a PerioMonitor™ score ≥2. Neutrophil activity was visually interpreted based on a colorimetric shift on the test strip, ranging from light pink (low activity) to deep purple (high activity), corresponding to established markers of periodontal disease. Clinical examinations were conducted by calibrated examiners using a mouth mirror and dental probe under natural or artificial lighting. Oral disease burden was measured using the DMFT Index, where a score ≥5 indicates poor oral health ( 29 30 BP was measured following a five-minute seated rest using a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, with hypertension defined according to American Heart Association guidelines (≥130/80 mmHg or current antihypertensive use) ( 31 32 Data analysis and management All data were de-identified and securely managed to protect participant confidentiality. Paper-based survey responses and clinical data were manually entered into Microsoft Excel ( 33 Descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant demographics, clinical indicators, and survey responses. Frequencies and proportions were calculated for categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were computed for continuous variables, including DMFT indices, BP, blood glucose levels, and OHRQoL scores.

Discussion This study provides novel insights into the intersection of oral health, NCDs, and women's health in a rural East African context. A pronounced pattern of clustered vulnerability emerged, with over 80% of participants meeting clinical thresholds for high oral disease burden. Within this group, a subset also presented with both elevated blood pressure and abnormal glucose levels, signaling an increased risk for adverse long-term health outcomes. Despite the application of appropriate statistical methods for each comparison, including both parametric and non-parametric approaches to address data distribution concerns, no statistically significant associations were identified between the examined variables and oral health outcomes in this study population. However, high OHRQoL scores illustrate the significant functional and psychosocial burden associated with poor oral health. When considered alongside elevated neutrophil levels, these findings point to shared inflammatory pathways linking oral disease with systemic conditions such as cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The convergence of these burdens, compounded by social disadvantage, reflects a syndemic pattern, wherein co-occurring conditions interact synergistically to worsen health outcomes. Consistent with broader regional trends across sub-Saharan Africa, engagement with preventive care was notably low. Fewer than one in five participants had received a blood pressure screening in the past year, despite nearly half of those screened being hypertensive. One in five also exhibited abnormal glucose levels, most without a prior diagnosis, indicating possible undernutrition or undetected metabolic fragility. Participants without recent preventive care were more likely to report poor oral health, including higher DMFT scores, greater periodontal inflammation, and elevated systolic blood pressure. Likewise, findings from the HGWI revealed persistent gaps in women's health, particularly in access to preventive services and routine screenings. Barriers to dental care, including limited-service availability and ongoing reliance on traditional oral hygiene practices, mirror structural challenges shaped by urbanization and constrained diagnostic infrastructure. These disparities can reflect entrenched inequities in access and underscore the continuing challenges of gender equity and empowerment in low-resource settings. Such gaps not only delay early detection and treatment but also perpetuate cycles of preventable disease and unmet health needs. Although this study builds on prior qualitative research ( 22 Collectively, results from the current study and similar research ( 22 Limitations Although the study identified patterns suggesting a convergence of oral disease, inflammatory burden, and metabolic dysregulation among socially and educationally disadvantaged women, its findings are constrained by several limitations. The sample size ( n n Conclusion Despite a high burden of untreated dental caries and periodontal inflammation, access to oral care remains limited in low-resource settings. This study demonstrates the feasibility and value of integrating biomarker-based diagnostics and multidimensional assessments into routine community health outreach. In particular, the novel application of PerioMonitor™ enabled early detection of subclinical inflammation, as evidenced by elevated neutrophil counts even among asymptomatic individuals. These results underscore the importance of early intervention strategies and highlight the urgent need for integrated, community-based approaches to oral health in rural Tanzania. Findings from survey tools such as the OHRQoL and HGWI reveal that women experiencing poor health in one domain often face challenges in others, reflecting interconnected risks shaped by gender-related factors. The convergence of limited access to care, high rates of undiagnosed hypertension, abnormal glucose levels, and significant oral disease illustrates a syndemic pattern of clinical and structural vulnerability. These overlapping burdens emphasize the need for holistic, gender-sensitive care models that are responsive to the lived experiences of women in rural, low-resource settings. While this research establishes that community-based screening in underserved settings is both feasible and impactful, it also lays the groundwork for developing scalable, sustainable models of care that integrate clinical services with meaningful community engagement. Expanding integrated screening approaches in low-resource contexts holds the potential to reduce health disparities, enable earlier detection of disease, and promote oral health equity. Future research efforts should prioritize larger, more representative samples to support multivariable and longitudinal analyses. At the same time, policy and programmatic initiatives should aim to decentralize diagnostic services and promote culturally grounded care that incorporates gender-responsive messaging. To support integrated, sustainable care delivery, prevention strategies must embed routine oral and NCD screening, such as blood pressure, glucose, and periodontal inflammation assessments, into existing primary care and community health platforms. This could be achieved by training frontline health workers in basic screening protocols, equipping mobile clinics with low-cost diagnostic tools like the PerioMonitor™, and aligning screening efforts with maternal and child health services. NGOs and Ministries of Health can play a critical role by investing in workforce development, diagnostic infrastructure, and culturally tailored health education. Prioritizing such integration not only improves early detection and care coordination but also builds the foundation for resilient, equity-driven primary care systems in underserved settings.
