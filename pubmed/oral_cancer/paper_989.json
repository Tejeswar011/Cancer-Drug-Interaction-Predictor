This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This manuscript provides an in-depth review of both artificial and natural sweeteners, including polyols and plant-derived alternatives, examining their sweetening potency, glycemic index, modes of action, and applications in the food sector. The rising demand for sugar substitutes, fueled by health concerns such as obesity and diabetes, has prompted significant research into low-calorie and non-nutritive sweeteners. This work categorizes sweeteners into synthetic options (such as aspartame, sucralose, saccharin) and naturally occurring ones (such as stevia, monk fruit, and polyols like sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol), focusing on physico-chemical characteristics, relative sweetness (ranging from 100 to 220,0000 times sweeter than sucrose), and glycemic index, important for their use in diabetes-friendly food products. The current manuscript examines how these sweeteners interact with taste receptors to induce sweetness perception without contributing significant calories. It also discusses their health implications and controversies and limitations regarding healthy and safety data, process feasibility, market application trends, environmental stability, and commercialization challenges. The review also addresses challenges in scaling production and ensuring the economic viability of plant-based sweeteners, offering a forward-looking perspective on their commercialization in the food industry. sugar artificial sweetener natural sweetener nutrition diabetic Faculty of Animal Productions Engineering and Management, University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest, Romania Faculty of Animal Productions Engineering and Management, University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest, Romania. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The sugar-reduction trend has become increasingly popular among consumers, and food companies have a duty to explore new ways to balance the scales of consumers interested in indulgence with better-for-you varieties [ 1 Table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 foods-14-03182-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Mono- and disaccharides.

Replacing or reducing sugar in recipes can be accomplished with a variety of alternatives [ 18 19 20 Chronic overconsumption of added sugars, especially from sugar-sweetened beverages, has been strongly linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, kidney disease, gout, and tooth decay, with emerging evidence also suggesting possible connections to certain cancers and cognitive decline [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 Sweet taste has a powerful effect on the sensation of pleasure. Sweet taste receptors are the taste buds located on the surface of the tongue, which allow molecules and ions taken up from food to reach the receptor cells inside [ 36 37 38 39 40 Beyond their role in providing sweetness, sugars and sweeteners also influence metabolic responses, which can be evaluated through the concept of the glycemic index (GI). The GI represents a carbohydrate food’s relative ability to increase glucose in the blood. The human body needs glucose for energy, activity, and brain function. It is supplied to the body by the food ingested during the course of a day [ 41 42 The GI parameter divides foods on a 0–100 scale according to their effect on blood glucose levels [ 43 44 45 2. Artificial Sweeteners and Other Sugar Substitutes Sweeteners are substances that provide sweetness, are approved for consumption, and have variable taste profiles (clean or with an aftertaste) and are approved for use in the human diet [ 46 47 48 49 50 51 There are two very different categories of sweeteners: natural sweeteners: these are polyols (maltitol, xylitol) and plant-based (stevia, monk fruit); synthetic sweeteners have a much higher sweetening power than sucrose [ 52 53 54 55 Table 2 The metabolism of sweeteners differs from that of sugar in that they elicit little or no insulin secretion. Therefore, in both types of diabetes, levels of needed insulin must be adjusted if the sweetener is caloric (such as sugar alcohols) [ 10 56 57 foods-14-03182-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Artificial sweeteners potency. Sweetener 1 Potency * Reference  Advantame 20,000 [ 10  Acesulfame-K 200 [ 58  Alitame 2000 [ 59  Aspartame 180 [ 60  Cyclamate 30–40 [ 61  Neotame 8000 [ 62  Neohesperidin dihidrochalcon (NHDC) 1500–1800 [ 63  Saccharin 300 [ 64  Sucralose 600 [ 65 * Approximate potencies of high-potency sweeteners (sucrose = 1.0); 1 Sugar reduction is an ongoing consumer trend affecting the bakery industry [ 48 49 50 49 52 2.1. Saccharin Saccharin is a white, crystalline, colorless powder. The sweet taste of saccharin develops slowly, but after reaching its maximum intensity, it is quite persistent [ 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 2.2. Aspartame Aspartame was discovered in 1965, and in 1981 it was approved in over 100 countries for current consumption (in cereals, chewing gum, gelatine, pudding, and soft drinks) [ 70 75 76 77 78 64 79 80 81 2.3. Acesulfame K Acesulfame K has 200 times the sweetening power of sugar [ 82 83 84 84 85 2.4. Neohesperidin Dihidrochalcone (NHDC) Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone (NHDC) is a synthetic sweetener with high sweetening power (1500 and 1800 times stronger than sucrose) [ 86 87 Citrus aurantium 88 88 88 89 2.5. Sucralose Sucralose is a new synthetic sweetener obtained by chemical processes from ordinary sugar. By replacing three “hydroxy” groups in the sucrose structure, a substance with a sweetening power 600 times greater than that of conventional sugar has been obtained [ 50 90 71 91 71 82 92 93 2.6. Cyclamate Cyclamate has a sweetening power 30–50 times that of sucrose [ 94 12 95 96 97 2.7. Alitame Alitame is a low-calorie sweetener composed of two protein building blocks, L-aspartic acid and D-alanine. Depending on the application, alitamate is about 2000 to 3000 times sweeter than sugar, tastes very similar to sugar, and is cooked and baked [ 22 98 99 100 2.8. Neotame Neotame, a non-caloric artificial sweetener and analogue of aspartame. Chemically neotame is n-[n-[n-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-l-aspartyl]-l-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester [ 101 102 47 101 2.9. Advantame Advantame is the newest sweetener to appear on the market since 2008 and has a sweetening power of approximately 20,000–37,000 times that of sucrose [ 102 103 104 105 Advantame is a secondary amine of aspartame and 3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl) propanal (HMPA) [ 51 106 102 Ingested in the gastrointestinal tract, advantame is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid and methanol [ 53 107 108 109 2.10. Lugduname Lugduname is an artificial sweetener, with a sweetening power estimated to be between 220,000 and 300,000 times sweeter than sugar, but studies are still ongoing [ 110 111 32 112 6 3. Polyols Polyols, or polyhydric alcohols, are substances obtained by the hydrogenation of carbohydrates (mono-, di-, and oligoglycides) derived from starch, sucrose, and whey: sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, isomaltose, xylitol, lactitol, and erythritol [ 112 113 Table 3 114 115 116 foods-14-03182-t003_Table 3 Table 3 Syrups and other sugar-containing caloric sweeteners.

Xylitol Xylitol is a sweetening polyol first extracted from birch bark. Xylitol is a natural product, and the human body produces it (about 5–15 mg/day) as part of normal metabolism, as do many animals and plants [ 131 132 133 134 134 135 136 137 138 139 3.2. Mannitol Mannitol is a polyol isomer of sorbitol [ 140 141 142 Mannitol is in granular form, has high solubility in aqueous solutions, has high heat stability, and can be used in flavor coatings of various products. Among its applications, mannitol is used as an anti-caking agent due to its minimal ability to absorb moisture from the atmosphere and is suitable for use in products not requiring fermentation. It helps extend the shelf life and texture of food products in the absence of sugar. Industrial production of mannitol is achieved by chemical, enzymatic, and biotechnological methods. For extraction of mannitol from plant sources, supercritical and subcritical fluid technology has been widely used [ 143 144 144 104 3.3. Sorbitol Sorbitol is a substitute derived from glucose (it is a polyol), naturally present in various fruits and vegetables (red algae, pears, apples, cherries, and peaches), but also produced in normal metabolism. Industrially, it is obtained by chemical synthesis or fermentation. As a sweetener, it has a sweetening power of only 55% of the sweetening power of sugar, a pleasant sweet taste but with a slight aftertaste, a caloric value of 2.6 kcal/g, and a low GI of 4 [ 145 146 77 3.4. Maltitol Maltitol is a non-reducing hygroscopic sugar and disaccharide polyol that is listed as an alternative sweetener to sugar because, except for rumination, it has similar properties to sugar, possesses about 75–90% of the sweetening power of sugar, and has 2.1 calories/gram [ 51 107 147 148 3.5. Lactitol Lactitol is a polyol, not found as such in nature, and is produced exclusively by catalytic hydrogenation of lactose [ 149 150 151 152 152 4. Plant Origin Sweetener’s Natural sweeteners that are not necessarily carbohydrates have a zero GI and a low or zero calorie content. Research into these natural sweeteners has intensified in recent years as the industry demands a better alternative to synthetic/artificial sweeteners.

Sweet taste is detected by taste receptors clustered in the taste buds [ 6 167 168 The sweet taste receptor belongs to class C GPCRs, comprising metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), γ-amino butyric acid type B receptors, calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR), and many others [ 169 170 4.1. Steviol Glycosides The plant species Stevia rebaudiana Stevia rebaudiana 171 172 The leaves of S. rebaudiana 36 173 In the final product Reb A provides an intense sweetness with a slightly lingering aftertaste, especially at high concentrations [ 36 174 175 176 The starting material for stevia extracts may be natural, so we classify it as a sugar substitute, not an artificial sweetener, but these ingredients are still highly processed. Steviol glycosides are sweeteners obtained by extracting and purifying steviol glycosides from the dried leaves of Stevia rebaudiana 176 122 177 177 177 4.2. Curculin Curculin, or neoculin, is a complex of sweet proteins that was discovered and isolated in 1990 from the fruit of Curculigo latifolia 178 153 153 31 4.3. Glycyrrhizin (Liquorice) Glycyrrhizin is a natural triterpenoid sweetener with a zero GI and a sweetening power of 30–50 compared to sugar [ 179 Glycyrrhiza glabra 69 The sweet taste sets in more slowly than with sugar but is much more persistent. However, it exhibits a very intense, almost parasitic sweet taste and a persistent residual aftertaste. In food products, the addition of glycyrrhizin enhances the sweet taste of sucrose and improves the characteristics of other sweeteners such as lactitol or sorbitol. It maintains its licorice flavor characteristics and does not alter the physicochemical characteristics of food products [ 180 181 4.4. Thaumatin Thaumatin is a low-calorie sweetener and flavor enhancer. Thaumatin is the common name of a naturally occurring protein blend, consisting of thaumatin I and thaumatin II proteins together with minor amounts of plant constituents, obtained by extraction from the West African katemfe berry, Thaumatococcus daniellii 182 183 184 184 185 184 4.5. Luo Han Guo (Monk Fruit) Luo Han Guo ( Siraitia grosvenorii 186 187 188 189 190 191 4.6. Miraculin Miraculin is a glycoprotein naturally present in the fruit Synsepalum dulcificum 192 193 The sweet effect is influenced by various factors such as miraculin concentration, contact period of miraculin with the tongue surface, and acid concentration. The maximum sweetness-induced response was found to be equivalent to the sweetness of a 17% sucrose solution [ 193 54 Synsepalum dulcificum 194 Synsepalum dulcificum 194 4.7. Monellin Monellin is a protein containing 96 amino acids, with a sweet taste, which was discovered in 1969 in the fruit of the West African shrub known as Serendipity Berry ( Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii 195 196 153 197 101 198 199 153 Candida utilis 153 4.8. Hernandulcin Hernandulcin is an intensely sweet sesquiterpene with the molecular formula C 15 24 2 Lippia dulcis 200 201 201 4.9. Brazzein Brazzein is a sweet-tasting protein isolated from the fruit of the climbing plant Oubli Pentadiplandra brazzeana 98 202 74 197 197 197 Pentadiplandra brazzeana 202 203 153 195 4.10. Pentadin Pentadin is a sweet-tasting protein naturally found in the fruits of the Pentadiplandra brazzeana 204 197 4.11. Phyllodulcin Phyllodulcin is a natural sweetener; chemically, it is classified as a dihydroisocoumarin, specifically extracted from the leaves of Hydrangea macrophylla 205 206 5. Mechanisms of Sweet Taste Perception Sweet taste perception is a complex physiological event involving specialized receptors and neural pathways that interpret and respond to sweet stimuli ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Human mechanism of sweet taste perception, after [ 207 208 The detection of chemical stimuli, including sweet taste, occurs through specialized taste cells, grouped in taste buds, which are predominantly found on the dorsal surface of the tongue and on the soft palate [ 209 210 67 211 198 168 42 98 6. Comparison Between Natural and Artificial (Synthetic) Sweeteners There are two main categories of sweeteners: natural, plant-based sweeteners and artificial or synthetic sweeteners. Natural sweeteners are generally preferred [ 19 48 178 53 Figure 2 211 212 213 214 168 There are significant differences between rodents and humans in terms of preferences for certain sweeteners. In addition, at equivalent energy concentrations, humans perceive fructose as sweeter than sucrose, while rats and mice seem to find sucrose sweeter [ 215 Figure 2 Comparation between sweeteners, after [ 216 217 Saccharin is considered a poor substitute for sucrose in rodents [ 210 66 214 7. Controversies and Limitations of Sweeteners 7.1. Health Implications Sugars, such as mono- and disaccharides, are common components of our diet, providing energy and contributing to flavor and food preservation. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting the intake of free sugar to less than 10% of total energy intake, with a further reduction to below 5% for additional health benefits [ 217 218 The widespread use of artificial sweeteners [ 12 17 53 61 71 75 85 182 219 220 Figure 3 217 217 220 220 221 103 174 222 223 103 222 A notable discrepancy exists in study outcomes for aspartame’s safety, while other studies report adverse health effects. In July 2023, IARC classified aspartame as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B) based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity in both human and animal studies, reflecting its mandate to identify potential hazards without quantifying actual risk [ 31 In contrast, EFSA (2013) and WHO’s Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) (2023) have reaffirmed that aspartame is safe at the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels, after evaluating the totality of scientific evidence, including studies cited by IARC, and finding no substantiated carcinogenic effects [ 223 224 103 222 223 223 224 Despite decades on the market and rising consumption, there is a lack of conclusive evidence-based research to definitively discourage or encourage the regular, long-term use of non-nutritional sweeteners (NNS). One animal study using saccharin has shown increased food intake and greater weight gain compared to glucose-sweetened liquids, challenging the notion that NNS aid in weight loss due to calorie deficit [ 82 225 226 The traditional understanding was that NNS did not affect fasting glucose and insulin responses [ 221 220 55 74 94 142 227 228 One human study reported that saccharin significantly elevated glycemic response during exposure, compared to glucose controls [ 229 230 230 E. coli E. faecalis 231 103 174 222 7.2. Health and Safety Data There is ongoing debate regarding the health advantages and disadvantages of artificial and NNS, as regulatory bodies such as the FDA generally endorse their safety [ 212 222 223 224 232 225 224 226 111 80 81 111 98 233 218 224 225 81 75 Saccharin, recently re-evaluated by EFSA, has have an increased ADI of 9 mg/kg bw [ 234 74 74 Advantame [ 103 187 235 236 114 116 115 116 131 114 7.3. Sensory and Consumers’ Acceptance The innate human preference for sweetness is a fundamental determinant of food choice, yet increasing awareness of the negative health impacts of excessive sugar intake has driven consumer demand for NNS. In recent years, attention has shifted from synthetic sweeteners to so-called “natural equivalents”, including stevia, monk fruit, erythritol, and allulose, although regulatory definitions of “natural” remain ambiguous [ 189 190 191 Despite their potential, NNS frequently exhibit sensory drawbacks compared to sucrose, such as bitterness, metallic undertones, lingering sweetness, or mismatched temporal profiles, which may reduce consumer acceptance [ 74 83 95 206 237 238 On the other hand, NNS offer important advantages, including significant calorie reduction [ 114 115 61 70 191 57 36 175 177 239 240 241 Nonetheless, consumer acceptance remains complex and shaped by multiple trade-offs. While the “natural” positioning of certain NNSs appeals to health-conscious consumers, many individuals remain skeptical of artificial sweeteners, and overall awareness and engagement with front-of-package labelling is low. 7.4. Process Feasibility and Market Application Trends From a technological perspective, sweeteners differ significantly in stability: acesulfame-K, sucralose, and saccharin are highly heat and pH stable [ 69 72 84 85 74 16 114 176 188 The natural compounds not only provide sweetness but may also deliver additional functional benefits, such as antioxidant properties [ 6 117 156 239 240 115 In the context of precision nutrition, the use of artificial and natural non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) is increasingly viewed not as a universal solution but as part of individualized dietary strategies that account for genetic predispositions [ 242 243 244 245 246 Furthermore, metabolomics advancements along with nutrigenomics may guide the tailored dietary interventions, ensuring that the substitution of sugar with NNS maximizes health benefits—such as weight control, reduced glycemic load, and improved oral health—while minimizing potential risks, including metabolic disruption or gastrointestinal discomfort. In this way, precision nutrition could provide a potential framework for optimizing the role of sweeteners in modern diets. 7.5. Environmental Sustainability Various NNS, including saccharin, acesulfame-K, sucralose, and cyclamate, are poorly metabolized by the human body and are excreted unchanged [ 247 248 249 249 250 Apis mellifera Bombus 251 252 251 Utetheisa Kong white 253 254 251 252 249 26 Integrating ecological considerations with human dietary use of sweeteners emphasizes the importance of developing biodegradable, low-impact alternatives; optimizing sweetener formulations; and promoting targeted environmental stewardship to protect insect populations and maintain ecosystem stability. 7.6. Commercialisation Challenges The global artificial sweetener market is significant, valued at USD 2.9 billion in 2024 and projected to grow from USD 3.11 billion in 2025 to USD 5.44 billion by 2033, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.25% during this forecast period, while another source estimates the market value at USD 10.5 billion in 2025, forecasted to reach USD 15.2 billion by 2035 at a CAGR of 2.9% [ 253 218 222 223 224 The marketplace for artificial sweeteners is characterized by robust growth drivers, dominant product types, end-user segments, and key regional strongholds [ 254 255 By shifting the consumer preferences toward healthier options, as evidenced by 40% of American consumers reducing sugar intake in the past year [ 254 255 256 257 258 259 North America is the largest market, projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8% [ 253 253 253 260 8. Conclusions In conclusion, the sugar-reduction trend is essential for public health, necessitating the food industry’s exploration of viable alternatives. Sugar replacement is complex, given its multiple roles in products. A wide range of artificial sweeteners, polyols, and natural sweeteners is available, each with distinct sensory and metabolic properties. These offer benefits such as reduced calories and minimal glycemic impact but require careful selection due to potential digestive side effects or residual taste. Consumer acceptance and adoption vary, though all approved alternatives are rigorously studied and regulated. Ongoing research and monitoring of sweetener safety remain mandatory to optimize their availability for industrial applications. Notably, recent studies investigating the effects of engineered sweeteners on the human gut microbiota have produced conflicting results, with some reports suggesting potential alterations in microbial composition and glucose metabolism, while others indicate negligible effects. In addition, it is important to acknowledge the ongoing controversy regarding the potential link between artificial sweeteners and cancer. Much of this debate stems from animal studies conducted with doses far exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), which may not accurately reflect realistic human exposure. Nevertheless, these findings have raised public concern and continue to stimulate further research into the long-term safety of high-dose consumption. This highlights the need for further long-term research, particularly in specific populations such as patients with diabetes mellitus, to clarify the interplay between sweetener consumption, gut microbiota, and metabolic health.
