Summary Accurate identification of tumor-specific markers is vital for developing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based therapies. While cell surface antigens are seldom cancer-restricted, their post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly aberrant carbohydrate structures, offer attractive alternatives. Among these, the sialyl-Tn (STn) antigen stands out for its prevalent presence in various epithelial tumors. Although monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against STn have been developed, their clinical application has been hindered by concerns regarding specificity. Herein, we describe AM52.1, a mAb with unprecedented specificity for STn and lack of reactivity with healthy tissues. The single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of AM52.1 was assembled into a second-generation CAR scaffold. AM52.1CAR T cells efficiently targeted STn-expressing cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs), while sparing STn-negative cells. In further preclinical models, AM52.1CAR T cells robustly controlled gastric and tubo-ovarian tumors, as well as colorectal cancer mucinous peritoneal metastases, highlighting their strong therapeutic potential for targeting and managing complex solid tumors. Graphical abstract Highlights • AM52.1 monoclonal antibody binds exclusively to sialyl-Tn (STn) • AM52.1CAR T cells eradicate STn-positive tumor cells, even at low antigen density • AM52.1CAR T cells control tumor growth in vitro in vivo • AM52.1CAR T cells control peritoneal metastases in a complex PDX model Anti-glycan antibodies often show some degree of cross-reactivity. Abrantes et al. report AM52.1, an antibody with exceptional specificity for the tumor-associated sialyl-Tn (STn) antigen.

We further present CAR T cells based on AM52.1 mAb, AM52.1CAR T cells, which efficiently identify and kill STn-expressing cancer cells both in vitro Results AM52.1 is a pan-carcinoma antibody with specific recognition of sialyl-Tn STn-directed mAbs were generated by using ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM), a highly glycosylated protein containing 98% of STn as glycan content, as the immunogen ( Figure 1 Figure 1 O O Figure S1 Figures 1 S1 N Figure 1 AM52.1 antibody shows specific binding to sialyl-Tn (A) Schematic illustration of the predominant glycan structures in ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM) and its desialylated form, Asialo-OSM (A-OSM).

The staining patterns observed for the tested mAbs were consistent concerning the cell type and subcellular location within the same carcinoma tissue specimens ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Table S1 Figures 1 Figures 1 Taken together, these data demonstrate that AM52.1 exhibits higher specificity for the cancer-associated STn antigen compared to the currently available anti-STn antibodies, while AM51.1, despite being isolated from the same screening, displays cross-reactivity with other sialylated structures and appears to rely on a specific STn presentation context. In silico To further evaluate the therapeutic promise held by the AM mAbs, we engineered AM mAbs-based scFvs for subsequent CAR generation, and conducted a comparative analysis of their sequences and structures with those derived from the well-studied native CC49 clone (murine CC49, mCC49) and its humanized version (huCC49). 32 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 33 34 Figure S3 Table S2 Figure 2 Figure 2 in silico Figure 2 Sequence and structural analysis indicating a sialyl-Tn-restricted binding of the AM52.1-based single-chain variable fragment (A) Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) region derived from various anti-sialyl-Tn (STn) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens have emerged as appealing molecular targets for CAR T cell-based therapeutics due to their cell surface presentation and expression patterns highly restricted to malignant cells. Indeed, the truncated O 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 27 Previous STn-targeting CAR T cell approaches have employed various strategies to enhance both specificity and therapeutic efficacy. CARs targeting MUC1 glycoforms containing short O 38 29 , 30 NCT05225363 28 39 40 Our work introduces mAbs with unprecedented specificity, which were subsequently used as the basis for a CAR T cell therapy. We started by developing mAbs with restricted specificity by immunizing mice with a highly glycosylated mucin, OSM, known for its 98% STn content. Although eliciting a robust immune response toward glycans has proven to be a challenging task due to their characteristically low immunogenicity, 41 , 42 , 43 per se 44 N 26 The specificity of the AM mAbs toward STn and their binding reliance on the sialic acid component were further confirmed in a cellular context using glycoengineered STn-enriched gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and endogenously STn-expressing gastric and tubo-ovarian adenocarcinoma cells. While the binding capacity of AM52.1 mirrored that of the benchmark B72.3 and CC49 mAbs, neuraminidase digestion revealed its higher sensitivity to the absence of sialic acids, demonstrating AM52.1’s higher specificity for the sialylated glycan structure compared to the existing antibodies. Surprisingly, AM51.1 showed minimal detection of naturally STn-expressing cells, suggesting that its binding may rely on a specific presentation of the glycan moieties. Despite being isolated from the same screen, AM51.1 and AM52.1 show quite different binding preferences, underscoring the critical need to validate glycan-directed antibodies through comprehensive library screening. Given the major importance held by the accurate detection of STn in human samples for advancing cancer diagnostics and developing targeted therapies, the AM mAbs were tested against a diverse set of tumor tissues across multiple carcinoma types. Notably, AM52.1 exhibited selective staining of malignant tissues, similarly to the well-established B72.3 mAb. Considering that the success of antibody-based anti-cancer therapies relies on the ability of the selected mAbs to differentiate between cancerous and normal tissues, thus preventing on-target off-tumor toxicity, 45 , 46 N 47 Due to the limited availability of CAR T cells for solid tumors, their unique glycome profiles, and the finely tuned specificity of the AM antibodies, we engineered AM mAbs-based scFvs for subsequent CAR generation. Interestingly, the sequence of the AM52.1 mAb had few somatic mutations, differing from the germline sequences identified on IMGT by only four amino acids. Initially, we conducted an in silico 28 , 48 , 49 50 Given the glycan-specificity held by the AM mAbs, second-generation CAR molecules have been designed based on their scFvs. Importantly, this CAR design has recently proven effective in redirecting T cells toward osteosarcoma. 51 in vitro Using gastric PDOs as a preclinical model, we showcased the efficacy of AM52.1CAR T cells in eradicating GC PDOs expressing varying levels of STn, underscoring their potential therapeutic value in eliminating tumors, including those with low expression of the target antigen. Once more, AM52.1CAR T cells proved more effective than TAG72CAR T cells, which efficacy was limited to GC PDOs displaying high STn content. Importantly, AM52.1CAR Ts exhibited no reactivity against normal gastric mucosa-derived organoids, emphasizing once again their favorable safety profile. In OV-90, OVCAR-3, and SNU-16 xenograft mouse models, CAR T cells were administrated intraperitoneally to mimic locoregional delivery, 52 NCT05225363 in vivo 53 , 54 55 in vitro in vivo in vivo An additional demonstration of the clinical relevance of AM52CAR Ts cells was provided through a challenging PM-CRC PDX mouse model. This model closely recapitulates an aggressive and immune-restricted TME enriched with heavily sialylated mucins and characterized by a highly viscous peritoneal milieu, factors that are known to impede CAR T cell trafficking and function. Given the well-established role of STn in promoting immune evasion and contributing to an immunosuppressive TME, effective CAR T cell therapy in such conditions is particularly challenging. 53 , 54 In conclusion, we have successfully generated two mAbs, namely AM51.1 and AM52.1. While AM51.1 demonstrates dual recognition on O N in vitro in vivo Limitations of the study Our findings support the therapeutic potential of AM52.1CAR T cells, yet some limitations should be acknowledged. First, while the AM antibodies effectively detected STn across multiple carcinomas, we did not explore potential correlations with clinicopathological variables such as age, sex, tumor subtype, grade, or neoadjuvant therapy. Larger, clinically annotated cohorts are required to assess the predictive value of AM51.1 and AM52.1. In addition, although we compared AM51.1 and AM52.1 to established anti-STn antibodies such as B72.3 and CC49, given their relevance in diagnostics and in the CAR T cell field, broader benchmarking against other currently available antibodies could provide deeper insight into relative specificity. A key consideration is antigen heterogeneity and the potential for immune escape. Although AM52.1CAR T cells exhibited efficacy even against tumors with low STn density, we did not directly investigate mechanisms such as antigen loss or glycan remodeling, which could compromise treatment durability. Future studies employing longitudinal sampling will be essential to uncover these escape pathways and refine target selection, potentially informing strategies such as dual CAR targeting and/or adapting the treatment administration approach.

All other cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA), unless otherwise specified. The malignant oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line Ca1 was generously provided by Professor IC Mackenzie (Queen Mary University of London, London, UK). 57 58 All cell lines were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 All cell lines had their identity confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling using the PowerPlex 16 Human serum (HS) System kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by PCR amplification. The MKN45, COLO205, and LS174T cell lines were genetically modified by CRISPR/Cas9 methodology as previously described 60 Human samples Primary gastric ( n n n n n Human gastric organoids were previously established from fresh tissue samples collected at ULSSJ (ethical approved reference number CES 223/2021). 61 PDX material was obtained from a 68-year-old woman with PM-CRC patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic i.p. chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) at the OUH, Norway. 36 , 62 Buffy coats from healthy donors aged 18 to 60 years were purchased from the blood bank of the OUH, with approval from the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics South-East (2019/121). Human PBMCs were then isolated by density gradient and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until use. Animal models Female non-obese diabetic (NOD)- Prkdc scid -IL2rg Tm1 Method details Generation of monoclonal antibodies Immunization and hybridoma development Monoclonal antibody production was carried out essentially as described previously. 63 64 Characterization of mAbs Antibodies All antibodies used in the assays described below are listed in the key resources table Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed in 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated overnight (ON) at 4°C with 100 μL of OSM, in eight 2-fold serial dilutions in coating buffer (50 mM sodium carbonate/bicarbonate pH 9.5), starting with 0.1 μg/mL. A-OSM was used as negative control. After three washing steps with wash buffer (0.05% Tween/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), blocking was performed with 150 μL of blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS) for 1h at room temperature (RT), followed by incubation with 50 μL of mAbs diluted in blocking solution (B72.3 at 1 μg/mL, CC49, AM51.1, and AM52.1 at 5 μg/mL, and 1E3 at 1:2 dilution) for 2h at RT. Following washing steps, bound antibodies were detected with 50 μL of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (0.3 μg/mL; Dako, Berlin, Germany) for 1h at RT. After three additional washing steps, 50 μL of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Thermo Fisher Scientific) substrate were added to each well, plates were incubated in the dark, and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 0.5 M HCl. Optical Density was measured at 450 nm on a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy MX Microplate Reader, Winooski, VT, USA). Glycan microarray G O Flow cytometry Binding of AM antibodies to cell surface STn was determined through standard flow cytometric staining. Briefly, subconfluent cell cultures (10 5 Immunofluorescence Subconfluent cells growing on glass coverslips (Marienfeld Superior, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at RT. After blocking with UltraVision Protein Block (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 min at RT, incubation with the primary antibodies (B72.3, CC49, AM51.1, and AM52.1 at 5 μg/mL, and 1E3 at 1:2 dilution) was performed ON at 4°C. Cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody (2 and 4 μg/mL, respectively; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1h at RT, and nuclear staining with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiocam MR apparatus, using AxioVision v4.8 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). Western blotting Subconfluent cell cultures were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and protein lysates were directly collected by scrapping cells in Lysis Buffer 17 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) supplemented with 10% PhosSTOP (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 4% cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Total protein concentrations of whole cell lysates were determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). For glycan detection, membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBS-T) for 1h at RT, followed by ON incubation with the primary antibodies (B72.3, AM51.1, and AM52.1 at 5 μg/mL, and 1E3 at 1:2 dilution) at 4°C, and 1h incubation at RT with HRP-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse (0.16 μg/mL; Jackson Immunoresearch, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom) diluted in 5% and 1% BSA/PBS-T, respectively. Specific signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection method. Anti-β-Actin (0.04 μg/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used as loading control. Neuraminidase treatment Sialic acid removal was achieved by treatment with Clostridium perfringens 7 Immunohistochemistry The binding specificity of AM mAbs toward STn epitope was analyzed in primary gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, prostate, and tubo-ovarian carcinoma tissue sections, and in a series of normal healthy tissues. Briefly, deparaffinization and rehydration of tissue sections was performed, followed by neutralization of endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 2 2 Antibody coding sequence isolation and analysis The coding sequences from the antibodies produced by the selected hybridomas – AM51.1 and AM52.1 clones – were isolated as previously described. 63 Eurofins Genomics, Germany http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest Chimeric antigen receptor T cells Vector design The scFvs were built based on AM51.1 and AM52.1 starting with a secretion sequence (L chain) followed by the light chain variable fragment (V L 4 4 Eurofins Genomics 32 In silico analysis of the single-chain variable fragments The sequences of the scFvs built from the different antibodies were aligned using MAFFT 65 66 33 34 67 68 69 Transduction and expansion HEK-293-Phoenix cells (1.5 × 10 6 6 Shiga Japan 6 Reporter assay The J-76 cell line was transduced with a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter construct, 70 71 Cytotoxicity assay Virally transduced GFP- and luciferase-expressing (GFP + + 5 Degranulation assay STn-positive and -negative target cells were seeded (100 μL/well) in a 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 5 × 10 4 + + Cytokine release assay CAR T cells were co-cultured for 24h with the indicated cell lines at an E:T ratio of 1:1 in plain X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza Bioscience). Culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged to remove cells and debris, and diluted 1:2 prior to cytokine analysis. Cytokine levels were measured using the Bio-PlexPro Human Cytokine 17-plex Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Effector-only and effector-only cultures were included to establish baseline cytokine levels, and co-cultures of CD19CAR T cells with CD19-positive BL-41 cells served as a positive control. Cytokines were quantified using the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.), and concentrations were determined from a standard curve using Bio-Plex Manager software version 6.1. Patient-derived organoid studies Gastric PDOs were extracted from Matrigel (Corning) using Cell Recovery Solution (Corning, New York, United States) at 4°C for 45 min. PDOs were washed with culture media and dissociated into single cells using TrypLE (GIBCO) at 37°C. Cells were counted and seeded into either a 96-well flat bottom plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for the viability assay or a black 96-well ibiTreat flat, square bottom plate (ibidi) pre-coated with 15% Matrigel for immunostaining. CAR T cells were subsequently added to the wells at the indicated E:T ratios and incubated at 37°C for 24h. For immunofluorescent detection, PDOs were fixed with 4% PFA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at RT, followed by permeabilization with NH4Cl 50 mM/PBS for 30 min at RT, and with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 30 min at RT. Blocking was performed with 10% BSA/PBS for 30 min at RT, followed by ON incubation with the anti-CC3 antibody (dilution 1:200; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States) at 4°C. PDOs were subsequently labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (2 μg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at RT, and underwent nuclear staining with Phenovue Hoechst 33342 (Novabio, Kaunas, Lithuania). Images were acquired with an Opera Phenix Plus (PerkinElmer). To evaluate organoid viability, the co-culture media was aspirated, and 50 μL of fresh plain medium and 100 μL of CellTiter-Glo 3D Reagent (VWR International) were added. Subsequently, PDOs were mechanically disrupted, and the mixture was incubated for 25 min at RT. Luminescence signal was quantified through a SynergyMxTM MultiMode Microplate Reader (BioTekTM). Viability values were normalized to the Mock-treated conditions, with each PDO considered to have 100% viability under those conditions. Treatment of PDOs with 20 mM MG132 (Selleckchem, Houston, United States) was used as a positive control of the assay.
