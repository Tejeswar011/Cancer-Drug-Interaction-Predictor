Introduction The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing a significant transformation through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with traditional drug discovery methodologies. This evolution represents not a replacement of established approaches but rather the development of complementary tools that augment human expertise and computational chemistry methods that have been refined over decades [ 1 2 3 4 It is crucial to acknowledge that AI represents an additional tool in the drug discovery toolkit rather than a paradigm shift that renders traditional methods obsolete. The success of AI applications depends heavily on the quality of training data, the expertise of medicinal chemists interpreting results, and the robustness of experimental validation—all elements rooted in traditional drug discovery practices. While AI can process vast chemical spaces and identify patterns beyond human capability, it cannot replace the intuition, creativity, and contextual understanding that experienced drug discovery scientists bring to the process. The transformation extends to regulatory agencies, with the FDA now utilizing AI systems to support the review of drug applications while maintaining traditional review processes [ 5 6 7 The convergence of computational power, sophisticated algorithms, and vast biomedical datasets has created opportunities to address specific challenges in pharmaceutical development, where traditional approaches face mounting costs exceeding $2.6 billion per approved drug and development timelines stretching 10–15 years [ 8 9 10 The application of AI in molecular biosimilarity assessment demonstrates how these technologies can enhance rather than replace traditional analytical methods in pharmaceutical development [ 11 Small Molecules in the Context of AI-Assisted Discovery Small molecules represent the largest class of approved therapeutics, comprising approximately 90% of all marketed drugs [ 12 13 The complexity of modern drug discovery encompasses multiple interconnected challenges. Target validation requires a comprehensive understanding of disease biology and the mechanism of action [ 14 15 16 17 8 Artificial intelligence has emerged as a complementary technology that addresses specific challenges by leveraging computational power to process vast chemical spaces, predict molecular properties, and guide experimental design [ 18 19 20 21 Generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence that creates new content rather than simply analyzing existing data, has become particularly valuable as a tool in drug discovery by enabling the de novo design of novel molecular structures to complement traditional medicinal chemistry approaches [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 The integration of AI into drug discovery workflows has accelerated significantly in recent years, driven by advances in deep learning [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 2. Historical Evolution of Computational Small-Molecule Discovery The application of computational methods to small-molecule drug discovery has evolved through distinct phases, each building upon previous advances while establishing parallel tracks of development rather than linear progression. Early efforts in the 1960s focused on developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that correlated molecular descriptors with biological activity [ 36 37 The 1980s witnessed the emergence of structure-based drug design, enabled by advances in computational chemistry and molecular modeling [ 38 39 40 A significant development during this period was the emergence of pharmacophore-based drug design, which provided an indirect approach to drug discovery when target structures were unavailable. Pharmacophore modeling enabled researchers to define the essential features required for biological activity based on known active compounds, allowing for virtual screening without requiring detailed structural information about the target [ 41 The 1990s marked the transition toward knowledge-based systems and expert systems that encoded medicinal chemistry expertise into rule-based algorithms. These systems, exemplified by programs such as LHASA (Logic and Heuristics Applied to Synthetic Analysis), aimed to automate retrosynthetic planning and predict synthetic feasibility, thereby supporting drug discovery by helping chemists plan efficient synthetic routes to target molecules [ 42 43 The machine learning era (2000s–2015) introduced data-driven approaches that could learn patterns from experimental data without explicit programming. Support vector machines, random forests, and early neural networks began to complement traditional QSAR models, offering improved accuracy and the ability to handle non-linear relationships [ 44 45 46 The deep learning revolution (2015–2020) fundamentally expanded the computational toolkit available to drug discovery scientists. Deep neural networks demonstrated superior performance in molecular property prediction [ 47 30 48 49 50 51 21 The coexistence and integration of multiple computational approaches characterize the current era (2020-present). Foundation models, diffusion models, and agentic AI systems work alongside traditional molecular dynamics, docking, and QSAR methods. Rather than representing a linear evolution where newer methods replace older ones, the field has developed into a rich ecosystem where different approaches are selected based on the specific problem, available data, and project constraints [ 35 52 13 20 Figure 1 3. Core Applications of AI in Small-Molecule Discovery 3.1. Target Identification and Validation Target identification represents the earliest stage of drug discovery, where researchers seek to identify biological molecules whose modulation by small molecules can produce therapeutic benefits. Traditional approaches rely on literature review, genetic studies, and phenotypic screening, often requiring years of investigation [ 14 53 54 Natural language processing (NLP) technologies have proven particularly valuable for target identification by mining the vast biomedical literature. Modern NLP systems can process millions of scientific papers, patents, and clinical reports to identify novel target-disease associations, small-molecule drug repurposing opportunities, and biomarker candidates [ 55 56 Graph-based machine learning approaches have shown promise in target identification by modeling complex biological networks. These methods can integrate metabolic pathways and gene regulatory networks to predict novel therapeutic targets suitable for small-molecule intervention [ 57 58 3.2. Hit Discovery and Virtual Screening Hit discovery involves identifying small-molecule compounds that demonstrate measurable activity against a validated target, typically through high-throughput screening of compound libraries containing hundreds of thousands to millions of molecules. Virtual screening has emerged as a cost-effective complement to experimental screening, using computational methods to prioritize small molecules for synthesis and testing [ 59 Traditional virtual screening approaches for small molecules can be broadly categorized into ligand-based and structure-based methods. Ligand-based virtual screening relies on known active small-molecule compounds to identify structurally similar molecules using similarity metrics and pharmacophore models [ 37 60 AI has significantly enhanced both approaches through improved scoring functions, better conformational sampling, and integration of multiple data sources. Deep learning models trained on small-molecule-target binding data have shown competitive performance compared to traditional scoring functions in virtual screening campaigns. However, results vary significantly depending on the specific target and dataset [ 61 62 63 64 65 Ensemble methods combine predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and reliability, often outperforming individual algorithms by leveraging the strengths of different approaches while mitigating their weaknesses [ 66 Recent developments in diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in molecular generation and optimization, representing a significant advancement in the field [ 32 Figure 2 Table 1 3.3. Lead Optimization Lead optimization represents one of the most challenging aspects of small-molecule drug discovery, requiring simultaneous improvement of multiple molecular properties, including potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles. Traditional medicinal chemistry approaches rely on iterative design-make-test cycles guided by structure-activity relationships and expert knowledge [ 69 AI has enhanced lead optimization using multi-objective optimization algorithms, which can navigate complex property landscapes more efficiently than traditional approaches. Reinforcement learning methods have shown promise in treating small-molecule optimization as a sequential decision-making problem, where chemical modifications are selected to maximize a reward function that encodes the desired properties [ 70 71 31 Predictive modeling of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties has become increasingly sophisticated with the application of deep learning methods. Modern ADMET prediction models achieve accuracy levels that enable confident decision-making in small-molecule lead optimization campaigns [ 72 73 74 The relationship between Hit Discovery ( Section 3.2 Section 3.3 Section 3.4 75 3.4. De Novo Small-Molecule Design De novo molecular design represents an ambitious goal of AI-driven small-molecule drug discovery: the generation of novel chemical structures with desired properties that do not currently exist in existing chemical databases. This capability addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional screening approaches, which are constrained by the finite size of available small-molecule compound libraries [ 76 Generative models have emerged as the primary AI approach for de novo small-molecule design, with several architectures showing promise, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are probabilistic generative models that learn to encode molecular structures into a continuous latent space and decode them back into molecular representations, allowing for smooth interpolation between known compounds and the generation of novel small-molecule structures [ 77 78 Generative adversarial networks (GANs) consist of two competing neural networks: a generator that creates new molecular structures and a discriminator that attempts to distinguish between generated molecules and real training data [ 22 79 Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks treat molecular generation as a sequence modeling problem, learning to generate valid SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings that represent small-molecule chemical structures [ 30 80 50 81 Diffusion models represent a significant recent advancement in de novo molecular design, offering a fundamentally different approach to molecular generation [ 32 Superior generation quality: They produce more chemically valid and diverse molecules Training stability: Unlike GANs, they don’t suffer from mode collapse or training instabilities 3D structure generation: Particularly effective for generating 3D molecular conformations Property control: Can incorporate property constraints during the generation process Recent work has demonstrated that diffusion models can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating molecules with specific properties while maintaining drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility [ 82 Active learning strategies optimize the selection of compounds for experimental testing by iteratively updating models based on new experimental data, focusing resources on the most informative experiments [ 83 84 Recent advances in molecular generation have focused on incorporating synthetic accessibility and retrosynthetic feasibility into the design of small molecules. Models that jointly optimize molecular properties and synthetic routes ensure that generated small-molecule compounds can be efficiently synthesized in practice [ 85 86 Figure 3 3.5. Prediction of Small-Molecule Pharmacokinetics and Toxicity Accurate prediction of pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties remains one of the most critical applications of AI in small-molecule drug discovery, as poor ADMET properties account for a significant proportion of late-stage failures [ 87 Deep neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in small-molecule ADMET prediction by learning optimal molecular representations directly from chemical structure [ 47 88 67 Multi-task learning approaches have proven valuable for small-molecule ADMET prediction by leveraging shared information across related endpoints. Models trained simultaneously on multiple pharmacokinetic parameters can achieve better performance than single-task models, particularly for endpoints with limited training data [ 68 Explainable AI (XAI) methods have become increasingly crucial in small-molecule ADMET prediction, providing mechanistic insights and building confidence in model predictions [ 89 90 67 91 92 Table 2 4. AI-Discovered and AI-Assisted Small-Molecule Development: Success Stories and Lessons Learned The practical impact of AI in small-molecule drug discovery is increasingly demonstrated through real-world applications, ranging from approved drugs to compounds advancing through clinical trials. It is essential to distinguish between AI-discovered compounds (those designed de novo by AI systems), AI-assisted compounds (where AI tools have significantly contributed to the optimization of molecules), and AI-assisted repurposing (where AI identified new uses for existing drugs). These examples illustrate both the potential and limitations of AI technologies in pharmaceutical development. 4.1. AI-Assisted Drug Repurposing: Baricitinib Baricitinib represents a significant success in AI-assisted drug repurposing rather than de novo AI drug discovery. Initially developed by Incyte and licensed to Eli Lilly as a JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, baricitinib was later identified by BenevolentAI through the analysis of biomedical literature and drug-target interaction networks using AI as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic, based on its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties [ 100 101 4.2. AI-Discovered Clinical Candidates Halicin represents one of the most celebrated early successes of AI-driven drug discovery. Discovered by researchers at MIT using deep learning models trained on diverse molecular databases, halicin demonstrated potent antibiotic activity against drug-resistant bacteria, including Acinetobacter baumannii Mycobacterium tuberculosis 102 DSP-1181 (Exscientia) became one of the first AI-designed small-molecule drugs to enter human clinical trials in 2020, specifically for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder [ 103 ISM001-055 (Insilico Medicine) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis represents a significant milestone, as it is one of the first AI-discovered small molecules to reach Phase II clinical trials [ 104 4.3. Clinical Development Challenges and Lessons Learned The field has experienced notable challenges that provide essential insights into the current limitations of AI in drug discovery. While AI can accelerate the discovery and optimization phases, clinical success depends on many factors beyond initial compound design. The discontinuation of DSP-1181 after Phase I, despite demonstrating a favorable safety profile, illustrates that accelerated discovery timelines do not guarantee clinical progression [ 103 A comprehensive analysis of AI-discovered and AI-assisted compounds reveals that, while these molecules are entering clinical trials at an increasing rate, their progression rates through clinical development remain like those of traditionally discovered compounds [ 105 Table 3 Essential lessons from early AI drug discovery efforts include: The importance of high-quality training data that accurately represents the complexity of biological systems The need for experimental validation at each stage of the discovery process The value of hybrid approaches that combine AI predictions with human expertise The recognition that AI tools are most effective when integrated into existing workflows rather than replacing them entirely 5. Practical Case Studies The following case studies illustrate the successful implementation of AI technologies in real-world small-molecule drug discovery programs, demonstrating both the potential and practical considerations of these approaches. These examples are based on documented approaches and methodologies commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry [ 115 116 117 5.1. Scaffold Hopping Using Reinforcement Learning for Small-Molecule Kinase Inhibitor Discovery A major pharmaceutical company faced the challenge of identifying novel small-molecule kinase inhibitors that avoided existing patent landscapes while maintaining potency against their target of interest. Traditional approaches based on literature scaffolds were constrained by extensive intellectual property coverage, which limited opportunities for discovering novel small-molecule chemical matter. The research team implemented a reinforcement learning approach using the REINVENT algorithm [ 70 Over the course of six months of iterative optimization, the AI system generated approximately 10,000 novel small-molecule compounds, which were then subjected to further computational analysis. Synthetic accessibility filtering using the SCScore algorithm [ 118 This case study demonstrates the practical value of AI in addressing real-world constraints beyond simple property optimization, including intellectual property considerations and synthetic feasibility for small-molecule discovery. The integration of multiple scoring functions and constraints in the reward function proved critical for generating actionable results [ 115 5.2. Multi-Objective Optimization in Small-Molecule Lead Refinement Using Active Learning A biotechnology company developing treatments for neurodegenerative diseases faced the challenge of optimizing a promising small-molecule lead compound that suffered from poor brain penetration and metabolic instability. Traditional medicinal chemistry approaches had made limited progress after 18 months of optimization, with improvements in one property typically accompanied by deterioration in others. The team implemented an active learning strategy using Gaussian process models to predict multiple small-molecule ADMET properties simultaneously, including brain-to-plasma ratio, metabolic stability, and aqueous solubility. The acquisition function balanced exploration of novel chemical space with exploitation of promising regions, using expected improvement with multiple objectives. Uncertainty quantification enabled confident identification of compounds most likely to advance the program. Initial model training used 150 synthesized analogs from previous medicinal chemistry efforts. The active learning system recommended 25 small-molecule compounds for synthesis in the first iteration, selected to maximize information gain across all property dimensions. Experimental testing confirmed predictions within acceptable error ranges for 80% of compounds. Three successive rounds of active learning, each involving 20–25 new compounds, identified a lead compound with 10-fold improved brain penetration and 5-fold improved metabolic stability compared to the starting point. The key success factors included careful experimental design to ensure data quality, robust model validation procedures, and close collaboration between computational and medicinal chemistry teams. The active learning approach reduced the number of synthesis cycles required from an estimated 8–10 to 4 cycles, saving approximately 12 months of development time [ 116 5.3. AI-Enhanced High-Throughput Screening Triage for Antiviral Small-Molecule Discovery During the COVID-19 pandemic, an academic-industry collaboration screened a 100,000-compound library against SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, yielding approximately 2500 small-molecule compounds that showed greater than 50% inhibition at primary screening concentrations. Traditional triage approaches based on chemical similarity and simple property filters were insufficient to prioritize this enormous hit set for follow-up studies within the urgent timeline constraints. The team implemented a Bayesian neural network approach to predict the quality of small-molecule hits and the likelihood of successful optimization. The model was trained on historical antiviral screening data from related coronavirus targets, incorporating molecular descriptors, predicted ADMET properties, and target-specific features. Uncertainty quantification enabled the identification of high-confidence predictions and prioritization of experimental validation efforts. The AI model ranked the 2500 primary screening hits, with experimental validation focused on the top 200 small-molecule compounds predicted to have the highest potential for optimization. This subset demonstrated a 5-fold enrichment in confirmed antiviral activity compared to random sampling, with 35% of the tested compounds showing activity in dose-response studies. The approach identified 12 distinct chemical scaffolds suitable for lead optimization, compared to 3–4 scaffolds that would have been identified through traditional clustering approaches. Subsequent lead optimization efforts validated the AI predictions, with small-molecule compounds ranked highly by the model showing superior profiles in terms of potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties. Two compounds identified through this process advanced to preclinical development studies within 8 months of initial screening, compared to typical timelines of 18–24 months for traditional approaches [ 117 6. Emerging Trends and Transformative Technologies 6.1. Foundation Models and Self-Supervised Learning The emergence of foundation models and self-supervised learning represents one of the most significant developments in AI-driven small-molecule drug discovery. These approaches are closely interconnected, as foundation models are typically developed through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale molecular datasets, followed by fine-tuning for specific applications [ 52 Foundation models are large-scale models pre-trained on millions of small-molecule compounds and their associated data, which can be fine-tuned for specific applications with minimal additional training data. ChemBERTa, MoleculeNet, and similar foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse molecular property prediction tasks, often achieving state-of-the-art results with limited domain-specific training. These models enable transfer learning across different therapeutic areas and molecular targets, potentially reducing the data requirements that have historically limited AI applications in specialized domains. Self-supervised learning approaches enable models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled chemical data, which is particularly valuable given the relative scarcity of high-quality labeled data in drug discovery compared to other AI domains [ 119 The relationship between foundation models and self-supervised learning is synergistic: self-supervised pre-training enables the development of foundation models that can capture fundamental chemical principles and structure-property relationships, which then generalize across diverse small-molecule applications. Early examples include MegaMolBART, which achieved strong performance on small-molecule optimization tasks after pre-training on 1.1 billion SMILES strings [ 120 6.2. Computational Sustainability and Energy Considerations The environmental and economic costs of training large-scale AI models have become increasingly important considerations in drug discovery applications. Training state-of-the-art foundation models can consume substantial computational resources, with carbon footprints comparable to those of major industrial processes [ 121 Several approaches are being developed to address these concerns. Model compression and knowledge distillation techniques can reduce the computational requirements of deployed models by 10- to 100-fold while maintaining much of their predictive performance [ 122 123 Cloud-based platforms are increasingly offering carbon-neutral computing options, and distributed training approaches can leverage renewable energy sources more effectively. The pharmaceutical industry is beginning to incorporate sustainability metrics into AI project evaluation, balancing model performance against environmental impact and computational costs. 6.3. Quantum Machine Learning and Molecular Simulation Quantum machine learning represents an emerging frontier with potential applications in small-molecule simulation and drug discovery, though practical implementations remain limited by current hardware constraints. Quantum algorithms for molecular property prediction and optimization may offer computational advantages for certain classes of problems, particularly those involving quantum mechanical effects that are difficult to simulate classically [ 124 Current quantum computers are limited by their small qubit counts, short coherence times, and high error rates, which restrict their practical applications to small molecular systems. However, hybrid classical-quantum algorithms are being developed that could provide near-term advantages. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms have shown promise in calculating molecular ground state energies for small systems, potentially enabling more accurate predictions of small-molecule-target interactions [ 125 Quantum machine learning algorithms for molecular property prediction are being explored, with potential advantages in feature spaces that grow exponentially with system size. Quantum kernel methods and quantum neural networks may offer computational speedups for specific molecular learning tasks, though demonstrated advantages over classical methods remain limited to specific problem classes [ 126 The timeline for practical quantum advantages in drug discovery remains uncertain, with conservative estimates suggesting that it will take 10–20 years before quantum computers can outperform classical methods for realistic molecular systems. However, continued advances in quantum hardware and algorithm development may accelerate this timeline. 6.4. Agentic AI and Autonomous Discovery Systems Agentic AI systems represent a paradigm shift toward autonomous drug discovery platforms that can independently navigate multiple aspects of the discovery pipeline with varying degrees of human oversight [ 35 Recent developments in agentic AI for drug discovery include systems that can: Autonomously read and synthesize scientific literature to identify drug targets Generate hypotheses about novel therapeutic mechanisms Design experimental protocols to test hypotheses Interpret experimental results and refine understanding Propose next steps in the discovery process The integration of agentic AI with automated synthesis and testing platforms is creating increasingly autonomous discovery loops. Examples include: Systems that combine target prediction, molecular design, and synthetic planning Platforms that can autonomously navigate patent landscapes AI agents that coordinate multiple specialized models for different tasks Decision-making systems that balance risk, cost, and potential reward Early implementations have demonstrated the ability to identify and optimize small-molecule lead compounds with reduced human intervention. However, complete autonomy remains a long-term goal rather than a current reality. Key challenges include: Ensuring robust decision-making under uncertainty Maintaining ethical oversight to prevent misuse Validating autonomous decisions against human expertise Managing the complexity of integrated multi-step processes Current agentic AI systems in drug discovery typically operate with human oversight at critical decision points, representing a hybrid approach that leverages both machine efficiency and human judgment. 6.5. Automated Synthesis and Closed-Loop Discovery The integration of AI with automated synthesis platforms is creating closed-loop discovery systems that can rapidly iterate between small-molecule design and testing. Companies like Strateos, Emerald Cloud Lab, and academic initiatives are developing robotic synthesis platforms that can execute AI-designed synthetic routes with minimal human intervention [ 86 Closed-loop systems integrate small-molecule generation, synthetic route planning, automated synthesis, and biological testing into unified workflows. Early implementations have demonstrated the potential to identify and optimize small-molecule lead compounds in significantly reduced timeframes. However, the extent of timeline reduction varies considerably based on the specific application and system maturity. 6.6. Data Standardization and Collaborative Initiatives The success of AI in drug discovery depends critically on the availability of high-quality, standardized datasets. Several significant initiatives are addressing data standardization and sharing challenges: The FAIR Data Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) are being adopted by pharmaceutical companies and research institutions to enhance data quality and sharing [ 127 Pre-competitive Consortia such as MELLODDY (Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for Drug Discovery) enable pharmaceutical companies to collaborate on AI model development while keeping proprietary data secure through federated learning approaches [ 128 Open Targets Platform provides integrated access to disease-target associations and has become a critical resource for AI-driven target identification [ 129 Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC) represents a community-driven effort to create standardized benchmarks and datasets for AI in drug discovery, addressing the critical need for consistent evaluation protocols [ 130 7. Challenges and Limitations Despite significant progress, several fundamental challenges continue to limit the widespread adoption and effectiveness of AI in small-molecule drug discovery. Data quality represents perhaps the most critical limitation, as AI models are only as good as the data used to train them [ 131 37 Model interpretability remains a significant concern, particularly for regulatory applications where understanding the basis of AI predictions is crucial for safety assessment [ 89 Generalizability across chemical space represents another fundamental challenge, as AI models often perform poorly on compounds that differ significantly from their training data [ 132 Regulatory acceptance of AI-designed drugs continues to evolve, as current regulatory frameworks were developed for traditional drug discovery approaches [ 133 Ethical considerations, including bias in AI models that could exacerbate health disparities (e.g., underperformance in datasets for underrepresented ethnic groups), must be addressed [ 54 Table 4 8. Regulatory Evolution and Validation Frameworks The regulatory landscape for AI in drug discovery is rapidly evolving, with agencies worldwide developing new frameworks to address the unique challenges posed by AI-assisted drug development. The FDA’s Model-Informed Drug Development (MIDD) framework provides a pathway for incorporating computational models into regulatory submissions. Recent initiatives, such as the FDA’s AI Pilot Program, are exploring specific applications of AI in the field of drug development [ 136 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has established the Innovation Task Force (ITF) to provide guidance on novel methodologies, including the application of AI in drug discovery. The ITF offers scientific guidance for developers of AI-based drug discovery platforms, helping establish acceptable evidence standards for regulatory submissions [ 144 Digital twins and virtual clinical trials represent emerging regulatory concepts that have the potential to revolutionize the clinical development process. These approaches use AI models to simulate patient populations and predict clinical outcomes, potentially enabling more efficient study designs and patient stratification strategies [ 145 Model validation requirements are becoming increasingly standardized, with emphasis on: Transparency: Clear documentation of model architecture, training data, and validation procedures Reproducibility: Ability to recreate model predictions using documented procedures Robustness: Performance across diverse test sets and edge cases Continuous monitoring: Post-deployment surveillance for model drift and performance degradation International harmonization efforts, including work by the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), are developing global standards for AI applications in drug development, though consensus on many issues remains in development. 9. Outlook and Transformative Potential The future of AI in small-molecule drug discovery is likely to be characterized by increasingly integrated and autonomous systems that combine human expertise with machine intelligence. Fully automated drug discovery platforms represent an aspirational vision, where AI systems can navigate substantial portions of the discovery pipeline from target identification to preclinical candidate selection [ 146 9.1. Human-AI Collaboration Paradigms Human-AI collaboration will likely define the near-term future of small-molecule drug discovery, with AI systems augmenting rather than replacing human expertise. Successful implementations leverage the complementary strengths of human creativity and intuition with AI’s ability to process large datasets and explore vast chemical spaces [ 147 The most promising collaboration models involve AI systems that can propose hypotheses, design experiments, and interpret results while working closely with human researchers who provide domain expertise, quality control, and strategic direction. These hybrid approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to either human-only or AI-only approaches in several small-molecule discovery applications. 9.2. Standardization and Benchmarking Initiatives Standardization and benchmarking represent critical needs for the field, as the lack of consistent evaluation protocols has hindered progress and adoption [ 88 130 Open-source software platforms and shared computational resources are democratizing access to AI technologies, thereby accelerating innovation. Projects like DeepChem, RDKit, and OpenEye are creating accessible tools that enable researchers without extensive computational expertise to apply AI methods to their small-molecule research problems [ 68 9.3. Timeline Transformation and Future Projections Recent advances in AI technologies suggest the potential for significant reductions in small-molecule drug discovery timelines, though the extent of these improvements varies considerably across applications and therapeutic areas. The combination of foundation models, automated synthesis, agentic AI systems, and integrated AI platforms may enable more efficient discovery programs. Conservative estimates suggest that AI integration could reduce overall timelines for small-molecule drug discovery by 30–50% in specific applications. At the same time, more optimistic projections envision greater reductions for therapeutic areas or compound classes. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the potential for accelerated discovery, with AI-assisted programs identifying small-molecule clinical candidates in compressed timeframes compared to traditional approaches. Key factors that may contribute to timeline acceleration include: Foundation models that reduce training data requirements and enable rapid deployment to new targets Generative models, including diffusion models, that can explore vast chemical spaces efficiently Automated synthesis platforms that reduce synthesis bottlenecks Multi-task learning approaches that optimize multiple properties simultaneously Active learning strategies that minimize experimental requirements Increasingly sophisticated agentic AI systems However, it is essential to note that clinical development timelines, regulatory review processes, and manufacturing scale-up represent significant bottlenecks that may limit the overall impact of AI on drug development timelines. The most important potential for timeline reduction may be in the preclinical discovery phases, where AI can have the most direct impact. 10. Practical Implementation Guidelines Organizations seeking to implement AI technologies in their small-molecule drug discovery workflows should follow a systematic approach that begins with clearly defined objectives and success criteria. Successful AI implementation requires careful attention to data infrastructure, model validation, team building, and organizational change management. 10.1. Strategic Planning and Readiness Assessment Organizations should start by conducting a comprehensive assessment of their current capabilities, data assets, and strategic objectives. This includes evaluating existing datasets for quality and completeness, assessing computational infrastructure requirements, and identifying specific use cases where AI can provide the most significant value. Return on investment calculations should consider both direct cost savings and indirect benefits such as reduced attrition rates and accelerated timelines. 10.2. Data Infrastructure and Quality Management Establishing robust data management systems is a prerequisite to successful AI implementation. Organizations should: Audit existing datasets for quality, completeness, and consistency Implement data standardization procedures (FAIR principles) Invest in data curation and annotation capabilities Establish bias auditing procedures to ensure ethical compliance Develop secure cloud-based platforms for collaboration while maintaining IP protection 10.3. Technology Selection and Integration Specific use cases and data availability should drive the choice of AI methods: Start with simpler, well-understood approaches before adopting complex methods Evaluate vendor solutions for technical capabilities, integration requirements, and support Consider both commercial and open-source options Ensure compatibility with existing workflows and systems Plan for scalability and future expansion 11. Conclusions Artificial intelligence has emerged as a valuable complementary technology in small-molecule drug discovery, offering significant opportunities to enhance specific aspects of the discovery process when integrated adequately with traditional methodologies. From early rule-based systems to modern foundation models, diffusion models, and agentic AI systems, the evolution of AI technologies has progressively expanded the toolkit available to drug discovery scientists. Current applications span the entire discovery pipeline, from target identification through lead optimization, with demonstrated successes including baricitinib (AI-assisted repurposing), DSP-1181, halicin, ISM001-055/rentosertib, and numerous other small-molecule compounds advancing through clinical development. The distinction between AI-discovered compounds (de novo design), AI-assisted optimization, and AI-enabled repurposing is crucial for understanding the current state of the field. While AI has shown success in accelerating specific tasks such as virtual screening, property prediction, and molecular generation, it remains most effective when used in conjunction with human expertise and traditional drug discovery methods. The case studies presented illustrate that significant value can be realized when AI technologies are thoughtfully implemented with clear objectives, appropriate validation, and recognition of their limitations. The practical implementation of AI in small-molecule drug discovery requires careful attention to data quality, model validation, and integration with existing workflows. Successful organizations are those that view AI as an augmentation of human expertise rather than a replacement, fostering collaborative environments where computational and experimental teams work together to leverage the complementary strengths of human creativity and machine intelligence. The challenges of data quality, model interpretability, and generalizability remain significant and require continued research and development. Recent advances in foundation models, diffusion models, agentic AI systems, automated synthesis platforms, and integrated AI workflows suggest substantial potential for enhancing efficiency in small-molecule drug discovery. Conservative estimates suggest a 30–50% reduction in timeline for specific preclinical applications, although clinical development timelines remain essentially unchanged. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the potential for accelerated discovery when appropriate resources and incentives are aligned, with AI playing a supporting role in identifying repurposing opportunities. Looking forward, the field continues to evolve rapidly with emerging trends including quantum machine learning, multi-modal AI approaches, and closed-loop discovery systems. The integration of automated synthesis platforms and increasingly sophisticated agentic AI systems may further expand the capabilities and accessibility of AI-enhanced small-molecule discovery. However, fundamental challenges remain in data quality, model interpretability, generalizability, regulatory acceptance, computational sustainability, and ethics that will require continued collaborative efforts across the scientific community. The successful realization of AI’s potential in small-molecule drug discovery will require coordinated efforts across multiple stakeholders. Industry, academia, and regulatory agencies must collaborate to develop appropriate standards, validation procedures, and regulatory frameworks that ensure the safety and efficacy of AI-assisted drug development. Educational initiatives that train the next generation of researchers in interdisciplinary approaches combining computational and experimental expertise will be crucial for sustaining progress. Most importantly, the field must maintain focus on the goal of delivering better medicines to patients more efficiently. As AI technologies continue to mature and demonstrate value in real-world applications, their adoption in small-molecule drug discovery will likely accelerate. Organizations that begin developing AI capabilities now, while carefully attending to the implementation challenges and best practices outlined in this review, will be better positioned to realize the benefits of these technologies. The future of small-molecule drug discovery will increasingly be characterized by the seamless integration of human expertise and artificial intelligence, working together as complementary tools to address the most challenging problems in medicine and ultimately improve human health through more efficient, effective, and innovative therapeutic development.
