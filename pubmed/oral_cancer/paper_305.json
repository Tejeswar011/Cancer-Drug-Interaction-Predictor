In healthcare, Human Digital Twins (HDTs) serve as virtual counterparts to patients. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), a digital twin must be personalized, dynamically updated, and have predictive capabilities to—in the context of health care—inform clinical decision-making. This scoping review aims to assess the current state of HDTs in healthcare, examining whether the literature aligns with the NASEM definition and identifying trends. A systematic literature search was conducted, covering articles published from January 2017 to July 2024. Only 18 of the 149 included studies (12.08%) fully met the NASEM digital twin criteria. Digital shadows made up 9.4% of studies, general digital models comprised 10.07%, and virtual patient cohorts were another 10.07%. Only two studies mentioned verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ), a critical NASEM standard for model reliability.

Digital twins were first described by Dr. Michael Grieves in a 2002 engineering presentation at the University of Michigan regarding Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) 1 1 2 Since then, digital twins have been widely adopted in various fields of engineering to enable instantaneous forecasting of system behaviors, allowing engineers to anticipate and respond to potential issues before they arise. These virtual models facilitate performance enhancement by identifying optimal operating parameters and processes as well as dynamically tracking the health of their physical counterparts, providing updates as needed. For example, a digital twin of a missile may model the missile in real-time using sensors on the physical object to predict aerial trajectory and provide automatic adjustments to the missile’s flight path. The application of digital twins has expanded in recent years with the development and synergy of technologies including Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cognitive Computing (CC), Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced sensor systems, allowing for more feasible real-time updates from physical to virtual and vice versa 3 Recently, digital twin applications have entered the realm of healthcare. Katsoulakis et al. noted a substantial increase in publications referencing digital twins on PubMed since 2017 3 4 4 In healthcare, Human Digital Twins (HDTs) have realized value in the modeling of human organs, organ systems, and cellular interactions 5 6 7 8 9 5 To clarify the definition and standardize usage across disciplines, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) came together to set a standard definition for digital twins in their 2024 report entitled, “Foundational Research Gaps and Future Directions for Digital Twins.” 10  “A digital twin is a set of virtual information constructs that mimics the structure, context, and behavior of a natural, engineered, or social system (or system-of-systems), is dynamically updated with data from its physical twin, has a predictive capability, and informs decisions that realize value. The bidirectional interaction between the virtual and the physical is central to the digital twin” 10 This definition emphasizes the personalization of the digital twin to a specific patient system, allowing for dynamic updates between physical and virtual and the capability to inform decisions that realize value. Additionally, the NASEM emphasizes the importance of verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) in the development of digital twins. VVUQ has previously been described by the National Research Council (NRC) in the context of computational models to evaluate trustworthiness and quality of model predictions 11 Given their rising popularity, this study conducted a scoping review of the literature on digital twins in healthcare, particularly HDTs, to clarify how the term is being used, what systems are being modeled, and for what purposes. We utilized the definition of “digital twin” provided by the NASEM to evaluate whether proposed digital twin models are in accordance with NASEM guidelines. We extended these requirements to HDTs by evaluating whether such twins are personalized to the patient, dynamically updated between physical and virtual systems, and are utilized in clinical decision support. Additionally, we distinguished between human-in-the-loop recommendations and automatic updates to the physical system. This manuscript serves as a review of the current literature regarding HDTs in healthcare and as a summary of current trends in HDT use and model designs. We aimed to investigate whether the term “digital twin” is being used incorrectly or imprecisely within the literature and to assess the consistency and accuracy of its application in various contexts. Results Study selection Overall, we identified 1817 records from database searching. We removed 481 duplicates. Following title and abstract screening, we sought retrieval for 363 articles based on their mention of digital twins in healthcare. We were unable to retrieve four articles. Of the remaining 359 articles, 210 were excluded for the following reasons: 85 lacked full-text availability; 65 did not claim to create or evaluate a HDT; 28 were non-peer-reviewed pre-prints; 14 were review articles, commentaries, or editorials; 13 evaluated non-human digital twins; and five were not published in English. This yielded 149 articles for final inclusion. A full-flow diagram assessing study identification, screening, and inclusion can be seen in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 PRISMA flow diagram for article identification, screening, and inclusion. 481 references were excluded because they were duplicates, and 1187 were removed during screening, leaving 149 studies to be evaluated for the purposes of this review.

We compiled data to compare the utilization of clinical-grade versus consumer-grade sensors. Among the studies analyzed, 91 (61.06%) employed clinical-grade sensors, 35 (23.49%) utilized consumer-grade sensors, and 30 (20.13%) did not incorporate sensors at all. Notably, seven studies (4.70%) used both sensor types and were therefore included in the counts for both categories. Studies that did not employ sensors instead relied on alternative data sources, such as electronic health records (EHR), medical notes, or registry databases. In addition to sensors, we examined the role of imaging data in constructing digital models with approximately half of the studies ( n n n n n n n n n n n 2 Of the models that met the NASEM standard for digital twins, there were eight metabolic studies 18 19 21 25 29 14 22 24 17 23 12 15 16 20 13 20 64 Discussion This scoping review evaluated the use of the term “digital twin” in healthcare, with a particular emphasis on HDTs. A secondary objective was to characterize the types of models labeled as “digital twins” across various organ systems and clinical applications, and to assess the extent to which these models adhered to the definition established by the NASEM. A total of 149 studies published between 2017 and 2024 met the inclusion criteria for this review. The results of the current study highlight a significant increase in research interest in digital twins in healthcare. This is supported by findings by Katsoulakis et al., who reported that publications regarding digital twins in healthcare have increased each year from 2017 to 2023, with a rising proportion of studies exploring such healthcare applications relative to the broader digital twin literature 3 To provide context for the types of human models being developed, we established 13 retrospective system categories. Categories were determined based on the organ system or disease process primarily modeled. Studies evaluating cardiac models were the most common ( n n n n n The predominance of cardiac models underscores the research interest in precision cardiac care, mirroring its status as the number one cause of mortality worldwide 158 Similarly, metabolic digital twin models were likely widely developed due to the global prevalence of metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity, which create a strong demand for personalized healthcare solutions. Like cardiac systems, these models have abundant data available, from biomarkers, lab tests, and wearable devices. These models hold significant potential for tailoring treatments by predicting individual responses to interventions such as medications, diet, and exercise. The third most prevalent system modeled was the musculoskeletal system, for which most models were exclusively skeletal. This emphasis likely stems from the skeletal system’s foundational role in movement and load distribution, making it a logical starting point for biomechanical modeling. Moreover, bone structures are relatively straightforward to image and quantify using advanced modalities such as CT and MRI, facilitating accurate virtual reconstruction. Once imaged, bones can be modeled as mechanical structures with comparative ease, supporting the development of detailed and reliable simulations. Interestingly, among the HDT models reviewed, no musculoskeletal models met the NASEM criteria for digital twins, and only a single cardiac model qualified. In contrast, eight of the 18 qualifying models (44.4%) were metabolic. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that only three unique metabolic models were identified across eight different studies. Metabolic models made up a disproportionately large share of NASEM-compliant digital twins—representing a threefold increase in relative representation compared to their ranking among all models included in the review. This overrepresentation of metabolic models among NASEM-compliant HDTs likely reflects both practical and conceptual factors. In many physiological systems, it is either difficult or unnecessary for the digital twin to directly influence its physical counterpart. The only fully autonomous HDT identified in this review was a cardiac model that modified the physical twin through automated defibrillator output. Outside of such specialized use cases, real-time updates to cardiac or musculoskeletal systems are more challenging to implement. For instance, while influencing heart rate may seem feasible in theory, implementing real-time adjustments to cardiovascular function typically requires indirect interventions and is less straightforward than metabolic modifications. A similar situation is realized when it comes to the musculoskeletal system, where an “update” to the physical twin conjures imagery of a robotic exoskeleton repositioning the patients’ limbs. On the other hand, updates to the metabolic system are easily realized in the form of recommendations regarding diet and exercise. Moreover, wearable devices such as continuous glucose monitors are comfortable, widely available, and capable of generating high-frequency data. By comparison, cardiac monitoring often relies on bulkier, less accessible tools (e.g. multi-lead ECGs or blood pressure cuffs), which may limit their integration into real-world, continuously updated HDT systems. Other organ systems, such as neurological or reproductive systems, are less represented likely due to lesser demand (relative to cardiac, metabolic, and musculoskeletal systems) and the reduced availability of high-quality data for model training and validation. Additionally, monitoring of these systems tends to be less straightforward than cardiac or metabolic systems. The technology required to perform such data collection, particularly in a continuous manner, may not be commonly available relative to devices such as wearable fitness trackers, portable blood pressure cuffs, or glucose monitors. However, several emerging technologies may help address these limitations and expand the applicability of HDTs across a broader range of medical domains. In neurology, the growing adoption of wearable EEG headsets, brain-computer interface devices, and smart neurostimulation implants may soon enable continuous monitoring of brain activity in real-world environments. This could facilitate the development of digital twins for epilepsy management, neurodegenerative disease tracking, and cognitive function modeling. In reproductive health, advances in transdermal hormone sensors, smart fertility trackers, and implantable pelvic monitors could allow for dynamic modeling of ovulatory cycles, hormone fluctuations, and pelvic floor disorders. Beyond sensor hardware, advances in AI, particularly in multimodal data fusion and time-series forecasting, may allow researchers to synthesize heterogeneous data sources such as patient-reported outcomes, clinical notes, imaging studies, and wearable sensor data into cohesive, patient-specific digital models. This would decrease the amount of sensor data needed, placing more of an emphasis on dynamically updated patient history. Together, these innovations suggest that the delay in modeling of less common HDT systems may be temporary. As emerging technologies mature and become more widely accessible, it is likely that future HDT research will achieve broader system coverage, higher model fidelity, and greater clinical integration. Despite the promise of HDTs to provide precision healthcare, the current study reveals several challenges to their development and classification. As per the inclusion criteria, all evaluated papers referred to the model at the center of their study as a digital twin. However, only a subset of these models met the definitional criteria outlined by the NASEM (Table 3 12 12 12 Table 3 Studies by model type Model classification Reference Human digital twins 12 29 Traditional, automatic human digital twins 12 Human-in-the-loop human digital twins 13 29 Digital shadows 30 43 Personalized digital models 6 7 44 128 with one-time clinical decision support 7 44 73 without clinical decision support 6 74 128 General digital models 129 143 Virtual patient cohorts 8 144 157 The other category that would meet the NASEM standard of a true digital twin would be human-in-the-loop type twins, of which there were 17 studies 13 29 14 22 24 A second example of a human-in-the-loop style HDT was Twin Health’s twin precision nutrition/treatment program 18 26 27 29 While models like the Twin Precision system exemplify digital twins that offer real-time, personalized feedback to influence patient behavior, not all virtual representations of humans function in this way. Some instead are passive models, lacking interactivity or bidirectional influence—characteristics more aligned with digital shadows. The present study identified 14 such examples 30 43 37 In contrast to digital shadows, which serve solely as passive reflections, personalized digital models are designed to simulate individualized physiology without requiring real-time updates. The present study identified 87 models fitting this category 6 7 44 128 For example, a patient with a complex medical condition may face several possible treatment options. In such scenarios, a personalized computer model can be used to simulate each intervention and predict the likely outcome. Assuming the simulations are accurate, the physician and patient can select an appropriate therapy based on the predicted results. In these cases, once a successful intervention has been selected, further simulation is no longer required. The current study has identified 31 such models 7 44 73 55 Beyond decision-support applications, many personalized digital models were developed for research, proof-of-concept, or physiological modeling purposes without directly informing clinical care. The present study identified 56 personalized models that did not inform treatment decisions 6 74 128 76 Cardiac models were represented in all types of models examined but were particularly prevalent as personalized digital models that were not used for decision support ( n While many personalized models are built around individual-level data, others lack this degree of specificity and are instead designed to represent average or theoretical human physiology. This study identified 15 examples of “digital twins” that are better described as general digital models 129 143 139 Some studies focused on creating simulated populations rather than representations of individual patients. These virtual patient cohorts serve as another distinct modeling approach commonly but inaccurately labeled as digital twins. The current study identified 15 examples of virtual patient cohorts 8 144 157 151 Beyond model classification, an important theme that permeates the NASEM report on digital twins is the assertion that the digital representations should be fit for purpose In addition to the complexity and fidelity of the models, the sensors used to inform their digital counterparts similarly varied. Across the full set of included studies, 23.5% of studies used consumer grade sensors. However, when the focus was narrowed to only the digital twins meeting the NASEM criteria, the portion that used consumer grade sensors increased to 55.6%. Conversely, in the total population of included studies, the portion that employed clinical grade sensors was 61.07%, while the portion in the NASEM digital twin group decreased to 27.8%. This trend remained consistent even after adjusting for likely unique models. In that context, the proportion of consumer-grade sensors rose from 21.9% to 50.0% when shifting from the broader population to NASEM-compliant models, while clinical-grade sensor use decreased from 62.8% to 41.7%. This may reflect the need for portable sensors for the regular updates required by HDTs, whereas clinical sensors may be too large, expensive, cumbersome, and/or impractical for subjects to carry and maintain. This could be indicative of an outsized role that consumer grade devices may play in the evolving HDT research space. In addition to model design and data input considerations, the rigor with which digital twin models are evaluated is critically important. In their report on digital twins, NASEM stressed the importance of verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) for all aspects of digital twin research. In summary, verification involves checking that a computer program correctly implements and solves the equations of a mathematical model, including code verification and solution verification. That is, verification exists to ensure the computer programming correctly performs intended algorithms while assessing the accuracy of its solutions. Validation is about evaluating how accurately a model represents the real world with respect to its intended usage. Uncertainty quantification focuses on measuring incertitude in model calculations, with an aim to account for all sources of uncertainty and quantify the impact of each on the overall results. The nature of HDTs does not render researchers exempt from VVUQ considerations: the NASEM report specifically lists a cancer patient twin as an example scenario for which VVUQ protocols should be applied. In the present work, only two papers of all included studies contained the term VVUQ (in the body of the text). While both of these works conducted their studies in the spirit of VVUQ, they both pointed to reasons why a rigorous treatment of VVUQ standards cannot be satisfactorily applied at present. One 64 57 88 94 126 128 The importance of VVUQ in digital twin development cannot be overstated, particularly in healthcare, where model accuracy directly impacts clinical decision-making. For researchers wishing to employ a rigorous treatment of VVUQ, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Validation and Verification (V&V) Standards Committee in Computational Modeling and Simulation has released a suite of standards that can be adopted or serve as examples for HDT endeavors 159 161 11 Teams working on patient specific models for medical applications are already leveraging VVUQ methodology, and they can provide valuable insights into how VVUQ can be systematically assimilated into HDT research. For instance, Galappaththige et al. outline a comprehensive roadmap for incorporating VVUQ practices into the development of personalized digital models 162 163 164 The implementation of VVUQ in HDT studies will necessarily vary based on the model’s purpose, design, and clinical context. Mechanistic HDTs, which rely on physics- and math-based representations of human systems, require rigorous verification and validation to ensure that their theoretical frameworks are both accurate and adaptable to individual patients. These models must be customized to capture patient-specific parameters and reliably predict how different interventions will influence physiological outcomes. In contrast, empirically trained HDTs, often powered by machine learning, must focus on the adequacy and representativeness of their training data. These models require robust validation on external datasets and careful uncertainty quantification to ensure that their predictions generalize accurately to the human systems they aim to model. The degree of VVUQ stringency required also depends on whether the HDT outputs are interpreted by a human or implemented automatically. Human-in-the-loop systems can tolerate a higher degree of uncertainty because human judgment provides an additional safety layer. Conversely, HDTs that autonomously update the physical twin, such as implantable devices that adjust physiological parameters in real time, must meet far more stringent VVUQ standards to ensure patient safety. In these settings, model outputs are acted upon without human oversight, necessitating high confidence in model reliability and robustness. For instance, metabolic HDTs that provide lifestyle recommendations may tolerate some level of predictive uncertainty, as their outputs pose relatively low immediate risk. In contrast, cardiac HDTs that influence real-time hemodynamic parameters demand significantly lower uncertainty thresholds to prevent harm. Thus, the level of trust required, and the methods used to establish that trust must be tailored to the clinical application and technical design of the HDT. Despite offering a comprehensive overview of the HDT landscape, this review is subject to several limitations that warrant consideration. While the categories discussed in this review are well-defined, the boundaries between categories can be unclear. This imprecision leads to a degree of subjectivity in categorizing and classifying the models and concepts reviewed. The subjective nature of these categorizations may influence the consistency and comparability of the results. Additionally, the categorization of models was retrospective and determined by the discretion of the authors to best summarize the body of publications regarding HDTs. To the authors’ knowledge, there are no well-established categorization systems for HDTs. As such, some studies may have fit into multiple categories with regard to model type but were placed into the one single category which was considered to be the best fit. Additionally, this review is limited by the quality of the included studies. Concerns about study quality often center around methodological rigor and the validity of treatment outcomes. Since the present review is focused on the usage and interpretation of specific terminology, as opposed to the evaluation of medical interventions, the impact of study quality is somewhat diminished. Although variations in reporting standards and analytical approaches exist, these issues are less likely to skew the findings in the context of our analysis. Our primary concern is an assessment of how the term “digital twin” is defined and used across different studies, which, while important, does not carry the same weight as methodological issues would in a clinical review. Therefore, while the quality of studies remains a consideration, its relative impact on our conclusions is minimal compared to that in traditional systematic reviews. Furthermore, this team is unequipped to evaluate the general language competency of each group in a way that would be relevant to the present research, and any assessment we could perform would be highly subjective and of questionable value. Indeed, many of the typical measures of quality (e.g., bias, validity, sample size, study design, data collection methods) are all irrelevant to the context surrounding how each group used the term “digital twin”, so the measures of quality that should be employed in the present case are uncertain. In light of these considerations, the choice was made to not include a formal quality assessment. Despite a lack of formal quality assessment, we observed that most studies successfully achieved their stated objectives—often focusing on evaluating model performance, even if the models themselves did not qualify as HDTs. However, methodological rigor varied considerably across the literature. Some studies demonstrated strong practices, such as incorporating real-world patient data, integrating multimodal sources, and clearly articulating their modeling rationale. Mechanistic studies often excelled at generating generalized models grounded in first principles. However, these models were typically the farthest from meeting the criteria for digital twins, as they lacked personalization or dynamic interaction with a physical counterpart. Empirical studies, on the other hand, were often methodologically sound in their approach to model development and evaluation—frequently dividing their data into training and testing sets and, in some cases, providing access to source code or datasets to support reproducibility. Despite these strengths, many studies lacked external validation, detailed reporting on reproducibility measures, or comprehensive approaches to uncertainty analysis. Empirical models were typically validated using held-out portions of the training data, while mechanistic studies were often limited to proof-of-concept demonstrations. More robust mechanistic models tested their predictions against real-world data, though such efforts were less common. This variation highlights the evolving nature of HDT research and reinforces the need for more standardized reporting, validation frameworks, and methodological transparency. While variability in methodological rigor was evident, the findings of this review offer important insight into current usage patterns and definitional inconsistencies in the HDT literature. In our scoping review of publications including the term “digital twin” since 2017, we found that 18 out of 149 studies (12.1%) appropriately used the term in describing their models, while the remainder (87.9%) applied the term to models that did not align with the NASEM definition of a digital twin. Pervasive misuse of the term “human digital twin” confuses and complicates future efforts to advance healthcare. Establishing a solid foundation for the term “human digital twin” requires setting clear standards for its usage. In order to effectively implement this concept, the health research community must embrace the framework set forth by the NASEM digital twin report. Going forward, the computational models appearing in HDT studies should incorporate three essential elements: (1) a digital model parameterized to be representative of a specific individual. (2) dynamic, ongoing updates to the digital twin model with data collected by sensors (etc.) reporting measurements quantifying the state of the specific individual (or part thereof) that the digital twin model represents. (3) ongoing modification to the state or behavior of said specific individual, based on insights and predictions generated by the digital twin model. Models which do not meet the definition of a HDT, such as digital shadows, general digital models, and virtual patient cohorts, should be categorized correctly and consistently in literature as well (Figs. 2 3 Fig. 2 Properties of the various model types. Digital model is an all-encompassing term under which most, if not all, computerized models can be categorized. When a digital model is tailored to reflect the unique circumstances pertaining to a specific individual, they become personalized Fig. 3 Taxonomic flow chart for digital models. This flow chart can be used to determine the categorization of digital models, differentiating between virtual patient cohorts, general digital models, personalized digital models, digital shadows and human digital twins. This comprehensive approach will ensure that usage of the term “human digital twin” is both consistent and accurate, setting a precedent for its future development and application in healthcare. This work provides a framework to systematically and rigorously categorize studies involving digital models and HDTs in healthcare, ensuring a more precise alignment with their conceptual definitions and promoting consistency in their scholarly classification (Figs. 3 4 Fig. 4 Model classification and data flow for digital models—differentiating digital models from digital shadows and human digital twins, in healthcare. Data flows into a virtual model from a variety of sources, stemming from human subjects or their environment. Some models are parameterized exactly once, while others are dynamically updated in a recurring fashion. In digital twin models, the data flows from the model back into the data-sources (i.e. the subject or physical system is somehow modified based on predictions made by the digital twin) such that the ongoing model parameterization reflects decisions and advice generated by the model. To address the need for standardization and clearer definitions in the HDT field, we propose a forward-looking roadmap organized into short- and long-term goals. In the short term, researchers should focus on adopting standardized terminology by promoting consistent use of the terms “digital twin” and “human digital twin” in alignment with NASEM criteria, and by clearly distinguishing related concepts such as general digital models, personalized digital models, digital shadows, and virtual patient cohorts. While comprehensive VVUQ may not be feasible in early-stage studies, researchers should aim to transparently report validation steps, modeling assumptions, and sources of uncertainty. Early interdisciplinary collaboration among academic, clinical, and industry stakeholders will also be critical to ensure that models are clinically relevant and grounded in real-world utility throughout their development. Finally, to improve reporting standards and methodological rigor, journals and funding bodies should encourage authors to provide clear descriptions of model architecture, data inputs, training and testing protocols, and performance evaluation metrics. Encouraging transparency in training data provenance and parameterization practices will further support reproducibility and facilitate meaningful comparison between models. Over the longer term, more rigorous infrastructure and guidance will be needed to support scalable, trustworthy HDT deployment. This includes the development and adoption of HDT-specific VVUQ frameworks, potentially by adapting existing standards such as ASME V&V 40 to account for patient variability, real-time model updates, and clinical risk. Regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency should be engaged to define approval pathways and evaluation criteria specific to HDTs. To support reproducibility and collaboration, shared infrastructure is also needed, including open-access data repositories, benchmark modeling tasks, and shared validation datasets. Finally, clinical implementation studies should be prioritized to evaluate how HDTs integrate into real-world workflows and influence decision-making, safety, and patient outcomes. By gradually integrating these actionable steps, a solid foundation is laid for the widespread implementation and efficacy of HDTs in healthcare. Methods A review protocol for this study was not registered. Search strategy and selection criteria We devised a systematic search to identify research regarding HDTs in healthcare, conducted on the PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore databases. These databases were selected to obtain a comprehensive search of digital twins in both medical and biomedical engineering applications and the following queries were executed on July 3rd, 2024: Pubmed: <2017 – 2024 week 27> (\"digital twin*\"[Title/Abstract] AND (\"medic*\"[Title/Abstract] OR \"medicine\"[MeSH Terms] OR medicine OR \"health*\"[Title/Abstract] OR \"health\"[MeSH Terms] OR health OR \"patient*\"[Title/Abstract] OR \"patients\"[MeSH Terms] OR patient OR \"hospital*\"[Title/Abstract] OR \"hospitals\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"clinic*\"[Title/Abstract]) AND (2017:2024[pdat])) Embase: <2017 – 2024 week 27> ('digital twin':ti,ab,kw OR 'digital twin':de) AND ('medic*':ti,ab,kw OR 'medicine'/exp OR medicine OR 'health*':ti,ab,kw OR 'health'/exp OR health OR 'patient*':ti,ab,kw OR 'patient'/exp OR patient OR 'hospital*':ti,ab,kw OR 'hospital'/exp OR hospital OR 'clinic*':ti,ab,kw OR 'clinic'/exp OR clinic) AND [2017-2024]/py IEEE Explore: <2017 – 2024 week 27> (\"Document Title\":\"digital twin*\" OR \"Document Abstract\":\"digital twin*\" OR \"Author Keywords\":\"digital twin\") AND ((\"Document Title\":\"medic*\" OR \"Document Abstract\":\"medic*\" OR \"Author Keywords\":\"medic*\" OR \"Mesh_Terms\":\"Medicine\") OR (\"Document Title\":\"health*\" OR \"Document Abstract\":\"health*\" OR \"Author Keywords\":\"health*\" OR \"Mesh_Terms\":\"Health\") OR (\"Document Title\":\"digital twin*\" OR \"Document Abstract\":\"digital twin*\" OR \"Author Keywords\":\"digital twin\") AND (\"Document Title\":\"patient*\" OR \"Document Abstract\":\"patient*\" OR \"Author Keywords\":\"patient*\" OR \"Mesh_Terms\":\"patient\") OR (\"Document Title\":\"hospital*\" OR \"Document Abstract\":\"hospital*\" OR \"Author Keywords\":\"hospital*\" OR \"Mesh_Terms\":\"hospitals\") OR (\"Document Title\":\"clinic*\" OR \"Document Abstract\":\"clinic*\" OR \"Author Keywords\":\"clinic*\")) We limited searches to peer-reviewed studies published after January 1st, 2017, following a review by Katsoulakis et al. which showed the publication of articles referring to digital twins in healthcare has become more prevalent since 2017 3 human Exclusion of review articles was rooted in our desire to focus on primary data and applications. Additionally, we aimed to avoid redundancy that could arise if review authors adopted the terminology used by their reviewees. For example, a reviewer might refer to a NASEM HDT as a ‘digital twin’ in one project and to a digital shadow as a ‘digital twin’ in another project, simply because those were the terms used by the respective reviewees. To avoid the potential ambiguities and redundant classifications, the decision was made to exclude review articles. Similarly, framework papers posited about how certain digital twins might be achieved, but without a tangible model for evaluation our ability to reliably judge and categorize a team’s specific implementation falters. Frameworks frequently focused on a few key, novel aspects of their proposed models, providing detailed descriptions of these components. However, they often neglected to address the practical implementation or use of their ‘digital twins,’ which is essential for evaluating compliance with the NASEM definition. In an effort to avoid ambiguity with frameworks whose categorization was contingent upon details that were not precisely articulated, we opted to exclude frameworks altogether for the sake of consistency. Study selection and data extraction We extracted and deduplicated database search results. Two independent reviewers (RS and BT) performed title and abstract screening on Covidence 165 Author affiliation We defined author affiliation as the institution associated with the corresponding author and was grouped as academic/medical, industry, or government. Model design We categorized the design of the model as empirical, mechanistic, or hybrid. Empirical models of digital twins included models that utilized data to train machine learning (ML) models for predictive purposes and models that otherwise identified trends in measured data through techniques such as regression or traditional statistical analyses. Mechanistic models included those that relied on first principles for their development—models computing their predictions based upon the underlying chemistry or physics, as opposed to statistics or curve fitting—allowing patient-specific personalization through the adjustment of pre-determined parameters to customize the model. Hybrid models utilized elements of both model types to customize the “twin” to the specific patient. Model classification We determined the classification of the model based on the NASEM definition of digital twins and the use of patient-specific personalization, dynamic updating of input and output parameters, and whether the model was intended to be utilized for decision support. We made a further distinction between a model’s production of human-in-the-loop recommendations versus automatic updates to the human system. Thus, after conducting a preliminary review of literature, we stratified the models into the following categories: virtual patient cohort, digital model, personalized digital model, personalized digital model used once for decision support, digital shadow, human-in-the-loop digital twin, and traditional digital twin. Although distinct entities, human-in-the-loop and traditional HDTs are both considered to satisfy the NASEM criteria for digital twins. A detailed description of different model types can be found in Figs. 2 4 A general digital model involves the digital representation of a class of real-world objects, without automatic data updates from physical to virtual and without being specific to a particular object—or in the present case, without being specific to a particular person 4 4 166 Categorization of digital models We retrospectively identified 13 categories of digital models depending on the system they aimed to describe. These included cardiac, musculoskeletal, respiratory, neurological, hepatic, metabolic, epidermal, reproductive, immune, cancer, whole body, surgical site, and other twins. Metabolic twins were further broken down into diabetic twins if they attempted to model the metabolism in patients with diabetes. Musculoskeletal twins were further classified as skeletal twins if they focused solely on skeletal structures. Sensor classification We recorded a tabulation regarding clinical grade versus consumer grade measurements for model creation and updates. Data taken from devices that are typically only available in a clinical setting were categorized as clinical grade. Examples include measurements from 12-lead ECG data, MRI data, or CT scans. Measurement data from devices that are available from retail outlets or are publicly available were classified as consumer grade. In this category, examples include smart phones, wearable fitness trackers (e.g., Fitbit Sense 2), consumer video signals (e.g., Microsoft Kinect, web cams), scales (smart or otherwise), and subjective, self-reported scores (e.g., pain scores). Additionally, we recorded and categorized imaging data collected by clinical and consumer grade devices by modality—including video data, still photographs, MRI data, CT data, radiographic imaging, and other imaging systems. Verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) We screened studies for mention of the VVUQ process. We further analyzed studies that included information regarding VVUQ for adherence to VVUQ standards via self-reporting. Data analysis We narratively synthesized and presented descriptively data as frequencies and percentages. We conducted cross-tabulations to further stratify and describe the model classification.
