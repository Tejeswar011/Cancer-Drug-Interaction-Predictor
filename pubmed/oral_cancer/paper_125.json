RTX is an agonist of the TRPV1 receptor cation ion channel which is activated by capsaicin, heat, and inflammatory conditions. RTX injection at peripheral sites of pain generation will produce a chemo-inactivation of local nerve terminals and axons and block the transmission of nociceptive signals to spinal cord. Clinical human studies with RTX to treat osteoarthritis (OA) pain were preceded by extensive animal and cell system testing which revealed mechanisms of action, range of potentially treatable pain problems, and the safety and efficacy of this interventional analgesic agent. The present review concentrates on RTX, but also examines intraarticular (IA) capsaicin, a lower potency TRPV1 agonist, for the same indication. We review studies of RTX in human patients and canine veterinary subjects with OA pain. To date, results of several phase I clinical trials have only been reported in abstract form and these studies, despite their preliminary nature, will be examined herein. The present assessments indicate that RTX has strong therapeutic promise to be an innovative approach to medical management of pain relief in osteoarthritis and may be permissive to beneficial tissue remodeling. Plain Language Summary The way that knee pain is treated today needs to be improved. Knee pain from osteoarthritis is common and causes disability for many Americans. This kind of knee pain is caused by arthritis and inflammation. We are testing a new way to treat knee pain using a natural chemical called resiniferatoxin (RTX). RTX comes from a plant and is like the spicy part of chili peppers. RTX affects nerves that feel heat and pain. In knees with arthritis, these pain sensing nerves are active. Doctors inject RTX into the knee in a doctor’s office. It makes the nerves stop sending pain signals. The result is less pain. One shot of RTX lasts a long time, as much as half a year. RTX does not like opioids, steroids, or other drugs used today. It avoids the side effects of those drugs by acting in a new way. RTX may be an important new option for patients with knee pain.

Introduction and scope of review Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful degenerative disease of the synovial joints. Patients with knee OA often present with pain and disability impeding their range of motion of the knee joint, and ultimately ability to walk and move independently. Global OA prevalence rises with age and is more prevalent in older women than men [ 1 1 2 3–5 6 7 2. Peripheral routes for pain control The debate about pharmacological treatments for OA pain using mechanisms in the peripheral nervous system versus those in central nervous system is brought into sharp focus by the intraarticular use of RTX in osteoarthritis. Pain problems that involve a “peripheral generator,” which we define as a peripheral site from which nociceptive signals are being produced and transmitted to the central nervous system, are all candidates for treatment with RTX injected at, into, or near the generator site. This frame-of-reference does not discount the existence of central sensitization, but several studies suggest that central sensitization is dynamically maintained by nociceptive input from sites of tissue damage [ 8–10 11–15 3. The problem of OA pain Osteoarthritis is a progressive, chronic degenerative joint disease that involves degradation of articular cartilage, inflammation of the synovium, and structural changes such as bony overgrowth that can restrict movement. OA affects approximately 33 million people in the USA [ 16 17–19 Because OA pain has a clear peripheral site of origin, it fulfills the definition of a peripheral generator. A wide variety of approaches are used in attempts to manage OA pain. These include lifestyle changes (e.g., weight loss and low impact exercise), topical creams, gels, and patches, freeze therapy, systemic drugs including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and injectable corticosteroids, viscosupplementation, and joint replacement surgery [ 20–22 23 24 25 26 27 28 20 29 30 4. RTX mechanism for pain control Recent advances in molecular pain mechanisms have led to the exploration of a potent agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel [ 31 Figure 1 36 37 Euphorbia resinifera Euphorbia 38 39–41 42 43 31 33 44–46 47 48 Figure 2 49 32 40 50 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 1. Structure of RTX and capsaicin and intraarticular injection. (a) The vanilloid ring for both molecules are at the bottom of each model. For capsaicin, a hydrocarbon tail is attached by an amide bond to the vanilloid ring, the nitrogen is in blue. For RTX, more complex polycyclic structure is attached to the vanilloid ring. Note the three oxygens of the ortho ester at the top that positions the benzene ring. RTX does not contain a nitrogen atom. RTX is a super-agonist that binds pseudo-irreversibly to TRPV1, it is approximately 500 times more potent than capsaicin [ 32 33–35 Figure 2.

Transcripts were hybridized with RNAscope probes for TRPV1 P2RX3 OPRM1 SPP1 TRPV1, OPRM1 P2RX3 48 TRPV1 OPRM1 TRPV1 Figure 3. Model of TRPV1, RTX binding, and selective activation of TRPV1 neurons in primary cultures of human DRG. (a) molecular model of the TRPV1 homotetramer embedded in a lipid bilayer. One monomer is colored gold, the other three are green. In the top-down view, the pore is in the center of the tetramer. RTX binds to each of the monomers. This opens the channel and causes a large and sustained transmembrane calcium influx. The result is a highly selective chemoaxotomy or inactivation of nerve terminals that contain TRPV1. Other neurons that do not make TRPV1, as shown in panels (b–d), are unaffected. (b,c) selective response of human cultured DRG neurons to RTX assessed by increase in [Ca2+] by fluo-4AM imaging (arrows: responding neurons). (d) increase in normalized fluorescence intensity (numbered DF/F traces refer to cells in a and b) is large and abrupt. The elevation of intracellular calcium from one exposure of the culture to RTX is sustained for more than 4 hours and is suggestive of imminent cell death. The action of RTX is selective; large increases are seen in neurons 1–4. Adjacent non-responding cells, 5,6,7,8, maintain normal calcium levels. Transposition of this action to TRPV1-positive axons in the cauda equina after intrathecal RTX or joint nerve terminals after intraarticular RTX, supports the idea that the therapeutic action of RTX results from a selective chemoaxotomy or nerve terminal inactivation, respectively; the resulting interruption of nociceptive impulse transmission to the spinal cord produces a long-duration analgesic action [ 43 49 5. Actions on TRPV1+ nerve endings When applied in vivo 49 51 50 52–54 55 6. RTX specificity Because noci-responsive TRPV1 + 34 to all of these mediators other sensations are spared in vivo in vitro Figure 3 7. Human tissue studies Determining whether TRPV1 expression changes in humans with OA pain is a most interesting molecular pathophysiology question. Investigating RTX actions at the neuronal level in humans in vivo presents difficulties not encountered in animal models. While investigations of protein/peptide staining of peripheral nerves in OA synovial tissue from knees obtained after total knee replacement surgery have been conducted [ 56–58 56 8. Canine osteoarthritis pain treated with RTX The first demonstration of intraarticular RTX analgesia in a naturally occurring osteoarthritis was in 2018 using the veterinary companion canine model [ 36 59 60 61 Figure 4(a) Figure 4(b) Figure 4. Intraarticular RTX decreases canine osteoarthritis pain. Treatment protocol consisted of conscious sedation with IV propofol to ensure immobility, then an injection of 2 to 3 ml buffered lidocaine (18 mg/ml), followed by 10 micrograms of RTX in 100 microliters of vehicle (7.0% tween 80, 0.05% ascorbic acid in phosphate-buffered saline). Dogs 1–6 were treated unilaterally into the knee joint. Dog 7 was injected into the elbow of the forelimb. (a) increase in force plate measurement is an objective indication of therapeutic action. Increases in weight bearing on the arthritic limb were seen in all dogs treated intraarticularly with RTX. Assessment was made for dogs 2–7 before and at 3 weeks after RTX. No force plate measurements were obtained for dog 1, however, a video of this animal’s response can be seen at: http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A627 36 9. Long-term analgesia with RTX and comparison to anti-NGF antibodies Follow-up in the treated dogs lasted up to 3 years with no apparent deleterious effects on joint function or overall activity or accelerated OA progression, although the N was small. This type of adverse event can occur with repeated intraarticular corticosteroids, and as noted, in some human patients treated with anti-nerve growth factor antibody [ 20 28 62 63 http://links.lww.com/PAIN/A627 10. Results from human clinical trials Results from 3 clinical trials with RTX for OA have been published in abstract form [ 64–66 67 The RTX trials for pain from OA will be examined after reviewing the results from the published study of intraarticular capsaicin. In this clinical trial, the active pharmaceutical ingredient was the naturally occurring trans-capsaicin isomer (CNTX-4975), which was injected intraarticularly into the knee joint [ 37 11. Intraarticular capsaicin I Capsaicin is a very strong TRPV1 agonist, but the binding duration and channel open time are short [ 32 Figures 3 and 4 43 trans 68 n n 68 Parenthetically, this is consistent with previous studies examining the valence and significance of capsaicin injection in human subjects. Activation of the brain pain network was apparent in imaging studies of human brain after subdermal capsaicin injection. Oxygen-15 labeled water PET blood flow studies showed that 250 µg of capsaicin produced pronounced activation of the pain network [ 69 70 Regardless of procedural pain, CNTX-4975 injection was associated with prolonged reduction in OA pain [ 68 12. Intraarticular capsaicin II Subsequently, in the full paper [ 37 64–66 71 72 Table 1 Table 1. Intraarticular capsaicin (CNTX-4975) in human osteoarthritis pain.

Intraarticular resiniferatoxin The three RTX clinical trial abstracts produced results that were roughly similar, with two major exceptions in experimental design ( Table 2 66 64 65 72 and Table 2.

No discontinuations due to AEs or SAEs. This table is based on data in three abstracts [ 64–66 66 14. Duration of action and potential for tissue remodeling In addition to apparent efficacy, what is also compelling is the durability of clinical action after a single injection. Since the basic mechanism is the same, a long duration of action is seen with either RTX or capsaicin. This occurs in both humans and dogs and can last up to a year, although not in every patient. Agonist-mediated overactivation of TRPV1 causes a dying back of afferents nerve endings innervating the joint tissues. In experimental models, the latency to reinnervation can be of variable duration as discussed earlier. Generally, complete reinnervation occurs within a month or less, with restoration of pain sensitivity occurring even earlier as some fibers may regenerate faster than others [ 50 54 55 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 15. Contributions from neurogenic inflammation Another possibility is improved tissue remodeling resulting from prolonged block of neurogenic inflammatory processes. RTX-induced loss of the nerve endings will cause loss of the stores of excitatory amino acids and the neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) present in the peripheral terminals [ 43 49 80–83 76 77 43 73 74 84 74 84 85 86 87–89 16. Comparison to other drugs given IA A full comparison of RTX to other intraarticular drug treatments in OA is beyond the focus of this review. Since RTX is an interventional neurolytic, the most apt comparison are to other interventional approaches such as nonspecific nerve ablation (reviewed in [ 90 48 7 91 20 92 93 92 20 92 93 94 95 57 96 95 97 16.1. Intraarticular BOTOX Another apt comparison would be to other neurotoxic molecules used to control OA pain. One agent that can broadly block transmitter release in joint afferent endings is the botulinum neurotoxin onabotulinum toxin A (BoNT, marketed under the tradename BOTOX). BoNT has been delivered intraarticularly to human OA patients and has demonstrated analgesic actions [ 98–101 98 Euphorbia resinifera 20–22 17. Impact on human health in the USA While intraarticular RTX is not a replacement for major joint arthroplasty, it is possible that substantial savings in health care costs may be realized through effective control of OA pain that, in turn, will delay the need for surgical intervention. Additionally, as all of the current interventions for OA are associated with a significant non-responder rate, the development of mechanistically distinct new interventions provides additional avenues for refractory patients. It might be anticipated that RTX could be implemented for multiple joints at far below the surgical cost range and yield functional improvement without a prolonged postoperative recovery. Recovery after total knee arthroplasty can be between 3 and 6 months and involve multiple physical therapy sessions. The short ~ 1 hour post-injection recovery period after RTX compares very favorably and suggests the possibility of both knees and even several joints being treated in one visit. Furthermore, in patients for whom surgery is contra-indicated, effective pain management with RTX may provide a beneficial alternative to surgical intervention. For example, surgical intervention for painful OA of the wrist often results in appreciable loss of range of motion due to removal of bones [ 102 21 92 93 103 104 105 106 18. Summary In summary, a prolonged analgesic effect from a single injection of RTX is evident in clinical trials of dog and unpublished abstracts from human clinical trials. Although study design factors, such as concurrent use of ropivacaine may influence interpretation of the results, the clinical observations emphasize the promise that can be obtained using a “peripheralist” approach. That is, targeting the primary afferents responsible for pain seems to be a promising path to achieving durable analgesia in human clinical trials of multiple pain types, including OA. The pharmacological selectivity of RTX, the long-duration channel open time, the restricted neuronal expression of TRPV1, combined with local, peripheral administration yield a unique, strong, long-lasting analgesia with no detectable side effects to date, and no action on the central nervous system. In aggregate, RTX is a promising new candidate treatment for OA pain and reinforces the utility of a peripheralist frame-of-reference for development of analgesic agents.
