To report the diagnosis of myiasis larvae invading the oral and nasal cavities of patients in the management of intensive care units and to draw attention to the poor hygiene situation. A 78-year-old male patient diagnosed with cancer and a 93-year-old male patient diagnosed with ischemic cerebrovascular disease were followed up in the intensive care unit. On the 21st day of the cancer patient’s hospitalization, eight larvae were removed from the oral cavity. In the first month of the other patient’s hospitalization, six larvae were seen in the patient’s nasal osteum near the feeding tube. A clinical diagnosis of myiasis was made and the larvae were initially manually removed for treatment, followed by medication. In conclusion, myiasis is a rare condition, but good hygiene, correct diagnosis, and treatment are necessary to prevent further harm to those who have risk factors such as immunosuppression, poor hygiene, malnutrition, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, particularly those who are hospitalized.
