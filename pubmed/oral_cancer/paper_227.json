Objectives This review aims to uncover the provision of PHC services by CPs in LMICs and identify barriers to these services, as well as strategies to overcome them. Methods Medline, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and others were searched for articles published between 2000 and 2022 that reported on CPs’ provision of PHC services in LMICs. Eligible studies were evaluated, and data were extracted and assessed for quality using the mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT). Results Only 13 studies had a high quality rating, less than a quarter ( n n n n n n n n Conclusion Pharmacists in LMICs play a vital role in PHC despite the presence of some barriers. Policies that recognise pharmacists as PHC providers and continuous training could improve their services.

These clinicians are responsible for addressing most personal health care needs, building lasting partnerships with patients, and working within the context of families and communities [ 39 64 112 113 49 168 169 The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities present in healthcare systems of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This has created an urgent need to focus on initiatives that will adequately address the needs of these populations [ 63 149 Community pharmacists play a crucial role in delivering pharmaceutical care services, which are essential for achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Although the involvement of community pharmacists in primary health care (PHC) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has increased in recent years, there remains a lack of recent published systematic reviews addressing these roles [ 6 97 149 174 Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify articles assessing the roles of CPs in primary health care within low- and middle-income countries. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42023357312) and subsequently published in a relevant journal [ 64 100 Search strategy The search strategy was developed in collaboration with two members of the research team (EWH and RNO) and an academic librarian. It focused on studies published in English from January 2000 to December 2022. This timeframe was chosen to encompass research conducted since the United Nations member states declared the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. We believe that these MDGs had a significant impact on the health systems in these regions.

Studies were included if: (i) focused on PHC services by community pharmacists, (ii) published between 2000 and 2022 in language English, (iii) original research, (iv) conducted in community pharmacies in LMICs, and (v) full-text information is available. Exclusion criteria Studies were excluded if (i) Not original research, (ii) not conducted in community pharmacy setting, (iii) published before year 2000, (iv) carried out in high income countries, (v) published in languages other than English. The relevant data from the included studies were independently assessed by the two authors. From these studies, information were extracted based on the specific PHC roles of CPs in the country setting, barriers, and recommendations. The roles of CPs in PHC were reported as delineated by the American Society of Health Systems Pharmacists (ASHP) [ 38 173 Quality appraisal The 2018 version of the mixed method appraisal tool (MMAT) was used to evaluate the quality of the studies included in this systematic review [ 67 43 52 70 124 130 131 134 143 144 68 119 151 Results The database search revealed 84 relevant journal articles [ 1 4 7 9 12 15 19 21 23 24 28 31 35 37 40 45 47 53 55 57 61 62 66 71 73 74 77 79 81 83 87 89 91 93 95 99 102 104 105 108 110 112 114 117 123 125 128 137 139 141 145 146 148 150 152 155 156 158 160 163 165 167 170 175 176 179 1 Fig. 1 Literature search flow diagram Quality appraisal Upon appraisal of quality, four studies were rated as very low quality (MMAT = < 25%), 10 studies were rated as low quality (MMAT = 25—< 50%), 34 studies were assessed to be of moderate quality (MMAT = 50—< 75%), 23 studies were deemed considerable in quality (MMAT = 75—< 100%), and only 13 studies were rated as high quality (MMAT = 100%) (see Appendix).

Three studies highlighted pharmacists activities in promoting the use of facemasks, social distancing, and preparing alcohol-based hand sanitisers for use by the public [ 19 78 55 145 175 61 19 163 141 57 159 Barriers to the Integration of Community Pharmacists in Primary Care Lack of government policies and weak law enforcement. For barriers to effective delivery of these services, 23 studies identified a lack of government policies for the integration of retail pharmacies into the national primary care framework as a major barrier to providing PHCs [ 9 20 24 31 55 77 78 81 87 90 91 104 115 116 127 137 141 146 150 152 155 156 170 62 82 83 99 101 115 Lack of enough time and poor collaboration with other healthcare providers Lack of time was reported as a barrier to PHC activities in nine studies [ 2 7 36 66 74 90 109 114 117 62 66 77 82 83 95 98 99 101 115 Low level of clinical knowledge and ethical dilemma Limited knowledge and specialised training in tuberculosis, asthma, migraine management, antibiotic stewardship, pharmacovigilance during pregnancy, abortion, medication use review, CAM and vaccines were identified by nine studies [ 7 83 87 89 114 138 158 160 176 1 14 117 139 81 87 167 Physical barriers and lack of incentive/reimbursement Two studies indicated that physical barriers within pharmacies are important barriers to CPs providing PHC services [ 7 117 21 66 73 117 9 36 74 Attitude and perception of patients and pharmacists Two studies described patient attitudes [ 34 90 89 110 24 Medicines accessibility challenges Some studies reported the cost of medicines [ 7 23 40 79 94 99 102 145 175 73 112 73 163 45 Recommendations to overcome these barriers Enacting supportive policies and laws To mitigate this barrier eighteen studies recommended enacting policies that would empower CPs to be seen as healthcare providers, especially in the fight against COVID-19 [ 13 29 31 55 73 78 90 91 115 116 116 125 128 152 155 175 Work-flow optimization and task-shifting To tackle persistent workflow and ergonomic challenges in pharmacies, six studies recommended provider-initiated interventions, such as task shifting, the use of technology and the rearrangement of physical structures in the pharmacy to improve workflow and ergonomics [ 2 73 109 115 117 163 Enhancing interprofessional collaboration and public awareness To address the identified barriers, six studies emphasized the importance of fostering effective collaboration among healthcare professionals (CPs), regulatory bodies, and other healthcare providers [ 53 57 81 95 109 137 3 21 24 37 66 87 91 165 170 170 Mandatory continuous professional development (CPD) and integrating CAM into training pharmacists Providing mandatory continuous professional development by regulatory and professional bodies to help keep CPs abreast of the current issues, as related to practice, was advocated in other included studies [ 1 7 29 45 83 89 105 110 114 115 138 152 155 158 160 176 159 Discussion The range of PHC services provided by CPs in LMICs were explored. Eighty-four articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, of which only thirteen studies (14.9%) met the MMAT quality assessment criteria for high-quality studies. Similar outcomes were observed in other mixed methods systematic reviews in which only a few of the included studies met the criteria for a high-quality study [ 133 172 43 The COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged CPs to expand their existing roles and explore new roles. This goes from traditional dispensing to becoming a major stakeholder in patient care, especially in high-income contexts [ 121 65 121 132 Evidence has shown that CP-led medication reviews have a significant impact on reducing drug-related problems (DRPs), especially in elderly people who are known to have comorbidities that may require polypharmacy [ 22 142 166 10 54 88 140 Sexual and reproductive health is an important need that is being targeted by health care providers, especially CPs, since they serve as first-line responders to patient health needs. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period, pharmacists were actively involved in the supply and provision of contraception services to meet demand for such products and services [ 32 96 147 122 122 56 107 56 5 92 122 Some studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of PHC services provided by CPs via improvements in clinical outcomes, such as cardiovascular risk [ 136 16 72 157 177 120 106 33 85 46 51 178 There is evidence from middle- and high-income countries that CPs can be integrated into public health immunisation programmes to improve vaccination rates [ 27 75 59 153 118 Studies have shown that CPs are involved in the referral of patients with chronic diseases to higher health centres [ 21 25 48 50 50 103 In a recent meta-analysis, pharmacist-based interventions led to the optimisation of antibiotic use, and educational interventions were the most commonly used primary care activity to improve the safety and quality of antibiotics (M. [ 82 26 The most common barrier preventing CPs from providing PHC services in this review is a lack of government policies or an updated laws and regulations, such as having old pharmacy laws that do not match the current reality and a lack of standard guidance on providing primary care. The respective governments has engaged health care practitioners in preventing non-communicable diseases, but the specific roles of CPs have not been clearly outlined [ 50 60 154 135 154 101 135 44 86 162 Another barrier is a lack of collaboration with other healthcare professionals, especially physicians. This barrier was delineated in other studies [ 44 86 129 164 171 76 44 44 69 84 11 41 44 58 80 42 50 98 Enhancing the roles of community pharmacists (CPs) in primary care requires continuous pharmacy education (CPE) and supportive government policies. These elements not only empower pharmacists but also improve healthcare delivery in various settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A related study highlighted the need for mandatory professional development in complementary and alternative medicines [ 161 17 To enhance the impact of community pharmacists, policy reforms are needed to officially recognize pharmacists as primary healthcare providers and expand their clinical responsibilities [ 113 18 The major strength of this systematic review is the mixed methods approach without limitations due to the study design. However, this review has several limitations. First, there may be bias in reporting the primary health care practices of community pharmacists in LMICs, which is evident in the relatively few studies included in the review. Second, we limited our systematic review to only scientific articles. There is potential for researchers to be unwilling to publish unfavourable outcomes, and the number of studies indexed in databases in LMICs may be unequal. Third, the presence of few published articles in these regions may not reflect the state of primary care pharmacy practice. This systematic review is also limited due to the use of indexing databases and our search strategy. Conclusion The evidence suggests that community pharmacists in LMICs provide crucial PHC services, the most common being health education, referral of patients to GPs, medication review, point of care testing, self-care for chronic illnesses and promoting access to essential medicines, infection prevention and control measures, health education and triage of suspected COVID-19 patients. The most prominent barriers to these services include a lack of government policies and updated laws, lack of time and reimbursement effective collaboration in patient care, physical barriers and limited knowledge in patient care. To mitigate these barriers, there is a need for a policy framework that would designate community pharmacists as PHC providers and continuous professional development as a way of improving PHC services.
