Combinational therapies are accompanied by severe side effects and significant financial burden, highlighting the urgent need for alternative, low toxicity treatments. This study sought to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of a new synthetic chalcone molecule, SHG-44, and its cellular mechanistic actions in U87MG and U251MG glioblastoma cell line models. Methods The effect of SHG-44 on glioblastoma cell viability, clonogenic survival, and cell migration was assessed using in vitro in-silico Results Cell viability assays demonstrated that SHG-44 significantly reduced cell viability in glioblastoma cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 70.39ΜΜ and 64.19ΜΜ in U87MG and U251MG cells, respectively. In line with these findings, a colony formation assay revealed a significant impairment of glioblastoma cells’ clonogenic survival. SHG-44 effects on cell migration demonstrated a substantial abrogation of cell migration at 100ΜΜ SHG-44 within both glioblastoma cell lines. Cellular reactive oxygen species quantification showed a significant increase of ROS at 40ΜΜ SHG-44 concentrations within U87MG cells and a non-significant elevation of ROS within U251MG cells. Nuclear fragmentation and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining demonstrated that SHG-44 mediated cytotoxicity in U87MG and U251MG through apoptosis induction. Small RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated that SHG-44 could regulate various cellular pathways through microRNA expression modulation in glioblastoma cell models. Further in-silico Conclusion Taken together these findings suggested the potential anti-cancer properties of the newly synthesized chalcone compound, SHG-44 and its dynamic implications in glioblastoma therapeutic management.

The fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) published in 2021 categorizes GB as a grade 4 brain malignancy [ 1 2 Despite advancements in intraoperative guiding imaging technologies that have revolutionized GB surgical resection, achieving gross total resection remains a challenge due to the infiltrative nature of the tumour and indistinct margins within adjacent cortical areas [ 3 4 5 6 Chalcones, a class of unsaturated ketones belonging to the diverse bioactive flavonoid family of polyphenols, exhibit promising anti-cancer properties with potential medical applications [ 7 8 in vitro in vivo 9 10 Furthermore, a recent report has demonstrated that a chalcone derivative from hops named Xanthohumol (XN), kills glioblastoma cells [ 11 To date, there is a vast amount of evidence that altering the expression profiles of deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) within GB rescues the phenotype of cancer cells and seizes tumour growth [ 12 13 14 Our study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of a synthetic chalcone compound, SHG-44, compared to standard first-line chemotherapy in pre-clinical U87MG and U251MG GB cell line models. We further sought to elucidate its cellular mechanisms of action by employing an array of functional assays alongside performing small RNA-sequencing (sRNAseq) to assess its action upon the miRNome of GB cells. We observed a substantial decrease in viability, migration and colony formation in U87MG and U251MG cells when exposed to SHG-44. The compound acted prominently upon the miRNA expression profiles within GB cell models. Methods Chalcone molecule (SHG-44) synthesis and characterisation The reagents and solvents were purchased from Merck and Spectrochem and used without further purification unless otherwise mentioned. The 10% NaOH solution (2.0 ml) was added to a stirring mixture of 4-chloroacetophenone ( 1 2 −1 1 13 3 3 Cell culture and in vitro Two commercially available human GB cell lines, U87MG and U251MG (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in MEM (Minimum Essential Medium; GibcoTM, Bleiswijk, NL) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; GibcoTM, Bleiswijk, NL) and 100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin (GibcoTM, Bleiswijk, NL) to promote growth. All GB cells were authenticated before the start of the experiments and experiments were performed with cells at parage numbers between 20–25. Cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO 2 15 50 15 15 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride staining U87MG and U251MG cells were seeded at a density of 3 x 10 4 RNA extraction and small RNA-sequencing U87MG RNA samples were extracted as described by Braoudaki et al 16 (RIN) numbers greater than seven were sent off for external sRNA-seq to Biomarker Technologies (Biomarker Technologies, Inc., CA, USA). Small RNA library preparation utilized 1.5 Μg RNA per sample via using the NEBNext® Ultra™ Illumina kit (NEB, USA). This involved 3’ and 5’ adapter ligation and reverse transcription. Finally, PCR amplification and size selection enriched for small RNA libraries. Libraries were then clustered and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. Raw data was processed to remove low-quality reads and filter for lengths between 18–30 nucleotides. Clean reads were used for downstream analyses. Reads were aligned against databases to remove rRNA, tRNA, and other non-coding RNAs. Known and novel miRNAs were identified. Differential expression analysis was performed to compare miRNA levels between the DMSO and SHG-44 groups. Gene functions of miRNA targets were annotated using databases like Nr (NCBI non-redundant protein sequences: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/ http://pfam.xfam.org http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/cursos/Leon2002/pages/software/DatabasesListNAR2002/summary/7.html#:~:text=Database%20Description,orthologs%20(direct%20evolutionary%20counterparts https://www.uniprot.org https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html https://geneontology.org RT-qPCR expression analysis MiRNA RT-qPCR was performed as previously outlined by our team [ 15 GAPDH Bcl2 CAS6 In silico To identify the expression profiles of selected miRNAs, we utilized the dbDEMC database ( https://www.biosino.org/dbDEMC/index 17 http://62.217.122.229:3838/app/miRPathv4 18 https://sfold.wadsworth.org/cgi-bin/index.pl 13 19 20 Statistics All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.4.1 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). This software was also used to generate all the figures presented in this study. Unpaired t-tests were employed to assess statistical differences between two groups, while one-way ANOVA/two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-hoc test was used for comparisons among three or more groups. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Interestingly, treatment with high SHG-44 concentrations (60ΜM, 80ΜM and 100ΜM) did not affect ROS levels compared to the control within U87MG cells. However, U87MG cells treated with 40ΜM SHG-44 had significantly increased ROS levels ( p Fig 5A Fig 5B 10.1371/journal.pone.0330624.g005 Fig 5 SHG-44 did not lead to a significant production of ROS release.

(A) (B) (C) Discussion Clinically actionable combination therapies for GB often exhibit promising efficacy in reducing resistant tumour clones [ 4 22 Chalcone compounds, characterized by a 1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-one skeleton, have emerged as potential candidates for cancer therapy due to their diverse biological activities [ 23 In vitro 24 25 The majority of reported chalcone molecules for GB targeting are characterized with polar substituents such as hydroxyl (OH), amine (NH₂) or methoxy (OCH₃) groups on the aromatic or heterocyclic ring of chalcone framework [ 26 27 Our research demonstrated that SHG-44 treatment significantly reduces cell viability, colony formation, and migration, suggesting its potential as an anti-tumour agent against GB. The chalcone molecule, SHG-44 exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity against both U87MG and U251MG cells, with lower IC 50 27 29 S2 Fig S3 Fig While the exact mechanisms of how SHG-44 induces its inhibitory properties require further investigation, some studies have suggested that chalcones can trigger ROS production in cancer cells [ 30 31 31 Current research has demonstrated the pro-apoptotic potential of chalcones in various cancer types, including ovarian, oesophageal, and breast cancers [ 32 34 10 35 36 Further evidence supporting apoptosis induction was demonstrated by the AO/EtBr staining. Treatment with a higher concentration of SHG-44 resulted in increased ethidium bromide uptake by both cell lines, indicating a loss of membrane integrity and late-stage apoptosis or necrosis. Interestingly, 50ΜM SHG-44 appeared to induce early apoptosis in more U251MG cells compared to U87MG cells, suggesting potential differences in apoptotic susceptibility between the two lines. This observation aligns with previous studies demonstrating cell line-specific differences between the U87MG and U251MG cells [ 37 Bcl2 CAS6 We further examined the effects of SHG-44 on the miRNA regulatory network within GB cells, as previous research demonstrated that chalcone compounds could modulate miRNA activity in cancer. TChal, a small molecule trans-chalcone, has presented anti-tumour effects in breast cancer [ 38 38 Our sRNA-seq analysis revealed that the two most downregulated miRNAs in the presence of SHG-44 were miR-122b-5p and miR-223-3p, whilst the three most upregulated were miR-144-3p, miR-5009-5p and miR-664b-3p. To the best of our knowledge, miR-122b-5p has not been previously linked to GB or other brain tumours.

Interestingly, our in silico S1 Table c-Met 40 c-Met S4 Fig TOP2A 41 TOP2A S4 Fig in silico S2 Table S3 Table MiR-5009-5p was among the most upregulated miRNAs following SHG-44 treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this miRNA has not previously been associated with brain tumours, and there is currently no evidence of its expression in GB according to data from the dbDEMC database. However, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that miR-5009-5p may participate in several cancer-related processes, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia, pathways in cancer, and axon guidance ( S2 Table S3 Table RUNX3–MAPK14 42 RUNX3 MAPK14 Our sequencing analysis identified miR-664b-3p as one of the top three upregulated miRNAs in response to SHG-44 treatment, suggesting a potential tumour suppressive role in GB. In silico S1 Table Rheb 43 Rheb Rheb S4 Fig S2 Table S3 Table Our findings highlighted the potential of SHG-44 to broadly influence cellular functions through its effects on miRNA expression. The altered expression of these miRNAs also suggested a potential impact on various biological processes such as axon guidance, which is crucial for neuronal connectivity and communication, and protein degradation, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Additionally, cell adhesion pathways, critical for cell-cell interactions and tissue integrity were also affected. At the molecular level, the deregulated miRNAs were seen to interact with nucleic acids, zinc ions, sequence-specific DNA binding, and protein domain-specific binding. These interactions highlighted the various effects of SHG-44 at the cellular level through miRNAs expression modulation in GBs. Recent evidence has demonstrated that trans chalcones possess the ability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) in a safe manner and to inhibit VEGFR-2 in vivo 44 in silico 45 in-silico Conclusion In summary, the new chalcone compound SHG-44 demonstrated anti-cancer properties via inhibiting cell viability, proliferation and migration within GB cell models. The potential of the compound to modify the levels of GB-associated oncomiRs and tumour suppressor miRNAs was also observed.
