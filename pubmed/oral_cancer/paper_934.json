Introduction Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary genetic disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus Haemophilus influenzae 7 8 9 10 11 12 6 13 Much less is known about the fungal communities present in the lungs of healthy individuals. Based on studies on the bacterial microbiome of the respiratory tract, the healthy lung is believed to host a dynamic, transient, and diverse microbial environment. A balance is maintained between the spread of microbes from the upper respiratory tract into the lungs and the efficiency of the pulmonary microbial clearance mechanisms [ 14 15 Aspergillus Penicillium Cladosporium 16 17 6 13 Studies investigating the composition of the lung mycobiome in respiratory diseases such as COPD, bronchiectasis, and asthma have frequently identified Candida 18 19 Aspergillus fumigatus 20 Candida 21 Candida Aspergillus Scedosporium Exophiala 22 23 24 25 Candida albicans 26 A. fumigatus 24 27 Candida C. albicans 28 Candida Pseudomonas aeruginosa 29 Candida Several factors might influence the chronic colonization of these microorganisms in the respiratory tract of CF patients. Notably, long-term use of inhaled antibiotics, i.e., tobramycin or colomycin, which are standard therapies in CF patients who are chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa Candida 30 Aspergillus 31 In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of both long-term and short-term antibiotic treatment on the mycobiome profiles of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts in patients with CF, compared to healthy individuals. While previous research has primarily focused on the lung or sputum microbiomes, the site-specific impact of antibiotic therapy on fungal communities across different mucosal sites remains underexplored. By analyzing nasal lavage and stool samples, two clinically relevant, non-invasive sample types, we assessed fungal community dynamics during both stable periods and pulmonary exacerbations. To quantify and standardize the cumulative antibiotic exposure, we applied a custom-developed mathematical formula to calculate an equivalence-based score, which allowed us to measure the total antibiotic burden over time. This approach enabled the evaluation of the long-term impact of antibiotic use on mycobiome dynamics in both the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Additionally, we examined short-term shifts in fungal communities by comparing samples collected at the onset of pulmonary exacerbations and after antibiotic therapy. Notably, all samples analyzed in this study were collected between 2018 and 2021, prior to the widespread introduction of the highly effective CFTR modulator triple therapy (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) in Germany in mid-2021. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population and Sample Collection This study included 12 CF patients recruited from the Cystic Fibrosis Unit at the University Hospital Jena (Germany) between 2018–2021 ( Table S1 CFTR Table S2 Sino-nasal samples were collected using nasal lavage, as previously described [ 32 33 2.2. DNA Extraction and ITS1 Region Copy Number Quantification Microbial DNA from nasal lavage samples was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). DNA extraction included two mechanical lysis steps performed on a SpeedMill Plus (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) at 50 Hz for 2 × 3 min cycles. The first lysis step used 1.4 mm zirconium-silicate bead lysing tubes (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA), and was followed by a second step using a mixture of 0.1 mm and 0.5 mm BashingBeads (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) provided in the extraction kit. Subsequent steps were carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA from stool samples was extracted using the innuPREP Stool DNA Kit (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol. An initial mechanical lysis step was added in which lysing tubes containing 1.4 mm zirconium-silicate beads were used (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA). Fungal biomass was quantified by qPCR, using 4 µL DNA template in a 20 µL SYBR-Green reaction (Meridian Bioscience, Billerica, MA, USA) with primers targeting the ITS1 rRNA 2.3. ITS1 Library Construction and Sequencing To investigate the fungal taxonomic profiles in the samples, we performed ITS1 ITS1 ITS2 Table S3 2.4. ITS1 Amplicon Sequencing Analyses Although paired-end sequencing was performed, the analysis of fungal sequences was based solely on forward reads. This decision was made for two main reasons. First, the ITS1 34 35 36 37 2.5. Antibiotic Equivalent Dose Calculation To achieve a standardized and comparable measure of antibiotic exposure across patients, an Antibiotic Equivalent Dose (AED) score was calculated for each individual based on their cumulative antibiotic intake over a three-year observational period. The AED was determined using guideline-recommended standard daily doses for each antibiotic agent, as specified in current national cystic fibrosis treatment guidelines (AWMF 026-018) [ 38 Tables S4 and S5 Antibiotic  Equivalent  Dose  units = daily  patient  intake  mg · d − 1 rec .  daily  dose  mg · kg − 1 · patient  weigt  kg · treatment  duration  d 2.6. Correlation Analysis and Statistics The R package ‘vegan’ (v. 2.6.4) was used to assess multivariate homogeneity of group dispersion, which was done through the betadispr function. Comparison of beta diversity metrics between groups was performed using the PERMANOVA statistical test. Pearson correlation analyses between fungal relative abundance and clinical parameters were analyzed with the ‘stats’ (v. 4.3.0) and ‘ggpubr’ (v. 0.6.0) R packages. Fungal co-occurrence network analysis was performed using the SparCC method, implemented in the ‘SpiecEasi’ R package (v. 1.1.3), with 100 bootstrap iterations. Network visualizations were created using Gephi software (v. 0.10.1). Inter-group comparisons were conducted using unpaired t p 3. Results Sino-nasal and stool samples from 12 CF patients were collected at three time points: before and after an acute pulmonary exacerbation and during a stable phase three months post-antibiotic treatment. For comparison, nasal lavage and stool samples were collected from healthy controls. Unless otherwise specified, the analyses of fungal community dynamics were performed using CF samples collected during the stable phase. 3.1. Increase Fungal Biomass and Distinct Microbiome Diversities in CF Nasal Lavage and Stool Samples Compared to Healthy Individuals The fungal biomass was quantified by measuring the ITS1 p p Figure 1 The fungal microbiome diversity was assessed using alpha and beta diversity metrics. Analysis of alpha diversity in the CF nasal lavage samples revealed a significantly lower Shannon index, reflecting both taxa richness and evenness, compared to that of healthy individuals ( p p Figure 2 p p Figure 2 3.2. Significant Increased Relative Abundance of Candida spp. in CF Samples Compared to the Healthy Cohort Analysis of the taxonomic fungal composition in nasal lavage and stool samples revealed differences in the relative abundance (RA) of several taxa between CF patients and healthy individuals ( Figure 3 Candida Debaryomyces Cladosporium Cladosporium Candida Mrakia The stool samples from CF patients were primarily colonized by Saccharomyces Candida Cryptococcus Saccharomyces Cryptococcus Penicillium To evaluate differences in fungal taxonomic composition, an analysis of the differential composition of microbiomes with bias correction (ANCOMBC) revealed a significantly increased RA of Candida Figure 3 Saccharomycetales Cladosporium Table S6 Penicillium Mrakia Given the significantly increased RA of Candida Candida Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus 3.3. Long-Term Effect of Cumulative Antibiotic Intake Correlates with the Presence of Candida spp. in CF Nasal Lavage Samples To accurately quantify the cumulative antibiotic exposure of each patient over a three-year period, we developed a novel and standardized metric, the Antibiotic Equivalent Dose (AED), which enables direct comparison of individuals’ antibiotic intake across different treatment regimens ( Table S5 Candida Table 1 Candida Candida Candida Other clinical parameters, such as modulator therapies, spirometry measurements (FEV1%), and chronic bacterial colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus Candida Candida Table S7 3.4.

Discussion This study analyzed sino-nasal lavage and stool samples from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy controls to assess the impact of antibiotic treatments on fungal communities in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. To investigate the long-term effects of antibiotic exposure, we recorded all antibiotic treatments over a three-year period and developed a mathematical metric termed Antibiotic Equivalent Dose (AED). Additionally, longitudinal samples from patients with CF were analyzed to assess short-term changes in the mycobiome before and after antibiotic therapy for an acute pulmonary exacerbation episode. Samples collected during the stable phase were examined for their fungal biomass, diversity, and community structure and the influence of cumulative antibiotic exposure on the mycobiome. The fungal biomass was significantly elevated in both the nasal and stool samples from the patients with CF. However, only the nasal samples exhibited reduced alpha diversity and distinct community structures. Candida Candida Candida Fungal communities in the respiratory tract have long been considered transient colonizers. However, recent studies have provided evidence that the respiratory tract is permanently colonized by these microorganisms [ 15 39 40 41 40 42 43 44 45 Candida Candida 46 47 48 Candida albicans 49 Candida We further investigate clinical factors that potentially influence Candida Candida 50 51 52 Candida 53 54 Candida Candida 30 Candida 55 Candida 56 57 58 59 60 Candida While the pathogenic role of Candida Candida 11 61 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 62 63 64 Candida 65 66 Candida Candida Candida Candida Fungi are common colonizers of the healthy human gut, where they contribute to maintaining homeostasis [ 67 68 Saccharomyces Penicillium Cryptococcus 69 70 Saccharomyces Candida Candida 71 72 Saccharomyces Candida Saccharomyces Candida Saccharomyces boulardii Candida albicans 73 Figure S3 Candida Table S8 Candida Alternaria Cladosporium Candida Saccharomyces Our study has several limitations, including a relatively heterogeneous patient age range, including both pediatric and adult patients with CF.
