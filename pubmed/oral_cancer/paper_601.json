Objective This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and personalized treatment strategies for proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID). Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical features, pathological characteristics, and treatment regimens of three PGNMID patients. Conclusion Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits patients commonly present with proteinuria, hematuria, and renal insufficiency. Pathologically, light microscopy predominantly reveals a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) pattern, with IgG3κ being the most prevalent immunohistochemical subtype. Current guidelines recommend the BCD regimen (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone) as first-line therapy. Daratumumab may be a safe and effective therapeutic option for PGNMID; however, clinical decision-making should comprehensively consider patient age, renal function status, treatment tolerance, and other factors. proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits glomerulonephritis daratumumab case report proteinuria The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Hematology Introduction Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID) is a rare renal disease belonging to the spectrum of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). Its hallmark feature involves glomerular deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein), which mediates immune complex formation and subsequent tissue injury ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Since the initial systematic description of the disease by Nasr et al. ( 3 8 9 Against this background, the present study reviews three illustrative cases of PGNMID with distinct clinical presentations and treatment pathways: one managed conservatively, another treated with a bortezomib-based regimen, and a third achieving sustained remission with daratumumab after relapsing following initial chemotherapy. By integrating these case-based observations with current literature, we aim to explore individualized therapeutic strategies for PGNMID and to inform its clinical management. Case presentation Case 1 A 14-year-old male presented with “increased urinary foam for 3 days” without identifiable triggers. Outpatient urinalysis revealed urine protein 3+ and urine occult blood 3+. No previous special medical history. Physical examination showed stable vital signs and no significant abnormalities. Laboratory investigations Serum creatinine was 49.44 μmol/L, eGFR: 149.2 mL/ min/1.73 m 2 Renal biopsy diagnosis The biopsy confirmed proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits (IgG3-λ). Pathological findings: Light microscopy revealed 46 glomeruli with moderate to severe mesangial expansion, increased mesangial cells and matrix, segmental narrowing of capillary loops, and focal thickening/layering of the glomerular basement membrane. PASM-Masson staining identified scattered fuchsinophilic deposits in the mesangium and subendothelial regions. Mild acute tubular-interstitial injury with sparse mononuclear cell infiltration was observed, while arterial structures appeared unremarkable ( Figure 1 Figure 2 FIGURE 1 Renal biopsy findings.

Treatment Since March 2024, a conservative observation strategy has been adopted, and chemotherapy has not been initiated. The patient has received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment primarily focused on renal protection using Bailing capsules/tablets ( Cordyceps sinensis Case 2 A 60-year-old male presented with “head distension accompanied by nausea, vomiting, bilateral lower limb edema, and increased foamy urine for 1 day” without identifiable triggers. Past medical history included hypertension for over 30 years (maximum blood pressure 200/110 mmHg, controlled to 150/90 mmHg with oral antihypertensives) and saphenous vein varicosity surgery 15 years prior. Physical examination showed stable vital signs (blood pressure 160/80 mmHg), mild bilateral lower limb edema, and no other significant abnormalities. Laboratory investigations revealed Serum creatinine 113 μmol/L, eGFR: 66.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 Renal biopsy diagnosis Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (IgG3-κ). Pathological findings Light microscopy revealed 10 glomeruli with moderate to severe diffuse hyperplasia of mesangial cells and matrix, accompanied by endothelial cell hyperplasia, lobulated capillary loops, luminal narrowing/occlusion, thickened basement membrane, mesangial interposition, and double-contour formation. Mesangial and subendothelial eosinophilic deposits were observed without significant parietal epithelial cell hyperplasia or crescent formation. Tubular epithelial vacuolar and granular degeneration, focal atrophy (∼15% area), interstitial focal inflammatory cell infiltration with fibrosis, and vascular lesions (segmental arteriolar hyalinosis and small arterial wall thickening with luminal narrowing) were noted. Immunofluorescence showed IgG+++, IgA−, IgM+, C3+++, IgG1−, IgG2−, IgG3+++, IgG4−, κ+++, and λ−, with diffuse granular deposits in the mesangial area and capillary loops. Electron microscopy demonstrated segmental glomerular basement membrane thickening, partial foot process effacement, mesangial interposition, electron-dense deposits in mesangial and subendothelial areas, and occasional subepithelial deposits. Treatment The patient initiated BCD therapy (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 2 2 Case 3 A 72-year-old male was admitted due to “proteinuria detected for over 6 years.” During a routine physical examination in 2018, urine protein 2+ was noted without bilateral lower limb edema; the patient did not seek further evaluation or treatment at that time. In February 2023, the patient developed facial and bilateral lower limb edema following exertion. Laboratory tests revealed serum albumin 31 g/L, serum creatinine 110 μmol/L, eGFR: 57.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 Renal biopsy diagnosis Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal gammopathy (κ type). Pathological findings Light microscopy revealed 10 glomeruli, including 1 ischemic sclerotic glomerulus (10%), with the remaining glomeruli exhibiting diffuse lesions characterized by moderate to severe cellular hyperplasia and mesangial matrix expansion, accompanied by extensive interposition and mild endothelial cell hyperplasia, along with hyaline degeneration. Congo red staining was negative. Immunofluorescence showed IgG+++, IgA+, IgM−, C3++, C1q−, FRA+, IgG1−, IgG2−, IgG3−, IgG4−, κ++, and λ± with petal-like deposits along capillary walls and granular deposits in the mesangial area. Electron microscopy demonstrated moderate to severe mesangial cell and matrix hyperplasia, segmental interposition, segmental double-contour formation in the basement membrane, electron-dense deposits in mesangial, subendothelial, and segmental subepithelial regions (some with uneven density), and extensive effacement of podocyte foot processes. Tubular findings included vacuolar degeneration of epithelial cells with increased lysosomes, partial loss of microvilli, and shed cellular debris in some tubular lumens. Interstitial changes comprised mild lymphomonocytic infiltration with collagen fiber hyperplasia. Bone marrow morphology and flow cytometry were unremarkable. Serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis were negative. Serum free light chains: κ 51.40 mg/L, λ 28.19 mg/L (κ/λ ratio 3.14). The patient had a 1-year history of hypertension. Treatment Initial treatment The patient initiated BCD therapy (bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 Subsequent treatment Given the short-term relapse following prior BCD therapy discontinuation, treatment was switched to the Dd regimen (daratumumab 800 mg per dose: administered weekly for 8 doses, then biweekly for 8 doses, with the regimen adjusted to monthly maintenance starting from the 17th dose; combined with dexamethasone 20 mg). A sustained complete response was achieved within 2 months of initiating the Dd regimen. The patient has now been followed up for over 1 year, remains asymptomatic, and maintains serum creatinine and 24-h urine protein excretion levels within normal ranges. Renal histopathological examination results and treatment of the three patients are summarized in Table 1 TABLE 1 Renal histopathological examination results and treatment in three patients.

Discussion Analysis of treatment strategies and decision-making rationale The three PGNMID cases in this series received distinct therapeutic regimens, reflecting a risk-adapted and clone-informed individualized treatment approach that aligns with the high heterogeneity of the disease. Case 1 was a 14-year-old male with clinical features including young age, preserved renal function (eGFR 149.2 mL/min), relatively low-level proteinuria (<1.5 g/day), negative serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis, no evidence of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow examination, and the absence of active pathological lesions such as crescents in renal tissue. Based on these low-risk and low disease-activity characteristics, a conservative management strategy was adopted. The patient received traditional Chinese medicine focused on renal protection, primarily consisting of Bailing capsules/tablets (active component: Cordyceps sinensis 10 11 Cordyceps 4 12 Case 2 was a 60-year-old male who presented with high disease activity, including nephrotic-range proteinuria (4.55 g/day) and mild renal impairment (eGFR 66.1 mL/min). Accordingly, a bortezomib-based BCD regimen was selected for targeted treatment. The patient achieved complete remission, consistent with the known mechanism of proteasome inhibitors in eliminating plasma cells and suppressing M-protein secretion through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, among other effects ( 13 Case 3 presented a more complex clinical course. This 72-year-old male initially responded to the BCD regimen; however, shortly after treatment was discontinued, the disease relapsed (within 2 months) with rapid progression to nephrotic-range proteinuria, suggesting a potentially resistant or high-risk disease phenotype. Renal biopsy immunofluorescence showed prominent IgG (+++) and κ light chain (++) deposits, whereas all IgG subclasses (IgG1–4) were negative and λ light chain expression was suppressed (±). This unusual staining pattern suggests that the glomerular deposits may not consist of intact IgG molecules. Instead, they are more likely composed of structurally abnormal immunoglobulins, such as pathogenic species made up of heavy-chain fragments (possibly lacking functional domains like CH2/CH3) associated with κ light chain ( 14 15 16 17 Key implications Based on the experience from this case series and supporting literature, the following key implications emerge for the clinical management of PGNMID: (1) Treatment decisions should integrate both clonality and clinical disease activity. For patients with detectable serum M-protein or a confirmed clone, the goal should be hematologic complete response (CR). In seronegative patients, as exemplified in this cohort, the decision to initiate intensive treatment should be guided primarily by clinical disease activity, such as proteinuria > 3.5 g/day, progressive decline in renal function, or the presence of active pathological lesions. (2) Pathological findings may inform therapeutic choices. Immunofluorescence results on renal biopsy are not only critical for diagnosis–specific staining patterns may also reflect structural characteristics of the pathogenic immunoglobulin and provide insight into differential treatment responses, potentially guiding regimen adjustments (e.g., switching from a proteasome inhibitor to an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody). (3) Treatment tolerance and relapse prevention warrant careful attention. Dose individualization and regimen modifications are essential in elderly patients or those with significant comorbidities. The relapse observed in Case 2 underscores that patients who achieve remission but have high-risk features–such as impaired baseline renal function, slow response to induction therapy, or previous relapse–may benefit from low-intensity maintenance strategies (e.g., reduced-dose or less frequent bortezomib, or extended intervals of anti-CD38 antibody administration) to mitigate the risk of recurrence. (4) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration is essential. Given the diagnostic challenges and frequent seronegativity in PGNMID, close collaboration among renal pathology, hematology, and laboratory medicine is crucial. Integrating pathological findings with clinical information enhances diagnostic accuracy and supports informed treatment decision-making. Pathogenic mechanisms and clinical implications The core pathogenesis of PGNMID involves glomerular deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein) and subsequent complement activation, triggering inflammatory responses that result in glomerular injury. Recent studies have proposed novel insights into its mechanisms: (1) Complexity of clonal origin: Approximately 70%–80% of PGNMID patients show no detectable M-protein or pathogenic B-cell clones in circulation, suggesting that deposited immunoglobulins may originate from occult small clones (below conventional detection thresholds) or oligoclonal activation (where some supposed “monoclonal” deposits may in fact represent convergent deposition of oligoclonal antibodies) ( 18 19 The unusual immunofluorescence pattern–strong IgG positivity with complete subclass negativity–observed in Case 3 may be attributed to the following mechanism: polyclonal anti-IgG antibodies, which recognize multiple epitopes, can bind to truncated heavy chains and produce a positive signal, whereas monoclonal antibodies against specific conformational epitopes of IgG subclasses fail to bind due to the absence of critical functional domains (e.g., CH2/CH3) ( 14 Therefore, when encountering similar immunofluorescence patterns (e.g., strong glomerular IgG staining with negativity for all subclasses) or patients resistant to first-line therapy, the possibility of aberrant immunoglobulin deposition should be considered. Such cases may be more effectively managed with treatment strategies directly targeting plasma cells (such as anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies) rather than conventional regimens focused solely on secreted immunoglobulins. Although PGNMID typically features deposits of intact IgG, pan-negative IgG subclass staining suggests underlying structural variations and highlights the importance of further molecular pathological analysis in such cases ( 20 Future directions and limitations Although targeted therapies have significantly improved outcomes in PGNMID, several unresolved issues remain: (1) optimal treatment duration and maintenance strategies for novel agents such as CD38-targeted antibodies; (2) methods for monitoring treatment response in patients lacking serological biomarkers; (3) the applicability of emerging therapies–including CAR-T cells and bispecific antibodies–in refractory cases; and (4) the need for prospective studies and rigorous evidence-based evaluation of traditional agents, such as those used in Case 1. This study has several limitations. The small sample size (only three cases) and the relatively short follow-up period together limit the generalizability of our findings. Furthermore, the relatively short follow-up period precludes a comprehensive assessment of long-term outcomes, such as the sustained renal function, the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease, and long-term treatment safety. Therefore, the observations presented here should be regarded as preliminary; further validation through larger, multicenter cohort studies is needed to confirm the efficacy of these individualized treatment strategies. Conclusion In summary, this case series of three patients with distinct clinical features of PGNMID illustrates the application and preliminary outcomes of personalized treatment strategies based on risk stratification, disease activity, and renal biopsy characteristics. However, due to the limited sample size and short follow-up period, these findings should be considered exploratory. Optimized management of PGNMID remains dependent on validation through larger, well-designed prospective studies.
