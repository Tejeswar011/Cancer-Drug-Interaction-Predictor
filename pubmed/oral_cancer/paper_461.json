This study aimed to determine swallowing abnormalities in post-COVID-19 patients with OD and to determine the potential risk factors of aspiration in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Screening for OD was done for 310 patients who were discharged from the main university isolation hospital during the study period. A longitudinal descriptive study was carried out on 127 adult post-COVID-19 patients between the ages of 24 and 65 years who failed OD screening at the time of discharge. Instrumental swallowing assessment was done using fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) at one of two different time points: one-week post-discharge (Group 1) and 3–4 weeks post-discharge (group 2). The prominent swallowing abnormalities were delayed triggering of swallowing reflex, laryngeal penetration, tracheal aspiration, as well as vallecular and pyriform sinuses residue with lower frequencies and milder degrees in group 2 than in group 1 patients. Statistically significant associations were found between the presence of ageusia and anosmia in post-COVID-19 patients and both impaired laryngeal sensation and delayed triggering of the swallowing reflex. Significant associations were detected between aspiration in post-COVID-19 patients and the following factors: higher Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) scores, presence of dysphonia, higher respiratory rate, and the longer duration of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The combined higher EAT-10 scores and higher respiratory rate predicted aspiration in post-COVID-19 patients by an overall percentage of 87.1% Keywords Post.COVID-19 Oropharyngeal Dysphagia FEES Mansoura University Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread worldwide. It is due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 COVID-19 patients, especially those with moderate-to-severe disease, experienced OD not only during but also after recovery from the disease [ 8 9 10 11 10 12 13 The EAT-10 is recommended as a simple and quick screening measure for OD. \"The EAT-10 may be utilized as a clinical instrument to document the initial dysphagia severity and monitor the treatment response in persons with a wide array of swallowing disorders\" [ 14 15 Due to their increased risk of respiratory issues, the swallowing efficiency and safety of COVID-19 survivors must be evaluated carefully [ 16 17 Subjects and Methods Subjects A descriptive longitudinal study was carried out on 127 adult post-COVID-19 patients who failed OD screening at discharge from the main university isolation hospital from July 2021 to March 2022. According to the isolation hospital policy, all patients were admitted with severe or critical illness. Severe illness was defined as individuals who had an oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO 2 18 Methods All participants underwent the following assessment protocol at the time of discharge from the hospital: (A) Patient history:  - Demographic information (name, age, and gender). - Medical history: including history of previous OD, neurological disorders such as stroke, or head and neck cancer. COVID-19 infection was established in the admitted patients by detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Patients with respiratory clinical syndrome consistent with acute infection were included in the study. - Present history: including length of hospital stay, ageusia, anosmia, and dysphonia, as well as duration and method of delivery of oxygen therapy (Conventional oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and IMV). (B) Clinical examination: this involves evaluating the patient's respiratory status by measuring heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry. (C) Screening for OD with the Arabic version of the \"Eating Assessment Tool\" (EAT-10)” [ 19 15 - - The \"Yale swallow protocol\" (bedside swallowing assessment) involved three items: I. Brief cognitive screen. II. Oral mechanism examination. III. The patient had a 3-oz water swallow test, the results of which were evaluated based on the following standards: \"PASS\": Drinking 90 ml (3 oz) of water entirely and continuously without exhibiting overt aspiration signs, such as coughing or choking, during or right after the task. \"FAIL\": The patient stopped/started swallowing before finishing the whole 3 oz or showed overt aspiration signs, such as coughing or choking, during or right after the task. Adequate precautions were taken during the bedside swallowing assessment to avoid transmission of infection to the clinician. The phoniatrician was positioned at the patient's side, maintaining a distance of about 2 m [ 20 1 Fig. 1 Flowchart of patient enrollment/exclusions and assessments (D) Instrumental swallowing assessment: - It was performed through fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). FEES was done using fiberoptic nasendoscopy “Henke-Sass-Wolf, type10” linked to a Lemke video camera (MC204) and software for recording and retrieving recorded materials. Personal protective equipment was used during the FEES. - FEES Examination protocol [ 21 Part 1: Anatomic- physiologic assessment: A. Visualization of pharynx and larynx at rest: B. Secretions and how they were handled: - The quantity, location, and reaction of the patient to secretions were noted over 2 min. - The Murray secretion scale (MSS) [ 22 - C. Laryngeal function during both respiration and phonation. D. Sensory testing: - Laryngeal sensation was examined using the touch method, which involved touching the arytenoid cartilages by the tip of the flexible laryngoscope. The laryngeal sensation was considered to be grossly intact if any of the following signs were observed: laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR), a cough, a gag, eye blinking, tearing, throat clearing, swallowing, or a patient’s report of feeling the touch [ 23 Part 2: Swallowing food and liquid: During FEES, boluses with varying volumes and consistencies tinted green using a coloring agent were used: fluids (3 ml, 5 ml, 10 ml, and cup drinking), puree food (10 ml yogurt), and solid food (half biscuit) with two trials for each consistency. The patient's clinical status and swallowing function were considered when selecting the appropriate boluses. If aspiration occurred twice with any bolus amount or consistency and compensatory strategies failed to eliminate aspiration, these boluses were deemed unsafe for the patient. - Swallowing function during FEES was assessed using two standard rating scales from video recordings: The penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) [ 24 25 Part 3: Therapeutic interventions: Compensatory interventions were combined with \"part 2\" and trialed as soon as applicable. These included postural techniques, bolus modifications, and behavioral adjustments (e.g., washing down residue with liquid). Statistical analysis IBM SPSS software, version 22.0, was used to input and analyze data. Numbers and percentages were used to describe the qualitative data. Quantitative data were characterized using the median (minimum and maximum) for non-parametric data and the mean and standard deviation for parametric data. Acquired results were deemed significant at the (0.05) level. The Chi-Square test was employed to compare two or more groups. For parametric tests, two independent groups were compared using the student t-test; for non-parametric tests, two independent groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. The study employed stepwise logistic regression analysis to forecast independent variables associated with a binary outcome. In the univariate analysis, significant predictors were entered. Results 1- Descriptive data of the entire group: This study was carried out on 127 patients, including 81 females (63.8%) and 46 males (36.2%) in the age range of 24–65 years (mean 55.2 ± 9.43). At the time of hospital discharge, 42.5% of the patients had dysphonia, and 15.7% had aguesia and anosmia. The range of hospital stay of patients was 4—42 days (median = 8 days). Conventional oxygen therapy was delivered for 34 patients, NIV for 86 patients, and only seven received IMV (Table 1 2 Table 1 Demographic and basic data of the entire group (N = 127) Mean ± SD/Median (Range) Age (Years) Mean ± SD 55.2 ± 9.34 (Range) (24–65) Oxygen saturation Mean ± SD 95.34 ± 2.56 (Range) (86–99) Respiratory rate Mean ± SD 20.5 ± 2.21 (Range) (14–24) Duration of hospital stay (in days) Median (Range) 8.0 (4–42) Number (%) Gender Male 46 (36.2%) Female 81 (63.8%) Aguesia and anosmia 20 (15.7%) Dysphonia 54 (42.5%) Oxygen therapy Conventional oxygen therapy 34 (26.8%) Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) 86 (67.7%) Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) 7 (5.5%) Table 2 Type of respiratory support received by COVID-19 severity categories (N = 127) COVID-19 severity category Respiratory support Conventional oxygen therapy (COT) Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) Severe illness 34 (27%) 58 (46%) – Critical illness – 28 (22%) 7 (5%) 2- Results of instrumental swallowing assessment of patients: a) Group 1: Out of the 127 discharged patients in our study who screened positive for oropharyngeal dysphagia, 41 patients (32.3%) were discharged with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR. The mean hospital stay duration in this group was 17.2 ± 9.5 days. Thirty-seven out of these 41 patients (90.2%) were admitted to the ICU (mean duration of ICU stay was 14.4 ± 7.3 days). This group included the seven patients who received IMV. Patients were evaluated by FEES within one week after the date of discharge. At the time of FEES, 26 patients (63.4%) received their nutrition via a nasogastric tube (NGT), and 14 continued feeding through an NGT following the FEES examination. Pooling of secretions before the introduction of the first bolus was found in 15 patients (36.6%), with 26.7% (4 out of 15) having consistent secretions in the laryngeal vestibule (grade \"4\" on the Murray rating scale). Tracheal aspiration was evident in 25 patients (61%), with 20% (5 out of 25) being silent aspirators (grade 8 on PAS). Aspiration mainly occurred on fluid boluses. Vallecular and hypopharyngeal residue was a salient finding in a majority of patients. It mainly occurred after the intake of puree and solid food boluses and was more common in the vallecula than in the pyriform sinuses. Thirty-five patients (85.4%) had residue in the vallecula, scoring grade 2 or more, according to MFRRS. In comparison, 24 patients (58.5%) had residue in the pyriform sinuses scoring grade 2 or more according to MFRRS (Table 3 Table 3 FEES findings in post-COVID-19 patients (n = 80) Group 1 (G1) N = 41 Group 2 (G2) N = 39 (A) Anatomic-physiologic findings Number (%) Murray secretion scale (MSS) * Score 1 26(63.4) 39(100) * Score 2 6(14.6) 0(0) * Score 3 5(12.2) 0(0) * Score 4 4(9.8) 0(0) VF immobility (Unilateral) 9(22) 6(15.4) Laryngeal sensation Intact 25(61) 38(97.4) Impaired 16(39) 1(2.6) (B) Swallowing findings Number (%) Delayed triggering of the swallowing reflex 25(61.0) 5(12.8) Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) * Score 1 1(2.4) 26(66.7) * Score 2 4(9.8) 2(5.1) * Score 3 2(4.9) 2(5.1) * Score 4 8(19.5) 1(2.6) * Score 5 1(2.4) 2(5.1) * Score 6 11(26.8) 6(15.4) * Score 7 9(22.0) 0(0) * Score 8 5(12.2) 0(0) Penetration 15(36.6) 7(17.9) Aspiration 25(61.0) 6(15.4) Vallecular residue scale (MFRRS) * Score 0 6(14.6) 6(15.4) * Score 1 0(0) 15(38.5) * Score 2 10(24.4) 16(41.0) * Score 3 10(24.4) 2(5.1) * Score 4 6(14.6) 0(0) * Score 5 6(14.6) 0(0) * Score 6 3(7.3) 0(0) Pyriform sinus residue scale (MFRRS) * Score 0 7(17.1) 18(46.2) * Score 1 10(24.4) 18(46.2) * Score 2 13(31.7) 3(7.7) * Score 3 3(7.3) 0(0) * Score 4 4(9.8) 0(0) * Score 5 2(4.9) 0(0) * Score 6 2(4.9) 0(0) b) Group 2: Out of the 127 discharged patients, 86 (67.7%) were discharged with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Out of these 86 patients, 17 dropped out, and 69 continued the study. All patients in this group received COT or NIV. Their mean hospital stay was 15.1 ± 5.9 days. They were re-evaluated by swallowing screening tools at a post-COVID-19 clinic in the university hospital 3–4 weeks after discharge. Thirty (43.5%) patients passed swallowing screening tools (EAT-10 total score < 3 and passed Yale swallow protocol) with no further assessment done. FEES was done for 56.5% of patients (39 out of 69) (EAT-10 total score ≥ 3 or failed Yale swallow protocol), with the mean hospital stay duration for these 39 patients being 14.8 ± 7 days. 64.1% (25 out of 39) were admitted to the ICU with a mean duration of (6.84 ± 5.3 days). Tracheal aspiration was evident in only 6 patients (15.4%) with no silent aspirators. 16 patients (41%) had vallecular residue post swallowing “grade 2 (Shallow pooling),” and only 2 patients had “grade 3 (Moderate pooling),” according to MFRRS. Residue in the pyriform sinuses was found in only 3 patients who had grade 2 (Shallow pooling), according to MFRRS (Table 3 3 Compared to patients without aspiration, patients with aspiration had a significantly higher respiratory rate, required noninvasive and/or invasive mechanical ventilation for a more extended period, and had higher EAT-10 scores. Additionally, the percentage of patients with dysphonia was considerably higher in the aspiration group. 32.7% of patients who received NIV (18 out of 55) had aspiration, while 85.7% of patients who received IMV (6 out of 7) had aspiration (Table 4 Table 4 Comparison between patients with aspiration and patients without aspiration Patients without aspiration n = 49 Patients with aspiration n = 31 Test of significance Age (Years) t = 1.68 Mean ± SD 57.61 ± 8.83 54.09 ± 9.52 P = 0.096 Gender Male 18(36.7%) 14 (45.2%) χ 2 Female 31(63.3%) 17 (54.8%) P = 0.454 Duration of hospital stay (in days) z = 0.470 Median (Range) 13(4–34) 14(6–42) P = 0.638 Aguesia and anosmia Absent 40(81.6%) 20 (64.5%) χ 2 Present 9(18.4%) 11 (35.5%) P = 0.085 Dysphonia Absent 24(49.0%) 2 (6.5%) χ 2 Present 25(51.0%) 29 (93.5%) P < 0.001* Respiratory rate t = 2.53 Mean ± SD 20.86 ± 3.03 22.58 ± 2.88 P = 0.014* EAT-10 score 5(3–12) 15(3–18) z = 4.81 Median (Range) P < 0.001* NIV/IMV No 11(22.4%) 7 (22.6%) χ 2 NIV 37(75.5%) 18 (58.1%) P = 0.025* IMV 1(2.0%) 6 (19.4%) Duration of NIV/IMV (Days) 6(2–21) 14(7–32) z = 4.43 Median (Range) P < 0.001* Tests used: (t) = Student t-test, (χ2) = Chi-Square test, (z) = Mann–Whitney U test, *P < 0.05 = statistically significant, NIV IMV Data expressed as mean ± SD, Median (Range) or as frequency (Number-percent) SD 4- Association between the presence of ageusia and anosmia, laryngeal sensation, and triggering of swallowing reflex: Significant associations were found between the presence of ageusia and anosmia, impaired laryngeal sensation, and delayed triggering of the swallowing reflex (Table 5 Table 5 Relation between the presence of aguesia and anosmia, laryngeal sensation, and triggering of the swallowing reflex Aguesia and anosmia Test of significance Absent N = 60 Present N = 20 Laryngeal sensation: Intact 54 (90.0%) 9 (45%) χ 2 Impaired 6 (10.0%) 11(55%) P < 0.001* Triggering of swallowing reflex: Intact 46 (76.7%) 4 (20.0%) χ 2 Delayed 14 (23.3%) 16 (80.0%) P < 0.001* Test used: (χ2): Chi-Square test * 5- Risk factors of aspiration in post-COVID-19 patients: Significant associations were observed between aspiration in post-COVID-19 patients and the following factors: higher EAT-10 scores, presence of dysphonia, higher respiratory rate, and the longer duration of the use of NIV and/or IMV. A higher EAT-10 score was associated with a 1.31 higher incidence of aspiration, and every 1-day increase in the duration of NIV and/or IMV use increased the risk of aspiration by 1.09. Multivariate analysis revealed that the combined higher EAT-10 scores and higher respiratory rate were considered significant risk factors, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.31 and 0.57, respectively. The overall percentage of predicted aspiration by both factors was 87.1% (Table 6 Table 6 Univariate and multivariate analyses of the aspiration risk factors Variables Total number N = 80 Aspiration Univariate analysis Multivariate analysis p Crude Odds ratio (95% CI) p Adjusted Odds ratio (95% CI) Absent (N = 49) Present (N = 31) Age (Years) Mean ± SD 80 57.61 ± 8.83 54.09 ± 9.52 0.101 0.959(0.912–1.01) Gender Male 32 18(36.7%) 14 (45.2%) 0.454 1.42(0.568–3.54) Female( R) 48 31(63.3%) 17 (54.8%) Length of hospital stay (Days) Median (range) 80 13(4–34) 14(6–42) 0.179 1.04(0.983–1.09) Ageusia and anosmia Absent (R) 60 40(81.6%) 20 (64.5%) 0.089 2.44(0.871–6.86) Present 20 9(18.4%) 11 (35.5%) Dysphonia Absent (R) 26 24(49.0%) 2 (6.5%) 0.001* 13.92(2.99–64.83) 0.094 7.53(0.707–80.09) Present 54 25(51.0%) 29 (93.5%) Respiratory rate Mean ± SD 80 20.86 ± 3.03 22.58 ± 2.88 0.017* 1.22(1.04–1.44) 0.028* 0.573(0.349–0.941 EAT-10 score Median (Range) 80 5(3–12) 15(3–18) < 0.001* 1.42(1.22–1.66) 0.002* 1.31(1.25–1.9) NIV/IMV No (R) 18 11(22.4%) 7 (22.6%) 0.079 1 NIV 55 37(75.5%) 18 (58.1%) 0.633 0.764(0.254–2.30) IMV 7 1(2.0%) 6 (19.4%) 0.058 9.43(0.927–95.88) Duration of NIV/IMV (Days) Median (Range) 80 6(2–21) 14(7–32) < 0.001* 1.24(1.11–1.39) 0.270 1.09(0.931–1.29) Overall % predicted = 87.1% Modelχ 2 R * NIV IMV Discussion Recovery profiles for COVID-19 patients with OD and its prevalence are unknown, although some reports suggest it may be frequent [ 26 27 17 17 28 In the current study, 43.5% of post-COVID-19 patients who were re-evaluated by swallowing screening tools at 3–4 weeks post-discharge passed OD screening and did not require instrumental swallowing assessment. Notably, these patients received either conventional oxygen therapy or NIV during their hospital stay. This finding could be due to the self-limiting nature of dysphagia among non-intubated patients with COVID-19, as reported by Grilli et al. [ 29 30 Statistically significant associations were found between the presence of ageusia and anosmia in post-COVID-19 patients and both impaired laryngeal sensation and delayed triggering of the swallowing reflex. This could be explained by the fact that swallowing, a nutritional process that involves the oral preparatory phase, depends on the interplay of several senses, such as taste and smell. Taste, in particular, contributes to the perception of different consistencies, functionality of protective reflexes, and oropharyngeal motor response [ 31 32 33 Tracheal aspiration is a significant contributing factor to aspiration pneumonia. In patients with COVID-19, aspiration can worsen their already compromised lung function [ 34 35 36 12 37 38 39 In post-COVID-19 patients, it appears crucial to assess swallowing function by screening tools as part of routine care, ideally early on, before starting oral intake, to prevent complications associated with OD. Because of the high rate of pooling of secretions in the hypopharynx, silent aspiration, and residues, FEES is recommended in patients who fail OD screening. Limitations Findings must be interpreted in the context of the following limitations: First, there is a lack of longitudinal follow-up for the recovery pattern of dysphagia in the same group of patients across time. Evaluating the same patients at several intervals and more extended follow-up periods would provide more information regarding dysphagia progression and recovery. Second, considering the multifactorial nature of dysphagia in our patients, it was not possible to separate the effect of COVID-19 disease on swallowing function. The adjusted odds ratio was estimated in order to account for the confounding factors. Third, there is a lack of information about the dysphagia characteristics, evolution, and recovery in the dropout cases as well as in the group of patients who failed the screening after discharge and had a positive PCR, then later passed the screening after their PCR turned negative. We acknowledge the lack of our missing data handling before the initial analysis to address the potential bias introduced by dropouts, which could impact our findings. Fourth, compensatory therapies may not directly alter the anatomical or physiological features observed during FEES but can improve swallowing safety and efficiency over time. Such improvement could mask underlying physiological deficits that were more apparent in the absence of therapy. As stated by Newman et al. [ 40 Conclusion Swallowing assessment of the post-COVID-19 patients using FEES revealed several swallowing abnormalities at both the initial post-discharge evaluation and the subsequent follow-up evaluation. The combination of the following risk factors, “higher EAT-10 scores and higher respiratory rate,” predicted aspiration in post-COVID-19 patients by an overall percentage of 87.1%.
