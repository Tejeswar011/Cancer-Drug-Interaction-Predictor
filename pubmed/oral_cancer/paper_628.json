See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Male breast disorders, though less prevalent, present unique diagnostic challenges that differ significantly from their female counterparts. While benign entities such as gynecomastia are predominant, the risk of underlying malignancy, often diagnosed at an advanced stage, highlights the need for a systematic, image-guided assessment. Ultrasound and mammography are the first-line complementary tools, with magnetic resonance imaging reserved for problem-solving. This review outlines the anatomical, pathological, and radiological nuances of the male breast, describing crucial red flag signs, sonographic pitfalls, and mammographic mimics that aid in distinguishing benign entities from sinister pathologies such as invasive ductal carcinoma. Given the increasing visibility of transgender individuals, this review also addresses imaging considerations and screening recommendations tailored to this population. By integrating clinical insights with radiologic imaging, this review offers a comprehensive approach to both common and not-so-common male breast lesions, with an emphasis on an algorithmic stepwise diagnostic approach.

Most of these lesions are benign and present as tender, painful, palpable breast masses. Breast cancer, on the contrary, has a very low incidence in males and presents at an advanced stage as a hard, painless mass. Red flag symptoms, such as nipple discharge, bleeding, and a fixed breast mass, which are often encountered in females, are rarely seen in male patients. Even if they occur, they are present only at a late stage. As malignant lesions are relatively uncommon in male breasts, screening mammography is not recommended in men. Ultrasound and mammography are the first-line complementary investigations performed for a male patient with suspicious breast findings[ 1 2 Data in this review was reported after conducting a detailed search in PubMed and EMBASE databases from inception till June 2025. The search was conducted using the terms “male breast” AND “imaging” OR “radiology”. Data were extracted from studies describing the imaging appearances of male breast lesions, including case reports, original articles, and review articles. Studies with pure histopathological and/or surgical descriptions of male breast lesions were excluded. This article examines the common and not-so-common lesions in male breasts and proposes a diagnostic algorithmic approach. Furthermore, the characteristic sonographic and mammographic features of male breast pathologies are described. MALE BREAST VS FEMALE BREAST At birth, the mammary glands are structurally identical in males and females. The breast extends from the anterior second rib superiorly to the anterior sixth rib inferiorly and from the sternum medially to the midaxillary line laterally. In neonates, mild gynecomastia is a common, transient condition resulting from the transplacental transfer of maternal estrogen before birth. In females, during the prepubertal phase, estrogen promotes ductal proliferation, branching, and growth, whereas progesterone drives stromal development and the maturation of terminal ductal–lobular units. In males, however, the surge in testosterone levels leads to ductal involution and atrophy[ 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 Figure 1  Diagrammatic representation of male vs Table 1 Comparative differences in male vs   Male breast  Female breast Anatomy Breast composition Predominant adipose tissue with atrophic/sparse subareolar ductal elements, lacks terminal ductal lobular units Adipose tissue with abundant ductal elements, varies with hormonal status and age Lobular development Absence of lobular development Well-developed lobular anatomy Structural supports Minimal to no stromal architecture, absence of Cooper’s ligaments Well-developed Cooper’s ligaments Imaging approach Mammography for age ≥ 25 years, Ultrasound < 25 years, or if mammography is indeterminate Mammography screening ≥ 40 years, ultrasound adjunct for dense breast Mammography Smaller breast with radiolucent fatty tissue and prominent pectoralis muscle Larger breast with variable radiographic density depending relative composition of fat and fibroglandular tissue Sonography Only homogeneous fat lobules Variable sonographic echotexture depending upon relative composition of fat and fibroglandular tissue Magnetic resonance Limited role, evaluation of chest wall involvement or disease extent, post-surgical evaluation High risk screening, dense breast evaluation, preoperative disease extent, neoadjuvant therapy response assessment, indeterminate diagnosis Pathologies Benign Most common Gynecomastia (nodular, dendritic, diffuse). Fibroadenoma and cysts are extremely uncommon Fibroadenoma and cysts are commonly encountered Well circumscribed hypoechoic mass may be malignant Well circumscribed hypoechoic mass generally points towards benign pathology Malignant Histological subtypes Invasive ductal carcinoma > papillary carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma is not seen in men Invasive ductal carcinoma > invasive lobular carcinoma, broader histological spectrum then men Age Diagnosed at a later age (60-70 years) Usually 40-50 years, early age of onset in high risk females Axillary node involvement Higher due to advanced stage at presentation Relatively at an advanced stage, increases with tumour size and grade Age-adjusted survival rate[ 17 Almost similar Almost similar Overall prognosis[ 17 Worse due to delayed diagnosis Relatively better due to screening and early stage diagnosis Mammography High density irregular mass with spiculated margins Predominantly subareolar location.

Guidelines for high risk men[ 64 65 Variable guidelines[ 7 19 ROLE OF IMAGING IN DIAGNOSING MALE BREAST DISORDERS Universal consensus on the diagnostic imaging algorithm for male breast lesions is lacking. If clinical findings indicate gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia, no further imaging is required. Nonetheless, mammography is advised when cancer is suspected[ 7 8 9 Mammography Mammography is often the first-line investigation in male patients presenting with a palpable breast mass[ 7 10 11 11 12 2 Table 2 Classification of male breast lesions on the basis of mammographic abnormalities (margins)   Well circumscribed margins  Not well circumscribed (microlobulated/indistinct/spiculated obscured) Skin and subcutaneous tissue Hematoma Hematoma Fat necrosis Fat necrosis Epidermal inclusion cyst Sebaceous cyst Hemangioma Venous or lymphatic malformation Nipple areola complex and retroaerolar region Nodular gynecomastia Dendritic gynecomastia Subareolar abscess Subareolar abscess Fibroadenoma Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia Papilloma Parenchyma Papillary carcinoma Papillary carcinoma Lymphoma Invasive ductal carcinoma Lipoma Invasive lobular carcinoma Diffuse involvement/multiple masses Lymphoma Pseudogynecomastia Diffuse gynecomastia Mastitis Venous/Lymphatic malformation Metastases Points needing special attention Mammography can accurately differentiate gynecomastia from breast carcinoma[ 13 5 11 7 8  Sonography: 11 2 14 16 3 Table 3 Classification of male breast lesions on the basis of sonographic abnormalities (echogenicity)   Hyperechoic  Hypoechoic  Complex echogenicity Skin and subcutaneous tissue Lipoma Hemangioma Fat necrosis Venous/Lymphatic malformation Hematoma Epidermal inclusion cyst Sebaceous cyst Hematoma Nipple areola complex and retroareolar region Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia Nodular gynecomastia Dendritic gynecomastia Subareolar abscess Subareolar abscess Fibroadenoma Mastitis Papilloma Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia Parenchyma Diffuse gynecomastia Invasive ductal carcinoma Papillary carcinoma Invasive lobular carcinoma Papillary carcinoma Lymphoma Metastases Points needing special attention As cysts are extremely uncommon in male breasts[ 17 18 17  MRI: 19 20 21 Points needing special attention ACR has deemed MRI as “usually not appropriate” across all categories of male patients with symptomatic breasts[ 7 et al 22 22 2 Figure 2  Diagrammatic representation of various male breast lesions according to their location. BENIGN LESIONS Most lesions identified in a symptomatic male breast fall under this category. These lesions range from gynecomastia (the most common entity in male breasts) to infectious conditions, such as mastitis and benign tumors. Non-neoplastic entities  Pseudogynecomastia: 23 1 3 Figure 3 Pseudogynecomastia: Mediolateral oblique mammography view of a 17-year-old obese male showing a diffuse bilateral increase in fat density. Gynecomastia Gynecomastia is the most common benign pathology in male breasts and is characterized by the proliferation of ductal and stromal elements. This condition is the routine cause of a palpable abnormality in the male breast and can be unilateral, bilateral, symmetric, or bilaterally asymmetric[ 24 1 13  Nodular gynecomastia: 24 4 Figure 4  Nodular gynecomastia in a 62-year-old male with tender subareolar masses in bilateral breasts.  Dendritic gynecomastia: 1 18 25 26 25 27 5 Figure 5  Dendritic gynecomastia in a 69-year-old male with a tender soft mass in the left breast.  Diffuse gynecomastia: 1 18 25 26 28 6 Figure 6  Diffuse gynecomastia in a 42-year-old male on estrogen therapy. Epidermal inclusion cyst These cysts occur frequently in men, representing the third most common benign lesion of the male breast. These develop due to hair follicle obstruction or other traumatic events, such as an insect bite or surgery. These are characteristically located beneath the skin in the periareolar region, inframammary fold, and axilla. The size varies, and the cysts appear as a round palpable mass. The glandular orifice is seen as a black dot on the patient‘s skin surface (pore sign)[ 29 11 13 13 7 Figure 7  Epidermal inclusion cyst breast in a 23-year-old male with a palpable nodule and a history of blunt trauma to the chest. Hematoma and fat necrosis These often occur as tender palpable masses in the setting of trauma to the male breast. Like hematomas anywhere else in the body, these appear as fluid collections of mixed echogenicity (ranging from hyperechoic to hypoechoic and anechoic with the progression of time) with irregular or ill-defined margins in the subcutaneous plane on ultrasound. Mammographic findings vary depending on the lesion’s stage. In the acute phase, it may present as a poorly defined mass with skin thickening and prominent trabecular patterns. However, as it progresses to the chronic stage, it becomes more clearly defined and may show fat–fluid levels. At this stage, mammography may reveal distortion, rim calcification, and well-circumscribed masses. On ultrasound, the lesion typically appears as a circumscribed, complex, heterogeneous mass that lacks vascularity and may exhibit features such as fluid–fluid levels and internal septations[ 1 28 30 8 Figure 8 Fat necrosis in a 23-year-old male who suffered trauma to the right breast by football shows an irregular hyperechoic area with indistinct margins (white arrows) containing few anechoic areas. Mastitis with an evolving abscess Mastitis is an infection or inflammation of the breast tissue that occurs most commonly in the subareolar region of men. Ductal obstruction with a keratin plug results in inflammation and superinfection, leading to abscess formation. The causative organisms are usually bacteria such as staphylococci or, less commonly, streptococci. Patients show local signs of inflammation like pain, erythema, heat, skin thickening, and edema. On mammography, mastitis may be associated with skin and trabecular thickening along with asymmetries, which aid in the diagnosis[ 29 1 31 9 10 32 37 Figure 9  Mastitis with abscess in a 61-year-old diabetic male with a tender enlarged breast. Figure 10  Infective collection from a 23-year-old male with a history of high-grade fever after trauma to the left breast. Pilomatricoma These unusual lesions arise from primitive matrix cells of the hair bulb and are rare in the male breast. Repeated skin trauma is the primary etiological factor. These lesions are also called “calcifying epitheliomas of Malherbe” and represent benign soft tissue tumors in the subcutaneous plane. On mammography, these appear as well-circumscribed calcified lesions, sometimes mimicking fibroadenomas, with dense calcifications being their hallmark. Ultrasound often reveals isoechoic to hyperechoic lesions with calcifications and distal shadowing[ 38 38 39 40 11 Figure 11  Pilomatricoma in a 33-year-old male with a palpable left breast mass. Venous malformation Vascular lesions are uncommonly found in the male breast and range from hemangioma to venous and lymphatic malformations[ 1 1 12 Figure 12  Venolymphatic malformation. Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a benign proliferative condition that may lead to the development of a solid mass[ 6 15 13 35 13 Neoplastic entities The radiologist must be aware of the numerous benign tumors encountered in the male breast. A few of the important ones have been discussed here.  Lipoma: 16 23 36 13 37 38 13 14 15 24 Figure 13  Lipoma in a 34-year-old male with a palpable mass in the axilla. Figure 14  Giant lipoma in a 52-year-old male with a palpable nontender mobile mass in the left breast. Figure 15  Intrapectoral lipoma in a 45-year-old male with a palpable mass in the left breast.  Myofibroblastoma: 38 13 39 16 Figure 16  Myofibroblastoma in a 56-year-old male with a palpable mass in the right breast.  Intraductal papilloma: 40 5 41 17 Figure 17  Intraductal papilloma in a 46-year-old male with a palpable abnormality. MALIGNANT LESIONS Carcinoma of the male breast accounts for a mere 1% of new breast cancers detected and just 0.17% of all cancers in males[ 13 17 42 1 43 44 49 BRCA1 BRCA2 45 Invasive ductal carcinoma The most common type of cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma, accounting for approximately 80% of the cases, followed by ductal carcinoma in situ, which is seen in approximately 5% of the cases[ 50 41 51 Mammography often reveals an irregular, high-density, subareolar eccentric mass, with associated findings such as skin thickening, nipple retraction, or axillary lymphadenopathy[ 18 52 53 13 52 54 11 16 28 50 11 28 53 18 19 Figure 18  Ductal carcinoma in situ in a 69-year-old male with a palpable lump in the left breast. Figure 19  Invasive breast cancer in a 74-year-old male with a hard lump in left breast. Invasive lobular carcinoma Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is extremely rare in the male breast, primarily due to the high levels of testosterone at puberty, which inhibits lobular development. A potential association with Klinefelter’s syndrome has, however, been reported due to relatively high estrogen levels and an altered androgen-to-estrogen ratio in the affected individuals[ 55 56 57 58 20 Figure 20  Invasive lobular carcinoma in a 65-year-old male with a hard retroareolar lump. Papillary carcinoma It is the second most common invasive cancer in male breasts and occurs more often in males than in females, presenting with bloody nipple discharge[ 59 60 53 61 21 Figure 21  Papillary carcinoma in a 54-year-old male with a hard mass in left breast. Lymphoma Primary lymphoma of the breast is a rare entity and is infrequently seen in both male and female breasts[ 16 62 22 Figure 22  Lymphoma in a 43-year-old male after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Based on the role of each radiological modality and the imaging features of commonly encountered lesions, a systematic imaging approach to male breast assessment is furnished in Supplementary Figure 1 SCREENING OF HIGH-RISK PATIENTS Patients with a personal history of male breast cancer and a known genetic mutation are at a high risk of breast cancer, and for such individuals, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends annual mammography[ 63 BRCA1 BRCA2 64 66 7 61 Supplementary Figure 2 IMAGING IN TRANSGENDER MALES The term transgender encompasses all patients whose gender identity or expression is different from the one they were born with[ 67 68 69 70 According to the 2021 ACR Appropriateness Criteria, average-risk transfeminine individuals (assigned male at birth) who have received at least 5 years of feminizing hormone therapy may be considered for screening mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) from 40 years of age. Those with BRCA For transmasculine individuals (assigned female at birth), the presence or absence of breast tissue is the primary determinant of the screening need. Those having an average risk of < 15% and who retain native breast tissue, including patients with no chest surgery or who have undergone reduction mammoplasty, should follow standard female screening guidelines, including annual mammography from 40 years of age. Mammography or DBT is appropriate for transmasculine individuals > 30 years of age with no chest surgery or reduction mammoplasty who are at intermediate risk, such as those with atypia, lobular neoplasia, or a 15%–20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. High-risk individuals (> 20% lifetime risk) may warrant initiation at 25–30 years of age, with adjunct MRI where appropriate. Routine screening is not recommended for those who have undergone a bilateral mastectomy (“top surgery”). Gender-affirming mastectomies are often subtotal, especially in the axillary region, to preserve the chest contour, leaving behind some residual breast tissue that can still develop malignancy. Although direct data are not available for transmasculine individuals, extrapolation from high-risk cisgender women suggests that the risk of breast cancer after prophylactic mastectomy is under 2%, which is comparable to the low risk in transgender men post–top surgery. However, supporting evidence for routine breast cancer screening in this population using mammography, tomosynthesis, ultrasound, or MRI is currently lacking[ 71 75 These evolving guidelines highlight the need for a risk-based, anatomy-informed, and gender-affirming approach to breast imaging in transgender populations[ 69 73 23 67 Figure 23 Craniocaudal mammogram of a transfeminine (male to female) individual showing bilateral silicone implants with smooth margins and no signs of rupture. CONCLUSION Male breast lesions are uncommon and present unique challenges. Radiologists must be vigilant in identifying the imaging features of gynecomastia and distinguishing it from other conditions, such as breast cancer. The overlap in clinical and imaging findings between benign and malignant pathologies necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including mammography, ultrasound, and, when required, tissue sampling. The male breast remains an understudied and underreported topic, with limited addressal of diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic pathways, despite a surge in the incidence of male breast cancers. Furthermore, with the increasing awareness of transgender individuals, their unique breast cancer risks and screening guidelines must be understood. Continued education and personalized care are vital for the accurate diagnosis and management of male breast lesions, improving the outcomes across all patient populations.
