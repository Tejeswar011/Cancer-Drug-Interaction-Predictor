Wastewater-based surveillance provides a promising means to relate trends in microbial community antibiotic resistance profiles as a function of interventions and other factors. We examined influent sewage metagenomes for two neighboring wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving a university and a nearby community. We compared antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles as a function of diagnoses of COVID-19 and other illnesses, antibiotic use, antibiotic/antimicrobial and disinfectant/quaternary ammonium compound concentrations, and COVID-19-related behavioral shifts. Diversity and abundances of ARGs unique to the corresponding sewage were consistently higher for the community WWTP, but converged in 2022 when antibiotic prescriptions surged in the university zip code. Decreases in ARG diversity/abundance were not apparent during periods of decreased antibiotic usage, indicating that extended times may be required for wastewater ARG signals to attenuate following interventions.

Antibiotics were often prescribed to prevent secondary bacterial infections that might arise from respiratory distress or other co-morbidities. For US hospitals in February-March 2020, >70% of COVID-19 patients were administered at least one antibiotic, with 81% of prescriptions commencing immediately upon admission 18 19 21 n 18 11 22 24 25 26 Increased hygiene vigilance was initially a logical intervention to mitigate COVID-19.

To our knowledge, no other study has compared metagenomic WBS to their community prescription data, particularly at the resolution of this study. The COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique opportunity to achieve this goal through analysis of the sewage resistomes of two neighboring small towns experiencing distinct shifts in antibiotic and antimicrobial usage before, during, and in the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The confirmed relationship observed between clinical COVID-19 cases and measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage validated our general sampling and monitoring approach and also revealed different patterns of illness in the adjacent communities (Fig. S1 Through examination of regional and campus prescription data, it was found that outpatient antibiotic use dropped precipitously in both communities in the early stages of the pandemic (Fig. 1 51 52 53 We observed a steady increase in outpatient antibiotic prescriptions during the autumn and early winter each year, with peak antibiotic prescription rates in 2022 being comparable to pre-pandemic levels. Data from the university health center showed an increase in URI diagnoses in 2022 (Fig. S4 S2 S5B S6 2A S12 S15 17 S6 S6 S15 3 S17 Metagenomic sequencing provided a comprehensive comparison of the compositions of the resistomes between the two communities over time (Fig. 3 4 S6 Deshpande and colleagues 41 qacE 2B 38 5 54 S7 2B S12 This study provides general insight into how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected AMR in human populations and in sewage. It appeared that, despite sharp declines in antibiotic prescriptions in 2020 for both zip codes (Fig. 1 3 4 1 3 55 While this study was able to evaluate a wide array of hypothetical factors (e.g., outpatient and inpatient prescription of antibiotics, measurements of antibiotics and QACs in wastewater, wastewater quality), it is possible that a key driver of observed ARG patterns in sewage was overlooked. Findings of this study could help guide more focused, mechanistic studies, e.g., towards characterizing microbial ecological processes altering the resistome in the human gut versus the sewer and differentiating effects of selective pressure and HGT. Assembling the metagenomic data can also bring resolution regarding which bacteria are carrying which ARGs and their responses to changes at the sewershed scale that can be examined in further studies 56 This study took a key step in advancing metagenomic-based WBS as a viable approach for assessing temporal trends and filling key data gaps regarding ARG carriage across human populations and evaluating efficacy of potential interventions. Metagenomic sequencing was applied to the sewage from two neighboring towns to comprehensively profile sewage resistomes during a period when major shifts in antibiotic and antimicrobial use occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was unique in its application of longitudinal, deep, metagenomic sequencing paired with acquisition of antibiotic prescription data in the region and direct testing of the sewage for antibiotics and QACs. Overall, it was found that the community with higher historical rates of outpatient prescriptions also carried a higher diversity of ARGs and had a greater number of unique ARGs, even when outpatient antibiotic use dropped during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. QAC genes were widely networked with ARGs and MGEs across multiple bacterial hosts, demonstrating potential for elevated QAC use to elevate ARGs in the sewage. This study suggests that stewardship practices should consider both antibiotics and antimicrobials/disinfectants used for hygiene purposes and that significant periods of time might be required for ARGs to attenuate across human-associated microbial communities following the implementation of stewardship practices 46 Methods Site description and sampling The university and community WWTPs (receiving 22,712 and 11,356 m 3 Starting August 28, 2020 (1 week after the semester began) through May 7, 2021 (last week of spring semester), 24-h flow proportional composite influent samples were collected from each WWTP after bar screening using an ISCO 5800 (Teledyne Inc., Louisville, KY) sampler maintained at 4 °C. Samples were collected twice weekly, such that one sample was representative of the weekend (7:00 a.m. Sunday–7:00 a.m. Monday) and one was representative of the workweek (7:00 a.m. Thursday–7:00 a.m. Friday). Grab samples from the community WWTP collected in 2017–2018 57 57 58 WWTP operational conditions (flow) and some wastewater physiochemical parameters (pH, total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were determined by the WWTP staff. Ammonia and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured at Virginia Tech using HACH methods 8000 and 8155 (Loveland, CO) 59 60 Climate data were downloaded from the National Climatic Data Center’s archive 61 SARS-CoV-2 RNA analysis Sample concentration for RNA extraction followed previously described methods 62 63 2 2 64 SARS-CoV-2 genes ( N E 65 Clinical data on COVID-19, other infections, and antibiotic use COVID-19 clinical case data per zip code were shared by the Virginia Department of Health (VDH). Cases were documented as either the date that the case was reported to VDH, the date of illness onset, or the date that a test was conducted. Where available, symptom onset date was implemented in the analysis; otherwise, the test date followed by the date reported was used. Information regarding antibiotic use and positive COVID-19 infections was shared by the university health center. Information regarding inpatient and outpatient antibiotic prescriptions was shared by Carilion Clinic, which widely serves Southwest Virginia. Wastewater samples were concentrated onto 0.22-µm filters for DNA extraction. Filtration was carried out until the filters clogged, and the final volume filtered was recorded (24–180 mL). DNA was extracted using the FastDNA™ SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) following manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extracts were subjected to library preparation and sequencing at the Duke University Center for Genomic and Computational Biology using a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA), targeting approximately 36 Gbp per sample of 2 × 150 paired-end reads. Illumina short reads were processed together with previously sequenced samples 57 66 67 -10 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 −10 https://github.com/clb21565/mobileOG-db/blob/main/scripts/getElementClassifications.R To identify known hosts of QAC resistance genes, the gene sequences for qacE qacEdelta1 qacL qacH 75 76 77 qac qac qac qac S7 Antibiotics and QACs To minimize external sources of contamination and preserve integrity for pharmaceutical and personal care product analysis, grab samples for analysis of antibiotics and antimicrobials were collected in acid-washed, methanol-rinsed glass amber bottles in 2020 (September, November, and December) and 2022 (March, April) for a total of eleven influent samples collected at each WWTP. Following solid phase extraction, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used for non-target analysis according to EPA method 1694 78 S8 An additional nine influent samples were collected at both WWTPs for targeted quantification of six QACs: benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride (C12-BAC), benzyldimethyltetradecylammonium chloride (C14-BAC), benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium chloride (C16-ABAC), dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (C18-DDAC), octyl decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (C20-DDAC), and dodecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (C22-DDAC) using LC/MS/MS as described in detail in the SI (Tables S9 S10 The study was deemed exempt by the Carilion Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB-22-1775) as it is not categorized as human subjects research, as it included only de-identifiable prescription data. Data analysis and statistics All statistical tests were conducted in R (v 4.1.3) 79 p t 80 Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between clinical cases and SARS-CoV-2 RNA, QAC resistance genes and bacterial families, antibiotic prescriptions and ARG classes, antibiotic prescriptions and antibiotic agents, and ARG classes and antibiotic agents.
