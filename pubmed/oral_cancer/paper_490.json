We investigated the short-term effects of melatonin treatment for 14 consecutive days in the cryptorchidism model. We categorized experimental mice into Sham (S), Orchiopexy (O), Melatonin (Mel), and Orchiopexy + Melatonin (OMel) groups. Surgery involved inducing cryptorchidism in the left testis for seven days, followed by orchiopexy. The Mel group’s testes did not descend, but they received melatonin injections after seven days of cryptorchidism. The OMel group underwent both orchiopexy and melatonin treatment. Both O and Mel groups exhibited decreased sperm and round-headed sperm in the epididymis.
