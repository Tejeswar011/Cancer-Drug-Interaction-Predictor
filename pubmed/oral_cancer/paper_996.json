Despite the development and spread of mutate viruses, HIV protease remains an important pharmacological target. In the development of new HIV protease inhibitors, heterocyclic fragments have proven to be of great importance, owing to their rigid core structure, which may fit better into the enzyme’s hydrophobic pockets, and the presence of a heteroatom, which may increase the number of H-bonding interactions at the active site. According to the concept of targeting the protein backbone, different aromatic or non-aromatic heterocyclic moieties have yielded inhibitors with sufficient activity against mutant viruses. This paper provides an overview of HIV protease inhibitors developed over the last fifteen years, with a focus on the presence of heterocycles in their structure, either in the core or on the side chains, which are crucial for their activity. The rationale behind the design of these new inhibitors, as well as the key synthetic steps involved in their preparation, is also described.

Introduction HIV-1 is the virus responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is characterized by an attack and disruption of CD4+T cells, with the consequence of significant vulnerability in humans against different types of infection. This lentivirus integrates irreversibly into the host genome and has a long incubation period, being able to infect non-dividing cells [ 1 2 Among the many strategies used to combat the disease, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is considered the most effective current treatment, and it is characterized by a combination of HIV protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and/or an integrase inhibitor. Recently, capsid inhibitors, such as Lenacapavir, have shown potential for a long-acting administration regimen [ 3 HIV protease plays a crucial role in the viral lifecycle, being essential for the generation of mature, infectious viral particles [ 4 5 Although no new protease inhibitors have been approved or used in a clinical trial since 2007 [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 This review focuses on the main advances in the synthesis of new heterocyclic HIV protease inhibitors during the last 15 years and in the synthesis of key heterocyclic fragments [ 14 2.

A spirocyclic dioxolane derivative from D 27 3 Scheme 9 26 (S)-Glyceraldehyde was used as a chiral source by Ghosh in the convergent synthesis of various substituted bis-THF derivatives, to find new HIV-protease inhibitors with enhanced binding capacity [ 27 bis 30 Scheme 10 31 O 3 4 33 bis 3 36 33 3 p 34 36 bis 37 More recently, Ghosh described a new approach to bis-THF alcohol 3 28 O 38 39 Scheme 11 39 Saturated ester 40 41 3 2 3 42 m 42 Regarding sugars as chiral pool materials, Sridhar developed a stereoselective synthesis of carbohydrate-derived perhydrofuro[2,3- b 29 bis 3 O 43 Scheme 12 44 45 46 4 47 b 50 bis 3 p 3 The potassium isocitrate, obtained from high-yielding fermentation fed by sunflower oil, was the starting material for the preparation of bis-THF alcohol 3 Scheme 13 30 bis With the aim of creating a new class of inhibitors with improved pharmacological and drug-resistance profiles, Ghosh described the synthesis of a 6–5–5 ring-fused crown-like tetrahydropyranofurans and their incorporation into new potent inhibitors [ 31 32 57 A Scheme 14 2 2 59 ee 60 4 60 61 exo 4 64 Shortly afterwards, this fragment was incorporated into new arylboronic derivatives, and they were tested against highly drug-resistant HIV-1 variants [ 33 Alternatively, the Diels–Alder reaction of cyclopentadiene with chiral 3-(acyloxy)acryloyloxazolidinone derivatives was later used for the synthesis of 6-5-5 fused crown-like THF ligands ( Scheme 15 65 66 67 63 34 An optically active (1 R R S aR 35 meso 69 70 Scheme 16 28 71 72 73 73 74 75 More recently, a modified procedure was described [ 36 70 76 70 3 3 Scheme 17 Stereoselective syn 76 2 4 3 6 syn 77 78 syn 74 The synthesis of enantiomerically pure (3aS,4S,7aR)-hexahydro-2H-furo[2,3-b]pyran-4-ol 83 37 80 Scheme 18 A more recent alternative route has been proposed, starting from inexpensive materials and taking advantage of highly enantioselective enzymatic desymmetrization of a meso 38 84 3 Scheme 19 ent 85 86 o n m 87 exo 83 Various C3-functionalized cyclopentanyltetrahydrofurans (Cp-THF) were prepared and combined with hydroxyethylsulfonamide isosteres to obtain new inhibitors with high antiviral activity, including against a panel of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants [ 39 R R 92 93 89 90 Scheme 20 R 91 92 93 Novel oxatricyclic ligands were designed and synthesized by Ghosh to enhance interactions with the protease backbone [ 9 101 syn anti syn Scheme 21 40 94 95 endo 96 96 97 98 97 99 syn anti syn 100 Gem 41 102 Scheme 22 103 n 104 105 Reduction of the Weinreb amide 105 106 3 107 bis 108 To maximize the ligand-binding site interactions in the protease active site, Ghosh described cyclohexyl-derived ligands within a 6-5-5 fused ring system [ 42 Starting from 1,3-diketone 109 110 3 2 111 Scheme 23 111 4 endo 112 114 113 114 113 115 50 Novel isosorbide scaffolds were proposed by Liu as P2 ligands of HIV-1 protease inhibitors bearing the hydroxyethylamine core 116 Scheme 24 43 117 118 p 2 119 120 Chiral 4,4-dimethyltetrahydrofuran-3-ol was prepared by Srinivasa Reddy and used for the synthesis of new amprenavir analogs [ 44 122 Scheme 25 123 3 2 Different O 45 130 126 Scheme 26 129 m 130 131 Flexible macrocycles between the P1′-side chain and a suitable P2′-ligand were proposed by Ghosh to broaden the activity of the inhibitor by achieving a better fit in the S2 hydrophobic pocket, which increases in size upon certain mutations [ 46 134 i 50 Scheme 27 138 135 136 3 i 4 137 one pot 2 138 The P2 fragment was synthesized as 3-hydroxy-2-alkenylbenzoic acid from maleic anhydride 140 141 142 3 4 Scheme 28 144 2.2.

Recently, the Konvalinka group screened a variety of chemical structures for inhibition of HIV replication [ 51 166 o 162 164 165 166 Scheme 33 R R S S 50 New bioactive compounds containing 1,4-benzodiazepine scaffolds were proposed by Fletcher, with the most potent compound, 167 Scheme 34 52 168 169 170 171 170 N 167 The tetrahydropyridine ring system is a widely distributed structural framework involved in numerous pharmaceuticals and natural products.

Recently, Mikamiyama [ 55 182 Figure 2 50 α The five membered hydantoin scaffold was already recognized as a key fragment in HIV protease inhibitors.

Kappe and his group developed multistep continuous flow reaction method for the synthesis of the biaryl-hydrazine unit of atazanavir [ 71 A useful method was developed by Lindhardt and Skrydstrup for the synthesis of active esters by palladium-catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of (hetero)aromatic bromides ( Scheme 48 72 N 252 Quinoline and isoquinoline moieties have been extensively studied as scaffolds for HIV inhibition and have been recently reviewed [ 73 74 259 Scheme 49 50 254 253 255 256 L 259 On the way to extending hydrogen bonding interactions between inhibitor and HIV-1 protease, pyrimidine bases were recognized as suitable as P2 ligands capable of enhancing the activity of the inhibitors. In Wang’s work [ 75 264 Scheme 50 N 50 262 N 263 Atazanavir is one of the most prescribed HIV-1 protease inhibitors approved by the FDA. It was the first protease inhibitor approved for once-a-day dosing to treat AIDS, owing to its good oral bioavailability and favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Reddy’s work [ 76 tert 268 Scheme 51 264 265 266 267 tert 4 268 Several naturally occurring triterpenes and their semisynthetic analogs have demonstrated potent anti-HIV activities. Recently, Zheng [ 77 β GA Scheme 52 270 50 GA 269 270 Certain thiazolyl and benzothiazolyl guanidines have been reported as exhibiting a wide range of pharmacological and antimicrobial activities. In the field of carbohydrates, glycosyl isothiocyanates are versatile synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of biologically active carbohydrate derivatives. Cao et al. synthesized and evaluated the bioactivity of some new N N Scheme 53 78 271 2 274 275 50 While ritonavir is approved as an HIV PI, it is hardly used as such, being more frequently used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Unfortunately, its use is often associated with various side effects. Therefore, novel derivatives have been described. Jonckers [ 79 S R N 281 Scheme 54 279 276 bis 277 278 279 280 281 50 50 Multiple heteroaromatic fragments were introduced into novel inhibitors.

Seven novel PIs were synthesized, and the modifications involved an exchange of sulfur for oxygen, a scission of a single bond in P2′-cyclopropylaminobenzothiazole (or -oxazole), and/or introduction of P1-benzene ring with mono- or bis Scheme 59 82 WT DRV P51 83 More recently, Ghosh et al.

Thus, in 2017, new heteroaryl HIV protease inhibitors, bearing a carboxy–amide spacer, were synthesized in our lab in a few steps and with high yield, starting from commercially available homochiral epoxides [ 91 A Scheme 67 i 2 2 343 344 The synthesis of benzyl derivatives 347 Scheme 68 N 345 i 2 N 3 346 N N 347 In general, the presence of a carboxyamide moiety showed a positive effect on in vitro inhibition activity against recombinant protease. The IC 50 344a 347a 50 The study of new heteroaryl HIV protease inhibitors was extended to those bearing a carbamoyl spacer [ 92 B Scheme 69 core Both the carbamoyl moiety and benzyl group displayed a general beneficial effect on the in vitro inhibition activity against recombinant protease. The IC 50 351a 351c 50 50 349b 93 Considering the structure of HIV protease as a C2-symmetric homodimer in its active form, we recently reported on the synthesis, enzyme inhibition, and structure–activity relationship of a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors containing a pseudo-symmetric hydroxyethylamine core and heteroarylcarboxyamide moieties [ 94 C Scheme 70 353a c Scheme 70 Recently, considering all our data on heteroaryl non-peptidic inhibitors, specifically their high HIV protease inhibitory activity and easy of synthetic approach, we reported novel simple heteroaryl carboxamides ( Scheme 71 p 2 p 95 Benzofuryl-, benzothienyl-, and indolyl rings were introduced via efficient synthetic procedures. All compounds showed inhibitory activity comparable to the commercial drug darunavir, with particularly potent examples such as 356a 356b 355b 50 355b 3. Conclusions In conclusion, the introduction of heterocyclic moieties into HIV protease inhibitor scaffolds remains a powerful tool to enhance their activity and overcome enzyme mutations. Both non-aromatic heterocycles, owing to their rigid structures, and heteroaromatics, due to their planar structures combined with modulation of hydrogen bonding interactions, can expand the pool of inhibitors by following the concept of targeting the protein backbone. Although much has been described regarding the interaction between heterocyclic fragments and the enzyme, the field remains open to further investigations, particularly concerning heterocycles with multiple heteroatoms (aromatic and non-aromatic) and simplified structures that reduce synthetic costs.
