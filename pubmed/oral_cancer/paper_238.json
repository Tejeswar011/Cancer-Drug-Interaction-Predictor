However, the relationship between ACEs and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) has not been thoroughly explored in adult populations. This study aimed to assess the association between ACE exposure and OHRQoL in a population-based sample of adults. Methods The study sample was drawn from the fourth Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT4) in Norway and included 6156 adults who answered questions on ACEs and OHRQoL, assessed using the validated 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). Six types of ACEs were evaluated: sexual, physical, and psychological abuse, bully victimization, parental divorce, and parental death. The relationship between ACE exposure and OHIP-14 was estimated using negative binomial regression models, adjusting for potential confounders, and presented as a ratio of means (RM) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results A total of 36.6% of participants reported experiencing at least one ACE. Those exposed to any ACE had worse OHRQoL, with higher mean OHIP-14 scores than those without ACE (3.46 vs. 2.28, p Conclusions The findings suggest that exposure to ACEs is linked with poorer OHRQoL in adulthood. These results emphasize the long-lasting association of childhood adversity with oral health and highlight the importance of considering ACEs in the prevention and management of oral health issues among vulnerable populations.

A recent study on child maltreatment in Australia found that 32.0% of respondents reported physical abuse, 28.5% reported sexual abuse, 30.9% reported emotional abuse, 8.9% reported neglect, and 39.6% reported exposure to domestic violence [ 8 3 9 It is well established that childhood adversity is associated with chronic health conditions in adulthood, as well as health-damaging behaviors [ 10 11 1 An association has also been reported between exposure to ACEs and oral health. In adolescents, those exposed to ACEs have an increased likelihood of dental fear and anxiety, irregular toothbrushing, avoidance of dental care, and having unmet treatment needs, resulting in poor oral health habits that may persist into adulthood [ 12 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 The present study focuses on the overarching concept that ACE is linked to later-in-life health issues, including oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). OHRQoL is a concept that incorporates a subjective assessment of perceived physical, psychological, and social dimensions of oral health [ 22 23 24 25 27 Previous studies on adults with a history of ACEs have used proxy measures for OHRQoL, such as the number of extracted teeth or restorations [ 16 17 28 29 Methods Study population This cross-sectional study is based on data collected in the fourth Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT4). HUNT is a population-based cohort study focusing on the adult population in Trøndelag County, Norway. All residents aged 20 years and older were invited to participate in four consecutive surveys approximately every ten years. Data collection in HUNT4 took place from 2017 to 2019, with 56 042 (54.0%) individuals agreeing to participate [ 30 n n The HUNT4 Survey was approved by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardians and the present study was approved by the Norwegian Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (97505/REK sør-øst). All variables used in this study are collected from HUNT4 questionnaires. The variables are available through HUNT Research Center that provides a detailed overview of all HUNT variables accessible at The HUNT Databank website [ 30 31 Oral health-related quality of life assessment To evaluate oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), we used a Norwegian version of the 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) [ 27 31 29 The OHIP-14 items are designed to evaluate key subdimensions of oral health impact. We used the four-dimension format: oral function, orofacial pain, orofacial appearance, and psychosocial impact, which is recommended by international consensus [ 24 23 Adverse childhood experiences The present study included six specific types of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) assessed with the following questions: sexual abuse: “Have you been subjected to unwanted sexual acts?”, physical abuse: “Have you been subjected to physical violence (beaten/injured)?”, psychological abuse: “Have you experienced repeated mental violence from someone close to you (threatened/vilified/ridiculed/demeaned)?”, bully victimization: “Have you been bullied or harassed at school or another educational institution?”, parental divorce or separation: “Did your parents get divorced or separated when you were a child?”, and death of a parent(s): “Did either of your parents die when you were a child?”. For each of the six questions, responses of “yes, before 18 years of age” were recorded as an ACE. In this study, “any ACE” was defined as having experienced one or more ACEs. All ACEs included in the present study resemble ACE categories that have been assessed in previous ACE studies [ 1 32 33 31 31 Covariates Covariates included age, sex (female; male), socioeconomic factors, living conditions, lifestyle factors, and measures of anxiety and depression collected from HUNT4 questionnaires [ 31 Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [ 34 35 Statistical analysis STATA/MP Version 18.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) was used for all statistical analyses. A two-sample t-test and Pearson chi-square test were used to assess differences in characteristics between groups. OHIP-14 total scores were presented as mean values with standard deviation (SD) and interquartile range (IQR) and differences between groups assessed with the two-sample Wilcoxon test. Associations between ACEs and oral health-related quality of life were estimated using negative binomial models, which handle overdispersion in the dependent OHIP-14 count variable. The negative binomial model presented a good fit when compared to alternative count models using the countfit 36 S1 37 Results A total of 6156 HUNT4 participants responded to questions regarding ACEs and OHIP-14.

In this population-based study of 6156 adults, 36.6% reported experiencing one or more ACEs, including parental divorce and bullying. Bully victimization was the most common ACE reported, and overall, younger individuals tended to report ACEs more frequently. Using the OHIP-14 instrument, exposure to ACEs was associated with impaired OHRQoL in the overall score and all four subdimensions: oral function, orofacial pain, orofacial appearance, and psychosocial impact. Exposure to ACEs is common; in this study, 36.6% of participants reported experiencing at least one childhood adversity. This rate is comparable to a study conducted in England, which found a prevalence of 41.9% [ 16 18 8 38 39 6 In assessing exposure to ACEs across three different age groups, we found that individuals younger than 40 years more frequently reported exposure to any one of the ACE types, except for parental death, compared to older age groups. The youngest group particularly reported experiences of parental divorce and bully victimization, along with exposure to multiple forms of ACEs. This finding aligns with Mathews et al. (2023), who reported the highest prevalence of ACEs in individuals younger than 34 years. Several reasons may account for this: first, recall bias, older individuals may tend to downplay or overlook adverse childhood events. Also, younger age groups may have greater awareness of what qualifies as an ACE, making them more likely to report such experiences [ 8 The OHIP-14 instrument is widely utilized for assessing OHRQoL, and the four subdimensions represent attributes that include generic dental patient-reported outcome measures [ 24 40 41 42 43 In the present study, the mean OHIP-14 total score was 2.71 (SD 4.92, IQR 0–3), which is lower in our sample compared to a Norwegian study conducted in 2011, where the mean OHIP-14 total score was 4.1 [ 27 44 45 In this study, adults reporting ACEs exhibited impaired OHRQoL compared to those not exposed. This was reflected in the OHIP-14 total score and all four subdimensions: oral function, orofacial pain, orofacial appearance, and psychosocial impact. We also found that all the specific ACEs, except for the death of a parent, were associated with impaired OHRQoL. We further adjusted for depression and anxiety, which decreased the magnitude of the associations, and we found no association for parental divorce or the death of a parent in this model. Mental disorders may be considered part of the mechanism through which ACEs are linked to impaired oral health-related quality of life. ACEs may disrupt emotional development, increasing vulnerability to depression and anxiety disorders [ 46 47 48 While no other studies have assessed the link between ACEs and OHRQoL in adult populations, research has shown that experiencing any form of childhood abuse was associated with having fewer remaining teeth [ 28 17 18 49 We observed a dose-response relationship between reported adversities and the OHIP-14 total score, indicating a 21% increase in mean OHIP-14 score for one additional ACE exposure. Our findings align with the cumulative risk model, which suggests that the number of exposures to any risk factor determines its impact, irrespective of the intensity or type of the factor [ 50 17 Exposure to ACE also results in significant and sustained losses in health-related quality of life. Translated into QALYs (quality-adjusted life years, i.e., years with good health), those exposed to ACE had a decrease of at least two years of quality-adjusted life expectancy compared to those with no ACE history [ 51 47 Major strengths include that the sample for the present study was based on a general population survey, HUNT4, inviting all adult residents of Trøndelag County, Norway. Our study sample of 6156 individuals was derived from a random selection of the 56 042 HUNT4 participants and generally exhibited similar characteristics compared to the larger sample of HUNT4 and to those excluded due to missing answers, as shown in Supplementary Table S4.1 One limitation of this study is the retrospective collection of data on ACEs. The older the respondent, the lower the reported prevalence of exposure. This may partly be explained by recall bias and differences in culture and attitudes about what constitutes abuse [ 52 1 Conclusions This study provides evidence of an association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and a poorer oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in adulthood. Individuals who experienced ACEs reported greater impairment across all four subdimensions of OHRQoL. A dose-response relationship was observed, with the severity of oral health impairment increasing as the number of ACEs rose. The results further underscore the importance of dental professionals developing an understanding of the connections between ACEs and poor oral health outcomes in adulthood. This includes skills to inquire about and recognize potential signs, respond with sensitivity and appropriate referrals, and tailor treatment approaches to address the unique psychological and physiological needs of individuals who have experienced abuse.
