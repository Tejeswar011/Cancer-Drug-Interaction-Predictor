Highlights • A single intraperitoneal dose of the hP2X4R scFv reversed mechanical hypersensitivity in male mice suffering from chronic neuropathic pain. • hP2X4R scFv altered excitability of spinal dorsal horn and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray Fos+ neurons involved in chronic pain. • hP2X4R scFv decreased the excitability of large diameter DRG and TG neurons from neuropathic mice, but had no effect on neurons from naïve mice. • This study supports hP2X4R scFv as a promising non-opioid biologic for chronic pain treatment. Neuropathic pain remains a challenging clinical condition due to its resistance to conventional analgesics. The purinergic P2X4 receptor (P2X4R), an ATP-gated ion channel, is upregulated in sensory neurons and glial cells following nerve injury and is pivotal in chronic pain pathogenesis. This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of a novel humanized single-chain variable fragment antibody (hP2X4R scFv) targeting P2X4R in male mice models of neuropathic pain. Using spared nerve injury (SNI) and foramen rotundum inflammatory compression of the trigeminal infraorbital nerve (FRICT-ION) models, we demonstrate that a single intraperitoneal dose of hP2X4R scFv significantly reverses mechanical hypersensitivity for up to four weeks. Electrophysiological recordings from FosTRAP mice revealed that hP2X4R scFv reduced the excitability of Fos+ neurons in the spinal dorsal horn and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), key regions involved in pain processing.

We evaluated its effects on neuronal excitability in vitro ex vivo ex vivo Heinricher et al., 2009 Alles and Smith, 2018 in vitro 2 Methods 2.1 Animals All animal research was conducted with the approval of the University of New Mexico Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Our facilities are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) and hold all necessary federal certifications: Animal Welfare Assurance #D16-00,228 (A3350-01) and USDA Registration # 85-R-0014. All rodents were housed in a well-ventilated room maintained at 20–22 °C, with a reversed 10/14  h dark/light cycle to facilitate testing during their active phase. They were acclimated for one week prior to commencing the studies. They had unrestricted access to food and water throughout the experimental period, receiving a standard chow diet with low soybean content. Male BALB/cAnNHsd mice (5–6 weeks old; Jackson Laboratories) and male FosTRAP (Fos2iCreERT2/J crossed with B6-Tg Ai14tdTOMfl mice (also 5–6 weeks old) underwent surgical procedures to induce models of neuropathic pain models, specifically SNI and foramen rotundum inflammatory compression of the trigeminal infraorbital nerve (FRICT-ION). All surgeries were conducted under sterile conditions using a surgical microscope, and mice were anesthetized with 2 to 5 % isoflurane. 2.2 Generation of humanized scFv The humanized P2X4 heavy-chain single variable fragment (hP2X4 scFv) was generated as described and characterized previously ( Kunamneni and Westlund, 2025 Zurek et al., 2025 Westlund et al., 2021b High and Kunamneni, 2025 2.3 Surgical induction of the neuropathic pain models 2.3.1 Spared nerve injury model Male BALB/cAnNHsd mice aged 5–6 weeks (obtained from Jackson Laboratories) and male Fos2iCreERT2/J x B6-Tg Ai14tdTOMfl mice of the same age were used to establish the SNI model of neuropathic pain ( Decosterd and Woolf, 2000 Chaplan et al., 1994 2.3.2 Trigeminal neuropathic pain model Male BALB/cAnNHsd mice (aged 5–6 weeks; from Jackson Laboratories) and male Fos2iCreERT2/J x B6-Tg Ai14tdTOMfl mice of the same age were tested in a FRICT-ION-induced neuropathic pain model. The acronym FRICT-ION refers to a chronic model that causes compression and chemical irritation of the trigeminal nerve. Our lab established the FRICT-ION trigeminal neuropathic pain model by introducing 3 mm of chromic catgut suture (4-0) through a tiny scalpel incision in the oral buccal/cheek crease along the trigeminal maxillary nerve branch (V2) as it enters the foramen rotundum of the skull ( Montera and Westlund, 2020 Montera and Westlund, 2020 Mechanical sensitivity on the left hind paw (SNI) and snout (FRICT-ION) was assessed prior to nerve injury to establish baseline thresholds and weekly after nerve injury using the “up and down” von Frey approach ( Chaplan et al., 1994 Goins et al., 2022 Montera and Westlund, 2020 2.5 Preparation of ex vivo spinal cord slices from FosTRAP mice Male Fos2iCreERT2/J x B6-Tg Ai14tdTOMfl SNI FosTRAP mice (TRAP2) ( DeNardo et al., 2019 Corder et al.

The bilateral L3-L5 DRGs were carefully removed and placed in ice-cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without Ca 2 + 2 + Subsequently, the ganglia were digested for 20 min in an enzymatic solution composed of HBSS, papain (1 mg protein/mL, Worthington, Cat# LS003126 LS004176 2+ 2 + Malin et al., 2007 2 2.7.2 Trigeminal ganglion culture Male BALB/cAnNHsd FRICT-ION mice were deeply anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and then euthanized by decapitation prior dissecting the trigeminal ganglia (TG) for primary cultures intended for electrophysiological studies. The skull was opened, and the brain was extracted to reveal the TG. The TG were carefully extracted from the connective tissue and dura mater at the cranium's base. The ganglia were put in a 5 cm culture dish containing ice-cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution without Ca 2+ 2+ LS003126 g LS004176 g Westlund et al., 2021a 2 2.8 Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology was performed as previously described ( Goins et al., 2022 Ehsanian et al., 2021 Zurek et al., 2024 Zurek et al., 2024 Goyal et al., 2025 2 2 2.9 Electrophysiology analysis methods Current clamp recordings began with 25 ms (ms) of the cell at rest, followed by a 500 ms current pulse that increased in 10pA increments from −100 pA in increments until reaching inactivation, or a maximum of 4nA. There was a 500 ms recovery between each current clamp step. Electrophysiological analysis was conducted using Easy Electrophysiology, as previously described ( Zurek et al., 2024 Zurek et al., 2024 Goyal et al., 2025 RMP was calculated as an average of at least 10 sweeps and was not corrected for junction potential. The hyperpolarizing −100 pA step was used to determine input resistance (Rin). Cells that fired more than one AP during any current injection at or above rheobase were classified as multi-firing. APs resulting from spontaneous activity were excluded when determining multi-firing cells. Spontaneous activity was assessed with either no current injection or enough current applied to maintain the membrane voltage at −45 mV during a 30 s recording. Neurons that generated one or more APs during the 30 s recording were classified as having spontaneous activity. Rebound firing was defined as AP firing occurring during the 500 ms recovery period following any hyperpolarizing current injections. Firing frequency plots were created considering only the multi-firing cells. The number of APs generated above rheobase was plotted and analyzed in GraphPad Prism v10.0.2 at each current level. Cell diameters were used to characterize cells by size: small cells measured less than 25 µm in diameter, while large cell diameters were 25 µm or larger. 2.10 Statistical and data analysis Electrophysiological analysis was conducted using Easy Electrophysiology v.2.5.1 (London, UK) and Clampfit 11.2 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Statistical analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism v10.0.2 (Boston, MA). Error bars denote the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless specified otherwise. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical tests are shown in the figure legends. 3 Results 3.1 Humanized hP2X4 scFv reduced pain-like behavior and excitability of lamina II spinal dorsal horn neurons from SNI FosTRAP mice Administration of a single dose of hP2X4 scFv (4 mg/kg, i.p.) restored mechanical sensitivity to naïve levels in the SNI mice ( Fig. 1a Alles and Smith, 2018 Furue et al., 2004 Basbaum, 1999 ex vivo Fig. 1 Humanized P2X4 scFv reversed pain like behavior and reduced excitability of lamina II spinal dorsal horn neurons from SNI FosTRAP mice. (a) A single dose of hP2X4 scFv given 3 weeks after induction of SNI model reverses mechanical hypersensitivity in ipsilateral hind paw to von Frey stimulation in mice through to the end of the seven-week study time course (n = 4 mice per group, p < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). (b) Photo of laminae II, spinal cord slice with patch pipette (dotted lines indicate lamina II) and Fos+ neuron (circled with blue dotted line). Electrophysiology recordings of laminae II Fos+ substantia-gelatinosa neurons in ex-vivo Current clamp recordings were obtained from L4-L6 spinal cord lamina II Fos+ neurons. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, we observed a significant reduction in the percentage of cells that displayed multi- firing when treated with hP2X4 scFv compared to vehicle controls 80 % vs 100 %, p < 0.0001; Fisher’s exact test) ( Fig. 1c Fig. 1d Fig. 1e Fig. 1 3.2 Humanized P2X4 scFv reduced pain-like behavior and altered excitability of ventrolateral periaqueductal neurons from FRICT-ION FosTRAP mice A single dose of hP2X4 scFv (4 mg/kg, i.p.) restored mechanical sensitivity to naïve levels in the FRICT-ION mice ( Fig. 2a Fig. 2 Humanized P2X4 scFv reversed pain-like behavior and altered excitability of ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) neurons from FRICT-ION FosTRAP mice. (a) A single dose of hP2X4 scFv given 3 weeks after induction of FRICT-ION model reverses mechanical hypersensitivity in snout to von Frey stimulation in mice through to the end of the seven-week study time course (n = 4 mice per group, p < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). (b) Photo of vlPAG, brain slice with patch pipette (dotted lines indicate vlPAG) and Fos+ vlPAG neurons (circled with blue dotted line). Electrophysiology recordings of Fos+ ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) neurons in ex-vivo brain slices from hP2X4 scFv intraperitoneal-injected FosTRAP FRICT-ION male mice (n = 4 per group). No significant effect was observed on (c) multi-firing property and (d) spontaneous activity (holding at −45 mV) following hP2X4 scFv treatment. (e) Significant difference was found in the percentage of cells that displayed rebound firing following hP2X4 scFv treatment (Vehicle treated cells n = 20 and hP2X4 scFv treated cells n = 16, p < 0.001; Fisher’s exact test) compared to vehicle control. Example traces illustrating multi/rebound firing and SA in vehicle cell. (f) Rheobase (minimum current to elicit firing) (g) resting membrane potential and (h) input resistance were not significantly changed following hP2X4 scFv treatment. (i) No significant effect was observed on action potential firing frequency (F-I) during the current step protocol (10 pA stepwise increase of 500 ms current injection window) as current injection increased from rheobase. F-I analysis is restricted to multi-firing cells, thus vehicle treated cells n = 14 and hP2X4 treated cells n = 16.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Since vlPAGs play a key role in chronic pain ( Snyder et al., 2018 ex vivo ex vivo Fig. 2 Fig. 2e Fig. 2 3.3 Humanized P2X4 scFv reduced larger-diameter DRG neuron excitability from SNI, but not naïve, mice We assessed the direct impact of hP2X4 scFv on the excitability of DRG neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology recordings. These recordings were conducted on dissociated DRG neurons that were plated 16–20 h prior. The neurons were exposed to 4.5 µg/ml hP2X4 scFv or vehicle in culture media for one hour before recording from naïve and SNI mice. Using current clamp, we recorded small (<25 µm) and large (>25 µm) diameter neurons in both naïve and SNI mice. We observed no significant changes in rheobase or RMP showed no significant changes in small and large neurons from both naïve and SNI mice after hP2X4 scFv in vitro Fig. 3A in vitro Fig. 3A Fig. 3 Humanized P2X4 scFv reduces large DRG neuron excitability obtained from SNI mice. Current clamp results from small (<25 μm) and large (>25 μm) diameter dorsal root ganglion neurons from naïve and SNI mice (8–12 weeks old male BALB/c, n = 6 each group) treated in vitro However, in SNI mice, there was a significant decrease in action potential firing frequency in large DRG neurons treated with hP2X4 scFv compared to vehicle control (n = 6 mice per group, *p < 0.05; two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test) ( Fig. 3B 3.4 Humanized P2X4 scFv reduces larger-diameter TG neuron excitability from FRICT-ION, but not naïve, mice To assess the direct impact of hP2X4 scFv on TG neuron excitability, we conducted patch-clamp recordings on cultured TG neurons 16–20 h after plating. Cells were treated with 4.5 µg/ml hP2X4 scFv/vehicle for one hour before recording from naïve and FRICT-ION mice. Current clamp recordings were performed on small (<25 µm) and large (>25 µm) diameter neurons of both naïve and FRICT-ION mice. There was no significant alteration in rheobase and RMP in either small or large diameter neurons of naïve and FRICT-ION mice after hP2X4 scFv treatment compared to vehicle control ( Fig. 4A in vitro Fig. 4A Fig. 4B Fig. 4 Humanized P2X4 scFv reduces large TG neuron excitability obtained from FRICT-ION mice. Current clamp results from small (<25 μm) and large (>25 μm) diameter TG neurons from naïve and FRICT-ION mice (8–12 weeks old male BALB/c, n = 6 each group) treated in vitro Discussion This study examined the behavioral and electrophysiological effects a single i.p. dose of hP2X4 scFv on peripheral and central neurons in male mice with SNI and FRICT-ION models of chronic pain. We confirmed that a single dose of hP2X4 scFv increases the withdrawal threshold for mechanical allodynia in FosTRAP male mice with SNI and FRICT-ION chronic pain models. Our data indicates that hP2X4 scFv reduces neuronal excitability within lamina II neurons in SNI mice by decreasing the prevalence of multi-firing and spontaneous activity. This effect correlates with an overall decrease in the excitability of large (>25 μm) DRG neurons in SNI mice. These findings suggest that hP2X4 scFv may inform the development of new therapeutic interventions for chronic pain. The SNI and FRICT-ION models produce mechanical hypersensitivity of the hind paw of SNI mice and in the snout of FRICT-ION mice ( Alles et al., 2017 Goins et al., 2022 Kunamneni et al., 2023 Westlund et al., 2021b Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Kunamneni and Westlund, 2025 Inoue, 2019 Tsuda et al., 2003 Zhang et al., 2020 In our investigation of the central effects of hP2X4 scFv, we observed a reduction in the excitability of Fos+ neurons in lamina II of the spinal dorsal horn in SNI FosTRAP mice. The spinal dorsal horn serves as a relay station for nociceptive inputs received from peripheral DRG neurons. Increased excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons is associated with neuropathic pain ( Alles and Smith, 2018 Furue et al., 2004 Basbaum, 1999 Alles et al., 2017 v Alles et al., 2020 Mapplebeck et al., 2018 The actions of hP2X4 scFv on vlPAG neurons result in an increase in the incidence of rebound firing of Fos+ neurons in the vlPAG of FRICT-ION FosTRAP mice. The vlPAG is a critical hub for processing nociceptive information, and has been strongly implicated in chronic pain states ( Heinricher et al., 2009 Montera et al., 2020 Alaklabi et al., 2023 Gambeta et al., 2022 Yu et al., 2024 V Cazade et al., 2014 Peripheral sensitization plays a crucial role in initiating neuropathic pain ( Liu et al., 2022 in vitro in vitro Viana et al., 2002 Nitzan-Luques et al., 2011 MacDonald et al., 2021 Chen et al., 2022 Khakh et al., 2001 Khakh et al., 1999 Kushnir et al., 2011 Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of hP2X4 scFv as a potential targeted non-opioid therapy for chronic pain. Most importantly, we reveal the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying reversal of chronic pain-related behavioral effects of a single dose of hP2X4 scFv.
