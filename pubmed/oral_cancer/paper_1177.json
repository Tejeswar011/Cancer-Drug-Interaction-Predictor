Introduction RNA viruses present a persistent and evolving threat to global public health. This was clearly exemplified by the recent devastating effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, causing greater than 700 million infections and 7 million deaths worldwide [ 1 2 2 While antiviral drugs provide powerful countermeasures to certain RNA viruses, there are limitations. For example, most existing antivirals exhibit narrow specificity, targeting only a limited range of viral strains or families [ 3 4 Chalcones are common precursors to flavones and flavonoid structures and have diverse biological effects [ 5 5 6 7 Figure 1 5 Chalcones have also served as antiviral agents [ 7 10 8o 7 10 Here, we tested the antiviral potential of chalcones against prototypic members of four diverse RNA virus families, with some members of each virus family being identified as potential candidates for new emerging pathogens. Briefly described, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) is a prototype member of the paramyxovirus family of viruses, some of which are important animal and human pathogens, such as mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Nipah virus [ 11 12 13 Flaviviridae 14 In search of general treatments for single-stranded RNA viruses, we investigated the antiviral activity of chalcones against PIV5, LACV, [ 15 8o 7 10 Figure 1 7 10 In this report, we show that chalcone treatment reduced the spread of PIV5 in fibroblast cell cultures when added to cultures as late as 24 h post-infection. The addition of select chalcones to cell cultures of PIV5-infected human fibroblasts resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of PIV5 replication. Most importantly, we also demonstrate the inhibitory effects of chalcones in fibroblast cell cultures of the Bunyavirus La Crosse Virus (LACV, a negative sense single stranded RNA virus), as well as two other positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses: the Coronavirus OC43 and the Flavivirus Zika Virus (ZIKV). These findings indicate the potential for broad spectrum anti-viral activity via specific chalcone designs. Collectively, these data provide a strong rationale for the further development of chalcone derivatives as potent, broad-spectrum antiviral treatments against diverse families of RNA viruses. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cells Lines Cultures of CHO-K1 (ATCC, catalog #CCL-61, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 2 2 2.2. Viruses and Infections Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) was derived from cDNA, grown at 37 °C in Madin–Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells and titered on CV-1 (African green monkey kidney) cells with a fibroblast morphology as previously described [ 16 La Crosse Virus (LACV) was kindly provided by Andrew Pekosz (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA), grown at 28 °C in C6/36 cells derived from the larvae of the Asian tiger mosquito (ATCC), and titered at 37 °C on Vero cells as previously described [ 17 The MR766 strain of Zika Virus (ZIKV) (ATCC-VR84, Manassas, VA, USA) was grown and titered at 37 °C using Vero cells as previously described [ 18 Human Coronavirus OC43 (ATCC, catalog number VR-1558) was grown in a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HCT-8; ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, catalog #CCL-244) at 33 °C as previously described [ 19 50 19 The starting titers of stocks of PIV5, OC43, ZIKV, and LACV were 5.6 × 10 7 7 50 6 7 2.3. Chalcone Treatments Chalcone treatments were performed in DMEM supplemented with 10% HI FBS at the indicated concentrations and for indicated periods of time. Chalcone stocks were reconstituted in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 10 mM and were serially diluted to working concentrations in DMSO. DMSO control treatments to test the effect of the vehicle were performed at volumes corresponding to the volume of chalcone added during each experiment (i.e., 1 µL chalcone DMSO solution/1 mL DMEM [10 µM] utilized alongside the DMSO control of 1 µL/1 mL DMEM). For cytotoxicity assays, untreated controls were subtracted from DMSO and chalcone sample values to account for the background signal. 2.4. Flow Cytometry For cytotoxicity assays, cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) at a dilution of 1:100. Cell viability was determined via flow cytometry using the CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). CytExpert software (Beckman Coulter, version 2.4) was used to analyze independent events. PIV5 infection was monitored using flow cytometry via the FITC channel by analyzing GFP expression of individual cells. ZIKV infection was monitored utilizing Flavivirus group antigen–antibody (D1-4G2-4-15; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) staining for the ZIKV envelope protein. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using eBioscience Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilization Buffer (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Secondary staining was performed using an anti-Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) antibody (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). OC43 infection was monitored utilizing a primary antibody targeted toward the OC43 nucleocapsid protein (NP, MAB9013, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary staining was performed using an AF488 antibody. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as previously described. LACV infection was monitored utilizing an anti-LACV Gc 807.31ab antibody kindly provided by Andrew Pekosv. Secondary staining was performed using an AF488 antibody. Cells were fixed and permeabilized as previously described [ 19 2.5. RT-qPCR Hs27 cells cultured in 6-well dishes were collected in TRIzol ® ® ® Table 1 2.6. Western Blotting Hs27 (human skin fibroblast) cells cultured in 6-well dishes were lysed using protein lysis buffer. Cell lysates were resolved on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After normalizing samples via western blotting for β-actin (1:20,000 dilution, catalog number A5316, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), samples were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies for the PIV5 NP (1:2000) and P proteins (1:2000) [ 20 PANC-1 cells were cultured in 6-well dishes and were lysed using modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) containing a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lysates with 25 µg of protein were resolved on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The samples were probed with rabbit monoclonal antibodies for the P-rps6 (1:1000) protein (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) and mouse monoclonal antibodies for rps6 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling) and β-actin (1:5000) (Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA) proteins. Blots were visualized using anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (Cell Signaling) and chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 2.7. Growth Inhibition Assay A cell growth assay using the MTS reagent was conducted to assess the general toxicity of each chalcone compound. Briefly, cell growth was assayed in sterile 96-well microtiter plates (Costar 3599, Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) in the presence of each chalcone. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. In a typical experiment, there are two plates. The first is the control plate, which allows one to assess the starting cell population on the day of drug addition (Day 0). The second plate is the test plate where cells are plated and tested with different drug concentrations on Day 0. For example, either CHO cells or Hs27 cells were plated in a 200 µL volume at 1000 cells/well on both the control and test plates and incubated overnight to allow the cells to adhere. On Day 0, 1 μL of PBS was added to the control plate wells so that their total volume was 201 μL. MTS reagent (Promega Cell Titer 96 Aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation reagent, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added (20 μL) to each well on the control plate, and that plate was incubated for 4 h in a 5% CO 2 On Day 0, 1 μL of a 200× stock solution of each chalcone was added to the respected well on the test plate, and each condition was tested in triplicate. Drug solutions were prepared in advance in 100% DMSO and dosed so that the final DMSO concentration was 0.5%. For example, 1 μL of chalcone solution was added to the cells plated in each well in 200 μL of media. Of note, the respective chalcone addition occurred after an initial overnight incubation of each cell line in each well to reach Day 0 (the drugging day). After the chalcone was added, the cells were incubated in 5% CO 2 50 Table 2 For highly colored materials like the chalcones, it is important to consider the contribution of the compound’s own absorbance to the MTS assay. To correct for the absorbance contribution of the chalcone itself, we measured each chalcone’s absorbance (Chalcone Abs) at 490 nm at the respective concentration (e.g., 10 µM) and subtracted the absorbance of the media background (blank Abs). This net value was then subtracted out of the Day 2 absorbance value to provide the % relative growth via the following equation: (1) %  R e l a t i v e  G r o w t h  =  ( D a y  2  A b s − D a y  2  b l a n k  A b s ) − C h a l c o n e  A b s − b l a n k  A b s − ( D a y  0  A b s − D a y  0  b l a n k  A b s ) ( D a y  2  C o n t r o l  A b s  − D a y  2  b l a n k  A b s ) − ( D a y  0  A b s − D a y  0  b l a n k  A b s )  × 100 % 2.8.

Results 3.1. Synthesis As shown in Figure 2 wt v Specific chalcones were synthesized to expand upon the earlier chalcone library as shown in Figure 3 1 4 5 O 7a 7d 8a 8f 8l 8o 8p 8q 8z Figure 3 7 10 8v 8w 2 1 13 With the chalcones in hand, we then evaluated their growth-inhibition properties in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and human Hs27 fibroblast cells. These studies provided insight into the maximum tolerated concentration of each chalcone before affecting growth by determining the EC 10 2 50 2 Table 2 As shown in Table 2 10 50 8a 50 8p 8v 50 50 50 8f 50 Table 2 50 3.2. Comparison of Cytotoxicity and Anti-Viral Effect of Chalcones 8a 8f 8l 8o 8p 8q 8z To measure the effect of chalcone treatment on PIV5 virus growth, Hs27 cells were infected with PIV5-GFP. This engineered negative sense single-stranded RNA virus expresses GFP, which serves as a genome-encoded protein readout. After entering a cell, PIV5 must first undergo primary transcription to convert its genome into mRNA. As genome replication begins, nascent genomes then become templates for further conversion to mRNA and viral gene expression becomes amplified in a process called secondary transcription. For viral proteins to be detectable in cell culture, this amplification must first take place, making the expression of GFP a direct indicator of whether secondary transcription has successfully occurred [ 24 Figure 4 8o Figure 4 8f 8l 8o 8p 8s 8w 8x 8z To determine the actual cytotoxic effects of select chalcones in the series, human fibroblast Hs27 cells were treated with DMSO as a control or treated with each selected chalcone at a concentration of 10 µM. At 24 h post-treatment (hpt), the Hs27 cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI), a stain for cells with permeable plasma membranes, and then processed for flow cytometry (see Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 8o 8p 8w 8f 8l 8s 8x 8z 8f 8l 8o 8p 8s 8w 8x 8z Table 2 8l 1 8o 1 1 3.3.

Chalcone Antiviral Effects Occur at an Early Stage of the PIV5-GFP Replication Cycle To determine how the time of addition of chalcones affected their ability to inhibit viral protein expression, Hs27 cells were treated with 10 μM of each chalcone overnight, mock infected or infected with PIV5-GFP at a high MOI, and then incubated in media lacking chalcone. At 24 hpi, cells were analyzed for GFP expression using flow cytometry (experimental design shown in Figure 6 Figure 6 8a 8o 8p A time-of-addition experiment was then carried out to determine the time post-infection at which the chalcones inhibited viral protein expression. Hs27 cells were mock infected or infected with PIV5-GFP at a high MOI. Chalcones were then added at 10 μM to cell cultures at 0, 6, or 18 hpi. At 42 hpi, GFP expression was quantified using flow cytometry (see the design shown in Figure 6 Figure 6 8a 8o 8p 8o 8p 3.5. Chalcones Inhibit Spread of PIV5-GFP Through a Population of Fibroblast Cells The above experiments were all performed at a high MOI in which the infection is synchronized across the cell population. To determine whether chalcones could reduce virus spread through a population of naïve cells, Hs27 cells were mock infected or infected with PIV5-GFP at a low MOI. Chalcones were then added to cell cultures at a concentration of 10 μM at 0, 24, 48, or 72 hpi, and GFP expression was quantified via flow cytometry at 96 hpi. As shown in Figure 7 8a Figure 7 8o 8p Figure 7 8o 8p 3.6. Chalcones Inhibit Expression of PIV5-GFP Genes and Proteins in Infected Fibroblasts To better understand how the chalcones were inhibiting virus growth, RT-qPCR was utilized to determine the effect of chalcone treatment on viral gene expression. Hs27 cells were treated with DMSO as a control or treated with 8o 8o As shown in Figure 8 8o 8o 8o 8o The above experiments utilized GFP expression and flow cytometry as an assay for observing the effects of chalcones on viral protein expression.

Discussion The most striking finding from our virology studies was the broad-spectrum antiviral effects that our chalcones showed on prototype members of four different virus families, each of which is considered a prime candidate family for an emerging pandemic virus: Paramyxo-, Bunya-, Flavi-, and Corona-viruses. This broad inhibition of multiple divergent virus families is the major discovery of this report. The observed pan anti-viral activities of 8o 8p We speculate that the chalcone-mediated inhibition of viral entry is not likely because all four viruses tested here bind to different cellular receptors to initiate the infection: sialic acid for PIV5, DC-SIGN for LACV, AXL for ZIKV, and TMPRSS2 for OC43 [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 A common feature of these four viruses is that they are completely dependent on the production of a viral RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RDRP) from incoming genomes. Thus, a common mechanism of action of our chalcones may include inhibition of the viral RDRP. Our initial studies focused on the effect of chalcones on the replication of PIV5, a prototype member of the Paramyxovirus 24 Recent reports have suggested that chalcones can bind to the RDRP of SARS-CoV2, for example [ 33 34 35 Another possible mechanism of action of our chalcones could be independent of the viral machinery. We speculate that host cells with inhibited growth are poor viral hosts. In one scenario, chalcone disruption of host cell growth and proliferation pathways may create unfavorable intracellular environments for viral replication. Some reports suggest that chalcones can induce cell cycle arrest [ 36 8o Figure 12 We note that compound 8o 37 38 8o 38 Our work represents an important contribution to this evolving research area by suggesting chalcones as a core scaffold for broad spectrum antivirals [ 39 40 pro pro 39 40 41 5. Conclusions In closing, RNA viruses continue to pose a threat to global human health. In the absence of an effective vaccine, research into novel antiviral compounds is warranted due to drug resistance and a lack of broad-spectrum antivirals. Our preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that chalcones like 8o 6. Patents Phanstiel IV, O., Tschammer, N. Flavonoid based antiviral targets. US Patent 9629822, issued on 25 April 2017.
