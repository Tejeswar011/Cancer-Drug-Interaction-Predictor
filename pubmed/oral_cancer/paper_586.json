Methods: Data were collected in major Palestinian hospitals via a questionnaire that explored participants’ satisfaction with the information provided and the quality of communication by referring physicians. Results: The final sample consisted of 282 caregivers. Most caregivers demonstrated high satisfaction with the adequacy of information regarding the indication for radiological testing (92.2%), but they were not satisfied with the information about radiation dose (56.8%). The majority were satisfied with the mutual discussions (90.8%), previous radiological tests (62.6%), and radiological information about the indicated examination (76.2%). Conclusions: The quality of communication was inadequate. While most caregivers preferred receiving verbal and written information from providers, some preferred other sources of information, such as digital media. Interventions should use educational courses and develop policies to address communication problems regarding radiological safety. radiology radiation risks radiological safety X-ray CT scan radiologists communication medical information pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes cover-date January-December 2025 typesetter ts1 Introduction Communication in clinical practice is central to the delivery of health services. Effective communication is premised on having strong communication skills and the ability to establish good interpersonal relationships to facilitate information exchange and shared decision-making. 1 4  5  6 6 8 9 10  11 Effective information exchange in radiological care in particular is of the utmost importance because radiological care is associated with additional safety concerns. Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to a deterministic response manifested as tissue damage and a stochastic response manifested as genetic mutations and cancer. Dose-dependent tissue damage occurs when the amount of radiation exceeds a threshold dose,  12  13  14  15  16 12 17  18 However, communicating about radiological safety is challenging for several reasons. First, explaining the mechanisms and pathophysiology implicated in radiation exposure is complicated, as it includes complex concepts, such as radiation dose. Second, risk-benefit dialogue can be influenced by overestimation of the risks. The risks of indicated radiological exams should be communicated in the context of benefits that almost always outweigh anticipated risks if the test is clinically indicated.  19 20 21 22 23 24 25 The method of communicating about radiological examinations of children involves the healthcare professional, the caregiver, and the child. Radiographers’ communication with competent children has been described as paternalistic and instructional, neglecting the child’s concerns, needs, and emotions and further placing the child as a passive consumer of health services. 26 28 29 30 24 31 Methods Study Design and Settings This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study conducted between August 2023 and October 2023. It was carried out at the radiology departments of four major hospitals in the West Bank: Rafidia Governmental Hospital, An Najah National University Hospital, Palestine Medical Complex, and Beit Jala Governmental Hospital. Population and Sampling According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), a total of 1,346,888 children were residents of the West Bank in 2023.  32 Raosoft  33 Data Collection The caregivers were approached and invited to participate in the research after signing a written consent, providing answers via a self-administered questionnaire with the help of the research team when necessary. This questionnaire was developed through a literature review of similar studies 26 32 35 The questionnaire consists of 3 sections. The first included questions on the background characteristics of the children participating in the study. The background characteristics included demographic and personal information on age (categorized into levels: 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, and 13-18 years); gender; area of residence (urban, rural, and refugee camp); relationship with caregiver (mother, father, brother, sister, and other); age of caregiver (as a continuous variable in years); and paternal and maternal educational level (did not receive formal education, primary, secondary, undergraduate, or postgraduate education). This part also included clinical questions on the type of imaging test (X-ray, CT scan, and sonogram); the targeted body location for imaging (head; long bone; non-long bone; chest, shoulder, and abdomen; pelvis; and miscellaneous location); and the number of previous exposures to medical radiation (continuous variable). The second part consisted of three sections that explored caregiver satisfaction with the communication with the referring physician. First, satisfaction with the overall quality of information and communication that caregivers had received was rated on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 indicates complete dissatisfaction and 10 indicates complete satisfaction. The second section used a 5-point Likert scale to ask participants to rate their satisfaction with the adequacy of the information across 3 domains: the indication for the radiological exam, radiation dose, and alternative tests. The third section used the same Likert scale design to rate satisfaction with the mutual discussion that caregivers had with the referring physicians regarding 3 issues: the clinical presentation of the child; information about the radiological test (the indication for, the radiation dose of, and alternative diagnostic options to the requested radiological test); and the previous radiological tests that the child had undergone. The Likert scale adopted a 5-point design whose possible answers ranged from fully dissatisfied to fully satisfied, with a “neutral” option. The third part of the questionnaire investigated the future preferences of caregivers. A design of multiple choice questions was used to explore the preferred method of communication (verbal, written, or both); preferred source of information in addition to the healthcare professional (healthcare professionals only; digital media, including the internet and social media; traditional media, including TV and radio; both digital and traditional media); healthcare professional (radiologist, referring physician, or others); and type of information (type of radiation exam, consequences of radiation, the indication and rationale for radiation exposure). Data Analysis The data were coded, inserted, and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM-SPSS) version 21. Only descriptive statistics were used to calculate the frequencies and percentages for categorical and ordinal variables and the means and standard deviations for continuous variables. The figures were used for better clarification of the items on a Likert scale. Ethical Approval and Informed Consent The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of An-Najah National University in Nablus (Reference number: (27) September 2019). It was reviewed by hospital and department officials. The purpose of the study and interview content were described to the participants, and written informed consent was obtained before starting the interview to confirm that participation was decided voluntarily. The collected data were kept confidential and were used only for research purposes. Results Of the 400 caregivers approached, 60 declined to participate (15%), and 58 were excluded based on the exclusion criteria (14.5%). The final sample comprised 282 caregivers of 282 children. The mean age of the children was 9.1 years (SD ± 5.6) (62.7%), and 173 (61.3%) were males and 109 (38.7%) were females. The majority of the participants resided in cities (59.6%), and more than a third resided in rural areas (35.5%). The mean age of the caregivers was 37.17 years (SD ± 10.17), 56.7% were mothers, 29.4% were fathers, 5% were sisters, and 4.3% were brothers to the child. Most of the fathers had an undergraduate education (61.7%), and nearly one-fifth had secondary education (20.9%). Maternal education level demonstrated a similar trend, as most participating mothers had an undergraduate-level education (66.0%), and 24.5% had a secondary-level education. Approximately two-thirds of the children underwent X-ray imaging (66.3%), 25.2% underwent CT, and only 8.5% underwent sonography. The chest, shoulder, and abdomen were the most common body locations targeted for imaging (33.7%), followed by miscellaneous locations (18.4%), small bones (16.3%), and long bones (16.0%) ( Table 1 Table 1.

The vast majority of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied (92.2%) with the information they received about the indication for the radiological exam, while most were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied (56.8%) with the information about the radiation dose. The responses regarding alternative radiological options were more divergent, with 29.4% very dissatisfied and 25.5% very satisfied (see Figure 1 Figure 1. Level of satisfaction with the adequacy of received information. This bar chart shows the percentage of patients who were satisfied with the information they received, neutral, dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied, in different categories: indication for the examination, dose of radiation, and alternative options. It can be inferred that the information provided was mostly satisfactory, but some room for improvement is apparent. The satisfaction rates varied across different categories, with the dose of radiation having the lowest satisfaction rate. The majority of patients in all categories were either very satisfied or satisfied. The alternative options category had the highest percentage of neutral responses, followed closely by satisfied. This suggests that while the information provided was acceptable, there was still room for improvement in certain areas. The alternative options category had the highest percentage of dissatisfied and very dissatisfied responses, indicating a need for better communication of the available choices to patients. Overall, the chart presents a clear breakdown of patient satisfaction levels with the information received in different aspects of the medical examination process. Most respondents were satisfied or very satisfied (90.8%) with the mutual discussion they had with the referring physician about the clinical presentation of their children. Similarly, the majority of caregivers were satisfied or very satisfied with the mutual discussion they had regarding the indication for and radiation dose and alternative options of the radiological exam (76.2%) and regarding the previous radiological exams and their impact (62.6%) (see Figure 2 Figure 2. Level of satisfaction with the mutual discussion on the received information. Chart shows doctor-patient satisfaction levels: satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very satisfied/dissatisfied on child presentation, exam details, and previous exam experiences. Most caregivers preferred to receive future information only from a healthcare professional (73.0%), while almost fourth preferred other sources in addition to the healthcare professional (25.5%), such as digital media (18.8%) and traditional media (3.5%). The majority preferred both verbal and written communication (62.4%), and approximately one-third preferred only verbal communication by a healthcare professional (34.4%). When asked about the healthcare provider they preferred to provide information, almost half of the respondents chose the referring physician (48.6%), while nearly the other half chose the radiologist (46.8%). Respondents preferred more information on the consequences of radiation exposure (83.3%), the type of radiation exam (37.9%), and the indication and rationale for radiation exposure (25.5%) ( Table 2 Table 2.

Discussion Effective communication has become a necessity in the modern paradigm of healthcare delivery. This is particularly important in radiological care, in which various radiological tests may lead to adverse outcomes, such as cancer and tissue damage. Research has suggested gaps in the quality of communication carried out by physicians and in knowledge among caregivers of children undergoing radiological tests. Exploring communication problems, discussion dynamics, professional knowledge gaps, and caregivers’ wishes may help inform interventions aiming to improve the quality of communication in radiological care. This study aimed to investigate the quality of communication and discussions between referring physicians and caregivers of children undergoing radiological tests and explore the future preferences of those caregivers. This study reported adequate satisfaction regarding communication with referring physicians. This aligns with the findings of one local study wherein patients perceived physicians as competent at delivering clear clinical information with compassion and respect.  34  24 This pattern of findings suggests that although physicians might have been competent in physician‒patient communication, they might not have adequately provided information and engaged in detailed discussions when this information was more radiology related. This might indicate a potential gap in understanding of radiological risks. This aligns with the findings of previous studies conducted among healthcare professionals in Palestine. One local study revealed that physicians’ knowledge, practices, and communication about radiological risks were suboptimal.  35  36  37  35 This is part of the bigger picture in which radiological safety in Palestine is overlooked in policy-making and practice. A local study revealed that radiographers did not routinely use radiation shielding tools to safeguard patients from radiation exposure despite providing adequate knowledge about radiation safety.  38 Multiple measures can be implemented by healthcare institutions to improve the communication of radiology information. First, communication should be emphasized in graduate medical education and training modules. An example of a relevant and practical training approach is human simulation programs that rely on simulated patients (SPs), who are individuals trained to imitate real patients following standardized scenarios.  39  40 These strategies can also benefit from established international frameworks, such as the WHO’s guide on communicating radiation risks in paediatric imaging, which outlines several professional‑ and patient‑centred communication approaches. For instance, it recommends that referring physicians hold simple, clear, benefit‑focused discussions with caregivers, after which radiologists can follow up with procedure- and dose-related details. The guide also emphasizes the need to involve all relevant healthcare workers, including referrers, radiographers, nurses, and receptionists, in enhancing communication by responding to questions, using educational materials, and adopting a simple language to ensure consistent, effective, and ongoing dialogue throughout the care pathway.  41 42 44 42 44 Furthermore, a considerable minority of the participants in the present study stated a preference for receiving information from multiple sources outside healthcare settings, such as traditional and digital media. In one study conducted among caregivers of children undergoing medical imaging, half of the participants preferred the internet as a source of radiological information.  31  45 Notably, in addition to providing verbal communication, some caregivers preferred written information provided by healthcare professionals in addition to verbal communication. Other studies have also reported that patients prefer receiving detailed yet simple written information related to radiological examinations. 24 46  31 What Parents Should Know about Medical Radiation Safety This study contributes to the scarce research assessing physicians’ communication and provision of medical information in the region, especially in the field of radiology. Moreover, the study sample was representative of the Palestinian population, as it included participants from almost every city in the West Bank. The sample size also exceeded that of other studies carried out among caregivers of children undergoing medical imaging globally. This study has several limitations. Although the findings are comparable with those of other studies conducted globally, most of these findings should not be generalized to other populations in different settings. This is because the gaps in healthcare communication can be attributed to the drawbacks of the national healthcare system, such as the lack of strategies, regulations, and stewardship. In addition to the peculiar social and cultural characteristics inherent in the population’s buildup, these characteristics influence many aspects of health service delivery. Furthermore, responses to questions measuring satisfaction often lean toward positivity, resulting in a positive skew. Moreover, the use of a convenient sampling method could not eliminate the inherent bias of subjective selection, thereby compromising internal validity. Additionally, the nature of the cross-sectional study design precluded the establishment of causality between the variables. Conclusion With the recent shift toward patient autonomy and patient-centered care, effective communication and informed discussion have become pillars of healthcare delivery. As potential complications may ensue from various radiological tests, effective exchange of information is crucial for making informed decisions and improving the quality of care. This study aimed to explore the adequacy of information and discussions between physicians referring children to radiological examinations and caregivers of those children. The study also aimed to identify the future preferences of caregivers concerning radiological care. Although the overall quality of communication was satisfactory, information exchange and discussions about radiological tests were inadequate. Caregivers also expressed a preference for receiving both verbal and written information from healthcare professionals, with a considerable minority preferring other sources of information, such as digital media. National health authorities and professional bodies should address the poor knowledge and communication among referring physicians by providing educational courses and developing effective policies to improve the quality of communication about the risks and benefits of radiological examinations. Moreover, the popularity of technology amounts to an added opportunity to complement the information received in radiological care. We would like to express our gratitude to all parents who participated in this study. We would also like to thank the Palestinian Ministry of Health for their kind approval and support for the data collection process.
