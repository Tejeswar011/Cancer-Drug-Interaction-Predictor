Introduction Gastric cancer remains one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with radical surgery serving as the primary treatment modality [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 In recent years, immunonutrients—such as arginine, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and nucleotides—have garnered attention for their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and gut-protective potential [ 8 9 10 11 To address these gaps, we designed a single-center, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical trial to investigate the effects of perioperative immunonutrients versus standard nutrient supplementation on intestinal mucosal barrier function and gut microbiota in gastric cancer patients. By measuring serum intestinal barrier markers like diamine oxidase, D-lactate, and endotoxin, as well as immune–inflammatory parameters, and by applying metagenomic sequencing to analyze microbiota composition and function, this study aims to address the following scientific questions: (1) Are immunonutrients superior to standard nutrients in improving intestinal mucosal barrier function? (2) Is the efficacy of immunonutrients associated with gut microbiota remodeling and metabolic pathway regulation? (3) How do dynamic changes in microbiota diversity and specific taxa influence clinical outcomes? 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design This single-center, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical trial evaluated the effects of perioperative immunonutrients versus standard nutrient supplementation on intestinal mucosal barrier function and gut microbiota in gastric cancer patients. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Approval No. K4073) and registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Registration No. ChiCTR2400084026). The trial was conducted from June 2023 to December 2024. 2.2. Participants Inclusion criteria included the following: aged 18–80 years, body mass index (BMI) 18.5–28 kg/m 2 2.3. Intervention Protocol Nutritional supplementation was administered in alignment with real-world clinical practice. The experimental group received a formula of immunonutrients, providing 128 mg nucleotides, 1.2 g arginine, and 282 mg ω-3 fatty acids (EPA + DHA) per 100 kcal. The control group received a formula of standard nutrients. Groups were labeled as follows: PUIA referred to the preoperative control group and PUIB referred to the postoperative control group. PUNA represented the preoperative immunonutrients group and PUNB represented the postoperative immunonutrients group. Preoperative Phase (3 days before surgery): Daily oral supplementation at 20 kcal/kg/day was provided for 3 days before surgery. Patients were permitted a low energy intake (e.g., water, rice soup), with total energy intake maintained below 40% of the requirements. Postoperative Phase Enteral nutrition was gradually reintroduced starting from the 3rd day after surgery, escalated to 20 kcal/kg/day as tolerated, and continued at this dose until the 14th day after surgery. Probiotics, immunomodulators, or other interventions affecting gut microbiota were prohibited throughout the study. 2.4. Data Collection 2.4.1. Immune and Nutritional Indicators Blood samples were collected 3 days preoperatively before nutrient supplementation (baseline) and on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days following surgery. Immune parameters (white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count, CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ T cell count, IgG, hypersensitive C-reactive protein) and nutritional parameters (albumin, prealbumin, total protein, hemoglobin) were analyzed by Automated Hematology Analyzer and Biochemical Analyzer. Among them, blood cell counting is mainly based on flow cytometry, and blood biochemical analysis is mainly based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 2.4.2. Intestinal Barrier Indicators Serum intestinal barrier markers (diamine oxidase, D-lactate, endotoxin) were quantified using “diamine oxidase, lactic acid, bacterial endotoxin assay kit” (Product Model: JY-Po-Color DLT Set). The device primarily consists of a base plate and reagent strips. The base plate is equipped with three reaction wells: a diamine oxidase (DAO) reaction well, a D-lactate (DLC) reaction well, and a bacterial endotoxin (BT) reaction well. (a) Diamine Oxidase (DAO) Activity Assay: Diamine oxidase in the blood oxidizes the substrate putrescine to generate H 2 2 2 2 12 13 2.4.3. Fecal Metagenomic Sequencing Fecal samples were collected 3 days preoperatively before nutrient supplementation and on the 14th day postoperatively. DNA was extracted directly from fecal samples. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to analyze microbiota composition and functional pathways. A total of 1 μg of genomic DNA per sample was randomly fragmented into ~350 bp fragments using a Covaris ultrasonicator. Libraries were then constructed through end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, purification, and PCR amplification. Libraries were preliminarily quantified using Qubit 2.0. Libraries were diluted to 2 ng/μL. Insert size was verified using Agilent 2100 (Agilent Technologies (China) Co., LTD., Beijing, China). Upon confirmation of expected insert size, library effective concentration was accurately quantified using Q-PCR (effective concentration > 3 nM). Qualified libraries were pooled according to effective concentration and target sequencing data volume, followed by PE150 sequencing. 2.4.4. Bioinformatics Analysis Raw data from the NovaSeq platform were preprocessed using fastp to obtain clean data for downstream analysis. Removal of paired reads if any read contained adapter sequences. Removal of paired reads if >50% of bases in any read had Q ≤ 5. Removal of paired reads if N content in any read exceeded 10%. For samples with host contamination, reads were aligned to host sequences using Bowtie2 (parameters: --end-to-end --sensitive -I 200 -X 400) to filter out host-derived reads [ 14 15 16 17 18 16 19 −5 20 14 21 22 21 22 14 23 −5 21 24 2.5. Statistical Analysis Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA in SPSS 26.0 [ 25 p p 25 2.6. Sample Size and Ethics A total of 72 patients were enrolled, with 8 excluded and 6 incomplete follow-ups (due to nutrient intolerance or postoperative complications), leaving 58 participants (29 patients per group) for final analysis. All procedures adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. The flowchart is shown in Figure 1 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive Analysis Baseline characteristics, including age, gender, BMI, AJCC stage, and surgical related parameters, showed no significant differences between the control and experimental groups (all p Table 1 3.2. Perioperative Immune and Nutrition Parameter Changes Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no statistically significant intergroup differences in immune or nutrition parameters ( Table 2 Figure 2 3.3.

Gene Differential Analysis Some enrolled patients failed to provide fecal samples of the 14th day after surgery due to irregular bowel movements, constipation, or absence of stool caused by a liquid diet. Complete preoperative and postoperative fecal samples were obtained from 20 patients in the experimental group and 20 in the control group. Metagenomic sequencing revealed potential differences in genomic complexity between the PUIA and PUIB groups based on non-redundant gene counts. Venn diagrams indicated that while most genes were shared across groups, hundreds of thousands of gene-level differences existed between them ( Supplementary Figure S1 3.4.1.

Differential Gene Function Analysis LEfSe analysis revealed significant differences in microbiota composition and functional pathways between PUIB and PUIA.

PUNB showed enrichment of Enterococcus faecalis Erysipelotrichales Enterocloster bolteae Streptococcus anginosus Prevotellaceae Bacillota Enterobacter Klebsiella aerogenes Erysipelotrichia Figure 7 Comparison of PUIA and PUIB revealed distinct virulence factor profiles. PUIB showed significant enrichment of virulence genes, including streptolysin O (VF0353) and Esp surface protein (VF0456), which promote cytolysis and biofilm formation. PUIA’s virulence profile was characterized by context-dependent activation (e.g., triggered by mucosal injury), reflecting baseline microbiota–pathogen interactions in the preoperative state. CAZy annotation highlighted divergent carbohydrate metabolism strategies between PUIA and PUIB. PUIA enriched glycoside hydrolase families (GH2, GH3, GH43) and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM48, CBM26), which facilitate dietary fiber degradation and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. In contrast, PUIB dominated GH1, GH4, and GH73 families, which degrade host glycoproteins/mucins and remodel pathogenic cell walls, exacerbating mucosal damage and inflammation ( Supplementary Figure S2 These findings suggest that postoperative microbiota in PUIB exhibit enhanced pathogenic potential through virulence factor activation and mucin-degrading enzyme expression, whereas preoperative microbiota (PUIA) prioritize fiber metabolism and barrier-supportive functions. 4. Discussion This study evaluated the regulatory effects of perioperative immunonutrient supplementation on intestinal mucosal barrier function and gut microbiota in gastric cancer patients through a randomized controlled trial. The results demonstrated that the immunonutrients group exhibited significantly lower postoperative levels of diamine oxidase and bacterial endotoxin compared to the standard nutrients group (both p Diamine oxidase, an enzyme located in the mitochondria of intestinal epithelial cells, directly reflects physical damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier when its plasma levels are elevated [ 26 p 27 28 29 30 31 10 11 32 33 34 35 p 36 37 38 39 The immunonutrients group appeared to exhibit significantly higher gut microbiota α-diversity (Shannon index) compared to the control group, with a core microbiota structure potentially characterized by probiotic dominance and pathogen suppression.

Conclusions Perioperative supplementation with immunonutrients significantly reduced postoperative diamine oxidase and endotoxin levels in gastric cancer patients, indicating the effective protection of intestinal mucosal barrier function by mitigating mucosal damage and suppressing endotoxin release.
