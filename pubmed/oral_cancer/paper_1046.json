This narrative review aims to explore the reproductive and fertility care needs of women with schizophrenia related to fertility, menstrual cycle, family planning, and the perinatal period. Hormonal fluctuations in the menstrual cycle can significantly affect clinical symptoms and the efficacy of contraceptive treatments in women with schizophrenia. When undergoing fertility treatment, attention should be given to the potential interactions between fertility treatment drugs and antipsychotics, as well as the potential impact of antipsychotics on the ability to conceive. Although pregnancy rates and participation in fertility programs have increased among women with schizophrenia, very little information is available on the safety and efficacy of fertility treatments in women with severe psychotic disorders. This is an area that warrants further study. Mobilizing social supports and optimizing medication are important components of the treatment of schizophrenia in the perinatal period and are important for the health and safety of infants and mothers. In conclusion, preventing relapse and promoting physical and mental health in this group of women during successive reproductive periods of life is vital and requires an emphasis on the social and psychiatric context, as well as the biological changes occurring at these times. schizophrenia psychosis pregnancy postpartum contraception family planning fertility This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder with a high burden of disease in men and women and similar prevalence between the sexes [ 1 2 The course of schizophrenia in men and women is different. Men diagnosed with schizophrenia show an earlier age of disorder onset than women, while women present a second peak of incidence at the time of menopause [ 3 Characteristic symptoms in men and women with schizophrenia dictate the appropriate interventions. Men with schizophrenia suffer more severe negative and cognitive symptoms than women, which may be associated with hormone levels and psychosocial risk factors [ 1 4 3 1 2 3 4 2 4 The prognosis in women, however, changes after menopause. At the time of menopause, psychosis in women becomes more treatment-refractory, the requirement for antipsychotic doses is higher, and adverse events are more common [ 5 6 7 8 9 Although both men and women with schizophrenia show social risk factors that affect the prognosis of the disorder, these factors impact women more than men [ 10 11 10 11 Women with schizophrenia have sex-specific gynecologic and obstetric care needs that remain inadequately addressed in current medical systems. They are less likely to receive medical screening, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing, regular gynecologic examination, cervical cancer screening, and family planning, than females without schizophrenia [ 9 9 2 Aims The goal of this narrative review is to explore the reproductive and fertility care needs of women with schizophrenia. Our aim was to address the following questions: (1) How do menstrual cycle phases impact clinical course in women with schizophrenia? (2) What are the important variables to recognize related to contraception and family planning in women with schizophrenia? (3) How effective and safe are fertility treatments for women with schizophrenia? (4) What are the clinical needs of women with schizophrenia during pregnancy and the postpartum period? 2. Methods 2.1. Screening and Selection of Evidence in Women with Schizophrenia We carried out a narrative review focused on reproductive and fertility care needs in women with schizophrenia. The PubMed database was searched with the following search terms: Schizophrenia AND (“menstrual cycle” OR “family planning” OR “contraception” OR “fertility treatments” OR “maternal health needs”). The menstrual cycle, family planning, and contraception were reviewed in order to introduce the topic of fertility treatments. Finally, maternal health needs were reviewed, specifically for women with schizophrenia suffering from infertility. We included papers published within the last ten years. Classic papers in the field were also included if they were considered a reference point in the field. We conducted a narrative review because it provides a flexible approach that allowed us to synthesize and give an overview of the limited available literature across this broad topic and to identify research gaps. Narrative reviews are helpful for exploring complex subjects such as reproductive and fertility care and family planning in women with schizophrenia and for generating hypotheses for future studies and clinical programs. Our main goal was to integrate the fragmented literature in this field, generate hypotheses for future research and clinical programs, and provide a general overview of the topic for learning purposes. 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Papers were included if they met the following criteria: (1) study participants were women suffering from schizophrenia or closely related disorders, (2) there was clinical information on menstrual cycle, family planning, fertility treatments, perinatal, or parenting needs, and (3) the language was English, French, Spanish, or German. Cohort studies, clinical trials, and other forms of research studies, as well as reviews, were included if judged by the authors to be of good methodologic quality. Case reports were excluded. 2.3. Reporting of Results We grouped the included papers into five categories: (1) menstrual cycle in women with schizophrenia, (2) family planning and contraception considerations, (3) fertility in women with schizophrenia, and (4) perinatal period in women with schizophrenia. 3. Results Assessment of menstrual cycle abnormalities and menstrual cycle-related symptom patterns is crucial when evaluating women with schizophrenia. In women of reproductive age, discussions about family planning are vital and should be followed up with discussions regarding contraception and/or conception, depending on a woman’s family planning preferences. In women who are planning to conceive, infertility should be carefully addressed, and, when relevant, fertility treatment options should be discussed. Furthermore, discussion of options for schizophrenia treatment in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for mitigating risks to the mother and child. This discussion should include the important roles of antipsychotic medication, support systems, and protection of sleep in the perinatal period. 3.1. Menstrual Cycle in Women with Schizophrenia Women with schizophrenia experience fluctuations in symptoms across the phases of their menstrual cycle. This is due to the effect of hormones, both directly on psychotic symptoms and also on antipsychotic blood levels. Certain, but not all, women with schizophrenia can experience fluctuations in psychotic symptom severity with changes in estrogen levels. During phases of the menstrual cycle when estrogen levels are low, psychotic symptom severity can increase; when estrogen in the bloodstream is elevated during the mid-luteal phase, symptom severity can decrease [ 4 12 13 14 Estrogens are known to have neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on the brain [ 8 15 16 Gonadal steroid levels can also alter enzyme activity involved in the metabolism of antipsychotic medications, thereby increasing or decreasing blood levels of certain antipsychotic drugs. For example, estrogen increases the levels of olanzapine and clozapine by inhibiting the metabolism of these drugs by the enzyme Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2); it decreases the levels of quetiapine through its effects on the enzyme Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) [ 16 Conversely, antipsychotic treatment may also affect hormone levels by increasing prolactin levels. The risk of hyperprolactinemia varies between antipsychotic drugs [ 17 18 19 20 3.2. Contraception and Family Planning in Women with Schizophrenia Historically, women with schizophrenia have had lower fertility rates than other women, possibly due to hyperprolactinemia caused by first-generation antipsychotic medications and the impact of negative symptoms on relationships [ 21 21 The discussion of family planning and sexuality is important for all reproductive-age women, including women with schizophrenia [ 22 23 24 25 26 Contraceptive efficacy is an important consideration. Women with schizophrenia are at high risk of unplanned pregnancy and rapid repeat pregnancy [ 27 28 29 30 For women with schizophrenia who wish to become pregnant, healthcare providers should engage in discussion about relationships, parenting, and treatment options and preferences for a future perinatal period. This conversation should include discussion of the impact of antipsychotics on fertility, efficacy of alternative antipsychotic regimens that do not raise prolactin levels for the individual, relapse prevention, and mobilization of family support in the perinatal period [ 20 Due to the high rates of unplanned pregnancy, a discussion of treatment options in pregnancy should be offered to all women of reproductive age with schizophrenia [ 29 30 While certain antipsychotics have been well studied with overall reassuring findings in pregnancy and are recognized to be generally low risk (haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole) [ 31 32 Interventions to increase support networks can help mitigate the risk of worsening the disorder and help her transition to motherhood. Each woman’s needs must be assessed individually. Mobilization of social supports is essential, including linking her to available resources for pregnant and new mothers, involving family members, and helping the expectant mother to take prenatal vitamins, stop smoking, attend prenatal appointments, create a plan to protect sleep postpartum, and with childcare. Close monitoring of symptoms through pregnancy and the postpartum period is important. Sleep disorders should be evaluated, and early interventions should be offered. The postpartum period is a particularly high-risk period for psychosis relapse due to the drastic drop in estrogen after delivery, sleep deprivation, and the new responsibility of caring for an infant [ 33 Table 1 3.3. Fertility Treatments in Women with Schizophrenia Simoila and collaborators [ 34 High levels of stress, the impact of illness on relationships, antipsychotic side effects (i.e., Hyperprolactinemia), and medical and psychiatric comorbidity can impact fertility in women with schizophrenia [ 20 35 36 37 38 3.3.1. Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Programs Few women with schizophrenia participate in ART programs (although exact numbers are unknown), and very few studies have specifically investigated the safety and efficacy of fertility treatments in women with schizophrenia. Yli-Kuha et al. studied a cohort of 9175 women who had undergone in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), or frozen embryo transfer (FET) in Finland [ 39 39 39 In a cohort of 42,915 Danish women receiving assisted reproductive treatment (ART) between 1994 and 2009, ref. [ 40 3.3.2. Safety of Fertility Treatments Few studies have examined the safety of fertility treatments specifically in women with schizophrenia. Women with schizophrenia are often excluded from studies of fertility treatments, limiting the generalizability of both efficacy and safety to this population. Areas for study include the potential interactions between medications used in ART and antipsychotic medications, and also whether ART is associated with the risk of relapse of schizophrenia. Medications used in fertility treatment and antipsychotic drugs can have pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 In a cohort of 98,320 women referred for treatment, Baldur-Felskov and collaborators [ 48 48 3.3.3. Effectiveness of Fertility Treatments Psychopharmacological treatment of schizophrenia (particularly antipsychotics) may be relevant to the effectiveness of ART programs. Certain antipsychotics can induce hyperprolactinemia, which impacts fertility. Hyperprolactinemia may need to be reversed by switching to prolactin-sparing antipsychotics prior to ART [ 49 Table 2 3.4. Pregnancy and Postpartum Health Needs in Women with Schizophrenia Women diagnosed with schizophrenia have reported that being a mother is the most important thing in their lives, as it provides meaning and focus, and children motivate them to stay healthy [ 50 51 In a study of 75 women with psychotic disorders in England, the authors compared women with psychosis who had children with those who did not [ 52 3.4.1. Prevention and Treatment of Psychotic Disorder Relapse in Postpartum Women with Schizophrenia For mothers with schizophrenia who have young children, close monitoring can mitigate the risk of relapse and associated consequences. Maintenance of antipsychotic and psychological treatment and monitoring of parental stress require frequent clinical assessment [ 53 54 3.4.2. Special Attention in the Perinatal Period The postpartum period is a particularly vulnerable time for women with schizophrenia. This period is associated with increased risk of relapse and hospitalization [ 55 Seeman reports that mothers with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders may present with perinatal syndromes such as delusional denial of pregnancy, postpartum psychosis, and postpartum delusional misidentification syndrome [ 56 57 58 A recent study reported that psychological interventions for women with postpartum psychosis can help promote trust, improve feelings of connectedness, re-establish relationships, process feelings of loss, manage fear of relapse, and plan for their future [ 59 50 3.4.3. Support for the Mother-Infant Relationship Women with schizophrenia require additional support and parental training in practical baby care skills. They may at first be insensitive to their infant’s needs and need encouragement to bond with their infants [ 56 60 The fear of custody loss is one of the most frequent concerns reported by women with schizophrenia caring for children [ 50 51 56 50 Parenting assessment and support services need to be a public health priority. The antipsychotic side effect of blunted affect can be mistaken for a lack of interest in their child [ 51 60 3.4.4. Reduction in Stigma Women with schizophrenia who become mothers face stigma. Many members of society believe that their disorder deprives them of the ability to be good enough mothers or to care for their children [ 50 51 3.4.5. Economic, Occupational, and Vocational Help Linking mothers with schizophrenia to services that provide income supplementation (e.g., loans, food banks, safe housing options) can help them to meet basic living needs [ 56 Table 3 Figure 1 4. Discussion Women with schizophrenia have specific reproductive and fertility care needs that differ from those of men and that need to be considered when providing healthcare [ 61 Before menopause, certain women with schizophrenia experience symptom fluctuation across the menstrual cycle, which has been attributed to the effects of hormones both directly on psychotic symptoms and on the metabolism of antipsychotic medication [ 4 12 62 14 4 Family planning and contraception are important areas to discuss with women with schizophrenia. Improving access to family planning services for women with schizophrenia is crucial. This enables women to make informed decisions about reproduction, including contraceptive choice and family planning. A recent cross-sectional study in women suffering from mental disorders found that injectable and oral contraceptive pills were the most commonly used methods of contraception in those women [ 63 64 65 When treating women with schizophrenia who would like to conceive, common causes of infertility in this population of women should be evaluated. One common cause of infertility in women with schizophrenia is hyperprolactinemia, which is often associated with antipsychotic medication use [ 17 20 66 67 Birth rates are increasing in women with schizophrenia, in part due to the use of antipsychotics that affect prolactin less and in part due to improved treatment of schizophrenia [ 21 68 The use of fertility treatments is low among women with schizophrenia. Furthermore, there is a lack of data regarding the safety and effectiveness of such treatments for these women. Potential drug interactions should be considered when combining fertility drugs and antipsychotics. Around 30–50% of antipsychotics are metabolized by CYP2D6, which is also the main enzyme responsible for metabolizing clomiphene, a treatment to promote ovulation [ 47 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 Women with schizophrenia are frequently excluded from studies on fertility treatments due to concerns about the potential impact of fertility medications on mental health symptoms and because of the lack of data on the safety of these treatments in this population of women with severe mental disorders [ 49 49 69 Likely barriers for women with schizophrenia to access fertility treatment programs include socioeconomic factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, insurance, and education level), language, racial disparities, and culture [ 70 71 72 Women with schizophrenia from low-income countries may experience further barriers to accessing evidence-based fertility treatment. In low-income countries, access to infertility treatments is often limited or unavailable [ 73 73 Close collaboration between reproductive health interventions and mental health providers, including co-located services, may improve access to fertility treatments for women with schizophrenia with infertility who would like to conceive and become mothers, and it can also improve mental health outcomes in the perinatal period [ 74 75 Women with schizophrenia caring for young children have specific healthcare needs that require multidisciplinary approaches. The postpartum period is a period of increased vulnerability for women with schizophrenia. In addition to psychopharmacologic treatment, mobilization of social supports, parenting supports, healthy diet, sleep hygiene, and exercise can help reduce the risk of psychotic exacerbation in women with schizophrenia in the perinatal period and operate as preventive interventions [ 54 76 In summary, women with schizophrenia have specific reproductive and fertility care needs compared to men. These specific health needs should be assessed and addressed in specialized healthcare settings where possible [ 77 Limitations and Strengths This review has several limitations. The majority of studies of schizophrenia course across reproductive events did not assess hormone levels, which would be important for evaluating the potential associations between hormonal changes and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, few studies examined the use of fertility treatments in women with schizophrenia. This limits the generalizability of the efficacy of fertility programs to women on antipsychotic medications and the safety of fertility treatments to women with schizophrenia. Currently, limited literature exists on the reproductive and fertility care needs of women with schizophrenia, and this review highlights the need for future studies in this area to support women with schizophrenia as they make decisions regarding family planning and contraception and to optimize ways to maintain stability through the perinatal period. 5. Conclusions This review highlights reproductive and fertility care needs that require attention for women with schizophrenia. Changes in hormone levels across the menstrual cycle can impact clinical symptoms in women with schizophrenia. Sex hormones have a direct effect on psychotic symptoms, and they also affect blood levels of some, but not all, antipsychotic medications. Certain hormonal contraceptive medications can impact antipsychotic medication levels as well. For women with schizophrenia who would like to conceive, recognition of the impact that certain antipsychotic medications can have on the ability to conceive is imperative. There is little information about the safety and overall effectiveness of fertility treatments in women with schizophrenia, and this is an area that warrants study. Finally, continued psychiatric treatment and establishing support for the mother during the perinatal period help reduce the risks of a worsening clinical course and are important for the health of the mother and the child. Close collaboration between the obstetric and mental health teams can improve monitoring and medical care during the perinatal period. Future studies should focus on identifying and reducing barriers that women with schizophrenia face when accessing infertility treatment. Future studies should also investigate the safety and efficacy of fertility treatments in this population. Findings from these studies can then inform policies to reduce disparities in access to fertility care. Programs to help reduce stress, increase socialization, and provide educational support for parenting are important components of treatment during the perinatal period.
