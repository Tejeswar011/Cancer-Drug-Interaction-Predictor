The pathophysiology of MASLD is complex, with oxidative stress and insulin resistance (IR) playing central roles in its development and progression ( 1 2 3 4 5 Studies have shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) plays a critical role in the onset and progression of IR ( 6 7 8 8 9 9 7 10 11 12 12 13 13 Heterophyllin B (HP-B) is a cyclopeptide compound derived from plants that has shown significant progress in research on blood glucose regulation and anti-inflammatory effects in recent years ( 14 16 14 17 Materials and methods Cell culture HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cell lines were purchased from Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd. STR profiling was used for authentication. The cells were cultured in DMEM (MedChemExpress) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 μ μ 18 μ μ Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells were seeded at a density of 5×10 3 μ μ μ 2 Oil Red O staining Following treatment of the HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells, the media was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The cells in each well were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). The cells were subsequently stained with 0.5% Oil Red O solution at room temperature for 10 min. After staining, the excess dye was removed by washing with 60% isopropanol, followed by three washes with distilled water (5 min each wash) to prevent non-specific binding of the dye. Under an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation), the cells were examined, and images of representative fields were acquired. Determination of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels Following the treatment of HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells, the supernatants were collected. For the liver tissue samples, a homogenizer was used to homogenize the liver tissue. The samples were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C and 12,000 × g, after which the supernatants were collected. The TG and TC levels were measured by TG (cat. no. A110-1-1) and mouse total cholesterol ELISA kit (cat. no. A111-1-1; both from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) Following the manufacturer's instructions, TRIzol reagent (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) was used to extract total RNA from HepG2 and Huh-7 human liver cancer cells. The concentration and purity (2.0> OD260/280 >1.8) of the RNA were determined using a Multiskan SkyHigh nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Following the instructions supplied by the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Inc.), 1 μ −ΔΔCq −ΔΔCq 19 Detection of ROS levels HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells were plated at a density of 3×10 5 μ Detection of mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) levels HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3×10 5 μ Detection of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3×10 5 μ Western blot analysis The HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells or liver tissues were collected and lysed using a RIPA lysis solution (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) on ice for 30 min. The samples were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C and 12,000 × g. The protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein samples (20 μ Establishment of animal model In this experiment, a total of 45 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice [weight, 20-22 g; SiPeiFu, (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd.] were randomly assigned to 9 experimental groups, with 5 mice per group. The first phase of the experiment included the following groups: i) control group (Con), in which the mice were fed a standard chow diet with daily oral vehicle (10% DMSO/corn oil, 200 μ μ μ 20 μ In the second phase (initiated after 8 weeks of HFD induction), the mice received a single tail vein injection of adenovirus (Day 0), followed by 8 weeks of intervention. To ensure sustained GLP-1R knockdown, Ad-sh-GLP-1R [5'-AGT GTCTGAAGCCAACAAGGA-3', designed against the mouse GLP-1R mRNA ( NM_021332 μ 11 μ μ 11 The mice were housed under standard laboratory conditions with free access to water at a temperature of 24°C and a humidity of 45%, with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. Anesthesia was induced with 3-5% isoflurane, and deep anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of a response to pain stimuli; 2% isoflurane was used to maintain anesthesia during the procedures. At the end of the experimental period, all mice were euthanized under deep anesthesia with isoflurane (5% in oxygen), followed by cervical dislocation to ensure death. Death was confirmed by the cessation of heartbeat and respiratory movement, as well as the loss of reflexes. In the first phase of the experiment, all the mice were sacrificed at the end of the 8-week HFD treatment, and blood and liver tissue samples were collected for analysis. For the IF group all the mice were sacrificed within 48 h after the last fasting cycle. The mice from all the groups were sacrificed at the end of the experiment (after 8 weeks). Blood samples were collected from the heart, and liver samples were obtained. In addition, liver weights were recorded. The body weights were measured regularly, and the liver index (liver weight/body weight) was calculated. Additionally, liver histology, serum marker assessment of liver function, and gene/protein expression analysis were performed to assess the effects of the treatments. The present study was conducted in strict accordance with ethical guidelines for animal research and all applicable national regulations. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (approval no. 2023-KY-064-1; Beijing, China). All procedures were designed to minimize animal suffering, and humane care was provided throughout the study. In addition, all the animal experiments complied with the ARRIVE guidelines and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Insulin tolerance test (ITT) ITT was conducted by first administering an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of insulin at a dose of 1 U/kg body weight to induce insulin action. Blood samples were then collected from the tail tip at 0, 15-, 30-, 45-, 60- and 90-min post-injection to measure blood glucose levels using a portable glucometer. Glucose tolerance test (GTT) Prior to the GTT, the mice were fasted for 6 h (with free access to water) to standardize the baseline blood glucose levels. The baseline blood glucose value was measured at 0 min (pre-injection) via tail-tip blood sampling. A sterile glucose solution (20% w/v) was then administered via IP injection at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight. Blood samples were subsequently collected from the tail tip at 15-, 30-, 45, 60- and 120-min post-glucose loading, and blood glucose levels were analyzed at each time point using a portable glucometer. H&E staining The liver tissues were collected and fixed for 24 h in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). The fixed liver tissues were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 6- μ Determination of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels The serum levels of AST and ALT were measured in accordance with the guidelines provided by the AST Assay Kit (cat. no. C010-2-1) and ALT activity assay kit (cat. no. C009-2-1; both from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute). The absorbance was measured at 510 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Detection of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels MDA levels in liver tissues were measured using MDA assay kit (cat. no. A003-1-2; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) following the manufacturer's instructions. Small interfering (siRNA) transfection HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells were plated at a density of 3×10 5 μ μ μ μ Statistical analysis The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviations (SDs). Two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests were used to compare two groups, and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used to compare three or more groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Results HP-B and fasting work together to counteract OA/PA-induced lipid accumulation in liver cells CCK-8 analysis revealed that treatment with 10, 25 and 50 μ μ Fig. 1A and B μ Fig. 1C and D Fig. 1C and D Fig. 1E-H Fig. 1E-H Fig. 1I and J Fig. 1I and J Combined HP-B and fasting treatment reverses the OA/PA-induced decrease in the MMP Assessment of the ROS levels in HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells revealed that OA/PA treatment increased the ROS levels compared with those in the Con group. However, HP-B treatment and fasting substantially reduced this increase in ROS levels in both the HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells ( Fig. 2A-D Fig. 2A-D Fig. 2E-H Fig. 2I and J Combined HP-B and fasting treatment reverses the OA/PA-induced decrease in GLP-1R and PGC1α To evaluate the effects of HP-B and fasting on the expression of GLP-1R and PGC1α, the mRNA levels of GLP-1R and PGC1α were examined in HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells. Compared with the Con group, OA/PA significantly decreased the mRNA levels of GLP-1R and PGC1α, whereas HP-B treatment and fasting reversed the OA/PA-induced reduction in the mRNA levels of GLP-1R and PGC1α ( Fig. 3A-D Fig. 3A-D Fig. 3E and F Fig. 3E and F Combined HP-B and fasting treatment reverses lipid accumulation in the livers of HFD-fed mice Compared with the Con group, the HFD group presented significantly impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity, indicating HFD-induced IR ( Fig. 4A and B Fig. 4B Fig. 4A and B Fig. 4A and B Fig. 4C and D Fig. 4C and D Fig. 4E-G Fig. 4E-G Fig. 4H Fig. 4H Fig. 4I and J Fig. 4K Fig. 4K GLP-1R silencing reverses OA/PA-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 and Huh-7 liver cancer cells si-GLP-1R or NC were then transfected into HepG2 and Huh-7 cells which were not combined with any other treatments. RT-qPCR analysis showed that the mRNA level of GLP-1R was decreased in HepG2 and Huh-7 cells compared with those of NC ( Fig. 5A and C Fig. 5B and D Fig. 5B and D Fig. 5B and D Fig. 5E Fig. 5F-I GLP-1R knockdown reverses the hepatoprotective effects of fasting and HP-B treatment in HFD-fed mice As shown in Fig. 6A Fig. 6B and C Fig. 6D and E Fig. 6D and E Fig. 6F and G Fig. 6F and G Fig. 6H Fig. 6I Fig. 6J and K Fig. 6L and M Fig. 6L and M Discussion Previous studies have demonstrated that IF effectively improves MASLD by modulating metabolism, reducing fat accumulation, and mitigating inflammatory responses ( 5 21 22 14 16 In the context of metabolic disease therapeutics, GLP-1R agonists have emerged as key pharmacologic agents because of their multifaceted benefits in glycemic control, weight reduction and cardiovascular risk mitigation ( 23 24 23 24 Previous research on HP-B has focused primarily on its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities, with applications largely confined to tumor suppression, neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive disorders ( 16 20 25 Previous studies have shown that the activation of GLP-1R regulates lipid metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis via the AMPK/PGC1α signaling axis ( 26 27 26 27 To ensure the reproducibility and physiological relevance of the present results, a well-structured and widely accepted 5:2 IF protocol was adopted. Prior studies have shown that this regimen activates glucocorticoid (GC) signaling, which contributes to metabolic reprogramming by upregulating Pck1 expression and enhancing fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis ( 4 28 Despite these promising findings, the present study has certain limitations. Although reproducible, the OA/PA-induced in vitro in vivo In summary, the present study elucidates the mechanism by which HP-B treatment improves lipid metabolism, protects mitochondrial function, and alleviates oxidative stress through activation of the GLP-1R/PGC1α axis. The combination of HP-B treatment and IF has significant synergistic effects and offers a low-toxicity, mechanistically grounded intervention strategy for the treatment of MASLD.
