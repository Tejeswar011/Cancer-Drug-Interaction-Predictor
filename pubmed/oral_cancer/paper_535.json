Secondary aims were to compare other clinical outcomes, total bacterial count, and relative expression levels of certain pro-inflammatory mediators following the use of locally and systemically delivered adjuvant antibiotics during the initial non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). Material and methods A total of 38 periodontitis stage III grade B or C patients were randomly and equally assigned to receive either local (LA) (tazobactam + piperacillin preparation) or systemic antibiotics (SA) (amoxicillin and metronidazole combination) during NSPT. Clinical periodontal parameters (periodontal probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, and plaque index), and microbiological and immunological parameters: total bacterial count, and relative expression levels of IL-17 and TNF-α were evaluated at baseline and six months after NSPT. Results Both LA and SA significantly improved all clinical parameters after six months ( p p p p Conclusions The adjuvant use of piperacillin + tazobactam led to the comparable improvement of clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters to the conventional use of amoxicillin and metronidazol combination six months following the initial therapy of periodontitis. Therefore, these locally delivered antibiotics might be a promising alternative to the standard use of systemic amoxicillin and metronidazol combination during initial therapy of stage III periodontitis. http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004564 Ministarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i TehnoloÅ¡kog Razvoja Grant No. 451-03-66/2024-03/ 200129 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5664-7848 Milinkovic Iva Italmed - https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5664-7848 Milinkovic Iva This study was funded by Grant No. 451-03-66/2024-03/ 200129.

Introduction Periodontitis is a chronic, multifactorial inflammatory disease resulting in periodontal attachment loss and tooth‐supporting tissues’ progressive destruction. It is characterised by microbially-associated and host‐mediated inflammation [ 1 2 2 3 3 The current literature provides numerous data on the roles of various pro-inflammatory mediators in the mechanisms of periodontitis progression. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is considered a key cytokine playing a critical role in the innate response against the periodontal pathogens [ 4 5 6 7 8 Non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) is the initial treatment phase, a crucial and integral therapy part. The goal of NSPT is the removal of all bacterial deposits and the reduction of inflammation by means of mechanical debridement. The reduction of bacterial count below individual threshold levels of inflammation/disease establishes an adequate infection control [ 9 10 12 10 Nevertheless, the development of bacterial resistance due to the overuse of antibiotics has raised global concerns nowadays, leading to very strict recommendations for prescribing systemic antibiotics [ 13 13 14 13 15 Particularly, the beneficial changes after NSPT in the subgingival microbial composition, accompanied by important and sustained clinical improvements, were achieved with the adjuvant use of metronidazole and amoxicillin combination [ 16 in vitro 17 18 In addition to the use of systemic antibiotics, the adjunctive use of locally delivered subgingival antimicrobials may also be considered in periodontitis patients during NSPT [ 13 19 20 21 16 22 23 Bearing in mind the somewhat controversial data found in present-day literature, the null hypothesis of the present study was set, stating that there was no statistically significant difference in periodontal probing depth between patients receiving systemic antibiotics and those receiving local antibiotics as an adjunct to NSPT. Accordingly, the primary aim of the present study was to compare the reduction of periodontal probing depth after the use of local and systemic adjuvant antibiotics during NSPT, at baseline and six months following the treatment. Furthermore, the secondary aims were differentiating the other clinical outcomes, along with total bacterial count and relative expression levels of certain pro-inflammatory mediators following the use of locally and systemically delivered adjuvant antibiotics during NSPT. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Participants, sample size calculation, study design, and data collection The present single-blinded randomised clinical study included a total of 38 individuals. All participants were recruited at the Department of Periodontology and Oral Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, University of Belgrade, from 17/01/2023–11/03/2024. The laboratory procedures were conducted in the Laboratory for Molecular Biology, Implant-Research Centre, School of Dental Medicine, University of Belgrade. The research was approved by the Ethical Committee of the School of Dental Medicine prior to study initiation (written consent No 36/6). The research was conducted in full accordance with the 2013 revision of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. All patients signed the written informed consent before inclusion in the study. The informed consent was previously waived by the Ethical Committee of the School of Dental Medicine. Soon after the research approval was obtained from the institutional ethical committee in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began; therefore, the patient recruitment did not start until 2023. Since the European Federation of Periodontology guideline for periodontitis treatment was published in the meantime [ 11 NCT 05608564 The inclusion criteria were: Individuals 18–40 years old; Active periodontitis stage III according to the latest criteria, grade B or C [ 1 Non-smokers and light smokers (up to 10 cigarettes/day). The exclusion criteria were: Individuals younger than 18 years of age (minors); Presence of systemic diseases affecting the tooth-supporting apparatus and bone metabolism (uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cancer, immunodeficiency, metabolic bone diseases); Patients receiving an immunosuppressive, anti-resorptive or anti-inflammatory therapy; Allergy to penicillin; Periodontal therapy within the last 6 months; Use of local and/or systemic antimicrobials within the last 6 months; Use of oral anti-plaque mouthwash at least one month prior to the study; Alcohol or drug abuse; Pregnancy or lactation. The sample size calculation was based on the requirements of the first phase study and used data from an earlier study [ 24 25 The patients were assessed for eligibility in the study. Following the initial evaluation of 50 individuals, seven patients were excluded due to not fulfilling the study inclusion criteria, and five patients declined to participate in the trial. Finally, 38 participants were allocated in the intervention arm. There were no dropouts during the study protocol ( Fig 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0333342.g001 Fig 1 The flow-diagram for the randomised clinical study. Clinical periodontal parameters such as periodontal probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP) [ 26 27 28 Participants were randomly assigned into two groups: 1) LA group, consisting of 19 patients receiving the adjuvant local antibiotics during NSPT; 2) SA group, with 19 patients receiving the adjuvant systemic antibiotics during NSPT. After meeting all the inclusion criteria, prior to treatment, allocation of patients was done by a different investigator (I.M.) who was not involved in examining or treating the patients. This allocation concealment was done in order to eliminate sampling bias where the one investigator (M.V.) examined all patients and another (A.Dj.K.) treated all patients. During the course of the treatment, outcome assessor (M.V.) was blinded to the treatment allocations. The patients were randomly allocated by drawing opaque sealed envelopes with cards coded with LA and SA in order to determine one antibiotic protocol. All NSPTs were performed by a single therapist (A.Dj.K.). Both patients and the therapist were strictly instructed not to inform the examiner if they had received systemic or locally delivered antibiotics. The examiner (M.V.) had no access to dental records and was not present when NSPT or administration of antibiotics in the LA group was performed. The allocation to the intervention group was not revealed until the data set had been locked. Prior to NSPT, the samples of subgingival gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were taken from each participant, from the selected periodontal pocket in the premolar/molar region. The pocket with the highest PPD, exceeding 5 mm, always in the first quadrant, was selected for sampling. In the relatively dry working field the paper points No. 30 (DiaDent; Cheongju-si, South Korea) were inserted in periodontal pocket for at least 30 s and transferred into sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) containing RNAlater stabilization solution (RNAlater; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), refrigerated (2–8 °C) overnight, after which the solution was removed and the samples were stored at −80 °C pending further analysis. 2.2. Non-surgical periodontal therapy After GCF collection, all patients underwent NSPT according to the full-mouth disinfection 29 In the LA group, the combination of piperacillin + tazobactam (Gelcide; Italmed MedTechDental, Florence, Italy) was delivered 24 h after the NSPT completion in order to allow relatively dry working field without post-interventional bleeding. The single-delivery protocol for the local antibiotic solution was used. The application of the solution in the periodontal pockets with PPD ≥ 4 mm was performed using a syringe with a blunt needle in six points around the tooth, three buccally and three orally (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-oral, mid-oral, disto-oral). The application continued until liquid flowed over the gingival margin. The local antibiotic delivery was carried out in all regions of both jaws during the same visit; afterwards, additional drying of the area was performed during the next 5 minutes. Patients were instructed not to rinse their mouth with water 15 minutes after the procedure. In the SA group, systemic antibiotics were prescribed after NSPT. The combination of amoxicillin (Amoxicillin; Hemofarm, Vršac, Serbia) 500 mg three times daily and metronidazole (Metronidazole; Alkaloid, Skopje, North Macedonia) 400 mg three times daily was used in a 7-day regimen [ 13 The patients were scheduled for follow-up appointments six months after the treatment to perform control periodontal charting and GCF sampling. 2.3. Laboratory procedures Both RNA and DNA were extracted from the samples collected from the patients at the baseline and at the six-month follow-up appointment. For both extractions, TRIzol reagent (TRIzol; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. DNA samples were used for total bacteria quantification by quantitative PCR (qPCR) as described previously [ 30 Prevotella melaninogenica From the RNA samples, cDNA was synthesised using a reverse transcription kit (RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1 µg of total RNA. Relative gene expression of IL-17 and TNF-α was evaluated using quantitative PCR analysis, as described previously [ 31 2.4. Reproducibility and methodological details All materials used, including specific brands, models, and dosages, are explicitly detailed in the Methods section. The local antibiotics, piperacillin + tazobactam (Gelcide; Italmed MedTechDental, Florence, Italy), were applied using a syringe with a blunt needle, in six points per tooth, until liquid overflowed over the gingival margin, with application performed in all regions of both jaws during the same session. Systemic antibiotics comprising amoxicillin (500 mg) and metronidazole (400 mg) combination were administered orally three times daily for 7 days, with patient compliance monitored via daily logbooks. Both antibiotics and other reagents, such as TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), and reverse transcription kits (RevertAid; Thermo Fisher Scientific), were used following manufacturer instructions. The periodontal probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque index (PI) were recorded with a standardized periodontal probe (UNC-15 Hu-Friedy), by a calibrated examiner, following standardized measurement points on each tooth. Subgingival plaque sampling involved inserting sterile paper points (No. 30; DiaDent) into the periodontal pocket for at least 30 seconds, then transferring to RNAlater stabilization solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and storing samples at −80°C until analysis. Molecular procedures included RNA and DNA extraction per manufacturer instructions, with DNA used for bacterial quantification by qPCR targeting 16S rRNA gene regions (primers: Fw 5′-TCCTACGGGAGCACAGT-3′, Rv 5′-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3′), and RNA for cytokine expression analysis via reverse transcription and qPCR. All procedures, from sample collection to laboratory analysis, were performed in accordance with standard protocols and manufacturer guidelines, ensuring reproducibility and consistency across all samples. 2.5. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis; however, in this study, no dropouts were reported during the observational period. Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software (GraphPad Prism version 9.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and (IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). For numerical data, mean values, medians, standard deviations (SD) and ranges were used for description. The distributions of all outcome values were examined using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test, and since none followed a normal distribution, measurements at the baseline and the sixth-month follow-up within the two treatment groups were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Comparisons in measurements between the two treatment groups were done using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann–Whitney U test). The significance was set at p 3. Results 3.1. Clinical results The present study included 38 individuals in total, of which 60.5% were female and 39.5% were male. Out of 19 patients allocated into LA group, 11 were female and 8 male, while the SA group consisted of 12 female and 7 male participants. The mean values and standard deviations for clinical measurements for PPD, CAL, BOP and PI were presented in Table 1 p p Fig 2a d 10.1371/journal.pone.0333342.t001 Table 1 Mean Values and Standard Deviations (Mean [±SD]) of Clinical Parameters: periodontal probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque index (PI) at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up in local (LA) and systemic (SA) antibiotic group.

Total bacterial count The clinical results were also reflected at the bacterial level, as evidenced by a significant reduction in the total bacterial count. Namely, an approximately ten-fold decrease of total mean [±SD] bacterial count was observed after both local (from 1.87 × 10 9 9 8 8 p 9 9 8 8 p p Fig 3 10.1371/journal.pone.0333342.g003 Fig 3 Total bacterial count values at baseline and six months after treatment using systemic and local antibiotic treatment. ** - p p 3.3. Relative gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines Although a reduction in local inflammation was expected based on the abovementioned findings, this was not reflected at the gene expression level for selected pro-inflammatory cytokines. To be more precise, the relative gene expression levels of IL-17 and TNF-α did not differ significantly between the two applied antibiotic protocols, nor were they affected significantly by the treatment itself ( p Fig 4 10.1371/journal.pone.0333342.g004 Fig 4 Difference in (a) IL-17, and (b) TNF-α relative gene expression levels between baseline and six months after treatment using systemic and local antibiotic treatment. *ns – not significant. 4. Discussion NSPT reduces the infectious burden in periodontal pockets, subsequently breaking the chain of the disease progression. However, despite NSPT alone lowering the number of some periodontal pathogens, it does not seem to alter the composition of the subgingival biofilm sufficiently for the beneficial bacterial species to colonise the periodontal pockets more definitively [ 16 32 16 10 16 20 The present study demonstrated the significant improvement of all clinical periodontal parameters six months following NSPT, accompanied by both locally and systemically delivered antibiotics. Importantly, no significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding clinical parameters, neither at the beginning of the therapy, nor six months afterwards. Therefore, the null hypothesis was not rejected. In addition, the application of both antibiotic protocols significantly reduced total bacterial count, although no significant differences between the two groups were noted six months later. Similarly to the present report, the improvement of periodontitis clinical presentation following the adjuvant use of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination in NSPT has been thoroughly scientifically documented. Precisely, the significant advancement of clinical parameters, accompanied by deep sites further reduction from 3 months to even 1-year post-treatment, was demonstrated [ 16 33 34 10 16 33 When considering the effectiveness of the adjuvant local antibiotics with NSPT, the state of the art on this topic remains somewhat controversial. The results of this study were in line with a recent meta-analysis reporting the beneficial effect of locally administered antibiotics during NSPT on clinical outcomes [ 20 35 36 37 Previous literature reports were assessing a wide variety of local antimicrobial preparations, with different antimicrobials’ delivering systems, rendering their analysis rather complicated. Importantly, unlike many available reports, the combination of piperacillin + tazobactam was used in the present study. Piperacillin is a semisynthetic, extended-spectrum ureidopenicillin whose susceptibility to hydrolysis was reduced by combining it with tazobactam, an irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases [ 38 38 39 in vitro 40 Treponema denticola Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. Polymorphum Parvimona micra Fusobacterium periodonticum 41 The current literature provides only scarce information on the adjuvant use of locally delivered piperacillin + tazobactam during NSPT. Compared to our observations, another study also showed a significantly lower composite count of selected pathogens during the follow-up [ 41 41 16 It might be stated that the locally delivered antibiotic protocol used in the present study could be beneficial in terms of maintaining the clinical results short-termly and postponing the periodontal pathogens’re-emergence with subsequent periodontal inflammation recurrence. Particularly, the form of locally delivered piperacillin + tazobactam used in this study might be advantageous in terms of longer sustainability (7–10 days) at the place of application [ 42 35 Conversely, one of the few studies in the available literature on the use of piperacillin + tazobactam in NSPT performed clinical controls up to six months after the initial periodontal therapy, although NSPT and administration of local antibiotics were repeated at three months. The authors concluded that despite local adjunctive use of piperacillin + tazobactam improving clinical outcomes of NSPT compared to NSPT alone, these results were not maintained over time, and so a more persistent local application was necessary [ 40 As for immunological parameters evaluated in this study, no significant differences in IL-17 and TNF-α relative level were reported, neither between the used antibiotic protocols, nor did the applied treatment have an impact on them. Despite the level of pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α has been used in identification, severity estimation, and periodontitis progression [ 5 43 44 43 Furthermore, TNF-α is secreted also by the Th-17 cells, along with their signature cytokine IL-17 and numerous other pro-inflammatory mediators [ 45 7 31 46 47 48 It should be highlighted once more that the present study failed to demonstrate any significant differences between the two antibiotic protocols on clinical, microbiological and cytokine presentation six months after NSPT. Recently, a retrospective study demonstrated similar clinical and microbiological observations three months following NSPT with either systemically or locally delivered antibiotics [ 23 16 49 50 On the other hand, in spite of the above-mentioned well-documented benefits of adjuvant systemic antibiotics, the significant adverse effects, increased bacterial resistance, and uncertain patient compliance have been emphasised, suggesting careful considerations prior to their use [ 16 49 51 52 Even though the observations made in this study appear encouraging, further investigation on a larger cohort with a longer follow-up period is very much needed to bring a more conclusive statement. The present study is limited not only by its sample size and follow-up time, but also by the study design itself. The protocol of either prescribing systemic antibiotics or delivering them locally interfered with the possibility of having a double-blinded trial. In addition, the present study was also limited to evaluating just a total bacterial count, along with only two pro-inflammatory cytokines. Targeting specific bacterial species and measuring the relative gene expression levels, with protein levels as well, of more numerous pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators would be very much needed for further confirmation or contradiction of the results of this research. 5. Conclusions Within the limitations of the present study, the adjuvant use of piperacillin + tazobactam during NSPT led to a similar reduction of PPD to the conventional use of amoxicillin and metroniazol combination six months following the completion of the initial periodontal therapy. Furthermore, other clinical parameters likewise demonstrated the comparable improvement, coupled with a lowering of the total bacterial number and relative levels of investigated cytokines.
