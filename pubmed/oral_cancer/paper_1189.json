Introduction Despite decades of preventive dentistry, dental caries remain among of the most common chronic conditions worldwide. In ecological terms, the disease reflects a shift toward acidogenic, aciduric communities on the tooth surface.

Computing Resources and Software AutoDock Vina (version 1.2.0) [ 12 13 2.2. Receptor Preparation Three-dimensional structures of the target receptors, 3AIC (local therapeutic target) and 3U2D (systemic clearance target), were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank [ 14 2.3. Ligand Preparation A library of 124 neem-derived phytochemicals was compiled from peer-reviewed sources and public repositories (e.g., PubChem, ZINC, and TCM databases). The 124 neem-derived constituents were curated from peer-reviewed phytochemistry and public databases to cover major chemotypes (limonoids, flavonoids, steroids, and terpenoids). Three-dimensional geometries were generated and energy-minimized (LigPrep, OPLS3e); protonation states at pH 7.4 ± 1.0 were assigned (Epik). Minimization employed a conjugate-gradient algorithm with a convergence tolerance of 0.001 kcal·mol −1 −1 2.4. Molecular Docking Studies AutoDock Vina was applied to evaluate binding preferences of the 124 phytochemicals against 3AIC and 3U2D. Co-crystallized ligands were re-docked to verify the protocol, targeting a heavy-atom RMSD < 2.0 Å between crystal and re-docked poses. Exhaustiveness was set to 8. AutoDock Vina settings matched screening runs (energy_range = 3, exhaustiveness = 8, num_modes = 1); for 3AIC: center (194.38, 42.40, 197.58) Å, size (40.61, 46.15, 73.81) Å; for 3U2D: center (0.46, 2.30, 24.99) Å, size (23.26, 25.99, 19.77) Å. 2.5. Binding Energy Analysis Free binding energies (ΔG) were taken from AutoDock Vina outputs and refined with MM-GBSA (Schrödinger Prime) to account for solvent and enthalpic contributions. Distributions across both receptors were summarized with box plots and histograms. Differences between receptors were assessed using paired t 15 2.6. Molecular Property Calculation and Analysis Physicochemical properties for the top-ranked compounds were computed with RDKit (e.g., molecular weight, logP, TPSA, HBD, HBA, and rotatable bonds) and compared with Lipinski’s rule of five. Scatter plots were used to contextualize drug-likeness within the screening set. 2.7. In Silico ADMET Profiling Physicochemical descriptors were computed from canonical SMILES using RDKit: molecular weight (MW), lipophilicity (logP; Crippen), topological polar surface area (TPSA), hydrogen bond donors (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), rotatable bonds, and the quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). For comparative visualization, metrics were mapped to a 0–1 “goodness” scale reflecting common medicinal chemistry heuristics. 2.8. Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering To reduce dimensionality and visualize trends, standardized descriptors and binding energies were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). The first two principal components of all variations were plotted to show chemical distribution in chemical space. In addition, chemicals were grouped with Ward’s minimal variance method using Euclidean distance by hierarchical clustering analysis based on similarities in binding properties between the two receptors [ 16 2.9. Interaction Pattern Analysis Interaction profiles of the best-performing complexes were examined with PLIP and Discovery Studio Visualizer. Hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts, π-stacking, salt bridges, and related noncovalent interactions were tabulated and summarized as residue-level heatmaps. Frequency and intensity of interactions with single residues were combined to produce heatmaps showing the most important interaction hotspots of both receptors. Representative complexes were rendered in PyMOL to illustrate key recognition features and to guide structure–activity considerations. 2.10. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were conducted in R. Data normality was examined with the Shapiro–Wilk test. Comparisons between receptors used paired t p 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Connection to Disease Context 3AIC ( Streptococcus mutans 3.2. Lead Compound Molecular Properties and Binding Affinities Molecular properties of the top 30 virtual screening compounds against dental caries targets are displayed in Figure 1 17 Notably, a number of the outlier molecules with higher molecular weights (>550 Da) possessed high Lipinski violations (>2.0), as indicated by the color gradient. While these compounds exhibited favorable docking scores, their pharmacokinetic property concern is a potential liability for clinical translation. This agrees with results reported by Cheng et al. [ 18 3.3. Multivariate Analysis of Compound Structural Features Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the molecular descriptors ( Figure 2 Figure 2 19 3.4. Receptor-Specific Binding Profiles The 3AIC ( Figure 3 Figure 4 20 Hierarchical distance between the two dendrograms is a quantitative measure of structural diversity of the binding compounds. For 3AIC ( Figure 3 Figure 4 21 3.5. Structure-Activity Relationship Analysis Correlation between the molecular property data ( Figure 1 Figure 3 Figure 4 22 Notably, compounds with dual binding affinities for 3AIC and 3U2D receptors are predominant in the low molecular weight (250–350 Da) with zero or a single Lipinski violation (<1.0). The dual targeting is a complementary approach to caries therapeutics, as it would allow modulation of local antibacterial activity and systemic clearance in a controlled fashion together. Li et al. [ 23 Further, a clear difference in preferential binding of compounds to 3AIC compared to 3U2D provides an explanation for the rational design of therapeutics with better pharmacokinetic profiles. As demonstrated by Peterson et al. [ 24 3.6. Binding Energy Profile Analysis The binding-energy analysis between the two receptor targets (3AIC and 3U2D) presented typical patterns with important implications for dental caries therapy development. As shown in Figure 5 −1 −1 p 25 Figure 5 Figure 6 −1 −1 26 27 28 We conducted statistical analysis to evaluate binding energy differences between receptors. The Shapiro–Wilk test revealed non-normal distributions for both targets, leading us to apply the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Our analysis demonstrated significantly stronger binding affinities for 3AIC (median = −8.2 kcal·mol −1 −1 p 3.7. Analysis of 3AIC and 3U2D Patterns of Interaction The interaction profiles for 3AIC ( Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 3.8. Structural Analysis of Key Binding Residues The structural model of the 3AIC binding site ( Figure 10 29 Figure 11 30 3.9. Implications for Therapeutic Development The differential patterns of binding and interaction between 3AIC and 3U2D suggest complementary pathways of developing anti-caries therapeutics. Whereas 3AIC may serve as a model target for local interventions due to its greater binding energies and well-defined patterns of interactions, 3U2D may be utilized for systemic elimination of cariogenic agents due to its broader pattern of interactions. This two-target strategy is consistent with current trends in multi-target drug design, according to Horst et al. [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 3.10. Molecular Docking and RMSD Validations The molecular docking validation was performed against the two therapeutic targets: 3AIC for local dental caries treatment and 3U2D for the systemic intervention. The results showed a superior binding performance of neem compounds against the local target 3AIC, with the docking scores ranging from −9.31 to −4.80 kcal·mol −1 Figure 12 −1 Figure 12 −1 Figure 12 Figure 12 Complementary per-receptor ADMET heatmaps ( Figure 13 2 2 Supplementary S1 Limitations and Future Directions Although encouraging, certain limitations must be mentioned. The prediction by computation is robust but must be confirmed by in vitro binding assays and crystallographic studies. Binding optimization towards both receptors and the production of analogs of the best compounds must be considered in future research. In addition to this, increased research into pharmacokinetic determinants, including the ability of such drugs to achieve therapeutically effective concentrations at the site of action, is needed. This would be provided by integrating ADME studies with binding data as available, as suggested in the system approach outlined by Thompson et al. [ 41 4. Conclusions In summary, our computational approach identified promising neem-derived candidates with potential against dental caries. Some of these compounds include D9,11-nimolinone and nimbiol. While we recognize that experimental validation remains essential, these findings provide a foundation for developing novel anti-caries therapeutics that address both local biofilm formation and systemic bacterial concerns in the future.
