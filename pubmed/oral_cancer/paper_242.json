India faces a growing burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D), placing considerable strain on affected individuals and healthcare systems. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital intervention designed to prevent T2D in individuals with pre-diabetes in India. Methods A total of 3,240 individuals with pre-diabetes will be recruited across urban and rural settings in Tamil Nadu and Delhi. Participants will be cluster randomised to either the digital intervention group or the control group (usual standard of care). Clusters will comprise of wards in urban areas and villages in rural areas. Initial screening will be conducted using the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) ≥ 30 and/or a random capillary blood glucose level ≥ 110 mg/dL. Final recruitment into the study will be based on capillary oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and/or HbA1c levels. The primary outcome is incidence of T2D at 24 months, and secondary outcomes are cardiometabolic events, lifestyle and behavioural factors, and cost effectiveness of digital interventions. The study is registered with the Central Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2022/02/040650). Discussion This protocol paper details the comprehensive study design aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a digital intervention to prevent T2D in India. If effective, the study will provide important insights into the use of technology in resource-constrained settings and offer a scalable solution for diabetes prevention. The findings could also inform future interventions and policies aimed at curbing the rising burden of diabetes in low- and middle-income countries.

By 2045, the global prevalence of diabetes is projected to reach 700 million people [ 1 2 Clinical trials have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions can prevent T2D, with benefits persisting years after the intervention ends [ 3 4 5 Although most digital interventions have been studied in high-income countries [ 6 8 9 10 11 It is therefore timely to explore whether digital technologies can be leveraged to develop acceptable, effective, scalable and sustainable population health interventions for the prevention of T2D and CVD in South Asian men and women. In our pilot study conducted with 567 participants using a mobile app intervention, significant reductions in body weight were observed in both urban (−2.40 kg, 95% CI −3.10 to −1.69; p p 12 This manuscript outlines the study protocol of the randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a digital intervention app (called My Sugar Journey) in T2D prevention compared to control (no digital intervention) among adults with prediabetes in urban and rural India. Methods/design Design This is a cluster randomised, parallel group prospective study comparing the digital intervention group (Intervention group) and control group receiving usual care (Control group). (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Flow diagram of the diabetes prevention intervention study. A 2-step screening phase is incorporated prior to study recruitment and randomisation. Outcome of T2D incidence will be determined by the specific criterion applied to each individual on admission into the study (i.e. fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose on OGTT, and/or HbA1c). * Eligibility Inclusion criteria Participants eligible for the study must be adults aged 18 to 60 years old with an Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) of 30 or higher. IDRS is a simple, cost-effective tool developed to assess the risk of developing T2D in the Indian population and is widely used in community screening programs across India. The IDRS considers various risk factors relevant to the Indian population and assigns a score based on lifestyle, family history and anthropometric measures [ 13 14 15 16 Exclusion criteria Participants will be excluded from the study if they have pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes, meet any criteria for type 2 diabetes (T2D) during screening, or are on oral hypoglycaemic agents or other medications that affect weight. Those who have undergone bariatric surgery, or plan to do so within the next 12 months, are also ineligible. Additionally, individuals who are pregnant, planning pregnancy, or unable to engage in physical activity as determined by their primary care provider, will not be included. Exclusion extends to those participating in other diabetes-related clinical trials, individuals with current or recent cancer (less than 12 months’ post-treatment), and anyone unable to participate due to other factors as assessed by the Chief Investigators. Sample size and feasibility Based on our previous findings, the expected diabetes risk reduction based on previous face to face prevention studies has been shown to be 28–32%. We hypothesized that a digital intervention would enable a 24% reduction in the incidence of T2D ( p To demonstrate that difference as significant at p Ethics approval The study has been given ethical approval for conduct in India by the Institutional Ethics Committee and registered with the Central Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2022/02/040650; registration date 28.02.2022). Each site also sought their own Institutional Ethics committee permissions from Devki Devi Foundation, New Delhi and Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai. Participant recruitment is currently ongoing. Participant screening Participants will be identified through a targeted screening process conducted by the field team. During these visits, the research team will assess potential individuals based on the study’s preliminary inclusion criteria. Prior to participating in any study-specific screening activities, potential participants will be required to sign the approved informed consent form. Eligibility will be assessed through screening evaluations, and reasons for any exclusions will be recorded in a Participant Screening Log. The study screening procedures are summarised in Fig. 1 Screening STEP 1 During the first screening visit, eligibility will be evaluated based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the IDRS score, and random capillary blood glucose [ 13 Participants meeting the criteria – defined as IDRS ≥ 30 and/or a random capillary blood glucose level ≥ 110 mg/dL – will proceed to the second stage of screening. In Asian Indians, a screening threshold of random capillary blood glucose ≥ 110 mg/dL is recommended [ 17 Screening STEP 2 In this stage, a capillary oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [ 18 19 20 Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled on to the study. For individuals with a haemoglobin less than 10 g/L, the HbA1c value will be disregarded, due to anaemia affecting glycated haemoglobin [ 21 22 Participant recruitment and cluster randomisation Participants will be cluster randomised from both urban and rural areas across Tamil Nadu and Delhi (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Summary of participant and cluster recruitment in urban and rural Chennai and Delhi. A total of 60 clusters (30 urban and 30 rural) will be recruited in Chennai, with 30 clusters (15 urban and 15 rural) in Delhi. Each cluster represents 36 participants to be recruited In Tamil Nadu, a total of 60 clusters (30 urban and 30 rural) will be established to recruit 2,160 participants (Fig. 2 Similarly, in Delhi, a total of 30 clusters (15 urban and 15 rural) will be recruited. Delhi’s urban population is organized into blocks, while the rural population is divided into clusters. The study will screen 15 urban clusters (2 or 3 blocks will be combined to form a cluster) with a population density of 29,638 and 15 rural clusters with a population density of 29,434. Both in urban and rural areas, participants will be screened till the target of 36 participants per cluster is achieved.

Individuals in the control group will receive an educational session, either via telephone or will be directed to a local healthcare clinic. Standard educational materials will be provided on lifestyle risk factors of T2D and recommendations on a healthy diet and physical activity in accordance with international and national recommendations. For participants assigned to the digital intervention group, the research team will conduct home visits to administer study questionnaires, assist with downloading the digital intervention app, and complete the onboarding process. During this visit, participants will receive a brief overview of the app’s functionality and features. After the 6-month intervention period, participants will continue to have access to the digital app on their phones and may use it at their discretion. However, no further active engagement will be provided, such as notifications, nudges, or telephone calls. Participants are free to interact with the app’s features as they wish. Digital intervention development and description The digital app, My Sugar Journey (Fig. 3 12  Fig. 3 The digital intervention app, My Sugar Journey In the beta testing phase, a total of 25 individuals from diverse backgrounds tested the app. The group included scientists, doctors, managers, diabetes educators, app developers, freelancers, illustrators and home makers, as well as some people with diabetes. This varied tester profile allowed us to gather valuable feedback from different professional perspectives, which was instrumental in fine-tuning the app for a wide range of users. The app is available in three languages: English, Hindi and Tamil. The software is implemented as a mobile phone application and is available for download within research settings from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store for Android and iPhone users, respectively. Once the recruited participant downloads the MSJ application, the study team sends a study code to register and use the app. The main functionalities of the MSJ app include: (i) browsing lifestyle and behavioural suggestions, including nutrition and meal planning through recipes (ii) an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled chat-bot helping participants to navigate through various lifestyle sections (iii) gamification with each gaming level providing lifestyle and behavioural advice (iv) self-monitoring of selected behaviours (step-count, physical activity and food tracking, as well as weight tracking), (v) getting prompts and summary feedback for habit formation through push-notifications, and (vi) a brief quiz based on the content given in the app to enhance engagement. Lifestyle goals of the intervention are to improve diet, increase physical activity, reduce sedentary behaviour, reduce excess body weight, improve sleep, reduce stress, cease (or at least decrease) smoking, and moderate alcohol consumption. The targets for diet and lifestyle are based on the American Diabetes Association recommendations [ 23 Participants enrolled in the digital intervention arm receive once monthly telephone calls for the 6 months intervention (a maximum of 6 telephone calls in total), only if there is no engagement with the app over any particular month. App engagement will be monitored based on app usage from the backend data team. During the telephone call, participants are simply asked if any technical issues and gently prompted to use the app. The anticipated duration of the telephone call is approximately 1–2 min. From our pilot data conducted during the Covid-19 period [ 12 Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcome is incidence of T2D at 24 months (as determined by the specific criterion applied to each individual on their admission into the study (fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose on OGTT, and/or HbA1c). For example, if an individual’s prediabetes status was defined by HbA1c value (within the range 42-47mmol/mol), their progression to type 2 diabetes will be defined by the associated HbA1c threshold (48mmol/mol or greater). Changes over 6 and 12 months are considered secondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes are listed in Table 1 1 Qualitative outcomes Between 6 and 12 months into the study, focus group discussions will be conducted with up to 15 participants from both urban and rural areas of Chennai and Delhi. Interviewees will be selected through purposive sampling, aiming for variation across geographical area, socioeconomic background and areas of high and low uptake. The aim is to explore the challenges and barriers associated with using digital interventions for lifestyle behaviour modification among individuals living in South Asia. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted using pre-designed guides by trained interviewers. Statistics and data analysis The primary analyses will be based on an intention to treat (ITT) principle. All participants who are randomised into the study will be included in the ITT analysis and the analysis is conducted according to the randomised treatment arm. Outcomes will be assessed for normal distribution. For the primary outcome, the incidence of T2D in each study arm will be determined based on the participants’ entry criterion. Change in HbA1c, fasting glucose, or 2-hour OGTT glucose values will be calculated from baseline to endpoint (at 12 months and 24months) and reported based on the specific criterion applied to each individual on their admission into the study. Outcomes will be assessed by two-tailed unpaired t-test if normally distributed or the Wilcoxon Rank sum test if non-normally distributed. Discussion This study is the largest study to assess the effectiveness of a digital app intervention for the prevention of T2D in India to date. The adoption of digital tools for health behaviour modification offers a scalable and potentially cost-effective approach, particularly in settings with limited healthcare resources. However, realising their full potential, requires addressing several challenges. A key challenge is the variation in digital literacy and varying levels of access to smartphone technology, particularly in rural populations. Rural India has experienced rapid internet adoption, driven by the surge in online services such as digital payments, e-learning, and telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. With more than 821 million users, rural India has more internet users than urban India [ 24 25 Identifying and reaching individuals at high risk can be challenging, particularly in rural areas [ 26 27 Another key factor in determining the success of the intervention is user adherence and engagement with the app. The study intervention offers a personalised approach to enhance individual engagement through gamification and motivation strategies, such as challenges, rewards, and progress tracking. By offering a more interactive experience, the app encourages sustained participation and adherence to healthy lifestyle changes, which are necessary for T2D prevention [ 23 Finally, due to the high prevalence of anaemia in the South Asian population, which can affect HbA1c readings and lead to inaccurate assessments of diabetes risk [ 21 22 28 In conclusion, despite the challenges, the use of a digital platform reduces the need for extensive physical infrastructure and human resources, offering a scalable solution that could be highly cost-effective in resource-constrained environments. If proven successful, the study has the potential to contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting digital health solutions for diabetes prevention, with broader implications for public health policy and healthcare delivery in resource-constrained settings.
