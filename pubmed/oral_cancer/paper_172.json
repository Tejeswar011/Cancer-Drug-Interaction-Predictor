Biopsies are processed at one of the company's three US-based laboratories (Irving, TX; Phoenix, AZ; Boston, MA) and examined by subspecialty-trained gastrointestinal pathologists using standardized procedures and diagnostic criteria. A detailed explanation of the pathologic examination protocols has been described previously ( 9 10 12 14 24 We constructed a database from 701,620 first esophageal biopsies, successfully geocoded 694,626 (99.0%) to United States census tracts, and linked census demographic information to histopathology findings. We geocoded the address data using R (Version 4.1.1, sf package 1.0–16) and linked this to the most recent American Communities Survey (every five years) at the time of biopsy at a census tract-level based on patient residential address. Among the geocoded participants we included 250,401 with biopsies from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 to match the timeframe of exposure data, and limited to 246,950 within the continental United States, including the District of Columbia. We excluded those with missing exposure estimates (2.2%) for any of the five years before case or control definition to yield 241,459 included participants. Case and control populations EoE cases were defined as patients with ≥15 eosinophils per high-power field (eos/hpf; 400× magnification with 22 mm oculars; hpf area of 0.237 mm 2 1 9 10 12 14 24 Air pollutant exposure metrics The National Emissions Inventory (NEI) ( https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories/national-emissions-inventory-nei Statistical analyses We described, using mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables and number and percent for categorical variables, the distribution of individual- and census tract-level demographic characteristics, and pollutant emissions of the cases, controls, and overall population. We performed tabular analysis of differences between cases and control. We performed mixed effects logistic regression with nested random effects for census tract areas within counties for the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). ORs were reported per additional ton emitted per year. To address possible collinearity in census tract characteristics as adjustment variables, the variables were simplified using principal components analysis. The population density was always included in adjusted estimates, as were sex and age, and then principal components were added by stepwise forward selection with a retention threshold of p Geographical visualization For EoE case control status the kernel density using a bivariate normal distribution was estimated to use roughly 100-by-100-mile areas, with the density categorized into deciles. These methods were used to show patterns in case-control status without identifying individual geographical information.
