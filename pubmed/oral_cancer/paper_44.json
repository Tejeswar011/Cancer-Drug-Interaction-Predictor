In recent years,\nexosomes have emerged as promising agents for precise intervention\nand functional regeneration, owing to their properties of active targeting,\ncargo delivery capability, modifiability, and biocompatibility, particularly\nwhen used in conjunction with engineering and biomaterial delivery\nstrategies. While the therapeutic potential of exosomes in the management\nof musculoskeletal diseases is increasingly acknowledged, the current\nliterature lacks a comprehensive integration of three critical dimensions:\nexosome engineering strategies, advanced biomaterial delivery systems,\nand their prospective therapeutic applications across various diseases.\nTherefore, this study concentrates on engineering methodologies aimed\nat augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes, encompassing the\npretreatment of blast cells, the modification of exosomes, and their\nincorporation with biomaterials. Furthermore, we systematically introduce\ndelivery systems utilizing hydrogels, scaffolds, microneedles, and\nfiber membranes, which enhance exosome delivery by facilitating spatial\npositioning control and achieving sustained release effects. Building\non this foundation, we conduct an in-depth examination of the mechanisms\nand applications of exosomes in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.\nAdditionally, this review provides the analysis of biogenesis, isolation,\nextraction, and preservation strategies of exosomes while also identifying\nthe key factors impeding their clinical application. Based on this\nsynthesis, we propose that exosomes represent a transformative paradigm\nfor targeted, minimally invasive, and tissue-specific interventions\nin musculoskeletal medicine. exosomes cargo loading modified strategies biomaterials delivery systems tissue engineering musculoskeletal disorders targeted therapy Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality 10.13039/501100005089 7232129 Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province NA 2023B1111050003 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes document-id-old-9 nn5c05416 document-id-new-14 nn5c05416 production-flag-MathML-config-version 3 production-flag-journal-citation-display-style acs-titles production-flag-journal-date-display-style dates-used-rcd-rvd-acc document-id-alt-64 c1056999f5f50dc586c743e8f8eb6f0a158b1749befeee7798b760937853171b As the structural foundation of the human body, the skeletal system\nplays a vital role not only in maintaining morphology and providing\nmechanical support but also in orchestrating essential physiological\nfunctions such as hematopoiesis, organ protection, and mechano-sensing.   However, a wide spectrum of skeletal disorders, including\ntraumatic\nbone defects, osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and\nspinal cord injuries (SCI)significantly compromises mobility\nand quality of life, especially in aging populations.     Amid these limitations, exosomesmembrane-bound extracellular\nvesicles (30–150 nm)have emerged as a powerful platform\nfor therapeutic delivery. Exosomes facilitate intercellular communication\nby transporting functional nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites.\nTheir inherent biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and capacity\nfor selective tissue targeting make them highly attractive for orthopedic\napplications. In preclinical studies, exosomes derived from mesenchymal\nstem cells (MSCs) and other cell types have demonstrated robust regenerative\npotential in bone, cartilage, tendon, and spinal tissues. To tackle this intricate and multifaceted\nchallenge, a range of\nengineering strategies have been devised. These strategies encompass\nthe pretreatment of exosome-derived cells, the regulation of culture\nconditions, the internal cargo loading, and external surface modification\nof exosomes, all of which have significantly enhanced batch uniformity\nand therapeutic targeting. Concurrently, the integration of various\nbiological materials and the development of hydrogels, scaffolds,\nand other delivery systems have further optimized delivery efficiency,\nextended the activity cycle, and facilitated large-scale production.   While exosome therapy has\ndemonstrated considerable potential in\nthe musculoskeletal domain, the current body of literature reveals\nsignificant gaps. Notably, there is a deficiency in engineering strategies\nand a systematic framework for biomaterial delivery systems. Furthermore,\nthe principles of disease adaptation remain inadequately defined,\nimpeding the systematic development of exosome engineering strategies\nand biomaterial carriers tailored to the diverse pathological characteristics\nof orthopedic diseases. In response to these challenges, this thesis\ninnovatively establishes a trinity framework of “engineering-material\ndelivery-disease orientation”. This is achieved by analyzing\nthe molecular basis of exosome biogenesis and therapeutic potential,\nintegrating engineering strategies with delivery platforms to construct\ncoherent interaction mechanisms, and examining the latest preclinical\nresearch on prevalent orthopedic conditions such as osteoarthritis,\ntraumatic bone defects, rheumatoid arthritis, and spinal cord injury.\nFinally, the disease-specific treatment matrix was established, and\nthe decision tree for “engineered exosome-biological integration”\nwas developed based on the characteristics of the pathological microenvironment.\nThis framework addresses a theoretical gap in system integration within\nthe field and offers a pathology-driven design blueprint to advance\nthe translation of laboratory-derived exosomes into clinical-grade\napplications for precision regenerative medicine in musculoskeletal\ndisorders. Overview of Exosomes Exosomes, small EVs (30–150\nnm), are crucial in intercellular\ncommunication and increasingly significant in diagnostics, therapeutics,\nand regenerative medicine.  History: From Discovery to Functional Insights The\njourney of exosomes began in the mid-20th century with a broader study\nof EVs. However, it was not until the 1980s that exosomes were specifically\nidentified, following observations that maturing reticulocytes released\nsmall vesicles, later termed “exosomes”.   As research advanced into the 2000s, the significance of exosomes\nin various physiological processes became evident. They were found\nto be integral to immune responses, neuronal communication, and tissue\nrepair.   Over the last two decades,\ntechnological innovations have led to\nremarkable developments in exosome research. Enhanced isolation and\ncharacterization techniques, including ultracentrifugation, nanoparticle\ntracking analysis (NTA), and high-resolution imaging, have enabled\nresearchers to explore exosomes in unprecedented detail. Not only\nhave these technologies advanced our knowledge of exosome biology,\nbut they have also facilitated their use as biomarkers and natural\ntransporters for drug delivery, gene therapy, and RNA-based treatments.  Biogenesis: A Complex and Regulated Process The biogenesis\nof exosomes is a highly regulated and multistep complex process that\nplays a crucial role in exosomal biosynthesis, intercellular communication,\nand the maintenance of cellular homeostasis ( Figure  1 Biogenesis\nand structure of exosomes. Exosome biogenesis relies on key molecular players\nlike Rab proteins,\nSyntenin-1, TSG101, ALIX, ESCRT proteins, and tetraspanins, which\nguide their formation, sorting, and release.  Extraction: Isolation and Preservation Techniques Isolation Technology of Exsomes To advance the application\nof exosome research in clinical settings, it is imperative to address\nthe challenges of scalability, standardization, and the preservation\nof functional activity in isolation techniques.  Emerging technologies characterized by\nhigh specificity are catalyzing a transformational shift in separation\nparadigms. Immunoaffinity capture, which is predicated on the principle\nof antigen–antibody specific binding, employs antibodies targeting\nexosome surface marker proteins to facilitate targeted enrichment\nvia solid-phase carriers. This approach underpins the development\nof precision medicine. Nonetheless, the substantial cost associated\nwith antibodies presents a significant impediment to widespread adoption.

Through the application of tangential flow filtration technology,\nthe Exodisc device effectively combines centrifugation and nanofiltration\nmodules, thereby enhancing the efficiency of urine treatment. Additionally,\nthe innovative ultrathin silicon nitride membrane technology facilitates\ncontinuous production with minimal pressure drop, which directly contributes\nto reducing the structural costs associated with CAR-exosomes and\nother therapeutic products. Furthermore, the ExoSearch chip establishes\na “capture-detection” closed-loop analysis paradigm.\nMeanwhile, the iKnife factory employs artificial intelligence to dynamically\noptimize process parameters, setting a new industry standard by minimizing\nproduction volatility.  Preservation Methods for Exosomes Preserving exosomes\nis vital for their research and practical use, as it directly impacts\ntheir stability, functionality, and reliability of experimental outcomes.\nOne of the primary considerations in exosome preservation is storage\nconditions, which can significantly affect their size, number, contents,\nand biological activities. Research indicates that storing biofluids\nand isolated exosomes at −80 °C is optimal for preserving\ntheir integrity over long durations. Short-term storage at 4 °C\nis also possible, but it is not recommended for long durations due\nto potential alterations in exosome properties. Transformation: From Functions to Applications in Biomedicine Applications of Exosomes in Biomedicine The unique\nbiophysical properties of exosomes underpin their roles in health\nand disease. They exhibit a characteristic size and morphology, with\na “saucer-like” appearance under electron microscopy\nand a buoyant density in sucrose gradients between 1.13 and 1.19 g/mL.\nThe stability and functionality of their lipid and protein composition,\nrich in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine (PS), and proteins\nlike tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, and CD81), enable their role in long-range\nintercellular communication, highlighting their involvement in diverse\nbiological processes and potential clinical applications.    Exosomes hold significant\npromise for both diagnosis and therapy. Their molecular cargo, indicative\nof the originating cells’ physiological state, makes them ideal\nnoninvasive disease biomarkers. Exosomes extracted from bodily fluids\nsuch as blood, urine, and saliva offer crucial insights into disease\nconditions, facilitating liquid biopsies and early detection. Exosomes\nare being investigated as natural delivery vehicles in therapy because\nthey can encapsulate and protect therapeutic agents.   Exosomes have emerged as multifaceted entities\nwith the potential\nto transform biomedicine. They are valuable for both fundamental research\nand clinical applications due to their importance in intercellular\ncommunication, diagnostics, and therapeutics. As our knowledge of\nthese nanovesicles increases, the potential for exosomes to revolutionize\nhealthcare continues to grow, heralding a new era of precision medicine\nand innovative treatment strategies. Challenges in the Clinical Application of Exosomes As natural nanoscale delivery vectors, the clinical translation of\nexosomes remains constrained by fundamental challenges inherent in\ntheir biological characteristics. A primary obstacle is cargo heterogeneity,\nwhich impedes the consistency of therapeutic outcomes.  The advancement of large-scale production technology for functional\nexosomes remains insufficient to meet clinical demands, posing a significant\nbarrier to their transition from laboratory research to clinical application.  In the future, the challenges associated with the clinical\napplication\nof exosomes may be progressively addressed through advancements in\ntechnology. Precision separation techniques have the potential to\nresolve issues related to cargo heterogeneity, while modifications\nto reduce immunogenicity could enhance safety profiles. Furthermore,\nbreakthroughs in large-scale production and storage technologies are\nanticipated to facilitate standardized preparation. As these obstacles\nare overcome, exosomes are poised to assume a more significant role\nin clinical practice. Strategies of Exosomes in the Management of Orthopedic Diseases Exosomes, as an emerging therapeutic modality in regenerative medicine,\ndemonstrate significant promise in tissue repair, attributed to their\nlow immunogenicity, efficient intercellular communication capabilities,\nand diverse biological effects. Nonetheless, the treatment of orthopedic\ndiseases poses distinct challenges due to the intricate microenvironment\nand restricted regenerative capacity of these tissues. Nanoscale exosomes\nexhibit potential in facilitating the repair of complex degenerative\nalterations in bone and cartilage through various approaches, including\ntheir native form, modified configurations, or integration with biomaterials  Native Exosomes Load Cargo and Promote Tissue Repair Exosomes originating from cells like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),  Native Exosomes Regulate Cartilage Repair In treating\ncartilage damage, exosomes have shown significant potential as therapeutic\nagents. Exosomes from chondrocytes and MSCs are essential for regulating\nthe chondrogenic environment. These exosomes can enhance the proliferation\nof chondrocytes while simultaneously reducing inflammation, a dual\naction necessary for maintaining and regenerating cartilage tissue,.  Native Exosomes Repair Bone Defects Native exosomes\npossess the capability to accurately target the bone microenvironment\nby utilizing their intrinsic cargo of protein signaling molecules,\nincluding bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)-related proteins and\nintegrins, as well as regulatory nucleic acids, such as bone-promoting\nmicroRNAs.  Zhang et al. verified that\nBMSC-Exos effectively activate critical osteogenic signaling pathways\nthrough the incorporation of BMP-2. As a highly effective osteogenic\ninducer, BMP-2 interacts with its specific cell membrane receptor,\ninitiating the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. The phosphorylated Smad\nproteins subsequently form a complex with Co-Smad4 and translocate\ninto the nucleus, where they synergistically activate the principal\nosteogenic transcription factor RUNX2. This activation leads to the\nupregulation of osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin (OPN), and other target\ngenes. Consequently, this process directly promotes the differentiation\nof mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts and facilitates the mineralization\nof the bone matrix, thereby effectuating bone repair. Furthermore, native\nexosomes have the capability to deliver specific\nsignaling molecules that precisely modulate the recruitment, polarization,\nand functional state of immune cells, including macrophages and T\ncells. This modulation transforms a pro-inflammatory injury microenvironment\ninto a pro-regenerative repair environment, thereby establishing favorable\nconditions for bone repair. Wang et al. demonstrated that M2-derived\nexosomes influence macrophage polarization by activating the PI3K/AKT\nsignaling pathway, which enhances the bone immune microenvironment\nand facilitates the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal\nstem cells (BMSCs), ultimately expediting bone healing. M2-derived\nexosomes, containing active components such as mRNA, can be internalized\nby M1 macrophages, leading to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway\nand inducing the conversion of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to\nthe anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. M2 macrophages subsequently secrete\nanti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), and osteogenic\nfactors, including bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and oncostatin\nM (OSM), which collectively inhibit the inflammatory environment and\npromote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Exosomes Enhance Tissue Repair by Promoting Angiogenesis Angiogenesis refers to the process of forming new blood vessels from\nthe existing blood vessel network, which plays an important role in\ntissue repair as it supplies essential nutrients and oxygen to healing\ntissues.  Special Functions Given by Engineering The field has\nadvanced into creating modified exosomes, offering an innovative method\nto boost the therapeutic efficacy of these vesicles ( Figure 2 Processing strategies\nof engineered exosomes and forms of integration\nwith materials. Pretreatment of Blast Cells: Source-Regulated Secretory Behavior By pretreating progenitor cells responsible for exosome secretion,\nwe can optimize the functional attributes of the resultant exosomes\nin a source-specific manner. This optimization is primarily achieved\nthrough the modulation of the biological state or molecular expression\nprofile of the progenitor cells. Genetic modification of these cells\nvia gene transfection technology enables the continuous secretion\nof exosomes with predetermined targeting capabilities. Moreover, the characteristics of exosomes\ncan be substantially altered through precise regulation of the culture\nenvironment and conditions during the production by cells. For instance,\nmodifications in medium composition, such as the type and concentration\nof serum, the addition of specific growth factors or small molecule\ncompounds, and adjustments to the physical parameters of the cell\nculture, including oxygen tension, fluid shear stress, or matrix stiffness,\ncan have significant effects. Han et al. demonstrated that three-dimensional\n(3D) culture significantly enhanced the efficacy of mesenchymal stem\ncell-derived exosomes (3D-EXOs) in spinal cord repair. Exosomes derived\nfrom 3D culture were enriched with neuroprotective proteins and immunomodulatory\nmicroRNAs, maintaining cell stemness as evidenced by a 3.89-fold increase\nin SOX2 expression compared to a two-dimensional (2D) culture. Additionally,\nthe average particle size of 60 nm was more favorable for cellular\nuptake.  The capacity to directionally modify the\nbiological characteristics\nof exosomes by altering their “birth environment” offers\na crucial strategic foundation for acquiring exosomes with specific\nfunctions or targets. This significantly enhances their potential\napplications in disease diagnosis, treatment, and regenerative medicine. Internal Modification: Efficient Loading of Therapeutic Cargo Loading exosomes with therapeutic molecules further expands their\nutility.  To efficiently load therapeutic molecules into the inner cavity\nof exosomes, active loading techniques are essential. The choice of\nthe loading strategy varies according to the nature of the therapeutic\ncargo. For nucleic acid analogues such as siRNA or mRNA, electroporation\nis commonly employed. This technique transiently disrupts the exosome\nmembrane using specific electrical parameters, facilitating the efficient\nimport of these molecules.  Furthermore, the dependence on energy–substance\ninteractions\ncan significantly improve the delivery efficiency. In a study conducted\nby Kim et al., a multifunctional composite carrier, termed NV-IONP,\nwas developed by integrating iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) with\nexosome-like nanovesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells (NV).\nThe superparamagnetic properties of the IONP encapsulated within the\nNV-IONP facilitated the generation of a directional magnetic force\nwhen subjected to an external magnetic field. This mechanism effectively\nmitigated the entrapment of nanovesicles in the lungs and liver following\nsystemic injection, thereby enhancing the accumulation of nanovesicles\nat the site of spinal cord injury by a factor of 10 compared to the\ncontrol group. External Modification: Precise Targeting and Functional Enhancement Surface engineering of exosome membranes can endow them with the\ncapability to actively recognize and target specific tissues or cells,\nthereby enhancing their functional efficacy.   You et al. modified exosomes with dextran\nsulfate (DS) due to its specific affinity for the macrophage receptor\n(SR-A), which is abundantly expressed in the inflamed joints of individuals\nwith rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The covalent attachment of DS to the\nsurface of adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)-derived exosomes (DS-Exos)\nwas achieved through metabolic glucose engineering in conjunction\nwith copper-free click chemistry. This modification improved the targeting\ncapability of the exosomes and increased their accumulation in arthritic\njoints in vivo by a factor of 1.52. N d The primary objective\nof these external modifications is to address\nthe limitations associated with the inherent tropism of exosomes,\nthereby significantly enhancing the efficiency and specificity of\ntheir delivery of therapeutic cargo to the targeted lesion site or\ncell. Biomaterials-Mediated Delivery and Enhanced Function Biomaterials employed as carriers for exosome delivery are selected\nbased on distinct loading and release mechanisms. These biomaterials\ncan be broadly categorized into natural polymers, synthetic polymers,\ninorganic materials, and stimuli-responsive materials. And these biomaterials\nare engineered into specific physical forms to create delivery systems,\nwith their structural design critically impacting the loading, protection,\nrelease kinetics, and interaction of exosomes with target tissues. Integration of Different Biomaterials with Exosomes Natural Polymers Natural polymeric materials, sourced\nfrom living organisms, exhibit notable advantages, such as excellent\nbiocompatibility, biodegradability, and low toxicity. Exemplary materials\nwithin this category include gelatin, chitosan, sodium alginate, and\nhyaluronic acid. These materials are typically characterized by high\nporosity, hydrophilic surfaces, low compressive modulus, and enzyme-sensitive\ndegradation with degradation periods spanning from days to weeks.\nSuch properties facilitate a high-capacity physical embedding environment\nfor exosomes and govern the sustained release behavior through mechanisms\nsuch as hydrogen bonding or electrostatic adsorption, thereby significantly\nmitigating the burst release phenomenon. Nevertheless, the inherent low mechanical\nstrength of natural materials poses a risk of structural failure and\natypical exosome release when applied to weight-bearing bone defects.\nConcurrently, the rapid enzymatic degradation occurring within an\ninflammatory microenvironment may result in premature exposure and\nsubsequent proteolytic degradation of exosomes, thereby constraining\ntheir effectiveness in orthopedic applications involving weight-bearing\nand inflammatory conditions. Synthetic Polymers Synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene\nglycol, polylactic acid, polyacetate copolymers, and polycaprolactone,\nexhibit a stable molecular architecture and consistent properties,\nalongside superior mechanical characteristics when compared to natural\nmaterials. The remarkable characteristics of these materials encompass\nthe precise engineering of the network aperture and a broad spectrum\nof adjustable degradation cycles, facilitating more versatile functional\nmodifications. In the context of treating orthopedic diseases with\nexosomes, synthetic materials frequently exhibit limitations, including\nsuboptimal biocompatibility, inadequate degradation congruence, and\na propensity to induce localized inflammatory responses. Inorganic Biomaterials The function of inorganic biomaterials\nis to serve as rigid scaffolds for bone conduction. Notable examples\nof such materials include hydroxyapatite and titanium alloys.  l Nonetheless, the inherent brittleness\nof these materials may result in particle shedding when applied to\ndynamic load-bearing bone regions. This shedding could lead to the\nunintended migration of encapsulated exosomes to nontarget tissues,\npresenting a significant risk in orthopedic environments subjected\nto dynamic loading. Intelligent Responsive Materials The fundamental principle\nof intelligent responsive materials lies in their ability to interpret\npathological signals, thereby facilitating precise spatiotemporal\nrelease. Notable examples of such materials include thermosensitive\nsubstances, enzyme-responsive gels, and photothermal materials. These\nmaterials are engineered to respond to specific stimulus, such as\ntemperature fluctuations, particular enzyme concentrations, or near-infrared\nlight, to initiate exosome release as needed.  This innovative design encounters two primary challenges:\nfirst, the intricate synthesis process frequently results in a substantial\nreduction of exosome activity; second, the in vivo pathological signal\ngradient, including the concentration of specific enzymes, may be\ninadequate to achieve a predetermined response threshold. These limitations\nsignificantly hinder its practical effectiveness in the treatment\nof orthopedic conditions necessitating precise delivery, such as bone\ninfections or bone tumors. Intrinsic Properties of the Material Significantly Influencing\nthe Therapeutic Efficacy of Exosomes The intrinsic physical\ncharacteristics of biomaterials, notably porosity, stiffness, and\ndegradation rate, serve as critical design parameters that significantly\ninfluence their loading efficiency, release kinetics, and overall\nbiological performance at the target site when they are employed as\nexosome carriers. Porosity Porosity plays a critical role in modulating\nthe diffusion pathways of exosomes and the interface of cell contact\nby influencing the microstructural characteristics of the material.\nWhile a structure characterized by high porosity and large pore size\nfacilitates the efficient loading of exosomes, as well as the infiltration\nand migration of cells, it may also induce an initial burst release\neffect, leading to the premature depletion of active molecules. Conversely,\nstructures with dense or small pore sizes considerably restrict the\ndiffusion rate, resulting in a slow and sustained release pattern.\nThis is particularly advantageous for tissue repair processes that\nnecessitate prolonged regulation, such as nerve or osteochondral regeneration.\nAn optimal range of porosity not only enhances the spatiotemporal\ndistribution of exosomes but also establishes a conducive physical\nmicroenvironment for effective paracrine signal transmission between\nexosomes and target cells.  In the domain\nof exosome therapy for orthopedic disorders, porosity is a fundamental\ndeterminant influencing osseointegration and angiogenesis. An optimal\nbone repair scaffold necessitates a highly interconnected and suitably\nsized porous architecture. This structure not only facilitates the\ninfiltration of host osteoblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and\nMSCs but also provides an extensive surface area and space for the\naccommodation of exosomes. Nevertheless, the design of pores requires\nmeticulous calibration: excessively large or open pores may result\nin the premature loss of exosomes during the initial phase of implantation,\npotentially compromising their capacity to sustain an effective concentration\nwithin the bone defect. Conversely, appropriately small or nanoscale\npores can retard the release of exosomes, aligning with their long-term\nrole in promoting osteogenic differentiation, angiogenesis, and immune\nmodulation. Stiffness The stiffness of materials, characterized\nby their elastic modulus, indirectly influences the efficacy of exosomes\nprimarily through mechanotransduction signals. Cells exhibit a high\nsensitivity to substrate stiffness, and materials that closely replicate\nthe physiological stiffness of the target tissue can more effectively\nfacilitate cellular adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and differentiation.\nAdditionally, such materials can modulate the exosome secretion profile\nof both the loaded cells and infiltrating host cells. In the field of orthopedics, the stiffness\nof materials plays a crucial role in replicating the mechanical microenvironment\nof the target bone tissue.  Degradation Rate The degradation rate is a pivotal\nfactor influencing both the carrier lifetime and the timing of exosome\nrelease. This degradation process is characterized by the dynamic\nevolution of the pore structure, specific surface area, and local\nmicroenvironment. These alterations not only continuously modulate\nthe diffusion and release of exosomes but also impact the stability\nof exosomes and the efficiency of cellular interactions. The kinetics\nof material degradation are intricately linked to exosome release\nbehavior: materials undergoing bulk dissolution or hydrolysis typically\nexhibit rapid degradation, leading to a short-term, substantial release\nof exosomes, whereas slow degradation facilitates a prolonged and\nsustained release profile. For biomaterials\nintended for bone repair, it is crucial that the degradation rate\nis precisely synchronized with the rate of new bone formation. If\ndegradation occurs too rapidly, it may result in the premature collapse\nof the scaffold, thereby compromising mechanical support and disrupting\nthe continuous supply of exosomes, which are essential for the maturation\nand mineralization of the callus.  In conclusion, porosity, stiffness, and degradation rate do\nnot\nfunction independently; rather, they interact synergistically to influence\nthe loading, release, and stability of exosomes within biomaterial\ncarriers as well as their interaction efficiency with the cellular\nand tissue microenvironment. A comprehensive understanding and precise\nregulation of these fundamental physical parameters are crucial strategies\nfor achieving spatiotemporally controlled delivery of exosomes, thereby\nmaximizing their therapeutic potential, particularly in the domains\nof regenerative medicine, immune regulation, and precision medicine. Construction of Biomaterial Delivery Systems to Deliver Exosomes Hydrogel Systems Hydrogel systems, characterized by\na highly aqueous three-dimensional network structure, offer excellent\nbiocompatibility and a gentle encapsulation environment for exosomes.  Wu\net al. focused on optimizing the fundamental physical characteristics,\nincluding the pore structure and mechanical properties, of alginate\nhydrogel to enhance the release profile and functional behavior of\nexosomes (Treg-Exo) and SDF-1α. The objective was to achieve\ncontrolled release and minimize peripheral loss. Scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) analysis revealed that the hydrogel exhibited an\ninterconnected porous architecture, which facilitated the storage\nof exosomes and SDF-1α and ensured their uniform distribution.\nFurthermore, the release kinetics were modulated through the diffusion\nwithin the pore network, enabling a sustained release of both agents.\nAdditionally, the hydrogel demonstrated an appropriate storage modulus\n( G G Scaffold Systems The scaffold system typically comprises\nsynthetic polymers, such as polylactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer\nand polycaprolactone, as well as inorganic materials such as hydroxyapatite\nand titanium alloys. These scaffolds are engineered into a three-dimensional\nconfiguration with specific pore structures and geometries using techniques\nsuch as 3D printing, thermally induced phase separation, or sintering.   Kyung Kim et al. employed freeze-drying to create silk fibroin (SF)\nscaffolds, which were then coated with exosomes from human adipose\nmesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs). Silk fibroin (SF), derived from Bombyx mori G G Microneedle Systems Microneedle (MN) systems, particularly\nsoluble microneedle arrays composed of materials such as gelatin,\nhyaluronic acid, or polylactic- co Li et al. successfully encapsulated Exo and polydopamine nanoparticles\n(PDA NPs) within the tip of a microneedle patch. This innovative approach\neffectively circumvented the discomfort associated with gastrointestinal\ndigestion and the administration of oral drugs via injection, thus\nenhancing patient medication adherence. The PDA NPs, characterized\nby their reducing functional groups such as catechol and imine, were\nstrategically encapsulated within an outer layer of HAMA shell. The\nbiomaterial configuration enabled spatiotemporally controlled release\nof PDA NPs, which effectively attenuated ROS-mediated inflammation.\nBesides, the study’s findings demonstrated that PDA@Exo not\nonly promoted osteogenesis but also regulated cartilage metabolism\nand modulated macrophage polarization. Fiber Membrane Systems In fiber membrane systems, both\nnatural polymers, such as gelatin and chitosan, and synthetic polymers,\nsuch as polycaprolactone and polylactic acid- co Zha et al. constructed a coaxial electrospinning nanofiber membrane\nwith polylactic acid (PLA) as a hydrophobic core and chitosan (CS)\nas a hydrophilic shell by coaxial electrospinning technology. PLA\ncan provide mechanical support, and CS can provide rich modification\nsites. As a biomimetic extracellular matrix, the fiber membrane not\nonly has a high loading capacity and controlled release characteristics\nbut also can stably bind exosomes to avoid their diffusion, thereby\nimproving local retention efficiency. At the same time, its nanofiber\nstructure can provide a large cell contact area, which is conducive\nto nutrient transport and cell adhesion and proliferation. Moreover,\nthe mechanical matching and wettability optimization between CS and\nPLA enhance the biocompatibility, which can cooperate with the high\ntransfection efficiency of exosomes to continuously release the VEGF\ngene, thereby effectively promoting vascularization and osteogenesis. In summary, the engineering strategy\nof exosomes and their delivery\nsystems should be meticulously aligned with the pathological characteristics\nand anatomical requirements of the target orthopedic conditions. It\nis essential to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of various\nsystems concerning drug loading capacity, release controllability,\nmechanical properties, biocompatibility, and clinical application\nconvenience in order to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes.\nFurthermore, the profound synergy between engineered exosomes and\nbiomaterial-based delivery systems offers innovative solutions to\nsurmount the delivery challenges specific to orthopedic diseases through\nmultilevel functional integration and spatiotemporal coupling mechanisms. Application of Exosomes in Orthopedic Diseases Orthopedic\ndiseases present distinct challenges to therapeutic\nstrategies owing to their intricate microenvironment and restricted\ncapacity for tissue regeneration. Nanoscale exosomes, particularly\nwhen modified or utilized as biomaterials, have demonstrated potential\nin augmenting repair mechanisms related to complex degenerative conditions\nimpacting bone and cartilage. It is important to acknowledge that\nthe strategies for applying and designing exosomes exhibit significant\nspecificity depending on the disease context. In the case of\ntraumatic bone injury, the primary objective is\nto expedite the repair and regeneration of bone defects. This involves\nstrategies that focus on selecting or engineering exosome sources\nenriched with potent pro-angiogenic and osteogenic differentiation\nfactors and precisely targeting these exosomes to the injury site\nusing optimized delivery systems to enhance new bone formation and\nvascularization. Conversely, in osteoarthritis, the emphasis shifts\ntoward cartilage protection, inflammation inhibition, and degeneration\ndelay. The design approach frequently involves utilizing exosomes\nderived from specific cells, which are either naturally enriched or\nengineered to contain anti-inflammatory factors and molecules related\nto cartilage matrix synthesis. This aims to modulate the inflammatory\nmicroenvironment within the joint cavity and promote chondrocyte anabolism.\nIn the context of rheumatoid arthritis, a systemic autoimmune disorder,\nthe central strategy revolves around immune regulation and inhibition\nof synovial hyperplasia. The design of exosomes typically prioritizes\ntheir immunomodulatory properties, which may originate from regulatory\nimmune cells or be engineered to express immunosuppressive molecules\nat high levels. The objective is to target hyperactive immune cells\nand synovial fibroblasts, inhibit their abnormal activation and the\nrelease of proinflammatory factors, and restore immune homeostasis.\nIn the context of spinal cord injury, the challenge is the complex\nenvironment associated with nerve regeneration disorders. The primary\nstrategy involves crossing the blood-spinal cord barrier and inhibiting\nglial scar formation. The design approach often involves selecting\nexosomes with neurotrophic properties, axonal growth promotion, and\nantiapoptotic capabilities. These exosomes are frequently combined\nwith biological material scaffolds or subjected to physical and chemical\nmodifications to enhance their penetration and retention time in the\ninjured core area, with the aim of creating a microenvironment conducive\nto nerve axon regeneration and functional recovery. Consequently,\nthe selection of exosome sources, content engineering,\nand optimization of delivery methods must be meticulously aligned\nwith the pathological mechanisms and therapeutic end points of specific\ndiseases ( Table 2 Comparative Design Framework for Exosome-Based\nTherapies in Skeletal Disorders disease type core pathological\nfeatures engineering\nstrategies delivery\nsystems key case studies & innovations references traumatic bone defect vascular injury •targeting: integrin peptides for bone homing porous scaffolds (HA/Ti alloy) metabolic engineering + click chemistry-modified bone-targeting peptides → 150% ↑ bone accumulation    inflammatory imbalance •functional enhancement: co-loading VEGF + BMP-2 for angiogenic-osteogenic coupling self-healing hydrogels    large-scale defects •immunomodulation: M2-Exos to suppress inflammation    osteoarthritis\n(OA) cartilage degradation •targeting: CAP peptides for cartilage penetration thermosensitive hydrogels CRISPR/Cas9 delivery of FGF18 gene + chondrocyte targeting → synergistic gene\nediting and lubrication    chronic synovitis •anticatabolism: siRNA silencing MMP13 microneedle arrays    penetration barriers •metabolic regulation: ECM synthesis promotion    rheumatoid\narthritis (RA) autoimmune\nattack •immune tolerance: IL-10/TGF-β delivery for M2 polarization systemic administration MMP-responsive PEG-cP exosomes → 152% ↑ accumulation in inflamed joints    synovial hyperplasia •smart response: MMP-activatable PEG deshielding local fibrin hydrogels    Th17/Treg imbalance •combo therapy: immunosuppressant loading    spinal\ncord injury (SCI) neuroinflammation •anti-inflammatory repair: M2-Exos for microglial polarization conductive hydrogels conductive hydrogel integrated M2-Exos → activates Ca 2+    glial scar •gene regulation: PTEN-silencing siRNA for axonal growth intranasal delivery    axonal regeneration failure •barrier repair: endothelial targeting    Traumatic Bone Defect Selection Principle and Design Idea of Exosomes Traumatic\nbone defects are frequently associated with localized vascular damage,\ndisruption of the inflammatory microenvironment, and discontinuity\nof the bone matrix.

To\noptimize the targeting and efficacy of exosomes in relation\nto the specific characteristics of the pathological microenvironment\nof traumatic defects, further modifications are necessary. For instance,\nsurface modification with integrin peptides can enhance the homing\ncapability of exosomes to bone defect sites, while chemical modifications\ncan improve their stability in inflammatory environments. Throughout\nthe modification process, it is crucial to adhere to core principles\nthat preserve the structural integrity of the exosome membrane and\nmaintain the functionality of bioactive molecules, thereby preventing\nany loss of biological activity due to excessive modification. Furthermore,\nthe design of biomaterials and delivery systems should aim to achieve\nsynergistic effects. Biomaterials should exhibit excellent biocompatibility\nand osteoconductivity, exemplified by composite materials such as\nhydroxyapatite and collagen, which mimic the structure of the natural\nbone matrix and function as scaffolds for bone regeneration ( Figure 3 Mechanisms of engineered\nexosomes employed in treating traumatic\nbone defects, including pretreated precursor cells, Loading Cargo to Promote Bone Regeneration and Inhibit Inflammation In order to promote cell regeneration and tissue repair, BMSC-derived\nexosomes (BMSC-Exos) enhance osteogenesis in various fracture models,\nwith miRNA and lncRNA within the exosomes playing a crucial role.  miR-467/HoxA10  In addition, for the requirement of vascular repair in traumatic\nbone defects, exosomes should carry nucleic acids that regulate angiogenesis.\nChen et al. administered TREMD-Exos encapsulated miR-142–3p\nat the fracture site, which were effectively internalized by both\nbone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical\nvein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Microcomputed tomography (micro-CT)\nanalysis revealed an approximate 40% enhancement in callus volume\n(BV/TV) and a significant increase in bone mineral density (BMD).\nFurthermore, CD31 immunohistochemistry and laser speckle contrast\nimaging (LSCI) demonstrated a 1.9-fold augmentation in vascular density\nwithin the fracture region. the Angpt1/Tie2-NO Modified Exosomes Increased Therapeutic Efficacy Enhancements\nin the extraction method and pretreatment of blast cells have substantially\nincreased the production and targeted delivery efficiency of functional\nexosomes, which means increasing their “quantity”. Zhong\net al. employed the continuous extrusion technique for the preparation\nof exosomes, which not only effectively regulated the size of the\nexosomes to enhance their uniformity but also significantly increased\nthe yield. The exosome analogues produced via this method exhibit\nproperties and functions comparable to those of exosomes extracted\nby using traditional methods. However, the yield is 10-fold greater,\ndemonstrating a clear advantage over conventional extraction techniques. 3 4 Once adequate therapeutic doses are achieved, the subsequent crucial\nchallenge involves ensuring efficient and specific enrichment of these\nexosomes within the target lesion area. Following systemic administration,\nexosomes frequently encounter obstacles such as nonspecific distribution,\nrapid clearance, and inadequate penetration within the complex pathological\nmicroenvironment. These issues lead to a significantly lower effective\ndose at the bone defect site than anticipated. Consequently, the active\nengineering of exosomes to target the microenvironment or specific\ncells associated with bone defects has become an essential strategy\nto enhance their therapeutic efficacy. Chen et al. investigated the\nmodification of functional components in secreted exosomes (3D-Exos)\nthrough the three-dimensional culturing of human adipose-derived stem\ncells (hADSCs) to form tissue-like spheres. This process induced transcriptomic\nreprogramming, activating skeletal developmental pathways such as\nRas/Wnt and downregulating cell-cycle genes. As a result, 3D-Exo exhibited\na distinct miRNA profile, characterized by the significant upregulation\nof 12 miRNAs associated with bone formation, including miR-3648, and\nthe downregulation of inhibitory miRNAs such as let-7i-5p and miR-29b-3p.\nThis reprogramming enhanced the affinity of exosomes for bone tissue.\nIn vivo distribution experiments demonstrated that the accumulation\nof 3D-Exo in bone tissues, including limb bones and the spine, was\nmarkedly higher than in the liver and other organs. Furthermore, the\npeak fluorescence intensity of 3D-Exo in skull defects was 4.5 times\ngreater than that of exosomes derived from traditional two-dimensional\ncultures (2D-Exo). Engineered\nexosome technology is dedicated not only to enhancing\n“quantity” but also to fundamentally improving “quality”.\nThis qualitative enhancement encompasses two critical dimensions.\nFirst, it substantially mitigates the potential toxicity risk associated\nwith exosomes, thereby enhancing the safety of clinical applications.\nIn a study by Li et al., liposome-mediated BMP2 gene transfection\nwas applied to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), allowing the\ntransfected cells themselves to bear the liposome-induced cytotoxicity\nas the “factory”. Consequently, the secreted exosomes\n(MSC-BMP2-Exo) exhibited no biological toxicity, as evidenced by a\ncell survival rate exceeding 95% in the CCK-8 assay. Furthermore,\nBMP2 gene transfection resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in BMP2 mRNA\nexpression in hMSCs and significantly facilitated bone regeneration\nby activating the BMP2/Smad signaling pathway. Another critical facet of “quality improvement”\ninvolves\nendowing exosomes with the intrinsic capability to navigate and address\ncomplex pathological environments. This enhancement enables them to\nprecisely target multiple interconnected tissues or pathological pathways\nsimultaneously, thereby eliciting a synergistic reparative effect.\nThis advancement is particularly crucial in the intricate context\nof traumatic bone defects, which involve multiple tissue injuries\nand regeneration disorders. The pivotal “quality” leap\nlies in employing engineering strategies to design multifunctional\nexosomes capable of facilitating vascular-bone coupling repair or\nneural-vascular-bone coupling regeneration. Such advancements aim\nto achieve more comprehensive and efficient tissue regeneration. In\na study by Lian et al., adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs)\nwere pretreated with nerve growth factors (NGF) for 48 h to induce\nthe secretion of functional exosomes (N-Exos). NGF significantly reprogrammed\nthe exosomal miRNA expression profile of ADMSCs by activating the\nTrkA receptor and initiating the intracellular MAPK/PI3K-Akt signaling\npathway. This resulted in the upregulation of 12 key miRNAs, including\nmiR-195-5p, let-7a-5p, and miR-29b-3p, by more than 2-fold. Upon delivery\nof these enriched miRNAs to target cells via N-Exos, a robust multitissue\nsynergistic repair capability was observed. At the neural level, N-Exos\nsignificantly enhanced Schwann cell migration and stimulated a 1.8-\nto 2.3-fold increase in the secretion of neurotrophins BDNF and NT-3.\nConcurrently, N-Exos markedly enhanced the axonal outgrowth of dorsal\nroot ganglion (DRG) neurons, which was associated with a 4.1-fold\nupregulation in the expression of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related\npeptide (CGRP). In terms of vascular development, the density of CD31 + Material Integration Expands the Clinical Application of Exosomes Higher Targeting Ability and Controlled Release Behavior Using exosomes directly to treat bone defects faces challenges like\ntransient release and excessively high concentrations in circulation.\nMany studies have attempted to integrate exosomes with other biomaterials\ninto composites to achieve targeting delivery and controlled release\nof exosomes.  Building on the inherent properties of hyaluronic acid (HA)\nsuch as excellent biocompatibility, ease of modification, and hydrogel\nformation, Chen et al. further modified HA into HA-ADH and OHA-Q to\nenhance its antibacterial and hemostatic capabilities. The incorporation\nof stromal-cell-derived factor 1-alpha (SDF-1α) and exosomes\nfrom M2 macrophages with the modified HA hydrogel demonstrated significant\nefficacy in repairing traumatic bone defects. The hydrogel’s\nporous architecture facilitates efficient substance exchange and exosome\nrelease, while the positively charged modified quaternary ammonium\ngroup effectively inhibits bacterial proliferation. Moreover, this\nquaternary ammonium group enhances platelet aggregation, and the hydrogel’s\nhigh swelling rate allows for rapid absorption of blood, thereby promoting\nhemostasis. Subsequent experiments revealed 40% and 60% increases\nin bone volume fraction (BV/TV) at 14 and 21 days, respectively, compared\nto the control group, alongside a reduction in fracture gap and enhanced\nangiogenesis. Regarding antibacterial efficacy, the hydrogel at a\n4% concentration achieved a clearance rate exceeding 95% against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia\ncoli Synergistic Repair of Vascular and Muscular Tissues Li et al. isolated derivatives containing miR-21-5p from exosomes\nof ADSCs that had been preconditioned under hypoxic conditions. Following\nencapsulation in GelMA, the exosome derivative was demonstrated to\nspecifically target SPRY1 in hUVECs, thereby activating the PI3K/AKT co Jin et al. designed\na polycaprolactone (PCL)-based asymmetric bilayer scaffold to treat\nmuscle injuries associated with bone defects. The oriented fiber layer\nguides myofibroblast orientation and myogenic differentiation, while\nthe random fiber layer promotes BMSC differentiation. The scaffold\nwas positively charged via surface chemical modification with PEI,\nenabling it to bind BMSC-Exos to exert angiogenic and immunomodulatory\neffects. Composition Simulation and Mechanical Support Several\nstudies have combined exosomes with bioceramics, metals, and ECM to\nform composite materials.  Smad Metal materials, characterized by their\nhigh elastic modulus and mechanical strength, offer immediate and\nstable mechanical support for bone defects, particularly in load-bearing\nregions. They effectively resist movement-induced loads and prevent\ncollapse of the defect area. Furthermore, their inherent corrosion\nresistance and long-term biocompatibility contribute to structural\nstability and, when subjected to surface modification, enhance osseointegration\ncapabilities. Kang et al. used Mg 2+ 2+ Exosomes,\nfunctioning as natural agents of intercellular communication,\nhave shown considerable promise in the repair of bones. However, their\nuse in clinical settings is limited by issues such as temporary release\nand increased systemic levels. By incorporating exosomes with both\nnatural and synthetic polymers along with other biomaterials such\nas bioceramics, metals, and ECM components, researchers can achieve\ncontrolled and sustained exosome release, targeted delivery, and modulation\nof the local microenvironment, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes.\nNatural polymers, such as HA and SF, offer excellent biocompatibility\nand biodegradability, facilitating the effective delivery of exosomes\nwhile promoting bone healing. Similarly, synthetic polymers such as\nGelMA and PLGA provide greater control over mechanical properties\nand degradation rates, so the exosomes can be released in a regulated\nmanner and the stability of the drug they carry is stabilized. When\ncombined with bioceramics and metals, such as hydroxyapatite or titanium\nalloy, these composite materials not only support bone regeneration\nbut also enhance angiogenesis and immune modulation, which are key\nfactors in the success of bone repair. Osteoarthritis Selection Principle and Design Idea of Exosomes OA,\nthe prevalent type of arthritis, is marked by joint pain and functional\nimpairment. The pathological environment of OA is characterized by\na dynamic imbalance affecting the entire joint organ. Chondrocytes\nexhibit a reduced number, functional decline, diminished synthesis\ncapacity, and accelerated senescence and apoptosis. This results in\nsignificant degradation of the extracellular matrix, particularly\ncollagen II and proteoglycans, such as aggrecan, along with abnormally\nelevated activities of matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanases.\nConcurrently, chronic low-grade inflammation pervades the joint cavity,\nwith synovial tissue becoming activated to release proinflammatory\nfactors. Damaged chondrocytes also contribute to the inflammatory\ncycle, perpetuating a deleterious process termed “inflammatory\nsenescence”. The subchondral bone undergoes abnormal remodeling,\nevidenced by sclerosis of the bone plate, destruction of the trabecular\nstructure, microfractures, and cystic degeneration. This is accompanied\nby aberrant blood vessels and nerves infiltrating from the bone end\ninto the degenerative cartilage area, exacerbating cartilage destruction. Exosomes can directly influence damaged\nchondrocytes by sending signals that encourage their growth and survival,\nprevent cell death, boost the production of essential matrix components,\nand effectively suppress the activity of enzymes that degrade the\nmatrix, such as MMPs and ADAMTS, in an attempt to counteract catabolic\nprocesses.  Figure 4 Illustrating the pathological alterations associated\nwith osteoarthritis  sn Regulating the Inflammatory Environment and Promoting Cartilage\nRepair Exosomes exhibit therapeutic effects on OA through\nprotecting cartilage and alleviating inflammation. MSC-Exos have the\ncapacity to attenuate inflammation and facilitate osteochondral regeneration\nby modulating the balance between M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes\nand decreasing the levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and\ntumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) at the lesion site, thereby\nreducing the site of injury. MSC IPFP IPFP Improving Matrix Degradation and Maintaining a Metabolic Environment Inhibiting the degradation of the extracellular matrix and preserving\na conducive metabolic environment for chondrocytes are effective strategies\nfor safeguarding the integrity of the cartilage matrix and mitigating\nor preventing its erosion and thinning. Zhang et al. revealed that\nexosomal CD73 present in MSC-Exos activates adenosine, subsequently\ninfluencing the AKT EPK AKT/ERK/AMPK Cartilage Targeting Increased to Improve the Effective Concentration The rapid clearance of nonspecific exosomes from the joint cavity\nis facilitated by synovial fluid dynamics and the activity of synovial\nphagocytes. Furthermore, the avascular and alymphatic nature of cartilage,\ncoupled with its dense extracellular matrix, acts as a formidable\nbarrier to exosome penetration. Consequently, the effective accumulation\nof natural exosomes in cartilage lesions is challenging, necessitating\nthe development of engineered strategies to enhance the targeting\ncapabilities. Yan et al. chose Sortase A to conjugate exosomes\nwith chondrocyte affinity peptide (CAP) and subsequently anchored\ncholesterol-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting MMP13\nto the exosome membrane through membrane insertion. sn Repairing Physiological Structures and Cooperating to Repair\nSubchondral Bone OA is a degenerative condition that affects\nthe entire joint. Abnormalities in the subchondral bone may precede\nor coincide with degeneration of cartilage. The subchondral bone and\ncartilage together form a functional unit, necessitating a bidirectional\nand synergistic approach to repair in order to restore the structural\nand mechanical integrity of the bone-cartilage interface. JBMSC-Exos\ndemonstrate chondroprotective capacity through phenotype maintenance\n(via type II collagen promotion) and antisenescence/apoptosis effects\n(against IL-1β stimulation) in vitro, with lncRNA MEG-3 serving\nas a key functional component. Further animal experiments confirm\ntheir therapeutic potential in OA by attenuating cartilage lesions\nand abnormal subchondral bone changes. Exosomes, especially\nthose from MSCs and specialized sources, offer a promising strategy\nfor OA treatment ( Table 4 Application of Exosomes and Engineered\nExosomes in OA treated disease year exosome source modification signaling pathway/molecule in vitro in vivo animal model ref osteoarthritis 2024 IPFP-MSCs Exos were obtained after IPFP-MSCs pretreated with TNF-α PI3K/AKT pathway TNF-α precondition\nenhances the EVs secretion of IPFP-MSCs exosomes obtained\nfollowing TNF-α pretreatment\ncan ameliorate OA pathological\nchanges and improve gait abnormalities medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA mouse model     synthesizing articular HA-based hydrogel microspheres containing chondrocyte-targeting hybrid exosomes (CAP/FGF18-hyEXO) PI3K/AKT pathway CAP/FGF18-hyEXO@HMs promote proliferation, migration, and ECM synthesis of OA chondrocytes CAP/FGF18-hyEXO@HMs effectively alleviate OA progression ACLT-induced OA\nrat model    Expi293F cells the\nexosome surface was\nmodified with CAP via lipid insertion and then loaded internally with\nsiRNA against MMP13.

For example, preconditioning exosomes\nwith specific cytokines such as TNF-α or fucoidan can enhance\ntheir anti-inflammatory properties and support ECM preservation. When\nintegrated with advanced biomaterial-based delivery platforms, including\nhydrogel-based scaffolds, 3D-printed bioinks, and nanocarrier systems,\nexosomes are poised to significantly improve outcomes in OA treatment,\nparticularly for patients who cannot benefit from traditional surgical\ninterventions such as joint replacements. The growing body of evidence\nsupporting exosome-based therapies underscores their potential to\nnot only alleviate symptoms of OA but also promote genuine tissue\nrepair and regeneration. However, challenges remain in optimizing\nexosome production, refining delivery methods, and ensuring safety\nand efficacy in clinical practice. Moving forward, careful evaluation\nthrough clinical trials is necessary to fully assess the impact of\nexosomes on the OA progression and joint function. Ultimately, exosomes\ncould represent a groundbreaking shift in how OA is treated, offering\nmore personalized, less invasive, and effective options for patients. Rheumatoid Arthritis Selection Principle and Design Idea of Exosomes RA\nis a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by bilateral synovial\ninflammation and progressive cartilage/bone erosion, predominantly\nmanifesting as the polyarticular involvement of peripheral joints.\nThe pathological milieu of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized\nby chronic inflammation and aberrant proliferation of synovial tissue,\nresulting in the formation of a destructive pannus alongside significant\ndysregulation of the immune system. This dysregulation is evidenced\nby an imbalance in T cell subsets, notably the excessive activation\nof proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells, coupled with insufficient activity\nof regulatory T (Treg) cells, which possess suppressive functions.\nConcurrently, B cells are hyperactivated, leading to the production\nof autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated\nprotein antibody (ACPA), and the subsequent formation of immune complexes.\nFurthermore, synovial fibroblasts (FLS) exhibit abnormal activation.\nCollectively, these factors perpetuate inflammatory responses, angiogenesis,\ncartilage degradation, and bone erosion.  Figure 5 Pathological\nalterations in rheumatoid arthritis and the therapeutic\napplication of exosomes in its management.  Inhibition of Inflammatory Cells and the Expression of Pro-inflammatory\nFactors Owing to the distinct pathological characteristics\nof rheumatoid arthritis, the management of synovitis and inflammation\nhas emerged as a crucial aspect in the therapeutic approach to this\ncondition. Yan et al. developed ADMSC-derived exosomes loaded with\nicariin (ADSCs-exo-ICA). This formulation enhanced the water solubility\nand bioavailability of ICA, inhibited the proliferation of M1-type\nmacrophages by specifically targeting activated macrophages within\nsynovial tissue, and reduced glycolysis through the suppression of\nthe ERK/HIF-1α/GLUT1 Restoring the Homeostatic Equilibrium between Th17 and Treg\nCells The Th17/Treg balance serves as a central component\nof immune homeostasis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and its dysregulation\nis a fundamental driving force behind joint destruction. By precisely\nrestoring this balance, exosomes have the potential to ameliorate\nthe disruption of immune homeostasis and the progressive exacerbation\nof inflammation. Wu et al. designated the M2Exo@CuS-CitP-Rapa (M2CPR),\nserving as a delivery vehicle for ultrafine copper sulfide nanoparticles\n(CuS NPs), peptide multiepitope autoantigen (CitP), and rapamycin\n(Rapa). This nanocomposite targets RA-inflamed tissues, releasing\nCuS NPs, CitP, Rapa, and anti-inflammatory factors. CuS NPs induce\ncuproptosis in activated T cells, whose remnants are phagocytosed\nby macrophages, leading to TGF-β secretion. TGF-β and\nRapa synergistically convert iDCs into tDCs. tDCs present CitP to\nnaive T cells, promoting their differentiation into Tregs. Tregs produce\nTGF-β, perpetuating tDC differentiation and establishing a self-sustaining\nimmune tolerance cycle for robust and enduring antigen-specific immune\ntolerance. Inhibiting the Overactivation of B Cells and the Excessive Production\nof Antibodies The hyperactivation of B cells and the resultant\noverproduction of autoantibodies are contributing factors to joint\ndestruction and the chronic nature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Elucidating precise\ntherapeutic mechanisms and ensuring safety and efficacy consistency\nare critical for clinical implementation. Nevertheless, advancing\nexosome platforms represents a transformative step in RA management,\noffering targeted, personalized, and minimally invasive alternatives\nto conventional treatments. Continued research may establish exosomes\nas a cornerstone of future RA care, reducing inflammation, promoting\ntissue repair, and improving the patient’s quality of life. Spinal Cord Injury Selection Principle and Design Idea of Exosomes SCI\nis recognized as a major medical challenge, often leading to severe\nneurological impairments, including motor and sensory dysfunction.\nThe distinctive pathological milieu associated with spinal cord injury\n(SCI) is initiated by a primary insult and swiftly progresses into\na multifaceted cascade comprising several stages. Initially, the acute\nphase is characterized by disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier,\nhemorrhage, and ischemia, resulting from vascular rupture. This phase\nis succeeded by a pronounced inflammatory response and excitotoxicity.\nSubsequently, there is demyelination attributable to ongoing neuronal\napoptosis and necrosis, axonal degeneration, and oligodendrocyte demise.\nIn the chronic phase, the formation of a glial scar and the establishment\nof an inhibitory microenvironment significantly impede nerve regeneration\nand axonal remyelination. Exosomes facilitate the delivery of\nbioactive molecules that mitigate the early inflammatory response\nby modulating the polarization of microglia and macrophages toward\nan anti-inflammatory phenotype, while concurrently inhibiting the\nrelease of pro-inflammatory factors. Additionally, exosomes contribute\nto the reduction of apoptosis and necrosis by safeguarding neurons\nand oligodendrocytes. When integrated with biomaterials, exosomes\nfurther enhance angiogenesis and restore the integrity of the blood-spinal\ncord barrier, thereby ameliorating the local ischemic microenvironment.\nMoreover, they inhibit the excessive activation of astrocytes and\nthe formation of glial scars. Ultimately, exosomes promote axonal\ngrowth and remyelination by providing neurotrophic support. In summary,\nexosomes are engineered to impede the progression of secondary injury,\nprotect residual neural tissue, and ultimately establish a microenvironment\nconducive to neural repair and functional recovery  Figure 6 Exosomes aid\nin spinal cord injury treatment by promoting nerve\nregeneration,  Regulation of Inflammation and Protection of Nerve Cells Following SCI, it is imperative that treatment be administered promptly\nto mitigate the progression of tissue damage, which includes the regulation\nof inflammation and the reduction of neuronal apoptosis. Immune cell\ninflux into spinal cord tissue is driven by dysregulated microglial\nresponses and blood-spinal barrier disruption. These cells secrete\nproinflammatory or immunomodulatory factors, eliciting inflammatory\nresponses that exacerbate neuronal and axonal damage and impede the\nrepair process. Consequently, it is imperative to modulate the polarization\nof microglia and macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype\nand to suppress the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in order\nto mitigate the acute inflammatory response during the initial phase. Xiong et al. demonstrated that regulatory\nT cell-derived exosomes (Treg-Exos) contain miR-709, which specifically\ntargets the NKAP gene to attenuate microglial pyroptosis and dampen\nneuroinflammation following SCI. miR-124–3p/MYH9 Improvement of the Local Microenvironment of the Injury Inflammation triggered by SCI releases ROS. MAPK-NFκB P65 Regeneration and Remyelination of Punctured Axons Damage\nleads to the disruption of axonal integrity; therefore, the restoration\nof spinal cord function necessitates the regeneration of axonal extensions\nby neurons. Zhang et al. designed a dual BSP with two ends that can\nspecifically bind to collagen and exosomes, respectively. They anchored\npaclitaxel-encapsulated exosomes derived from human umbilical cord\nmesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) into the collagen scaffold via BSP.\nThe composite scaffold can recruit NSCs and enhance nerve regeneration. PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR + Newly developed axons exhibit considerable\nfragility and are prone to growth arrest or degeneration as a result\nof the inhibitory microenvironment present in the injured region.\nPrompt remyelination offers essential physical protection and metabolic\nsupport, thereby facilitating axonal stabilization and maturation.\nOligodendrocytes are essential for myelination and axonal functional\nrecovery. He et al. demonstrated that MSC-Exos rich in VGF promote\noligodendrocyte development. Consequently, they developed a fibrin\ngel incorporated with MSC-Exos to enhance recovery from SCI. Physiological Structural Repair of the Blood-Spinal Cord Barrier The primary objective, whether it involves promoting regeneration\nor regulating the microenvironment, is to reconstruct the fundamental\nphysiological defense mechanism of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB).\nThe integrity of the BSCB is essential for maintaining spinal cord\nhomeostasis. It serves a dual function: it acts as a barrier by strictly\nregulating the transendothelial transport of substances, thereby insulating\nagainst peripheral inflammatory factors and toxic agents, and it also\nprovides a stable metabolic and signal transduction environment for\nneurons and glial cells. Kong et al. observed that miR-2861\nin Treg-Exos maintains the integrity of the BSCB by inhibiting IRAK1. + + miR-501-5p/MLCK JAK1/STAT3 NF-κB Restoration of the Physiological Function of Spinal Cord Conduction Building upon the successful reconstruction of the critical physiological\narchitecture of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), exosome therapy\nfurther facilitates the repair of spinal cord injuries, ultimately\naiming at functional recovery. This recovery is characterized by the\nrestoration of efficient nerve signal transmission and the maintenance\nof electrophysiological homeostasis. Conductive hydrogels, which align\nwith the electrical and mechanical characteristics of neural tissue,\nare promising candidates for SCI repair and the reconstitution of\nelectrophysiological functions. Guan et al. developed conductive hydrogels\n(TP) incorporating M2 microglial exosomes (M2-ExOs) to synergistically\nenhance electrical signaling postspinal cord injury (SCI). The conductive\nmatrix is composed of tannic acid-cross-linked polypyrrole (PPy),\nwhich possesses conductivity compatible with spinal cord tissue and\nfacilitates sustained release of M2-ExOs through reversible hydrogen\nbonding. The TP components activated voltage-gated calcium channels,\nelevated intracellular Ca 2+ NF-κB In summary,\nSCI is a severe condition causing profound motor and sensory dysfunction,\nsignificantly impairing the quality of life. Exosomes have shown great\npotential in mitigating secondary damage after SCI by regulating oxidative\nstress, inflammation, and apoptosis. They also support neuroregeneration,\naxonal growth, and remyelination and promote angiogenesis, effectively\ncreating a more conducive environment for spinal cord recovery. Specifically,\nexosomes can deliver GFs, miRNAs, and other therapeutic molecules\nto modulate the immune response, enhance vascularization, and replenish\nthe ECM, thus facilitating tissue repair. Moreover, combining exosomes\nwith advanced materials, such as conductive hydrogels, MN arrays,\nand gradient peptide-modified scaffolds, has further enhanced their\ntherapeutic effects in SCI repair. These innovative carriers not only\nenable targeted delivery to the injury site but also provide structural\nsupport and allow for sustained release of exosomes, amplifying their\nhealing potential ( Table 6 Application of Exosomes and Engineered\nExosomes in Spinal Cord Injury treated disease year exosome source modification signaling pathway/molecule in vitro in vivo animal model ref spinal\ncord injury 2024 M2 microglia Exos were isolated and reversibly\nbonded to electroconductive hydrogels via hydrogen bonding PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway TPME facilitated\nthe M2\npolarization of BV2 cells and enhanced axonal outgrowth in NSCs local injections of hydrogel-encapsulated PRP-Exos increased tight junction protein expression, reduced inflammation,\nand enhanced neural recovery rat spinal cord transection\nmodel    platelet-rich plasma Exos were embedded in PEG/ODEX hydrogel NF-κB signaling\npathway PRP-Exos enhance tight junction integrity by significantly\nreducing bEnd.3\ncell permeability under hypoxic-hypoglycemic conditions hypoxia-Exo preserves NP structure and components,\nthus improving IVDD SCI mice model   2023 EGFR + MiR-34a-5p was enriched in exosomes MiR-34a-5p/HDAC6 pathway EGFR + EGFR + spinal\ncord injured mice    pericyte Exos carried miR-210 MiR-210/JAK1/STAT3 axis Exosomes enhance endothelial\ncell barrier integrity Exosomes promote the recovery\nof motor function and protect the BSCB SCI mice model    Treg cells Exos carried miR-2861 MiR-2861 exosomes promoted the expression\nof tight junction protein in bEND.

These naturally occurring\nnanovesicles are poised to revolutionize the way we approach musculoskeletal\ninjuries, degenerative bone diseases, and tissue repair. By enhancing\ncommunication between cells, exosomes carry a diverse array of bioactive\nmolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which are\ncrucial for regulating cellular functions, such as differentiation,\nproliferation, and apoptosis. Their intrinsic ability to modulate\nbiological pathways, particularly in bone regeneration, cartilage\nrepair, and tendon healing, has garnered significant attention from\nresearchers and clinicians alike. The therapeutic potential\nof exosomes is particularly evident in\nthe treatment of dense connective tissue injuries and degenerative\ndisorders such as OA, OP, and fractures. Derived primarily from MSCs,\nexosomes can mimic the regenerative abilities of their parent cells,\nproviding a highly efficient, noninvasive option compared to conventional\ntreatments. These vesicles exhibit low immunogenicity, noncytotoxicity,\nand an exceptional ability to deliver bioactive molecules with high\nspecificity to target tissues, making them attractive candidates for\nregenerative medicine. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that\nexosomes can promote tissue repair, enhance cellular regeneration,\nand support the restoration of function in damaged bone, cartilage,\nand tendon tissues. Their potential to address complex, age-related\nmusculoskeletal disorders marks exosomes as a transformative advancement\nin orthopedic therapeutics. However, despite their vast potential,\nthe clinical application\nof exosome-based therapies faces several significant hurdles. Chief\namong these is the isolation and purification of exosomes from complex\nbiological fluids, such as blood, synovial fluid, and bone marrow.\nCurrent isolation methods, such as ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion\nchromatography, and immunoaffinity-based techniques, are often labor-intensive\nand time-consuming and yield preparations that are heterogeneous in\nnature. This lack of consistency in the quantity and quality of exosomes\nisolated from different biological sources not only complicates the\nstandardization of exosome-based therapies but also limits their reproducibility\nand therapeutic efficacy. Addressing these challenges requires the\ndevelopment of optimized, scalable methods for exosome isolation along\nwith the establishment of standardized protocols to ensure consistent\ntherapeutic outcomes across clinical settings. Another major\nchallenge lies in the variability of experimental\nprotocols, including animal models, exosome sources, and administration\nmethods. While preclinical studies have provided compelling evidence\nof exosome-mediated regeneration, the lack of uniformity in outcome\nmeasurements and reporting hinders the ability to draw definitive\nconclusions and translate these findings into clinical practice. The\nneed for large-scale, well-controlled studies, particularly those\nconducted in large animal models, is paramount to validating the safety,\nefficacy, and long-term impact of exosome-based treatments in humans.\nStandardizing outcome measures and ensuring the reproducibility of\nresults across studies are crucial steps in the process of moving\nexosome-based therapies from the laboratory to clinical application. Furthermore, while exosome-based therapies hold promise in orthopedic\nregenerative medicine, the complexity of exosome biology presents\nadditional challenges. A deeper understanding of the precise mechanisms\nthrough which exosomes exert their effectssuch as their interactions\nwith specific receptors on target cells and their modulation of signaling\npathwayswill be critical for optimizing their therapeutic\nuse. Advances in exosome engineering, such as the incorporation of\nspecific bioactive molecules, genetic modifications, or surface modifications\nto enhance targeting and delivery, are ongoing. However, the integration\nof these engineered exosomes into biomaterial scaffolds or hydrogels\nfor controlled localized release remains an area requiring further\nresearch. Additionally, developing safe and efficient delivery systems,\nwhether through direct injection, incorporation into implants, or\nsystemic administration, will be crucial for optimizing exosome-based\ntherapies. Regulatory challenges must also be addressed as exosome-based\ntherapeutics\nmove toward clinical trials. Regulatory agencies such as the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) must establish clear guidelines\nfor the approval of exosome-based therapies, ensuring that they meet\nthe rigorous safety, efficacy, and manufacturing standards required\nfor clinical use. The commercialization of exosome-based products\nwill depend not only on their scientific validation but also on the\ndevelopment of reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective manufacturing\nprocesses. To better apply exosomes to clinical practice, it\nis necessary\nto work together in various fields. Researchers must prioritize the\ndevelopment of robust, standardized, and validated methodologies for\nthe isolation, characterization, and quantification of exosomes. A\ncomprehensive mechanistic understanding of exosome function within\nspecific musculoskeletal contexts, including receptor interactions\nand the modulation of signaling pathways, is essential. Furthermore,\na rigorous evaluation of the potential biological risks associated\nwith both native and engineered exosomes is of paramount importance.\nThis includes a systematic assessment of unintended immune activation,\ntumorigenicityparticularly concerning exosomes derived from\nimmortalized cellsand off-target effects due to nonspecific\nbiodistribution in relevant preclinical models. Clinicians play a\ncritical role in translating preclinical findings by designing and\nparticipating in well-controlled clinical trials. Emphasis should\nbe placed on studies utilizing large animal models and subsequent\nhuman trials to robustly establish safety, efficacy, optimal dosing,\nand long-term outcomes. Defining clinically relevant end points and\nmeticulously monitoring for potential adverse effects in patients\nwill be essential. For the successful commercialization of exosome-based\ntechnologies, substantial investment from the industry is essential\nto develop cost-effective processes that comply with Good Manufacturing\nPractice (GMP) standards for production, engineering, and quality\ncontrol. Collaboration with academic institutions and regulatory bodies\nis imperative to establish rigorous standards. Innovation in delivery\nplatforms, such as the integration of exosomes into biomaterial scaffolds\nor hydrogels for controlled release, requires extensive development\nefforts. The intrinsic biological complexity of exosomes, further\ncomplicated by engineering strategies designed to enhance functionality\nor specificity, demands a steadfast commitment to safety assessments\nthroughout the development pipeline. Potential risks identified during\npreclinical studies must be carefully monitored during clinical trials.\nRegulatory agencies are required to provide clear and practical frameworks\nfor the evaluation of these novel therapeutics, necessitating comprehensive\ndata on safety and efficacy. In conclusion, exosomes represent\none of the most exciting frontiers\nin the fields of regenerative medicine and orthopedic therapeutics.\nTheir ability to modulate cellular processes, promote tissue regeneration,\nand deliver bioactive molecules with remarkable specificity holds\npromise for transforming the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases.\nWhile significant strides have been made in understanding the potential\nof exosomes, numerous challenges remain before they can be widely\nimplemented in clinical practice. These include the optimization of\nisolation and purification techniques, the standardization of experimental\nprotocols, the refinement of delivery strategies, and the establishment\nof regulatory frameworks. As the field of exosome research continues\nto evolve, it is imperative that these challenges be addressed with\na multidisciplinary approach that combines advances in biomaterials,\nnanotechnology, and clinical medicine. With continued research and\ncollaboration, engineered exosomes could soon become a cornerstone\nof orthopedic regenerative therapies, offering personalized, targeted,\nand minimally invasive treatment options for patients suffering from\ndegenerative bone diseases and musculoskeletal injuries.
