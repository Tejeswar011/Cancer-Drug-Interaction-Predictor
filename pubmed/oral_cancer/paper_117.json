Objective This article reviews the latest updates and outcomes of kidney-sparing surgery (KSS) in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Methods A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed and Embase databases to identify related English-language studies published within the last 10 years. Key search words included “upper urinary tract tumour/cancer/carcinoma”, “kidney-sparing surgery or approach”, “endoscopic treatment for upper tract tumour/cancer/carcinoma”, “topical instillation in the upper urinary tract”, and “urinary marker for urothelial carcinoma”. References within the identified literature were explored and evaluated for relevance. Results KSS is recommended for both low-risk and selected high-risk UTUC with imperative indications such as solitary kidney. Studies have shown comparable oncological outcomes after KSS including endoscopic ablation, segmental ureterectomy, and topical instillation of novel agents when compared to radical nephroureterectomy in well-selected cases. The development of novel diagnostic tools and risk-stratifying models allows optimal case selection for KSS without compromising oncological outcomes. Conclusion Kidney-sparing approach for UTUC is an evolving and promising area in urologic oncology, driven by advances in technology, better diagnostic tools, and novel therapeutic agents. Our article provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements and clinical recommendations. While current evidence is mainly based on retrospective studies, prospective trials are required to address important but unanswered clinical questions in this field.

A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed and Embase databases to identify related English-language studies published within the last 10 years. Key search words included “upper urinary tract tumour/cancer/carcinoma”, “kidney-sparing surgery or approach”, “endoscopic treatment for upper tract tumour/cancer/carcinoma”, “topical instillation in the upper urinary tract”, and “urinary marker for urothelial carcinoma”. References within the identified literature were explored and evaluated for relevance. 3 Diagnosis and workup for UTUC Haematuria, either gross or microscopic, is the most common symptom, occurring in up to two-thirds of UTUC patients [ 9 10 3 3.1 Role of cross-sectional imaging CT urogram (CTU) and magnetic resonance urogram (MRU) have been shown to detect UTUC with high sensitivities of 92% and 75%, respectively [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Regarding positron emission tomography in combination with CT (PET/CT), it is mainly used for the detection of lymph node metastasis and distal metastasis, and thus its role in local staging is limited by the physiological excretion of the radiotracer through the urinary system. In a retrospective analysis by Voskuilen et al. [ 18 3 3.2 Urine cytology and novel biomarkers While the use of urine cytology has been incorporated as part of the workup for haematuria in the EAU guidelines, its applicability in selecting the suitable cases for KSS has to be carefully scrutinised. There have been limited retrospective series documenting the performance of urine cytology in predicting aggressive disease, potentially limiting the possibility of performing KSS. Urine cytology has been used in research models to predict histological UTUC, high-grade, or muscle-invasive disease [ 19 20 p p 21 22 23 24 in situ 25 26 27 28 29 30 in situ While these tools may provide additional information and may help identify patients at risk for high-grade and advanced disease—which in turn can preclude KSS—further investigation is vital to improve the utility of urinary markers on predicting the aggressiveness of UTUC. 3.3 URS and advancement in imaging systems Further endoscopic diagnostics using URS are used when there is no unambiguous diagnosis based on cross-sectional imaging or when KSS is contemplated. The use of URS to confirm UTUC before RNU remains controversial. On one hand, it enables assessment of the tumour size, morphology, multifocality of disease, and confirmation of histology via biopsy as well as endoscopic treatment of small tumours by laser ablation. On the other hand, there is conflicting evidence that URS before RNU may be associated with an increased risk of intravesical recurrence [ 31 21 3 Despite the advancement of the optical system, small lesions are still easily missed by digital or fiberoptic white light URS—up to 25% for papillary UTUC and 50% for CIS [ 32 33 34 35 Another modality is PDD. Fluorescent photosensitizers such as 5-aminolevulinic acid or hexaminolevulinate can be administered orally or by instillation. The endoscope is then introduced for detection of fluorescence emitted by tumours along the urinary tract [ 36 37 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a developing medical imaging technology that allows real-time, cross-sectional, three-dimensional imaging of tissue microstructure during URS. OCT uses near-infrared light to produce cross-sectional images and obtain depth information with high depth resolution. Sideward-looking OCT probes are small in size, at 3 Fr, making them compatible with flexible ureteroscopes [ 38 39 40 39 40 CLE, on the other hand, provides real-time in vivo 41 42 43 44 In the future, the use of OCT and CLE may allow more accurate intraoperative risk assessment and facilitate immediate treatment selection, reducing both the need for subsequent URS and the healthcare costs. The advancement of technology improves the accuracy of preoperative risk stratification and case selection for kidney-sparing approaches. Multiple preoperative factors and predictive models have been proposed to correlate with muscle-invasive or high-grade disease. The EAU guidelines suggest risk stratification based on tumour focality, size, tumour grading, pathological subtypes, and any invasive aspects of CT findings. Low-risk tumours and selected high-risk tumours with indications precluding RNU should be considered for KSS. A risk-stratification model proposed by the American Urological Association further sub-classifies “low-risk” and “high-risk” diseases into favorable and unfavorable risk groups based on endoscopic, radiological, and histological features, as well as any involvement of the lower tract [ 45 Table 1 3 Table 2 [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Table 1 Criteria for kidney-sparing approach (the European Association of Urology guidelines 2024 [ 3 Table 1 Feature Low risk a High risk Tumour focality - Unifocal disease - Multifocal Tumour size - Tumour size of <2 cm - Tumour size of 2 cm or above Tumour histology - Low-grade cytology or URS biopsy - High-grade cytology or URS biopsy - Histological subtype b Cross-sectional imaging finding - Absence of invasive aspect - Absence of hydronephrosis or lymph node involvement - Local invasion on CT, hydronephrosis or lymph node metastases Preferred treatment - Kidney-sparing approach - Radical nephroureterectomy URS, ureterorenoscopy. a All these factors need to be present. b Micropapillary, squamous, and sarcomatoid variants.

It is a solid-state laser which operates at a wavelength of 1940–2013 nm. This wavelength is closer to the peak absorption point of water; therefore, energy delivered by Tm:YAG is more effectively absorbed by cells, causing better ablation of tumours [ 56 57 ex vivo 58 59 60 59 58 61 Thulium fiber laser (TFL) has been recently introduced. Two main operative modes are available at a wavelength of 1940 nm: the TFL quasi-continuous mode and the TFL SuperPulsed mode. At a wavelength of 1940 nm, it has the highest water absorption coefficient among all available laser fibres [ 62 63 ex vivo 64 65 63 PDD has demonstrated its efficacy in promoting disease detection in initial diagnosis and surveillance. Recent studies have attempted to extend the use of PDD in detecting residual lesions during laser ablation. Yoshida et al. [ 66 67 Before laser ablation, biopsy of a suspected lesion with forceps is commonly performed to obtain histological details. However, in one of the four biopsies, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made because of inadequate tissue, crush artifact, or distorted architecture [ 68 69 en bloc 70 en bloc 71 en bloc In a systematic review that included 13 studies, with four studies being included in the meta-analysis, similar OS, cancer-specific survival, and bladder recurrence-free survival were reported between endoscopic management and RNU [ 72 59 73 74 After initial endoscopic treatment, early second-look URS within 60 days was recommended by guidelines in view of the high risk of recurrence (up to 50%). The outcomes of the second-look URS would also affect subsequent endoscopic findings and metastatic recurrence-free rates [ 75 4.2 Topical instillation after endoscopic management 4.2.1 Chemoablation (MMC) To achieve the optimal effect of topical treatment, the key is to achieve an effective therapeutic concentration in the target tissue. However, the effect of the local chemotherapy is limited by the short contact time between these liquid agents and urothelium due to continuous washing of urine, limited permeability of urothelium, and high resistance of urothelium to the therapeutic agent [ 76 77 78 vs. 79 80 81 e.g., 82 83 Local recurrences are commonly encountered after endoscopic ablation of UTUC, but the use of adjuvant instillation remains unclear. Common approaches to delivering intraureteric therapeutic agents include anterograde instillation via percutaneous nephrostomy, and retrograde instillation via ureteric catheter. Mitomycin C is one of the most studied agents with promising initial outcomes and tolerability [ 84 85 p 86 p 4.2.2 Immunotherapy (bacillus Calmette-Guérin [BCG]) First established in 1921 as a tuberculosis vaccine, BCG is a live-attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis 87 88 89 90 91 Regarding adjuvant BCG instillations, the efficacy of BCG has been variable, and the results were highly heterogeneous. Giannarini et al. [ 90 92 4.2.3 Summary of adjuvant instillation after endoscopic management Currently, all available studies are limited by their retrospective design and small sample sizes. Foerster et al. [ 93 3 4.2.4 Other novel agents Another novel modality for MMC of UTUC is photodynamic therapy. The role of photodynamic therapy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder has been investigated since the 1980s [ 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 Apart from instillation of therapeutic agents, the advancement of drug-eluting biodegradable stents (BUSs) as a novel delivery system provides another potential treatment option. It has the advantages of increased contact time between the anti-cancer drugs and the urothelium without the need for the second procedure to remove the stent after the drug delivery [ 101 102 103 104 105 in vitro in vivo 106 106 4.3 Segmental ureterectomy (SU) SU involves the resection of the diseased ureter and the reconstruction of the urinary tract by direct reimplantation, psoas-hitch, or the Boari flap technique. It has been widely investigated, demonstrating comparable oncological outcomes in low-risk disease when compared to RNU [ 107 108 109 110 p p 111 p p p p Regarding the role of lymph node dissection (LND), EAU guidelines supported the role of simultaneous LND with SU in cases of high-risk UTUC [ 3 112 4.4 Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) after SU Although there are comparable OS and cancer-specific survival between RNU and SU, the considerable risk of local recurrence necessitates new strategies to improve local control [ 113 114 115 116 117 118 118 4.5 Summary Endoscopic ablation is the main modality in KSS, followed by SU and topical instillation of a therapeutic agent. RNU, on the other hand, is a well-studied topic with long-term oncological outcomes available [ 119 Table 3 72 110 111 120 Table 4 Table 3 Key studies comparing the oncological outcomes of kidney-sparing surgery with RNU.

In a retrospective study conducted by Lindner et al. [ 124 125 126 p p 127 For novel urine markers, current studies showed promising diagnostic accuracy as discussed in the previous part of this article. Incorporating novel urine markers into the standard surveillance protocol may allow early detection of recurrence and hence, salvage treatment. However, the postulated benefit has yet to be determined. 6 Conclusion In selected UTUC patients, KSS can provide non-inferior oncological outcomes, better preserve renal function, and reduce treatment morbidities. Accurate preoperative risk stratification followed by comprehensive patient counseling is a rule of thumb. The advent of new imaging technology is expected to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, grading, and staging of UTUC, and conduce to patient selection for KSS. The long-term oncological outcomes have established the role of endoscopic ablation and SU in well-selected cases. Intraureteric administration of mitomycin C gel and photodynamic agents has given encouraging initial results, both in the chemoablative and adjuvant settings. Novel urinary markers provide convenient and non-invasive means to aid surveillance, but their additional benefits have yet to be confirmed. Further studies are warranted to establish the long-term efficacy and safety profile of these new treatment modalities.
