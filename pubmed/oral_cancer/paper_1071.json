[ 89 F. luteovirens 90 91 Therefore, the study of the biosynthesis systems mediated by F. luteovirens 4.4. Fresh-Keeping Function Ma Xuelan’s team [ 92 93 F. luteovirens 94 F. luteovirens F. luteovirens F. luteovirens (1) Multidimensional expansion in the field of food science and technology: cracking industry pain points The active molecules of yellow-green L. reevesii are in line with the trend of ‘naturalization, functionalization, and derogation’ and can cover many types of high-demand foods. a. Upgrading of dairy and plant-based foods In dairy products, selenium polysaccharide can be extended to cheese, fermented milk beverages, etc., such as low-fat cheese with 0.5~1.0 g/kg selenium polysaccharide, which can replace carrageenan as a natural thickener, improve taste, and supplement selenium (the average daily intake of selenium in Chinese adults is insufficient), matching the needs of ‘nutrition enhancement + clean label’. b. Fresh agricultural products loss preservation Fresh meat: extracellular polysaccharide (0.8~1.2 g/L) spray can form a protective film on the surface of fresh meat, extend the shelf life of cold storage from 3~5 days to 7~10 days, reduce fat oxidation rate by more than 30%, and reduce retail loss. (2) Cooperating with packaging technology: building a new system of ‘active packaging’ This new system breaks through the limitation of traditional packaging using only a physical barrier and realizes the dual function of ‘ barrier + preservation’. c. Enabled degradable packaging A coating of 1.0~1.5 g/L extracellular polysaccharides on the inside of biodegradable packaging, such as PLA and PLA, blocks oxygen and water, and polysaccharides slowly release antibacterial and anti-enzymes. For example, the shelf life of pre-cut broccoli is extended from 4~6 days to 10~12 days, and the packaging is degradable within 6 months, balancing preservation and environmental protection. d. Long-acting controlled release packaging design The active molecules were made into lipid microcapsules (1~5 μm) and embedded in packaging, which were released slowly with temperature and humidity. For example, after embedding these molecules in vacuum packaging of frozen shrimp, the thawing color retention rate increased by 40%, TVB-N decreased by 25%, and the preservation at−18 °C was more than 6 months, which helped the export of aquatic products. (3) Commercial value in line with trends e. Response to consumer demand Using active molecules matches 78% of consumers’ demand for ‘natural ingredients’ and 65% of consumers’ demand for ‘nutritional fortification’. Active molecules from natural sources can help companies create ‘clean label’ products, such as high-end yogurt. The unit price can be increased by 20~30%. f. Optimize the supply chain The shelf life of fresh food is extended by 50−100%, and the energy consumption of the cold chain is reduced by 30%. For example, the return rate of shrimp export is reduced from 8% to less than 2%, which is in line with the goal of ‘double carbon’ and rural revitalization. 4.5.

Polysaccharides can alleviate the weight loss of diabetic rats and promote glucose consumption. The correlation between antioxidant activity and flavonoid and phenylalanine metabolism in samples from different regions; antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of EPS fractions (ALF1 and ALF2) from liquid fermentation mycelia. Antioxidant activity was positively correlated with flavonoid content, which was affected by phenylalanine metabolism. ALF1 reduces MDA to protect cells by increasing the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT. The antioxidant and anti-cancer cell activities of the aqueous extract and acetone extract of the fruiting body; protective mechanism of fermentation broth (FBA) on skin photoaging. Acetone extract inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells; FBA alleviates photoaging by regulating the MAPK/AP-1 pathway. Immunization Regulating The activation of macrophages by β-glucan and α-glucan during digestion; effects of different doses of dextran on immune function (body weight, thymus index, immune factors) in immunosuppressed mice. Glucan activates macrophages, enhances proliferation, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion; low-dose α-glucan intraperitoneal injection has the best effect and promotes weight recovery. [ 27 77 78 79 80 81 Polysaccharides affect intestinal immunity in immunosuppressed mice by adjusting intestinal flora; improvement of DSS-induced colitis (body weight, colon structure, and inflammatory cell infiltration). As a prebiotic, polysaccharides can regulate intestinal flora and improve colitis. The bidirectional immune regulation of polysaccharides (enhancing anti-tumor immunity and maintaining basic immune homeostasis). It has a multi-target immune regulation network, and the relationship between polysaccharide configuration and immune effect needs to be further studied. Biocatalysis and Plant Regulation Gastrodin synthesis ability and transformation system; biocatalytic synthesis of betulinic acid; anti-inflammatory effect of synthetic gastrodin. The conversion rate of gastrodin was up to 85.2%, and the conversion rate of betulinic acid was 95%. [ 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 Effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the growth of rapeseed. VOCs significantly increased the fresh weight, dry weight, and soluble sugar content of rape seedlings. Preservation Functions Effect of selenium-enriched fermentation preparation of selenium polysaccharide on the quality of yoghurt. Improve a number of yogurt quality indicators (pH, protein, mineral elements, etc.). [ 92 93 94 Preservation effect and mechanism of extracellular polysaccharide compound solution on shrimp. The 1.5 g/L and 1.0 g/L polysaccharide solutions could inhibit the color change in shrimp, which was related to the inhibition of tyrosinase and antioxidant activity. Other Resistance Functions Anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-migraine, anti-aging, analgesic, and other functions. The water extract significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory factors such as NO and IL-6 in the serum of migraine rats; ethanol extract inhibited TNF-α secretion of macrophages. [ 50 95 96 97 Polysaccharides had cytotoxic effects on liver cancer and ovarian cancer cells, and the tumor inhibition rate of tumor-bearing mice was 42.48%. The crude polysaccharide prolonged the exercise endurance of mice and increased SOD activity. Figure 4 The functions of F. luteovirens 5. Outlook 5.1. Short-Term Goals 5.1.1. Multi-Omics Analysis of Bioactivity Mechanisms With the progress of omics technology, the internal mechanism of the active components of F. luteovirens 5.1.2. Preliminary Optimization of Artificial Domestication At the molecular level, the associations between gene expression and external factors (e.g., nutrients, micro-ecological environment) affecting mycelial growth should be refined to identify core regulatory factors.
