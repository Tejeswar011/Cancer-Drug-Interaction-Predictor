The present retrospective analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib + immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in MSS/mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) mCRC, having aimed to identify effective, low-toxicity regimens for personalized treatment. The present retrospective study evaluated patients with MSS/pMMR mCRC who had failed at least two prior lines of treatment (all patients had received standard first- and second-line chemotherapy) and were treated with fruquintinib plus programmed death-1 (PD-1) (PD-1 inhibitor combination group) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (PD-L1 inhibitor combination group) inhibitors at the Jiangsu Cancer Hospital (Nanjing, China). Clinical characteristics were collected, and the efficacy, safety and prognostic factors of fruquintinib plus different ICIs were analyzed. A total of 78 patients (PD-1 inhibitor combination group, n=63; PD-L1 inhibitor combination group, n=15) were included. Clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between the two groups (all P>0.05). The objective response rate (7.9 vs. 20.0%; P=0.363), disease control rate (74.6 vs. 60.0%; P=0.418) and median progression-free survival (PFS; 7.0 vs. 8.3 months; P=0.14) were comparable between the groups. Similarly, no significant difference in PFS was observed between patients treated with fruquintinib plus different PD-1 inhibitors (P=0.37). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 (hazard ratio=0.28; P<0.001) as an independent prognostic factor for PFS. The most common adverse events (AEs) were hypothyroidism (31.7 vs. 26.7%), proteinuria (23.8 vs. 33.3%) and hand-foot syndrome (20.6 vs. 33.3%). No AE-related deaths occurred in either group. The present study showed that fruquintinib plus ICIs could improve PFS in MSS mCRC with manageable toxicity, but there was no survival difference between treatment with the PD-1 and PD-L1 combinations. metastatic colorectal cancer microsatellite stability fruquintinib immunotherapy Jiangsu Provincial Cancer Hospital 2023 Hospital Science and Technology Development Fund ZL202308 The present study was funded by the Jiangsu Provincial Cancer Hospital 2023 Hospital Science and Technology Development Fund (grant no.

According to the 2022 cancer report in China, CRC remains the second most prevalent cancer and ranks fourth in cancer-associated mortalities ( 1 2 3 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, have recently transformed the landscape of clinical oncology. The KEYNOTE-016 study demonstrated that pembrolizumab provides durable antitumor activity and fewer treatment-related adverse events (AEs) supporting it as an efficacious first-line therapy in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient mCRC ( 4 5 8 At present, the primary challenge in treatment is how to modify therapeutic strategies to augment the sensitivity of patients with MSS-type mCRC to immunotherapy, thereby improving prognosis. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the combination of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors with ICIs has a synergistic antitumor effect ( 9 10 11 12 Moreover, the combination of fruquintinib and ICIs has shown promising therapeutic potential for CRC in both preclinical and clinical studies. Li et al 13 et al 13 et al 14 15 16 17 However, existing studies have notable limitations. Most trials focus on the combined effects of a single PD-1 inhibitor and fruquintinib. There is a lack of direct comparison between fruquintinib combined with different ICIs and an introduction to the side effects of the combination regimens. The present study systematically analyzed the efficacy and safety of different ICIs combined with fruquintinib in patients with MSS/pMMR mCRC. In contrast to the traditional fixed-dose model, the present study reviewed the drug dose intensity, administration time and sequence in the real world, which provided specific guidance for the optimization of the future administration regimen of immunotherapy combined with fruquintinib. At the same time, the present study also explored a more efficient and low-toxicity combination therapy model and further precisely selected the beneficiary population. The present study supports important clinical needs and scientific value. Materials and methods Study design and patients The present retrospective study analyzed the medical data of patients with MSS/pMMR mCRC between January 2022 and December 2023 at the Jiangsu Cancer Hospital (Nanjing, China). Patients who were aged 18–75 years with histopathologically or cytologically confirmed CRC and MSS/pMMR were eligible for the study. Patients were required to have failed at least two prior lines of treatment (all patients had received standard first- and second-line chemotherapy) and to have received fruquintinib plus PD-1 inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitor combination group) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors (PD-L1 inhibitor combination group). Patients also had to have radiologically confirmed metastases with at least one radiological-target lesion, a life expectancy of ≥3 months and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 ( 18 The present study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 version) and approved by the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Cancer Hospital (grant no. KY-2024-071). The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the present study. Treatments Regarding the initial dose of fruquintinib, the fruquintinib dose in the FRESCO-2 study ( 11 et al 14 In the PD-1 inhibitor combination group, the PD-1 inhibitors camrelizumab (200 mg), sintilimab (200 mg), tislelizumab (200 mg), toripalimab (240 mg) or serplulimab (300 mg) were chosen by the physician based on the condition of the patient, with intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. In the PD-L1 inhibitor combination group, envafolimab (200 mg) was administered by subcutaneous injection on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. All ICIs were continued until disease progression or severe intolerance. Outcomes and assessment Tumor responses were evaluated every 2 cycles through computed tomography (CT) in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines (version 1.1) ( 19 20 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp.) Baseline categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 Results Patient characteristics A total of 78 patients with mCRC were included, with 47 (60.3%) males and 31 (39.7%) females and a median age of 57 years. Subsequently, 63 patients received fruquintinib plus a PD-1 inhibitor (20 sintilimab, 13 tislelizumab, 11 camrelizumab, 9 toripalimab or 10 serplulimab) and 15 received fruquintinib plus a PD-L1 inhibitor (envafolimab). In the PD-1 inhibitor combination group, 10, 23 and 30 patients received initial doses of fruquintinib at 3, 4 and 5 mg, respectively, while in the PD-L1 inhibitor combination group, two, 9 and four patients received initial doses of 3, 4 and 5 mg, respectively. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the two groups (P>0.05; Table I Efficacy In the PD-1 inhibitor combination group, 5 (7.9%) patients had a PR and 42 (66.7%) patients had an SD, achieving an ORR of 7.9% and a DCR of 74.6% ( Table II Table II Fig. 1 In the PD-1 inhibitor combination group, five PD-1 inhibitors were administered. Subgroup analysis showed no statistically significant differences in PFS between patients treated with sintilimab, tislelizumab, camrelizumab, toripalimab or serplulimab (P=0.37; Fig. 2 Table III Table III Safety The AEs during treatment in both groups were predominantly grade 1–2 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 ( 20 The treatment was discontinued in 2 patients in the PD-1 inhibitor combination group due to immune-related diabetes and immune-related hepatic injury, respectively. In the PD-L1 inhibitor combination group, no patients discontinued treatment for AEs. Additionally, the incidence of AEs did not differ significantly between the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor combination group (P>0.05, Table IV Table V The present findings are preliminary and recommend conducting well-designed prospective cohort studies or multi-center collaborations in the future, including a larger sample size, to validate the present findings and draw more conclusive conclusions. Discussion Immunotherapy has become a research hotspot in the treatment of mCRC, with the combination of ICIs and TKIs being widely endorsed and established as the mainstream treatment strategy in later-line therapies. The REGONIVO trial reported an ORR of >30% in patients with MSS-type mCRC who received regorafenib plus nivolumab therapy, demonstrating favorable efficacy along with favorable safety ( 21 The inconsistency between the DCR and ORR is a common and well-elucidated phenomenon ( 22 24 The findings of the present study were consistent with another retrospective study reported by Yang et al 16 et al 25 et al 17 The CheckMate-142 ( 26 27 28 In the present study, univariate analysis indicated that age, ECOG performance status and liver metastasis were associated with PFS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified an ECOG performance status of 1 as an independent risk factor for PFS. Immunotherapy exerts its effect by activating immune cells that specifically recognize and eliminate tumor cells, requiring a sufficient immune cell reserve. Patients with an ECOG performance status of 0 generally have improved physical conditions and a stronger immune response. In the CheckMate 153 trial ( 29 30 et al 31 KRAS 32 33 The most common AEs previously reported with fruquintinib plus ICIs were hypertension, hand-foot syndrome and hypothyroidism. In the present study, the most common AEs in the PD-1 inhibitor combination group were hypothyroidism (31.7%), proteinuria (23.8%) and hand-foot syndrome (20.6%). In the PD-L1 inhibitor combination group, the most common AEs were proteinuria (33.3%), hand-foot syndrome (33.3%) and hypothyroidism (26.7%). No deaths due to serious AEs were reported in either group. The present study has several limitations. Firstly, it is a single-center, retrospective analysis, which might introduce selection bias. Secondly, the administration of five different PD-1 inhibitors and three initial doses of fruquintinib in the PD-1 inhibitor combination group might have affected treatment consistency. Next, the sample size was relatively small and the follow-up period was relatively short. The reason why the sample size, especially the PD-L1 inhibitor combination group, is small is that fruquintinib is only reimbursed by Chinese medical insurance for third-line colorectal cancer treatment, with no coverage beyond this line. Immunotherapy drugs are not covered for colorectal cancer at all. Consequently, few patients can afford the combination of immunotherapy and fruquintinib. Affordability is even lower for combinations involving PD-L1 inhibitors due to their higher cost. Additionally, the present study has limitations in safety assessment, as the small sample size limits the ability to detect rare toxicities and the relatively short follow-up time affects the assessment of long-term toxicities. In the future, large-scale real-world research should be carried out to confirm safety, explore biomarkers for toxicity prediction and optimize adverse reaction management strategies. Although there was no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the groups of fruquintinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor and fruquintinib combined with PD-L1 inhibitor, it should be noted that the statistical power of this result was low and it should be regarded as a preliminary finding that needs to be verified in future larger-scale studies. Similarly, for the present results where no significant difference was found, the possibility of clinically relevant differences should not be ruled out as the lack of significance may be due to insufficient sample size. Finally, one of the other major limitations of the present study is the lack of mature OS data. This is mainly because the follow-up time at the data cut-off was relatively short and some patients were lost to follow-up. Therefore, it is currently impossible to evaluate the long-term survival benefits of the present study based on OS. Against the backdrop of a high risk of loss to follow-up, the present study considered earlier-occurring endpoints with more reliable data acquisition (such as PFS or ORR) as the primary endpoints. The data collection was relatively complete (loss to follow-up occurred after the PFS event), so the analysis results were reliable and clinically meaningful. Future studies should pre-set a more rigorous analysis plan for OS in the case of a high loss-to-follow-up rate in the protocol. In future studies, we will be committed to improving the survival follow-up strategy and investing more resources in designing and implementing a more powerful survival follow-up strategy. In conclusion, although no statistically significant differences in efficacy were observed between the PD-1 inhibitor combination group and the PD-L1 inhibitor combination group, fruquintinib plus ICIs improved survival compared with the previously reported efficacy of fruquintinib monotherapy in mCRC. Furthermore, this combination therapy did not increase serious AEs, indicating an acceptable safety profile. Future clinical trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the findings of the present study and explore the potential of immunotherapy plus targeted therapy to establish new treatment strategies for mCRC in clinical practice.
