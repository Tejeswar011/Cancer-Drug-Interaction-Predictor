While individual additives used within specified limits are considered safe, examining the effects of food additives is essential, especially when they are ingested in combination or when consumption exceeds acceptable daily intake levels. In this study, the effects of three common food preservatives—sodium benzoate (SB), potassium sorbate (PS), and citric (Cit) acid—on biochemical markers and histopathology of the male reproductive system were evaluated. Thirty‐six male Sprague–Dawley rats received the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) doses of SB, PS, and Cit alone or in combination in their drinking water for 8 weeks. Blood samples and the epididymis and testes were surgically collected for analysis. Results showed significant decreases in testicular weight, reduced sperm count and viability, and increased immotile sperm in the SB, PS, and SB + PS groups. These changes were associated with notable decreases in plasma testosterone levels in all treated groups. Elevated lipid peroxidation levels, increased Bax/Bcl‐2 ratios, and caspase‐3 activity in the combined groups demonstrated induction of apoptosis in testes. Additionally, histopathological analysis revealed degenerative changes in testicular structure and disruption of spermatogenesis. In conclusion, the combined use of these preservatives may lead to reproductive issues in rats, raising concerns about their potential effects on human health.

Introduction The transformation in dietary habits has prompted the food industry to incorporate various additives that enhance shelf life and improve physicochemical properties of processed foods [ 1 2 3 4 7 PS has an acceptable daily intake of 25 mg/kg body weight established by JECFA [ 3 Research indicates that PS can induce genotoxic effects in human lymphocytes and cause DNA strand breakage with potential carcinogenic effects [ 8 9 10 Cit acid, while naturally occurring and FDA‐approved, has been shown to cause toxicity in dental cells, hepatocyte alterations, and chromosomal damage [ 11 12 Previous research has demonstrated that food additives significantly impact reproductive systems, with recent studies showing that PS alters semen parameters and testicular architecture in male rats [ 13 14 While individual effects of these preservatives have been studied, their combined impact remains poorly understood. People typically consume multiple preservatives simultaneously through processed foods, potentially leading to synergistic effects that exceed individual acceptable daily intake values [ 15 However, ADI values are generally assigned for single substances, and combined exposure can lead to additive toxic effects, which have not been fully characterized in many cases. Therefore, investigating specific preservative combinations helps uncover any unexpected toxicological effects, enabling the development of safer guidelines and regulatory limits for their combined use. This research is aimed at analyzing the effects of Cit acid, SB, and PS, both separately and in combination, on the reproductive system of male rats. 2. Methods 2.1. Animals and Experimental Design Thirty‐six male Sprague–Dawley rats were sourced from the Center of Comparative and Experimental Medicine of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. The study followed the ethical guidelines of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences for laboratory animal care and handling (Ethics Code: IR.SUMS.AEC.1402.051). Following a 1‐week acclimatization period, the rats were allocated into six experimental groups ( n 7 2.2. Blood Sample Collection and Testis Preparation At the end of treatment, the animals were administered anesthesia via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine at dosages of 100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Blood samples were collected through cardiac puncture for serum separation and were subsequently stored at −20°C until analysis of testosterone levels. The epididymis and testes were surgically excised, and their weights were recorded. The left testes were preserved in a 10% formalin solution for future histopathological evaluations. The right testes were promptly transferred to a −80°C freezer for gene expression assays, assessment of total antioxidant capacity, measurement of lipid peroxidation, and evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. For sperm analysis, sperm was extracted from the left cauda epididymis. 2.3. Body and Reproductive Organ Weights Body weights were noted before sacrifice; testes and epididymis were removed, cleared of adipose and connective tissues, and weighed. Then, relative organ weights were computed. Testis and epididymis relative weight was measured by the organ weight index formula [ 16 Organ  weight  index = organ  weight body  weight × 100 . 2.4. Semen Characteristics Sperm motility characteristics and the number of epididymal sperm were assessed under a microscope. The caudal epididymis was minced in warm phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS; 35°C; pH = 7.4) to obtain epididymal sperm. By placing a drop of sperm suspension on a coverslip‐covered glass slide and monitoring the sperm under a 400x magnification Zeiss compound light microscope (fitted with a 35°C hotstage), the motility of the sperm was recorded. Using a light microscope with 200x magnification, 10 μ 2.5. Reproductive Hormone Testosterone was determined using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The assay was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.6. Markers of Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Parameters in Testis Tissue 2.6.1. Testicular ROS The assessment of ROS levels in testicular tissue was performed utilizing the fluorescent probe dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH‐DA) [ 17 μ μ 2.6.2. Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) of Testis Tissue The antioxidant capacity of testicular tissue was assessed by measuring its FRAP [ 18 μ 2.6.3. Testicular Lipid Peroxidation The evaluation of lipid peroxidation in testis tissue was conducted utilizing the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay [ 19 w v w v w v w v 2.7. The Quantitative Real‐Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Rat testes were examined for the expression of apoptosis‐related genes (Bax, Bcl‐2, and caspase‐3) through real‐time PCR [ 20 ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ β ′ ′ ′ ′ β − Δ Δ 2.8. Histopathological Examination Following the euthanasia of the animals, the testicular tissues were excised and promptly preserved in 10% formaldehyde. Subsequently, the tissues underwent dehydration through a series of increasing ethanol concentrations, followed by embedding in paraffin. For histopathological assessment, Masson’s trichromatic staining (Merck, Germany) was utilized. 2.9. Statistical Analysis GraphPad Prism 6 software (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, United States) was utilized for conducting the statistical analysis. A p To analyze the histomorphometric parameters, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using log2‐transformed signal data. Pearson’s correlation was employed as the distance metric for clustering, utilizing R software (Version 4.3.1). 3. Results 3.1. Alterations in Organ Weight Index The relative weight of the testis exhibited a significant decrease across all treatment groups, with the exception of the Cit group, which demonstrated an increase when compared to the control group ( p 1a p 1b Figure 1 Effects of food preservatives on (a) testicular weight index and (b) epididymis weight index.

Discussion This study demonstrated that SB and PS administration significantly reduced testicular and epididymal weight indices compared to controls. These findings align with previous research showing that reproductive toxicants commonly affect testicular weight through compromised spermatogenesis and oxidative stress [ 21 The combination of SB and PS resulted in reduced sperm count, while PS alone and PS + SB negatively affected sperm viability and motility. These impairments may be linked to decreased testosterone levels and elevated MDA, suggesting compromised sperm membrane integrity, consistent with recent findings by Ogunro et al. [ 14 Testosterone levels decreased significantly across all treatment groups, with Cit, PS, and PS + SB showing the most pronounced reductions. This decline is critical as testosterone maintains testicular structure and spermatogenesis [ 22 The observed reduction in testosterone likely contributed to the decreased testicular weight and impaired sperm characteristics observed in this study. While ROS levels remained stable, elevated MDA in PS, PS + SB, and Cit + SB groups indicated ongoing lipid peroxidation. This suggests that existing ROS levels were sufficient to trigger oxidative damage, possibly due to overwhelmed antioxidant systems [ 23 The maintenance of total antioxidant capacity alongside elevated MDA levels indicates that while the system’s general antioxidant capacity was preserved, lipid‐specific protection was inadequate, leading to selective lipid peroxidation [ 24 Apoptosis occurred in PS and PS + SB groups, confirmed by elevated Bax/Bcl‐2 ratios and caspase‐3 expression. The proapoptotic protein Bax promotes cytochrome C release, which activates caspase‐3 and initiates cell death [ 25 Histological analysis revealed decreased testicular epithelial thickness with minor changes in seminiferous tubule diameter. This pattern typically indicates selective germ cell loss while preserving tubular architecture, often resulting from hormonal imbalances or oxidative stress affecting the germinal epithelium without major structural damage [ 26 27 The reduction in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids across different spermatogenic stages indicates comprehensive impairment of sperm production. Spermatogonia reduction suggests disrupted spermatogenesis initiation, while spermatocyte and spermatid decreases indicate problems in meiotic and differentiation phases, respectively [ 28 These findings are consistent with El‐Shennawy et al. [ 2 13 4.1. Limitations and Suggestions This study was conducted over a specific timeframe and dose range. Long‐term exposure effects and dose–response relationships require further investigation. Additionally, molecular pathway analysis could provide deeper mechanistic insights. It is suggested that future studies examine the reversibility of these effects upon cessation of exposure and investigate protective interventions. 5. Conclusion This study demonstrated the effects of three commonly used food preservatives, individually and in combination, on the male reproductive system in rats. The findings indicated that these chemicals can negatively impact sperm production, resulting in decreased viable and motile sperm, as well as significant changes in testicular histological appearance. Additionally, the preservatives may impair testicular function by causing lipid peroxidation, reducing testosterone levels, and inducing apoptosis. Notably, while Cit is classified as GRAS, the adverse effects identified in the male reproductive system in this study have not been previously documented for Cit acid treatment. Combined use of these preservatives may lead to reproductive issues in rats, raising concerns about their potential effects on human health. These results are consistent with previous studies on the adverse effects of preservative consumption; however, further research is needed to understand their impact on other critical systems and female reproductive health.
