Introduction Sleep is an important physiological process that promotes central nervous system (CNS) metabolism, strengthens memory, and regulates mood [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 7 8 9 Sleep disorders are not only associated with decreased quality of life and productivity [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 Total SD is the most commonly used sleep manipulation technique in rodents, and many SD paradigms have been developed in mice, including gentle handling, a moving treadmill, the roller method, multiple platforms over water, and curling prevention by water [ 7 19 20 21 22 22 EC is a liquid nutritional supplement commonly used in Southeast Asia and traditional Chinese medicine, with multiple health benefits and remedies [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Herein, we hypothesized that EC might alleviate SD-related metabolic changes by increasing specific metabolites and bioactives in mice. To test this hypothesis, we first used metabolomics analysis based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify the changes in serum and brain metabolic profiles of mice after supplementing with EC at different time points. Following this, the changes in characteristic metabolites and metabolic pathways in the serum and brain of SD mice supplemented with EC were determined. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Dosage Information The EC used in this study was prepared from chicken meat, as described previously [ 31 32 33 2.2. Animals and Experimental Design Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the China National Laboratory Animal Resource Center (Shanghai, China). Mice were kept in a clean animal facility with a constant temperature (22–25 °C) and controlled lighting (12/12 h dark/light cycle) for at least one week for acclimatization. Food and water were given ad libitum. To first measure the concentrations of specific EC bioactives in the blood and brain, a kinetic study was performed. Mice were fasted overnight and divided into 3 groups: (1) control group, mice were gavaged with saline; (2) 1× EC group, mice were gavaged with 1107 mg/kg EC; and (3) 2× EC group, mice were gavaged with 2214 mg/kg EC. At the baseline and after 15, 30, 60, and 120 min of EC administration, the mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen ( n Next, to determine the effects of EC on plasma metabolome and brain function markers in SD mice, mice were divided into 5 groups as follows: (1) control group, mice were orally administrated saline, n n n n n 2.3. Sleep Deprivation Procedure SD was initiated at the beginning of the light cycle, and the procedure was conducted using a 6 h mild conditioning protocol, as described previously [ 34 2.4. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Total RNA from mouse hippocampus, cortex samples, and pineal gland ( n 35 Table S1 2.5. Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay (ELISA) Assay The whole blood samples from the mice were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected for the experiment. The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the serum ( n 2.6. Untargeted Metabolic Profiling Mouse serum and brain samples ( n 36 2.7. Targeted Metabolic Profiling Mouse serum ( n v v 2.8. Metabolomic Data Analysis The qualitative and quantitative results of the metabolites were normalized using Z-score normalization to eliminate differences in scale and magnitude between different samples, facilitating subsequent statistical analyses. Stringent selection criteria were used to identify significantly altered metabolites. Initially, preliminary screening of the metabolite data using principal coordinate analysis (PCA) was performed to assess the overall differences between samples. Subsequently, univariate statistical analyses, such as t p 2.9. Statistical Analysis All data are given as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Power analysis showed that n 37 p 3. Results 3.1. Effect of EC on Serum Metabolomics Based on the Kinetic Study The specific EC bioactives were determined through untargeted LC/MS metabolomics, and principal coordinate analysis (PCA) of all time points in the control, 1× EC, and 2× EC groups revealed slight discrimination among the three groups ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 KEGG pathway analysis of the TOP20 functions of metabolites in the serum revealed that EC administration caused a marked alteration in the enriched pathways at T15 and T30 ( Figure S1 Figure S1 Figure S1a,b Figure S1c,d Figure S1 3.2. Effect of EC on the Serum Metabolite Profiles of Mice at Different Time Points Next, to find the common metabolites affected by 1× EC and 2× EC, Venn diagram analyses were performed. There were 22 and 57 metabolites significantly changed by 1× EC and 2× EC, respectively, and 16 commonly affected metabolites at T15 compared to the control group ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 To also find the bioactives that might be critical for EC consumption, the metabolites significantly increased by EC were visualized using line graphs ( Figure S2 Figure S2 Figure S2 Figure S2 3.3. Effect of EC on Brain Metabolomics Based on Kinetic Study Next, the effect of EC on brain metabolites was determined, and PCA of all time points in the control, 1× EC, and 2× EC groups revealed a clear discrimination among the three ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure S3 Figure S3 3.4. Effect of EC on the Brain Metabolite Profiles of Mice at Different Time Points Next, the Venn diagram revealed that 23 and 15 metabolites were significantly changed by 1× EC and 2× EC, respectively, and there were only 3 commonly affected metabolites at T15 compared to the control group ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 The line graphs showed that the levels of metabolites displayed a clear time-dependent change, with most displaying a peak mainly at T30 ( Figure S4 Figure S4 Figure S4 3.5. Effect of EC on Serum Neurotransmitter Levels in the SD Mice Next, the effect of EC on SD was determined. The mRNA expression of the markers related to SD in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was first analyzed via RT-qPCR. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, SD caused a significant increase in the expression of these genes compared to the control group, while EC downregulated the expression of these genes in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure S5 Figure S5a,b Aanat Mao-b Tph2 Aanat Figure S5c Mao-b Tph2 Figure S5c To first determine whether EC administration could affect the levels of neurotransmitters, ELISA analysis of serum 5-HT level, as one of the most abundant neurotransmitters, was first conducted. SD caused a marked decrease in the serum 5-HT level, which tended to be increased by EC ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 3.6. Effect of EC on Serum Metabolite Profiles in SD Mice Finally, untargeted metabolomics analysis of the serum was performed to determine whether the effect of EC on SD depends on specific bioactives or metabolites. Similarly to the results of neurotransmitters, PCA showed slight separation among different groups ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 3.7. EC-Induced Changes in Specific Active Substances in Serum Metabolites of SD Mice A Venn diagram was used to identify the number of common metabolites found in different groups to find the specific metabolite changes after SD and EC treatment. A total of 42 common metabolites were found in the three EC-treated groups, and 26 common metabolites were found in all groups ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 To better understand the effect of EC on the serum metabolites, the relative levels of nine common metabolites were analyzed using bar graphs ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 EC and SD altered several common serum metabolites. ( a b c d p p p p + p ++ p 3.8. Correlation Analysis of Differential Metabolites and SD-Related Genes Next, a correlation analysis was performed between the common metabolites and the SD-related gene expression ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Arc Nr4a1 Egr1 Figure 8 4. Discussion EC is a complex that contains bioactive peptides and amino acids [ 38 16 39 24 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 Unlike the changes in metabolites in serum, mainly concentrated at 15 and 30 min, we found that metabolic changes in the brain were most significant at 30 min, with marked differences in the types of metabolites compared to the serum. According to reports, small molecules enter the bloodstream through liver metabolism after digestion in the intestine and then selectively enter the brain through the BBB, thereby exerting a protective effect on the CNS [ 47 48 49 50 Neurotransmitters and their metabolites in the CNS play an important role in stress relief, mood regulation, and hypnosis [ 51 52 53 54 38 55 56 57 58 59 59 EC treatment not only significantly enriched the pathways of amino acid metabolism but also significantly enriched the pathways of the synaptic vesicle cycle, GABAergic synapse, and tyrosine metabolism. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and it exerts its effects through GABAergic synapses to modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission [ 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 Enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways revealed that carbon metabolism, amino acid biology, and cAMP signaling pathways were significantly enriched in SD mice following EC ingestion. Amino acid metabolism plays an important role in redox balance, energy regulation, biosynthetic support, and homeostasis maintenance [ 67 68 25 69 70 71 24 72 73 74 75 SD influences gene expression through diverse mechanisms, including epigenetic modification, transcriptional regulation, and mRNA processing [ 76 20 77 78 C-fos Egr1 Arc Nr4a 79 Arc 80 C-fos 79 Tph2 Aanat 81 Tph2 Aanat 81 82 Mao-b 83 Tph2 Aanat Mao-b We performed a correlation analysis of 42 common metabolites with SD-related genes and found that the increased metabolites after EC intake were negatively correlated with the expression of SD genes. This further validated the potential of these metabolites as biomarkers of EC. However, compared to the previous serum kinetic study, SD caused significant changes in different serum metabolites in mice, such as 2-Methoxyestrone, phenylacetylglycine, isopropylparaben, N-acetyl-D-tryptophan, avermectin A1b aglycone, imidazoleacetic acid, and isocitric acid. A study on 12 healthy male subjects found that SD caused disruptions in the bioclock and led to changes in the metabolic composition of the blood [ 35 84 The identified metabolites may serve as potential biomarkers mediating the effects of EC on SD. Specifically, L-arginine serves as an essential amino acid mediating multiple physiological processes, including NO production and neurotransmitter synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that EC treatment significantly elevates serum levels of L-arginine, γ-L-glutamyl-L-2-aminobutyrate (a glutamate metabolite regulating neurotransmitter balance), and 3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, suggesting that these metabolites may function as potential biomarkers of the effects of EC on SD. While the sleep-promoting properties of L-arginine through NO-dependent mechanisms are established [ 85 86 87 5. Conclusions In summary, we identified significant changes in biomarkers in the serum and brain of mice after EC administration and metabolomic changes after EC intake during SD, and these changes were time-dependent. Under acute SD conditions, EC may regulate sleep-related neural functions by upregulating the blood 5-HT content, alleviating abnormal neurotransmitters, and altering some serum biomarkers. These results provide clues for further understanding the multiple roles of EC.
