Percutaneous release of the A1 pulley demonstrates a better outcome than steroid injection in the treatment of TF; however, evidence remains limited. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effect of percutaneous release of the A1 pulley compared to local steroid injection in the treatment of trigger fingers in Nepal. Methods A hospital-based randomized clinical trial among 92 patients aged 18 years and above suffering from trigger fingers that were unresponsive to conservative treatment was conducted to evaluate the effect of the percutaneous release of A1 pulley and steroid injection. Quinnell’s classification, visual analogue scale (VAS) scoring system and thickness of A1 pulley, as well as the flexor tendon in the affected site, were assessed before and after intervention at six months. Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square tests were performed to compare the effectiveness of both treatments. Result Percutaneous release of the A1 pulley showed better functional improvement than steroid injection, with a p-value of < 0.001 and medium effect size of 0.43. The pain score was also decreased more in the percutaneous release group than the steroid group (-5.1 ± 1.4 versus − 3.7 ± 1.8), with the group difference of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.6 to 2.0), with a p-value of < 0.001 and a large effect size of 0.87. Nevertheless, steroid injection decreased the thickness of A1 pulley than percutaneous release (-0.34 ± 0.24 versus − 0.21 ± 0.21), with a p-value of 0.011 and a large effect size of 0.5. Furthermore, tendon thickness was decreased more in the steroid group compared with the percutaneous release group (-1.12 ± 0.73 versus − 0.34 ± 0.41), with a p-value of < 0.001 and a huge effect size of 1.31. Conclusion Percutaneous release of A1 pulley illustrated greater improvement in functional mobility with a moderate effect size and pain with a large effect size compared to steroid injection in trigger fingers. A multicenter trial with a larger sample size and involving a diverse participant cohort may enhance the strength of the evidence.

It also aimed to find out the morphological changes in the percutaneous release of the A1 pulley in trigger fingers, which may be the pioneer study. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 updated guidelines for reporting for RCTs [ 29 30 31 32 Sample size determination No previous studies have been conducted in Nepal on this topic. Therefore, we initiated a pilot study involving 10 patients. Based on the success rate observed in the pilot study, we calculated the minimum sample size required for this study. The sample size was calculated based on the pilot study in Nepal Orthopaedic Hospital with a trigger finger success rate for the patients in the steroid injection group versus percutaneous release group on the basis of the persistence of pain/discomfort or hand movement function, which was 83% versus 100% respectively. With an α level of significance at 5% and power of 80%, the sample size was calculated using a test comparing two independent proportions in Stata/MP version 14.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). The calculated sample size is 84 (42 participants in each group). To take into account a 10% loss through follow-up and drop out, the total sample size was 92 (46 participants in the steroid injection group and 46 participants in the percutaneous release group). Randomization Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and assigned to either the steroid injection group or the percutaneous release of the A1 pulley group randomly (Fig. 2 33 37 Fig. 2 Flow chart of the study Intervention The participants with trigger fingers were diagnosed clinically by experienced orthopaedic surgeons. After obtaining informed consent from the patients, they were allocated either to the steroid group or the percutaneous group on the basis of randomization. Percutaneous release of A1 pulley Percutaneous release of A1 pulley was performed in the well-managed operation theatre set up with the preparation of skin and injection of 1 ml (2%) of plain lidocaine. After waiting a few minutes to attain a better anaesthetic effect, the proper location of the pulley was identified using surface landmarks in each digit with an 18-gauge needle. The needle was longitudinally moved by keeping the bevel of the needle parallel to achieve a tendon-grating sensation for the confirmation of the cut of the pulley. At last, a sterile dressing was applied [ 38 Steroid injection The skin was cleansed with alcohol over the A1 pulley region. A mixture of 1 ml of injection Depo-Medrol 40 mg (methylprednisolone) and 1 ml lignocaine (0.25%) in a 3 ml syringe was inserted into the flexor tendon sheath over A1 pulley at a slightly oblique angle through the palmar skin in the affected digit. Patients were asked to flex and extend their fingers while injecting. This procedure was also performed in the operating theatre for patient safety. These techniques have been mentioned in the previous studies [ 15 22 39 The procedure was performed without ultrasound guidance due to the lack of such facilities at the research site institution. All patients were counselled to follow up in the next visit at six months. Information was again recorded at six months of follow-up [ 40 Study variables Outcome variables The primary outcomes were the functional mobility and pain of the participants; the secondary outcome measure was the thickness of the A1 pulley and tendon. The functional mobility was assessed through Quinnell’s classification field [ 38 41 42 43 44 45 1 46 47 Participant’s information Age and sex of participants were recorded. Similarly, a clinical parameter such as plain radiographs of the affected hand was performed to find out the presence/absence of any other hand pathologies. Safety issue The side effects of the steroid injection may be local versus systemic or immediate versus delayed. Local side effects may be flare, skin hypopigmentation and atrophy, infection, tendon rupture, progression of osteoarthritis and osseous injury, while systemic side effects include adrenal suppression, facial flushing, hypertension, hyperglycemia and osteoporosis [ 14 23 48 49 50 16 51 14 As this study was performed in a specialized orthopedic and trauma care hospital, there was no worry about the management if any immediate adverse reaction might have occurred. The principal author recorded all data about adverse effects found. Luckily, no participants had to face with such side effects. A review also did not find any side effects of steroid injection in trigger fingers [ 16 Ethical consideration Ethical clearance was obtained from the Ethical Review Board (ERB) of the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) (Reference number 442, issued on 26 August 2022). We constituted a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of two orthopedic surgeons and one statistician as per the requirements set by NHRC for the ethical approval. The DSMB members prepared study-stopping rules and reviewed all the possible effects reported. Similarly, we prepared Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Investigator Brochure and Case Report Form (CRP). Also, all of the investigators had Good Clinical Practice (GCP) certificates. Similarly, the clinical trial was registered to clinicaltrilregistry.gov (Identifier: NCT05383040 Statistical analysis The collected data were entered in Epi-Data version 3.2 and transferred into SPSS version 20 for analysis. Socio-demographic data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for the numerical data, such as VAS score for pain, thickness of A1 pulley and thickness of flexor tendon sheath. The normality of distributed data was checked by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Having confirmed the normality, analysis were made by comparing the means and standard deviation using the student’s two-sample t-test and Levene’s Test for equality of variance for measurement. Similarly, the qualitative data, such as functional movement measured with Quinnell’s grading system, were presented in frequency and percentage, and the Mann-Whitney U test was applied for the change in the qualitative ordinal data among both groups. Furthermore, the statistical analysis for categorical variables, such as the complications of treatment, was performed using the chi-square test. All probability values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Participants’ clinical information At baseline, a total of 92 participants were included in this study (46 participants in the steroid group and 46 in the percutaneous group). However, after six months of follow-up, a total of 91 participants completed the study (46 participants in the steroid group and 45 participants in the percutaneous group) (Fig. 2 Most of the participants were female (approx. 85%), and they were proportionally comparable in both groups. A slightly higher proportion of males were in the steroid group (17%) versus 13% in the percutaneous group. Similarly, regarding the age group, both groups had comparable percentages of participants in the age group. In addition to these, both groups had a similar proportion of affected trigger thumb (first digit), but the steroid group had more participants having 3rd and 4th digit trigger fingers (Table 1  Table 1 Baseline characteristics of participants Variables Steroid group n Percutaneous release group n n (%) n (%) Sex Male 8 (17) 6 (13) Female 38 (83) 40 (87) Age in years (mean ± SD) 50.11 ± 10.25 51.61 ± 11.31 Side Right hand 30 (65) 29 (63) Left hand 16 (35) 17 (37) Affected digit 1 st 36 (78) 42 (91) 3 rd 6 (13) 3 (7) 4 th 4 (9) 1 (2) Primary outcomes The primary outcome was the functional movements, which were measured with Quinnell’s grading system, and baseline data were found to be comparable. At baseline, 33% respondents in the steroid group and 22% respondents in the percutaneous group had Grade-2 trigger fingers. They were found to be improved more in percutaneous release than the steroid group at six months. There were 49% and 15% patients with Grade 0 in the percutaneous release group and steroid group, respectively, with the p p 2 Table 2 Comparison of pain, A1 pulley thickness and tendon thickness between the steroid group and percutaneous release group Variables Steroid group Percutaneous release group (n=45) Difference (95% CI) P value Effect size Mean + VAS score Baseline 6.3 + 6.3 + 0.0 (-0.4, 0.4) 1.00 0.00 d End line 2.6 + 1.1 + 1.4 (0.7, 2.0) <0.001 * 1.41 d Difference -3.7 ± 1.8 -5.1 ± 1.4 1.3 (0.6, 2.0) <0.001 * 0.87 d Thickness of the A1 pulley Baseline 1.47 + 1.45 + 0.01  (-0.13, 0.16) 0.864 0.056 d End line 1.12 + 1.23 + -0.10 (-0.23, 0.01) 0.096 0.36 d Difference -0.34 ± 0.24 -0.21 ± 0.21 -0.12 (-0.22, -0.02) 0.011 * 0.5 d Thickness of the tendon Baseline 3.57 + 3.56 + 0.01  (-2.28, 0.25) 0.885 0.01 d End line 2.44 + 3.19 + -0.74 (-0.99, -4.92) <0.001 * 1.24 d Difference -1.12 ± 0.73 -0.34 ± 0.41 -0.77 (-1.02, -0.53) <0.001 * 1.31 d 1 p VAS d The secondary outcome was the change in the thickness of A1 pulley, and it was found to be more subsided in the steroid group than the percutaneous release group (−0.34 ± 0.24 versus − 0.21 ± 0.21), with a p p 2 Regarding the complication of the treatment, seven patients of the steroid group showed the failure of treatment and they needed the re-intervention, which is significant with a p 3 Table 3 Comparison of functional movement measured with Quinnel’s grading system between the steroid group and percutaneous release group Variables Steroid group n Percutaneous release group n P Effect size n (%) n (%) Baseline Quinnell score Grade 2 15 (33) 10 (22) 0.24 0.1 r Grade 3 31 (67) 36 (78) Endline Quinnell score Grade 0 7 (15) 22(49) <0.001* 0.43 r Grade 1 25 (54) 21(47) Grade 2 7 (15) 2(4) Grade 3 5 (11) 0 Grade 4 2 (5) 0 Re-intervention No 39 (85) 45 (100) 0.001** 0.29 φ Yes 7 (15) 0 (0) *denotes the significant for Mann Whitney U test, p r **denotes the significant for chi square test, p φ Discussion This study aimed to compare the effect of percutaneous release of the A1 pulley with steroid injection in trigger fingers. This study found better results in functional movement in the percutaneous release treatment arm than that of the steroid injection group, measured with Quinnell’s classification approach, which is consistent with the findings of this study [ 52 11 53 54 55 3 23 56 57 Another primary outcome was to measure the improvement in pain in both groups and found that percutaneous release has a greater reduction of pain than that of steroid injection, consistent with several studies [ 22 24 58 3 59 60 The secondary outcome was to find out the changes in the thickness of the A1 pulley and its tendon. Both the A1 pulley and the tendon thickness decreased more in steroid injection treatment than in percutaneous release treatment, especially massively decreased in the case of the tendon sheath. Kim et al. (2015) mention about its reason that inflammatory changes are localized specifically to the tendon sheath [ 61 62 41 63 64 65 This study found that seven patients faced with no improvement in steroid group and they needed re-intervention while all of the patients got improved well and no one needed re-intervention in percutaneous release group. Benan et al. 2012 have revealed the success rate of steroid injection is about 66 to 68% [ 16 66 This study has some limitations. First, although the measurements were standardized and performed by the principal investigator, the lack of blinding during outcome assessment could introduce potential observer bias. Second, while the study included a moderate sample size of 92 participants, the findings may not be generalizable to broader populations due to its single-center design. Third, the six-month follow-up period may not fully capture long-term structural or functional changes in the A1 pulley and tendon sheath. Fourth, the use of ultrasonography, though non-invasive and practical, may be subject to inter-operator variability. Finally, the study was conducted at a super-specialty hospital, where most patients were either referral cases or self-referred cases, and some may have already received treatment with various non-invasive methods, which could affect the outcome. However, we tried to find out whether they had previous treatment or not on the basis of the patient record. If we found such cases, we excluded them. We could not evaluate pain, activity level and patient satisfaction at six months as performed by [ 67 41 9 68 69 This study has some specific strengths. First, we assessed the thickness of the A1 pulley and tendon both before the intervention (baseline) and at a six-month follow-up, an approach not reported in previous studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the effects of percutaneous A1 pulley release and steroid injection on changes in the thickness of the A1 pulley and tendon sheath as post-treatment outcomes. Second, all interventions were performed by pre-assigned orthopedic surgeons, and evaluations were conducted solely by the principal investigator, which likely helped minimize measurement and performance bias. Conclusion Percutaneous release of A1 pulley illustrated greater improvement in functional mobility with a moderate effect and pain reduction with a large effect compared to steroid injection. Likewise, all participants in the percutaneous release group showed symptomatic improvements, whereas approximately 15% of those in the steroid group needed re-intervention. The steroid injection group exhibited a greater reduction in the thickness of the A1 pulley and tendon sheath than the percutaneous A1 pulley release group, suggesting that the pulley thickness may not be directly related to clinical outcome. Further multi-center trials with larger sample sizes and diverse participant populations are recommended to strengthen the evidence in this area.
