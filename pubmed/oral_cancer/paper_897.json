Introduction The incidence of gout, a common metabolic disease, has significantly increased worldwide in recent years [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Although some achievements have been made in medical research exploring the pathogenesis of gout, many key links remain unclear. Research has shown that the deposition of urate crystals in joints and surrounding tissues is the key starting factor for the induction of gout-related inflammatory reactions [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective gout treatment and prognosis improvement. Gout is clinically diagnosed by blood uric acid level detection, joint fluid puncture, and clinical manifestations [ 16 17 18 Nontargeted urine metabolomics, as a key branch of metabolomics, provides new hope and opportunities for the in-depth exploration of gout pathogenesis and the identification of early warning biomarkers [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 This study employed UHPLC-MS/MS to analyze the characteristics of urine metabolomics in healthy people (control), asymptomatic HUA patients, and AGA patients. The objectives were as follows: (1) to explore the differences of urine metabolomics among the three groups; (2) to elucidate previously unrecognized metabolic pathways implicated in gout pathogenesis; and (3) to identify highly specific and sensitive urinary biomarkers for the early detection of gout. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants and Study Design Urine samples were collected from 69 individuals in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Air Force Medical Center. Among these 69 individuals, 28 were healthy people, 13 were asymptomatic HUA patients, and 29 were AGA patients. HUA and AGA patients had no other diseases and had not been treated clinically. Urine samples were collected at the early stage of the disease. Clinicians classified all urine according to the diagnostic results. Fresh midstream urine samples were collected from each participant in the morning. The urine samples were centrifuged at 4 °C and 1000× g Figure 1 2.2. Sample Treatment A total of 100 µL of each urine sample was placed in an EP tube. Next, 400 μL of 80% methanol aqueous solution was added. The mixture was vortexed and allowed to stand in an ice bath for 5 min. The mixture was subsequently centrifuged at 15,000× g 2.3. UHPLC-MS/MS A ThermoFisher Vanquish UHPLC instrument equipped with a Hypes IL Gold column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.9 μm) was used to separate the urine samples. Mobile phase A was an aqueous solution containing 0.1% formic acid. Mobile phase B was methanol. The elution method was as follows: 0–1.5 min, 2–2% B; 1.5–3 min, 2–85% B; 3–10 min, 85–100% B; 10–10.1 min, 100–2% B; and 10.1–12 min, 2–2% B. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min. The injection volume was 10 µL. The column temperature was stable at 40 °C. Detection was performed in positive and negative ion modes using the heated electrospray ion source of a Q Exactive HF/Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer. The sheath gas flow rate was 35 psi. The flow rate of auxiliary gas was 10 L/min. The spray voltage was 3.5 kV. The temperature of the ion transport tube was 320 °C. The S-lens RF level of ion introduction was 60. The auxiliary gas heater temperature was 350 °C. In Full scan mode, the scanning range was 100–1500 Da, the resolution was 60,000 fwhm, the AGC was 3 × 10 6 5 2.4. Data Preprocessing and Metabolite Identification The data obtained from UHPLC-MS/MS detection were imported into the Compound Discoverer 3.3 database search software to screen each metabolite’s retention time and mass–charge ratio. The first quality control (QC) sample was used to correct the peak area, making the identification result more accurate. Peak extraction was performed with a mass deviation of 5 ppm, a signal intensity deviation threshold of 30%, and a minimum signal intensity of 100,000, while incorporating adduct ion forms and excluding isotopic peaks. The peak area was quantified, and the target ions were integrated. The molecular formula was subsequently predicted using molecular ion peaks and fragment ions and compared with the mzCloud, mzVault, and Masslist databases. A blank sample was used to remove background ions. The original quantitative results were standardized according to the following formula to obtain the relative peak area: original quantitative value of samples/(total quantitative value of metabolites in samples/total quantitative value of metabolites in QC1 samples). The compounds with relative peak area CVs greater than 30% in the QC samples were filtered out. Finally, the metabolites were identified and quantified. 2.5. Statistical Analysis The metabolites identified above were annotated using the KEGG, HMDB, and LIPID MAPS databases. The MetaX v2.87 software was used to convert the data, and then principal component analysis (PCA) and PLS-DA were used to obtain the variable importance in projection (VIP) value of each metabolite. The statistical significance ( p p 3. Results 3.1. Clinical Characteristics of the Participants The clinical characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 1 3.2. Quality Control of Metabolomics Data Using UHPLC-MS/MS Metabolic groups are easily disturbed by external factors and change rapidly. In particular, the sample size is large and sample detection can be a lengthy process. Whether the stability of the instrument and the signal response are normal in the process of metabolite detection is particularly important. Therefore, data QC is necessary to obtain stable and accurate metabolomic results. We prepared QC samples by mixing control, HUA, and AGA samples and inserted them into the sample analysis sequence for detection. QC sample correlation analysis and population sample PCA were used to control the data quality. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the QC samples was calculated according to the relative quantitative values of the metabolites. The R2 value between the QC samples was greater than 0.97 in both positive and negative ion modes ( Figure 2 Figure 2 3.3. Metabolite Analysis We used positive and negative ion ionization modes to perform UHPLC-MS/MS to identify metabolites to the greatest extent possible. A total of 727 and 362 metabolites were identified in positive and negative ion mode, respectively ( Tables S1 and S2 Figure S1A Figure S1B The identified metabolites were annotated using the KEGG, HMDB, and LIPID MAPS databases to understand the functional characteristics and classification of different metabolites ( Figures S2–S4 Figure S5A 3.4. Screening of Differential Metabolites PLS-DA is a supervised statistical method of discriminant analysis that uses partial least squares regression to establish a relationship model between the expression of metabolites and sample categories to predict sample categories. PLS-DA analysis was conducted on the positive and negative combined metabolic spectra of the HUA vs. control, AGA vs. control, and AGA vs. HUA groups ( Figure 3 We randomly scrambled the grouping labels of each sample before modeling and forecasting. Each model corresponded to a set of R2 and Q2 values. According to the Q2 and R2 values after 200 perturbations and modeling, regression lines were obtained to check whether the PLS-DA model was overfitted ( Figure 3 Y The contribution degree (VIP value) of each metabolite obtained from the PLS-DA model combined with the fold change (FC) and the p p Figure 3 Tables S3–S5 3.5. Differential Metabolite Analysis To study the change trend of the abovementioned screened differential metabolites in the control, HUA, and AGA groups, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. The differences in metabolic expression patterns between and within groups were determined ( Figure 4 Through Venn diagram analysis, two core metabolites were found to be regulated in the HUA vs. control, AGA vs. control, and AGA vs. HUA groups ( Figure 4 Table 2 Figure S5 Table 2 Figure S5B,C 3.6. KEGG Analysis of Differential Metabolites The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is a powerful tool for metabolic analysis and network research in organisms. A KEGG classification diagram was constructed according to the differential metabolites among the control, HUA, and AGA groups ( Figure 5 p p Figure 5 Table S6 22 21 31 Because caffeine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism have been previously reported, we focused on the four newly discovered pathways. Figures S6–S9 Table S4 3.7. Early Warning Biomarkers of Gout To verify the reliability of the differential metabolites obtained by multivariate and univariate statistical analysis as biomarkers, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the accuracy of potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of AGA vs. HUA and AGA vs. control groups. ROC curves can reflect the relationship between the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of potential biomarkers. The abscissa represents 1-specificity, and the ordinate represents sensitivity. The larger the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is, the greater the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers will be. When the AUC was ≤0.5, the biomarker had no predictive value. The closer the AUC value was to one, the higher the accuracy of prediction was. When the AUC value was 0.5–0.7, the prediction accuracy was low. When the AUC value was 0.7–0.9, it had a certain prediction accuracy. When the AUC value was above 0.9, the prediction accuracy was high. The differential metabolites in the AGA vs. control and the AGA vs. HUA groups were analyzed by ROC curves, and the AUC values of oxoamide, 3-methylindole, and palmitic acid were greater than 0.85 ( Figure 6 Figure 6 31 32 33 20 4. Discussion In this study, the urinary metabolomes of healthy people, asymptomatic HUA patients, and AGA patients were systematically analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS technology. Based on PLS-DA analysis and the criteria of variable importance projection (VIP > 1), fold change (FC > 1.5 or <0.67), and statistical significance ( p p −9 Table 1 34 35 p −4 p −6 36 We identified seven metabolic pathways significantly dysregulated during gout progression. Among these, caffeine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism have been previously implicated in gout [ 21 22 31 31 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 + + + + 44 45 While previous investigations by Wang et al. [ 46 37 To sum up, this study describes the dynamic metabolic profiles of gout progression using untargeted urine metabolomics, identifying four novel dysregulated pathways and three high-efficacy predictive biomarkers. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for advancing understanding of gout pathogenesis and developing non-invasive diagnostic strategies. Limitations include the cohort’s modest sample size, relatively single sampling source, unvalidated biological functions of the identified pathways in experimental models, and the absence of external biomarker validation in independent cohorts. Future research should establish multi-center prospective cohorts, incorporate gender-balanced design, elucidate pathway mechanisms, and integrate multi-omics validation to translate these discoveries into clinical early-warning tools, ultimately improving long-term outcomes and quality of life in gout patients. 5. Conclusions In this study, we employed nontargeted urine metabolomics to systematically characterize dynamic metabolic alterations during the progression from healthy people to AGA via HUA. A total of 278 differential metabolites were identified in urine profiles across the three cohorts. Notably, the number of specific differential metabolites distinguishing AGA patients from healthy people significantly exceeded those differentiating other groups, indicating profound metabolic pathway remodeling during AGA development. KEGG pathway analysis revealed four gout disturbance pathways for the first time in urine: histidine metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism. These findings provide new evidence suggesting the involvement of neural–endocrine–immune network imbalance and energy metabolism dysregulation in gout. Furthermore, we identified three highly specific urinary biomarkers for AGA via ROC analysis: oxoamide, 3-methylindole, and palmitic acid. Their gradient changes across the disease continuum position them as promising non-invasive tools for early gout detection. In summary, this study delineates urinary metabolic alterations associated with gout progression, where the identification of novel pathways and a highly specific biomarker panel not only elucidates gout pathogenesis but also facilitates early diagnosis and targeted intervention.
