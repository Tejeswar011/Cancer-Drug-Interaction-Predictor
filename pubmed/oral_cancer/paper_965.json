Introduction Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent global health condition that contributes to diverse and significant health complications [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Currently, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) are the gold standards for prediabetes screening [ 8 9 10 11 Progranulin, the precursor of the glycoprotein granulin, has been identified as an adipokine closely linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 In the present study, we investigated the relationships between granulin levels and different glycemic statuses in a clinical population. The participants had either normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or newly diagnosed diabetes (NDD). By comparing the serum granulin concentrations between groups, we sought to determine whether this measurement could serve as a potential biomarker for prediabetes screening. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population The participants in this case–control study were screened between February 2019 and July 2022 following a routine physical examination. All patient samples were deidentified and the subjects provided informed consent prior to their participation. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were adults aged 18 years or older and provided informed consent to participate in the study. Individuals were excluded if they had a history of alcohol consumption exceeding 20 g per day within the previous year; tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody; had laboratory evidence of other liver diseases, including autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, Wilson’s disease, hemochromatosis, or other hepatic malignancies; had a serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 mg/dL; were pregnant; or had a diagnosis of advanced malignant disease. A total of 180 participants were enrolled and classified into four groups: normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n n n n Each participant was evaluated with a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association. On the basis of the test results, patients were grouped as follows: NGT if fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was <5.6 mmol/L and the 2 h plasma glucose was <7.8 mmol/L without a history of diabetes; IFG if FPG was 5.6–6.9 mmol/L and the 2 h plasma glucose was <7.8 mmol/L; IGT if FPG was <5.6 mmol/L and the 2 h plasma glucose was 7.8–11.1 mmol/L; and NDD if FPG was ≥7.0 mmol/L or the 2 h plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L [ 8 2.2. Clinical Variables Body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 19 Blood pressure was measured following a conventional attended office protocol. The participants were seated and rested for at least five minutes before measurement. Two consecutive readings were taken, and the mean of the two readings was used for subsequent analyses. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 80 mmHg [ 20 21 Plasma concentrations of high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP were measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay kits (intra-assay CV < 2.9%, inter-assay CV < 4.7%; Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Newberg, OR, USA). Serum insulin was measured with an ultrasensitive ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index as fasting insulin (μU/mL) × FPG (mmol/L)/22.5 [ 22 The serum granulin concentration was measured by commercial ELISA kits (intra-assay CV = 5.21%, inter-assay CV = 4.95%; FineTestBiotech, Wuhan, China). 2.3. Statistical Analysis All the statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software, version 27.0. Normally distributed continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Chi-squared tests were used for comparisons of categorical variables, whereas one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to assess differences in continuous variables across groups. Scheffe’s method was used for post hoc analysis to identify significant differences between groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the factors independently associated with granulin levels. The beta coefficient and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported as standardized estimates. Multiple comparisons were performed to assess the independent associations between variables and granulin levels. Statistical significance was defined as p 3. Results One-hundred-and-eighty participants were classified into four groups. The baseline characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1 p p p p p p The NDD group showed significantly higher levels of fasting plasma glucose, hs-CRP, and HOMA-IR compared to the other groups. Conversely, HDL was highest in the NGT group, while the IFG group had the highest creatinine levels. Serum granulin concentrations were significantly greater in the IFG ( p p p p p p Figure 1 To further elucidate the independent factors associated with serum granulin concentrations, we conducted a multivariate linear regression analysis. A consistent model was obtained using both stepwise and backward selection strategies, which is presented in Table 2 p p p p p The analysis of the ROC curve revealed a statistically significant correlation between granulin levels and participant glycemic status (prediabetes and newly diagnosed diabetes) ( Figure 2 p 4. Discussion In this study, our results revealed a previously undescribed relationship between granulin levels and glycemic status in individuals with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes and diabetes. Compared with those in controls, granulin levels were significantly elevated in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes. In the multiple linear regression analysis, both obesity (β = 29.68, [95% CI = 1.49, 57.87]; p p In our method design, we adopted the Taiwan-specific BMI criteria for obesity (BMI ≥ 27.0) instead of the WHO guideline. This was to better reflect the unique characteristics of the local population, as this criterion is more sensitive for identifying obesity-related risks in Taiwan. We initially included BMI as a continuous variable in a multiple regression analysis. However, the association with our outcome reached a borderline statistical significance ( p p p −6 Early detection of prediabetes is a crucial public health concern given the increasing prevalence of diabetes and its associated complications. Although HbA1c is a widely used and convenient diagnostic tool, there is no consensus on an optimal cutoff value for prediabetes screening [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 Previous studies have shown that progranulin is associated with inflammatory responses and plays a role in the development of T2DM and obesity [ 29 30 31 32 30 33 30 32 33 34 35 36 29 37 Our data showed that obesity was independently associated with granulin concentration after adjustment for confounding factors, and that granulin levels were significantly associated with glycemic status. These findings are in line with the idea that granulin may contribute to the development of obesity and diabetes through inflammatory mechanisms. Given the role of progranulin and granulin in the inflammatory cascade, our findings suggest that granulin may mediate inflammation-induced metabolic dysfunction. This study has several limitations. First, its cross-sectional design precludes causal inference. Although we observed an association between serum granulin and glycemic status, it remains uncertain whether elevated granulin contributes to diabetes pathogenesis or merely reflects metabolic dysregulation. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this relationship. Second, generalizability may be limited, as participants were recruited from a single medical center in Taiwan and consisted exclusively of an Asian population. Recruitment through a health screening program may also introduce selection bias. Validation in larger, multicenter cohorts with diverse populations is therefore required. Third, residual confounding from unmeasured factors cannot be excluded. Detailed dietary patterns, physical activity, socioeconomic status, and genetic predispositions were not assessed and may have influenced the observed associations. Finally, future in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to elucidate the physiological role of granulin and define its clinical value in risk stratification or disease monitoring. 5. Conclusions This study demonstrated that serum granulin levels are significantly elevated in individuals with IFG, IGT, and diabetes, suggesting its potential as a novel biomarker for prediabetes screening. A serum granulin cutoff value of 218.09 ng/mL was identified, providing a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 70.2% for detecting prediabetes.
