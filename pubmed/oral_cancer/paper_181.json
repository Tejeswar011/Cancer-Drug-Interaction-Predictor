Objective Gout is a condition strongly associated with dietary patterns and elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in affected individuals. Given the potential influence of dietary diversity on inflammatory responses, this study aimed to explore the association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and CVD prevalence in gout patients. Methods Data from gout patients in NHANES 2007–2018 were extracted for analysis. Correlation matrices were employed to examine the relationships among 28 dietary inflammation indices. Machine learning algorithms were utilized to identify key features for constructing a covariate subset for the final model, and Random Forest SHAP interpretations were applied to assess variable risk factors. The relationship between DII and CVD risk in gout patients was assessed using multi-model logistic regression. RCS were applied to evaluate the risk trend and to assess model discrimination, predictive probability, and clinical benefit using ROC, calibration curves, and DCA, respectively. Subgroup analysis was evaluated the heterogeneity in CVD across different populations. Results 1,437 gout patients met inclusion criteria were included in the study, with mean age of 60.84 years, consisting of 435 females (31.23%) and 1,002 males (68.77%), and an overall CVD prevalence of 32.92%. DII was linearly associated with CVD risk ( P P p p p Conclusion Higher DII was associated with increased prevalence of CVD in gout patients. Dietary modification may serve as an effective strategy for preventing disease progression and reducing CVD risk.

Machine learning algorithms were employed to construct models for exploring and analyzing the potential association between DII and CVD risk in gout. This study aims to assist clinicians in more accurately assessing CVD risk in gout patients, identifying those at high risk, and providing a foundation for effective disease management strategies. Study population Data from the NHANES, a multi-institutional series designed to assess the health and nutritional status of both adults and children in the U.S. The survey protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). All participants provided written informed consent, ensuring the study’s ethical compliance. Data for this study were obtained from the official NHANES website, ensuring data transparency and accessibility. Data from 6 NHANES cycles conducted between 2007 to 2018 were included in this study, which initially screened 59,842 participants. Strict exclusion criteria were applied to maintain the rigor of the study design. A total of 44,562 ineligible participants were excluded, including those younger than 20 years ( n n n n n Figure 1 Figure 1 Flowchart of participant screening and technology roadmap. Flowchart depicting participant selection and analysis process from NHANES 2007-2018 data. Out of 59,842 participants, exclusions include age, pregnancy, and missing information, resulting in 1,437 gout participants. The process involves baseline characteristics, machine learning screening, logistic regression models, and subgroup analysis, linked to various tables and figures for detailed data presentation. Definition of gout The diagnosis of gout was based on a self-reported physician’s diagnosis, with participants being asked, “doctor ever told you that you have gout?” If a participant answered “yes,” they were considered to have the condition ( 21 Definition of cardiovascular disease The diagnosis of CVD was established through self-reported physician diagnoses obtained via an individual interview using a standardized medical condition questionnaire. CVD was defined as self-reported physician diagnoses of CHF, CHD, angina, MI, or stroke. If a participant answered “yes,” they were considered to have the condition ( 22 Definition of dietary inflammation index 45 specific foods and nutrients were associated with various inflammatory or anti-inflammatory biomarkers, and the inflammatory potential of each dietary component was scored based on biomarkers, including CRP, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α 15 16 23 24 The NHANES collected dietary information via 24 h dietary recall interviews conducted at mobile examination center (MEC). Two 24 h dietary recall interviews were used to calculate DII for each participant. However, due to missing nutrient data in the NHANES dietary database ( 25 β Covariates in NHANES Covariates for this cross-sectional study included demographic data from NHANES 2007–2018, physical examination results, laboratory examinations, and questionnaire data. These covariates included information on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, smoke, drink, sleep disorder, 12 self-reported comorbidities, and 21 laboratory examinations. Drink status was defined as “had drink more than 12 times in the past year” or “drink more than once a month,” and smoke status as “had smoke more than 100 cigarettes in lifetime” or “current smoke.” Hypertension was defined as “systolic blood pressure average (SBP Avg) ≥ 135 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure average (DBP Avg) ≥ 85 mmHg, ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that had hypertension, or taking prescription for hypertension”. According to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, participants with fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, 2 h blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL on the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% were defined as having diabetes ( 26 27 Statistical analysis The baseline study population across 6 cycles was weighted according to the statistical methods recommended by NHANES analysis guidelines. Missing data were imputed using simple interpolation, with no more than 20% of model variables missing. In the descriptive analysis, continuous variables were expressed as means with standard error (SE), while categorical variables were presented as frequencies. The Chi-square test was used for categorical data, and the t-test was applied to continuous variables for group comparison. Correlation matrix was plotted to show the relationship among the 28 DIIs. Important features were selected using the Boruta and Random Forest algorithms to construct a subset of covariates for the final model, and risk measures of the assessment variables were interpreted using Random Forest SHAP. Gout patients were grouped according to DII quartiles for logistic regression analysis. RCS was applied to validate the risk trend, and discrimination, predictive probability, and clinical benefit were assessed using ROC, calibration curves, and DCA, respectively. Segmented subgroup analysis was performed to assess the heterogeneity of CVD occurrence across different populations. Statistical analysis and data visualization were conducted using SPSS 27.0.1, R-studio 4.4.2 and DCPM 6.03.1. p Results Baseline characteristics of study population The baseline characteristics of the study population, which included 1,437 gout participants with mean age of 60.84 years, 435 females (31.23%) and 1,002 males (68.77%) were presented in Table 1 p Table 1 Basic characteristics of participants in gout.

Key adjustment variables were screened using machine learning algorithms, revealing a significant positive association between DII and the prevalence of CVD in patients with gout, characterized by a significant linear relationship. Evaluation of the model performance indicated that the fully adjusted model exhibited higher accuracy and discriminative ability. Differences in the risk of CVD in gout patients were observed based on gender and age, but the results remained stability. DII is an important indicator of dietary regulation of body inflammation, reflects the impact of food components on inflammatory cells, the regulation of oxidative stress, and inflammation mediated by intestinal flora ( 28 29 α 30 32 33 The male-to-female prevalence ratio of gout was 2.2:1, and the overall prevalence of CVD was 32.92%, with male-to-female prevalence ratio of approximately 2.3:1. A study conducted at the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom, enrolled 152,663 patients with gout, of whom 120,324 (78.8%) were male. This study found that the risk of CVD was increased by 58% among gout patients compared to the healthcare group (HR 1.88, 95% CI: 1.75–2.02), and 58% increase in the risk of CVD was observed in female with gout (HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.75–2.02), despite the higher proportion of male in the cohort ( 34 35 DII and the risk of CVD development were positively and linearly correlated. A review of the literature indicates that DII is positively associated with the development of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperuricemia, which are potential risk factors for CVD ( 17 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 We found that the risk of CVD was higher in young and middle-aged gout patients with elevated DII compared to older patients in our subgroup analysis. Gout typically manifests at a younger age in the affected population. Studies have found that the prevalence of gout in males is 2.9 times higher than in females across all age groups, peaking at 7.3 times between the ages of 30 to 34 years ( 44 35 45 46 47 p 48 Our study was based on the analysis of U.S. national data with a large, representative sample size, the screening of covariates through machine learning algorithms, and multiple modeling and subgroup analyses. We adhered strictly to the STROBE statement, ensuring the stabilition and reliability of the results. However, the cross-sectional nature of the study presented limitations, including the lack of regular laboratory examinations reviews for the participants and the absence of follow-up on disease progression, as well as the absence of stratified analysis of different types of drug interventions introduced to the participant population, which precluded establishing causality. DII as a complex dietary inflammation-weighting algorithm, may be influenced by confounding factors such as food and water quality. Future clinical patient-based longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials will further clarify the association between the DII and the development of CVD in gout patients, providing stronger evidence for its use in predicting the risk of CVD in this population. Conclusion Our study suggests a positive, linear association between DII and CVD, as well as its subtypes in gout patients. The predictive performance for CVD and its subtypes was superior in a fully adjusted logistic regression model constructed with machine learning to select variables. Gout patients with high DII and younger age had increased risk of CVD. Future large-scale longitudinal cohort studies are needed to investigate and validate whether a causal relationship exists between DII and CVD, including its subtypes, in gout patients or other populations. The results of this study provide clinicians with both a theoretical and data-driven foundation for the early identification, prevention, and management of CVD in gout patients.
