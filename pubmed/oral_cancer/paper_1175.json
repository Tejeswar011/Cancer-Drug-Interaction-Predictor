It has become the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with an estimated 9.3% of the global population currently affected. Recent epigenetic studies have shown that variations such as DNA methylation and histone modifications are implicated in the development of T2DM. However, epigenetically related conditions are known to be reversible, which could potentially pave the way for predicting and treating T2DM. This has led to the development of epigenetic modifier drugs, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi), protein arginine methyltransferase inhibitors (PRMTi), DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), histone demethylating inhibitors (HDMi), and sirtuin-activating compounds (STAC). A major challenge with these epigenetic drugs is that only a few have been approved for treating metabolic diseases due to their potential to negatively impact off-target genes. The low specificity of these drugs can lead to side effects and increased toxicity, contributing to complex diseases such as cancer. Hence, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying metabolic diseases can provide new insights and strategies for preventing, diagnosing, and treating metabolic disorders, such as T2DM. This review summarizes the epigenetic variations in T2DM, pharmaco-epigenetics, and the challenges surrounding epigenetics. This provides basic insight into the discovery of novel drug targets, which can lead to the development of epigenetic therapies for T2DM. Hence, the reversible nature of epigenetic variations retains hope for future novel strategies to combat T2DM. diabetes mellitus epigenetics epi-drugs DNA methylation histone modifications College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa S.S.M. received funding from the College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction People of all ages are increasingly affected by diabetes mellitus (DM) due to insufficient insulin action and secretion [ 1 2 3 4 It is essential to highlight that DM mostly results from insufficient insulin synthesis or impaired insulin sensitivity. Hence, it can be categorized into various forms, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Research has shown that the rise in T2DM prevalence is strongly associated with the worldwide increase in obesity since it affects both insulin and beta cell function [ 12 13 14 Figure 1 13 Among these, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to the DNA molecule, typically at cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes [ 13 14 16 KCNQ1 16 17 17 18 This has led to the development of epigenetic drugs and epigenetic programs, which can effectively reverse epigenetic and transcriptional aberrations present in various diseases [ 19 20 21 22 21 Therefore, it becomes essential to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms that occur in response to epigenetic therapies and epigenetic variation in DM, particularly T2DM, and to gain insights into the challenges surrounding epigenetics. This review aimed to summarize the epigenetic changes that occur due to epigenetic therapies and understand the pharmacogenetic interaction. This would assist in understanding the underlying genes that get silenced and activated through epigenetic therapy. This could serve as a starting point for developing therapeutic derivatives against T2DM and obesity with minimal side effects. 2. Epigenetic Variation in T2DM, Drug Treatment, and Drug Response Epigenetics is one of the most rapidly advancing fields in biology. It encompasses changes in gene expression that arise from chemical modifications of DNA and its associated proteins, without altering the underlying DNA sequence [ 23 24 25 26 23 27 It is essential to emphasize that epigenetic modifications, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), are potentially reversible and can have enduring effects on gene expression [ 28 23 23 Figure 1 29 Interestingly, epigenetics has been recognized as one of the medical research areas that promises to influence disease development and management by individuals [ 30 31 32 33 32 Researchers have indicated that a healthy diet can beneficially influence the epigenetic profile of individuals. Hence, previous data have indicated that individuals who are non-diabetic with average body weight have a distinct epigenetic profile when compared to obese and diabetic individuals [ 34 35 36 37 38 2.1. Epigenetic Variation in T2DM Epigenetic variation influences gene expression and protein synthesis [ 39 40 41 42 43 44 42 Generally, DNA methylation and histone modifications are considered the primary epigenetic mechanisms contributing to metabolic disorders [ 45 24 2.1.1. DNA Methylation The methylation of DNA has been the most well-researched epigenetic mechanism. It has been investigated in numerous organisms and linked to various biological processes such as gene regulation, genome organization, reproduction, disease development, and ageing [ 46 47 DNA methylation involves the covalent addition of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of the cytosine ring, resulting in the formation of 5-methylcytosine (5meC), or alternatively, the methylation of adenine at the sixth nitrogen of the purine ring. Specifically, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes catalyze the transfer of a methyl group (CH 3 Figure 2 48 It has been initially established that de novo DNA methylation is mediated by the enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which act predominantly at symmetrical CpG sites, and the methylation marks are subsequently maintained by DNMT1 during DNA replication, as illustrated in Figure 2 49 3 50 51 52 51 52 DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic process through which 5meC modifies gene activity [ 53 53 54 53 55 56 45 56 Figure 2 57 58 59 60 61 60 For instance, previous research has shown that DNA methylation negatively affects gene expression in individuals with T2DM, particularly in skeletal muscle and pancreatic islet cells [ 62 63 64 2.1.2. Histone Modifications Histones are proteins that bind and organize the DNA of eukaryotic cells. Hence, they are recognized as chromatin’s significant chief protein components [ 65 65 66 65 67 68 69 69 To name a few, there are numerous post-translational modifications, which include methylation (arginine and lysine), acetylation (lysine), ubiquitination (lysine), sumoylation (lysine), phosphorylation (serine, tyrosine, and threonine), ADP-ribosylation, and glycosylation that occur at the N-terminal tails of histones. These modifications change the functional properties and structure of chromatin; for example, they disrupt electrostatic interactions between histones and DNA, which affects chromatin compactness [ 70 71 Table 1 72 73 However, it is important to emphasize that the significance of alterations largely depends on the type, extent, and genomic location of the modification [ 74 75 76 77 78 79 79 Table 1 79 80 biomedicines-13-02278-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Histone modifiers (writers and erasers) and their associated modifications.

Similarly to acetylation, histone phosphorylation alters the charge of histone proteins by targeting the N-terminal tails, where amino acid residues such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine undergo phosphorylation [ 86 92 93 70 94 95 96 97 98 In contrast to the aforementioned modifications, histone methylation occurs on basic amino acid residues, primarily arginine, lysine, and histidine [ 99 76 100 101 102 103 76 104 105 106 2.2. Non-Epigenetic Drug Responsiveness Is Affected by Epigenetic Variation Epigenetic variation has been observed in close proximity to specific gene regulators and genes associated with drug metabolism [ 107 108 109 110 111 The epigenetic variations also have a significant role in epigenetic imprinting, such as drug metabolism. In fact, research by Nakajima et al. [ 112 113 114 115 116 117 2.3. Key Epigenetic Biomarkers Predict Diagnosis and Prognosis Further research into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying T2DM is essential to elucidate its pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets, as the disease has become increasingly complex due to the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors [ 102 118 Emerging evidence from Raciti et al. [ 119 120 121 121 122 It should be noted that epigenetic modifications, such as variations in DNA methylation, have been associated with numerous diseases, which include T2DM [ 123 124 DNA methylation is the potential ideal epigenetic biomarker since it is well understood and is highly useful in the analysis of human disease because it has proven to be stable over time and is simple to measure [ 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 2.4. Epigenetic Strategies for Diabetes In efforts to combat obesity and diabetes, recent research has focused on modulating disease-specific gene expression. This led to the development of epigenetic modifier drugs, such as histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi), DNMTi, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs), and histone demethylase inhibitors (HDMi) [ 135 136 136 137 138 One of the popular drugs for diabetes, metformin, causes a protective effect in vascular cells via glucose-lowering and pleiotropic effects that include DNA methylation. Metformin treatment typically results in a combination of hypo-, hyper-, and non-differential methylation patterns across CpG regions [ 139 140 SOD2 NF-κB 141 141 142 143 144 145 20 145 3. Combining Existing Pharmaco-Epigenetic Data to Explore Pharmaco-Epigenetic Correlations The advancement in epigenetics has influenced pharmacology to develop a new speciality, namely, pharmaco-epigenetics. Pharmaco-epigenetics deals with the study of heritable non-genetic variations in response to drugs and drug toxicity, together with their fundamental mechanisms [ 146 147 148 108 The research conducted by García-Calzón et al. [ 117 García-Calzón et al. [ 117 149 117 24 24 150 151 152 Besides the DNMTi drugs, other medications related to histone modification have been developed. These drugs include HDACi, HATi, and STAC, which have undergone different phases of approval, as observed in Table 2 24 24 HDACi have played a major role in treating diabetes by inhibiting hyperglycemia and reversing diabetes within the newly diagnosed non-obese diabetic mice [ 153 154 155 24 156 Table 2 157 However, it is crucial to emphasize that epigenetic therapy is emerging as a prospective treatment for a diverse array of diseases [ 158 24 138 Furthermore, it is acknowledged that epigenetic patents are increasingly progressing beyond fundamental laboratory techniques for detecting and modifying epigenetic changes, toward more advanced applications, including biological correlation studies, therapeutic interventions, and the archival of epigenetic data for future analysis. In contrast to patents that claim isolated DNA sequences, the majority of epigenetic patents are categorized as method-based claims [ 159 The epigenetic patents are currently recognized to be in the midst of evolution from basic laboratory techniques for detecting and modifying epigenetic changes, to methods of using those techniques to observe biological correlations, make therapeutic interventions, and store epigenetic data for subsequent retrieval and analysis. Unlike DNA sequence patents that claim isolated DNA molecules, most epigenetic patents are method patents [ 159 160 biomedicines-13-02278-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Various epigenetic drugs and their respective phases of clinical trials in the treatment of obesity and diabetes.

Combining Existing Pharmaco-Epigenetic Data to Explore the DNA Methylation Profile of CYP Genes Epigenetic drugs such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors have received significant attention, particularly in their application to the management of cancer [ 22 164 165 22 166 147 The CYP family of proteins contribute significantly to drug metabolism processes, and they have been known to have inter- and intra-individual variability in activity and expression. This inter- and intra-individual variability of action is caused by both genetic and non-genetic factors [ 108 167 168 169 170 170 170 171 172 171 173 174 175 108 5. Challenges in Pharmaco-Epigenetics Epigenetic drugs such as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase have been well researched, especially in their management of cancer [ 22 22 Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms/alterations have been observed to be linked with toxicological effects of drugs and chemicals or carcinogenicity [ 176 20 20 174 20 20 177 178 Above all, since the epigenetic mechanisms are reversible, it can be said that this phenomenon allows the establishment of new approaches for preventing and treating obesity and T2DM; nevertheless, it is still a challenge to find ways of converting basic research into clinical application [ 44 24 136 24 108 6. Conclusions and Future Perspectives Epigenetics offers valuable insights into the pathogenesis of complex diseases and holds promise for identifying biomarkers for diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapeutic targeting. Despite its potential, current epigenetic therapies face challenges such as low specificity and associated toxicity, which may lead to adverse effects [ 20 179 Given the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation, these marks present promising targets for the prediction, prevention, and treatment of complex diseases such as obesity and T2DM [ 33 145 180 While some epigenetic drugs have received FDA approval and show promise in treating diseases such as cancer [ 20 47 181 Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge the College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, for support and the opportunity to partake in the research project.
