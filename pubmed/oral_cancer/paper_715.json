FIPV is responsible for the severe disease known as feline infectious peritonitis, while FECV typically causes mild symptoms, such as diarrhea, and often does not lead to any disease at all. Currently, it is not possible to distinguish between FIPV and FECV at the molecular level. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular features of FIPV. Here, we generated a recombinant virus by replacing the ORF1ab region and the coding sequence for the spike (S) protein of an FECV with the corresponding sequences from FIPVs.

Introduction FCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Coronavirus of the Coronaviridae [ 1 2 3 4 Although low-pathogenicity FCoV is highly contagious, only a small percentage of infected cats develop clinical FIP, and only a few FIP-affected cats shed FIPV [ 5 2 4 4 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The mechanism underlying the development and pathogenesis of FIPV is not clear. Like all coronaviruses, the FCoV genome shows high genetic variability. It has been proposed that mutations in the spike (S) gene, along with accessory genes 3c and 7b, may play a role in this process [ 13 14 15 16 16 17 18 19 12 The currently accepted theory on the pathogenesis of FIPV suggests that when cats are infected with FCoV, the accumulation of viral genetic mutations alters the target cells of the virus from intestinal epithelial cells to monocytes/macrophages, leading to FIP development. However, others argue that FECV and FIPV are two distinct types of FCoV that circulate independently within cat populations [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 24 26 In this study, we constructed a recombinant virus of recFECV-S DF-2 FIPV pro 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cells, Viruses, and Antibodies Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) cells were purchased from National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (Shanghai, China; CAT#3101MAMGNO16). Felis catus whole fetus (Fcwf-4, CRL-2787) cells were obtained from ATCC. CRFK cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany; CAT#D6429-500ML) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Clark Bioscience, Richmond, VA, USA; CAT#FB25015) and 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; CAT#15140-122), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified air containing 5% ( v v 2 v v 2 v v 2 DF-2 27 The mouse-derived polyclonal antibody against FIPV N protein was prepared in this experiment. Monoclonal Anti-β-Actin antibody (CAT#A5441-100UL) and DAPI (CAT#D9542-5MG) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor™ 488 (CAT#A11001) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). IRDye ® ® ® 2.2. Rescue of the Recombinant Virus The FIPV ORF1ab sequence was synthesized based on the NCBI database sequence (HLJ/HRB/2016/10, ACC#: KY566209.1 28 DF-2 FIPV 27 29 30 31 32 33 34 2.3. Isolation and Culture of Feline BMDMs Feline bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated and cultured following established protocols from previous studies [ 23 24 25 6 2 2.4. Viral Growth Kinetics CRFK and BMDM cells were infected with the recFECV-S DF-2 FIPV 50 5 −1 −6 −1 50 mL 2.5. Immunofluorescence Assay The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after clear CPEs were observed, fixed at room temperature for 30 min, and then washed again and permeabilized using a 0.3% Triton X-100 solution for 5 min. They were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS buffer for 30 min before being stained with an anti-FCoV N antibody diluted to 1:1000 for 1 h. Following five more washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-M Alexa 488 and DAPI, both diluted to 1:1000, for 1 h. The cells were washed five additional times with PBS and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; EVOS FL Auto 2). 2.6. Electron Microscopy Identification The rescued virus was inoculated into CRFK cells at an MOI of 0.1. After 72 h, the cells were broken through two freeze–thaw cycles and centrifuged at 60,000× g g 2.7. Analysis of Gene Expression Using RT-qPCR Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Takara Bio Inc., Beijing, China; CAT#9109). The reverse transcription process was completed by HiScript II Q Select RT SuperMix for qPCR (+gDNA wiper) (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China; CAT#R233-01). Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using TB Green ® 24 2.8. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay CRFK cells were plated in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 10 5 35 ® 2.9. Transcriptomic Assay CRFK cells were infected with the recombinant viruses at 0.1 MOI for 16 h. Three replicates were prepared for each group. Then, the cells were washed three times with pre-cooled PBS, and treated with 1 mL Trizol until the cells were fully lysed. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to the transcriptomic analysis (Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Briefly, three μg total RNA was used for library preparation. Poly (A)-tailed mRNA was enriched, fragmented, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Purified double-stranded cDNA was repaired, adenylated, and ligated with adapters. Fragments with a size of 400–500 bp were selected, PCR-amplified, and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, CA, USA). The libraries were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and then sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform under PE150 mode. The high-quality clean reads were aligned to the reference genome ( https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/felis_catus/dna/Felis_catus.Felis_catus_9.0.dna.toplevel.fa.gz p p 2.10. Proteomic Assay CRFK cells were infected with the recombinant viruses at 0.1 MOI for 20 h and rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were collected by scraping and lysed by the SDT buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6). Three replicates were prepared for each group. The proteomic analysis was performed by Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Briefly, the lysates were boiled for 15 min. Following centrifugation at 14,000 g for 40 min, the supernatant was quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Kit. DTT was added to each sample to a final concentration of 40 mM and mixed at 600 rpm for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After cooling to room temperature, IAA was introduced at a final concentration of 20 mM to alkylate reduced cysteine residues, followed by a 30 min incubation in the dark. The samples were then transferred to 10 kDa Microcon filter units. Each sample was desalted using C18 cartridges (Empore™ SPE MCX, 30 μm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA), concentrated by vacuum centrifugation, and redissolved in 40 μL of 0.1% ( v v DIA data were processed using DIA-NN (version 1.8.1) with the following parameters: trypsin as the enzyme, a maximum of one missed cleavage, and carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. Oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were considered variable modifications. Protein identifications were filtered at a 1% FDR, which corresponds to 99% confidence. The resulting p t https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ 2.11. Western Blotting CRFK cells were infected with the rescued virus at an MOI of 0.1, and lysed with lysis buffer 24 h later. After electrophoresis, the protein gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies—anti-FCoV-N and anti-β-actin—each diluted at a ratio of 1:3000 for 1 h. The secondary antibody, anti-M-800, was applied at a dilution of 1:10,000 for another hour. After washing with TBST, imaging was performed using an Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA; Odyssey CLX). For the Western blotting of PL2 pro pro 2.12.

Discussion In feline populations, FECV is highly prevalent, primarily causing enteritis in juvenile cats while often remaining asymptomatic in adult cats. In contrast, FIPV occurs sporadically but can cause severe disease. Currently, the development of vaccines for FIP faces several challenges. Firstly, different serotype strains do not offer cross-protection, which limits the clinical efficacy of vaccines. Additionally, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) induced by the vaccines could worsen the disease [ 36 37 In this study, we found that the presence of the ORF1ab derived from an FIPV strain enhanced the immune suppression activity of the virus in both CRFK and Fcwf-4 cells. This finding provides new insights into the biological features of FIPV. A previous study revealed that interferon production is differentially induced when Fcwf-4 cells are infected with various virus strains. In that study, the virulent strains (79-1146, identical to DF-2 and UCD-1) exhibited stronger inhibitory effects on interferon expression, although an avirulent strain (79-1683) demonstrated a similar capability [ 25 In addition, it has been suggested that mutations in the FECV genome lead to biotype conversion of the virus [ 2 4 38 In previous studies, NSP1 and NSP5 of FIPV were shown to play important roles in evading the innate immune response [ 24 26 pro pro pro pro 39 40 pro pro In summary, we have successfully constructed a recombinant virus harboring the ORF1ab from a virulent FIPV strain. Our findings suggest that ORF1ab from FIPV possesses a unique feature related to immune suppression. It remains unclear why ORF1ab exhibits an enhanced inhibitory function in innate immune responses, especially since PL2 pro Acknowledgments The authors gratefully acknowledge Natalay Kouprina and Vladimir Larionov from the Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA, for kindly providing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v17091282/s1 DF-2 FIPV DF-2 DF-2 FIPV DF-2 DF-2 FIPV DF-2 DF-2 FIPV DF-2 Author Contributions Conceptualization, H.K. and H.J.; formal analysis, H.G.; investigation, H.G. and C.X.; resources, H.J.; writing—original draft preparation, H.G. and H.J.; writing—review and editing, H.K. and H.J.; supervision, H.J.; project administration, H.J.; funding acquisition, H.K.
