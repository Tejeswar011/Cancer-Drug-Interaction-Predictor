To evaluate changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disability in children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or polyarticular JIA treated with tocilizumab. Methods. Secondary analyses of two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous tocilizumab in children with active systemic JIA or polyarticular JIA were conducted. Patient-reported outcomes of disability (Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire [C-HAQ]), HRQoL (Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form 50 [CHQ-P50], health concepts, physical summary score [CHQ-P50-PhS], psychosocial summary score [CHQ-P50-PsS]), pain, and well-being (100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]) were measured at weeks 0 and 12 for systemic JIA, weeks 16 and 40 for polyarticular JIA, and week 104 for both JIA subgroups. Results. The trial included 112 patients with systemic JIA and 188 patients with polyarticular JIA. In patients with polyarticular JIA, the mean ± SD C-HAQ score decreased from 1.39 ± 0.74 at baseline to 0.67 ± 0.65 at week 16 ( P P P P Conclusion. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with significantly reduced disability and pain and improved HRQoL in patients with systemic JIA and polyarticular JIA. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
