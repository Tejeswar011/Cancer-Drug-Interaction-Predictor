Introduction Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major hepatitis virus. This infection is a serious global health problem, with 2 billion people infected worldwide and 350 million suffering from chronic HBV infection, although the incidence rate varies greatly between countries [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Many cellular proteins, especially secreted and cell surface proteins, are glycosylated and are known to be involved in the biological functions of cells [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 20 24 25 26 27 NTCP is a glycoprotein with four N-linked glycosylation sites [ 28 29 30 Pholiota squarrosa 31 PhoSL has been purified from edible mushrooms and has been confirmed to be non-toxic when administered intraperitoneally and orally to animals [ 32 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cells PXB cells were purchased from PhoenixBio (Hiroshima, Japan). These are fresh hepatocytes harvested from human hepatocyte chimeric mice by collagenase perfusion. The purity of human hepatocytes in PXB cells is approximately 93%, and the donor cells are derived from a 1-year-old Caucasian boy or a 12-year-old Caucasian girl. PXB cells were cultured in DMEM (nacalai-tesque, Kyoto, Japan) containing the following: 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) with 20 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA); 44 mM NaHCO 3 2 33 PhoSL was obtained from Dr. Y. Kobayashi (Mitsubishi Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) and Myristoylated PreS1 peptide (myrPreS1) was synthesized by Scrum (Tokyo, Japan) [ 34 2.2. Preparation of HBV Particles HepAD38.7 cells are a tetracycline-regulated HBV-producing cell line that use the Tet-Off system. To obtain HBV particles for HBV infection experiments, tetracycline was removed from the culture medium and HBV replication was induced in HepAD38.7 cells. The culture medium of confluent HepAD38.7 cells cultured without tetracycline was collected every week for 2 weeks, and HBV particles were precipitated by adding PEG 8000 (final concentration 6%) and allowing it to stand overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate was centrifuged, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), concentrated, and filtered through a 0.45 µm filter (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). HBV DNA was quantified by qPCR and adjusted to 10 7 2.3. Cytotoxicity Assay PXB cells seeded at 4 × 10 5 2 2.4. HBV Infection and HBe Antigen Measurement HBV stocks were prepared as previously described [ 35 5 7 For a negative control, medium replacement was performed after HBV infection, but no PhoSL was added. In an experiment to examine the concentration dependence of PhoSL, PXB cells were infected with HBV for one day, washed out with PBS, and then cultured for 12 days with medium containing 0, 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 µg/mL PhoSL, with the medium changed every three days. 2.5. Preparation of Extracellular HBV Particle-Associated DNA Extracellular core particle-associated HBV DNA was prepared as follows: 30% PEG8000 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the collected culture supernatant to a final concentration of 6%, and the mixture was mixed by end-over-end at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation at 8000× g g g g g 2.6. Preparation of Hirt DNA and Quantification of HBV DNA Copies Hirt DNA was isolated from HBV-infected PXB cells using a standard Hirt extraction method. Briefly, 350 µL of 1% SDS/TE was added to one well of cells and incubated for 10 min, and the lysate was scraped off with a pipette tip. Then, 50 µL of 0.5 M NaCl was then added to the lysate, which was then mixed and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 18,000× g g g g 3 g Extracellular and intracellular HBV DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. Quantification was performed by creating a standard curve using a dilution series of HBV DNA from 1.2 × 10 8 3 HBV cccDNA was quantified by digital PCR. The amount of RNase P gene was measured using the TaqMan RNase P control reagent kit (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) and used as an internal control. Digital PCR was performed using a QuantStudio Absolute Q Digital PCR System (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The primers used were as follows: Probe (FAM) 5′-CTGTAGGCATAAATTGGT-3′, cccDNA_Fwd: 5′-CGTCTGTGCCTTCTCATCTGC-3′, and cccDNA_Rev: 5′-GCACAGCTTGGAGGCTTGAA-3′. An HBV production suppression experiment was performed using PhoSL in HepG2.2.15 cells. Cells were seeded at 1 × 10 4 2.7. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as the mean ± SD, and significance was tested using Student’s t p 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. PhoSL Inhibited HBV Infection in Normal Human Hepatocytes in a Concentration-Dependent Manner When Administered Simultaneously with HBV Infection Figure 1 First, to examine the concentration dependence of PhoSL, PhoSL was allowed to coexist during HBV infection. In our previous study, we found that PhoSL inhibited HBV infection in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2-C4 cells. Therefore, to clarify whether PhoSL can also inhibit HBV infection in normal hepatocytes, we examined its effect using PXB cells. As shown in Figure 1 As shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 We also attempted to measure intracellular cccDNA to investigate the concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of PhoSL on HBV replication, and although the results were for n = 1, we were able to confirm a significant inhibitory effect comparable to the results of HBe antigen measurements. However, this is only the result when PhoSL coexists with HBV infection, and to predict the effect of PhoSL during natural HBV infection, it is necessary to take PhoSL continuously as a permanent preventive measure, which is not very realistic. If the infectious disease treatment effect of PhoSL can be confirmed after HBV infection, clinical application is expected. Therefore, using the same normal hepatic PXB cells, we investigated whether a therapeutic effect could be obtained by administering PhoSL for various periods starting one day after HBV infection. 3.2. PhoSL Suppressed HBeAg, Intra- and Extracellular HBV DNA, and cccDNA Production in a Treatment-Period-Dependent Manner, Even When Administered After HBV Infection Figure 2 Figure 2 To verify the feasibility of PhoSL therapy for patients with HBV infection, we used PXB cells to examine whether the administration of PhoSL after HBV infection has an infection-suppressing effect, using changes in HBe Ag production and extracellular HBV production as indicators. As shown in the results in Figure 2 Figure 2 We found that PhoSL, when administered simultaneously with HBV infection, reduced the efficiency of HBV infection into PXB cells. Based on the results of previous studies, this is thought to be due to inhibition of entry, but in this study, we found that, even when treated after HBV infection, the amount of extracellular HBeAg and HBV DNA was suppressed in a treatment-time-dependent manner. Previous studies have demonstrated that, even in the absence of HBV, PhoSL is internalized into cells, likely through binding to the core fucose of cell surface receptors [ 31 To determine whether this was due to the inhibition of extracellular secretion or intracellular replication, we measured the amount of intracellular HBV DNA and cccDNA. The results are shown in Figure 2 36 Figure 3 Figure 3 37 3.3. MyrPreS1 Peptide Did Not Affect the Amount of Extracellular HBeAg or the Amount of Intracellular and Extracellular HBV DNA and cccDNA Produced When Administered After HBV Infection Another possible pathway for the suppressive effect of PhoSL on extracellular HBeAg and HBV DNA levels observed after HBV infection is the suppression of reinfection. Therefore, we investigated the effect of myrPreS1, which is known to be able to suppress the reinfection pathway. Figure 4 As shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 38 39 A brief summary of the results of this study is shown in Graphical Abstract. PhoSL binds to the core fucose of NTCP receptor and HBV particles, inhibiting HBV entry into cells by steric hindrance. PhoSL taken up into cells by endocytosis together with HBV may also inhibit cccDNA synthesis by some mechanism. However, PhoSL does not appear to affect the secretory pathway of HBV particles after HBV mRNA synthesis at the late stage of infection. In this study, we demonstrated that PhoSL also has an inhibitory effect on HBV infection in normal hepatocytes. This inhibitory effect can suppress intracellular cccDNA levels in a time-dependent manner even when administered after HBV infection, and is therefore expected to have clinical applications in the future.
