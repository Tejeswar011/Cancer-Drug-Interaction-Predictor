A retrospective and prospective cohort study was conducted between January 2020 and March 2025 in 13 centers in Argentina. Hematologic diseases (HD) and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients who received ISA for IFI were included and followed for 12 weeks. Patients with proven and probable bIFIs and non-bIFIs were compared. One hundred and sixty-three patients were included. IFIs were classified as proven (13.5%), probable (26.9%) and possible (59.5%). Among 66 proven and probable IFIs, 53% were bIFIs, with aspergillosis and mucormycosis being the most common. Twenty-three (34.8%) patients had acute myelogenous leukemia, and 40.9% had received HCT. Forty-eight (72.7%) patients experienced neutropenia, with a median duration of 26 days (interquartile range [IQR] 16–44). Fluconazole and posaconazole were the most frequently received antifungal prophylaxis. ISA was prescribed as first-line therapy in 31 (46.9%) patients. The other 35 received ISA as a continuation therapy, mainly as a step-down therapy after liposomal amphotericin B. Four (6.1%) patients developed adverse effects, and one discontinued ISA.

Introduction Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a frequent complication in patients with hematologic diseases (HD) and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), with significant morbidity and mortality rates, as well as high healthcare costs [ 1 2 3 4 Patients with acute leukemia and prolonged neutropenia, as well as those with allogeneic HCT with high doses of corticosteroids, have an IFI incidence of 7–13.2% and 8.8–16%, respectively [ 1 2 3 5 Aspergillus Mucorales Fusarium 1 2 6 7 8 Candida 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 In this complex scenario, several antifungal drugs have proved effective for treating IFIs. ISA was approved for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis, based on the SECURE and VITAL trials [ 21 22 23 24 12 25 26 27 28 29 30 ISA has several advantages over VORI, including Mucorales 31 32 33 34 35 36 21 22 To the best of our knowledge, no multicenter studies have been published despite all the above mentioned advantages of ISA therapy for bIFIs. This study aimed to outline the use of ISA for the treatment of IFIs in patients with HD and HCT. We further aimed to describe and compare those who have proven and probable bIFI and non-bIFI in terms of ISA effectiveness and safety, and patients’ outcomes. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Setting, Patients and Study Design A retrospective and prospective observational multicenter study was performed in 13 referral teaching centers (8 private and 5 public) specialized in the management of patients with HD and HCT in Argentina. Adult patients (≥18 years of age) treated with ISA for IFIs and managed as inpatients or outpatients were included. The retrospective cohort comprised patients included from 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2024; however, all of them were treated and followed up by the Infectious Diseases physicians conducting the study. Patients from the prospective cohort were recruited from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025. For the total cohort, the following criteria were met: (a) patients presenting with HD or autologous and allogeneic HCT; (b) those treated with ISA for IFIs for at least 7 days; and (c) those followed until day 90 since the beginning of ISA or until the patient’s death, whichever occurred first. Patients were excluded in case of missing data that precluded the assessment of baseline, clinical, microbiological, treatment characteristics, and outcomes. Patients were identified through data files from the Infectious Diseases Services, which treat and follow up all patients with HD and HCT at each center. Data were obtained from direct patient care, medical records, and data from laboratory, microbiology, and pathology databases. Clinical, microbiological, diagnostic, treatment, and outcome variables from the total cohort were evaluated. In addition, these variables were compared between patients with proven and probable bIFIs and non-bIFIs. Patient data were recorded with RedCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) software (RedCap version 13.7.19) and the server hosting was provided by the Argentine Society of Infectious Diseases. The study was approved by the Ethics Committees from the different participating institutions, and patient informed consent was waived. 2.2. Definitions Proven, probable, and possible IFIs were defined according to the revised and updated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group EORTC/MSG criteria [ 37 3 Histoplasma bIFIs were defined according to the Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSG-ERC) and the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) [ 38 Risk factors for IFIs were considered and defined as follows: (a) neutropenia < 500 neutrophils/mm 3 3 39 40 The first-line antifungal treatment was selected by the investigator based on the suspicion or diagnosis of IFI according to published guidelines [ 12 13 14 15 25 Preemptive therapy was given to patients whose diagnosis was based on positive GM and/or pulmonary CT-scan imaging, while targeted therapy implied that the diagnosis was made by microscopic detection or culture of any mold or yeast in clinical samples. Favorable response to treatment was defined as absence of fever, improved signs and symptoms of the initial infectious source, decrease in GM index, and/or improved results in CT-scan imaging. Partial remission: improved signs and symptoms and imaging, though without resolution. Stable disease: improved signs and symptoms, though with no changes in imaging. Cure: clinical and imaging resolution. Unfavorable outcome was defined as the patient’s death during the follow-up. Attributable mortality was considered to be the patient’s death with no response to treatment and documented clinical, radiological, microbiological, or histological findings suggestive of active IFI. 2.3. Statistical Analysis The study population was characterized by descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, centrality (median) and dispersion (IQR) measures were used according to the distribution of variables. Categorical variables were analyzed using absolute frequency and percentage. Groups were compared using the U Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test or the chi-square test for categorical variables. For all tests, a 95% level of statistical significance was used. Analyses were performed with the SPSS (Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0, Armonk, NY, USA) software packages. 3. Results 3.1. Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients’ Cohort A total of 163 patients (126 retrospective and 37 prospective) diagnosed with IFI were included. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were the most frequent underlying diseases (96, 58.9%), and were active in 125 (76.6%). Forty-nine (30.1%) had undergone HCT, with allogeneic being the most common type. Thirteen (43.3%) and 7 (23.3%) of allogeneic HCT developed acute and chronic GvHD, respectively. From the total cohort, 63 (38.6%) patients presented with oral mucositis, and 10 (6.1%) HCT patients developed acute or chronic GvHD affecting the gastrointestinal tract. One hundred and thirty-two (80.9%) patients were neutropenic at the onset of IFI. Of them, 115 (87.1%) presented profound and prolonged neutropenia, with a median duration of 27 days (IQR: 16–47). The cohort comprised patients with increased risk factors for IFIs, with a median of 2 (IQR: 2–3). Patients’ baseline characteristics and risk factors are outlined in Table 1 Figure 1 Proven and probable IFIs were diagnosed in 66 (40.5%) patients and possible IFIs in 97 (59.5%). Ninety-two (56.4%) were bIFIs. The most common locations were lungs (147, 90.2%) and paranasal sinuses (23, 14.1%). Lung CT scan showed nodules in 89 (54.6%) and halo sign in 37 (22.7%). IFIs characteristics are depicted in Table 2 ISA treatment was prescribed as preemptive therapy in 136 (83.4%) and as targeted therapy in 29 (17.8%) patients. It was used as first-line therapy in 73 (44.8%) of all the patients, and 153 (93.8%) received it as monotherapy. Ten (6.1%) patients received ISA in combination with L-AmB. The other antifungal drugs used as first-line therapy (90 patients) were L-AmB (65, 72.2%), VORI (13, 14.4%), POSA (6, 6.7%), LC-AmB (4, 4.4%), caspofungin (1, 1.1%), and FLUCO (1, 1.1%). ISA administration route was oral (77, 47.2%), intravenous (IV) followed by oral (57, 34.9%), IV (27, 16.6%), and oral followed by IV (2, 1.2%), with a median duration of 90 days (IQR: 59–113). Five patients undergoing treatment with medication that interacts with POSA and VORI (venetoclax 2, sirolimus 2 and ponatinib 1) were therefore administered ISA. Seven (4.3%) patients developed related adverse effects (nausea 1, hepatobiliary abnormalities 6, rash 1, and shortened QTc 1), and only 1 (0.6%) had to discontinue ISA. One hundred and thirty (79.7%) patients achieved a favorable response at week 12 (cure 54.6%, partial remission 19.6%, and stable disease 5.5%). Overall mortality was 22.7%, and IFI-related mortality was 4.9%. Ninety-day overall mortality in patients with pulmonary vs. non-pulmonary locations was 23.2% vs. 18.4% ( p 3.2. Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients with Probable and Proven IFIs A total of 66 patients were diagnosed with proven and probable IFIs, and 35 (53%) of them were bIFIs. Both bIFIs and non-bIFIs patients had similar baseline characteristics regarding sex, Charlson score comorbidity index, underlying diseases, and disease status. Forty-eight (72.7%) patients had neutropenia, mostly profound and prolonged, with a median duration of 26 days (IQR: 16–44). The most common primary antifungal prophylaxis administered to bIFIs patients was FLUCO (13, 37.1%), followed by POSA (10, 28.6%). Baseline characteristics and the antifungal prophylaxis prescribed are outlined in Table 3 Invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis were the most frequent IFIs in both groups. We compared and contrasted IFI locations in non-bIFI and bIFI patients and found lungs in 26 (83.9%) vs. 27 (77.1%), p p The etiology and methodology used for the diagnosis of proven and probable IFIs are described in Table 4 ISA was prescribed as monotherapy in 62 (93.9%) patients and as first-line treatment in 31 (46.9%). In the bIFI group, 15 patients (42.9%) received ISA as first-line treatment. Ten (66.7%) were under prophylaxis with FLUCO, 2 (13.3%) with VORI, 2 (13.3%) with L-AmB, and 1 (6.7%) with LC-AmB. As a continuation treatment, it was used in 20 patients (57.1%). The reasons for prescribing ISA were step-down therapy after L-AmB in 11 (55%), (10 had undergone POSA prophylaxis), and VORI in 1 (5%); related-adverse effects with L-AmB in 2 (10%) or VORI in 2 (10%); and combination treatment with L-AmB in 3 (15%), or caspofungin in 1 (5%). The median duration of treatment in bIFI vs. non-bIFI patients was 90 days (IQR: 62.5–119.5) vs. 85 days (IQR: 61.5–149), p Table 5 Regarding outcomes, a large number of patients achieved a favorable response, being higher in those with bIFI. Overall and IFI-related mortality in this group were 11.4% and 5.7%, respectively. Outcome variables are shown in Figure 2 4. Discussion The study assessed the effectiveness and safety of ISA for treating HD and HCT patients with IFIs. Patients with several risk factors for IFIs, most of them neutropenic, were included. Patients with proven and probable IFIs, either non-bIFIs or bIFIs, were analyzed separately. Aspergillosis and mucormycoses were the IFIs most commonly diagnosed, largely located in the lungs and paranasal sinuses. Almost half of the cases received ISA as a first-line treatment, mainly as monotherapy. Among bIFI patients, those who received ISA as a first-line therapy were mainly undergoing FLUCO or VORI prophylaxis. Half of the patients treated with ISA as a continuation therapy after L-AmB were receiving POSA prophylaxis. In a large proportion of patients with bIFIs, a clinical response was observed, with low overall and IFI-related 90-day mortality rates. These are the major findings of the present study: first, in terms of IFI epidemiology, our cohort had similarities and differences with other real-life studies. In a multicenter study including centers from the USA, Europe, and Brazil, aspergillosis was the leading cause of IFI (79%), followed by fusariosis (8%) [ 41 42 21 26 27 29 Fourth, bIFIs are currently and frequently a major concern in clinical practice among HD and HCT patients, as it is difficult to identify the type of fungus involved. The sensitivity of GM in BAL proved to be lower in patients that receive antifungal prophylaxis compared to those that do not: 52% vs. 81%. Likewise, the sensitivity of serum GM and culture in BAL is 31.3% and 18.8%. A combination of these methods can increase diagnostic efficacy [ 43 44 45 19 20 46 Sixth, 10 patients under continuation ISA therapy after L-AmB were receiving primary prophylaxis with POSA. Interestingly, ISA and POSA have the same antifungal spectrum, and both proved effective for aspergillosis and mucormycosis [ 21 22 47 48 21 Moreover, one of the several reasons for developing bIFI is that the antifungal agent does not achieve enough serum levels. This is frequently observed in VORI, but has also been described with POSA, even in tablet formulations. A study in patients with acute leukemia and HCT receiving POSA prophylaxis found that 18% of them had subtherapeutic serum levels (<700 ng/mL). Factors such as having diarrhea, receiving proton pump inhibitors, and weighing more than 90 kg were associated with subtherapeutic serum levels, with the first two being common in HD and HCT patients [ 49 50 51 29 30 Eighth, our patients with bIFI had higher clinical response and lower mortality rate than those in other real-life studies, which report a mortality rate of 35% [ 17 52 53 54 Our study has some limitations that should be considered. First, data on the azoles serum levels or susceptibility testing were not available. Patients’ good outcomes could only be partly explained by these factors. However, there are no clinical susceptibility cut-off values for molds, except for Aspergillus fumigatus 55 The strengths of our study rely on its multicenter design. It was carried out in healthcare facilities specialized in the treatment of patients with HD and HCT. In addition, all of them were evaluated, treated, and followed up by the investigators. Therefore, our results accurately reveal IFIs complex scenario. Moreover, our study comprised the largest cohort from Latin America. In conclusion, the study data evidenced ISA effectiveness and safety for the treatment of HD and HCT patients with IFI. It further showed a suitable option for treating patients with bIFIs. However, larger studies should be conducted to confirm this finding. Acknowledgments We thank Valeria Melia, scientific translator at CEMIC Research Unit, for English edition of the manuscript.
