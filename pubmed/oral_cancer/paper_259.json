Introduction Cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat because of its biological complexity, genetic heterogeneity, and ability to evade conventional therapies. 1,2 3,4 5,6 Ancient Egyptian civilizations gave the earliest evidence of cancer treatment (circa 2600 BCE), which was limited to surgical excision or cauterization. 7 et al. 8 9,10 11 The field of anticancer agents has evolved remarkably over the past decades, directed by advances in medicinal chemistry that have enabled the design of increasingly selective and effective therapeutic modalities. 12,13 Fig. 1 14 Fig. 1 Classifications of anticancer drugs. Traditional cytotoxic agents represent the earliest class of anticancer drugs and remain essential in many treatment regimens. 15,16 17,18 19 e.g. 20–22 23 24 The rise of targeted therapies marked a paradigm shift in oncology, enabling the development of small molecules that specifically inhibit oncogenic drivers. 25–28 9,29,30 31,32 33 34 In addition to inhibition, the targeted breakdown of disease-causing proteins has been made possible using medicinal chemistry. 35 36 37 38 Biologics and antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a fusion of biological targeting and medicinal chemistry. 39 via 40 41 The field of immunotherapy is dominated by biologics; however, medicinal chemistry is becoming more and more involved in the development of small-molecule immunomodulators. 42 43 44 A re-emerging area of interest involves metal-based anticancer agents. 45 46 47 Advances in drug delivery systems have also been deeply informed by medicinal chemistry. 48–50 51–53 54 55 56 57,58 59 60 61 62 Radiotheranostics integrate molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy within a single chemical framework, allowing both diagnosis and treatment using the same targeting vector. The medicinal chemistry underpinning these agents centers on three elements: (i) the ligand, typically a peptide, antibody, or small molecule, optimized for high affinity and selective receptor binding; (ii) the chelating moiety, such as 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), or N N N N versus 63 64,65 66 67 68,69 Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a transformative driver in medicinal chemistry, shifting optimization strategies beyond classical SAR. 70 de novo 71 72 de novo 73 74 75 76 This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of anticancer drug development from a medicinal chemistry perspective. We will explore molecular design strategies, structure-based innovations, and chemical strategies behind clinically approved and investigational agents, and highlight future directions from artificial intelligence in drug design to new modalities like molecular glues and radiotheranostics. Together, these insights underscore the indispensable role of medicinal chemistry in advancing the fight against cancer. 2. Classification of anticancer agents according to their clinical phase 2.1. Food and drug administration (FDA)-approved anticancer drugs (2015–2025) 2.1.1. Targeted therapies 2.1.1.1. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 2.1.1.1.1. Osimertinib (Tagrisso) Osimertinib is a third-generation, oral EGFR TKI specifically designed to target both sensitizing EGFR mutations ( e.g. 77 via 78 via 79 Table 1 Table 1 FDA-approved drugs' therapeutic uses, mechanism of action, indication, subclass, and SAR Drug name Therapeutic class Mechanism of action Indication Subclass Structure–activity relationship (SAR) Osimertinib Targeted therapy EGFR T790M inhibitor NSCLC Tyrosine kinase inhibitor Acrylamide warhead: covalent EGFR Cys797; methoxy group: T790M selectivity; aniline: ↓ CYP3A4 metabolism Tivozanib Targeted therapy VEGFR inhibitor Renal cell carcinoma Tyrosine kinase inhibitor Urea linker: H-bond to VEGFR2; chlorophenyl: Hydrophobic moiety; polar chains: selectivity/solubility Romvimza (vimseltinib) Targeted therapy CSF1R inhibitor Tenosynovial giant cell tumor Tyrosine kinase inhibitor Amide linkers for binding; polar side chains: selectivity/solubility Palbociclib Targeted therapy CDK4/6 inhibitor HR+/HER2− breast cancer Kinase inhibitor Piperazine: solubility; tertiary amines: bioavailability; pyridine N: CDK4 selectivity; cyclopentane: CDK6 hydrophobic position Abemaciclib Targeted therapy CDK4/6 inhibitor HR+/HER2− breast cancer Kinase inhibitor More lipophilic → better CNS penetration; NH H-bonding; propyl group: selectivity Gomekli (mirdametinib) Targeted therapy MEK1/2 inhibitor Neurofibromatosis type 1 Kinase inhibitor H-bond donor: MEK1 hinge; halogen: potency Dostarlimab-gxly Immunotherapy PD-1 inhibitor dMMR (deficient mismatch repair) endometrial cancer Checkpoint inhibitor Biologic SAR: Fc-region amino acid substitutions Retifanlimab Immunotherapy PD-1 inhibitor Merkel cell carcinoma Checkpoint inhibitor IgG1 mAb with variable region mutations Nivolumab + hyaluronidase-nvhy Immunotherapy Subcutaneous PD-1 inhibitor Melanoma, NSCLC, others Checkpoint inhibitor Hyaluronidase: tissue permeability Remestemcel- l Immunotherapy Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy Pediatric steroid-refractory acute GVHD Cell therapy No SAR; activity via Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan Antibody–drug conjugate HER2-directed ADC (Topo I payload) HER2-low/ultralow breast cancer Antibody–drug conjugate Linker stability, cleavable linker, exatecan payload Datopotamab deruxtecan Antibody–drug conjugate TROP2-directed ADC HR+/HER2− breast cancer Antibody–drug conjugate Linker/topoisomerase SAR drives selectivity and potency Emrelis Antibody–drug conjugate c-Met-targeted ADC NSCLC with high c-Met expression Antibody–drug conjugate Likely similar ADC SAR; structural info needed Treosulfan Cytotoxic chemotherapy Alkylating agent AML, MDS (transplant conditioning) Alkylating agent Diols improve water solubility Sotorasib + panitumumab Combination therapy KRAS G12C inhibitor + EGFR blockade KRAS G12C-mutant colorectal cancer Combination therapy Acrylamide: KRAS binding; lipophilic tail: cell permeability, oral bioavailability Encorafenib + cetuximab + mFOLFOX6 Combination therapy BRAF inhibitor + EGFR inhibitor + chemo BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal cancer Combination therapy Pyrazole: π–π interaction; sulfonamide: BRAF pocket Acalabrutinib + bendamustine + rituximab Combination therapy BTK inhibitor + chemo Untreated mantle cell lymphoma Combination therapy Propynamide: BTK covalent binding; methyl group: ↓ ITK off-target Avmapki Fakzynja Other targeted therapy KRAS-targeting combo (likely kinase inhibitor) Low-grade serous ovarian cancer Targeted therapy Likely kinase scaffold; needs structural clarification Avutometinib Targeted therapy MEK inhibitor (Not clearly stated) Kinase inhibitor (likely) Pyrimidin-yloxy: MEK H-bonding; fluorinated ring: bioavailability; sulfamoylamino: solubility; chromenone methyl: dual inhibition Defactinib Targeted therapy FAK inhibitor (Not clearly stated) Kinase inhibitor Pyrimidine: H-bonding, planarity; para   Structure–activity relationship Osimertinib is designed to irreversibly target mutant EGFR harboring the T790M resistance mutation. The acrylamide warhead plays a pivotal role by covalently binding to the cysteine residue (Cys797) in the mutant EGFR kinase domain (SI Fig. S1A). A methoxy group positioned on the aromatic ring selectively blocks wild-type EGFR interaction, thereby improving mutant selectivity. Additionally, meta N N N′ N N 80,81 Fig. 2A Fig. 2 SAR illustration of some FDA-approved drugs: tyrosine kinase inhibitors (A), kinase inhibitors (B), alkylating agents (C), combination chemotherapy regimens (D), and other targeted therapies (E). 2.1.1.1.2. Tivozanib (Fotivda) Tivozanib is a potent and highly selective oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, -2, and -3 (VEGFR-1, -2, and -3), making it a promising anti-angiogenic agent for solid tumors, particularly renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 82 83 84 85 Table 1   Structure–activity relationship Tivozanib utilizes a quinoline-based scaffold. A urea linker enables dual hydrogen bonding with the VEGFR-2 hinge region, providing strong kinase binding. The incorporation of a chlorophenyl group facilitates hydrophobic interactions, improving binding affinity. Moreover, the presence of hydrogen bond acceptors and polar side chains supports selectivity among VEGFR isoforms and enhances water solubility for better pharmacokinetics. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group attached to the urea moiety enhanced both EGFR and VEGFR-2 inhibitory activities compared to analogues lacking such substitution. Introduction of an oxygen bridge favored VEGFR-2 inhibition, whereas replacement of the oxygen with sulfur shifted the activity profile toward stronger EGFR inhibition 86 Fig. 2A 2.1.1.1.3. Vimseltinib (Romvimza) Vimseltinib, approved under the trade name romvimza in 2025, is a switch-control TKI that selectively targets colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). CSF1R is overexpressed in macrophage-rich tumors such as tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), which plays a key role in the recruitment and proliferation of tumor-associated macrophages. By inhibiting CSF1R, vimseltinib disrupts the tumor microenvironment and induces regression of macrophage-driven tumors. 87 88 Table 1   Structure–activity relationship Vimseltinib structure includes an amide linker known for hinge region binding and polar side chains that enhance both selectivity and solubility. These features ensure effective inhibition of CSF1R-driven signaling pathways implicated in tumor-associated macrophage activity. Replacement of the dimethylamino group in some analogues with a diethylamino group increased CSF1R potency and selectivity, whereas substitution of the 2-methyl group on the pyridine ring caused a marked reduction in CSF1R selectivity 89 Fig. 2A 2.1.1.2. Kinase inhibitors 2.1.1.2.1. Palbociclib (Ibrance) Palbociclib is an orally available, selective cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor, introduced as a targeted therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer. CDK4/6 are critical regulators of cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, and their inhibition by palbociclib results in hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, cell cycle arrest, and decreased tumor cell proliferation. 90 91 92 Table 1   Structure–activity relationship Palbociclib is characterized by the presence of a piperazine ring, which significantly improves aqueous solubility and facilitates salt formation for formulation purposes. The tertiary amines within the piperazine also enhance oral bioavailability. A pyridine nitrogen linked to the piperazine ring is crucial for binding CDK4 selectively. Furthermore, a cyclopentane moiety contributes to a tight hydrophobic site filling, enhancing CDK6 inhibition. Substitution of the aniline side chain with a 2-aminopyridine moiety in some derivatives resulted in preferential inhibition of CD4 over CD2. Incorporation of a cyclopentyl group improved the physical properties compared to other analogues, while replacement of the acetyl group with bromine increased lipophilicity 93 Fig. 2B 2.1.1.2.2. Abemaciclib (Verzenio) Abemaciclib is another oral CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for the treatment of HR+/HER2− advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Unlike palbociclib, abemaciclib allows for continuous daily dosing due to a different toxicity profile, particularly lower rates of neutropenia. 94 95 96 Table 1   Structure–activity relationship Structurally related to palbociclib, abemaciclib incorporates additional lipophilic side chains, which facilitate blood–brain barrier penetration—an advantage for treating central nervous system (CNS) metastases. The NH group contributes hydrogen bonding critical for kinase binding, while steric hindrance from the propyl moiety improves selectivity against off-target kinases. In the benzo[ d N 1 93,97 Fig. 2B 2.1.1.2.3. Mirdametinib (Gomekli) Mirdametinib is a highly selective MEK1/2 inhibitor developed for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated plexiform neurofibromas. 98 99 100 Table 1   Structure–activity relationship A key hydrogen bond donor in the mirdametinib structure enables binding to the MEK1 hinge region. Strategic halogen replacements on the aromatic ring enhance binding potency and improve pharmacodynamic effects, supporting efficacy in MEK-driven malignancies. 101 102,103 Fig. 2B The future of targeted therapies in oncology is evolving across multiple drug classes. For TKIs, next-generation strategies focus on the development of allosteric inhibitors, covalent reversible TKIs, dual-target designs, and brain-penetrant scaffolds to overcome resistance and improve CNS penetration. 104 105 106 2.1.2. Immunotherapies 2.1.2.1. Checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1) 2.1.2.1.1. Dostarlimab-gxly (Jemperli) Dostarlimab-gxly is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor expressed on activated T cells. By blocking PD-1 interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, dostarlimab restores T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells, effectively enhancing anti-tumor immunity. 107 107 via 108 Table 1 2.1.2.1.2. Retifanlimab (Zynyz) Retifanlimab is a fully humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody developed for immune checkpoint blockade. Approved in 2023, it is indicated for patients with metastatic or recurrent Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a highly aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer often associated with Merkel cell polyomavirus. 107 109 110 Table 1 2.1.2.1.3. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy (Opdivo Qvantig) Nivolumab is a well-established anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody with broad indications across multiple solid tumors. 111 112 This formulation maintains nivolumab's potent PD-1 blockade while offering improved patient convenience and reduced administration time compared to intravenous infusions. Pharmacokinetics remain comparable, with sustained plasma concentrations ensuring effective immune checkpoint inhibition. The combination aims to improve the quality of life without compromising efficacy or safety, a significant advance in immunotherapy delivery 113 Table 1 These monoclonal antibodies were developed using rational antibody engineering. Strategies included variable region (VH/VL) modifications to fine-tune PD-1 binding affinity and Fc engineering to reduce effector functions such as ADCC. Dostarlimab was engineered as a humanized IgG4 antibody with durable receptor occupancy. Retifanlimab was optimized for high binding affinity and pharmacokinetic properties. Nivolumab was designed with an IgG4 backbone to prevent Fc receptor-mediated T-cell depletion. 114–116   Structure–activity relationship Dostarlimab, retifanlimab, and nivolumab are monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1. Their SAR lies primarily in the engineered variable regions that modulate antigen binding affinity. Specific amino acid substitutions and glycosylation patterns in the Fc region are optimized to reduce effector function, thereby minimizing unwanted immune activation. 117 2.1.2.2. Cell therapy 2.1.2.2.1. Remestemcel- l Remestemcel- l versus 118 119 l 120 Table 1 The synthesis strategy is based on ex vivo e.g. 121,122   Structure–activity relationship Although traditional SAR of remestemcel- l e.g. 123 2.1.3. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) 2.1.3.1. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu) Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (DXd) is a next-generation ADC that targets HER2, a receptor overexpressed in breast cancer cells. The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab is linked via 124 125 126 Table 1 Enhertu was synthesized by conjugating trastuzumab (anti-HER2) to the topoisomerase I inhibitor DXd via 127 2.1.3.1.1 Structure–activity relationship This antibody–drug conjugate targets HER2 and includes a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. The stability of the cleavable linker ensures tumor-selective release of the cytotoxic drug. The exatecan derivative used as a payload is potent and membrane-permeable, allowing for a bystander killing effect, which expands the therapeutic window, particularly in HER2-low tumors. 128 2.1.3.2. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Datroway) Datopotamab deruxtecan is an ADC targeting trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), a transmembrane glycoprotein widely expressed in epithelial cancers, including breast cancer. 129 130 131 Table 1 2.1.3.2.1 Structure–activity relationship A TROP2-targeted ADC sharing the same payload and linker chemistry as trastuzumab deruxtecan. Structural modifications to the mAb enhance its hydrophilicity and stability, enabling a controlled release mechanism that reduces systemic toxicity while maintaining potent antitumor activity. 132 133 2.1.3.3. Emrelis Emrelis is a novel ADC targeting the c-Met receptor, a tyrosine kinase implicated in tumor proliferation, metastasis, and resistance in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 134 via 135 2.1.3.3.1 Structure–activity relationship Though specific SAR data is lacking, Emrelis is presumed to follow similar principles of ADC design—selective antibody targeting, stable linker-payload conjugation, and release of a highly potent cytotoxic agent in tumor environments ( Table 1 The next wave of ADC development focuses on target diversification beyond HER2 and TROP2 to include receptors like HER3, c-Met, and B7–H3. Advances in linker chemistry—such as redox-sensitive or tumor pH-activated linkers—will improve payload release specificity. Additionally, the use of site-specific conjugation technologies ( e.g. 136 2.1.4. Cytotoxic chemotherapy 2.1.4.1. Alkylating agents 2.1.4.1.1. Treosulfan (Grafapex) Treosulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent that induces DNA cross-linking, leading to apoptosis. In January 2025, the FDA approved treosulfan in combination with fludarabine as a preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in patients aged 1 year and older with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 137 138 139 Table 1 Treosulfan is a prodrug that spontaneously converts in vivo 140   Structure–activity relationship Treosulfan is a water-soluble prodrug that undergoes non-enzymatic activation to produce bifunctional epoxide species. The inclusion of diol functional groups enhances its solubility, making it a useful agent for myeloablative conditioning with a reduced toxicity profile compared to busulfan. A wide range of stem cell toxicities was observed among the busulfan analogs, correlating with their ability to induce donor-type chimerism after bone marrow transplantation. In vitro in vivo 132,141 Fig. 2C 2.1.5. Combination chemotherapy regimens 2.1.5.1. Sotorasib + panitumumab Sotorasib is a covalent inhibitor targeting the kirsten rat sarcoma gene mutation, where the amino acid glycine (G) at position 12 is replaced by cysteine (C) (KRAS G12C) mutation, while panitumumab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. The combination was approved in early 2025 for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have received prior chemotherapy. 138 142–144 Table 1 Sotorasib was synthesized via d via 145 2.1.5.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Sotorasib employs an acrylamide group that covalently binds to Cys12 in the KRAS G12C mutant protein (SI Fig. S1B). The sulfonamide moiety enhances binding via 146–148 Fig. 2D 2.1.5.2. Encorafenib + cetuximab + mFOLFOX6 Encorafenib is a B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, which is an inhibitor of a specific mutation where the amino acid valine (V) at position 600 is replaced by glutamic acid (E) (BRAF V600E) inhibitor, and cetuximab is an anti-EGFR antibody. When combined with the chemotherapy regimen mFOLFOX6 (comprising folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin). 149 150 151 Table 1 Encorafenib features a pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold with a sulfonamide substituent targeting the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E. The dimethylpyrazole group avoids paradoxical MAPK activation. Synthesis involves coupling heteroaryl moieties and optimizing halogenated tails to adjust pharmacokinetics. 152 2.1.5.2.1 Structure–activity relationship Encorafenib includes a dimethylpyrazole moiety that prevents paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway, commonly seen with first-generation BRAF inhibitors. A sulfonamide group occupies the V600E-mutant BRAF ATP-binding site, while halogen substitutions fine-tune solubility and pharmacokinetics. The pyrazolo-pyrimidine scaffold directs the terminal phenyl/sulfonamide into the allosteric pocket, and replacing the pyrazole or pyrimidine, or removing the sulfonamide, generally reduces potency. Modifications of the sulfonamide N 132,153 Fig. 2D 2.1.5.3. Acalabrutinib + bendamustine + rituximab Acalabrutinib is a selective Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 154 155 156 Table 1 Acalabrutinib was synthesized using a pyrazolopyrimidine core bearing a propynamide warhead for covalent binding to Cys481 of BTK. Its synthesis involves nucleophilic substitutions and coupling with the electrophilic warhead, with steric shielding groups minimizing off-target binding. 157 2.1.5.3.1 Structure–activity relationship Acalabrutinib is a second-generation BTK inhibitor that features a covalent propynamide warhead, forming an irreversible bond with Cys481 (SI Fig. S1C). A pyrazolopyrimidine core provides hinge-binding specificity. The methyl substituent minimizes off-target activity, especially against Interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), while polar groups increase aqueous solubility. Compared with ibrutinib, which irreversibly targets Cys481 but shows broad off-target kinase inhibition, acalabrutinib retains the covalent binding mechanism yet incorporates a refined hinge-binding headgroup that reduces off-target activity. This modification preserves potent BTK inhibition while improving tolerability, exemplifying how headgroup electronic and steric tuning can achieve greater selectivity 132,158,159 Fig. 2D The future of targeted therapies in oncology is advancing across multiple drug classes. For KRAS inhibitors, sotorasib has initiated a new era for KRAS G12C-mutant cancers; however, limitations due to resistance mutations and EGFR feedback have led to the development of pan-KRAS and G12D/G13D-selective inhibitors, with combinations involving EGFR antibodies ( e.g. 160 161 2.1.6. Other targeted therapies 2.1.6.1. Avmapki Fakzynja Co-pack (avutometinib + defactinib) Avutometinib is a MEK1/2 inhibitor, and defactinib is a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor. The combination was granted accelerated approval in May 2025 for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS-mutated recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) 162,163 164 Table 1 Avutometinib was synthesized around a chromen-2-one scaffold with a pyrimidin-2-yloxy group for MEK/RAF dual binding. Substituents such as fluoropyridine and sulfamoylamino groups enhance metabolic stability and solubility. Defactinib features a pyrimidine core, para 165,166 2.1.6.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Avutometinib is a dual MEK and RAF inhibitor with a chromen-2-one core. A pyrimidin-2-yloxy substituent improves MEK binding via 132 para 167 Fig. 2E 2.1.6.2. Romvimza (vimseltinib) Vimseltinib is an oral, selective inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), a tyrosine kinase implicated in the pathogenesis of tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT). 168 88 Table 1 Vimseltinib is a selective CSF1R TKI with a tricyclic core scaffold and hinge-binding heterocycles. Its synthesis incorporates a urea or amide linker connecting to a polar head group for improved selectivity and oral bioavailability. 169 2.1.6.3. Mirdametinib (Gomekli) Mirdametinib is an oral MEK1/2 inhibitor approved in February 2025 for the treatment of adults 170 171 170 100 Table 1 Mirdametinib is an MEK1/2 inhibitor containing a substituted indazole ring and amide linkage. It selectively blocks MEK activity in the MAPK pathway. Synthesis involves the coupling of indazole with urea or carbamate side chains to enhance stability and kinase selectivity. 101 The future prospects: dual-pathway inhibition is gaining momentum in oncology, exemplified by the combination of avutometinib (MEK/RAF inhibitor) and defactinib (FAK inhibitor), which targets both tumor signaling and the microenvironment, showing promise in KRAS-mutated cancers like LGSOC. 172 173 101 2.2. Investigational anticancer drugs in clinical trials 2.2.1. Targeted small molecules 2.2.1.1. Divarasib (GDC-6036) Divarasib is a covalent, selective inhibitor of the KRAS G12C oncoprotein that binds the switch II pocket of KRAS in its inactive GDP-bound state. This prevents KRAS activation and inhibits downstream MAPK pathway signaling, leading to antiproliferative effects in tumors harboring the KRAS G12C mutation. In a multicenter Phase I/II trial, divarasib demonstrated a confirmed overall response rate (ORR) of 53% in KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC and 29% in colorectal cancer (CRC), with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.1 months (NSCLC) and 5.6 months (CRC). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were mainly low-grade, with only 12% of patients experiencing grade 3/4 events and no treatment-related mortality 174 Table 2 Table 2 Investigational anticancer drugs in clinical trials Drug name Drug class Mechanism of action Indication Key clinical outcome/phase Structure–Activity relationship (SAR) Divarasib (GDC-6036) KRAS inhibitor Covalent inhibitor of KRAS G12C (switch II pocket) NSCLC & CRC (KRAS G12C+) ORR 53% (NSCLC); PFS 13.1 mo – Phase I/II C7-substitution ( e.g. Glecirasib (JAB-21822) KRAS inhibitor Covalent KRAS G12C inhibitor Solid tumors (KRAS G12C+) ORR 48%, PFS 8.2 mo, OS ∼13.6 mo – Phase IIb 1,8-Naphthyridine scaffold optimized for solubility and metabolic stability; enhances irreversible KRAS G12C inhibition PRT543 Epigenetic inhibitor PRMT5 inhibitor (splicing and epigenetic regulation) Ovarian cancer, MDS CR in 1 ovarian case; responses in hematologic malignancies PRMT5 inhibitors with π–π interactions at Phe327; basic amines in pharmacophore tuned for selectivity and stability Tulmimetostat (CPI-0209) Epigenetic inhibitor Dual EZH1/EZH2 inhibitor (chromatin modulation) ARID1A-mutant cancers ∼25% PRs; thrombocytopenia, GI AEs (gastrointestinal adverse events) – Phase I/II EZH1/2 dual inhibition via Pegargiminase (ADI-PEG20) Enzyme therapy Depletes extracellular arginine in ASS1-deficient tumors Melanoma, glioblastoma SD 41–50%, PFS 3–5 mo, OS ∼8–11 mo – Phase I PEGylated arginine deiminase improves stability and tumor targeting in ASS1-deficient cancers  225 Radiopharmaceutical Actinium-225-labeled PSMA-targeted alpha emitter mCRPC (prostate cancer) PSA ≥50% decline in ∼47%, low toxicity – Phase I/II PSMA-targeting and alpha emitter tuning optimize selective radiation delivery with minimized hematologic toxicity Scancell SCIB1 DNA vaccine Plasmid vaccine encoding TRP2/gp100 melanoma antigens Resected advanced melanoma 100% OS at cut-off; 5 relapses only – Phase I/II Immunogenic TRP2/gp100 plasmid vaccine optimized for T-cell response and minimal off-target expression Gridegalutamide PROTAC Androgen receptor degradation + antagonism mCRPC PSA declines; strong receptor degradation – Phase I Linker rigidity and AR binding domain shape enhance proteasomal degradation and androgen signaling blockade Opaganib (ABC294640) SK2 inhibitor Inhibits sphingosine kinase 2 Solid tumors Some synergy with chemo – Phase II/III Selective SK2 inhibition achieved by hydrophobic core tuning and solubility-driven modifications Sapacitabine Nucleoside analog DNA synthesis inhibitor, induces SSBs in S-phase AML, MDS (elderly/unfit patients) ORR 30–45%, OS ∼30% at 1 year – Phase II S-Phase selective analog design ensures DNA incorporation; substitutions influence chain termination and SSB induction KappaMab (MDX-1097) Monoclonal antibody Targets kappa-light chain on MM cells Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma ORR 83% with combo; OS benefit – Phase IIb Targeting epitope binding and antibody engineering improves MM cell selectivity and immune-mediated killing Glesatinib (MGCD-265) TKI (type II MET) Dual MET and SMO kinase inhibitor MET-amplified NSCLC ORR ∼15%, low efficacy – Phase II Type II MET inhibition via 2.2.1.1.1 Structure–activity relationship SAR studies of divarasib highlight the importance of the 2-amino-4-methyl-5-trifluoromethyl-pyridine moiety at C7, which enhances binding to the KRAS switch II pocket and properly orients the acrylamide warhead for covalent targeting of Cys12. Modifications in this region affect labeling kinetics, while C2-substitution is generally tolerated due to low steric hindrance. Divarasib also maintains a conserved binding pose across related guanosine triphosphateases (GTPases), supporting scaffold flexibility. These findings emphasize the need to optimize both reversible binding and warhead reactivity for selective KRAS(G12C) inhibition. Optimizing the covalent warhead geometry and electronics showed that subtle changes in position, electrophilicity, or leaving-group properties ( e.g. versus 175,176 Fig. 3A Fig. 3 SAR illustration of investigational drugs: targeted small molecules (A), epigenetic inhibitors (B), enzyme-based therapies (C), radiopharmaceuticals (D), PROTACs/AR pathway inhibitors (E), metabolic/lipid pathway inhibitors (F), cytotoxic nucleoside analogs (G), and MET/SMO kinase inhibitors (H). 2.2.1.2. Glecirasib (JAB-21822) Glecirasib is another irreversible KRAS G12C inhibitor in clinical development, selectively binding to and stabilizing the GDP-bound inactive form of KRAS. This blockade disrupts oncogenic signaling and tumor growth in KRAS G12C-mutated malignancies. In a Phase IIb trial involving 119 patients with advanced solid tumors, glecirasib achieved an objective response rate (ORR) of 48%, a disease control rate (DCR) of 86%, a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 8.2 months, and an overall survival (OS) of 13.6 months. Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 38.7% of patients, though no treatment-related deaths were reported 177 Table 2 2.2.1.2.1 Structure–activity relationship Glecirasib is a covalent KRAS^G12C inhibitor developed using structure-based design. Its 1,8-naphthyridine-3-carbonitrile scaffold anchors in the switch II pocket, while a precisely positioned warhead enables selective covalent binding to Cys12 (SI Fig. S1D). Further SAR refinements improved solubility, reduced metabolic liabilities, and enhanced pharmacokinetics, resulting in a potent and well-balanced clinical candidate for KRAS^G12C-mutant cancers. Glecirasib (JAB-21822) represents an optimized KRAS G12C inhibitor with nanomolar potency (IC 50 e.g. 178,179 Fig. 3A 2.2.2. Epigenetic inhibitors 2.2.2.1. PRT543 PRT543 is an orally available selective inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an enzyme that regulates transcription and splicing via 180 Table 2 2.2.2.1.1 Structure–activity relationship PRT543 is a first-generation, SAM-competitive inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). It binds selectively to the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) pocket, forming key hydrogen-bond and electrostatic interactions with critical residues such as Glu392, Leu319, Asp419, Tyr324, Met420, Pro314, and Lys393, which normally stabilize SAM in the PRMT5 active site (SI Fig. S1E). Building on early clinical inhibitors like GSK3326595, which exhibited limited clinical tolerability, PRT543 was optimized to achieve both enhanced potency and improved oral exposure. This combination enabled its progression into clinical trials with clear evidence of target modulation in patients, highlighting how fine-tuning potency alongside PK properties is essential for advancing PRMT5 inhibitors 181–183 Fig. 3B 2.2.2.2. Tulmimetostat (CPI-0209) Tulmimetostat is a dual enhancer of zeste homolog 2 and enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH2/EZH1) inhibitor that targets polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), disrupting transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This compound shows efficacy in epigenetically dysregulated cancers, such as AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A)-mutant endometrial carcinoma and lymphomas. Phase I/II clinical trial results demonstrated partial responses in ∼25% of patients, with tolerable side effects, including thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal disturbances 184 Table 2 2.2.2.2.1 Structure–activity relationship Tulmimetostat (CPI-0209) is a next-generation dual EZH1/EZH2 inhibitor designed to target the SET domain and overcome resistance to EZH2-specific agents. Its central aromatic scaffold enables strong binding, while SAR-driven substitutions balance dual inhibition and minimize off-target effects. Peripheral modifications improve permeability, oral bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics. Tulmimetostat shows enhanced activity in tumors with ARID1A mutations or EZH2 gain-of-function, supporting its potential as a broad-spectrum anticancer agent. Dual EZH1/EZH2 inhibition is preferred to prevent EZH1 compensation, as modifications that selectively reduce EZH1 affinity can decrease efficacy in certain ARID1A contexts. Therefore, the design maintains activity against both isoforms 185,186 Fig. 3B 2.2.3. Enzyme-based therapies 2.2.3.1. Pegargiminase (ADI-PEG20) Pegargiminase is a pegylated arginine deiminase that depletes circulating arginine, a critical amino acid for the growth of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1)-deficient tumors, including melanoma and glioblastoma. In Phase I studies, pegargiminase combined with platinum-based chemotherapy yielded stable disease in about 50% of patients, with median PFS ranging from 3 to 5 months and OS between 8 and 11 months. Toxicities were mild and included fatigue, nausea, and transaminase elevations ( Table 2 2.2.3.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Pegargiminase is a pegylated arginine deiminase engineered to treat ASS1-deficient tumors by depleting extracellular arginine and inducing selective tumor cell death. Its native catalytic site ensures high specificity for l 187–189 Fig. 3C 2.2.4.

Scancell SCIB1 Scancell SCIB1 is a DNA plasmid-based cancer vaccine encoding tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) and glycoprotein 100 (gp100) melanoma-associated antigens, designed with an IgG1 Fc domain to enhance immune uptake and antigen presentation. In Phase I/II trials in resected melanoma, SCIB1 achieved a 100% survival rate at interim analysis, with T-cell activation detected in most patients and only five relapses 194 Table 2 Its design strategy includes epitope refinement for MHC-I binding, plasmid backbone optimization for expression, and helper domain insertion for CD4 + 195 2.2.5.1.1 Structure–activity relationship SCIB1 is a DNA vaccine encoding melanoma-associated antigens TRP2 and gp100 fused to a T-cell activation domain, aiming to enhance anti-tumor immunity in advanced melanoma. Its SAR focuses on optimized antigen selection for immunogenicity, epitope refinement to boost major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) binding and CD8 + + 196 2.2.6. PROTACs/AR pathway inhibitors 2.2.6.1. Gridegalutamide Gridegalutamide is a novel androgen receptor (AR) degrader using proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology. By hijacking the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, it degrades the AR protein while antagonizing residual signaling, offering a dual mechanism of action. In early Phase I trials for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), the drug achieved PSA reductions and potent AR knockdown with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile 197 Table 2 2.2.6.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Gridegalutamide is a PROTAC-based AR antagonist and degrader developed to overcome resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A PROTAC combining: (1) a high-affinity androgen receptor (AR) ligand, (2) E3 ligase recruiter (VHL or CRBN), and (3) optimized linker. Its SAR is defined by three optimized components: an AR-binding ligand with high affinity for both wild-type and mutant receptors, an E3 ligase ligand targeting cereblon, or the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (CRBN or VHL) selected for efficient degradation, and a tailored linker whose length and polarity influence ternary complex formation and cellular activity. These structural refinements enable potent AR degradation and enhanced efficacy in treatment-resistant prostate cancer. Linker length and flexibility are key SAR parameters, with optimized variants enhancing ternary complex formation and androgenic receptor turnover. Additionally, the choice of E3 ligase ligand ( e.g. versus 193,198,199 Fig. 3E 2.2.7. Metabolic/lipid pathway inhibitors 2.2.7.1. Opaganib (ABC294640) Opaganib is a selective inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2), an enzyme that modulates inflammatory and oncogenic sphingolipid signaling. This oral drug is being evaluated in Phase II/III studies across solid tumors and has shown synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in preclinical models. Full efficacy data are pending 200 Table 2 2.2.7.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Opaganib (ABC294640) is a selective oral sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2) inhibitor that disrupts cancer-promoting S1P signaling. Its SAR centers on a lipophilic amide scaffold featuring a naphthyl group, which enhances SK2 selectivity and membrane permeability. Refinement of the amide linker and nearby electronic features optimized binding orientation, potency, and metabolic stability. These modifications produced a compound with strong SK2 inhibition, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects, and good pharmacokinetics, while minimizing off-target activity. The most effective strategy to enhance potency was rigidifying the lipophilic tail to better occupy the J-shaped pocket, for example, by introducing an internal aryl or cycloaliphatic ring. Empirical studies on SphK2 inhibitors confirmed that this modification improves both potency and selectivity 201–203 Fig. 3F 2.2.8. Cytotoxic nucleoside analogs 2.2.8.1. Sapacitabine Sapacitabine is an oral deoxycytidine analog that induces single-stranded DNA breaks, leading to replication arrest and cell death. It is being studied in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. In Phase II studies, the drug yielded ORRs between 30–45%, with a 1-year survival rate of ∼30%. Common toxicities included neutropenia and febrile neutropenia 204 Table 2 2.2.8.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Sapacitabine is an oral nucleoside analog prodrug derived from 2′-deoxycytidine, designed to selectively disrupt DNA synthesis in cancer cells. Its structure–activity relationship (SAR) centers on the 2′-C-cyano group, which enhances enzymatic stability and promotes DNA incorporation. Once metabolized to CNDAC inside cells, it causes single-strand DNA breaks that convert to double-strand breaks during replication, inducing cell death in dividing cells. The prodrug design improves oral bioavailability and systemic exposure. Overall, sapacitabine's SAR reflects a strategic integration of stability, selective cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics, making it suitable for AML and MDS treatment in elderly or unfit patients. Prodrug strategies, such as N4 lipidation or phosphate prodrugs, effectively enhance oral exposure, with sapacitabine's palmitoyl amide serving as a validated example 205,206 Fig. 3G 2.2.9. Monoclonal antibodies 2.2.9.1. KappaMab (MDX-1097) KappaMab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the kappa-light chain on malignant plasma cells. In Phase IIb trials for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, it achieved an ORR of 83% compared to 45% with standard therapy and significantly prolonged OS. No severe infusion reactions were reported 207 Table 2 2.2.9.1.1 Structure–activity relationship KappaMab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target membrane-bound κ-free light chains (κ-FLCs) on malignant plasma cells in κ-restricted multiple myeloma. Its structure–activity relationship (SAR) focuses on optimizing CDRs in the variable region to achieve high specificity for κ-FLCs while avoiding normal B cells. SAR studies have shown that refined binding kinetics reduce interaction with circulating soluble κ-light chains. Additionally, the Fc region is engineered to promote strong antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, supporting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This balance of specificity, immune activation, and pharmacokinetics underlies its potential for treating relapsed or refractory κ-light chain multiple myeloma (MM). 208 2.2.10. Mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor/smoothened (MET/SMO) kinase inhibitors 2.2.10.1. Glesatinib (MGCD-265) Glesatinib is a type II small-molecule TKI that inhibits MET and SMO, both implicated in tumor progression and survival. It showed modest antitumor activity in NSCLC patients harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, with an ORR of ∼15%. The trial was terminated early due to insufficient efficacy. Adverse events included gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity 209 Table 2 2.2.10.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Glesatinib is a type II TKI that selectively targets the MET receptor in its inactive, highly conserved sequence found in the activation loop of protein kinases (DFG-out) conformation and also inhibits SMO in the Hedgehog pathway. Its structure–activity relationship (SAR) involves a hinge-binding moiety for ATP-pocket anchoring and a hydrophobic tail that occupies the MET gene's allosteric back pocket, enhancing selectivity (SI Fig. S1F). SAR studies focused on optimizing aromatic substitutions and side chains for potency, particularly against MET mutations, while polar group additions improved solubility and oral bioavailability. Despite its dual-target design and rational SAR-driven optimization, clinical efficacy in MET-amplified NSCLC was limited, resulting in discontinued development. However, early clinical studies revealed suboptimal pharmacokinetics and incomplete target inhibition, resulting in modest efficacy compared with newer, highly selective type I MET inhibitors such as capmatinib and tepotinib. This underscores the importance of both binding mode and exposure in achieving translational success 210,211 Fig. 3H Future directions in investigational anticancer therapies are embracing multi-target and personalized approaches. KRAS inhibitors like divarasib and glecirasib are expanding to pan-KRAS, non-covalent allosteric agents, and PROTAC degraders, with combinations involving SHP2, EGFR, and SOS1 showing promise for overcoming resistance. Epigenetic inhibitors such as PRT543 and tulmimetostat are evolving toward dual-targeting designs, aided by AI drug discovery and checkpoint blockade integration. Enzyme-based therapies like pegargiminase are being optimized for longer half-life and lower immunogenicity. 212 2.3. Withdrawn or discontinued anticancer drugs 2.3.1. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) 2.3.1.1. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) Mylotarg is a CD33-directed antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a recombinant humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody linked to the potent cytotoxic antibiotic calicheamicin. Designed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Mylotarg binds to CD33-expressing leukemic blasts, is internalized, and releases calicheamicin in the lysosomes, triggering double-stranded DNA breaks and apoptosis. Originally approved in 2000 under accelerated approval, the drug was voluntarily withdrawn in 2010 after the Phase III Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG S0106) trial demonstrated increased induction mortality (5.7% vs. 213 214 Table 3 Table 3 Withdrawn or discontinued anticancer drugs Drug name Drug class Mechanism of action Indication Reason for withdrawal Year Structure–activity relationship (SAR) Gemtuzumab ozogamicin ADC CD33-targeted ADC with calicheamicin (DNA damage) Relapsed AML Increased early mortality (SWOG S0106) 2010 Linker and antibody specificity are critical; calicheamicin potency demands precise delivery.

Affinity maturation and Fc optimization may enhance the response 2.3.1.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody–drug conjugate targeting CD33 on leukemic blasts in AML. Its SAR is defined by a high-affinity humanized IgG4 antibody, an acid-cleavable linker, and a calicheamicin payload. The linker ensures intracellular release within lysosomes while remaining stable in circulation. SAR studies on calicheamicin focused on structural modifications to retain potency while improving systemic tolerability. 215 216 2.3.1.2. Belantamab mafodotin (blenrep) Blenrep is a first-in-class ADC targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), conjugated to monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), a tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Approved in 2020 for heavily pretreated multiple myeloma, blenrep acts via 217 via 218 Table 3 2.3.1.2.1 Structure–activity relationship Belantamab mafodotin is an ADC targeting BCMA in multiple myeloma. Its SAR features an afucosylated anti-BCMA antibody to enhance ADCC, a non-cleavable mc linker, and the monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) payload, a tubulin inhibitor with limited diffusion, improving tumor selectivity and reducing systemic toxicity. The non-cleavable linker ensures intracellular MMAF release only after lysosomal degradation. This design optimizes immune engagement, payload confinement, and safety in refractory myeloma. 219 2.3.1.3. Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) Trodelvy is a TROP-2-directed ADC delivering SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor. Approved for urothelial carcinoma in 2021, Trodelvy showed promise in pretreated patients due to its bystander effect and internalization-dependent cytotoxicity. However, the confirmatory study evaluating sacituzumab govitecan Trodelvy in patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable urothelial cancer that has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapy (TROPiCS-04) Phase III trial failed to meet its primary overall survival endpoint (OS: 10.3 vs. p 220 221 Table 3 2.3.1.3.1 Structure–activity relationship Trodelvy is an ADC targeting Trop-2, composed of a high-affinity IgG1 antibody, the cytotoxic SN-38 payload, and a cleavable CL2A linker. SAR optimization includes a high DAR (8) for efficient payload delivery, a hydrophilic linker enabling tumor-selective release and bystander killing, and antibody engineering to enhance Trop-2 binding while limiting off-target effects. This design supports potent, selective activity in Trop-2-expressing cancers like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). 222 2.3.1.4. Camidanlumab tesirine Although not yet FDA-approved, it was withdrawn from development and is worth noting. It is an ADC composed of an anti-CD25 antibody linked to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer toxin, targeting CD25-expressing malignancies such as Hodgkin lymphoma and AML. Early-phase data showed >30% complete responses, but its further development was halted due to toxicity and unclear long-term efficacy 223 Table 3 c 224 2.3.1.4.1 Structure–activity relationship Camidanlumab tesirine is a CD25-targeting ADC composed of a fully human IgG1 antibody, a PBD dimer payload, and a protease-cleavable linker. SAR optimization focused on high-affinity binding and efficient internalization, while reducing off-target effects on normal CD25 + 225 2.3.2. Kinase inhibitors 2.3.2.1. Mobocertinib (Exkivity) Mobocertinib is an oral, irreversible TKI targeting EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, a subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with poor response to standard EGFR TKIs. It binds covalently to the cysteine-797 residue in the EGFR active site, blocking the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway, including PI3K (MAPK and PI3K) pathways. Mobocertinib was granted accelerated approval in 2021; however, the confirmatory clinical trial investigating the use of mobocertinib in previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (EXCLAIM-2) Phase III trial showed no improvement in PFS versus e.g. 226 227 Table 3 2.3.2.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Mobocertinib is an oral TKI designed to selectively inhibit EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in NSCLC. Its SAR is centered on a pyrimidine core with C-4 aniline modifications that enhance mutant selectivity, and an acrylamide warhead that covalently binds Cys797 for irreversible inhibition (SI Fig. S1G). A methyl-piperazine moiety improves oral bioavailability and systemic exposure. SAR refinements in polarity and hydrogen bonding reduce wild-type EGFR inhibition, minimizing toxicity while maintaining potency. Unlike poziotinib, which exhibits higher potency but poor selectivity and unacceptable toxicity, mobocertinib achieves a balance of potency and tolerability, demonstrating how structure-guided optimization of R-group vectors enables exon-specific SAR despite clinical trade-offs 228,229 Fig. 4A Fig. 4 SAR illustration of withdrawn drugs: kinase inhibitors (A) and cytotoxic/alkylating agents (B). 2.3.2.2. Infigratinib (Truseltiq) Infigratinib is a selective FGFR1–3 inhibitor developed for FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma.

Initially approved based on single-arm trial results, its confirmatory trial focuses on infigratinib versus vs. vs. 230 231,232 Table 3 2.3.2.2.1 Structure–activity relationship Infigratinib is a selective oral FGFR1–3 inhibitor designed for FGFR-altered cancers, particularly FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma. Its SAR is based on a pyrimidine–urea core that anchors the molecule in the FGFR ATP-binding site. Substitutions at C4 and C6 enhance hinge region binding, while a halogenated aryl group improves hydrophobic interactions. An ethylpiperazine moiety boosts solubility and oral bioavailability. SAR optimization focused on enhancing isoform selectivity and pharmacokinetics while minimizing off-target effects. A novel series of N N in vitro in vivo 233,234 Fig. 4A 2.3.2.3. Copanlisib (Aliqopa) Copanlisib is a pan-class PI3K inhibitor, selectively inhibiting PI3K-α and PI3K-δ isoforms, with activity in B-cell malignancies such as follicular lymphoma. Administered intravenously, copanlisib was associated with adverse metabolic events ( e.g. versus 235 Table 3 2.3.2.3.1 Structure–activity relationship Copanlisib is an IV-administered pan-class I PI3K inhibitor with selectivity for PI3K-α and PI3K-δ. Its SAR centers on a morpholino-triazine core, with C4 and C6 substitutions optimized to enhance isoform selectivity while reducing PI3K-β/γ off-target effects. Fluorinated aryl groups improve metabolic stability and half-life. Time-dependent inhibition of PI3K-δ supports durable activity in B-cell malignancies and contributes to its clinical efficacy and tolerability. The 2,3-dihydroimidazo[1,2- c 236,237 Fig. 4A 2.3.3.

Marqibo (liposomal vincristine) Marqibo was a reformulated liposomal form of vincristine for Ph-negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). It was quietly withdrawn from the market in May 2022 due to commercial and clinical limitations, involving neurotoxicity, which includes minimal differentiation from conventional vincristine, and logistical constraints of liposomal administration 241 Table 3 2.3.3.2.1 Structure–activity relationship Marqibo is a liposomal formulation of vincristine that enhances efficacy and safety through formulation-based SAR.

Vibostolimab Vibostolimab is a monoclonal antibody targeting T cell Immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), a co-inhibitory receptor on T cells and NK cells. It was hypothesized to enhance anti-tumor immune activity when combined with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. However, Phase I/II studies failed to show meaningful additive efficacy, and development was discontinued in 2024 244 Table 3 2.3.4.1.1 Structure–activity relationship Vibostolimab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting TIGIT to restore T-cell and NK cell function in tumors. Its SAR emphasizes high-affinity binding to TIGIT's extracellular domain to block CD155 interaction without disrupting CD226 co-stimulation. Unlike Fc-silent anti-TIGIT antibodies, vibostolimab retains wild-type IgG1 Fc to enable ADCC and potential Treg depletion. Epitope targeting and preserved effector function were key SAR features supporting synergistic activity with PD-1 inhibitors in solid tumors. 245 2.3.4.2. Favezelimab Favezelimab is a lymphocyte activation gene 3 (anti-LAG-3) monoclonal antibody that blocks LAG-3 signaling on exhausted T cells, promoting immune activation. Like vibostolimab, it failed to produce consistent responses in early trials and was terminated as a development program in the same year. These discontinuations reflect the ongoing challenge of translating checkpoint blockade beyond PD-1 and CTLA-4 (ref. 246 Table 3 2.3.4.2.1 Structure–activity relationship Favezelimab is an Fc-silent IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting LAG-3 to restore T-cell function in tumors. Its SAR centers on high-affinity binding to the D1 domain of LAG-3, blocking MHC–II interaction without triggering ADCC. Fc mutations ( e.g. 247 Future perspectives for withdrawn or discontinued anticancer drugs emphasize refining design strategies across different therapeutic classes. For ADCs such as Mylotarg, Blenrep, Trodelvy, and Camidanlumab, the future lies in creating more stable, tumor-specific linkers, site-specific conjugation for consistent DAR, and next-generation payloads with improved therapeutic windows, while bispecific ADCs and immune-modulating payloads are also advancing. 248 e.g. 249 e.g. 250 3.

Conclusion The past decade has witnessed unprecedented progress in anticancer drug development, with medicinal chemistry playing a central role in translating biological discoveries into clinically effective therapies. This review underscores how the intricate relationship between drug structure, molecular targets, and clinical efficacy has led to a paradigm shift—from conventional cytotoxic agents to precisely engineered molecules that exploit specific vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Medicinal chemistry has enabled the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, ADCs, and emerging platforms such as PROTACs and molecular glues. These modalities have revolutionized the treatment landscape across a variety of malignancies, including solid tumors and hematologic cancers. Key milestones include the development of selective kinase inhibitors like osimertinib and palbociclib, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as dostarlimab, and ADCs like fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan that combine targeting precision with cytotoxic potency. Structural optimization based on SAR analysis has been pivotal in enhancing drug specificity, reducing off-target toxicity, and improving pharmacokinetic profiles. Despite these advances, several challenges remain. Drug resistance, tumor heterogeneity, and immune evasion continue to limit long-term treatment efficacy. Moreover, the withdrawal of several anticancer agents due to suboptimal efficacy or unacceptable toxicity highlights the need for robust clinical validation and post-marketing surveillance. The failures of drugs like mobocertinib and belantamab mafodotin serve as critical reminders of the complexity of cancer biology and the importance of translational research. Future directions in anticancer drug discovery will rely heavily on interdisciplinary integration. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are beginning to reshape the early phases of drug design by predicting molecular interactions, optimizing lead compounds, and forecasting ADME/Tox profiles. Advances in epigenetic modulation, tumor microenvironment targeting, radiotheranostics, and cell-based therapies offer new horizons for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, drug delivery systems such as nanocarriers and liposomes, informed by chemical engineering principles, will further improve therapeutic index and tissue selectivity. In summary, medicinal chemistry remains the engine driving the evolution of oncology therapeutics. As our understanding of cancer biology deepens and new technologies emerge, the synergistic interplay between molecular design, pharmacological innovation, and clinical translation will be crucial in achieving the ultimate goal of personalized, durable, and curative cancer treatment. This review highlights not only past and present achievements but also illuminates the promising future of anticancer drug development through the lens of medicinal chemistry. 5. Expert opinion The past decade has marked a transformative period in anticancer drug development, with medicinal chemistry serving as the keystone in linking biological insights to therapeutic applications. The growing convergence of structural biology, pharmacology, and clinical oncology has enabled not just the synthesis of new drug candidates but also the realization of truly rational, mechanism-driven therapies. From kinase inhibitors and ADCs to PROTACs and radiotheranostics, the integration of SAR data into every stage of drug development is now standard. This trend is significantly impacting real-world outcomes by advancing treatment specificity, minimizing adverse effects, and improving cost-effectiveness through more durable responses. The clinical implications of these innovations are substantial. Structure-guided design and SAR-based optimization have led to drugs with superior pharmacokinetic and safety profiles—osimertinib's brain-penetrant EGFR inhibition, or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan's improved linker chemistry and payload delivery are just a few examples. In addition, medicinal chemistry's role in reformulating legacy drugs ( e.g. However, despite these successes, the translation of medicinal chemistry breakthroughs into routine clinical practice remains uneven. Cost, manufacturing complexity, and biomarker availability remain key barriers. Moreover, the accelerated approval of certain agents—followed by market withdrawal due to safety concerns or failed confirmatory trials—points to a need for improved translational validation. The cases of belantamab mafodotin and mobocertinib reflect how structural optimization alone is insufficient if real-world efficacy and tolerability are not adequately assessed across diverse patient populations. Critical areas for improvement include enhancing the predictability of preclinical models and adopting more integrative pharmacological assessments that reflect tumor microenvironment complexities. Technical limitations also persist—namely, in the accurate modeling of protein–protein interactions, drug metabolism prediction, and resistance emergence. AI-driven drug design and molecular dynamics simulations offer promise, but widespread use is still hindered by data standardization issues and a lack of regulatory frameworks that support such novel methodologies. Further research into emerging modalities such as epigenetic therapies, molecular glues, and immune-cell engagers will open new therapeutic windows. The interplay between medicinal chemistry and these domains will be crucial, as understanding the SAR of non-traditional small molecules ( e.g. While the field of oncology continues to diversify, the principles of medicinal chemistry will remain central to its progress. The future may indeed see immunotherapy, gene editing, and mRNA platforms dominate headlines, but these too will rely on structure-based chemistry to refine delivery, stability, and selectivity. Therefore, rather than competing disciplines, these technologies will likely converge under a unified medicinal chemistry framework. By 2030, we envision a drug discovery ecosystem in which SAR modeling is driven by integrated AI platforms, seamlessly connecting omics data, patient-derived models, and structure-based predictions. Clinicians will have access to decision-support tools that predict drug efficacy and resistance mechanisms in real time, allowing personalized therapy selection not just based on genotype but on predicted ligand–target interactions. Drug development timelines will be shortened through iterative virtual screening cycles and continuous learning systems. Most importantly, the standard oncology care paradigm will shift toward ultra-targeted, SAR-informed therapeutic regimens designed to outpace resistance and maximize patient benefit.
