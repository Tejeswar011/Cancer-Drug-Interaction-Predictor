Introduction Senescence is defined as a decrease in mitotic ability due to various stressors, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and telomere dysfunction [ 1 2 2 3 4 4 5 Oxidative stress caused by ROS is a main cause of aging. For example, polyADP-ribose polymerase 1, a nuclear enzyme that degrades nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + 6 7 + + 8 9 10 mev-1 Caenorhabditis elegans mev-1 11 mev-1 12 13 superoxide dismutase 1 SOD1 14 SOD1 14 Plants produce secondary metabolites to respond to pathogens and various stresses. Terpenes, phenols, and nitrogen-containing chemicals are the three major secondary metabolites produced by plants [ 15 15 16 Table 1 Potentilla anserina 17 Table 1 18 Table 1 RGS16 19 RGS16 RGS16 20 RGS16 RGS16 21 RGS16 The most widely used reagent for detecting mitochondrial ROS is dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123). Rhodamine 123, a dye that specifically stains mitochondria, is reduced to form DHR123 [ 22 23 In this study, we found that ε-viniferin was the major secondary metabolite that reduced mitochondrial ROS production. A reduction in mitochondrial ROS production by ε-viniferin restored mitochondrial function, thereby rejuvenating senescence-associated phenotypes. Through transcriptome analysis, we elucidated the underlying mechanism by which ε-viniferin restores mitochondrial function through the regulation of RGS16 2. Results 2.1. ε-Viniferin Reduces Mitochondrial ROS Levels Secondary metabolites (phillyrin, rosamultin, ε-viniferin) were utilized to identify metabolites that could effectively reduce ROS production in mitochondria ( Table 1 22 24 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 ε-viniferin is a resveratrol dimer composed of two resveratrol molecules. Since resveratrol has a senolytic effect that selectively removes senescent cells [ 25 Figure 1 Figure 1 The discovery that ε-viniferin inhibited the proliferation of senescent fibroblasts led us to determine whether ε-viniferin, like resveratrol, eliminates senescent fibroblasts through apoptosis. Compared with the DMSO control, the 4 μM ε-viniferin significantly increased the apoptosis rate ( Figure 1 The finding that ε-viniferin acts as a senolytics led us to re-examine whether ε-viniferin has senolytic properties that affect only senescent fibroblasts but not non-senescent fibroblasts. The impact of ε-viniferin on the proliferation of young fibroblasts was observed. The proliferation of young fibroblasts was unaffected by 4 μM ε-viniferin when compared with the DMSO control ( Figure 1 2.2. The Mitochondrial Function Is Restored by ε-Viniferin 2.2.1. The Increase in OXPHOS Efficiency by ε-Viniferin Inefficiency in electron transport in the ETC is one of the primary causes of ROS generation in mitochondria [ 26 26 27 28 28 29 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.2.2. The Increase in MMP Levels by ε-Viniferin Efficient electron transport in the ETC generates an electrochemical gradient of proton ions by ETC complexes [ 5 30 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.2.3. The Decrease in the Glycolysis Rate by ε-Viniferin MMP is a motive force that makes it possible for OXPHOS to produce ATP [ 31 28 28 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.2.4. The Decrease in the Basal Proton Efflux Rate by ε-Viniferin Lactate is produced through an inefficient energy metabolism pathway after glycolysis [ 32 33 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.3. ε-Viniferin Activates Mitophagy to Remove Damaged Mitochondria The discovery of ε-viniferin-mediated restoration of mitochondrial function raised questions about the mechanism by which ε-viniferin achieves these effects. Mitophagy removes damaged mitochondria and restores mitochondrial function [ 34 34 35 Figure 3 Figure 3 36 Figure 3 Figure 3 Next, to quantify mitophagy activation by ε-viniferin, autophagic flux was measured. Autophagy flux is the rate at which autophagy removes damaged organelles [ 37 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.4. ε-Viniferin Rejuvenates Senescence-Associated Phenotypes Mitochondrial functional recovery is the prerequisite for regenerating senescent cells into young cells [ 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 Figure 4 Figure 4 Lysosomes filled with lipofuscin serve as a storage site for newly produced hydrolytic enzymes, which results in decreased activity of hydrolytic enzymes and consequently decreased lysosomal activity [ 45 45 Figure 4 Figure 4 Next, we examined how ε-viniferin affects senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), a hallmark of senescence [ 46 Figure 4 Figure 4 2.5. RGS16 Regulates ε-Viniferin-Mediated Mitochondrial ROS Reduction The discovery that ε-viniferin has senescence-rejuvenating properties led us to investigate the genes regulated by ε-viniferin to induce these effects. We analyzed the underlying signaling pathway by RNA sequencing using senescent fibroblasts treated with DMSO or ε-viniferin. Transcriptome expression profiling led to the discovery of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEG analysis identified 31 genes with levels that were more than 2-fold altered compared with the DMSO control ( Figure 5 Table S1 regulator of G protein signaling 16 RGS16 NM_002928 21 Figure 5 Table S1 Figure 5 Table S1 RGS16 Figure 5 RGS16 RGS16 Figure 5 2.6. RGS16 Upregulation Restores Mitochondrial Function The discovery that RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 Figure 6 Next, we examined the effect of RGS16 overexpression on mitochondrial ROS levels. Senescent fibroblasts infected with lentivirus producing RGS16 Figure 6 RGS16 We then looked at the impact of RGS16 47 48 RGS16 Figure 6 RGS16 The discovery that ε-viniferin reduced mitochondrial ROS and mitochondrial mass led us to investigate whether upregulation of RGS16 RGS16 Figure 6 RGS16 3. Discussion The progression of senescence is significantly influenced by damage to cellular organelles, particularly mitochondria, due to ROS-mediated oxidative stress [ 49 50 50 51 52 53 Senolytics and senomorphics are two types of senotherapies used to treat aging [ 54 54 54 55 56 B-cell lymphoma 2 BCL2 57 BCL2 BCL2 57 57 BCL2 BCL2 p53 58 58 59 Plants produce secondary metabolites containing compounds with antioxidant activity, such as phenolic compounds, terpenoids, and alkaloids, to protect against environmental stress [ 60 61 62 63 64 62 63 65 Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 66 67 68 69 The antioxidant and anti-senescence effects of ε-viniferin may be the result of a multifactorial process. For instance, apigenin, a flavonoid present in a variety of vegetables, efficiently scavenges ROS due to the numerous hydroxyl groups in its C-ring [ 70 71 Scutellaria baicalensis 72 interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor-alpha 73 74 RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 75 RGS16 Grapes, particularly Vitis vinifera 76 77 77 76 78 76 78 In conclusion, we found that ε-viniferin is a secondary metabolite that effectively reduces mitochondrial ROS in senescent fibroblasts. The ability of ε-viniferin to reduce mitochondrial ROS production led to the restoration of mitochondrial function and senescence-related phenotypes. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of these effects was based on the upregulation of RGS16 RGS16 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture 4.1.1. Rationale to Use Human Dermal Fibroblasts Human dermal fibroblasts have long been used as an experimental model to study aging and age-related diseases in the scientific community [ 79 80 81 4.1.2. Criteria for Distinguishing Human Skin Fibroblasts into Senescent and Young Fibroblasts Human dermal fibroblasts (PCS-201-010; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured according to a previous study protocol [ 82 83 84 85 86 86 4.1.3. Cell Culture Methods To maintain the concentration of natural compounds applied to the cells for 12 days, the medium was replaced every 4 days with a medium containing each natural compound diluted to 4 µM. On day 12, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 21-031-CVC, Corning, Corning, NY, USA). Then, each analysis was performed according to the procedures mentioned below. 4.2. Preparation of Natural Compounds Phyllirin, rosamultin, and ε-viniferin were isolated from Osmanthus fragrans aurantiacus Rosa rugosa Vitis amurensis 1 13 1 13 Supplementary Materials (Figures S2–S7) 4.3. Analysis of Mitochondrial ROS Using Flow Cytometry Senescent fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (0.01%) or 4 µM natural substances (phyllirin, rosamultin, and ε-viniferin) at 4-day intervals for 12 days. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a medium containing 30 µM DHR123 (10056-1; Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA). For flow cytometry analysis, a FACSCaliber instrument (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was used. Mitochondrial ROS levels were calculated as [DHR123-stained FITC mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)] − [DHR123-unstained FITC MFI]. 4.4. Cell Proliferation Assay Senescent or young fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (0.01%) or ε-viniferin (4 µM) every 4 days for 12 days. As directed by the manufacturer, the EZ-cytox reagent (EZ-5000; DoGe Bio, Seoul, Korea) containing water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) was employed. Since some apoptotic cells were lost during the medium replacement (days 4 and 8) and washing (day 12), cell proliferation was only measured for the remaining cells. 4.5. Apoptosis Assay Senescent fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (0.01%) or ε-viniferin (4 µM) every 4 days for 12 days. As directed by the manufacturer, the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (556547; BD Biosciences) was utilized. Since some apoptotic cells were lost during the medium replacement (days 4 and 8) and washing (day 12), apoptosis rate was only measured for the remaining cells. Therefore, the loss of apoptotic cells during media replacement (days 4 and 8) and washing (day 12) was not reflected in the apoptosis measurements. 4.6. Analysis of Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR), Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR), and Basal Proton Efflux Rate Senescent fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (0.01%) or ε-viniferin (4 µM) every 4 days for 12 days. The Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (101706-100; Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA, USA) was used to measure OCR. The Seahorse XF Glycolytic Rate Assay Kit (103344–100; Seahorse Bioscience) was used to assess ECAR and basal proton efflux rates. OCR and ECAR were measured using a Seahorse Bioscience XFe96 flux analyzer. Briefly, 5 × 10 4 2 4.7. Flow Cytometric Analysis of MMP, Mitochondrial Mass, Lysosomal Mass, Autofluorescence, and Autophagic Flux Senescent fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (0.01%) or ε-viniferin (4 µM) at 4-day intervals for 12 days. MMP, mitochondrial mass, and lysosomal mass were measured by treating senescent fibroblasts in medium containing each dye for 30 min at 37 °C ( Table 2 87 4.8. Immunofluorescence Senescent fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (0.01%) or ε-viniferin (4 µM) every 4 days for 12 days. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (X100RS; Sigma) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (252549; Sigma) in PBS for 15 min. For 1 h at RT, blocking was carried out using PBS containing 10% FBS. Following the addition of primary antibodies, the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT following three rounds of washing with ice-cold PBS. The ProLong Gold Antifade reagent ( P36934 R37606 Table 3 4.9. Senescent Associated β–Galactosidase (SA-β-gal) Staining Senescent fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (0.01%) or ε-viniferin (4 µM) every 4 days for 12 days. As directed by the manufacturer, SA-β-gal staining was carried out (9860; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 5 min and then stained overnight at 37 °C with freshly prepared SA-β-gal staining solution. The percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells among total cells in randomly selected fields was calculated. 4.10. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Senescent fibroblasts were treated with DMSO (0.01%) or ε-viniferin (4 µM) every 4 days for 12 days. The RNase Mini Kit (74104; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract total RNA from 1 × 10 6 TM GAPDH GAPDH RGS16 RGS16 RGS16 36B4 RGS16 −ΔΔCt 4.11. Transcriptome Expression Profiling Senescent fibroblasts were administered DMSO (0.01%) or ε-viniferin (4 µM) at 4-day intervals for 12 days. For transcriptome expression profiling, total RNA was extracted using the RNase Mini Kit (74104; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Illumina platform using TruSeq Small RNA was used to find the expression (paired-end) of the generated transcripts. Contamination artifacts were removed to improve the analysis of the raw reads obtained during the sequencing process. HISAT2 (version 2.1.0; Johns Hopkins University Center for Computational Biology, Baltimore, MD, USA) was used to map the cleaned reads to the Homo sapiens (GRCh38, NCBI_109.20200522) genome. Then, the transcriptome was assembled using StringTie (version 2.1.3b; Johns Hopkins University Center for Computational Biology). Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes. All samples were analyzed in biological triplicate. A p 4.12. Lenti–Viral Production and Infection Using Lipofectamine 2000 (11668019; Invitrogen), 8 μg of plasmids ( pLenti-control pLen-ti-RGS16 88 4.13. Statistics In the experiments measuring OCR and ECAR, data were collected through five biological replicates. Except for the OCR and ECAR experiments, data were collected through three biological replicates. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 10 (San Diego, CA, USA). Shapiro–Wilk and Levene tests were performed to test for normality and equality of variances, respectively. When the assumptions of normality and equality of variances were not met, the nonparametric alternative, the Mann–Whitney U test, was used. When the assumptions of normality and equality of variances were met, a two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used. The type of error was shown as a standard deviation.
