The lack of timely medical support leads to frequent Accident and Emergency Department (AED) attendance, prolonged hospitalizations, and discharge problems. Integrated Care at Home (ICAH) program aims to support aging in place by establishing an on-site, need-based, integrated medical care model, so as to reduce hospital burden and caregiver stress. Methods The ICAH program serves community-dwelling frail elderly who are bedridden, functionally dependent, in need of intensive medical and nursing care, and with frequent or prolonged hospitalizations, by providing regular on-site community nurse and geriatrician visits, ad-hoc consultations and caregiver support. This retrospective observational study included patients recruited to ICAH between February 1, 2018 to August 31, 2023. We reviewed our service provision, patients’ demographics, 180-day AED visits and hospitalization days, and caregivers’ 3-month Relative Stress Scale. Results Seventy-six patients were recruited with a median age of 90 and a median Clinical Frailty Scale of 8. Among them, 92% had advanced dementia, 30% had deep pressure injuries, and 43% had recurrent sepsis within a year; 3.7 nursing and 0.4 medical visits were delivered per patient per month. The 180-day AED attendance rates decreased from 15.3 to 3.2 per 1,000 PD (patient days) (p<0.001). Rates of hospitalization days decreased from 266.4 to 29.7 per 1,000 PD (p<0.001). Median Relative Stress Scale decreased from 24.5 to 16 (p=0.001) at 3 months. Conclusion The ICAH program is able to facilitate community care for the very frail elderly, significantly reducing their AED attendance, hospital stay, and caregiver stress.

The proportion of elderly aged 65 or above is projected to increase from 20.5% in 2021 to 36.0% in 2046. 1 2 3 4 Frail elderly often present with complicated medical problems such as recurrent sepsis, feeding problems, pressure injuries, etc., 5 7 8 Residential care homes have more readily available nursing staff for various kinds of nursing care procedures. In Hong Kong, they are often supported by the regional hospital’s Community Geriatric Assessment Team for chronic disease management, and by visiting doctors who manage patients’ episodic illnesses. On the other hand, a service gap exists for frail older adults residing in community. Often the complexity of their medical problems lays beyond the scope of primary care, yet follow-ups in specialty clinics are relatively infrequent and such patients usually have difficulty traveling to hospitals. Community nursing services can provide task-based nursing procedures, yet unable to manage patients’ complex medical needs. As a result, this gap leads to low threshold for AED attendance, frequent hospitalizations and discharge problems. The New Territories West Cluster of Hong Kong provides medical services to a population of 1.1 million people with Tuen Mun Hospital being its major regional hospital. In view of such a service gap and that a new service model is deemed necessary to cater the rising demand, the geriatric team of Tuen Mun Hospital has developed the Integrated Care at Home (ICAH) program since 2018, aiming to establish an on-site, need-based, integrated model to facilitate frail elderly care in the community, so as to support aging in place. We also target to reduce AED attendance and hospital stay, empower caregivers, and relieve carer stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS Program Design and Services ICAH program is a geriatrician-led, multidisciplinary, case-manager based program, that works under close collaboration with community nursing services. Cases are recruited through proactive screening. Inclusion criteria include community-dwelling older adults with advanced frailty under the care of Tuen Mun Hospital geriatric team, who are chair- to bedridden and functionally dependent with a Clinical Frailty Scale of at least 7, 9 Under ICAH program, a designated community nurse will be assigned as the case manager for each patient. Regular nursing visits and on-site follow-up by geriatricians are provided. General nursing services include wound care, medication management, support on medical devices, etc., while specialized wound nurse visits could be arranged for complicated wounds. Medical follow-up includes chronic disease management, medication reconciliation and symptom control, etc. Nursing visits could be as frequent as daily if required, otherwise typically once every 2–4 weeks. Medical visits are individualized, but typically once every 2–3 months. Ad-hoc nursing phone consultations are available within office hours, further supported by ad-hoc medical on-site or tele-consultations if needed, which could usually be arranged within 1–3 days. Community allied health services would be referred if required after comprehensive geriatric assessment. More complex interventions could be carried out at home, such as subcutaneous fluids infusion, intravenous medications, and more complex wound management. With adequate support and education, caregivers are empowered to perform procedures like oropharyngeal suction or use of narcotics in palliative care. Clinical admissions to designated geriatric wards could be arranged if necessary. Admitted cases are co-managed with the hospital team, and early post-discharge support is provided. Collaborated services with the Integrated Discharge Support Program for elderly (IDSP) for transitional care could be provided, which is a pre-existing multidisciplinary post-discharge program but with the lack of direct medical support. Community support would be further tailored by need via liaison with medical-social collaboration services, through referrals to medical social workers and non-government organizations that provide home care support services. Case conferences are held regularly to review the progress of each case. Advanced care planning is proactively discussed with all cases who are ready for discussion, and peri-bereavement and dying in place support are provided to families in need. Recruited cases are followed until patients either pass away or move to residential care homes, or when they no long require intensive medical support. Study Design and Data Collection In this retrospective observational study, data of all patients recruited into ICAH program from February 1, 2018 till August 31, 2023 were reviewed, and data up to February 29, 2024 were retrieved. Patients’ demographic information, consultation records and admission records were obtained from the Hospital Authority’s electronic patient records. Patients’ clinical outcomes, including institutionalization, change of feeding mode, mortality, place of death, and any resuscitation received, would be reviewed. Advanced dementia was defined as Reisberg Functional Assessment Screening Tool (FAST) staging of least 7a. 10 11 12 Outcomes Primary outcomes were patients’ 180-day AED attendance and hospitalization days before and after program recruitment, which was obtained by dividing the total outcome counts by the total number of surviving observation days, then multiplied by 1,000 patient days (PD) and were compared by incidence rates. The total observation days for AED attendance excluded the count of hospitalization days as patients would not be at risk for AED attendance while being hospitalized. Secondary outcome was the major caregivers’ stress burden as assessed by Relative Stress Scale (RSS) at baseline and at 3-month post recruitment, which is a 15-item questionnaire focusing on different aspects of perceived carer stress. 13 Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Window version 22.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All continuous variables in this study had skewed distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), while categorical variables were expressed as numbers with percentages (%). Incidence rates were presented with 95% confidence interval (CI) by Poisson distribution, and were compared using chi-square test. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare non-parametric continuous data. All statistical tests were two-sided and p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS Study Population and Baseline Characteristics From February 1, 2018 to August 31, 2023, 76 cases were recruited with a median age of 90 and a median Clinical Frailty Scale of 8, which indicates very severe frailty ( Table 1 Program-Related Service Provision and Clinical Outcomes As of February 29, 2024, a median of 0.4 on-site medical visits and 3.7 nursing visits were paid to each patient per month; 0.4 ad-hoc nursing phone consultations and 0.1 ad-hoc medical consultations were delivered per patient per month ( Table 2 A total of 165 ad-hoc medical consultations and 35 clinical admissions were provided, with reasons shown in Tables 3 4 As of February 29, 2024, 66 patients were discharged from the ICAH program, among whom four had moved to residential care homes, two were discharged as they no longer required intensive medical and nursing support, and continued routine follow-up in our specialty clinic. The remaining 60 patients passed away, of which 30 died within 180 days after recruitment. The median survival among those who died was 5.6 months (IQR 2–15.7) after recruitment. Among the 60 patients who passed away, 31 (51.7%) died in a geriatric ward, while 9 (15%) died in non-geriatric wards; 17 (28.3%) died in AED, and 2 (3.3%) died at home. Dying in place support was provided to 3 patients (3.9%) during their last journey of life. The most common cause of death was pneumonia, which occurred in 54 patients (90%); 38 (63.3%) did not receive any cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or intubation, while 22 (36.7%) received invasive resuscitation, most of which occurred on ambulance or in AED. Eleven patients with a valid DNACPR Form for non-hospitalized patients received CPR on ambulance, after which nine of them were terminated after arrival to AED. Study Outcomes The rates of AED attendance and hospitalization days 180 days pre- and post-program were shown in Table 5 DISCUSSION In this retrospective before-and-after study we recruited 76 patients who are amongst the oldest and frailest with intensive medical needs, with an average of one AED visit and 38 hospitalization days over the past 6 months. After recruitment into ICAH program, there was a significant reduction in AED attendance and hospital stay, and their caregivers had a lower RSS score. This is a relatively small-scale study but is also one of the first published data exploring the efficacy of home-based medical care models designated for severely frail older adults in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, about 90% of inpatient services are managed by public hospitals 14 14 9 Various international studies have demonstrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of integrated home-based medical services, including home-based primary care and palliative care programs, on reducing hospital attendance and medical costs. 15 16 17 18 A home-based palliative care program for older adults in the United States resulted in a reduction of hospitalization days from 6.59 to 1.46 days, and a non-significant reduction of AED visits from 0.23 to 0.11 in 6 months. 19 20 21 20 Similarly, even though many home-based primary care programs resulted in reduced hospital attendance, their baseline AED visits and hospital stay are still significantly less than those of this study, as their patients are younger and with better functional status. 22 23 24 Our study provides valuable insights on how dying in place is a challenge in Hong Kong. A local study revealed that up to 31% patients would opt to die at home, 8 14 25 26 There was also unfortunately a significant number of patients who had a valid DNACPR Form for non-hospitalized patients, but were still given CPR on ambulance under the constraint of Fire Services Ordinance of Hong Kong, which specifically indicates the duty of Fire Services Department to assist any person who needs immediate medical attention by resuscitating or sustaining one’s life. 27 28 29 The baseline RSS score among our caregivers was 24.5, higher than the cutoff of 23, indicating an increased risk of clinically significant psychological distress. 30 31 32 33 One major limitation of our study is that it was retrospective and there was no control group nor randomization, so we could not prove the causal relationship between ICAH program and the reduction in hospital attendance. The sample size was small and it only covered patients in a territorial hospital, so results may not be generalizable to other parts of Hong Kong. In fact, the study population was confined to a highly selected group where there was good family support and dedicated caregivers to start with. The small sample size also limits the possibility of a comprehensive cost-effective analysis. Moreover, RSS has not been validated in Chinese, and RSS focuses on psychological stress but no other aspects such as financial burden or perceived health status. Qualitative assessment of caregiver burden has recently been switched to a validated Chinese version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview, 34 ICAH is still an ongoing program and we have been modifying and optimizing our services constantly. At the moment we are trying to utilize more telemedicine to minimize unnecessary travelling time, and implementing more use of gerontechnology to facilitate remote patient care. We hope that by running and expanding the program in a sustainable way we can facilitate aging in place for more frail older adults. In conclusion, ICAH program demonstrated positive effects in reducing AED visits and hospital stay for very frail older patients while alleviating caregiver burden. A larger scale, prospective study with a control group may be considered in future to further establish the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the program.
