Introduction Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects more than 250 million people worldwide and remains the leading cause of viral liver disease [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 The M1GS ribozyme, which fuses the catalytic RNA subunit (M1 RNA) of ribonuclease P (RNase P) from Escherichia coli 9 10 11 9 2. Hepatitis B Virus HBV is a hepatotropic DNA virus that infects more than 250 million people chronically worldwide and is the leading viral cause of liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma [ 1 3 4 2 12 13 Figure 1 12 14 13 15 After the rcDNA enters the hepatocyte’s nucleus, host DNA repair machinery converts it into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) [ 2 12 Figure 1 16 17 16 17 2 12 18 Figure 1 12 19 2 Current treatments target HBV at three levels: (i) the protein level, (ii) the enzymatic level, and (iii) the DNA level [ 20 2 12 20 21 22 23 24 2 3. Nucleic Acid-Based Gene Targeting Agents for Therapy of HBV Infections and Diseases Among the nucleic acid-based gene targeting strategies, RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR-Cas9 systems have remained popular options. RNAi, similar to M1GS, offers multi-turnover potential [ 6 7 25 Table 1 26 Table 1 27 27 26 28 29 The application of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in treating HBV has been primarily focused on the cleavage of cccDNA ( Table 1 30 Streptococcus thermophilus 30 Table 1 26 31 31 M1GS represents a highly programmable alternative to current nucleic acid-based gene interference strategies [ 9 6 7 32 10 33 molecules-30-03725-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Clinical and preclinical advances in nucleic acid-based and gene-editing therapeutic strategies against HBV. Approach Target Specificity Delivery Challenges Clinical Stage Results Key Advantages Key Limitations Reference Meganucleases P ORF High Used lipid nanoparticles for mRNA delivery. Need for efficient liver targeting. Preclinical Resulted in ~85% reduction in cccDNA and reduced HBV DNA by 80% Highly specific DNA recognition and cleavage. Compact size (mRNA delivery) allows for various delivery methods. Can be engineered to enhance specificity, thereby reducing off-target effects. Complex engineering process and potential for DNA integration at cut sites. Efficacy depends on optimization and limited flexibility in target site selection. [ 34 ZFNs P, C, and X ORFs Generally high, but can vary Two-component system limits packaging capacity (requires two scAAV vectors). There is a need for efficient liver targeting and co-delivery of both components. Preclinical Complete inhibition of HBV DNA replication and production of virions for at least 2 weeks after treatment. Highly specific DNA recognition and cleavage. Customizable specificity and flexible target selection through modifying/swapping zinc finger modules. Complex design process, potential off-target effects, cytotoxicity (ZFN2), varying efficacy across HBV genotypes (may require optimization for variants). Properties of zinc finger domains result in a preference for targeting sequences containing GNN, ANN, or CNN triplets. [ 35 36 TALENs Conserved regions of P and C ORFs of multiple HBV genotypes (A-D) High Large size limits delivered options (hydrodynamic injection used in this study). Adenovirus/AAV vectors can also be used for hepatic delivery. Preclinical Reduced core protein expression by ~79% and HBV DNA levels by ~73%. Decreased cccDNA by ~10–20%. Highly specific DNA recognition and cleavage. Shown to be synergistic when combined with IFN-α, an HBV antiviral, and was effective against multiple HBV genotypes. Large size complicates efficient delivery to hepatocytes. It requires two TALENs to bind near each other. Efficacy varies depending on target sequences (potential for nucleosome positioning to interfere with cccDNA binding) [ 37 ASOs (Bepirovirsen) A 20-nucleotide sequence present in all HBV mRNA and pgRNA High 2′-O-methoxyethyl modification to enhance stability against nuclease degradation. Subcutaneous injection of lipid nanoparticles. Phase III ( NCT04449029 9–10% achieved primary endpoint (HBsAg loss and undetectable HBV DNA at week 24 post-treatment) Proven to be effective in combination with other antiviral NA therapies. Rapid viral response was observed in some patients. Limited efficacy, with only 9–10% of patients achieving the primary endpoint. Weekly injections are required, with a likely need for repeated dosages to achieve a functional cure. [ 38 39 RNAi (JNJ-3989) Targets X and S ORFs High GalNAc-conjugated siRNA for targeted liver delivery is administered through subcutaneous injection. The main delivery challenge is maintaining therapeutic levels over time. Phase II ( NCT04129554 JNJ-3989 + Bersacapavir (HBV core protein inhibitor) + NA reduced HBsAg by ~98% at the end of treatment compared to ~13% in the control (NA only). At week 24 post-treatment, 81.5% of patients maintained at least a 90% reduction. The use of GalNAc made these siRNAs highly tissue-specific. RNAi generally offers high specificity and has been proven effective in combination with other antivirals. The small size of RNAi allows for various delivery methods A functional cure was not achieved in this study. Suppression was not completely maintained in all patients post-treatment. High concentrations of RNAi can potentially cause off-target effects, which may partly account for the grade 3 or 4 adverse events observed in this study (~15% of patients) [ 28 29 40 41 CRISPR/Cas9 (Non-cleavage Base Editing) P and S ORFs High Lentiviral transduction in cell culture. Large size makes delivery challenging in vivo. Preclinical HBV DNA decreased by more than 60%. ~25%–35% C→T conversion at target sites for cccDNA and ~35%–80% C→T conversion at target sites for integrated HBV DNA. Avoids DSBs and potential chromosomal translocations that could be caused by WT CRISPR/Cas9 systems cleaving integrated HBV DNA. Capable of targeting both cccDNA and integrated HBV DNA, allowing for permanent inactivation of HBV. The large size of Cas9 Base editors makes in vivo delivery challenging. They share the same off-target challenges as WT Cas9, with the risk of generating nonsense mutations in the host genome. The potential effects of truncated HBV proteins are unknown. [ 42 M1GS Overlapping region of pgRNA, S mRNA, and pre-S/L mRNA. High Plasmid transfection in cell culture. Large size makes delivery challenging in vivo. Preclinical ~82% reduction of HBV RNA, ~80% reduction in HBsAG and HBeAg, and ~300-fold decrease in HBV DNA. High specificity is achieved due to structure recognition during cleavage. Mismatches that might be tolerated in other sequence-based systems are avoided. M1GS are highly modular and can be optimized through in vitro selection. This study utilized WT M1 RNA, allowing for efficacy improvement through an in vitro selection process. The large size of M1GS makes delivery in vivo challenging. Tissue specificity, a challenge in M1GS delivery, can be addressed through tailored strategies; however, this compromises the highly programmable nature and flexibility that make M1GS a desirable therapeutic. [ 43 4. RNase P and Its Catalytic RNA Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a holoenzyme found in all domains of life, responsible for cleaving the 5′ leader sequence from tRNA precursors and other small RNAs [ 10 44 45 Escherichia coli 10 46 M1GS utilizes M1 RNA from Escherichia coli 11 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 10 11 44 56 57 Escherichia coli 46 58 In a groundbreaking study of M1 RNA, it was demonstrated that M1 RNA is capable of cleaving pre-tRNA in the absence of the protein subunit under high M g 2 + 49 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 5. RNase P Substrate Recognition and Engineering of Gene-Targeting Ribozymes from RNase P RNA 5.1. Structural Basis of Substrate Recognition RNase P acts on substrates that share structural motifs such as the T-stem/loop, elements resembling the acceptor stem, and unpaired 5′ leaders, which are highlighted in Figure 2 10 11 44 45 59 60 Figure 2 59 61 Figure 2 9 10 11 5.2. Engineering Principles for M1GS Ribozymes EGS has been applied to HBV, where EGS constructs were designed to target the overlapping region of the S mRNA, pre-S/l mRNA, and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) using Salmonella 62 63 63 Salmonella 62 10 44 45 Shared RNA structure of EGS and M1 RNA led to the development of M1GS, which combines the EGS substrate recognition with RNase P’s catalytic M1 RNA ( Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 M g 2 + 33 55 64 65 46 65 66 67 6. In Vitro Evolution of RNase P Ribozyme with Improved Gene Targeting Activity M1GS’s catalytic efficiency and binding affinity can be optimized through an in vitro evolution/selection process [ 68 69 70 Figure 4 Figure 4 71 72 Figure 4 71 72 M g 2 + Figure 4 Figure 4 71 72 In vitro selection processes [ 71 72 71 73 71 71 7. Inhibition of HBV Gene Expression and Growth by M1GS RNA Chronic HBV infection is sustained through covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes [ 16 17 24 Figure 1 12 18 2 12 19 Figure 1 RNase P ribozymes targeting HBV were investigated by using M1GS targeting the overlapping region of HBV S mRNA, pre-S/L mRNA, and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) [ 43 43 43 43 8. Advantages and Disadvantages of M1GS RNAs M1GS stands out from other therapeutic approaches due to several unique strengths. For example, classical antisense oligonucleotides rely on host RNase H to degrade RNA-DNA hybrids while carrying the risk of non-target cleavage due to RNase H’s tolerance to imperfect base pairing [ 6 7 74 9 75 33 76 77 Escherichia coli 46 65 66 67 Significant challenges remain when considering the therapeutic application of M1GS. One concern is the limited research available to fully understand the potential unintended effects of M1GS overexpression on cellular physiology. If expressed at high levels, M1GS could interfere with human RNase P and its associated pathways [ 46 7 78 33 79 9. Future Direction and Challenges First, future directions could involve enhancing the compatibility of M1GS with human RNase P proteins and optimizing the catalytic core of M1 RNA itself. This can be achieved through an in vitro selection process ( Figure 3 71 72 Second, future studies could investigate the delivery of M1GS. Previous studies have successfully utilized attenuated Salmonella 62 63 33 80 81 82 80 26 83 Recent advances in non-viral delivery platforms such as engineered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and exosome-based carriers have demonstrated the capacity to deliver larger RNA molecules, often several kilobases in length, far exceeding the approximately 400-nucleotide length of M1GS [ 84 85 84 84 84 85 85 Third, future studies will focus on improving the safety profile of M1GS in vivo. For example, the pharmacokinetic properties of M1GS require investigation. The distribution and turnover of M1GS in vivo should be studied. Substantial progress has recently been made in reducing the immunogenicity and immunotoxicity of RNA molecules by incorporating various modifications into chemically or T7 RNA polymerase-synthesized RNA molecules (e.g., 1-methyl-pseudouridine) and developing nanoparticles for exogenous RNA delivery [ 86 87 To improve M1GS specificity and reduce its potential off-target effects, ribozymes with enhanced sequence specificity and catalytic activity can be constructed by engineering the M1GS substrate and catalytic domains, followed by refinement through in vitro selection procedures ( Figure 4 Fourth, future studies could explore the potential of M1GS in combination therapy for HBV. Many clinical trials are currently investigating the combination of nucleic acid-based therapeutics with approved antivirals, such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs), with the aim of enhancing antiviral potency by combining strategies that act through different mechanisms. For example, the antisense oligonucleotide Bepirovirsen, which targets HBV mRNA through an RNase H-mediated mechanism, achieved a greater reduction in HBsAg when used alongside NAs ( Table 1 40 Finally, future studies could investigate pgRNA target sites beyond the overlapping regions conducted in the studies thus far. For example, overlapping regions involving other essential open reading frames, such as X ORF, could be investigated. The X gene encodes HBx, a multi-functional protein in HBV that promotes histone acetylation to decondense cccDNA and inhibits the tumor suppressor p53, often referred to as the “guardian of the genome” [ 88 89 88 90 10. Conclusions In this review, we have discussed the gene-targeting capability of M1GS RNA, an engineered ribozyme derived from the catalytic RNA of bacterial RNase P. Using HBV infection as an example, we have examined the structure and function of M1GS ribozyme, its engineered form, and its potential antiviral applications. We explored how M1GS can cleave essential viral transcripts such as pgRNA and overlapping regions of the S and pre-S/L mRNAs, allowing for simultaneous interference with transcription, translation, and cccDNA replenishment through a single cleavage event. We have also explored future directions, including optimization of M1 RNA, compatibility with human RNase P proteins, improvements in delivery, and expansion of target sites. M1GS RNAs, characterized by their versatility and structure-based recognition, represent an exciting therapeutic prospect in gene-targeted antiviral therapy.

HBV relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) is converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus, which serves as a template for transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). pgRNA has dual roles as the template for reverse transcription into rcDNA and as mRNA for viral proteins (polymerase, core, surface, and HBx proteins). M1GS targets overlapping regions of HBV mRNA and pgRNA, resulting in their cleavage and degradation. M1GS directly inhibits translation and reverse transcription, which in turn prevents cccDNA replenishment and the production of new virions. Figure 2 Substrates for RNase P and M1GS RNA.
