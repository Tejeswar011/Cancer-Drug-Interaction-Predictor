Current mitochondrial-targeted strategies have failed to restore the mitochondrial impaired function effectively. Mitochondrial transplantation technology has brought a revolution to the treatment of organelle-related diseases. Here, we first summarize the therapeutic potential and available platforms for mitochondrial transplantation, and focus on a type of mitochondrial transplantation technology mediated by tunneling nanotubes. This technology transfers functional mitochondria from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to CD8 + the Noncommunicable Chronic Diseases-National Science and Technology Major Project 2023ZD0500700 Wenguo Cui the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission 2022XD055 Wenguo Cui pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes T Cell Exhaustion and Mitochondrial Targeting Strategies in Tumor Immunity Tumor immunotherapy activates and enhances the patient’s own immune system to identify and eliminate tumor cells, offering precise and durable effects that are difficult to achieve with traditional treatments such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Among these therapies, T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy plays a crucial role. The antitumor efficacy and metabolic adaptability of T cells are key determinants of the success of tumor immunotherapy. Numerous studies have demonstrated that a higher level of T cell infiltration correlates positively with a good prognosis in patients with various cancers, such as breast, lung, colorectal, and melanoma [ 1 2 1 2 3 4 5 Mitochondrial transplantation has recently emerged as a transformative approach for treating organelle-related diseases. By delivering healthy mitochondria into damaged cells, this strategy can replace or repair impaired mitochondria, restoring key processes such as respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation [ 6 7 Cell + Potential Applications and Technology Platforms for Mitochondrial Transplantation Baldwin et al. [ 7 8 6 9 Mitochondrial transplantation can be classified as artificial or natural. In the artificial approach, mitochondria are isolated from healthy tissues and delivered into damaged sites through regional or systemic injection to supplement or replace dysfunctional networks. Beyond traditional methods such as direct injection, co-incubation, centrifugation, and magnetic delivery, platforms for mitochondrial purification and transplantation are now steadily advancing. For example, FluidFM technology combines the high-precision mechanical modulation of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a nanoscale microfluidic system under optical detection to realize the mechanical and quantitative volume control associated with single-cell manipulation. The technique is capable of extracting, injecting, and transplanting organelles from living cells at subcellular spatial resolution, successfully realizing mitochondrial transplantation between living cells [ 10 11 12 7 1 Fig. 1.

Created in BioRender Intercellular Nanotube-Mediated Mitochondrial Transplantation “Supercharges” T Cells Intercellular TNTs are F-actin-based cellular protrusions that mediate the transfer of membranes, cytoplasmic components, and organelles for long-distance intercellular communication connections [ 12 13 7 Cell 1 + 2 + + + − 2 + 2 + 2 Fig. 2. Intercellular nanotube-mediated mitochondrial transfer enhances T cell metabolic adaptability and antitumor efficacy. (A) Field-emission scanning electron microscopy images show nanotubes (yellow arrows) between BMSCs and CD8 + + + + + + − + − + 7 Of course, mitochondrial transfer for intercellular communication exists between a variety of cells. For example, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can support endothelial cell (EC) engraftment into ischemic tissues and promote the formation of functional blood vessels through mitochondrial transfer. Interestingly, this effect is transient: Exogenous mitochondria in ECs rapidly undergo mitophagy, leading to a “regression” of mitochondrial content and ATP production. This “regression” is critical for EC implantation, as knockdown of key components mediating mitochondrial autophagy with short hairpin RNAs inhibits successful EC implantation. Remarkably, even transfection of activity-deficient mitochondria (depolarized or mtDNA-less mitochondria) exerted the same effect, and exogenous mitochondria did not integrate with the mitochondrial pool of endogenous ECs [ 14 7 + + + + 2+ 15 Furthermore, in Baldwin et al.’s [ 7 + + + + + + + 16 + Discussion and Outlook This outstanding study reveals the potential of mitochondrial transplantation to restore T cell metabolic adaptation and function, and to enhance antitumor responses in animal models. It offers a new conceptual and technological framework for the application of organelle-based medicine in cancer immunotherapy. However, its long-term stability and clinical translatability remain to be validated. TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer takes advantage of cell’s endogenous communication and avoids risks such as membrane damage and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with artificial transplantation. Yet, its efficiency is low (~10%) and the regulatory mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Elucidating the specific molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial transfer mediated by TLN2 (such as which motor proteins are recruited and how they interact with mitochondrial outer membrane proteins) will be a key breakthrough in improving efficiency. In the future, biomaterials or small-molecule agonists could be used to promote and stabilize TNT network formation during T cell expansion in vitro or adoptive therapy in vivo, thereby achieving an “engineered” improvement in mitochondrial transfer efficiency. This strategy of combining endogenous mechanism (TNTs) with exogenous regulation (biomaterials/molecules) may be more controllable and have more application potential than relying solely on gene editing or traditional drug intervention. In addition, using synthetic biology to engineer mitochondria, such as embedding anti-apoptotic proteins or metabolic enzymes into donor mitochondria, to endow T cells with the ability to resist acidification/hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment and develop “super donor” cells also holds broad prospects. It will be important to explore the generalizability of mitochondrial transplantation platforms in future studies. For example, applying this technology to other immune cells prone to exhaustion or functional defects (such as regulatory T cells, natural killer cells, TILs, and dendritic cells) could empower them and broaden the scope and depth of mitochondrial transplantation in tumor immunity. In addition, T cell immunosenescence commonly arises within the TIME, influencing cancer prognosis and the efficacy of immunotherapy [ 17 17 18 19 Acknowledgments Funding: Competing interests: References 1.
