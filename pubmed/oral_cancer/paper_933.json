Introduction Human exploration of extreme environments, from the vastness of space to the depths of the ocean and the extremes of physical exertion, presents unparalleled physiological challenges. Extreme environments are habitats or conditions that pose significant physical, chemical, or biological challenges to life, often pushing the limits of survival and adaptation. These environments can be external, such as those encountered during polar missions, space exploration, or deep-sea activities (i.e., scuba diving, freediving) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 1 2 3 Omics technologies, which encompasses genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, provide a powerful toolkit for dissecting these complex adaptations at a molecular level. By integrating data across these different omics layers, we can gain a holistic understanding of the interplay between genes, proteins, metabolites, and the microbiome in response to extreme stressors [ 1 3 4 5 6 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 This review integrates and compares findings across a diverse range of extreme phenotypes, each representing a unique set of physiological challenges, aiming to uncover shared adaptive mechanisms and pathways, as well as phenotype-specific responses. By synthesizing this knowledge, we aim to provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions and personalized strategies to mitigate risks and optimize human performance and resilience in extreme environments, with particular relevance to long-duration spaceflight and other challenging scenarios. 2. Extreme Phenotypes This section details known and investigated responses to various physiological stressors (Extreme Phenotypes), as well as gaps for future research. 2.1. Astronauts Spaceflight exposes individuals to a wide variety of stressors, including microgravity, radiation, confinement, general physiological and psychological stress, confinement, altered day/night cycle exposure, and viral reactivation [ 1 Genomics: 2 1 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 10 Transcriptomics: 2 11 12 Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Microbiome: 3 13 1 2 3 11 14 15 1 7 16 17 16 17 18 Gaps and Future Directions: Phenotype-specific adaptations 6 18 2.2. Scuba Divers Scuba diving exposes the human body to a unique combination of stressors, including hyperbaric pressure, altered respiratory gas mixtures, cold temperatures, and increased physical exertion [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 20 Genomics: Transcriptomics: 21 22 23 Proteomics: 20 20 24 26 24 Metabolomics: 27 28 Metagenomics: 29 30 Gaps and Future Directions: Phenotype-specific adaptations : 2.3. Long-Haul Airplane Passengers We define a long-haul flight as a flight that lasts more than six hours, to concur with definitions commonly used in the analysis of aerospace physiology. Long-haul air travel presents a unique set of physiological challenges, distinct from other extreme activities discussed in this review. (1) The low-humidity environment in airplane cabins contributes to dehydration and dry skin [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 Genomics and Transcriptomics: 40 41 42 43 Proteomics and Metabolomics: 40 Metagenomics: Gaps and Future Directions: By addressing these research gaps, we can gain a deeper understanding of the physiological and molecular adaptations to long-haul air travel, paving the way for personalized strategies to enhance passenger health and well-being and reduce thrombosis risk. These insights can also inform strategies for mitigating the negative impacts of prolonged confinement and disrupted circadian rhythms, relevant to other extreme environments, including spaceflight. Phenotype-specific adaptations : 2.4. Bodybuilders Bodybuilding represents a human phenotype characterized by extreme muscle hypertrophy achieved through a rigorous combination of resistance training, hormesis, and precisely planned nutrition. This unique phenotype offers a valuable model for investigating the complex interplay of genetics, exercise, and nutrition in promoting muscle growth and adaptation. While most omics studies in this area have focused on the effects of short-term resistance training or comparisons between trained and untrained individuals, rather than focusing specifically on competitive bodybuilders, they nonetheless provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this extreme phenotype. Genomics and Muscle Growth: 44 45 46 Transcriptomic Responses to Resistance Training: 47 48 49 Proteomic Adaptations: 50 51 51 52 53 Metabolomic and Metagenomic Considerations: 54 55 56 57 58 59 Gaps and Future Directions: By addressing these gaps, we can gain a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle hypertrophy in bodybuilders, with implications for developing targeted interventions to maximize muscle growth while mitigating potential health risks. Phenotype-specific adaptations : 2.5. Simulation Racers Competitive simulator racing, particularly in the realm of motorsport, has rapidly gained popularity, providing a unique platform for both amateur and professional drivers to hone their skills and compete in virtual environments. While real-world motorsport has been the prior subject of physiological studies, the specific demands and potential health implications of competitive simulator racing remain largely unexplored from a multi-omics or physiological perspective. This represents a significant gap in our understanding of human adaptation to extreme performance in virtual environments. Physiological Demands and Cognitive Characteristics: 60 60 Beyond cognitive demands, competitive simulator racing also involves sustained periods of intense focus and concentration, often lasting for several hours. This prolonged mental exertion can lead to fatigue and stress, which may have both acute and long-term health consequences. The physical demands, while less intense than real-world racing, still involve sustained muscle activation for controlling the steering wheel, pedals, and other input devices. This can result in localized muscle fatigue, particularly in the hands, arms, and shoulders, as well as potential for repetitive strain injuries. Existing Physiological Studies and Limitations: 61 62 63 Multi-Omics Profiling: Future Research Directions: By addressing these research gaps, we can gain valuable insights into the physiological and molecular underpinnings of performance in virtual motorsport, with potential implications for optimizing training strategies, mitigating health risks, and understanding the broader implications of prolonged engagement in virtual environments. Furthermore, the unique characteristics of simulator racing, such as its controlled environment and accessibility, make it a valuable model for studying the broader aspects of human adaptation to extreme performance and stress in the digital age. Phenotype-specific adaptations : 2.6. Acute Alcohol Consumption Acute alcohol consumption, defined as consuming a large amount of alcohol in a short period leading to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08 g/dL or higher, is a prevalent public health concern. Even in individuals without alcohol use disorder, acute alcohol exposure can induce significant physiological and molecular changes, impacting various organ systems and pathways. Omics research offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying these changes and their potential long-term consequences. Genomic and Epigenetic Influences: 64 65 66 Transcriptomic Responses in Brain and Liver: 67 68 69 70 71 Proteomic and Post-Translational Modifications: 72 73 Metabolomic Shifts: 74 75 Metagenomic Disruptions: 76 77 Gaps and Future Directions: By addressing these gaps, we can gain a more complete picture of the molecular underpinnings of drinking alcohol and its impact on human health, ultimately informing the development of more effective strategies for prevention and treatment. Phenotype-specific adaptations: Table 1 3. Cross-Phenotype Analysis and Integrated Insights: Shared Adaptations and Unique Challenges The diverse array of extreme phenotypes examined in this review, while each presenting unique physiological challenges, also reveals shared adaptive mechanisms and common molecular pathways activated in response to extreme stressors. Integrating insights across these different phenotypes can provide a more holistic understanding of human resilience and adaptability, and offers potential for leveraging knowledge from one phenotype to inform research and intervention strategies for another.  Shared Adaptations: A recurring theme across these various stressors is the activation of generalized stress response pathways. However, a deeper molecular analysis reveals that while the cellular “alarm systems” are conserved, the specific pathways engaged are fine-tuned to the nature of the threat. Across multiple phenotypes—astronauts, scuba divers, alcohol consumers, and long-haul flight passengers—we observe consistent upregulation of genes and proteins related to inflammation [ 1 3 4 5 20 21 24 27 28 45 73 1 3 7 20 21 22 23 24 28 32 33 45 50 66 70 72 74 75 6 26 40 41 64 66 Comparing the molecular triggers and downstream cascades reveal important parts of this mechanism. For instance, the stress response in astronauts is heavily influenced by space radiation, which induces DNA double-strand breaks and activates the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, with key roles for signaling molecules like ATM and p53. In contrast, the primary stressor for a scuba diver is often hyperoxia, which generates a surge of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This predominantly activates antioxidant defense pathways, such as the Nrf2 signaling cascade, leading to the upregulation of enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase to neutralize oxidative damage. While both scenarios may result in a general inflammatory state, often mediated by the NF-κB pathway, the initial triggers are fundamentally different. Similarly, while the upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is a common feature indicating cellular stress [ 78 1 3 4 79 80 Extreme activities frequently necessitate significant shifts in energy metabolism. We see evidence of metabolic reprogramming across multiple phenotypes, particularly those involving intense physical exertion. Both bodybuilders and marathon runners demonstrate substantial alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism [ 81 82 83 84 82 85 86 However, the nature of the stressor dictates unique metabolic signatures. In the microgravity environment of spaceflight, for instance, omics data has shown an upregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism, including fatty acid biosynthesis, yet a concurrent downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and insulin signaling pathways in muscle tissue, potentially contributing to the documented development of insulin resistance. In contrast, the hyperbaric and hyperoxic stress of SCUBA diving triggers a different adaptive response. Metagenomic analysis of divers’ oral microbiota reveals a distinct shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolic pathways to capitalize on increased oxygen availability, while proteomic studies suggest an upregulation of endogenous antioxidant systems to counteract oxidative stress. These divergent strategies; anabolic redirection in bodybuilders, lipid dysregulation in astronauts, and oxidative adaptation in divers; highlight how different extreme conditions co-opt and modulate core metabolic networks. A deeper comparative analysis of these metabolic adaptations could reveal common strategies for optimizing energy production and utilization under extreme conditions. Exploring the interplay between these metabolic shifts and the gut microbiome, which also undergoes significant changes in several phenotypes, is another promising avenue for future research. The disruption of circadian rhythms and sleep patterns is another common challenge in many extreme activities, including spaceflight and long-haul air travel. However, while the core issue is shared, the nature and magnitude of the molecular dysregulation differ significantly based on the stressor. Both scenarios disrupt the body’s central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), leading to a stark reduction in the number of rhythmic transcripts that govern physiological homeostasis. Core targets here include clock genes like CLOCK and ARNTL (BMAL1) as well as the machinery for transcription and translation. The primary distinction lies in the severity and chronicity of the disruption. Long-haul flights induce an acute misalignment, where the extent of pathway dysregulation is generally proportional to the number of time zones crossed, with the body eventually re-entraining to the new light-dark cycle. In contrast, the spaceflight environment presents a more profound and continuous challenge. Astronauts in low Earth orbit experience a sunrise and sunset approximately every 90 min, which can desynchronize circadian rhythms between different tissues. Studies in animal models have revealed that spaceflight can alter the rhythmic amplitude of core clock genes like PER2 in peripheral organs such as the liver, independent of the central clock in the SCN. This suggests that while long-haul travel causes a systemic phase shift, spaceflight may induce a more chaotic, internal desynchrony among organ systems. Further investigation into the transcriptomic changes in pathways governing glucocorticoid signaling and metabolic function across these phenotypes could provide valuable insights into the shared and unique effects of these stressors on circadian regulation. 4. Integrating Insights for Translational Applications and Spaceflight The comparative analysis of extreme phenotypes provides a unique opportunity to leverage knowledge from one area to inform research, countermeasures, and interventions in another. For example, the insights gained from studying muscle wasting in astronauts could potentially be applied to developing interventions for sarcopenia, an age-related decline in muscle mass and function. Similarly, the research on circadian rhythm disruption in long-haul flight passengers and shift workers could inform the development of countermeasures for astronauts experiencing sleep disturbances in space. Specifically, regarding extended spaceflight, integrating knowledge gained from these diverse phenotypes offers three crucial advantages: (1) Shared Stress Adaptation Mechanisms (2) Personalized Risk Stratification and Countermeasures (3) Longitudinal Models for Health Risk Prediction 5. Future Directions for Integrated Research Developing standardized protocols and data analysis pipelines to facilitate the integration of multi-omics data across different extreme phenotypes is crucial. This will require collaborative efforts to harmonize data formats, ontologies, and analysis methods. Additionally, novel sample collection processes, leveraging strategies such as blood microsampling, during extreme activities should be explored, to obtain specimens that can generate multi-omics data reflective of biological changes during the activity. Understanding the sex differences in responses to extreme environments and activities is also crucial, and still emerging across all these fields. Applying systems biology approaches and computational modeling can help us decipher the complex interplay between different molecular layers and pathways involved in adaptation to extreme environments. This could lead to the identification of key regulatory networks and potential therapeutic targets. Understanding these molecular signatures will allow us to uncover principles of resilience applicable not only to astronauts and athletes, but also to aging and chronic diseases. Rigorous validation of potential biomarkers identified through omics analyses is essential for translating these findings into clinical practice. This will require large-scale, longitudinal studies and the development of robust assays for measuring these biomarkers. As omics technologies become more powerful and personalized, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of using this information, especially in the context of extreme activities with a limited number of participants. Protecting individual privacy, ensuring equitable access to interventions, and mitigating potential risks of genetic discrimination are important considerations. At the same time, promoting open science policies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration are essential for handling data from extreme environments, as these datasets are often unique to specific conditions and missions and are not easily reproducible. By pursuing these future directions, we can harness the power of multi-omics profiling and cross-phenotype analysis to unlock deeper insights into human adaptability and resilience, paving the way for safer and more successful human exploration of extreme environments, from the depths of the ocean to the vastness of space. 6. Conclusions Multi-omics profiling provides a powerful lens for investigating human adaptation to extreme environments. By integrating data across diverse phenotypes, we have highlighted common adaptive mechanisms, including alterations in immune function, DNA damage response, heat shock, and metabolic pathways. Phenotype-specific adaptations have also been revealed, highlighting the unique challenges posed by different extreme activities. This integrated approach holds immense promise for developing personalized strategies to mitigate risks, enhance resilience, and optimize human performance in harsh conditions. As we continue to push the boundaries of human exploration, a deeper understanding of these adaptive mechanisms will be essential for ensuring the health and safety of individuals venturing into extreme environments, particularly during extended spaceflight missions.

Phenotype Key Stressors Genomic/Epigenetic Findings Transcriptomic Findings Proteomic Metagenomic Findings Key Phenotype-Specific Astronauts Microgravity, radiation, confinement, altered day/night cycle, psychological stress. Telomere elongation, DNA damage responses, alterations in genes related to immune function and cytokine shifts. Cell-free RNA (cfRNA) profiles show systemic physiological shifts; direct RNA sequencing reveals m6A modifications linked to radiation/telomere response. Upregulation of pathways for immune function, bone metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Shifts in both gut and skin microbiome composition due to altered diet, stress, and confinement. Telomere elongation in response to spaceflight; development of Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS). Scuba Hyperbaric pressure, altered respiratory gas mixtures, cold temperatures, physical exertion. Not widely studied, but some variants are linked to cold water tolerance in specific populations (e.g., Haenyeo divers). Persistent upregulation of genes for inflammation, apoptosis, and innate immunity. Acute changes affecting T cells, NK cells, and neutrophils. Transient increases in markers for cardiac/muscle damage (NT-proBNP, CK-MB) and inflammation (CRP, IL-6). Upregulation of complement system proteins. Reduced diversity and shifts in the oral microbiota, with an increase in aerobic metabolic pathways. Upregulation of the complement system in response to hyperbaric stress is a notable adaptation. Long-Haul Airplane Passengers Prolonged immobility, low humidity, cabin hypoxia, circadian rhythm disruption (jet lag), pressure changes. Limited studies; potential for increased DNA damage and elevated stress-related mRNA levels (SERT, p11) noted in airline pilots. Largely unexplored but can be mapped against known human disease atlases. Largely unexplored; some evidence in pilots suggests effects on plasma neurotrophin levels. No direct studies available; dysbiosis is hypothesized due to environmental and circadian factors. Increased risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility and a hypoxic, pro-coagulant state. Bodybuilders Rigorous resistance training, cyclical high-protein and calorie-restricted diets (bulking/cutting). Genetic variability in genes regulating muscle growth and mass, such as MSTN (myostatin). Distinct gene expression patterns in skeletal muscle related to training status and response to exercise; specific microRNAs regulate muscle adaptation. Alterations in proteins related to mitochondrial metabolism, calcium signaling, and nutrient metabolism; distinct blood metabolite profiles. Unique gut microbial compositions, characterized by a reduced abundance of short-chain fatty acid producers. Extreme muscle hypertrophy driven by the interplay of resistance training and nutrition; gut microbiome shifts potentially related to high-protein diets. Simulation Racers Prolonged and intense mental concentration, localized muscle fatigue, potential repetitive strain injuries. No known multi-omics studies have been conducted. This represents a significant research gap. No known multi-omics studies have been conducted. No known multi-omics studies have been conducted. No known multi-omics studies have been conducted. Neurological adaptations including enhanced perceptual speed, motor skills, and greater neural efficiency in motor control areas. Acute Alcohol Consumers Systemic toxicity from alcohol and its metabolites (e.g., acetaldehyde). Genetic variants in alcohol metabolism genes (ADH, ALDH) influence response; epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation) affect gene expression. Altered gene expression in the brain (neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity) and liver (lipid metabolism, inflammation). Alterations in proteins involved in detoxification, lipid metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and oxidative stress response. Gut microbiome dysbiosis, characterized by changes in bacterial diversity and increased intestinal permeability. Distinct molecular damage signatures concentrated in the liver and brain, related to detoxification pathways, neurotoxicity, and inflammation. ",
