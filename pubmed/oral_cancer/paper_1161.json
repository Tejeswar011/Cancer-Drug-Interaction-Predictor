Introduction Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila Animals with different bodies and brains have evolved highly diverse and sophisticated behaviour profiles to feed. This is especially evident in insects, which are one of the most diverse groups of animals and have long been used as non-mammalian animal models for feeding research [ 1 Apart from their role as valuable models for understanding the genetic, molecular, and neuronal mechanisms of feeding, as many of these aspects have been conserved between insects and mammals, understanding insect feeding has more direct and profound medical, ecological, and economic implications. In this review, we briefly discuss Drosophila Drosophila 2. Feeding Research in Drosophila 2.1. The Feeding Apparatus The entire feeding process of the fly has been proposed to consist of 11 steps divided into four main categories—food search, feeding initiation, food ingestion, and feeding cessation [ 2 Briefly, the food-seeking process is initiated in the fly through vision and olfaction cues. The olfactory sensilla in the antenna and maxillary palps provide long-range and short-range olfaction, respectively [ 3 Figure 1 4 5 5 Several steps of this entire process can serve as checkpoints for regulating feeding under the influence of internal states, hunger, and satiety, which have been studied in great detail [ 6 7 8 9 2.2. Drosophila Feeding Assays Decades of prandiology research in flies have gone hand in hand with developing new and improved techniques for detecting and quantifying feeding in small flies that consume minuscule amounts of food. The assays can be divided into direct and indirect food intake measurements. Direct food intake measurement uses labelled or liquid food ( Figure 2 10 11 12 Figure 2 13 Ease of measurement of liquid food intake has been taken advantage of, as many assays were developed to measure liquid food intake ( Figure 2 14 15 16 17 18 19 Attempts are being made to increase the throughput of these simple assays. The Whole Animal Feeding Flat (WAFFL) and Microplate Feeder Assay [ 20 Figure 2 Another recently developed assay called Direct Intake Estimation and Tracking of Solid food consumption (DIETS) relies on accurate weighing of solid food in specially designed food vials that can be used to study feeding of special diets such as high-fat or high-sugar diets, dietary-restricted feeding or time-restricted feeding, and are even suited for longitudinal studies to study feeding over days or weeks [ 21 Indirect food intake assays estimate the intake from events associated with feedings, such as proboscis extension [ 22 23 24 Figure 2 With the advancement of automated techniques, several high throughput assays have been developed based on electrical measurements. These methods are basically proboscis extension assays and rely on indirect measurement by changes in electrical properties upon food contact. They offer several advantages like assaying freely moving flies, much higher temporal and spatial resolution, and measurement of multiple parameters of a feeding event. The Fly Proboscis and Activity Detector (FlyPad) is a capacitance-based assay [ 12 Figure 2 25 26 Voltage-based assays include the Fly Liquid-food Interaction Counter (FLIC) [ 27 28 Figure 2 While there is no single reliable method for measuring all aspects of feeding, each method has its advantages suited for studying a specific feature. Hence, a combination of different assays can be used to quantify and study a multitude of behavioural parameters with wide-ranging applications ( Figure 3 The field is rapidly evolving, with new methods continuously being developed to increase the throughput and allow for high-resolution studies. As a result, researchers can now study this behaviour with unprecedented detail. 3. Drosophila 3.1. Human Eating Behaviour Dysregulation Feeding is governed by complex integrated circuitry and signals involving the motivational and sensory components. Motivational circuits process and monitor metabolic energy status and generate hunger signals at low energy levels that promote animal feeding. The motivation to feed can be broadly classified as a metabolic or a hedonistic drive. [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Integration of sensory information from the internal drive, need to feed, food external characteristics, and food availability plays a critical role in animal feeding. Problems in the integration of sensory information may lead to dysregulation of the homeostatic mechanism, resulting in metabolic disorders of energy balance and psychological eating disorders. Humans are increasingly suffering from eating disorders—overeating and undereating. While overeating-related problems like obesity and being overweight are major risk factors for most modern diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer [ 37 38 39 40 41 In this section, we briefly discuss how Drosophila 3.1.1. Fly Feeding Research and Energy Homeostasis/Metabolic Disorders Metabolic syndrome is an increasingly common health burden defined as having more than three from a cluster of diseases that center around abnormal insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. It is primarily characterized by dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, obesity, and elevated fasting glucose levels. While vertebrate model systems have been extensively employed to uncover therapeutic strategies for this complex disorder, the invertebrate Drosophila 42 Drosophila 43 44 45 Similar to humans, excess calorie intake leads to obesity in Drosophila 46 47 Drosophila 47 47 48 47 gbb 49 dFOXO spargel Drosophila PGC1α 50 51 Similarly, feeding a high-sugar diet (HSD) to larval or adult Drosophila Drosophila 46 52 53 Drosophila 54 55 Since key characteristics of human obesity and diabetes have been effectively replicated in Drosophila 56 Hedgehog 56 Drosophila ABCG1 57 Drosophila Complementary to the existing Drosophila 58 Dietary exposure of flies to novel and promising therapeutic agents has been tested for their usefulness in treating metabolic conditions; for example, a plant compound, cucurbitacin, was shown to suppress hyperglycaemia associated with HSD in Drosophila 59 60 Drosophila 61 62 3.1.2. Fly Feeding Research and Psychological Eating Disorders Eating disorders have a negative impact on well-being, mood, neurodevelopment, and quality of life [ 63 64 65 The immense complexity of the neural circuitry involved in these mental health disorders has frustrated efforts to develop targeted therapies [ 66 67 Drosophila 68 Drosophila Drosophila A considerable amount of research has been conducted using Drosophila 69 70 71 Drosophila 72 73 74 Drosophila Apart from circuitry, Drosophila To highlight this potential, we looked for orthology between human genes associated with eating disorders and their Drosophila Table 1 Drosophila melanogaster Supplementary Table S1 Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila The table outlining genes related to human eating disorders and their orthologous counterparts in Drosophila Drosophila Drosophila Drosophila 3.1.3. Limitation of Drosophila as a Model for Human Eating Dysregulation While Drosophila melanogaster 3.2. Infectious Diseases and Medical Pests Owing to the powerful and versatile genetic tools available, Drosophila 125 126 Drosophila 127 128 129 130 131 Besides being an insect model for human diseases, the strength of Drosophila 132 Figure 4 For humans and livestock, insects are more than mere irritants and nuisance. From deadly direct effects like envenomation, dermatitis, and myiasis, to being vectors for the indirect transmission of diseases of epidemic and pandemic proportions, medical pests have a tremendous impact on human and animal health [ 133 134 Drosophila Plasmodium gallinaceum Plasmodium 135 Plasmodium Drosophila 136 Drosophila 137 Drosophila Plasmodium 138 139 Arthropod-borne viruses, referred to as arboviruses, that cause dengue and yellow fever have long been associated with humans. Recently, there have been major outbreaks of newer viruses like Zika, Chikungunya, West Nile, and other emerging, more abstruse ones [ 140 Drosophila 141 Wolbachia 142 143 In addition to this, Drosophila 144 145 3.2.1. Elucidating the Feeding Behaviour of Hematophagous Insects Hematophagy is the blood-feeding behaviour characteristic of some invertebrates like mosquitoes, sandflies, blackflies, blowflies, lice, midges, bedbugs, fleas, ticks, etc., that act as ectoparasites and feed on vertebrate blood while being in either temporary, periodic, or permanent contact with the host. They target a wide range of vertebrate host species, providing an opportunity for the transfer of numerous disease pathogens. In a world increasingly affected by climate change, land-use modifications, and extensive human and goods transportation, several major vector-borne diseases are emerging or re-emerging and continuing to spread [ 146 This blood feeding is a highly intricate process guided by specialized sensory system for locating their hosts and drawing their blood [ 147 Anopheles gambiae Aedes aegypti 144 145 Even though hematophagy and the apparatus necessary for it is non-existent in Drosophila Drosophila 132 A. gambiae Drosophila 148 149 150 151 152 153 Drosophila 154 151 155 Drosophila Anopheles gambiae 156 Drosophila Aedes aegypti 157 Drosophila A wide variety of approaches are used for the study of mosquito blood-feeding habits, which involve complex collection methods that may involve live host baits and different blood meal identification techniques that have their own limitations [ 158 Drosophila A. aedis 159 Apart from mosquitos, several other hematophagous insects are responsible for vectoring serious diseases, such as triatomine bugs (subfamily: Reduviidae Trypanosoma cruzi 160 Trypanosoma Glossina Drosophila 161 Leishmania A common theme through all these vector diseases is the idea that blood-feeding has an important role in vector–pathogen interactions and multiple sequential blood meals influence the dynamics of the virus or parasitic pathogens they carry and, hence, their dissemination [ 162 Drosophila 3.2.2. Development of Insect Repellent and Control Agents Despite decades of control efforts, mosquito-transmitted diseases continue to be a major worldwide public health issue. Insecticide-based vector control programs and insect repellents are commonly used; however, there are many gaps and a need for complementary tools. Insecticide resistance is a compounding factor in the control of malarial vectors, contributing to many failed programs. Drosophila 163 Prophylactic insect repellents such as N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) have been around for decades. It was in Drosophila 164 Drosophila 165 166 167 168 Botanically sourced insect repellents like citronellal have been gaining popularity and have also been studied in Drosophila 169 170 Insect pests detect their food source and the unsuspecting hosts to the pathogens they carry through a variety of sensory system like sight, odour, heat, or moisture perception. Of these, the olfactory system is the prime mediator in vector–host interactions, as the cocktail of volatile chemicals emanating from the host is detected before any of the other cues [ 171 2 Drosophila 172 173 Delineating taste circuits in Drosophila Drosophila Drosophila 174 Biological control of vector insects is also an important and active area of research to tackle the problem [ 175 Toxornychites 176 Aedes 177 Drosophila 4. Drosophila 4.1. Economic Loss Caused by Agricultural Pests The growing global population increasingly pressures agricultural productivity, which is further exacerbated by plant pathogens and pests that lead to reduced yields, thus posing significant threats to crop productivity and food security. The diverse agricultural insects and their effects on crop plants range from a crucial role as pollinators indispensable for agriculture to pests that wreak havoc on food production. Various insects are considered pests due to the harm they cause such as the direct damage from feeding on plants (Western corn rootworm, Colorado potato beetle, phylloxera, locusts, etc.), indirect damage by vectoring plant viruses (aphids, whiteflies, planthoppers), and damage by infestation on stored products (e.g., beetles, moths, weevils, etc.). Insects that feed on plant sap lead to extensive crop damage due to sap depletion, soiling of leaves, toxins in saliva, and even as vectors of plant viruses [ 178 179 According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), 20–40% of global agricultural crops are lost annually to insect pests amounting to about USD 70 billion. For instance, the oriental fruit fly ( Bactrocera dorsalis Despite the significant impact of plant pests, there is a scarcity of resources, techniques, and methods to effectively address this problem. While numerous methods exist for detecting fungi and bacterial plant pathogens, there are limited methods for detecting and preventing insect pests. Drosophila melanogaster 4.2. Drosophila as a Model for Pest Behaviour and Feeding Regulation Our protagonist fly itself is an agricultural pest of sorts in its natural habitat. D. melanogaster D. suzukii 180 D. suzukii 181 182 183 Drosophila 184 Helicoverpa armigera 185 Spodoptera litura 186 187 Drosophila 188 189 190 191 74 192 One of the emerging eco-friendly technologies is photodynamic inactivation (PDI), which involves feeding or exposing microbial and insect pests with photosensitizer compounds, which, when exposed to light, can produce highly reactive oxygen species that are lethal to insects. This technology has been established and tested well for its anti-microbial action; however, studies evaluating PDI for insect pests are scarce. A recent study standardized two assays—spray assay and feed assay—to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) using sodium magnesium chlorophyllin as a photosensitizer. The results demonstrate significant moribundity rates in Drosophila Drosophila 193 Additionally, Drosophila melanogaster 194 195 195 4.3. Drosophila as a Model for Beneficial Insects and Pollinator Protection A huge number of arthropods are classified as beneficial insects, which provide the desired outcome from a human perspective with their multitude of ecosystem services. Beneficial insects include those that are cultivated for their products and by-products (such as honey, beeswax lac, resins, silk, ink, and dye pigments) and those valued for their pollination services (e.g., bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, ants, and flower beetles) or utility in modern agriculture and horticulture as parasitoids (mainly ichneumonid and chalcid wasps) and predators (ladybugs, hoverflies, lacewings) for pest control. From an agronomical standpoint, insects affect crop production in many ways, including soil aeration and texture improvement and decomposing soil organic matter to improve nutrient profile [ 196 197 With the ever-increasing demands on the food production industry and the indiscriminate use of pesticides, there has been a widespread decline in pollinator insects [ 198 199 200 Apis millifera Drosophila 201 202 203 Drosophila 204 205 RNA interference technology has been explored to protect plants from pests and beneficial insects from viral diseases. However, in the mechanisms of RNAi delivery, uptake and downstream effect vary by tissue and developmental stage. Since RNAi often requires ingestion of double-stranded RNA molecules, Drosophila 206 Drosophila The agricultural field is an artificial ecosystem with highly fateful insect–plant interactions. It is critical to maintain a fine balance of the friend and the foe ( Figure 5 4.4. Limitations and Future Perspectives The strength of Drosophila Drosophila Drosophila Drosophila 5.
