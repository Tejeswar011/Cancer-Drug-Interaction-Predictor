Its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antimelanogenic properties support its use; however, its poor aqueous solubility and limited skin permeability constrain its optimal topical delivery. This review summarizes clinical evidence and advances in formulations—including conventional vehicles, polymeric/lipid nanocarriers, and deep eutectic solvent (DES) systems—to promote more effective and well-tolerated use. Across indications, 15–20% azelaic acid (AzA) formulations produced clinically meaningful improvements with mild, transient local irritation. For acne vulgaris, reductions in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions were comparable to those of topical retinoids/adapalene, and tolerability was superior in some studies. For rosacea, the 15% gel formulation was comparable to metronidazole in reducing papules, pustules, and erythema while maintaining negligible systemic exposure. In melasma and other dyschromias, 20% cream demonstrated efficacy similar to hydroquinone, exhibiting a favorable safety profile. Advanced delivery systems, including liposomes, niosomes/ethosomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, microemulsions, nanosponges, and DES platforms, increased AzA solubilization, cutaneous deposition, and stability. This enabled dose-sparing strategies and improved adherence. Data on AzA cocrystals and ionic salts suggest additional control over release and irritation. AzA remains a versatile and well-tolerated dermatologic agent whose performance is strongly vehicle-dependent. Rational selection and engineering of carriers, particularly DES-integrated polymeric and lipid systems, can mitigate solubility and permeability limitations, enhance skin targeting, and reduce irritation in the treatment of acne and rosacea. azelaic acid topical drug delivery nanocarriers liposomes solid lipid nanoparticles nanocrystals microemulsions deep eutectic solvents controlled release formulation development Romanian Ministry of Education and Research, CCCDI-UEFISCDI PN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2020-2177 PNCDI III PCE 157/2021 This study was supported by a grant from the Romanian Ministry of Education and Research, CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2020-2177, within PNCDI III, contract number PCE 157/2021. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction 1.1. Structure, Physicochemical Properties, and Natural Occurrence of Azelaic Acid Azelaic acid (AzA) is a saturated dicarboxylic acid with the molecular formula C 9 16 4 1 2 Figure 1 2 2 Physically, it is a white, odorless crystalline powder with a melting point between 106.5 °C to 109 °C. It is sparingly soluble in water (~2.4 g/L at 20 °C) but highly soluble in ethanol and other polar solvents—important for topical formulation [ 2 It has two dissociation constants (pKa 4.55 and 5.50), reflecting the deprotonation of its COOH groups. Its log P is ~1.22, indicating moderate lipophilicity that aids skin permeation [ 2 AzA occurs naturally in grains such as barley and rye, and is a metabolic byproduct of Malassezia furfur 3 4 5 6 Jathropa curcas Triticum durum w v ® 7 AzA is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). FDA Orange Book of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations shows a consistent list of commercially approved products formulated as aerosols, foams, cream, and gel, respectively, with seven dossier applicant holders reporting AzA concentration of 15% and 20% [ 8 9 1.2. Synthesis and Industrial Production: Sustainable and Conventional Routes for Azelaic Acid Production In addition to its natural occurrence, AzA can be synthesized through various industrial and biocatalytic pathways (summarized in Table 1 To address these limitations, several greener and more sustainable methods have been developed. An industrial-scale process implemented by Matrica S.p.A. (a joint venture between Versalis and Novamont) in Porto Torres (Italy) utilizes hydrogen peroxide to oxidize vegetable oil-derived oleic acid, achieving production capacities of 25,000–30,000 tons/year [ 10 A convergent synthesis and process for the open-chain C-9 compounds, valuable monomers for preparation of polyamides with specific properties, has also been reported [ 13 14 11 Biocatalytic routes employ enzymes such as lipases for the epoxidation of oleic acid, followed by oxidative cleavage with H 2 2 3 3 12 Since the 1970s, research has highlighted its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-keratinizing actions, leading to its approval as a topical agent [ 15 Clinically, AzA is used to treat acne vulgaris, rosacea, melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Randomized controlled trials have validated its effectiveness—particularly the 20% cream and 15% gel formulations—showing reductions in inflammatory lesions and erythema, with good tolerability in sensitive skin [ 16 17 18 19 17 18 However, formulation remains a challenge due to low water solubility and moderate lipophilicity of AzA, which limits its topical bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, new delivery systems—including liposomes, nanocarriers, and deep eutectic solvents (DESs)—have been developed to improve skin penetration, drug stability, and patient compliance [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 1.3. Global Approvals, Usage Patterns, and Market Trends for Azelaic Acid Products Its global regulatory status underscores its clinical relevance. In the US, the FDA has approved 15% gel for rosacea and 20% cream for acne. In Europe, those formulations are approved in multiple countries. While melasma treatment is off-label in Europe, it is widely used based on supporting evidence [ 25 26 27 In Romania, AzA is available in both cream (20%) and gel (15%) formulations, officially registered in the Romanian national medicines database. These topical treatments are indicated for acne vulgaris and rosacea and are dispensed as prescription-only medications. The 15% gel formulation is particularly used for papulopustular rosacea, and its presence is confirmed in the national regulatory authority’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). AzA’s recognized efficacy and tolerability, especially in individuals with sensitive skin, support its use in mild to moderate inflammatory skin conditions [ 28 The global market for azelaic acid-based dermatological products has shown steady growth, driven by increasing demand for effective acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation therapies. According to Market.us and Allied Market Research, the market was valued at over USD 200 million in 2023 and is projected to exceed USD 415 million by 2033, growing at a CAGR of approximately 7%. This growth is supported by strong market penetration across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, with Europe showing notable demand driven by cosmetic and pharmaceutical sectors. AzA’s dual availability as both a prescription medication and an over-the-counter (OTC) ingredient has further facilitated its widespread clinical adoption. Though specific regulatory approvals vary by region ( Figure 2 29 30 31 Initially, formulations relied on simple creams and gels with propylene glycol or alcohol, but these often-caused irritation or dryness [ 16 32 33 19 24 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 In conclusion, AzA is a multifunctional dermatological agent with proven safety, tolerability, and efficacy across acne, rosacea, and pigmentation disorders. Despite solubility challenges, innovations in formulation science—particularly with DESs and nanocarriers—are unlocking new therapeutic opportunities for this established compound. 2. Pharmacodynamics and Mechanisms of Action: Biological Activities of Azelaic Acid and Their Therapeutic Relevance AzA exhibits a diverse array of biological activities that underpin its well-established therapeutic applications in dermatology. These include antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antimelanogenic, and antioxidant mechanisms, each mediated by distinct molecular targets and pathways. An overview of these actions is presented in Table 2 These diverse mechanisms ( Figure 3 5 43 3 4 Antibacterial Mechanism and Other Medical Indications The antibacterial activity of AzA is well-documented, particularly against Cutibacterium acnes Propionibacterium acnes 3 4 34 49 In vitro studies have demonstrated that AzA exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram-positive skin flora, including Cutibacterium acnes Staphylococcus epidermidis 34 50 34 3 Additionally, AzA exhibits bacteriostatic activity rather than bactericidal effects at therapeutic concentrations, inhibiting the proliferation of Cutibacterium acnes 3 51 Recent research indicates that AzA may also inhibit biofilm formation by C. acnes 52 53 52 54 Furthermore, the antibacterial efficacy of AzA is influenced by environmental pH, with enhanced activity observed under mildly acidic conditions that reflect the microenvironment of acne-affected skin [ 3 Another mechanistic layer involves AzA’s ability to induce intracellular acidification within bacterial cells by facilitating proton influx, disrupting the proton gradient necessary for bacterial energy metabolism and homeostasis [ 3 While AzA shows strong activity against Gram-positive bacteria, its antimicrobial spectrum does not extend effectively to Gram-negative species, highlighting its selective antibacterial profile [ 3 55 AzA’s anti-inflammatory activity is mediated through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are key drivers of inflammation in acne and rosacea pathophysiology. By inhibiting their expression, AzA reduces leukocyte recruitment and inflammatory cascade activation within the dermis [ 43 56 In vitro studies using cultured keratinocytes have shown that AzA suppresses nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, a transcription factor that regulates inflammatory gene expression, thereby limiting the transcription of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules and attenuating local inflammatory responses [ 43 Furthermore, AzA exhibits antioxidant effects that help reduce oxidative stress in inflamed skin, a mechanism partly attributed to its suppression of pro-oxidative mediators and inflammatory signaling pathways [ 43 57 43 56 Clinical studies corroborate these mechanistic findings, demonstrating significant reductions in erythema and papule counts in rosacea patients treated with a gel containing 15% AzA, while maintaining a favorable safety profile for long-term use without systemic immunosuppression [ 56 Additionally, AzA may modulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling during inflammation; preliminary studies suggest downregulation of MMP-9 activity, potentially reducing tissue degradation and inflammatory damage [ 57 Beyond these actions, AzA has been shown to inhibit the activity of kallikrein 5 and the expression of cathelicidin (LL-37), key contributors to the inflammatory response in rosacea, thereby mitigating inflammatory cascades specific to this condition [ 43 56 43 56 AzA exerts a potent antimelanogenic effect by targeting melanogenesis at the enzymatic level. Its primary mechanism involves competitive inhibition of tyrosinase, a copper-containing enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and ultimately to melanin [ 58 59 60 58 59 60 In vitro enzyme kinetics studies have demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of tyrosinase activity by AzA, with reported IC 50 59 60 61 62 58 59 Additionally, AzA selectively inhibits hyperactive melanocyte proliferation and DNA synthesis without significantly affecting normal melanocytes [ 58 63 58 63 Histological analyses of hyperpigmented skin treated with AzA demonstrate a reduction in melanocyte activity and melanin granule deposition in the basal epidermis [ 58 63 58 63 Notably, AzA’s antimelanogenic effect is effective as monotherapy and does not require corticosteroid or tretinoin co-administration [ 58 63 AzA is increasingly acknowledged for its antioxidant role alongside its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects [ 4 42 64 42 64 Evidence from in vitro and clinical research demonstrates that AzA lowers oxidative stress markers and protects skin cells from lipid peroxidation and oxidative injury, thereby supporting skin barrier integrity [ 4 64 Moreover, its ROS-scavenging capacity is believed to complement endogenous antioxidant systems, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase, although direct upregulation by AzA requires further confirmation [ 4 42 The antioxidant properties of AzA contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in inflammatory skin conditions like acne and rosacea, by reducing oxidative tissue damage and preventing melanocyte stimulation that leads to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation [ 42 64 4 The main pharmacological targets and mechanisms of AzA in dermatological applications are summarized in Table 3 3. Clinical Studies 3.1. Clinical Trials and Outcomes in Acne Vulgaris AzA has been extensively evaluated in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of acne vulgaris due to its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-keratinizing properties. Thielitz et al. [ 17 Similarly, Katsambas et al. [ 67 In another randomized clinical trial, Iraji et al. [ 68 3.2. Rosacea: Evidence-Based Efficacy AzA has been extensively studied as a topical treatment for inflammatory skin conditions such as papulopustular rosacea, owing to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties targeting Cutibacterium acnes 69 A pivotal randomized, double-blind trial by Thiboutot et al. [ 70 p Further evidence from Elewski et al. [ 15 p p p A comprehensive review by Frampton and Wagstaff summarized the results of three pivotal randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trials evaluating AzA 15% gel for papulopustular rosacea. In two vehicle-controlled trials ( n n p p p p p p 71 Clinical trials consistently demonstrate that AzA 15% gel provides significant reductions in inflammatory lesions and erythema in papulopustular rosacea, with efficacy comparable to or exceeding that of metronidazole 0.75% gel, and with favorable tolerability and cosmetic outcomes reported across multiple randomized controlled trials. 3.3. Hyperpigmentation Disorders: Monotherapy and Combination Regimens Clinical Trials in Hyperpigmentation Disorders A randomized, double-masked, multicenter trial evaluated AzA 20% cream versus vehicle in patients with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes IV to VI presenting facial hyperpigmentation. Over a 24-week period, AzA produced significantly greater reductions in pigmentary intensity than vehicle, as measured by both an investigator-rated scale ( p p p p p 72 Extensive clinical research has established AzA as a safe and effective agent for treating various pigmentary disorders, particularly melasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Its therapeutic utility in dermatology is supported by several well-structured clinical trials assessing its role both as monotherapy and in combination regimens. More directly focused on hyperpigmentation, a randomized, double-masked, multicenter study evaluated AzA 20% cream in darker-skinned individuals (Fitzpatrick phototypes IV to VI) with facial hyperpigmentation. Over a 24-week period, AzA significantly reduced pigmentary intensity compared to vehicle, as measured by both the investigator’s subjective scale ( p p p 72 A comparative open-label trial in Pakistan assessed the efficacy of AzA 20% cream alone versus its combination with tretinoin 0.1% cream in 48 patients with melasma. After six months of treatment, 79% of patients in the combination group showed excellent or good improvement, compared to 71% in the monotherapy group; both results were statistically significant ( p 73 Collectively, these clinical trials underscore AzA’s robust efficacy and favorable safety profile in the treatment of hyperpigmentation disorders. Its versatility, whether used alone or in synergistic combinations with agents like glycolic acid or tretinoin, makes it particularly suitable for diverse patient populations, including those with darker skin tones who are often more prone to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. As a non-hydroquinone alternative, AzA remains a cornerstone in pigmentary disorder management. 3.4. Safety and Tolerability Profile AzA is generally well tolerated; though, clinical trials and dermal safety studies have consistently reported mild to moderate local adverse effects. The most common include burning, stinging, pruritus, erythema, dryness, and scaling, particularly during the initial weeks of therapy [ 1 71 74 Similarity, a 24-week study by Kakita et al. [ 75 In rosacea, comparative studies between AzA 15% gel and metronidazole 0.75% gel consistently demonstrated a favorable safety profile. While neurosensory symptoms such as stinging, tingling, and burning were reported slightly more often with AzA, they were usually transient and resolved within one to two weeks [ 18 76 Rare adverse effects, such as contact dermatitis, facial edema, and acne occur in fewer than 1% of patients and are typically mild and reversible upon discontinuation of treatment [ 1 71 Importantly, systemic side effects are exceedingly rare due to minimal percutaneous absorption [ 1 77 A randomized trial by Tehrani et al. [ 78 p 19 Table 4 4. Stability and Analytical Methods 4.1. Introduction and Analytical Challenges AzA presents notable analytical challenges due to its non-chromophore structure lacking strong UV-absorbing or fluorescent groups. As a result, accurate quantification in pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations often requires chemical derivatization to introduce detectable groups or improve volatility. However, most of these methods require chemical derivatization of AzA to introduce a chromophore or improve volatility-for example, pre-column tagging with fluorescent reagents (e.g., leucine–coumarinylamide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide) or silylation/methylation for GC analysis. While derivatization enhances sensitivity, it introduces significant limitations: time-consuming procedures, demand of advanced chemistry expertise, unsatisfactory chemical stability of derivatives (mono- or di-esters) that lead to peak broadening and poor reproducibility. These challenges have spurred the development of non-derivatized and stability-indicating analytical methods, which are now increasingly favored for AzA quantification in quality control and formulation development contexts [ 85 4.2. Stability Testing of Azelaic Acid Formulations Stability studies assess whether a formulation maintains its chemical potency and physical integrity under defined environmental conditions. ICH guidelines (e.g., Q1A/R2) recommend testing at controlled temperatures/humidities (e.g., long-term 25 °C, accelerated 40 °C) to simulate shelf-life. Acceptable stability is typically defined as retention of 90–110% of the initial drug content, without significant degradation or physical change. For example, an ethosome-based AzA cream stored over 12 weeks exhibits minimal degradation, maintaining drug content within regulatory limits alongside stable pH, viscosity, and physical appearance. Conversely, stress testing-exposing AzA to heat, light, oxidation, or pH extremes-often reveals degradation pathways. Notably, during accelerated testing of a liposomal AzA formulation, a previously unreported impurity was identified as ethyl azelate, likely formed through esterification between AzA and the ethanol excipient [ 86 4.3. Stability-Indicating Analytical Methods According to ICH Q2(R1), a stability-indicating method must specifically quantify the intact active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the presence of impurities, degradants, or excipients. Method development typically involves forced degradation of AzA, followed by validation of the method’s capacity to resolve and quantify the parent compound. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the method of choice. In one validated study, Malik et al. [ 85 4.4. Chromatographic Techniques for Azelaic Acid Analysis Reversed-phase HPLC remains the most widely used and validated approach for AzA. Historically, pre- or post-column derivatization was employed to enhance UV detection. However, recent methods capitalize on AzA’s weak absorbance at ~204–210 nm, using acidic mobile phases to enhance signal and enable direct detection. For example, a validated isocratic HPLC method using UV detection at 206 nm achieved a retention time of ~8 min and was linear over 5–400 μg/mL (r 2 85 Alternative detectors such as evaporative light scattering (ELSD) and charged aerosol detection (CAD) have also been employed to circumvent AzA’s weak UV absorbance. ELSD enabled impurity detection in liposomal formulations, while LC-MS/MS methods—operated in negative ion mode—offer superior selectivity and sensitivity (ng/mL range), particularly valuable for biological matrices or complex extracts [ 7 86 85 86 4.5. Spectrophotometric Assays for Azelaic Acid Despite AzA’s weak UV activity, direct UV spectrophotometry remains viable at low wavelengths (e.g., 204 nm), particularly for bulk materials or high-concentration dosage forms. One validated method using phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) demonstrated linearity in the 10–50 μg/mL range and recovery rates between 98 and 102%, with minimal excipient interference [ 87 Although colorimetric assays exploiting AzA’s reactivity remain unexplored, they represent a promising avenue for simplified field or low-resource settings in future research. 4.6. Method Validation and Performance Parameters All analytical methods for AzA must comply with ICH Q2(R1) validation guidelines, addressing: Specificity: ability to differentiate AzA from excipients and degradants. Linearity: typically validated over 2–3 orders of magnitude (e.g., 5–400 μg/mL). Accuracy and Precision: recovery of 97–100% and %RSD ≤ 2% in replicate tests. LOD/LOQ: for the UV-HPLC method at 206 nm, LOD was ~1.08 μg/mL and LOQ 3.28 μg/mL [ 85 Robustness: demonstrated stability under ±10% variations in pH, flow rate, and detection wavelength. 5. Formulation Strategies and Delivery Systems: From Conventional Vehicles to Advanced Nanocarriers Topical delivery of AzA is limited by its poor aqueous solubility (~2.4 mg/mL at 25 °C) [ 88 2 88 5.1. Conventional Formulations (Gels, Creams, Foams) AzA has been formulated into various conventional dosage forms, including gels [ 70 89 90 91 92 93 The earliest commercial formulation was a 20% AzA cream, approved in Europe for acne vulgaris and rosacea [ 94 This cream employs a hydrophilic base containing propylene glycol [ 94 95 96 97 Recent studies have explored semi-solid emulsions and oil-in-water creams with modified emulsifier systems to further optimize skin penetration while minimizing irritation [ 50 98 Overall, conventional formulations of AzA continue to evolve through modulation of excipients and delivery systems to improve patient adherence, reduce irritation, and enhance therapeutic outcomes. 5.2. Nanocarrier-Based Formulations Beyond conventional creams and gels, innovative nanocarrier systems have been developed to overcome AzA’s low aqueous solubility, limited skin penetration, and potential for local irritation. These advanced delivery systems enhance drug localization in the epidermis, promote sustained release, and minimal systemic exposure [ 99 100 101 102 103 37 5.2.1. Liposomes Liposomes ( Figure 4 24 104 A 2016 study by Burchacka et al. [ 24 2 2 24 In another study, Pasca et al. [ 100 Staphylococcus aureus Enterococcus faecalis 100 5.2.2. Ethosomes Ethosomes ( Figure 5 105 In a 2016 study, Mistry and Ravikumar developed an azelaic acid-loaded ethosomal formulation optimized for acne treatment. Using thin-film hydration (outperforming hot and cold methods), they formulated vesicles with soya phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and ethanol, with component ratios optimized via central composite design. The resulting ethosomal vesicles exhibited a mean size of 514.3 nm, a low polydispersity index (PDI = 0.08), and a zeta potential of −35.44 mV, indicating a stable and uniform dispersion. Entrapment efficiency reached 91.86 ± 2.25%, and the ethosomal gel exhibited a skin-compatible pH (5.6) and high drug content (98.2%). In vitro and ex vivo studies revealed sustained drug release over 12 h (89.6% and 93.4%, respectively), surpassing both a conventional gel and a marketed cream. The formulation followed zero-order release kinetics (R 2 2 105 In another study, Apriani et al. [ 34 w w 34 5.2.3. Niosomes Niosomes ( Figure 6 106 107 108 In a 2023 study, Kashyap and Rani developed a niosomal gel formulation of AzA for acne therapy using the thin-film hydration technique. Niosomes were prepared using various non-ionic surfactants (Span 20, 40, and 60) and cholesterol, with aloe vera incorporated to mitigate skin irritation. The optimized niosomal formulations were incorporated into a Carbopol 940 gel base containing 2% w w 102 5.2.4. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), presented in Figure 7 109 110 In a recent study, Nautiyal and Wairkar formulated azelaic-acid loaded SLNs using ethanol evaporation followed by high-pressure homogenization. The optimized formulation (M4) contained 20% stearic acid, 10% AzA, and Poloxamer 188 as the surfactant-selected based on solubility screening as the most compatible combination. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed nearly spherical particles with a mean diameter of 281–282 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of ~0.32, and zeta potential of −15 mV. Drug content was 97%, with an encapsulation efficiency of 76.6%. Franz-diffusion cell experiments demonstrated a 24–h cumulative drug release of 93.9% from the SLNs significantly outperforming the 67.0% release from a marketed 20% cream. Antioxidant capacity measured by DPPH assays showed 70.1% radical scavenging—comparable to the commercial product (86.9%). In B16F10 melanocyte assays, 10% SLNs inhibited melanin production (55.8%) and tyrosinase activity (28.3%) as effectively as the 20% cream, while maintaining higher cell viability (99% vs. 93.7%). Importantly, HET-CAM assays revealed no vascular irritation with the SLNs, unlike the reference cream, which caused slight hemorrhage and coagulation. Stability testing showed minimal particle size increase after 3 months at 5 °C (to 297 nm, ζ ≈ −15 mV), indicating good physical stability. However, storage at room temperature led to greater size growth (up to 392 nm). Overall, the results suggest that 10% azelaic-acid SLNs can achieve depigmenting efficacy comparable to a 20% commercial cream, while reducing cytotoxicity and irritation-offering a dose-sparing, safer alternative for the topical treatment of hyperpigmentation [ 35 5.2.5. Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) Nanostructured lipid carriers or NLCs ( Figure 8 111 112 113 In a comprehensive 2015 review, Naseri et al. [ 110 NLCs are typically produced via high-pressure homogenization (hot and cold), ultrasonication, solvent evaporation, and spray drying, with each offering specific advantages regarding particle size control, scalability, and thermal sensitivity. Compared to solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), NLCs exhibit greater encapsulation efficiency, enhanced colloidal stability, and more prolonged and consistent drug release profiles. Crucially, NLCs demonstrate high biocompatibility and skin affinity, mimicking the composition of stratum corneum lipids and enhancing cutaneous permeation without compromising barrier function. This makes them ideal carriers for lipophilic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) such as AzA, which typically suffer from poor aqueous solubility and limited skin retention. The review highlights the promise of NLC-based formulations in the treatment of acne and other dermatological conditions, noting their ability to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing irritation and systemic exposure [ 110 5.2.6. Nanosponges Nanosponges are nano-sized (approximately 250 nm to 1 μm), porous, three-dimensional particulate systems formed by cross-linking polymers—most often cyclodextrins—into a “sponge-like” matrix with internal cavities capable of encapsulating both hydrophobic and lipophilic molecules. These nanostructures offer several advantages: they improve drug solubility, provide protection from degradation, enable controlled release, and can modulate skin permeability, making them highly suitable for topical delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs like AzA [ 114 115 116 117 Kumar and Rao synthesized β-cyclodextrin nanosponges by melt-blending β cyclodextrin with diphenyl carbonate at 100 °C for 5 h, followed by freeze-drying AzA into the porous network. The 1:6 CD ratio yielded an optimal formulation (AANS 1:6), which enhanced aqueous solubility five-fold (9.28 µg/mL vs. 1.97 µg/mL for free AzA. The resulting particles were spherical, highly porous, and had a mean diameter of 228 nm, a low polydispersity index (PDI = 0.14), and a zeta potential of −21 mV. The encapsulation efficiency reached 88%, indicating strong drug-loading capability. In vitro release studies in pH 5.5 buffer showed controlled release without burst effect, with roughly approximately 66% of AzA released over 24 h. Cell viability assays in HaCaT keratinocytes showed a higher growth-inhibition rate for the nanosponge (54.9%) at 320 µg/mL compared to free drug (37.2%), but the slightly elevated IC 50 Antibacterial testing showed that the nanosponge formulation exhibited double the antimicrobial potency: MIC/MBC values against Staphylococcus aureus Cutibacterium acnes 50 37 5.2.7. Nanoemulsions Nanoemulsions ( Figure 9 118 119 120 In a 2019 study, Berlitz et al. [ 121 The final formulation had a mean droplet size of 419 nm, zeta potential−10.9 mV, pH 5.01, and encapsulation efficiency of 84.65%, remaining stable over 30 days. TEM confirmed spherical morphology, while FTIR verified successful drug entrapment. In vitro skin permeation studies using porcine skin revealed significantly higher AzA retention with the HA-loaded nanoemulsion (14.35%) versus the HA-free formulation (8.66%) and conventional emulsion (6.77%). Additionally, tyrosinase inhibition was greater (IC 50 121 In a 2024 study, Farooqui et al., developed a statistically optimized AzA nanoemulsion for enhanced skin delivery. The formulation, prepared by high-speed homogenization and probe sonication, used castor oil and vitamin E as the oil phase, Tween 80 and Transcutol P as surfactant/co-surfactant, and PVA with xanthan gum in the aqueous phase. Optimization via Box–Behnken design yielded a formulation with droplet size 184 nm, PDI 0.202, zeta potential −35.9 mV, and encapsulation efficiency 84.92%. Structural analyses (FTIR, DSC, TGA) confirmed drug stability and incorporation without chemical interaction. In vitro release showed a sustained zero-order release of 87.67% over 12 h (R 2 2 These results underscore the potential of nanoemulsion-based carriers for AzA, offering enhanced penetration, prolonged release, reduced irritancy, and superior patient acceptability in topical treatments for melasma, acne, and hyperpigmentation disorders [ 122 5.3. Emerging Nanocarrier Systems for Potential Application in Azelaic Acid Delivery Although several nanocarrier systems have been investigated for the topical delivery of AzA, numerous advanced platforms widely studied in dermatology remain largely unexplored for this specific compound. Emerging nanotechnologies, such as cubosomes, dendrimers, and polymeric nanoparticles, have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing skin penetration, drug stability and targeted delivery of other dermatological agents. However, their application to AzA remains predominantly theoretical or in early-stage research. These systems warrant further investigation as they may offer innovative solutions to overcome the physicochemical limitations of AzA and expand its therapeutic utility in topical formulations. 5.3.1. Cubosomes (CBs) Cubosomes ( Figure 10 Their structural resemblance to the stratum corneum, along with intrinsic bioadhesive properties, enhances dermal compatibility, facilitate deeper penetration, and promotes prolonged drug retention in the epidermis. Typical cubosome formulation employ glyceryl monooleate (GMO) and phytantriol, as the lipid phase, stabilized by surfactants such as Pluronic F127 to ensure colloidal stability. Drug release from cubosomes follows diffusion-controlled mechanisms and conforms to kinetic models such as Higuchi or Korsmeyer–Peppas, supporting sustained and controlled drug delivery. Compared to conventional vesicular systems, such as liposomes, ethosomes, and transfersomes, cubosomes demonstrate superior physical stability, enhanced skin drug deposition, and reduced drug leakage. Although AzA has not yet been formulated in cubosomes-based formulations, the unique properties of these carriers, including their ability to enhance solubility, mitigate local irritation, and improve skin retention, make them highly suitable candidates for future development in AzA topical delivery. Their tunable particle size, high drug-loading capacity, and favorable safety profile further underscore their potential in advancing dermatological therapies [ 123 124 5.3.2. Dendrimers Dendrimers ( Figure 11 125 126 127 Table 4 The optimized microsponge system was incorporated into a Carbopol 934-based gel, exhibiting suitable pH (5.2–6.8) and spreadability for topical application. In vitro release studies demonstrated sustained drug release over 8 h, with GL-3 formulation achieving 70% cumulative release. Stability testing and in vivo dermal safety studies confirmed long-term physical integrity and non-irritant behavior. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed an extended-release profile and increased systemic exposure (AUC: 32 μg·h/mL) compared to conventional gels. These findings underscore the potential of dendrimer-based systems to improve topical delivery of poorly permeable drugs, such as AzA, by enhancing solubility, stability, and skin compatibility [ 128 5.3.3. Polymeric Nanoparticles Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) are submicron-sized colloidal carriers, typically ranging from 10 to 1000 nm in diameter, and are synthesized from natural or synthetic polymers such as chitosan, ethyl cellulose, polycaprolactone, and polylactide- co Among the various polymers, chitosan has received particular attention due its favorable biocompatibility, mucoadhesive properties, and regulatory approval by the FDA for cutaneous use. Depending on their architecture, PNPs may function as nanospheres (matrix systems) or nanocapsules (reservoir systems), with drug release governed by mechanisms such as swelling, diffusion, enzymatic cleavage, and surface desorption. Several studies have demonstrated the efficiency of chitosan-based PNPs in dermal applications. For instance, nanoparticles loaded with alpha-arbutin or vitamin C, have shown enhanced skin deposition and tyrosinase inhibition than conventional formulations. Similarly, chitosan micelles loaded with glabridin (a prenylated isoflavan) showed improved skin permeation and suppression of melanogenesis. Given these promising results, polymeric nanoparticles represent a compelling strategy the topical delivery of AzA. Their ability to enhance the solubility of poorly water-soluble actives, reduce local irritation, and support sustained, localized drug release positions them as highly suitable carriers for addressing the formulation challenges associated with AzA and improving its therapeutic performance in dermatological applications [ 129 130 5.3.4. Transethosomal Gel Systems Transethosomal gels are advanced topical drug delivery platforms that incorporate transethosomes-ultra-deformable lipid vesicles composed of phospholipids, ethanol, and edge activators-within a gel matrix, typically hydrogel-based. This combination enhances skin permeation, drug encapsulation, stability, and cutaneous residence time, making these systems particularly suitable for the delivery of poorly permeable or irritant-prone active pharmaceutical ingredients [ 131 132 133 Nasr et al. [ 134 3 In vitro release studies demonstrated a sustained release of AzA from the gel (89% over 48 h) compared to 45% for the free drug. Ex vivo permeation studies using mouse skin revealed markedly enhanced dermal penetration (3056 µg/cm 2 2 90 Trichophyton rubrum Microsporum canis T. mentagrophytes 135 5.3.5. Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MSNs) MSNs are inorganic nanocarriers characterized by their highly ordered, porous structure with pore diameters typically ranging from 2 to 50 nm. These nanoparticles exhibit a large surface area, tunable pore volume, and exceptional drug-loading capacity along with excellent biocompatibility. Their surfaces can be easily functionalized, enabling targeted drug delivery, stimuli-responsive release, and the co-delivery of multiple therapeutic agents [ 134 136 To enhance skin delivery and anti-pigmentation efficacy, a mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) gel formulation loaded with AzA was developed. MSNs were synthesized via the sol–gel method using CTAB and TEOS, followed by acid extraction and drug loading. The resulting AzA-MSNs exhibited a particle size of 211.9 nm, a zeta potential of −17.6 mV, and an entrapment efficiency of 93.46%, as measured by UV-spectrophotometry. FE-SEM analysis confirmed spherical, porous particles, while XRD and DSC confirmed the amorphous encapsulation of AzA within the MSN structure, contributing to its improved stability. FTIR spectroscopy verified successful drug loading and template removal. Nitrogen adsorption studies (BET) showed a pore size of 2.47 nm and surface area of 602.5 m 2 137 5.3.6. Lyotropic Liquid Crystals (LLCs) LLCs are self-assembled nanostructured systems formed by amphiphilic molecules (e.g., surfactants or lipids) in the presence of a solvent, typically water. These structures exhibit a unique combination of fluid-like behavior and long-range crystalline order. Depending on their concentration and composition, LLCs can organize into distinct internal geometries including lamellar, hexagonal, or cubic phases. Their biocompatibility, internal compartmentalization, and capacity for sustained release make them attractive platforms for the controlled drug delivery or poorly water-soluble or labile therapeutic agents [ 138 139 In a study by Gowda et al. [ 140 2 2 Cutibacterium acnes Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus aureus 141 Table 5 5.4. Pharmaceutical Cocrystals: Crystal Engineering for Solubility and Delivery Co-crystals are multi-component crystalline structures composed of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and a co-former, both solid at room temperature, held together in a single crystal lattice via non-ionic interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Unlike salts or polymorphs, cocrystals preserve the neutral form of the API and are primarily employed to enhance solubility, bioavailability, stability, and mechanical properties of drugs without altering their pharmacological activity [ 140 Zotova et al. [ 142 Mixtures with LID molar fractions ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 yielded at least two novel crystalline phases and two new liquid forms. A key outcome was the formation of a 2:1 LID/AzA cocrystal, confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), featuring hydrogen bonding involving both AzA carboxyl groups and LID amine sites. Additionally, a novel 2:3 LID: AzA oligomeric ionic liquid phase was identified, representing the first reported example of such a structure involving dicarboxylic acid anions. Characterization via PXRD, DSC, FTIR, TGA, and NMR demonstrated that varying the LID/AzA ratio significantly influenced the thermal behavior, crystallinity, and ionicity of the formulations. Equimolar mixtures exhibited the highest degree of ionization and liquid formation, whereas higher AzA content favored ionic liquids with complex hydrogen bonding networks. These findings highlight AzA’s potential in non-traditional pharmaceutical formulations such as cocrystals and ionic liquids, enabling modulation of physicochemical properties and expanding its topical delivery applications [ 142 In their 2022 study, Yarava et al. [ 143 1 13 1 1 143 Further experimental validation of these systems of AzA delivery is warranted. 5.5. Deep Eutectic Solvents 5.5.1. Fundamentals and Pharmaceutical Classification Recent advances in AzA delivery have increasingly focused on deep eutectic solvents (DESs), an emerging class of liquid systems comprising biocompatible and biodegradable components [ 22 144 Importantly, some DESs incorporate AzA as a structural component of the solvent matrix, forming therapeutic eutectic systems (THEDESs) that offer additional benefits including antimicrobial activity and rheological modulation. Such features position DESs as advanced multifunctional platforms in dermatological formulation science [ 22 DESs are formed by combining a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), typically a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt, with a hydrogen bond donor (HBD), such as an organic acid, polyol, or amide. The extensive hydrogen bonding network between these components disrupts their individual crystalline lattices, resulting in a homogeneous liquid phase at temperatures significantly below the melting points of the pure constituents, a phenomenon known as deep melting point depression that distinguishes DESs from conventional solvents and liquid mixtures [ 144 A classic example is the eutectic system composed of choline chloride (HBA) and urea (HBD) mixed at a 1:2 molar ratio, yielding a liquid at room temperature despite both starting materials being solids under ambient conditions [ 145 146 DESs are typically categorized into four types ( Table 6 - Type I: Metal salt + metal salt (e.g., AlCl 3 - Type II: Metal salt + hydrated metal salt; - Type III: Quaternary ammonium salt (e.g., choline chloride ChCl) + HBD (e.g., glycerol); - Type IV: Metal salt + hydrogen bond donor; Among these, Type III DESs (examples are shown in Figure 12 144 145 146 147 148 5.5.2. Physicochemical Properties of DESs DESs exhibit unique physicochemical characteristics that render them particularly attractive as functional excipients in pharmaceutical formulations, with increasing application in topical drug delivery systems. Solvating capacity: 22 Volatility and thermal stability: 146 149 Rheological properties and viscosity 144 150 Polarity and tunability: 151 Biocompatibility and toxicological profile: 22 144 5.5.3. DES in Pharmaceutical Drug Delivery: Solubility and Skin Penetration Enhancement Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have gained significant attention in pharmaceutical sciences due to their capacity to enhance active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) solubility and transdermal permeation. Their unique physicochemical milieu facilitates both molecular dissolution and the subsequent release of solubilized compounds into biological substrates such as skin [ 152 153 5.5.4. Solubility and Dissolution Enhancement by DES/THEDES Many dermatological agents, including AzA, suffer from limited aqueous solubility, restricting topical bioavailability. DESs overcome this limitation by forming therapeutic deep eutectic solvents (THEDES), where the API often acts as hydrogen bond donor (HBD) within the eutectic system, producing a molecularity homogeneous liquid phase that circumvents crystalline dissolution and markedly enhances thermodynamic activity [ 22 Empirical evidence supports this mechanism. Aroso et al. [ 154 5.5.5. Enhancement of Skin Penetration and Drug Delivery The stratum corneum forms the primary barrier to topical drug adsorption, due to its lipophilic nature, limiting diffusion of polar or large molecules. AzA, with moderate molecular weight of 188.22 g/mol and moderate polarity, exhibits low percutaneous absorption. Traditional penetration enhancers have limited efficacy; however, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) offers innovative dual-function systems that enhance solubility and dermal delivery [ 22 155 22 144 A notable DES/ionic liquid hybrid, choline geranate (CAGE), has shown enhanced delivery of small molecules and biomacromolecules Clinical studies using CAGE-based gels showed therapeutic efficacy in rosacea, highlighting DES potential as penetration enhancers with intrinsic pharmacological activity [ 39 For AzA, DESs mixtures such as malonic acid/choline chloride/ have outperformed standard formulations in vitro diffusion assays. Although ex vivo skin data remain sparse, in vivo outcomes suggest improved delivery [ 144 156 Overall, DESs offer customizable platforms for skin delivery by modulating solubility, drug activity, barrier disruption, barrier disruption and skin hydration, making them highly adaptable for targeting diverse dermatological conditions. 5.5.6. DES-Based Topical Formulations of Azelaic Acid and Related Systems Recent research highlights DESs’ utility in topical AzA formulations. Luhaibi et al. [ 144 144 Hung et al. [ 50 In parallel, Tomić et al. [ 157 Further studies on other pharmacological agents underscore the versatility of DESs. Al-Akayleh et al. [ 158 159 160 Notably, Yang et al. [ 161 5.6. Quality-by-Design (QbD) Optimization The Quality-by-Design (QbD) approach that integrates risk assessment with statistically designed experimentation, has become a recurrent framework for developing topical azelaic-acid (AzA) dosage forms [ 105 162 The optimized vesicles (~4.3 µm, ~92% entrapment) increased ex vivo pig-skin permeation thought pig skin and antibacterial activity compared to a carbopol gel and a marketed 20% AzA cream, while remaining physiochemically stable for three months under ICH conditions [ 105 162 p 5.7. Challenges and Considerations on Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Azelaic Acid Therapy The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into AzA therapy faces challenges common to dermatology, including algorithmic bias, data privacy issues, and difficulties in clinical workflow integration [ 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 Consequently, the broad adoption of AI-guided, nanotechnology-enabled AzA therapies will hinge on parallel advances in curated dermatology datasets, clinician-centered oversight frameworks, and QbD-driven scale-up solutions that lower unit cost while preserving product quality [ 172 Regulatory considerations remain a significant barrier. Any novel AzA vehicle—whether a nanoparticle gel or an AI-driven decision-support platform—must satisfy the full FDA/EMA approval or clearance pathway, the same evidentiary standards that already challenge nanomedicine products. The FDA reports a year-on-year rise in drug-application dossiers that contain artificial-intelligence (AI) components, signaling agency openness to data-driven tools across the product life-cycle [ 173 Dermatology is particularly well suited for personalized approach, as diagnosis and treatment responses are heavily image-based and are already being augmented by AI algorithms that individualize cosmetic and therapeutic plans [ 174 175 176 6. Combination Therapies 6.1. Synergistic Combinations (Azelaic Acid with Retinoids, Antibiotics, Antioxidants) AzA is frequently used in combination with other therapeutic agents to enhance efficacy various dermatological conditions. Synergistic regimens targeting multiple pathogenic pathways have shown promise in treating acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation. Evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates added benefit when AzA is used with topical clindamycin [ 177 178 179 6.2. Enhanced Dermatologic Outcomes with Azelaic Acid-Retinoid Combinations Combining AzA with topical retinoids may yield additive or synergistic effects, especially in pigmentary disorders. For example, in melasma treatment, 20% AzA cream combined with 0.05% tretinoin produced faster and more pronounced pigment reduction than AzA alone [ 179 179 180 181 Despite only moderate objective efficacy, irritation remains a major drawback. In a 12–week trial in Bangladesh evaluating the same combination, 40% of participants reported burning, and 20% developed erythema [ 182 Independent studies on tretinoin monotherapy report erythema and desquamation in up to 88% of users, emphasizing the importance of gradual titration [ 183 184 185 6.3. Azelaic Acid and Antibiotics: A Dual Approach to Inflammatory Skin Disorders AzA possesses bacteriostatic, keratolytic, and free radical-scavenging properties, contributing to both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects [ 3 186 In papulopustular rosacea, a two-phase multicenter study enrolled 172 subjects who received open-label AzA 15% gel twice daily plus doxycycline 100 mg/day for up to 12 weeks. Mean inflammatory lesion reduction exceeded 70%. Responders were then randomized to receive AzA or vehicle for an additional 24 weeks: AzA maintained remission in 75% of patients and significantly delayed relapse [ 178 187 7. Conclusions and Future Directions This review set out to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of AzA (AzA) as a multifunctional dermatologic agent, with a particular emphasis on its formulation challenges, novel delivery strategies, and potential structural innovations to enhance its bioavailability and therapeutic performance. Special attention was given to the persistent limitations in AzA’s aqueous solubility, skin penetration, and compatibility with high-concentration topical formulations, which have long hindered its full clinical potential. Recent advances in nanotechnology-based formulation approaches have emerged as the most promising research areas to overcome these limitations. Systems such as liposomes, ethosomes, niosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanosponges, nanoemulsions, transethosomes, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), and lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) have shown considerable efficacy in improving AzA’s dermal absorption, retention, and tolerability, even at reduced concentrations. These technologies enable controlled and sustained release while mitigating local irritation, a key factor for chronic dermatologic conditions like acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation disorders. Among emerging strategies, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have demonstrated notable capacity to improve both solubility and biocompatibility of AzA, offering a unique solvent platform for stable, non-irritant, high-loading formulations. Additionally, cyclodextrin-based nanosponges significantly enhance AzA’s solubility and antimicrobial efficacy, further supporting their role in high-performance topical systems. Transethosomal gels, MSNs, and nanoemulsions with hyaluronic acid or vitamin E have further expanded the landscape of AzA-compatible excipient systems capable of enhancing both formulation esthetics and clinical outcomes. In terms of future directions, structural modification strategies are gaining traction as a parallel path to improve AzA’s systemic bioavailability and formulation flexibility. One such approach is the development of pharmaceutical cocrystals, as exemplified by recent studies on AzA-lidocaine cocrystals and ionic liquids. These multicomponent systems offer enhanced dissolution profiles, improved thermal and mechanical stability, and better compatibility with other formulation agents, without altering AzA’s pharmacological activity. Moreover, biodegradable polymer-based nanocarriers and functionalized mesoporous structures provide new avenues for targeted delivery, stimuli-responsive release, and dose reduction, paving the way for advanced therapeutic systems with minimized adverse effects. While the majority of research has centered on topical delivery, future investigations may extend to transdermal systems, microneedle-assisted administration, or dual-action formulations that combine AzA with synergistic agents (e.g., antioxidants, retinoids, anti-inflammatories) in a single nanosystem. Integration of AI-assisted formulation design, predictive skin permeation modeling, and smart carriers responsive to pH or oxidative stress could further refine the delivery and personalization of AzA-based therapies. In conclusion, the path forward for AzA lies in the strategic integration of advanced formulation technologies with rational structural design, aiming to unlock its full potential as a safe, effective, and patient-friendly agent in both dermatologic and cosmetic applications. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration among pharmaceutical scientists, material chemists, and clinical dermatologists will be essential to bring these innovations from the bench to bedside.
