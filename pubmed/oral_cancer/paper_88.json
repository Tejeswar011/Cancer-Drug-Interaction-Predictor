Introduction Fluoropyrimidines (FP) are the mainstay of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, but can cause severe toxicity in up to 40% of patients. Variants in the DPYD DPYD DPYD DPYD DPYD Methods 1.279 DPYD DPYD Results Of the twenty-five patients included, sixteen patients (94%) started with a 50% FP dose reduction in the DA cohort while 7 out of 8 patients (87%) in the NDA cohort received 100% of dose in cycle 1. In the DA cohort, 12% of patients experienced severe fluoropyrimidines-related adverse events, compared to 50% in the NDA cohort (OR = 0.13; 95%CI: 0.01–0.93; p = 0.05). FP discontinuation due to severe toxicity occurred in 6% of patients in the DA cohort versus 50% in the NDA cohort (OR = 0.06; 95%CI: 0.003–0.55, p = 0.02).

M. et al. Demonstrated that an initial 50% dose reduction of FP may be sufficient for heterozygous carriers of the nonfunctional DPYD*2A DPYD*13 DPYD*2A DPYD*13 Henricks et al., 2018 Based on the findings of increased risk of severe toxicity with these variants ( Rosmarin et al., 2014 Meulendijks et al., 2015 Terrazzino et al., 2013 DPYD Amstutz et al., 2018 Lunenburg et al., 2020 Garcia-Alfonso et al., 2022 DPYD Furthermore, numerous studies have shown that DPYD Rosmarin et al., 2014 Ruzzo et al., 2017 Henricks et al., 2018 Deenen et al., 2016 DPYD DPYD Consequently, additional research is imperative to elucidate the clinical management of unresolved questions concerning DPYD The aim of our study is to analyze the FP toxicity profile in routine clinical practice, as well as the dose FP adjustment dynamics in heterozygous patients carrying any of the four classical DPYD DPYD 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study population The inclusion criteria of the study were: patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) at Hospital Universitario La Paz; identification of a DPYD DPYD The exclusion criteria were: participation in a clinical trial; concurrent treatment with irinotecan; diagnosis of a non-colorectal malignancy; and a follow-up duration of less than 3 months. 2.2 Study design This is a single-center, ambispective study conducted at Hospital Universitario La Paz. The study was conducted with the approval of the Ethics Committee of La Paz University Hospital (PI-5204) and in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Two cohorts were established: the DPYD DPYD DPYD DPYD DPYD Clinical and genetic variables were collected. Clinical variables were extracted from patient medical records, encompassing a comprehensive array of data. These included sex, age, ECOG performance status, therapeutic intention and treatment regimen administered. Severe (≥ grade 3) FP-related adverse events (SFAEs) were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 at cycle 1 and maximum toxicity at any cycle. Maximum FP dose, initial and final dose adjustments, and discontinuation of FP due to toxicity were also collected. To minimize bias from overestimating FP-related toxicity in patients receiving combination regimens, patients treated with irinotecan (associated with overlapping toxicities) were excluded, and only adverse events specifically attributable to FP were considered. FP-related adverse events were defined as follows: diarrhea, fatigue, emesis, hand-foot syndrome, neutropenia, thrombopenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, mucositis and hyperbilirubinemia. 2.3 DNA extraction and genotyping The DNA extraction and genotyping were performed during routine clinical practice in the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Unit, a multidisciplinary unit integrating the clinical pharmacology and genetics departments ( Stewart et al., 2023 Borobia et al., 2018 DPYD Rosas-Alonso et al., 2021 DPYD*2A DPYD*13 2.4 Treatment recommendations Based on the genotype of both alleles for these variants, an activity score was assigned with a dose reduction recommendation according to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines ( Amstutz et al., 2018 DPYD*2A DPYD*13 Lunenburg et al., 2020 2.5 Statistical analysis Qualitative variables were presented as absolute frequencies and percentages. Quantitative variables were summarized using means or medians, depending on their distribution. The normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Associations between categorical variables were analyzed using binary logistic regression (severe toxicity and treatment discontinuation), Fisher’s test (qualitative baseline characteristics) and t-Student (age). All statistical tests were two-sided, with p-values ≤0.05 considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed using R statistical software, version 4.3.3 ( de With et al., 2023 3 Results 3.1 Characteristics of patients From 1 June 2020 to 28 June 2024 a total of 1,279 DPYD DPYD Supplementary Table S1 DPYD Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Flow diagram for the inclusion of patients D PYD DPYD DPYD Flowchart illustrating the selection process of patients for analysis. Starting with 1,279 patients with available DPYD genotype, 1,219 with wild-type DPYD are excluded. Of the 60 patients with DPYD variants, 35 are further excluded due to reasons such as non-colorectal cancer, non-FP treatment, clinical trial involvement, or insufficient follow-up, leaving 25 patients evaluable for analysis. These are divided into DA cohort with 17 patients and NDA cohort with 8 patients.

In the DA cohort, dose reduction was performed in only one case (6%), whereas for the remaining patients, the doses were either maintained or increased. The FP dosing and modifications or dynamics of dose adjustments for the DA and NDA cohorts are summarized in Table 4 TABLE 4 Fluoropyrimidine dose adjustment dynamics according to the DA and NDA cohorts.

FP, Fluoropyrimidines; DA, DPYD DPYD For the final dose, the DA cohort had a median relative dose intensity of 70%, with 70% of patients receiving more than 50%–75%. The NDA cohort had a median relative dose intensity of 25%, with 63% of patients receiving 0%–50%. FP discontinuation due to toxicity occurred in 6% of patients in the DA cohort and 50% of patients in the NDA cohort (OR = 0.06; 95%CI; 0.003–0.55, p = 0.02) ( Figure 2 In the subgroup of patients with decreased function DPYD Supplementary Table S2 Only four patients had DPYD DPYD*2A DPYD*2A DPYD*13 Finally, the compound heterozygous carrier for c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A completed the FP treatment, starting with a 50% dose reduction, increasing the dose to 66%. In this case, both genotyping and phenotyping were performed: while the genotype inferred an activity score of 1 or partial DPD deficiency, the phenotyping result indicated normal DPD activity. Given this discrepancy, we opted for the safest approach, managing the patient as an activity score 1 carrier. 4 Discussion The implementation of pharmacogenetic testing for fluoropyrimidines has become a reality in Europe following the European Medicines Agency and European Society of Medical Oncology to recommend preemptive DPYD de With et al., 2023 Abad-Santos et al., 2024 Our study showed a prevalence of 4.7% of carriers, which is lower than the frequencies reported in other studies, which reached 8% ( Henricks et al., 2018 Miarons et al., 2023 In our study, patients were treated using either a DPYD Remarkably, the rate of severe toxicity in the NDA cohort (50%) was four times higher than that observed in the DA cohort (12%). A recently published study involving 27 patients, but not limited to CRC, also shows that DPYD DPYD Nguyen et al., 2024 Rosmarin et al., 2014 Meulendijks et al., 2015 Terrazzino et al., 2013 Nguyen et al., 2024 DPYD Henricks et al., 2018 DPYD DPYD Henricks et al., 2018 Nguyen et al., 2024 Wang et al., 2022 Knikman et al., 2021 Another important question is whether the DPYD DPYD DPYD Knikman et al., 2023 DPYD DPYD DPYD DPYD DPYD Henricks et al., 2018 Therefore, the data from our study which exclusively involved CRC patients support that overall, the DPYD However, other questions remain open: how much to adjust the FP dose in the first cycle, whether dose escalation is indicated, or the rate of dose escalation for each DPYD Henricks et al., 2018 Amstutz et al., 2018 Lunenburg et al., 2020 Knikman et al., 2023 DPYD Henricks et al., 2018 This is of particular interest when considering the prognostic uncertainty for patients with the c.1236G>A variant who were treated with an initial 75% dose of FP ( Knikman et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2022 Kleinjan et al., 2019 DPYD Henricks et al., 2018 Concerning DPYD DPYD*2A DPYD*2A Deenen et al., 2016 DPYD DPYD*2A Henricks et al., 2018 Therefore, a treatment strategy that begins with lower doses followed by careful dose escalation could potentially identify patients with poor tolerance, preventing severe toxicity and ensuring treatment completion. Additionally, DPD may be an inducible enzyme ( Yoshida et al., 2015 DPYD DPYD These proposed strategies are consistent with international pharmacogenetic recommendations, although some variability exists across clinical guidelines. The Spanish Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Society, together with the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology, recommend initiating treatment at 50% of the standard dose, followed by dose titration according to toxicity or pharmacokinetic parameters ( Garcia-Alfonso et al., 2022 Lunenburg et al., 2020 Quaranta and Thomas, 2017 This study has several limitations as a single-center ambispective study, potentially leading to underestimated data collection, particularly regarding toxicity. Additionally, the small sample size restricts the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Furthermore, we cannot draw conclusions about efficacy due to potential selection bias. In addition, the fact that the NDA cohort consisted primarily of patients with recurrent or secondary tumors could potentially influence the toxicity results. Nevertheless, the low prevalence of patients with DPYD In conclusion, our study suggests that a more conservative DPYD We are indebted to the Biostatistics core facility of the Hospital La Paz Institute for Health Research (IdiPAZ) for the technical assistance.
