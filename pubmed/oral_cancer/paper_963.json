Introduction Vascular senescence is now recognized as a key driver in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, play a crucial role in cellular aging and vascular health. Indeed, progressive telomere attrition accelerates vascular senescence and atherosclerosis over time [ 1 2 3 4 5 Over the past few years, recent meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization studies across diverse ethnic populations have reported a significant association between shortened leukocyte telomeres and an increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and ischemic heart disease [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 12 13 Astragalus 14 Astragalus membranaceus 15 16 17 18 The cardioprotective effects of Astragalus 15 16 17 18 However, its comprehensive effects on vascular aging and atherosclerosis and plausible mechanisms remain unclear. To shed light on the mechanisms of action and promote future research, this paper reviews and discusses current evidence on the anti-atherosclerotic effects of AM and its active compounds, with a particular focus on their impact on telomere biology and vascular aging. 2. Overview of Telomere Biology Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures located at the ends of chromosomes. They are essential for protecting chromosomes from degradation, fusion, and inappropriate recombination. They consist of a variable number of double-stranded telomeric repeats, 5′-(TTAAGGG)n-3′, together with a terminal region containing a single-stranded G-rich 3′ overhang. This overhang folds into higher-order structures to enhance chromosome end protection [ 19 20 Telomere repeats are associated with the Shelterin multi-protein complex. This complex includes factors that bind specifically to different telomeric regions; the telomere protection 1 (Pot1)-TTP1 heterodimer binds directly to the G-strand overhang, while the double-stranded telomeric region is recognized by the telomere repeat binding factors 1 (TRF1) and the telomere repeat binding factors 2 (TRF2). In addition, these factors interact with proteins such as repressor activator protein 1 (RAP1) and TRF1-interacting nuclear protein 2 (TIN2) [ 20 During DNA replication, telomeres gradually shorten in most somatic cells due to the end-replication problem. Because of this progressive shortening, telomeres function as a biological clock, with their length correlating closely with cellular aging. When telomeres become critically short, the cell activates a DNA damage response, which can lead to cellular senescence (permanent cell cycle arrest) or apoptosis (programed cell death). However, certain cells, such as stem cells, germ cells, and many cancer cells, express telomerase, a reverse transcriptase enzyme that adds telomeric repeats to chromosome ends, thereby counteracting telomere shortening and enabling continued cell division [ 19 20 This enzyme comprises a catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which utilizes the telomerase RNA component (TERC). TERC contains a sequence complementary to the telomeric repeats, enabling the synthesis of new telomeric DNA at the overhang [ 19 20 Improving our understanding of telomere length and maintenance mechanisms, including the controlled and targeted reactivation of telomerase, offers a promising strategy for extending healthy lifespan and treating degenerative diseases by counteracting telomere-driven cellular aging ( Figure 1 3. Astragalus membranaceus Astragalus Astragalus membranaceus 21 Astragalus Astragalus 22 21 Astragalus Astragalus 23 4 6 14 Cycloastragenol (CAG) is another bioactive molecule derived from various species of the Astragalus 24 24 TA-65 is a patented, natural, encapsulated form of cycloastragenol that has gained attention as a safe and effective dietary supplement for promoting healthy aging, with no reported toxicity [ 25 Astragalus astragalus 17 26 The structure and the detailed physicochemical properties of the main Astragalus Figure 2 4. Anti-Senescence Mechanisms and Anti-Aging-Related Effects of Astragalus 4.1. Preclinical and Animal Evidence Several studies have demonstrated that CAG and/or AS IV can delay or mitigate cellular senescence and apoptosis under various experimental conditions [ 27 28 27 28 29 29 The CAG has been shown to enhance telomerase activity in neuronal cells via activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB), a key transcription factor required for upregulating TERT expression and downstream telomerase function [ 28 24 +/− 30 31 Furthermore, co-administration of AS IV and CAG has been shown to enhance telomerase activity via activation of the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase/Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (Src/MEK/ERK) signaling cascade [ 27 23 32 The CAG has been found to induce regulated protein kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK293) and neonatal keratinocytes by engaging the Src/MEK/ERK pathway [ 27 Like CAG and AS-IV, TA-65 is a small-molecule telomerase activator, commercially available on the market since 2008. Since its introduction, it has been investigated in preclinical and early clinical work for its potential role in promoting telomere maintenance and cellular health [ 33 +/− 30 In addition, the dietary supplementation of 25 mg/kg per day of TA-65 is capable of inducing an improvement of certain health-span indicators, including glucose tolerance, osteoporosis and skin fitness, without significantly increasing global cancer incidence [ 30 Moreover, TA-65 showed protective effects in mouse models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cigarette-smoke damage. This protective effect was associated with a decreased expression of the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in the small airway walls of CS-exposed mice, together with a protection against fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation in response to TGF-β1 in lung primary fibroblast in vitro [ 34 4.2. Human Investigation Studies Human studies have also supported these in vitro findings, indicating that TA-65 can positively influence telomere length in healthy individuals [ 33 A study of 117 relatively healthy individuals aged 53–87 years and positive for cytomegalovirus found that a low dose of TA-65 (250 U) significantly increased telomere length over 12 months, whereas participants in the placebo group experienced significant telomere shortening [ 35 A placebo-controlled study recruiting a large number of healthy adults (500) showed that oral intake of TA-65 across all doses (100 U, 250 U, and 500 U) for nine months significantly decreased CD8 + − 36 Similarly, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month trial involving 40 healthy volunteers, participants taking an Astragalus 37 Although these data suggest that telomerase therapies and pharmacological interventions can counteract the effects of telomere attrition, their role in vascular biology and atherosclerosis is still largely unknown. 5. Astragalus 5.1. Effects on HUVEC Endothelial cells, which are essential elements of the arterial intima, play a key role in regulating vascular function and preserving internal homeostasis. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by reduced nitric oxide production, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory signaling, drives atherosclerosis by promoting plaque formation, immune cell recruitment, and lipid accumulation in the arterial wall [ 38 As previously mentioned, telomere shortening is strongly associated with vascular dysfunction by promoting cellular senescence, which impairs vascular repair, elevates oxidative stress, and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis [ 1 2 3 Numerous studies have demonstrated the protective effects of AS IV against vascular endothelial dysfunction [ 39 40 41 In agreement with these data, Wang et al. demonstrated that AS IV (10, 40, and 120 μM) significantly promotes proliferation, migration, and tube formation in HUVECs via ERK1/2 phosphorylation and JAK2/STAT3 pathway activation [ 42 AS IV also exhibits antioxidant properties in oxidative injury models. Xu et al. reported that AS IV (20–100 μmol/L) increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in H 2 2 43 44 Qiu et al. observed that AS IV at doses of 50 and 100 mg/mL mitigated Homocysteine (HCY)-induced endothelial dysfunction, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, by reducing ROS accumulation and enhancing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, thereby restoring cellular homeostasis [ 45 46 Complementary to these findings, Chen et al. explored the molecular basis of AS-IV’s protective effects against ox-LDL-induced endothelial injury. AS IV treatment inactivated the NF-κB pathway by regulating the histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), leading to reduced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory signaling [ 47 Together, these findings highlight AS IV as a multifunctional compound with significant potential in the prevention and treatment of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis through different molecular pathways. 5.2. Effects on VSMCs Like endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play a key role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis by contributing to plaque formation, vascular wall remodeling, and the regulation of inflammation and calcification [ 48 However, studies investigating the protective effects of Astragalus membranaceus 49 50 Further supporting evidence comes from Lu et al., who found that AS IV (50 μg/mL) restored Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) production in Angiotensin II-induced VSMCs. Additionally, AS IV reversed mitochondrial dysfunction by enhancing oxygen consumption rates, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and boosting mitochondrial DNA content. These mitochondrial improvements were accompanied by a reduction in ROS production, increased SOD activity, and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy [ 51 Consistent with these findings, Li et al. reported that AS IV attenuated senescence in bleomycin-induced VSMCs by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, improving mitochondrial integrity, and promoting mitophagy. This anti-senescent effect was mediated via Parkin upregulation, highlighting the relevance of AS-IV-induced mitophagy in preserving VSMCs homeostasis [ 52 However, in another study, Song et al. demonstrated that AS IV (50 μg/mL) can inhibit the autophagy and mineralization of VSMCs by increasing the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 (lncRNA H19) and decreasing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5) [ 53 Table 1 Figure 3 Astragalus 5.3. In Vivo Effects on Atherosclerosis and Plaque Several in vivo studies have investigated the anti-atherosclerotic effects of astragaloside IV, particularly in murine models of atherosclerosis ( Table 2 −/− 53 Similarly, Wang et al. reported that AS IV treatment at 40 mg/kg reduced lipid-rich areas in atherosclerotic plaques of ApoE −/− 54 −/− 55 Moreover, Sun et al. found that daily AS IV administration at 20 mg/kg in rats upregulated Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) through NF-κB inhibition, resulting in decreased serum concentrations of ox-LDL, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-6, and IL-18, thereby suppressing atherosclerosis progression [ 56 −/− 57 58 Beyond direct vascular and anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of lipid metabolism represents another key mechanism by which Astragalus 59 60 61 Astragalus 5.4. Human Clinical Studies Limited but promising clinical data have also demonstrated improvements in cardiac function and oxidative stress markers in acute myocardial infraction and ischemic heart disease. Indeed, some preliminary Chinese observational studies have reported positive effects of Astragalus 62 63 A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with metabolic syndrome were allocated to consume either 16 mg daily of a TA-65 supplement or a placebo for 12 weeks showed that there was an improvement in risk factors for cardiovascular disease, with reduced inflammatory levels (low TNF-α levels) and a parallel reduction in body mass index, waist circumference, and atherosclerotic ratio LDL-C/High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) [ 64 More recently, the Telomerase ACTivator to reverse Immunosenescence in Acute Coronary Syndrome (TACTIC) study, a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, evaluated for the first time whether TA-65 can reduce immune cell aging in patients following myocardial infarction. The study demonstrated that one year of treatment with TA-65 significantly enhanced telomerase activity in immune cells, resulting in a marked reduction in systemic inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Additionally, it improved lymphocyte proliferation and decreased signs of immune senescence. These findings highlight the promising therapeutic role for TA-65 in modulating post-infarction inflammation and immune function [ 65 6. Conclusions and Perspectives Telomere dysfunction has emerged as a critical contributor to vascular senescence, a key process in the development of age-related cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. This strong association highlights the potential of therapeutic strategies that enhance telomere biology to prevent or slow the progression of atherosclerosis. Within this context, Astragalus membranaceus As discussed above, these agents exert pleiotropic effects on vascular biology, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, endothelial-protective, and lipid-regulating actions. Mechanistically, they influence key signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and ROS/NF-κB, while also modulating telomerase activity and telomere maintenance, both increasingly recognized as central regulators of vascular senescence and plaque instability. Despite these encouraging findings, the precise molecular targets of Astragalus membranaceus A promising avenue for future research is to determine whether shelterin-related complexes act as intermediaries or modulators of the effects of Astragalus membranaceus 66 Astragalus In addition, telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), a long non-coding RNA transcribed from telomeric regions, has emerged as a significant regulator of telomere integrity and telomerase activity [ 67 Astragalus membranaceus Moreover, it is becoming increasingly evident that telomerase exerts multiple non-canonical functions beyond telomere length maintenance, including roles in DNA damage response, transcriptional regulation, and mitochondrial function. Notably, recent studies suggest that astragaloside IV also modulates mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, particularly in VSMCs exposed to senescence-inducing stimuli such as angiotensin II. AS IV promotes Parkin-mediated mitophagy and supports mitochondrial homeostasis, factors now recognized as critical in the regulation of vascular aging [ 52 Astragalus Consequently, future studies should elucidate the impact of Astragalus membranaceus To elucidate these relationships, future in vitro studies should investigate the effects of astragaloside IV, cycloastragenol, and TA-65 on telomerase activity, telomere length maintenance, mitochondrial dynamics, and senescence markers in both HUVECs and VSMCs, particularly under conditions of oxidative or inflammatory stress. Although preliminary preclinical and clinical data are encouraging, comprehensive randomized controlled trials and long-term safety assessments are still required. Future research should also aim to define dose–response relationships, explore potential synergistic effects with standard therapies, and validate robust biomarkers of vascular rejuvenation. Additionally, given that these compounds act as telomerase activators and that telomerase reactivation is implicated in more than 80% of human tumors [ 68 These efforts will be essential for establishing therapeutic efficacy, safety, and clinical utility of Astragalus Acknowledgments All the figures of this manuscript were created with biorender.com.
