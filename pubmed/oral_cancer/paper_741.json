Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which help the immune system attack cancer cells, have shown promise in canine studies. This exploratory, randomized clinical study evaluated the safety and efficacy of an anti-PD-L1 antibody, HFC-L1 (also known as c4G12), in dogs with pulmonary metastatic oral malignant melanoma. Twenty-six dogs were treated with three different doses of HFC-L1 (2, 5, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). The safety profiles were similar across all dose groups, and no severe treatment-related adverse events were observed. Dogs treated with higher doses (5 or 10 mg/kg) showed numerically longer overall survival compared to the 2 mg/kg group. These findings suggest that HFC-L1 therapy is well tolerated and that higher doses may provide improved clinical benefit. Although the study was exploratory in nature with a small sample size, the results support the use of 5–10 mg/kg as the preferred dose in future clinical studies. This research contributes to the development of immunotherapy for canine cancers and may also inform comparative oncology approaches relevant to human medicine. Abstract Oral malignant melanoma (OMM) is a highly aggressive malignancy in dogs. The development of effective systemic therapies is urgently required to improve the treatment of canine OMM. Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been investigated in canines following their dramatic success in human cancer treatment; however, there is still a need for extensive veterinary clinical studies to clarify and optimize their clinical benefits. Among the ICIs under development for canine cancer immunotherapy, c4G12 (HFC-L1), a canine chimeric anti-PD-L1 antibody, has shown promising efficacy in dogs with pulmonary metastatic OMM in previous clinical studies. However, the optimal dose of HFC-L1/c4G12 has not yet been determined. To explore the dose–response relationship of HFC-L1, a multicenter, randomized clinical study was conducted using three different doses (2, 5, or 10 mg/kg via intravenous infusion every 2 weeks) to treat dogs with pulmonary metastatic OMM ( n canine tumor immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy malignant melanoma programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) 21K14983 23K23768 25K02162 25K02163 Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) JP223fa627005 JP25ama121008 This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Grant Numbers: 21K14983, 23K23768, 25K02162, and 25K02163) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) and by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) (Grant Numbers: JP223fa627005 and JP25ama121008).

Introduction Malignant melanoma is a relatively common neoplasm in dogs that often arises in the haired skin, digits (nail bed), and oral cavity [ 1 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Immunotherapy has been proposed as an effective systemic therapy for malignant melanoma in humans [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 17 21 22 18 21 22 18 22 In previous clinical studies using c4G12, the antibody drug was administered at 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks in most cases, with some exceptions in which dogs were treated at 2 mg/kg, based on the veterinarians’ discretion [ 18 22 23 24 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Overview of the Clinical Study This clinical study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, non-blinded, dose–response study of HFC-L1 to explore the optimal dosage for treating canine pulmonary metastatic OMM. The clinical study was conducted at the veterinary teaching hospitals of Hokkaido University (HU), Azabu University (AU), and Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine (OUAVM) between November 2021 and February 2024, with the approval of the Ethics Committee or Institutional Animal Care Committee (approval numbers: HU, 2021-08; AU, 19403-5 and 220308-1; OUAVM, 21-164). Dogs met the following inclusion criteria for enrolment in the clinical study: (1) dogs diagnosed with stage IV OMM, as defined by the TNM-based World Health Organization staging scheme [ 25 n n n n 18 22 23 24 18 2.2. Assessment of Safety Routine follow-up, including physical examination, complete blood count, and blood chemistry, was performed every 2 weeks to monitor adverse events. After the first 6 weeks, blood tests were scheduled every 6 weeks. Additional assessments for adverse events [including urinalysis, thoracic or abdominal radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging] were performed when clinically required. Adverse events were classified and graded according to the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group–Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (VCOG-CTCAE) v1.1 [ 26 2.3. Evaluation of Tumor Response Tumor response to HFC-L1 treatment was defined according to the response evaluation criteria for solid tumors in dogs (cRECIST) v1.0 [ 27 n 2.4. Evaluation of Survival The OS of the dogs was defined as the time (days) from the first HFC-L1 dose to death. The survival after the diagnosis of PM was defined as the time (days) from the first diagnosis of PM to death [ 18 22 Dogs that survived for >4 months on HFC-L1 treatment were considered long-term survivors, based on a previous finding that dogs with pulmonary metastatic OMM treated with the best available therapy and/or supportive care (historical control group, n 22 2.5. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using EZR (version 1.35) [ 28 p 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Population Twenty-six dogs were enrolled, including 18 dogs at HU, seven dogs at AU, and one dog at OUAVM. All dogs were histopathologically or cytopathologically diagnosed with malignant melanoma originating from the oral cavity, and clinical evidence of PM was confirmed by diagnostic imaging using chest radiography or CT. The dogs were randomly assigned to three dose groups: 2 mg/kg ( n n n n n 27 n Table 1 3.2. Safety of HFC-L1 Therapy All TRAEs are listed in Table 2 p 3.3. Tumor Response to HFC-L1 Therapy To achieve local tumor control, most dogs had received prior surgery and/or radiation therapy for the primary tumor before enrolment in this clinical study; thus, measurable target lesions were not available for these dogs and were excluded from the response evaluation. Among dogs with target disease ( n Figure 1 Table 3 3.4. Comparison of OS The median OS of HFC-L1–treated dogs was 46 days [95% confidence interval (CI): 1–not applicable (NA) days] in the 2 mg/kg group, 101 days (95% CI: 15–315 days) in the 5 mg/kg group, and 109 days (95% CI: 10–NA days) in the 10 mg/kg group. The median OS was numerically longer in the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups than that in the 2 mg/kg group; however, there was no significant difference between the groups ( p Figure 2 n p Figure 2 Supplementary Table S1 3.5. Comparison of Survival After the Diagnosis of PM To enable comparisons with the historical control data, survival after the diagnosis of PM was calculated for dogs treated with HFC-L1 at HU. Since the historical control data were collected at HU [ 18 22 n n n n p p p Supplementary Figure S1A–C n p Supplementary Figure S1D Together, these findings suggest that the clinical benefit of HFC-L1 treatment is more apparent in the higher-dose groups. 4. Discussion In this exploratory, randomized, dose–response study of HFC-L1, the type, frequency, and severity of TRAEs were similar between the dose groups, suggesting that HFC-L1 therapy was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The OS of the treated dogs did not significantly differ among the groups; however, a numerically longer median OS was reported in the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups than in the 2 mg/kg group. Collectively, these findings suggest that HFC-L1 therapy at doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg may provide improved survival without increasing toxicity. The major limitation of the current clinical study was the small sample size for each dose group ( n 22 24 The TRAEs reported in this study were consistent with those of previous reports on c4G12 in dogs [ 18 22 23 24 29 30 In conclusion, although the study was exploratory in nature with a small sample size, this multicenter, randomized, dose–response study of HFC-L1 demonstrated that a high dose (5 or 10 mg/kg) was associated with a numerically longer OS and acceptable safety profiles. We propose that 5–10 mg/kg is the preferred dose in future clinical studies using HFC-L1/c4G12. As future directions, a large-scale confirmatory study for optimal dose determination should be conducted with appropriate stratification factors (e.g., PD-L1 status and prior therapies). In addition, to maximize the clinical benefit of HFC-L1/c4G12 therapy, biomarkers for predicting treatment outcomes and combination strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy (e.g., with radiation [ 23 31 Acknowledgments We thank all the veterinary staff in the veterinary teaching hospitals of Hokkaido University, Azabu University, and Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine for their assistance throughout the clinical study.
