Introduction Progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) presents a significant clinical challenge, characterised by the relentless and irreversible scarring of lung tissue, ultimately leading to a progressive decline in respiratory function [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 A confluence of clinical, physiological, and radiological factors has been identified that increases the risk of developing a progressive course. These risk factors, consistent across multiple ILD subtypes, include older age, male sex, a history of cigarette smoking, lower baseline pulmonary function, as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC) and alveolar-capillary diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and, most notably, the presence of a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The approval of the anti-fibrotic agents nintedanib and pirfenidone has marked a significant shift in PPF management [ 16 17 18 2. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted collaboratively by the Radiology and the Respiratory Units of “Magna Græcia” University Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy. The inclusion criteria were based on the diagnosis of PPF according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)/Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS)/Latin American Thoracic Society (LATS) clinical practice guideline [ 19 2.1. Analysis Using 3D Slicer Quantitative analysis was performed using 3D Slicer (3D Slicer, https://www.slicer.org 20 21 22 Figure 1 Figure 2 2.2. Lung Function Tests Spirometry and body plethysmography were performed using the MasterScreen pulmonary function testing system and a MasterScreen Body (Jaeger-Viasys; CareFusion, Höchberg, Germany), following ATS/ERS guidelines [ 23 1 25–75 2.3. Statistical Analysis The mean ± standard deviation (SD) was used for normally distributed data, while the median value with interquartile range (IQR) was used for skewed data distributions. Based on normality, parametric or non-parametric tests were selected. Data normality was evaluated through Anderson–Darling and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. When appropriate, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired t p 2.4. Ethical Statement This observational study adhered to the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Furthermore, informed consent was obtained from all patients. Our investigation was conducted by the guidelines provided by the local Ethical Committee of the Calabria Region (Catanzaro, Italy; document no. 118, dated 9 April 2024). 3. Results Forty-five patients with PPF in treatment with nintedanib were enrolled, and thirty-seven (82.22%) completed one year of treatment. Among the 37 patients included in this study, 28 (75.68%) were male. Their mean age was 73.62 ± 7.04 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.53 ± 3.26 kg/m 2 A significant reduction was observed in right lung infiltration, decreasing from 5.56 ± 3.08 cm 3 3 p p 3 3 p 3 3 p 3 3 p 3 3 p Table 1 Table 2 During the same period, RV did not show statistically significant changes, varying from 1.49 ± 0.56 L to 1.29 ± 0.63 L ( p p p Table 3 To identify potential predictors of radiologic response, Pearson correlation analyses were conducted between the percentage change in infiltration (Δ infiltration) and all available clinical, radiologic, and functional parameters.

We also performed a ROC analysis to evaluate the ability of the pre-treatment infiltrated volume (%) to predict the occurrence of progression criteria during nintedanib treatment. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.767, indicating moderate discriminative ability of the baseline infiltrated percentage in identifying individuals at risk of pulmonary fibrosis progression on treatment ( Figure 3 Adverse events aligned with the known safety profile of nintedanib. Gastrointestinal issues were most common—diarrhoea in 48.65% and nausea/vomiting in 40.54%—and generally ranged from mild to moderate, occurring early after treatment began. Most were managed conservatively with supportive care; when necessary, brief treatment pauses or dose reductions to 100 mg twice daily enabled continued therapy with re-escalation as tolerated. Permanent discontinuation occurred in 3 patients (7.5%). Overall, the tolerability profile in our group reflects previous trial and real-world data and supports the feasibility of maintaining long-term treatment in routine practice. 4. Discussion This study leverages AI-powered QCT to offer a granular, objective assessment of nintedanib’s impact on the lung parenchyma in a real-world cohort of PPF. Our findings present a complex and nuanced picture of therapeutic response, highlighting both the promise of advanced imaging biomarkers and the intricate, multifaceted pathophysiology of the disease [ 24 25 26 The “infiltration” class in our AI-powered QCT analysis, defined by Hounsfield Units in the range of −750 to −400 HU, is believed to encompass a spectrum of parenchymal abnormalities, including ground-glass opacities and fine reticular patterns. These features often represent areas of active inflammation, cellular infiltration, and early, potentially modifiable fibrotic deposition. Nintedanib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, exerts its anti-fibrotic effect by targeting key signalling pathways involved in fibroblast proliferation, migration, differentiation, and extracellular matrix deposition, including those mediated by fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) [ 27 28 29 Our results fundamentally challenge the sufficiency of FVC as a standalone endpoint for assessing therapeutic response in both clinical practice and research settings. In our cohort, the stability of FVC over one year, if viewed in isolation, could be interpreted as therapeutic success or disease stabilisation. This finding is of critical importance, as FVC remains the primary endpoint in most clinical trials for anti-fibrotic therapies and the principal metric for clinical decision-making. It underscores the urgent need for more sensitive, multi-faceted assessment tools that can provide a more holistic view of the disease state. This study reinforces the substantial value proposition of AI-powered QCT as a critical tool for the objective and sensitive monitoring of fibrosing lung disease, a concept strongly supported by a growing body of the literature advocating for the use of automated quantitative methods. The key advantages demonstrated in our analysis are many-fold. First, AI-powered QCT provides a level of objectivity and reproducibility that is unattainable with traditional, semi-quantitative visual scoring of HRCT scans, which is known to be subject to significant inter- and intra-observer variability. Second, the granularity afforded by AI-powered QCT is a considerable advance. The ability to segment the lung into distinct tissue classes based on density—such as infiltrated, collapsed, emphysematous, and usually inflated lung—allows for a differential analysis of the therapeutic effect on various pathological components. This is a far more sophisticated approach than relying on global physiological measures, such as FVC, which represent the integrated output of the entire respiratory system and can be influenced by numerous factors. Finally, the sensitivity of AI-powered QCT may allow for the detection of subtle parenchymal changes that precede a functionally significant decline, potentially establishing it as an earlier and more responsive biomarker of treatment efficacy or failure. However, the interpretation of our AI-powered QCT findings requires scientific rigour and caution. While our study provides a detailed, mechanistic view of radiological change in a small, well-characterised cohort, its clinical relevance can only be fully understood when placed in the context of larger, real-world effectiveness studies. The recent Italian, observational, multicentre study by Mondoni et al. provides the ideal clinical framework for this interpretation [ 30 31 32 33 34 Perhaps the most significant contribution of our study is its exploration of baseline parameters to predict individual patient trajectories, representing a crucial step toward a more personalised medicine approach for PPF, rather than assessing average treatment effects. Our ROC analysis showed that a high baseline burden of total infiltration—specifically, a value greater than 21.90%—was a moderate predictor of experiencing disease progression. Patients who start with a high disease burden are already far along the fibrotic continuum. Even if nintedanib effectively reduces the rate of new infiltration, their lungs are so structurally compromised that even a slight absolute decline in function is more likely to cross the relative threshold for clinical progression. Their overall prognosis remains poor despite a measurable drug effect on one component of their disease. This suggests the existence of a potential “therapeutic window”, where patients with an intermediate level of active disease may derive the most significant net clinical benefit. While preliminary and in need of extensive validation, this 21.90% AI-powered QCT threshold represents a tangible first step toward a quantitative, imaging-based risk stratification tool. In the future, clinicians could potentially use baseline AI-powered QCT analysis to identify patients at high risk for progression despite standard therapy. These individuals might then be targeted for more frequent monitoring, more aggressive management of comorbidities, or prioritisation for enrolment in clinical trials of novel combination therapies. Currently, AI-powered QCT should be regarded as a complement to respiratory functional testing. Decisions to continue, modify, or switch antifibrotic therapy should be based on clinical status, lung function trends, imaging biomarkers, oxygen needs, and history of exacerbations. The primary limitation of our study is related to its retrospective design, which inherently carries a risk of selection and information bias, as well as its small, single-centre cohort of 37 patients. This limits statistical power and broadens confidence intervals, increasing the possibility of effect overestimation for individual QCT markers (e.g., infiltrated volume). Furthermore, his single-arm design mirrors real-world treatment pathways and aims to reduce interpatient heterogeneity by using each participant as their own control. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study demonstrates that AI-powered QCT analysis is a powerful tool for dissecting the complex and heterogeneous effects of nintedanib on the lung parenchyma in patients with PPF. Most importantly, this work presents preliminary but compelling evidence that baseline quantitative imaging can serve as a predictive biomarker to stratify patients and anticipate their clinical trajectory. The identification of a prognostic AI-powered QCT threshold, though requiring validation, paves the way for a future of more personalised and precise management of this devastating disease. The translation of these promising findings into routine clinical practice is contingent upon rigorous validation in prospective, multicentre studies, which should be a high priority for the respiratory research community. Taken together, our results underscore the utility of AI-derived radiologic biomarkers in detecting early treatment responses and potentially anticipating functional decline. While changes in FVC and DLCO remain cornerstone endpoints, radiologic features—particularly infiltrated volume—may offer additional prognostic information and refine risk stratification in PPF. In fact, rather than challenging the adequacy of FVC as a primary endpoint, our results emphasise the complementary role of QCT as an addition to functional testing. Larger, prospective, case-control studies are needed to verify whether QCT can consistently detect treatment-related changes that happen before or alongside spirometric decline, providing valuable insights into long-term outcomes and modifications in follow-up HRCT.

Segmentation of the left lung is represented in orange; segmentation of the right lung is represented in green. Figure 2 Example of a “LungCTAnalyzer results” report from an enrolled patient, including volumetric and extended analysis. Segments are created based on their Hounsfield units, using predefined threshold ranges. Functional versus affected lung volumes are shown. “Infiltration” and “Collapsed” currently include perivascular/bronchial tissues and will also never be zero. Figure 3 Analysis of the ROC curve for the identification of pulmonary fibrosis progression, stratified according to baseline infiltrated percentage. medicina-61-01646-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Volumetric analysis parameters before and after 12 months of treatment with nintedanib.
