See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Estrogens are a group of steroid hormones produced by ovary, placenta, and other organs. They have historically been associated with female reproduction, but according to current evidence estrogens regulate also male reproductive and nonreproductive organs. Estrogens play a crucial role in female reproductive development and maintenance either directly by increasing glycogen levels, epithelial thickness and mucus secretion or indirectly, by decreasing vaginal pH through the maintenance of lactobacilli dominance and lactic acid production. Several studies demonstrated that dysbiosis and/or specific bacteria could have impact on the development of sex-hormone driven cancers such as endometrial, cervical, ovarian, breast and prostate cancers, through mechanisms involving modulation of estrogen metabolism. This modulation is realized through secretion of β-glucuronidase which deconjugates estrogens into their active forms. When gut dysbiosis occurs, microbial diversity decreases and so the deconjugation diminishes leading to a decrease of circulating estrogens. Low levels of circulating estrogen may adversely affect a wide range of physiological factors, with clinical implications especially for gut health. In this review, we discuss the different aspects of the critical interplay between gut microbiome and estrogens in sex-hormone driven cancers and the potential outcomes on their clinical management.

These estrogens are also applied exogenously for their high therapeutic potential[ 9 E1, E2, and E3 are metabolized through phase I including hydroxylation, oxidation and reduction reactions and phase II comprising primarily conjugation reactions, while E4undergoes exclusively phase II reactions[ 9 Estrogen metabolites are variable in terms of nature and quantity depending on their endogenous formation, chemical structure and route of administration of exogenous estrogens. Before being excreted in urine and/or feces, some hydroxylated metabolites may interact with ERs (ERα and ERβ) and generate significant hormonal responses in target tissues while others can elicit unique biological effects unrelated to ER activation[ 9 9 11 Furthermore, epidemiological studies have documented that the metabolic syndrome, referring to a disorder in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and other substances in the human body[ 5 12 5 5 12 Estrogen and oncobiome in females Estrogens are a main GM regulator and reciprocally, the GM is acting in the control of estrogen levels[ 13 13 13 13 Despite the fact that microbial diversity is multifactorial, many studies found an association between estrogen with its subsequent metabolites and microbial taxa characterized by specific diversity and GM composition in both healthy and disease conditions[ 11 14 Finally, the GM is suggested to modify host immunity through affecting various immunologic pathways, therefore influencing cancer risk and treatment outcomes in many malignancies[ 15  Ovarian cancer: Proteobacteria Firmicutes Chlamydia trachomatis, Lactobacillus Mycobacterium 4 Proteobacteria 4 16 Proteobacteria 16 17 18 Firmicutes 16 et al 16 Proteobacteria Firmicutes Acinetobacter_lwoffii Acinetobacters 19 16 Lactococcus_piscium Lactococcus 16  Endometrial cancer: 20 21 et al 22 Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Bifidobacterium 2 23 21 24 4 4 Porphyromonas Atopobium vaginae 4 4 25 1 Table 1 Gut oncobiome in the different types of cancer  Gender  Cancer type  Gut oncobiome  Ref.
