Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and lenalidomide are the standard therapies; however, their effectiveness is limited by resistance and patient selection criteria. Luspatercept, a transforming growth factor-beta superfamily ligand trap, has shown improved transfusion independence and is now considered a frontline option for a broader group of patients. Clinical trials have indicated that luspatercept provides a sustained response in several cases. Imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor, offers an alternative for patients who do not respond to ESAs and has been shown to reduce the clonal mutation burden, suggesting possible disease-modifying effects. However, unresolved issues remain, such as the lack of predictive biomarkers to guide therapy selection, uncertainty about the optimal sequencing or combination of available treatments, and the fact that most patients eventually progress to higher-risk disease. Additionally, the real-world use of these new agents remains limited in some regions owing to issues with local introduction and reimbursement. This review summarizes recent clinical data on luspatercept and imetelstat, highlights their current limitations, and discusses areas for future research based on recent trial outcomes and evolving clinical practices.

The complexity of MDS biology, characterized by clonal heterogeneity, divergent mutational landscapes, and a microenvironment that favors immune evasion, has hindered the development of targeted and immune therapies [ 4 6 7 8 9 10 This therapeutic stagnation persists despite deeper molecular characterization of MDS. Next-generation sequencing has identified recurrent mutations in SF3B1 TP53 TET2 ASXL1 11 13 14 15 16 17 18 Despite ongoing challenges in MDS drug development, including the absence of predictive biomarkers, inconsistent clinical trial endpoints, and a limited understanding of clonal evolution dynamics, recent FDA approvals of luspatercept [ 19 20 21 22 23 In this review, we summarize the clinical evidence for these two newly approved anemia-correction agents and discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions that may help advance MDS treatment beyond current standards. Normal and dysregulated erythropoiesis in Lower-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes (LR-MDS) Early and late erythropoiesis Erythropoiesis, the process by which red blood cells (RBCs) are produced, is a complex and tightly regulated sequence of events that can be broadly divided into early and late stages. In the early phase, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells differentiate into erythroid progenitors such as burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-erythroid. This expansion is primarily driven by erythropoietin (EPO), which binds to its receptor (EPOR) and activates downstream signaling pathways, notably the JAK2/STAT5 axis, to promote cell survival and proliferation [ 24 25 As erythropoiesis progresses to the late stage, the maturation of proerythroblasts into reticulocytes becomes increasingly influenced by the modulatory transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily of cytokines, such as GDF11 and activins. These ligands interact with specific type II receptors (ACVR2A/B), leading to the activation of SMAD2/3 signaling. This pathway exerts an inhibitory effect on erythroid maturation, inducing apoptosis and causing maturation arrest, which is particularly pronounced in pathological states such as MDS [ 24 26 27 Dysregulated late erythropoiesis in LR-MDS In LR-MDS, multiple disruptions of this finely tuned process become evident. Despite the elevated endogenous EPO levels, erythroid progenitors in LR-MDS frequently exhibit resistance to EPO stimulation. This resistance is attributed to the downregulation of EPOR and increased expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling proteins, such as SOCS1 and SOCS3, which blunt STAT5 phosphorylation and diminish the proliferative response to EPO [ 28 SF3B1 29 31 32 Impaired telomere maintenance in LR-MDS Telomere maintenance is essential for the function of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and its dysregulation is a key feature of LR-MDS. In healthy hematopoiesis, telomerase activity preserves telomere length, supporting sustained cell division and genomic stability. However, in LR-MDS, clonal HSCs experience accelerated telomere shortening, often outpacing the compensatory capacity of telomerase [ 33 34 The pathophysiology of LR-MDS is further complicated by chronic inflammatory signals in the bone marrow microenvironment that intensify oxidative stress and contribute to telomere shortening. As telomeres shorten, the affected HSCs become increasingly prone to DNA damage, resulting in impaired erythropoiesis and persistent cytopenia. Patients with shorter telomeres have a higher risk of leukemic transformation and poorer survival [ 35 37 Current therapies for anemia correction in LR-MDs: Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs) and lenalidomide ESAs ESAs, including epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa, remain the initial therapeutic choice for anemia in LR-MDS. These agents enhance erythropoiesis by activating the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway via EPOR binding. While ESAs achieve hematologic improvement in approximately 40% of patients, responses are often transient (median duration: 1.5–2 years) [ 38 41 42 43 Lenalidomide in del(5q) LR-MDS Lenalidomide represents a significant advancement for patients with LR-MDS with an isolated chromosome 5q deletion (del[5q]). Its mechanism involves synthetic lethality, selectively targeting malignant clones through cereblon (CRBN)-mediated proteasomal degradation of casein kinase 1α (CK1α). This degradation stabilizes p53, inducing apoptosis in del(5q) cells with CSNK1A1 haploinsufficiency while sparing normal hematopoiesis [ 44 45 46 47 48 Luspatercept: a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent Luspatercept is a recombinant fusion protein designed to modulate TGF-β superfamily signaling. Its mechanism involves binding to ligands such as GDF11 and activins via a modified extracellular domain of activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB), effectively acting as a “ligand trap.” By inhibiting aberrant Smad2/3 signaling, luspatercept promotes late-stage erythroid maturation, addressing the ineffective erythropoiesis characteristics of MDS [ 49 51 Clinical evidence and approval in LR-MDS with ring sideroblasts or mutated SF3B1 The PACE-MDS study evaluated luspatercept in all patients with LR-MDS and demonstrated overall robust erythroid responses. Patients with ring sideroblasts (RS-positive) and SF3B1 52 53 P P 19 These results highlight the heightened sensitivity of RS-positive and SF3B1 54 SF3B1 55 56 SF3B1 Broader approval to whole LR-MDS As positive results were observed in prior research on LR-MDS patients who did not have RS or SF3B1 20 20 20 Real-world evidence of luspatercept Real-world data have consistently confirmed the efficacy and safety of luspatercept. In a large Italian multicenter study of 201 patients with LR-MDS and RS [ 57 58 59 Imetelstat: a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat is a 13-mer oligonucleotide that binds to the RNA template (TERC) of telomerase, thereby inhibiting telomere elongation in malignant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. By accelerating telomere shortening, imetelstat selectively induces apoptosis in clonal cells with high telomerase activity, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. This mechanism targets the replicative immortality of MDS clones, offering a novel approach to address anemia and underlying clonal dynamics [ 60 Clinical evidence The IMerge phase III trial ( NCT02598661 21 SF3B1, TET2 21 21 Potential for disease modification Imetelstat has demonstrated intriguing signals of disease modification, including reduction in the variant allele frequency (VAF) of common mutations, such as SF3B1 TET2 21 23 p 21 Ongoing challenges in the era of multiple anemia-correction agents in LR-MDS The availability of four anemia-correction agents (ESAs, lenalidomide, luspatercept, and imetelstat) has transformed the management of LR-MDS. However, critical challenges persist in optimizing their use. First, although luspatercept and imetelstat have demonstrated efficacy in patients with ESA-refractory LR-MDS (Table 1 19 21 SF3B1 SF3B1 Table 1 Results of pivotal phase 3 trials for luspatercept (MEDALIST) and imetelstat (IMerge) in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-refractory or ineligible patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome Parameters Luspatercept (MEDALIST) Imetelstat (IMerge) Inclusion criteria 2–6 u of RBC TF in 8 weeks ≥ 4 u of RBC TF in 16 weeks (no upper TF limit) Patient’s convenience S.C. injection every 3 weeks 2 h I.V. injection every 4 weeks RBC-TI ≥ 8 weeks 38% (vs. placebo 13%) 40% (vs. placebo 15%) Median duration of response 30.6 weeks 51.6 weeks Hb increase > 1.5 g/dL 3.6 g/dL Safety Probably the safest drug Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (transient and manageable) Potential for disease modification Not likely (erythroid maturation) Maybe (originally developed for anticancer drug) RBC TF RBC-TI S.C. I.V. Hb Second, the optimal sequence or combination of these agents remains unclear (Fig. 1 SF3B1 Fig. 1 Possible sequential approach to anemia-correcting therapy in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes Finally, even among patients who achieve anemia correction, many with LR-MDS ultimately progress to high-risk MDS or acute myeloid leukemia. Imetelstat has shown reductions in the VAF of mutations, such as SF3B1 TET2 Conclusion The introduction of luspatercept and imetelstat has expanded the treatment options for anemia in patients with lower-risk MDS, with luspatercept now established as a first-line standard, and imetelstat offering a valuable alternative for ESA-refractory patients. Both agents show efficacy across diverse clinical subgroups; however, the absence of predictive biomarkers and uncertainty regarding optimal sequencing remain key challenges. Although imetelstat demonstrates the potential for disease modification, further evidence is needed to confirm its long-term effects. In Korea, the lack of local introduction of imetelstat and reimbursement for luspatercept currently limits their clinical use, highlighting a critical area for improvement. Ongoing research should focus on individualized treatment strategies and long-term disease control based on molecular and clinical insights.
