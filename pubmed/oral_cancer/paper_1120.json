This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Simple Summary There is a paucity of information available regarding the oncogenic potential of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on the subungual and plantar surfaces of the skin. Both conditions are frequently misdiagnosed as benign conditions, including the most common condition in each region: warts, specifically known as subungual verrucae or plantar verrucae, depending upon their location in the nail unit or on the sole of the foot, respectively. However, malignancies are recalcitrant to standard treatment for plantar and subungual verrucae. The authors of this review aim to raise the index of suspicion for malignant potential of HPV under these circumstances. Our review of the literature database affords us the opportunity to present herein clinical pearls for dermatologists to reduce the incidence of delayed diagnosis of HPV-induced SCC of the subungual and plantar surfaces, thereby reducing the time to diagnosis of malignancies. In this way, patients will be more likely to avoid more invasive, disfiguring measures and patient health outcomes are more likely to improve. Abstract Background: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nail unit, known as the subungual region, and of the plantar foot is rare but often misdiagnosed due to its similar appearance to verruca, a common wart. The delayed diagnosis and treatment of SCC in the subungual and plantar foot leads to poorer outcomes. Human papillomavirus (HPV), and specifically the oncogenic potential of particular strains, influences SCC pathogenesis, progression, and treatment response. Methods: This review aims to address the current state of knowledge as well as deficits associated with clinical treatment of SCC in two anatomically challenging locations: verrucous carcinoma (VC), a variant of SCC that affects the plantar foot, and subungual SCC. Articles reviewed were evaluated based on date of publication, quality, and originality. Additionally, articles published after 2015 were given preferential consideration. Results: This review highlights considerations to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes when considering two uncommon cutaneous malignancies. Conclusions: We recognize that misdiagnosis poses a barrier in the treatment of both plantar VC and subungual SCC. As such, we identify pertinent clinical pearls to assist in accurate identification and treatment of SCC in these locations. Lastly, we address the role of HPV and the microbiome in the pathogenesis of SCC to improve treatment efficacy. human papillomavirus (HPV) verrucous carcinoma (VC) plantar verrucous carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) verruca plantaris subungual squamous cell carcinoma This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) being the second most common type of skin cancer [ 1 2 1 In this review, we aim to identify, analyze, and discuss the diagnostic difficulties associated with subungual SCC and plantar verrucous carcinoma (VC), both relatively rarer locations for SCC, to increase awareness and reduce diagnostic delays. Furthermore, we will synthesize the scarce available literature and discuss current research regarding the role of HPV in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of subungual SCC and plantar VC. We will describe the oncogenic potential of HPV in SCC of both the subungual region and the plantar foot and assess factors that may render a carcinogenic outcome more likely. We will provide insight into the pathogenesis of HPV and its oncogenic potential, a diagnostic approach to the subtle signs and symptoms of SCC in the subungual region and plantar foot, and suggest a potential treatment plan, which could result in improved morbidity and decreased mortality in these regions in SCCs derived from oncogenic HPV. 2. Methodology This narrative review was conducted using a targeted literature search strategy. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for peer reviewed articles in English that addressed the clinical, pathological, or molecular aspects of subungual SCC and plantar VC. Reference lists of key articles were also screened to identify additional relevant publications. No predefined search terms or Boolean operators were employed, as our approach relied on reference chaining and expert selection of pertinent studies. Inclusion criteria were: (1) peer-reviewed articles in English, and (2) studies providing clinical, pathological, or molecular information on subungual SCC or plantar VC. Exclusion criteria were: (1) case reports without confirmed diagnoses, (2) non-English articles without available translation, and (3) publications lacking original data. 3. Molecular Basis of HPV Driving Oncogenesis Human papillomavirus (HPV) drives oncogenesis primarily through the expression of its E6 and E7 oncogenes. These proteins inactivate the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb, respectively, enabling uncontrolled cell proliferation. E6 also disrupts cellular polarity and adhesion by interacting with PDZ-domain-containing proteins, while E7 promotes viral replication and cellular transformation through interactions with histone deacetylases, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases. Together, these mechanisms transform HPV-infected cells into malignant cells [ 3 4. Subungual SCC Compared to other surfaces of the skin, subungual SCC is a relatively rare malignancy that typically arises between the nail plate and the nail bed [ 4 4 5 The most common presentation of subungual SCC is among men 50–69 years of age with a verrucous growth on the fingernail bed that has been present for years and is refractory to standard wart treatment [ 5 6 7 7 5 7 7 8 4.1. Histopathology of Subungual SCC Histopathologic verification is essential in establishing the diagnosis of subungual SCC, especially due to its ability to mimic benign conditions on clinical exam. Microscopically, subungual SCC follows a similar histological pattern as cutaneous SCC in other anatomical locations [ 9 9 10 9 Recently, research has found subungual SCC to originate from the nail bed and the nail fold, two different epithelia [ 11 11 Comparatively, subungual SCC of the nail bed epithelium has been characterized as having greater differentiation and anteroposterior growth [ 11 11 4.2. Pathogenesis and Association with HPV Infection The etiology of subungual SCC is mutationally heterogeneous and pathogenetically complex; it is hypothesized that a variety of factors influence its emergence, and further research is necessary to elucidate these pathways in greater detail [ 12 4 4 The role of HPV in the pathogenesis of subungual SCC is also relevant. 60% to 80% of subungual SCC cases have been reported to be associated with HPV, most commonly HPV-16 [ 13 14 7 4.3. Risk Factors for HPV-Associated Subungual SCC Risk factors predisposing individuals to HPV-associated subungual SCC include immunosuppression, trauma, self-inoculation from other areas of the body, including genital-digital transmission [ 4 15 16 4 15 14 16 16 14 16 4.4. Diagnosis of Subungual SCC The diagnosis of subungual SCC is confirmed definitively via a biopsy. However, pain and scarring associated with a nail biopsy are a barrier to this definitive diagnosis method and contribute to a delay in treatment often seen in subungual SCC cases [ 4 16 4 14 16 6 4.5. Treatment of Subungual SCC The primary treatment for noninvasive subungual SCC is surgical excision of the tumor, with Mohs surgery being the preferred approach due to its tissue-sparing properties and decreased scarring [ 4 4 4 13 17 4.6. Metastatic Potential and Complications of Subungual SCC Subungual SCC has low metastatic potential, and lymph node involvement has been reported in less than 2% of patients. Subungual SCC is considered less likely to metastasize than SCC located in other anatomical areas [ 18 While the metastatic potential is low, it is not completely null. A case of HPV-associated subungual SCC that metastasized to the axillary lymph node has been reported. There was no bone involvement of the primary subungual SCC and metastasis was identified 40 months after initial treatment of the primary growth with Mohs surgery [ 19 The primary complications associated with subungual SCC are the cosmetic abnormalities and functional deficits associated with the lesion and its treatment, surgical excision. Surgical excision can be a painful process, eliciting a sense of fear among patients as well as resulting in deformation of the nail unit. Patients may be hesitant to opt for a biopsy due to the pain and deformation associated with this diagnostic procedure. Patient hesitancy to biopsy can represent another factor delaying the diagnosis and treatment of subungual SCC. If SCC has invaded bone and amputation is required, functionality of the digit and hand will likely be impaired. This can have negative effects on a patient’s quality of life, including societal stigma and a reduction in occupational ability. The outcome of biopsy and excision on the appearance and functionality of the digit should be discussed with the patient and considered as a complication of subungual SCC. 4.7. Prognosis and Follow-Up for Subungual SCC While subungual SCC has a favorable prognosis if treated early, delayed diagnosis can lead to aggressive disease progression with higher risks of local invasion and metastasis. Subungual SCC has a significant local recurrence rate following excision, and as such, dermatologic follow-up should be advised. A systematic review of recurrence rates by excision type found almost no difference in local recurrence rates following Mohs surgery, wide surgical excision, and amputation [ 20 20 5. Verrucous Carcinoma of the Foot Verrucous carcinoma (VC) of the foot is a rare, well-differentiated, locally invasive, low-grade SCC that has the potential to evolve from an HPV infection. VC typically presents in the oral cavity, but lesions may sometimes form on a patient’s genitals or on the plantar foot. VC appears as a cauliflower-like mass that grows slowly [ 21 Plantar VC is often misdiagnosed as the benign and more common verruca plantaris, also known as a plantar wart. This misdiagnosis may pose a significant obstacle for patients and physicians, and may have detrimental outcomes for the patient [ 22 22 23 Accurate diagnosis by recognizing plantar VC characteristics is of utmost importance, as correct identification leads to appropriate and swift treatment. In one case report, plantar VC presented as recalcitrant verruca plantaris. The patient reported a 20-year history of a slowly growing, ulcerated, and verrucous plaque on the plantar foot that was mistakenly treated as verruca plantaris. For 20 years, physicians and other providers had believed that the growth was benign, when in fact it was a slow-growing malignant tumor [ 23 24 As previously mentioned, plantar VC is commonly misdiagnosed as verruca plantaris. Verruca plantaris, also known as a plantar wart, is a common skin growth located on the plantar foot and is caused by HPV [ 25 26 27 28 29 Current methods used for diagnostic confirmation of HPV involve performing an excisional biopsy and proceeding with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or histopathological studies. Biopsies in this region can be painful and difficult to perform and have a slow healing process [ 30 31 32 The specific strain of HPV present may influence both the clinical progression and prognosis. A randomized controlled trial by Bruggink et al., examined different subgroups of common and plantar verruca, and sought to assess which lesions responded to different treatments based on the HPV strain. The study found evidence to support that cryotherapy and salicylic acid treatment outcomes varied based on different HPV strains. After cryotherapy, 30/44 verruca associated with HPV 2, 27, or 57 were cured, 6/56 verruca associated with HPV 2, 27, or 57-associated verruca plantaris were cured, and 15/23 HPV-1 associated verruca plantaris were cured. A differential trend was also observed after salicylic acid therapy, in which 16/87 HPV 2, 27, or 57-associated verruca were cured, 15/60 HPV 2, 27, or 57-associated verruca plantaris were cured, and 24/26 HPV 1-associated verruca plantaris were cured [ 27 Numerous clinical case reports exist that attempt to hypothesize different risk factors that may determine the risk of oncogenesis and disease prognosis. One case report describes a case of SCC in a patient diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1. The case suggests that there may be an elevated risk of cancer when an HPV infection is compounded with a genetic predisposition in specific patient populations [ 33 34 25 5.1. Histopathology of VC of the Foot Plantar VC closely mimics the clinical presentation of verruca plantaris. However, once biopsied, there are key differences in the histopathology and overall outlook between the two disease states. In a case report by Wasserman et al., magnetic resonance imaging of a skin lesion revealed a plantar ulcer that demonstrated a unique enhancement pattern at the ulcer’s base. The interface between normal skin and the ulcer demonstrated a fine-filamentous pattern of enhancement, similar to cotton wool [ 35 36 37 38 5.2. Pathogenesis and Association with HPV Infection More than 99% of cervical cancers [ 39 40 16 One case report described a case of SCC in-situ, also known as Bowen’s disease, on the plantar foot, which showed high-risk HPV type 16 through PCR analysis. It was also observed that the tumor cells in the surrounding skin tissue showed stains for protein p16INK4a, a tumor suppressor protein. Based on these findings, and another report of HPV 16-associated Bowen’s disease of the foot that also showed strong expression of p16INK4a, it is believed that the dysregulation of the retinoblastoma/p16INK4a pathway is considered to play a vital role in the pathogenesis of Bowen’s disease [ 41 42 43 44 16 45 HPV 16 is not the only strain responsible for the carcinogenic pathogenesis. One case report delineates a case of Bowen’s disease on the plantar foot with HPV type 31 [ 46 47 40 42 The surrounding microenvironment of the foot in the pathogenesis and/or invasiveness of plantar VC might also be relevant. It is increasingly recognized that the local microenvironment of an HPV-infected cervix is an important cofactor in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer due to the ability of these virus-infected cells to reshape local milieu and form an immunosuppressive post-infection microenvironment [ 39 48 5.3. Risk Factors for Plantar VC Risk factors for plantar VC include chronic exposure to irritation, trauma, inflammation, poor local hygiene, and HPV infection, and these factors are also associated with plantar warts [ 49 50 51 52 53 Chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the foot, such as chronic diabetic foot ulcers, burn scars, and lichen sclerosus have also been implicated as risk factors for VC [ 54 55 56 56 56 5.4. Diagnosis of Plantar VC Plantar VC is often challenging to diagnose, due to its benign clinical and histological appearance of well-differentiated cells without presence of cellular dysplasia [ 57 52 58 58 52 5.5. Treatment of Plantar VC The treatment of plantar VC is surgical intervention, including wide local excision (WLE) or Mohs micrographic surgery, with WLE being the most common treatment modality [ 55 23 23 59 59 Extensive destruction of local tissue or bone can require amputation for full removal of VC [ 55 60 23 One case report described the extensive local destruction by VC in a recalcitrant ulcer, which was treated as a benign tumor for years, ultimately requiring amputation of the foot [ 61 62 61 It is ideal to diagnose plantar VC early to prevent invasion into the surrounding tissue. One study suggests that while VC recurrence may occur, complications are less likely if diagnosed early by a high clinical suspicion and with thorough histopathologic analysis [ 63 64 5.6. Metastatic Potential and Other Complications of Plantar VC Due to the slow-growing nature of VC and its verrucous clinical appearance, there is often a low suspicion for malignancy when a patient presents with a verrucous growth [ 57 65 22 23 49 56 66 67 68 One case report described a case of a patient with plantar VC that had been misdiagnosed as common verruca plantaris. Excisions, antibiotic therapy, and topical agents for the treatment of verruca plantaris were noted to induce only limited improvement. Eventually, the lesion was appropriately diagnosed as plantar VC, but by the time the diagnosis was made, CT scan revealed that the tumor had invaded the bone. Therefore, below-the-knee amputation was performed. No postoperative complications were reported or observed, but the patient needed a leg prosthesis. This case further sheds light on the complications of unrecognized VC due to its slow growth and confusing early-stage appearances [ 68 As VC is a locally malignant destructive tumor, any presence of bone involvement through imaging warrants the need for amputation [ 56 69 70 69 70 5.7. Prognosis and Follow-Up for Plantar VC The prognosis of plantar VC is favorable when detected and treated early. It is important to follow up with patients to ensure that the lesions have not recurred or metastasized after surgical intervention. If a diagnosis of VC is made, a full body scan should be conducted to rule out metastatic disease, especially as a diagnosis of VC is often made only after it has been present for a while. Providers are often lax about performing biopsies of verrucous growths because they are common and relatively quick and easy to treat. However, it is imperative to consider plantar VC in the differential diagnosis, especially if the assumed verruca plantaris does not respond appropriately and entirely to treatment. DecisionDx-SCC provides predictive values that indicate an SCC’s risk for nodal or distant metastasis [ 71 72 73 6. Conclusions and Future Directions Subungual SCC and plantar VC are both uncommon, yet serious malignancies that are associated with high-risk HPV infection. Although rare, both subungual SCC and plantar VC are potentially life altering and lethal. Increased awareness of the association between HPV and SCC may result in earlier diagnosis and more a effective treatment plan, ultimately improving patient outcomes. SCC affecting the subungual or plantar foot is often misdiagnosed, resulting in delaysin treatment. Most commonly, subungual SCC is misdiagnosed as a benign condition such as verruca vulgaris, chronic infection such as onychomycosis, or as trauma-related deformities [ 6 Many questions remain unresolved even after a thorough review of the literature. Literature is lacking that assesses the percent of conversion of HPV into SCC. When this conversion occurs, and the factors that promote it during pathogenesis, also is uncertain. Additional research is needed to understand these complex associations in greater detail. Given the established association between high-risk HPV strains and the pathogenesis of both subungual SCC and plantar VC, we recommend that future prospective studies should also investigate the role of prophylactic HPV vaccination as a preventive measure in at-risk populations (e.g., immunosuppressed patients, those with chronic trauma to the nail unit or plantar surfaces). Prophylactic HPV vaccination has been predominantly focused on the prevention of HPV-related anogenital disease. However, a clinical response observed with nonavalent HPV vaccination in an immunosuppressed adult with recalcitrant cutaneous warts suggests the potential immunotherapeutic benefit of vaccination may extend further than previously thought [ 74 Overall, there is a dearth of research and published literature regarding the oncogenic potential of human papillomavirus (HPV) in driving the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in subungual and plantar SCC. Understanding epidemiological factors and accurate diagnosis is essential for improving clinical outcomes and for providing dermatologists with a clearer protocol regarding how to treat patients presenting with cutaneous growths on the plantar foot or subungual region (See Table 1 Table 2 Figure 1 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, methodology, and preparation: E.S.G., R.M., T.H. and G.S.S.; Writing and Editing: R.M., T.H., G.S.S. and E.S.G.; Supervision: E.S.G.

Key Finding per Literature Practical Pearls for Physicians A case report noted that for 20 years, professionals had believed that a patient was experiencing a benign lesion, when in fact it was a slow-growing tumor on the sole of the foot [ 23 Accurate and early diagnosis is critical in administering the appropriate treatment. Medical providers involved in the diagnosis and treatment of skin lesions typically rely heavily on a heuristic, visual diagnosis of clinical skin presentations. However, such reliance may lead to diagnostic error in clinical practice [ 29 Reliance solely on visual assessments may lead to misdiagnosis, especially in cases where skin growths are recalcitrant to standard treatment. Current methods that are used for the diagnostic confirmation of HPV involve performing an excisional biopsy and proceeding with PCRor histopathological studies, which have proven to be invasive, painful, oftentimes difficult to perform, and slow to heal [ 30 A shave or punch biopsy should be the standard of treatment when there is clinical suspicion of subungual SCC or plantar VC. Different strains of HPV respond differently to different treatment plans. Cryotherapy and salicylic acid treatment outcomes presented with differential results based on HPV strain [ 27 Testing for the specific strain of HPV that appears as a verruca may provide insight into best treatment options While metastatic potential is low for both subungual SCC and plantar VC, the risk is not nonexistent: A case report described metastasis of subungual SCC to the axillary lymph node [ 19 Documented areas of metastasis from the plantar foot include the lymph nodes and the lungs [ 49 56 66 Cancer metastasis should be assessed in patients who have either subungual SCC or plantar VC. Risk factors predisposing patients to subungual SCC include immunosuppression, trauma, self-inoculation from other areas of the body, and genital-digital transmission [ 12 15 16 49 50 51 Physicians must pay careful attention to patients presenting with one or more risk factors and assess with a scrutinous approach that potentially involves histological examination and follow up appointments. It is generally appropriate to biopsy any verrucous growth when it is recalcitrant to treatment 1st line treatment: liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, salicylic acid, or imiquimod [ 75 2nd line treatment: Cantharidin, pulsed dye laser therapy, retinoids, intralesional immunotherapy [ 76 3rd line treatment: Gardasil vaccination against HPV, which elicits an immune response for the body to recognize HPV as foreign no matter where it presents [ 17 74 cancers-17-03029-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Comparative Summary Table of Subungual SCC and Plantar VC.  Subungual SCC Plantar VC Incidence Rare, but the most common malignant tumor of the nail unit; often misdiagnosed as benign nail disease, which contributes to underreporting [ 4 Rare; typically arises on weight-bearing plantar surfaces, especially the ball of foot, proximal to the big toe [ 22 Demographics Predominantly affects men aged 50–69; thumb most commonly involved; rare pediatric cases reported [ 5 6 8 Predominantly affects men in their 50s (79–89%); associated with occupational friction; uncommon sites are possible [ 52 56 HPV Strains 60–80% HPV-associated; most frequent subtype HPV-16; others include HPV-18, -35, and -56 [ 7 13 16 Commonly associated with HPV-16, -18, -31, and -45 [ 34 41 42 46 47 Recurrence Recurrence depends on treatment modality: Mohs surgery (≤9%), wide local excision (≤6%), amputation (≤6%), partial excision (up to 50%) [ 20 Recurrence depends on treatment modality: wide local excision (19–75%), Mohs surgery (~16%) [ 59 Metastasis Rare cases documented in the literature, less than 2% of cases have lymph node involvement [ 18 Rare cases documented in the literature: 3 cases involving lymph nodes and one case involving lungs reported [ 49 56 66 Treatment Non-invasive: Mohs surgery preferred [ 4 4 4 4 Wide local excision or Mohs micrographic surgery [ 23 55 55 ",
