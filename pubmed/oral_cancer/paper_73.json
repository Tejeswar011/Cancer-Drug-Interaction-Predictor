Probiotics introduce beneficial bacteria to the skin, thereby enhancing its integrity and boosting natural defenses. Prebiotics, in turn, feed these beneficial microorganisms, supporting a balanced microbiome that promotes overall skin health 18 2 Microbiome balance became particularly important during the coronavirus pandemic, where the requirement to wash and disinfect hands was one of the crucial elements of the sanitary regime, resulting in nondiscriminatory removal of pathogens and other skin microbes. This resulted in the increased recognition of topically applied probiotics to address this newly emerged need 19 20 21 23 The use of probiotics in topical preparations can replenish skin microbiome affected by inflammation, in conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, and improve dry or sensitive skin 24 To create a formulation containing live probiotic bacteria, a carrier must be used to enclose microorganisms. Selecting the right coating material is crucial for the stability of the obtained particles. This carrier can be alginate–tapioca microspheres, which are not only biocompatible but also biodegradable and non-toxic systems to deliver active substances 25 26 27 Therefore, the aim of the study was to test the antimicrobial activity of L. casei Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus aureus Materials and methods Materials The study used microorganism strains obtained from the following three centers: The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ), and the Polish Collection of Microorganisms (PCM). The strains included: A probiotic strain — Lactobacillus casei Staphylococcus epidermidis Micrococcus luteus Staphylococcus capitis subsp. urealyticus Staphylococcus hominis Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Candida albicans Cryptococcus neoformans L. casei Effect of L. casei on S. aureus and S. epidermidis The activity of metabolites of the probiotic strain L. casei S. aureus S. epidermidis Time-kill test Time-kill assay was conducted according to Prabhurajeshwar and Chandrakanth 28 29 S. aureus S. epidermidis L.casei L. casei S. aureus S. epidermidis 8 −1 L. casei S. aureus S. epidermidis Well diffusion assay L. casei S. aureus S. epidermidis 28 L. casei 30 S. aureus, S. epidemidis 6 7 S. aureus S. epidermidis L. casei The diameter of the growth inhibition zone was assessed after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C.

The cells were cultured in DMEM (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin (Thermo Scientific), and 100 ug/ml streptomycin (Thermo Scientific) at 37 °C/5% CO 2 Cell viability assay A day prior to the experiment HaCaT and HSF cells were seeded into 96-well plates (50,000 and 30,000 cells/well, respectively). On the day of the experiment respective dilutions of formulation in DMEM were applied into the cell-containing wells and plate was incubated for 24 h under 37 °C/5% CO 2 2 Proliferation A day before the experiment HaCaT and HSF cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5,000 cells/well or 10,000 cells/well, respectively. On the day of the experiment respective dilutions of formulation in DMEM with 2% FBS were applied on the cells. After 48 h samples were analyzed similarly as for the viability assay described above, with HaCaT and HSF incubated with thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 20 min and 1 h, respectively. Absorbance of the 100% isopropanol/5 mM HCl-dissolved formazan crystals was measured at 570 nm in a new, transparent 96-well plate using Hidex Sense microplate reader (Hidex). Results were compared to DMEM-only treated control and increase/decrease in absorbance was interpreted as enhancement or decrease of cell number, respectively. Effect of formulation on cytokine release To prepare the cell-conditioned media, cells were seeded into the 48-well plates a day prior to the experiment (at a density of 100,000 cells per well (HaCaT ) and 50,000 cells per well (HSF cells). After overnight incubation at 37 °C/5% CO 2 ELISA The levels of IL-6 and IL-8 released into the cell culture media were measured using commercial ELISA kits (R&D) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, a half-area, high binding, 96-well plates (Greiner) were coated with appropriate coating antibodies diluted (1:120) in PBS and left overnight at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C). Following day, wells were washed with washing buffer (0.05% Tween in PBS) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C) with 150 µl of 1% BSA diluted in PBS. Again, the wells were washed and 50 µl of samples were added to the individual wells and incubated further at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C) for 2 h. Subsequently wells were again washed and incubated with biotin-conjugated primary antibodies (1:60) for 2 h. Upon penultimate wash, the wells were incubated with streptavidin-HRP (1:40) for 30 min and finally washed again (5x) and developed. TMB substrate solution (50 µl of TMB substrate reagent set, BD) was added to each well and incubated for up to 5 min, before the reaction was stopped with 25 µl of 2N H 2 4 Scratch assay For the wound healing assay, inserts (Ibidi) were placed in a 12-well plate, prior to HaCaT cells (600,000 cells/well) being seeded around and in the chambers of insert in DMEM containing 10% FBS.

Additionally, the average droplet size and emulsion pH were evaluated, followed by rheological analysis. The physicochemical properties of the base formulation—E1 and the formulation containing probiotic microspheres—E2 are listed in Table 3 L. casei Table 3 Physicochemical properties and viability of probiotics in prepared emulsions.

In vitro studies To examine the cytotoxicity of the prepared topical formulations, cellular models having two skin cells types—keratinocytes and fibroblasts—were implemented. Immortalized normal human keratinocyte-like (HaCaT) (Fig. 3 4 Fig. 3 HaCaT cell viability test (MTT) in the ( A B Fig. 4 HSF cell viability test (MTT) in the ( A B Results indicate no negative effect of the formulation on HaCaT cell viability up to a concentration of 2.5%. The 5% concentration resulted in a ~ 25% decrease in cell viability (IC25%), and an IC50% was achieved at concentrations of approximately 10% for both formulations. It should be noted that the base formulation and probiotic microsphere-containing emulsion exhibited similar effects, indicating no negative effect of microspheres on cell viability. No negative effect of the formulation on fibroblasts was observed up to a concentration of 5%, and IC50% was achieved at approximately 10% concentration for both formulations. Moreover, for 1.25–5% concentrations, an increase in HSF cells viability was observed. The effect of both formulations on HaCaT (Fig. 5 6 Fig. 5 Effect on the proliferation of HaCaT cells (MTT) in the ( A B Fig. 6 Effect of ( A B HaCaT cells stimulated with formulation concentrations above 0.08–0.16% (Fig. 5 A similar relationship was observed in HSF cells. Here, a slight induction in proliferation was observed up to 0.08% of the basic formulation and up to 0.16% of the formulation containing encapsulated probiotic microspheres. Human fibroblast proliferation was inhibited at higher concentrations, as basic formulation above 0.16% and probiotic formulation above 0.31% reduced the observed cell viability. The formulation containing encapsulated probiotic microspheres was intended for topical application. Thus, the encapsulated ingredient was intended to affect the outer layer of the epidermis, lacking proliferating cells, while retaining the positive effect of the formulation on the skin microbiome. Formulation concentrations that were considered non-cytotoxic were selected for further in vitro testing, including cytokine release profile as measured by ELISA and wound healing effect. Both formulations stimulated the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in HaCaT and HSF cells (Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Cytokine production in ( A B In HaCaT-conditioned media treated with 0.5% formulation, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were ~ 50% higher than in unstimulated cells. In case of fibroblast cells stimulation with formulations resulted in less than 40% increase in IL-6 release similar for both empty formulation and one containing microspheres. Moreover, IL-8 levels increased but stimulation with formulation containing encapsulated probiotic microspheres had a less pronounced effect compared to the base formulation, suggesting anti-inflammatory effect of L. casei Although the formulations are ultimately intended for use on healthy, intact skin, we decided to exclude any potential negative effects on the regeneration of micro-injuries within the superficial skin layer, specifically involving the keratinocyte layer. Base formulation and formulation containing encapsulated probiotic microspheres exhibited regenerative properties in wound healing assay (Fig. 8 Fig. 8 ( A B C D E F G As shown in Fig. 8 Effect of topical formulation containing L. casei on skin microbiome The impact of the formulation containing encapsulated L. casei 4 Table 4 Assessment of the impact of a topical formulation on reference microorganisms occurring in the natural microbiome of human skin.
