Pigmented rice is widely popular because of its abundant phytochemicals and various health benefits. This study investigated the variations in the carotenoids and flavonoids of Yangxian-pigmented rice (black, green, purple, yellow, and red) through LC‒MS/MS targeted metabolomics. A total of 20 carotenoids were identified, with 18 xanthophylls (90 %) and 2 carotenes (10 %). Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that PC1 and PC2 accounted for 55.4 % and 26.4 %, respectively, of the variance among pigmented rice samples. PLS-DA revealed 5 significantly different carotenoids (VIP >1 and P value < 0.05) across these rice varieties. Additionally, 378 metabolites, consisting of 361 flavonoids (95.5 %) and 17 tannic acids (4.5 %), were detected. PCA revealed that PC1 and PC2 contributed 52.5 % and 24.8 % of the variance, respectively, and PLS-DA identified 147 significantly differential flavonoids (VIP >1 and P < 0.05) among the samples. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed variation within the groups and separation among the groups, suggesting relatively significant differences in carotenoids and flavonoids among pigmented rice. KEGG pathway analysis mapped 5 carotenoid metabolites to three metabolic pathways (carotenoid biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis) and 22 flavonoid metabolites to five pathways (secondary metabolite biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, flavonoid biosynthesis, flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis, and anthocyanin biosynthesis). These findings can support research on bioactive compounds and functional food processing in pigmented rice.

(2023a) Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC‒MS) is an advanced analytical technique that separates analytes and detects them on the basis of their mass, offering high sensitivity and a wide detection range ( De Vos et al., 2007 Chen et al., 2013 Yang et al., 2024 Mughal et al. (2025) Younis et al., 2022 Saini et al., 2022 As carotenoids and flavonoids are vital phytochemicals in pigmented rice, it is possible to characterize them through targeted metabolomics. To increase the added value of Yangxian-pigmented rice, our previous studies performed quantitative analysis of anthocyanin ( Han et al., 2021 Zheng et al., 2020 Jin et al., 2022 2023 Cheng et al., 2025 In this study, carotenoids and flavonoids in Yangxian-pigmented rice varieties were characterized via LC‒MS/MS targeted metabolomics. Furthermore, differentially abundant metabolite and KEGG pathway analyses have also been implemented to describe differences in carotenoids and flavonoids in various colored rice varieties ( Gao et al., 2013 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials and reagents The five pigmented rice samples were purchased from Zhoudahei Food Co., Ltd. (Hanzhong, China) in February 2025, and the milling procedure was performed according to Ye et al. (2024) Fig. 1 Jin et al., 2023 Cheng et al., 2025 Fig. 1 (A) Photographs displaying Yangxian-colored rice. (B) Histogram of carotenoid levels in different pigmented rice samples. (C) Classification of 378 metabolites. (D) Pie-class plot of overall flavonoids in different pigmented rice samples. Fig. 1 Acetonitrile (ACN), ethanol (EtOH), and methanol (MeOH) of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Sinopharm supplied the acetone, and Aladdin supplied the butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). CNW and Rhawn provided sodium chloride (NaCl) and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), respectively. The source of potassium hydroxide (KOH) was Hushi. Milli-Q water (Millipore, Bradford, USA) was used throughout every experiment. The standards were procured from Sigma‒Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and BOC (NY, USA), with formic acid also sourced from Sigma‒Aldrich. The standard stock solutions were mixed with MTBE and MeOH (1 mg/mL) and stored at −20 °C. 2.2 Targeted metabolomics analysis of carotenoids 2.2.1 Sample preparation and extraction A modified procedure from Zheng et al. (2022) n v/v/v 2.2.2 UPLC parameters A UPLC-APCI-MS/MS system (UPLC, ExionLCTM AD, https://sciex.com.cn/ https://sciex.com.cn v/v 2.2.3 APCI-MS/MS conditions A QTRAP® 6500+ LC‒MS/MS system with an APCI Heated Nebulizer was used for the analyses. Both linear ion trap (LIT) and triple quadrupole (QQQ) designs were used for positive ion mode scans. Software called Analyst 1.6.3 was in charge of the system. The ion source was in APCI + mode at 350 °C, and the curtain gas (CUR) pressure was 25.0 psi. These were the APCI source characteristics. The predetermined multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was employed to assess carotenoids, and Analyst 1.6.3 software was used to gather the data. Multiquant 3.0.3 software (Sciex) was used to quantify each metabolite. For every MRM transition, the mass spectrometer parameters, including the collision energy (CE) and declustering potential (DP), were tuned. Specific MRM transitions were monitored for each period, corresponding to the metabolites eluted during that time frame. 2.3 Targeted metabolomics assay of flavonoids 2.3.1 Flavonoid extraction procedure Flavonoid extraction was performed with slight modifications to the approach described by Kim et al. (2010) 2.3.2 UPLC conditions On the basis of the following analysis criteria: UPLC chromatographic column, Agilent SB-C18 (1.8 μm, 2.1 mm ∗ 100 mm), the sample extracts were analyzed through a UPLC‒ESI‒MS‒MS‒MS system (UPLC, ExionLC™ AD, https://sciex.com.cn/ https://sciex.com.cn/ 2.3.3 ESI-Q trap-MS/MS The ESI source was run with the following settings: 500 °C for the source temperature; 5500 V for the positive ion mode; and −4500 V for the negative ion mode. Curtain gas (CUR) and ion source gases I (GSI) and II (GSII) were set at 50, 60, and 25 psi, respectively. It was set to high collision activation dissociation (CAD). While the collision gas (nitrogen) was adjusted to medium, triple quadrupole (QQQ) scans were acquired in MRM experiments. For every MRM transition, the collision energy (CE) and declustering potential (DP) were optimized separately. At each interval, a particular set of MRM channels that correspond to the metabolites that were eluted at that moment should be considered. 2.4 Statistical analyses The means ± standard deviations (SDs) of three separate runs were used to express all of the data. The significance analysis (Tukey's test) and correlation analysis were conducted via the SPSS 27.0 software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The relative proportions of various metabolites were estimated via the peak volume normalization method, and Origin 2021 provided a picture of the linked histogram. Using SIMCA 14.1, chemometric statistics and analysis were performed. Cluster analysis and heatmapping were performed via MetaboAnalyst 6.0 (MetaboAnalyst, Qu'ebec, Canada) software to visualize the clustering of multivariate data. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Carotenoids and flavonoids in five different pigmented rice varieties Certain pigmented rice varieties contain phytochemicals that determine their distinctive coloration. These natural pigments can typically be classified into several major categories, including chlorophylls, carotenoids, and flavonoids ( Kim et al., 2010 Fig. S1 and S2 Fig. S3 A total of 20 carotenoids were identified in the Yangxian pigmented rice varieties ( Table 1 Fig. 1 Nakano and Wiegertjes (2020) Lamberts and Delcour (2008) Fratianni et al.

(2010) Zhang et al., 2023b Melini & Acquistucci. (2017) Chen et al., 2022 Feeney et al., 2017 Ahn and Kim, 2021 Among the red-colored rice cultivars, α-carotene had the highest carotenoid content, with values of up to 1.556 μg/g. Nagarajan et al. (2017) Radix et al. (2014) Melini & Acquistucci. (2017) Radix et al. (2014) Nagarajan et al., 2017 In purple-colored rice cultivars, lutein, α-carotene, and 5,6-epoxy-lutein-caprate-palmitate were the major carotenoids, and their contents were slightly lower than those in black rice. Among them, the concentration of lutein was the highest (1.731 μg/g), and these findings are in accordance with the results of Pereira-Caro et al. (2013) Samyor et al. (2017) In yellow-colored rice cultivars, α-carotene was the predominant carotenoid, with the maximum concentration reaching 2.313 μg/g, which may be associated with the yellow coloration of the grains ( Lamberts and Delcour, 2008 Zhu et al. (2022) Among the green-colored rice cultivars, the carotenoid with the highest content was α-carotene (2.530 μg/g). As a naturally occurring carotenoid pigment, α-carotene has a markedly greater antioxidant capacity than β-carotene does and contributes to enhancing immunity and preventing age-related ocular degeneration ( Ku et al., 2019 Yang et al., 2012 Overall, there are 16 kinds of carotenoids in black cultivars, including 14 xanthophylls and 2 carotenes. The red species contains 12 kinds of carotenoids, including 11 xanthophylls and 1 carotene. The identified types of carotenoids in purple-colored rice are similar to those in black-colored rice ( Samyor et al., 2017 Table 1 Petroni et al., 2017 Kim et al., 2010 Melini and Acquistucci (2017) Kim et al. (2010) Del Rio et al., 2013 Fig. 1 Goufo and Trindade, 2014 P Fig. 1 Yu et al. (2021) Fig. 3 Zhang et al. (2023a) Del Rio et al., 2013 Fig. 3 Zheng et al. (2022) Zhang et al., 2023c Ghasemzadeh et al. (2018) Fig. 3 Cheng et al. (2025) Fig. 3 Liang et al. (2023) Zheng et al., 2022 3.2 Multivariate statistical analysis of carotenoids and flavonoids in colored rice Multivariate statistical analysis of five pigmented rice samples was carried out to determine the differences in their metabolites. PCA, PLS-DA, and clustering models were used to investigate the metabolite profiles of pigmented and nonpigmented rice ( Zhang et al., 2023b Jin et al., 2023 In this study, PCA was also used to analyze the detected metabolites and assess the general differences among the samples. PCA can reflect the degree of overall metabolic differences among groups and the extent of variation within group samples. To explore the metabolic variations among pigmented rice cultivars, the 20 kinds of carotenoids detected were studied through principal component analysis (PCA), with PC1 accounting for 55.4 % of the variance and PC2 accounting for 26.4 %, together totaling 81.8 %. These findings indicate that the two principal components revealed key characteristics of the rice grain samples ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Frei and Becker, 2004 Chettry et al., 2019 Fig. 2 Table 1 Kim et al., 2010 Chettry et al., 2019 Kim et al.

Fig. 3 Given that VIP >1.0 and a significance level of P Fig. 2 Zhu et al. (2024) With respect to the flavonoid metabolites in pigmented rice, significant variations were observed among the different varieties.

Fig. 6 According to the PLS-DA model, differential flavonoid metabolites between groups were identified via the following criteria: VIP ≥1 and fold change (FC) ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5 ( Wang et al., 2023 Fig. 4 Wan et al., 2024 Zhu et al., 2024 Zhang et al. (2023a) 3.3 KEGG and enrichment analysis of metabolites with significant differences in carotenoid and flavonoid contents KEGG, as a principal database related to public pathways, was used to process information and identify the metabolic pathways relevant to the significantly enriched compounds. It involves systematic analysis of internal cellular metabolic pathways, which aids in the study of complex biological behaviors and their different metabolites ( Gao et al., 2013 Fig. 6 Kim et al. (2021) Fig. 6 Zhang et al., 2023b Chettry and Chrungoo, 2020 Ruiz-Sola and Rodriguez-Concepcion, 2012 Zhang et al., 2023b Moreover, 378 metabolites were analyzed and detected in this study, of which 55 metabolites could be annotated by KEGG into 6 existing pathways in the database: secondary metabolite synthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis, isoflavone biosynthesis, and anthocyanin biosynthesis. In addition, 22 of 147 differentially abundant flavonoids in the comparison of the five colored rice varieties could be annotated to the five metabolic pathways of the existing KEGG database, including secondary metabolite biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, flavonoid biosynthesis, flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis, and anthocyanin biosynthesis. These findings suggest that there are various metabolite profiles among the five colored rice varieties and that these differences may be associated with grain color. This finding is in agreement with the results of Zhang et al. (2023a) Fig. 6 P Wan et al., 2024 Mackon et al., 2021 Koes et al., 2005 Dai et al., 2012 Goufo and Trindade, 2014 Mackon et al., 2021 Yu et al., 2021 4 Conclusions In summary, Yangxian-colored rice contains 20 carotenoids, with xanthophylls, lutein, and α-carotene being the predominant carotenoids. Five carotenoids (violaxanthin-myristate-caprate, zeaxanthin, α-carotene, violaxanthin myristate, and lutein oleate) significantly promoted the classification of five pigmented rice varieties on the basis of multivariate statistical analysis. Black rice contains more lutein, 5,6 epoxide-lutein-caprate-palmitate, α-carotene and violaxanthin myristate. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that these differential carotenoids are related to carotenoid biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In addition, 378 metabolites, including 361 flavonoids and 17 tannic acids, were identified in Yangxian-colored rice. A total of 147 significantly different flavonoids were screened. The black-colored and purple-colored rice varieties presented greater similarity. The 22 significantly different flavonoids were found to be correlated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, flavonoid biosynthesis, flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis, and anthocyanin biosynthesis via KEGG enrichment analysis. Among these pathways, anthocyanin biosynthesis, which is orchestrated by the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, significantly differed (P < 0.05). The cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-(2″-O-glucosyl)glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, and peonidin-3-O-glucoside with the greatest differences in abundance were associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis. These results provide reference information for understanding the variations in carotenoids and flavonoids among pigmented rice varieties in the future.
