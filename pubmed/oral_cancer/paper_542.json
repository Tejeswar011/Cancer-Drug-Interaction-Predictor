Premature ventricular complex (PVC) constitutes the most prevalent arrhythmia in pregnancy. Because of the potentially adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, managing symptomatic high-burden PVC in pregnancy is challenging; thus, selecting the optimal treatment is crucial. Conventionally, PVC has been managed with beta blockers. However, beta blockers may have negative consequences on the developing fetus. PVC ablation can be performed in patients without fluoroscopy using three-dimensional electroanatomical technology. We present a clinical case series of 6 high-burden pregnant patients who underwent single catheter PVC ablation with zero fluoroscopy during the second trimester of pregnancy. The right ventricular outflow tract was the site of origin of the PVC, which was effectively ablated. All patients were able to continue the pregnancy and delivered at full term. Managing pregnant patients with high-burden PVC is challenging as this population is underrepresented in clinical trials. This case series details the successful management of PVC in pregnancy.

The most prevalent arrhythmia during pregnancy is premature ventricular complex (PVC), which results from the physiological adaptation in pregnancy. In this unique demographic, treatment is always a challenge because PVC or antiarrhythmic medications may have negative effects on both the mother and the fetus. In a study by Chou et al, 1 1 Method of Using Zero Fluoroscopy PVC Ablation Each patient's clinical information was reviewed and discussed during a multidisciplinary meeting between the cardiology and obstetric teams before zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation was planned. A detailed assessment was then conducted, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and 24-hour Holter monitoring for the mother. Fetal assessment was also performed. Before embarking on this procedure, beta blockers were administered as the first line of treatment, and the patients were reassessed during second trimester for symptoms and PVC burden based on 12-lead ECG. Patients not responding to medical therapy were offered zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation. The 6 patients in our case series underwent zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation after failed medical therapy. Another important indication for zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation was that the suspected site of origin of PVC was the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) based on surface 12-lead ECG ( Figure 1 Figure 2 2 Figure 1 Surface Electrocardiogram Showing Sinus Rhythm With Ventricular Bigeminy Left bundle branch block morphology at V1, positive deflections at leads II, III, and AVF with transition at V4 suggestive of posteroseptal right ventricle outflow tract origin.

Clinical examination was unremarkable. The ECG demonstrated sinus rhythm with left bundle branch PVC morphology at V 1 4 Figure 1 Patient 2 A 30-year-old woman, at, 23 weeks gestation in her second pregnancy, presented with recurrent palpitations that had been occurring since early pregnancy. She was diagnosed with PVC in early pregnancy and was given oral propranolol, but her symptoms persisted despite the medication. Clinical examination was unremarkable. ECG revealed sinus rhythm with left bundle branch PVC morphology at V 1 4 Patient 3 A 35-year-old woman at 18 weeks of gestation presented with reduced effort tolerance that she had been experiencing since early pregnancy. She had underlying high-burden RVOT PVC, for which she had previously refused intervention. NYHA functional class I-II was assigned. Her clinical examination was unremarkable. ECG revealed sinus rhythm with frequent PVC; echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60% with no other abnormalities. She underwent zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation at the subvalvular posteroseptal RVOT region. Afterward, her symptoms improved remarkably. The pregnancy was carried until term, and the infant was delivered via normal vaginal delivery at 39 weeks. Patient 4 A 34-year-old woman with underlying high-burden PVC was initially planned for PVC ablation, but she was found to be 10 weeks pregnant. She was otherwise asymptomatic, and the clinical examination was unremarkable. ECG showed sinus rhythm with frequent PVC. Echocardiography showed an LVEF of 20% to 25% with global hypokinesia and a dilated left ventricular chamber. Owing to the impaired LVEF, PVC ablation was advised despite the patient being asymptomatic and without assessing the PVC burden on 24-hour Holter monitoring. Zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation was performed over the anteroseptal RVOT, and the PVC was successfully terminated. On follow-up, LVEF improved to 55%, and she delivered a term infant at 39 weeks via normal vaginal delivery. Patient 5 A 21-year-old primigravida at 23 weeks of pregnancy presented with palpitations, which she began experiencing since the beginning of the second trimester. The patient experienced shortness of breath; NYHA functional class II was assigned. Clinical examination was unremarkable. ECG demonstrated a sinus rhythm with frequent PVC. Echocardiography showed an LVEF of 60% with no other abnormalities. She underwent zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation at the posteroseptal subvalvular RVOT. The remainder of her pregnancy was unremarkable, and she delivered a term infant at 40 weeks via normal vaginal delivery. Patient 6 A 27-year-old woman in her second pregnancy presented with recurrent presyncope at the beginning of the second trimester. Presyncope was associated with palpitations and worsened on exertion. ECG demonstrated a sinus rhythm with frequent PVC. She underwent zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation over the anteroseptal RVOT. She delivered her infant at 38 weeks via elective cesarean section owing to a previous scar. Discussion This case series describes 6 pregnant patients with high-burden PVC who underwent zero fluoroscopy with single-catheter PVC ablation.

Additionally, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs in pregnancy carries a risk of fetal exposure and teratogenicity as these medications may cross the placenta. 1 4 5 The symptoms of palpitation, dyspnea, and presyncope are known to have a poor correlation with documented arrhythmia in nonpregnant patients. This is even more evident during pregnancy, in which pregnancy-related symptoms often overlap. Given the potential risk of continued pregnancy with high burden PVC and medication adverse effects on the fetus, we chose to perform zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation in these highly selected mothers. The mechanism of PVC involves early ventricular activation that spreads in all directions. This can happen due to automaticity, triggered activity, or microreentry. 6 In our case series, all the PVCs originated from the RVOT based on the surface ECG. It is characterized by with a left bundle branch block, which exhibits negative QRS morphology in V 1 In pregnancy, however, physiological adaptations occur in the cardiovascular system to accommodate higher metabolic demand. One study showed that average pulmonary artery dilation in pregnancy was 2 mm, especially in the second and third trimesters, possibly involving the RVOT. 7 Catheter ablation has limited indications in pregnant patients because of concern of x-ray exposure during the electrophysiology procedure. In radiation exposure, there are 2 main biological effects: the deterministic effect (a tissue reaction) and the stochastic effect (carcinogenicity). 8 8 8 Performing zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation in pregnancy enabled these patients to continue their pregnancy until term without any adverse complications affecting the mother and fetus development. A recent systematic review comparing catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drug therapy revealed a lower rate of adverse events in catheter ablation (0%-5.6% vs 9.5%-21%). 9 Zero fluoroscopy radiofrequency ablation has been shown to be effective in pregnant patients. Chen et al 9 10 Conclusions Cardiovascular adaptations in pregnancy are well recognized and important in fetal development. However, approximately 1.68% of pregnant women with structurally normal hearts develop high-burden PVC owing to these adaptations, which is associated with 11.65% of adverse events to both the mother and the fetus. In our case series, zero fluoroscopy PVC ablation in pregnancy was shown to be safe for both the mother and the fetus. PVC ablation during pregnancy also will help the woman to endure the pregnancy without beta blocker usage, which potentially can affect the fetus.
