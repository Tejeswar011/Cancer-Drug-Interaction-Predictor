Materials and Methods The study was carried out at the Microbiological Laboratory of Silesia LabMed, within the Department and Division of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medical Sciences in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice. 2.1. Reference Microbial Strains Standardized microbial reference strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The fungal panel included C. albicans C. glabrata C. krusei Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus 8 2.2. Photosensitizer and Laser TBO, the photosensitizing agent employed in this study, was used in the form of FotoSan Agent (CMS Dental, Roslev, Denmark), a clinically applicable gel formulation with a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL (0.01%). It was provided in pre-dosed, single-use 1.2 mL syringes, designed for immediate clinical use without further preparation. Illumination was delivered using a SmartmPro diode laser (Lasotronix, Piaseczno, Poland), emitting light at a wavelength of 635 nm and operating in continuous wave (CW) mode. The laser applicator featured an 8 mm diameter tip, covering an area of approximately 0.5 cm 2 2 2.3. First Phase of the Study The First phase of the study included an assessment of the Impact of Optimal TBO Incubation Time in Experimental Groups on the Reduction in Viable Microbial Cells under Constant Laser Parameters. A total of 384 tests were conducted (96 for each tested microorganism), divided into four experimental groups: (L+P+) aPDT group (suspension subjected to both the photosensitizer and laser light) (n = 4). (L−P+) photosensitizer-only group (suspension exposed to PS without laser irradiation) (n = 4). (L+P−) light-only group (suspension exposed to laser light without PS) (n = 4). (L−P−) control group (suspension without exposure to either laser light or PS) (n = 4). To assess the impact of incubation time on antimicrobial efficacy, TBO pre-irradiation periods of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min were tested. Laser parameters were kept constant (400 mW, 60 s) to isolate the effect of incubation, with outcomes measured as CFU/mL. Assays were performed in sterile black 96-well microtiter plates with lids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), using 200 µL microbial suspension per well. To prevent cross-light contamination, only 24 non-adjacent wells were used per plate. Wells in the (L+P+) and (L−P+) groups received 50 µL TBO, while (L+P−) and (L−P−) groups received 50 µL tryptone water. Plates were agitated for 1 min at 350 rpm, 35 °C using a PST-60 HL-4 thermoshaker (Biosan, Riga, Latvia). After incubation, irradiation was carried out under darkroom conditions in a Class II laminar flow hood (BIO ACTIVA VE 120, AQUARIA SRL, Lacchiarella, Italy), with the laser tip fixed 1 mm above sample surfaces; adjacent wells were shielded with matte black covers. Post-irradiation, 10 µL from each well was diluted in 4 mL tryptone water, vortexed, and 10 µL aliquots were plated in duplicate on Sabouraud agar ( Candida S. aureus Candida S. aureus 2.4. Second Phase of the Study A total of 1280 tests were conducted (320 for each tested microorganism), divided into four experimental groups outlined in Section 2.3 In this phase, the effect of different laser settings (output power and irradiation time) was evaluated at the optimal TBO incubation time previously established for each microorganism. The outcome was expressed as a reduction in viable cells (CFU/mL). Sterile black 96-well microtiter plates with lids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used, each well containing 200 µL of microbial suspension. To avoid cross-light diffusion, only 24 non-adjacent wells were used per plate. Wells in the (L+P+) and (L−P+) groups received 50 µL of TBO, while (L+P−) and (L−P−) wells received 50 µL of tryptone water. Plates were shaken in a PST-60 HL-4 thermoshaker (Biosan, Riga, Latvia) for 1 min at 350 rpm and 35 °C, then irradiated in a Class II laminar flow hood (BIO ACTIVA VE 120, AQUARIA SRL, Lacchiarella, Italy) under dark conditions at room temperature. In the (L+P+) and (L+P−) groups, irradiation was performed after the assigned incubation period, with the laser tip fixed 1 mm above the well surface. Adjacent wells were shielded with matte black covers. Following irradiation, 10 µL from each well was diluted in 4 mL tryptone water, mixed, and 10 µL aliquots were plated in duplicate on Sabouraud agar ( Candida S. aureus Candida S. aureus 2.5. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica software, version 13.3 (StatSoft, Kraków, Poland). The initial phase in the statistical analysis was to establish the normal distribution of the data by means of the Shapiro–Wilk test. Subsequently, the Levene test was employed to ascertain the homogeneity of variances. The NIR test (Least Significant Difference [LSD] post hoc test) was deployed for comparative analyses between the study groups following ANOVA. Statistical significance was accepted at the p 3. Results 3.1. Phase I-Effect of Incubation Time Incubation time with TBO significantly influenced the antimicrobial effect of aPDT across all tested microorganisms ( Figure S1 S. aureus p Candida C. albicans p C. krusei p C. glabrata p S. aureus C. albicans p S. aureus Candida 3.2. Phase 2-Effect of Laser Parameters The efficacy of aPDT increased with higher power and longer irradiation times ( Table 1 S. aureus C. albicans C. krusei C. glabrata p S. aureus C. albicans p C. albicans C. glabrata S. aureus C. glabrata In Phase II, we evaluated the effect of laser parameters (irradiation time, output power) while keeping TBO incubation constant. aPDT efficacy varied with laser settings, underscoring the need for parameter optimization to ensure therapeutic effectiveness and safety. S. aureus C. albicans C. albicans C. glabrata No significant reductions were observed in control groups (L−P−, L+P−, L−P+). In the treatment group (L+P+), aPDT was most effective at higher power and longer exposure, with reductions exceeding 98% for S. aureus C. albicans C. krusei C. glabrata p S. aureus C. albicans C. krusei p p S. aureus 3.3. Key Findings Minimal effective incubation times: 5 min for S. aureus Candida Most effective tested laser settings: 400 mW for 120 s, though these represent the upper limits of the tested range rather than confirmed optima. Relative susceptibility: S. aureus C. albicans C. krusei C. glabrata. Controls: Neither photosensitizer nor laser alone significantly reduced microbial counts. Levels of statistical significance were graphically presented in the figures. It should be noted, however, that the laser device used in this study had a maximum output of 400 mW, and while irradiation time could be extended beyond 120 s, this was not explored here. This represents a limitation of the present work. 4. Discussion 4.1. Importance of Incubation Time Optimization of incubation time with TBO before light exposure is a critical determinant of aPDT effectiveness. The incubation period directly governs the penetration of the photosensitizer into microbial cells, its subcellular distribution, and the subsequent generation of ROS upon light activation. In our study, a statistically significant reduction in microbial viability was consistently observed after at least 10 min of TBO incubation for Candida Staphylococcus aureus 4.2. Comparison with Previous Studies on Incubation Time Our findings broadly align with previous research, though differences in reported incubation requirements emphasize the complexity of standardizing protocols. Wiench et al. evaluated TBO-mediated aPDT under fixed laser parameters (P = 400 mW, t = 30 s) and concluded that 10 min was most effective for C. albicans 20 C. krusei C. glabrata C. parapsilosis 20 C. albicans 2 29 C. albicans 2 30 C. albicans 31 C. albicans C. tropicalis p 32 4.3. Broader Context of Incubation Parameters Other studies illustrate the variability of incubation requirements across microbial species and experimental models. Nielsen et al. compared riboflavin and TBO as photosensitizers for aPDT against diverse microorganisms, including C. albicans Enterococcus faecalis Escherichia coli Lactobacillus paracasei Porphyromonas gingivalis Prevotella intermedia Cutibacterium acnes 2 p P. intermediaand P. gingivalis 33 S. aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 S. aureus P. aeruginosa P. aeruginosa S. aureus 34 35 36 37 38 39 4.4. Influence of Laser Parameters The second major determinant of aPDT efficacy is the light source. Our results demonstrated a clear dose–response relationship, with stronger reductions achieved at higher power outputs and longer irradiation times. The most pronounced antimicrobial effects were obtained with 400 mW for 120 s, corresponding to the highest tested fluence (48 J/cm 2 S. aureus C. albicans C. krusei C. glabrata 4.5.

Clinical Implications The rising global threat of antimicrobial resistance necessitates exploration of nontraditional therapeutic approaches [ 50 Candida S. aureus 51 4.8. Limitations of the Study Despite encouraging results, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, experiments were performed exclusively on planktonic cultures of reference strains, which do not replicate the complex architecture and resilience of clinical biofilms [ 52 53 54 55 56 20 55 4.9. Future Directions Future research should focus on expanding experimental models to include clinical isolates, polymicrobial biofilms, and in vivo conditions that mimic the oral environment. Dose–response studies are needed to identify efficacy plateaus, safety thresholds, and optimal irradiation parameters. Combinatorial strategies, such as integrating aPDT with conventional antifungal or antibacterial agents, nanoparticles, or immunomodulatory therapies, may help overcome species-specific resistance. The development of user-friendly delivery systems that reduce incubation times and standardize dosimetry would further enhance clinical adoption. If validated in controlled clinical trials, TBO-mediated aPDT could provide a minimally invasive, resistance-independent, and broadly applicable antimicrobial strategy. This aligns with global priorities in combating antimicrobial resistance and offers promise for immunocompromised individuals and patients with persistent or recurrent infections [ 56 57 5. Conclusions This study demonstrated that TBO-mediated aPDT with a 635 nm diode laser effectively reduced Candida Staphylococcus aureus Candida S. aureus Acknowledgments This research was conducted using the research infrastructure provided by Silesia LabMed—Research and Implementation Center, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice.
