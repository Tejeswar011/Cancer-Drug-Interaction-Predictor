Summary As a part of the commensal microbiome, the regulatory role of the intratumoral microbiome in tumor immunity is gradually revealed. However, the relationship between the intratumoral microbiome and the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) clinical treatment remains unclear. Here, we collect RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and clinical information from publicly available ICIs therapy cohorts. By developing an improved bioinformatics pipeline to identify the intratumoral microbiome and performing a comprehensive association analysis, we find that the intratumoral microbiome is associated with response to ICIs and characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME).

However, only a sizable minority of patients benefited from ICIs, and failed treatment is very common due to primary and acquired resistance. 1 With the development of sequencing technology and bioinformatics, increasing evidence demonstrated the vital role of gut microbiome in ICIs treatment outcomes. 2 , 3 4 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 14 , 15 In this study, firstly, intratumoral microbial reads from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 7 ICIs clinical cohorts were extracted with a bioinformatic pipeline. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to construct separate networks for the intratumoral microbial information and conduct association analysis with the efficacy of ICIs. Several microbial modules associated with the response or survival of ICIs-treated patients were identified. Second, correlation analyses between those microbes within associated modules and deconvolved tumor-infiltrating immune cell compositions, as well as immune response signatures, were performed, to determine the associations between the intratumoral microbiome and the TME. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of Burkholderia cepacia Priestia megaterium Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii Results Extracting intratumoral microbial information from ICIs therapy data To identify intratumoral microbial features related to the response to ICI treatment, we collected clinical information from 8 ICI therapy cohorts ( Table S1 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 Figure 1 24 Tables S2 STAR Methods Figure 1 Tables S3 STAR Methods Table S4 Figure 1 Extracting intratumoral microbiome from transcriptome of ICI trials (A) Flowchart of the study that details the samples utilized at each stage of statistical analysis. mGC, metastatic gastric cancer; rEAC, resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma; RCC, renal cell carcinoma; mUC, metastatic urothelial cancer; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; R, responders group; NR, non-responders group; OS, overall survival; PFS, progression-free survival.

Our analysis revealed several modules associated with improved response in melanoma and mGC, while a module was associated with worse response in rEAC.

Limitations of the study Several shortcomings of this study require consideration. First, despite consideration of decontamination, potential contaminants might persist throughout the analysis process. Second, the sample size of ICI therapy cohorts is small, which results in a lack of statistical power. Third, there is a lack of validation cohorts and clinical samples that could further confirm our findings. More publicly available sequencing data about intratumoral microbiome are still needed, and the development of new sequencing techniques and coordinated research approaches for uncovering host-intratumoral microbiome interactions is imperative.

Transcriptome data from different research sources may have errors due to different experimental conditions, which are reflected as batch effects at the gene expression level. Sva, an R package, provides two functions, Combat() and Combat_seq(), which can be used to correct for batch effects in high-dimensional data. 69 , 70 Beta diversity estimations Beta diversity was analyzed using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two samples was first calculated by the statistical algorithm of the vegan R package to obtain the distance matrix, and then the pcoa function in the ade4 R package was used to perform the PCoA. Generating a coexpression network by WGCNA Weighted gene co-occurrence network analysis (WGCNA) is an analytical method for analyzing gene expression patterns across multiple samples, which can cluster genes with similar expression patterns and identify the associations between modules and specific traits or phenotypes. 71 Table S5 Logistic regression analysis To determine the association between the intratumoral microbiome and response to ICIs treatment, logistic regression analysis was performed. To derive more easily interpretable Odd ratios (ORs), quartiles (25%, 50%,and 75%) of the abundance of individual microbes or the eigenvalues of microbial modules were modeled as continuous variables in the logistic regression models.
