Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic wounds. Accumulated AGEs bind to RAGE, activating various inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways such as NF-κB, PI3K-AKT, and JAK–STAT signaling, impairing normal wound healing. This review describes mechanisms by which the AGEs-RAGE axis disrupts vascular function, immune regulation, and cellular regeneration, thereby driving the formation of chronic non-healing wounds. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the AGEs-RAGE axis, such as selective RAGE inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, gene-based interventions, and AGE scavengers, highlighting their potential to enhance the treatment of diabetic chronic wounds. advanced glycation end products receptor for advanced glycation end products inflammation diabetes wound healing diabetic wound The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Global prevalence of diabetes was estimated at 10.5% (536.6 million) in 2021, with a projected rise to 12.2% (783.2 million) by 2045 ( 1 2 3 Wound healing is a highly orchestrated and complex process. Normal wounds (or acute wounds) healing typically contains four consecutive and overlapping stages: (a) Hemostasis stage: Vascular constriction occurs, with rapid recruitment of platelets and clotting factors to seal the wound; (b) Inflammation stage: Innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, migrate to the wound in response to inflammatory cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and eliminate pathogens and necrotic cells; (c) Proliferation stage: As inflammation resolves, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes proliferate and migrate from the wound margins, forming granulation tissue and regenerating the epidermis for wound closure; (d) Remodeling phase: The structure and composition of granulation tissue was remodeled. Some newly generated vessels atrophy, and collagen continues to deposit, ultimately leading to the formation of scars ( 4 In diabetic wounds, pathological factors such as bacterial infections, oxidative stress, local ischemia, persistent inflammation, and skin nerve atrophy collectively disrupt the normal healing cascade, resulting in chronic non-healing wounds. Signaling pathways mediating inflammation and oxidative stress are closely associated with these pathological alterations ( 5 6 7 In this review, we introduce the structure and function of AGEs and their receptor RAGE. Furthermore, we emphasize the contribution of the AGEs-RAGE axis in diabetic wounds and discuss therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway, aiming to provide innovative perspectives for enhancing diabetic wound healing. 2 AGEs and RAGE 2.1 The formation and accumulation of AGEs AGEs represent a highly heterogeneous class of compounds produced through a series of non-enzymatic reactions, known as the Maillard reaction ( 8 9 10 AGEs accumulate in the body via 8 11 12 13 14 15 15 2.2 Structure and isoforms of RAGE The RAGE gene is located within the histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on human chromosome 6 and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. The term “RAGE” generally refers to the full-length RAGE isoform, a transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of 404 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa. It is recognized as the only isoform capable of transducing signals ( 16 17 19 20 Figure 1 Figure 1 Basic structure and isoforms of RAGE. RAGE exists in four principal isoforms: Full-length RAGE, dnRAGE, sRAGE, and NtRAGE. Full-length RAGE consists of an extracellular domain (V, C1, and C2 domains), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. It is capable of binding multiple ligands, including AGEs, HMGB1, S100 proteins, Aβ, LPA, LPS, C1q, and nucleic acids, and requires oligomerization for signal transduction. dnRAGE, sRAGE, and NtRAGE lack complete structural domains. Upon ligand binding, they fail to activate downstream inflammatory pathways, thus functioning as signaling inhibitors. This figure was created in https://BioRender.com Diagram illustrating the interactions of multiple ligands with the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE). It shows full-length, oligomerized, and various forms of truncated RAGE on a cellular membrane. Ligands include AGEs, S100, LPS, nucleic acids, among others, which initiate inflammatory pathways. Different RAGE formations like dnRAGE, ceRAGE, esRAGE, and NtRAGE are depicted, demonstrating their distinct roles and reactions. RAGE exists in four main isoforms: the transmembrane signaling receptor (full-length RAGE, RAGE), the dominant negative form (dnRAGE), the circulating soluble forms (sRAGE), and the N-truncated form (NtRAGE) ( 21 22 23 23 25 26 27 28 29 Figure 1 2.3 Biological function and distribution of RAGE The primary biological function of RAGE is to act as a receptor that transduces ligand signals, initiating a cascade of downstream biochemical reactions. The cytoplasmic tail of RAGE lacks intrinsic kinase activity and therefore depends on adaptor proteins, such as the Formin homology 1 domain of diaphanous-1 (DIAPH1), DNAX-activating Protein 10 (DAP10), and Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) to initiate intracellular signaling ( 30 32 20 33 33 Figure 2 Figure 2 RAGE pathway and its effects. Upon binding its ligands, RAGE activates Ras/MEK/ERK, p38/MAPK, JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and Cdc42/Rac1 signaling pathways, along with NADPH oxidase through adaptor proteins such as DIAPH1, DAP10, and TIRAP. These downstream pathways subsequently activate transcription factors such as NF-κB, AP1, Egr1, and STAT3, driving gene expression and triggering a cascade of effects, including inflammation, cell migration, proliferation, senescence, death, and carcinogenesis. Moreover, activation of the RAGE pathway enhances the expression of RAGE itself and several of its ligands, like AGEs and HMGB1, creating a positive feedback loop that further amplifies RAGE signaling. This figure was created in https://BioRender.com Diagram illustrating cellular pathways activated by RAGE receptors. It shows interactions with adaptor proteins (DIAPH1, DAP10, TIRAP) leading to cascades via Ras, Cdc42/Rac1, and NADPH oxidase. These pathways influence gene expression and contribute to cell migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, cell death, carcinogenesis, and cell senescence. RAGE is widely expressed across multiple cell types. Under physiological conditions, RAGE is expressed at low levels in several cell types, including monocytes/macrophages, T-lymphocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells, glial cells, and chondrocytes ( 34 37 38 39 40 41 Figure 2 42 45 42 44 46 RAGE acts as a double-edged modulator in maintaining homeostasis. It exerts indispensable physiological roles while also driving pathological damage when dysregulated. During embryonic development, RAGE supports alveolar epithelial cell differentiation and the growth and migration of cerebral neurons ( 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 57 58 59 3 The effects of AGEs-RAGE axis in diabetic wounds 3.1 Peripheral neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy, including the impairment of sensory and autonomic nerves, is a common complication among diabetic patients ( 60 Sensory nerves extend into the epidermal layer, where they detect and transmit external stimuli to the central nervous system to initiate defensive responses. Beyond their sensory role, these nerves regulate skin growth and maintain homeostasis by secreting neurotrophic factors and neuropeptides ( 61 62 63 64 61 65 Long-term activation of RAGE impairs the autonomic nervous system as well ( 66 67 Figure 3 Figure 3 AGEs-RAGE axis promotes the formation of diabetic wounds. Sustained activation of the AGEs-RAGE axis drives a range of pathological alterations that accelerate the formation of diabetic wounds, including atherosclerosis, thrombotic tendencies, impaired vasodilation, peripheral neuropathy, dysfunction of repair cells, and abnormal expression of ncRNAs. This figure was created in https://BioRender.com Diagram illustrating the effects of the sustained AGEs-RAGE axis activation on diabetic wound formation. The process includes atherosclerosis, thrombotic tendencies, abnormal vasodilation, and peripheral neuropathy leading to skin ischemia, hypoxia, and altered pain thresholds. These contribute to impaired functions in neutrophils, macrophages, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, resulting in decreased migration, proliferation, phagocytosis, and collagen synthesis. Microribonucleic acids, long non-coding ribonucleic acids, and circular ribonucleic acids are also involved. The diagram culminates in the depiction of a diabetic foot ulcer. 3.2 Vascular lesions Local skin ischemia and hypoxia, primarily resulting from vascular abnormalities such as atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombotic tendencies, play a central role in the impaired healing of diabetic wounds. Activation of the RAGE pathway promotes the development of these pathological changes ( 68 Figure 3 Atherosclerosis is characterized by lipid deposition, fibrous proliferation, and calcification within the arterial intima, eventually leading to plaque formation and vascular narrowing. Atherosclerosis is prevalent in the lower extremities of diabetic patients and primarily affects the mid-sized arteries, such as the posterior and anterior tibial arteries ( 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 Endothelial dysfunction, marked by impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation, significantly influences blood supply to distal small vessels and exacerbates the narrowing of atherosclerotic vessels ( 76 77 78 Thrombotic tendencies arise from increased platelet counts and hyperactivity, which can worsen atherosclerosis and occlude small blood vessels. RAGE expression is elevated in the platelets of diabetic and aging patients. The AGEs-RAGE axis enhances the activity and aggregation capacity of platelets, promoting a pre-thrombotic state ( 79 80 81 3.3 Dysfunction of cells for wound repair 3.3.1 Neutrophils Neutrophils are the first immune cells to arrive at wounds, primarily tasked with killing microbes. Overactivation of RAGE by AGEs disrupts the neutrophil extravasation and compromises their pathogen-killing abilities ( 82 83 84 Figure 3 85 3.3.2 Macrophages Macrophages are the orchestrators of wound inflammation ( 86 87 89 90 Figure 3 3.3.3 Keratinocytes Wound closure depends on re-epithelialization driven by keratinocyte migration and proliferation. The AGEs-RAGE axis inhibits keratinocyte proliferation, migration, epidermal lipid synthesis, and the expression of epidermal antimicrobial peptides by promoting inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby impairing epidermal regeneration and barrier function ( 91 92 via 93 94 95 Figure 3 3.3.4 Fibroblasts Dermal is the primary structural component of skin, and its repair largely relies on the proliferation, differentiation, and ECM remodeling by fibroblasts. Accumulated AGEs form stable cross-links with the main component of the ECM, collagen fibers, disrupting the normal collagen structure and leading to increased nano-stiffness and reduced hydration in the ECM ( 96 98 99 100 101 Figure 3 3.3.5 Endothelial cells Angiogenesis driven by endothelial cells is crucial to wound healing. The RAGE activated by high levels of AGEs inhibits endothelial cell migration and promotes various forms of cellular dysfunction, including autophagy abnormalities, senescence, apoptosis, and ferroptosis ( 102 103 via 104 105 106 Figure 3 3.4 Abnormal expression of ncRNAs Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs, miR), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA, lnc), and circular RNAs (circRNAs, circ), serve as critical regulators of gene expression through epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional mechanisms ( 107 108 109 110 111 112 Figure 3 113 114 4 Strategies targeting the AGEs-RAGE axis for diabetic wound repair RAGE-induced chronic inflammation plays a critical pathogenic role in the development of diabetic wounds, positioning the AGEs-RAGE axis as a promising therapeutic target. Several strategies have been developed to directly inhibit this axis, including specific small molecule inhibitors, gene therapy targeting RAGE, monoclonal antibodies, AGE scavenger, and sRAGE. Here, we focus on the AGEs-RAGE axis-targeted interventions that have shown efficacy in diabetic wound healing ( Table 1 Table 1 Interventions for the AGEs-RAGE axis and their preclinical/clinical efficacy in diabetic wounds.

( 163 164 165 166 4.1 Small molecule RAGE inhibitors Several small-molecule inhibitors targeting the extracellular or intracellular domains of RAGE have been developed. FPS-ZM1 is a non-toxic tertiary amide compound that binds to the V-domain of RAGE to block its interaction with ligands. Recently, Sun et al. ( 115 116 117 RAGE229 is a novel small molecular inhibitor to block the interaction between the intracellular domain of RAGE and DIAPH1. Topical application of RAGE229 has been demonstrated to significantly accelerate wound healing in type 2 diabetic mice ( 118 4.2 RAGE antibodies Monoclonal antibodies targeting RAGE block signal transduction by directly binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor. Johnson et al. ( 119 120 120 121 121 4.3 Gene therapy for RAGE Reducing the expression of RAGE through gene therapy is a promising approach ( 122 123 57 88 124 126 127 128 129 130 131 134 135 Targeting the RAGE exhibits substantial potential in diabetic wound healing. However, given RAGE’s critical roles in physiological processes, complete blockade via vaccines or gene manipulation may impair its homeostatic functions. Increased abscess formation and delayed wound healing are observed in the RAGE knockout mice ( 136 137 4.4 Targeting AGEs In addition to directly targeting RAGE, another effective strategy for limiting RAGE pathway activation is enhancing the clearance of its ligands. Several specific approaches targeting AGEs clearance have been identified to promote the healing of diabetic wounds. Aminoguanidine is a classic AGE scavenger that reduces the production of AGEs by neutralizing carbonyl compounds ( 138 139 140 141 143 142 sRAGE non-specifically binds to RAGE ligands, obstructing their interaction with RAGE and consequently inhibiting RAGE signaling. Localized application of sRAGE significantly reduces inflammation in diabetic wounds while also enhancing the expression of multiple growth factors, promoting collagen deposition, and accelerating angiogenesis ( 144 145 in vitro 4.5 Other approaches for the AGEs-RAGE axis inhibition 4.5.1 Pharmacological regulation Another method for inhibiting the AGEs-RAGE axis involves natural or synthetic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs along with diabetic management agents. Polyphenolic compounds can scavenge ROS and inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-κB to reduce inflammation ( 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 155 The classic anti-diabetic agent rosiglitazone inhibits the harmful effects of the AGEs-RAGE axis by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma pathway ( 156 157 158 162 4.5.2 Lifestyle interventions Lifestyle and dietary habits significantly influence the levels of AGEs. AGEs are particularly abundant in red meat, dairy products, processed foods, high-sugar diets, and foods prepared using high-temperature cooking methods such as frying, grilling, and roasting. In contrast, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and foods prepared using moist-heat cooking techniques (poaching, steaming, and stewing) contain lower AGEs ( 163 in vivo 164 166 5 Conclusion and future perspective The AGEs-RAGE axis serves as a crucial mediator in diabetic wound pathogenesis by driving chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular dysfunction through sustained activation of multiple inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Current intervention strategies, including RAGE inhibitors, gene silencing, AGE scavengers, various anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs, and several anti-diabetic agents, demonstrate preclinical efficacy in restoring angiogenesis, resolving inflammation, and promoting tissue repair. Dietary and lifestyle interventions further complement these approaches by reducing systemic AGE accumulation. However, the transition from preclinical success to clinical application remains a critical challenge, necessitating rigorous trials to validate safety and efficacy in diverse diabetic populations. Future research should prioritize cost-effective, targeted therapies, such as innovative delivery systems and multimodal combinatorial regimens. Notably, the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years are expected to accelerate the discovery and development of more effective AGEs-RAGE axis-targeted drugs. Interdisciplinary collaboration and public health initiatives are essential to bridge mechanistic insights with transformative clinical outcomes, ultimately improving the quality of life for patients with diabetic wounds.
