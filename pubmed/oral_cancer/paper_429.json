Here we report results of the phase 1b/2 study of ramucirumab, a monoclonal anti-VEGFR-2 antibody, plus the anti-MET monoclonal antibody emibetuzumab. Patients and Methods: A 3+3 dose escalation of emibetuzumab plus ramucirumab (Phase 1b) was followed by tumor-specific expansion cohorts. Primary objectives were to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to evaluate antitumor activity. Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Tumoral MET expression was explored by immunohistochemistry. Results: 97 solid tumor patients (6 phase 1b, 16 GEJ, 45 HCC, 15 RCC, and 15 NSCLC) received emibetuzumab at 750 or 2000 mg flat dosing plus ramucirumab at 8mg/kg Q2W. No DLTs were observed. Common AEs were primarily mild or moderate and included fatigue (36.1%), peripheral edema (28.9%), and nausea (14.4%). Emibetuzumab exposures were similar as in previous studies with no apparent drug-drug interactions. Five partial responses (5.2%) were observed across all tumor types. The greatest anti-tumor activity was noted in HCC with a 6.7% ORR, 60% DCR, and 5.42 months (95% CI: 1.64–8.12) PFS. HCC with high MET expression showed improved PFS with approximately threefold increase in PFS (8.1 vs. 2.8 months) relative to low MET expression. Conclusions: Ramucirumab plus emibetuzumab was safe and exhibited cytostatic antitumor activity. MET expression may help to select patients benefitting most from this combination treatment in select tumor types.
