The urobiome (microbiota of the urinary tract) likely functions similarly. However, efforts to characterize the urobiome and assess its functional potential have been limited due to technical challenges including low microbial biomass and high host cell shedding in urine. Here, to begin addressing these challenges, we evaluate urine sample volume (100 ml–5 mL) and host DNA depletion methods and their effects on urobiome profiles in healthy dogs, which are a robust large animal model for the human urobiome. We collected urine from seven dogs and fractionated samples into aliquots. One set of samples was spiked with host (canine) cells to model a biologically relevant host cell burden in urine. Samples then underwent DNA extraction followed by 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We then assembled metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and compared microbial composition and diversity across groups. We tested six methods of DNA extraction: QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia (no host depletion), QIAamp DNA Microbiome, Molzym MolYsis, NEBNext Microbiome DNA Enrichment, Zymo HostZERO, and propidium monoazide. Results In relation to urine sample volume, ≥ 3.0 mL resulted in the most consistent urobiome profiling. In relation to host depletion, individual (dog) but not extraction method drove overall differences in microbial composition. DNA Microbiome yielded the greatest microbial diversity in 16S rRNA sequencing data and shotgun metagenomic sequencing data and maximized MAG recovery while effectively depleting host DNA in host-spiked urine samples. As proof-of-principle, we then mined MAGs for select metabolic functions including central metabolism pathways and environmental chemical degradation. Conclusions Our findings provide guidelines for studying the urobiome in relation to sample volume and host depletion and lay the foundation for future evaluation of urobiome function in relation to health and disease.

In this study, we assess four commercially available DNA extraction kits that include host DNA depletion (MolYsis Complete5, NEBNext Microbiome DNA Enrichment Kit, QIAamp DNA Microbiome Kit, and Zymo HostZERO) as well as a protocol using light-activated propidium monoazide and compare them to a method with no host depletion (BiOstic Bacteremia). Host depletion has been successful in other low-microbial-biomass, high-host-biomass substrates including breast milk, oral, respiratory tract, and tumor samples [ 20 24 21 The urobiome has been characterized via culture, whole genome sequencing of urine isolates, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. However, few studies have reported metagenome-assembled microbial genomes (MAGs) and genome-resolved community analyses of the urobiota [ 25 28 29 30 In this study, we tested several approaches for studying the urobiome using urine from healthy dogs. Dogs are a robust translational model for the human urobiome [ 1 31 33 34 31 33 S1 S2 Methods Urine volume experiment The goal of this first experiment was to determine if microbial community profiles and the presence/abundance of microbial contaminants (e.g., from reagents, kits) differed by urine sample volume (Experimental Design: Fig. S1 Subject recruitment Healthy dogs ( Canis familiaris S1 Urine sample collection and preparation Midstream, free-catch urine (which includes microbes from the bladder, urethra, and periurethral skin) was collected and stored from five healthy dogs as described previously [ 35 DNA extraction and quantification DNA was extracted using the QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia DNA Kit (Bacteremia; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as described previously [ 36 16S rRNA gene library preparation and sequencing DNA then underwent library preparation and sequencing at Argonne National Laboratory (Lemont, IL, USA), as described previously [ 36 16S rRNA gene sequence processing and statistical analyses Raw sequences were processed using QIIME2 v.2023–5. Reads were denoised and clustered into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using DADA2 [ 37 decontam 38 S2 n 39 42 For all analyses, statistical significance was set at p phyloseq vegan t Q 43 Q Host depletion — 16S rRNA gene The goal of this experiment was to evaluate how DNA extraction methods that include host depletion steps affected bacterial DNA recovery and microbial community profiles (Experimental Design: Fig. S2 Urine sample collection, host cell spiking, and DNA extraction We collected midstream-free catch urine from seven healthy dogs (Table S1 44 45 21 All of these methods except QIAamp Bacteremia included host depletion steps. In addition to urine samples, we also included a positive control sample (ZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA, Table S3 n Host depletion — shotgun metagenomics DNA extraction methods QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia (Qiagen) No host depletion is included in this protocol. Protocol is detailed above under urine volume experiment. For the ZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard, prior to extraction, the standard was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant and pellet were then separated, and both were saved. Per recommendations from Zymo, the pellet was then processed through the Bacteremia kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. In the final step, the supernatant was added to the MB spin column (along with the pellet lysate) and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 1 min. This captured any additional DNA from the supernatant on the spin column. Molzym MolYsis Complete5 (Molzym MoYsis) This method uses a chaotropic buffer to selectively lyse host cells and then removes host DNA using a DNAase prior to extracting microbial DNA. Samples were extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol. NEBNext Microbiome DNA Enrichment Kit (NEBNext) This method uses nonselective lysis followed by selective binding and depletion of CpG-methylated host DNA in order to enrich microbial DNA recovery. Samples were first extracted using the QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia DNA Kit and frozen at − 80 °C. Samples were defrosted, and further extraction was performed according to the NEBNext manufacturer’s protocol. For samples that did not have detectable DNA after the initial extraction, a threshold of 0.05 ng/mL was used to calculate the MBD2-Fc protein to protein A magnetic bead value. A solution of MBD2-FC protein and protein A magnetic beads was prepared and aliquoted into each sample accordingly. To avoid DNA loss, purification was not performed at the end of the protocol (neither option A nor B). QIAamp DNA Microbiome Kit (DNA Microbiome) This method uses selective osmotic lysis and benzonase to degrade host cells and digest host DNA prior to extraction of microbial DNA. A ThermoMixer at 600 rpm was used instead of end-over-end rotation. Prior to extraction, the ZymoBIOMICS Gut Microbiome Standard was centrifuged at 20,000 g, and the supernatant was saved. To maximize DNA recovery per recommendations from Zymo, the pellet was processed through the kit, and the supernatant was added to the MB spin column and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 1 min. The flow-through was discarded, and lysate from the pellet was added per the manufacturer’s protocol at step 12. Zymo HostZERO Microbial DNA Kit (Zymo) This method uses selective osmotic lysis followed by enzymatic degradation of DNA to degrade host cells and host DNA prior to extraction of microbial DNA. A FastPrep-24 5G bead beater was used for optimized lysis. Extraction proceeded following the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were eluted with 20–26 µL ZymoBIOMICs DNase RNase-Free Water. Propidium monoazide (PMA) This method uses PMA to intercalate the DNA of membrane-disrupted host cells, and Light activation triggers covalent bonding between dsDNA and PMA, fragmenting the DNA. Samples were pretreated with 10-µM PMA as described in Marotz et al. (2018), beginning with resuspending urine pellets in 200-µL sterile water. After PMA treatment, samples were stored at − 20 °C and then extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia kit. DNA quantification and 16S rRNA gene sequencing In both spiked and unspiked samples, we quantified total DNA via Qubit fluorometer and bacterial DNA via qPCR using universal 16S rRNA gene bacterial primers as described previously [ 36 46 S4 Urine volume experiment S3 Urine volume experiment 16S rRNA gene sequence processing and statistical analyses 16S rRNA gene sequencing processing and statistical analyses were performed as described above (see the “ Urine volume experiment Host depletion — shotgun metagenomics The goal of this experiment was to assess host depletion by extraction method and the viability of performing genome-resolved metagenomics on low-biomass urine samples. To do this, we used the same urine samples and ZymoBIOMICs Gut Microbiome Standard positive control from the “Host depletion — 16S rRNA gene” experiment described above and spiked them with host (canine) cells (Experimental Design: Fig. S2 Shotgun metagenomic library preparation and sequencing Samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing at the Ohio State University Infectious Diseases Institute — Genomics and Microbiology Solutions (IDI-GEMS) Laboratory. Metagenomic libraries were prepared following the Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) DNA Library Prep protocol with the following modifications: (1) Illumina’s (M) beads were substituted with (L) beads to obtain larger insert sizes, (2) 9 or 12 PCR amplification cycles were used based on sample DNA concentration (Qubit) (Fig. S4 47 n n 48 Metagenomic sequence processing and statistical analyses Raw reads from the Illumina sequencer were quality filtered and trimmed of adapters using Trimmomatic [ 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 decontam 62 decontam S5 Bradyrhizobium Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens phyloseq 63 vegan 64 tidyverse 65 Q Q 29 Hydrocarbon degradation profiling As a proof-of-principal test, we then mined the MAGs for microbial functions of interest, including urea utilization and environmental chemical degradation. These functions are relevant as urine is a urea-rich environment, and environmental chemicals, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, have been associated with urinary tract diseases like bladder cancer. Urea utilization was identified by searching within the DRAM output. To identify putative hydrocarbon degrading genes, we queried custom, curated, and published hidden Markov model (HMM) profile databases: aerobic degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pathways (PAHp) [ 66 67 68 e Results Urine volume experiment Current urobiome studies vary widely in the volume of urine used for profiling microbial communities. Moreover, low biomass samples, like urine, are highly susceptible to contamination by microbes or microbial DNA (hereafter referred to as “contaminants”) that can be introduced during the DNA extraction and sequencing process. As such, in this experiment, we first assessed the relationship between urine sample volume and microbial contaminant load. Contaminants, as identified by decontam S2 1 S6 p Fig. 1 Urine sample volume influences contaminant abundance and microbial diversity (16S). A p n S6 B p p p p n S7 C p n We then evaluated bacterial diversity and composition by urine sample volume. Microbial richness, or the total number of unique ASVs in each sample, increased significantly with sample volume (Figs. 1 S7 p 1 Bacterial composition, however, did not differ significantly by urine sample volume but did differ significantly between dogs (Figs. 2 S5 p 2 S6 p 2 p Fig. 2 Urine sample volume and microbial composition (16S). A p p n B n C p n Host depletion — 16S rRNA gene Healthy urine contains shed host epithelial cells at a relatively low abundance. However, in the presence of urinary tract disease (e.g., urinary tract infection, bladder cancer, bladder stones), host cell shedding can dramatically increase. There are multiple DNA extraction methods that incorporate host cell/host DNA depletion steps to facilitate microbial DNA recovery. In this experiment, we evaluated how six different extraction methods affected DNA concentrations and microbial community profiles. Extraction methods included the following: QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia DNA Kit (Bacteremia), MolYsis Complete5 (Molzym), NEBNext Microbiome DNA Enrichment Kit, QIAamp DNA Microbiome Kit (DNA Microbiome), HostZERO Microbial DNA Kit (Zymo HostZERO), and a protocol using light-activated propidium monoazide described in Marotz et al. (2018) [ 21 36 1 4 We first compared how each extraction method impacted total and bacterial DNA concentrations derived from urine samples. We also compared DNA concentrations in urine samples that were unspiked versus those spiked with host (canine) cells. While healthy midstream-free catch urine contains a low abundance of host cells, we opted to spike additional canine cells into urine at biologically relevant concentrations to best assess the host depletion capabilities of each extraction method. In unspiked samples, there was no significant difference in total DNA (host + microbial) concentrations by extraction method ( p 3 bacterial p 3 3 p p 3 p S7 Fig. 3 Total and bacterial DNA recovery differed by extraction method.

To do this, we assembled MAGs within each sample (assembly metrics for each sample: Fig. S10). We generated a total of 26 unique MAGs: 11 were bacteria found in the ZymoBIOMICs Gut Microbiome Standard (Table S3 7 S5 E. coli n S11 p S11 p Fig. 7 Top 20 microbial genera represented in urine samples.

Staphylococcus pseudintermedius Bacillus cereus S13B Next, we looked for microbial metabolic pathways associated with environmental chemical metabolism. There are a number of widely distributed environmental chemicals (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, long chain alkanes) that have been linked to urinary tract diseases like bladder cancer [ 69 70 72 ladB Bacillus_A cereus ladA S. pseudintermedius B. cereus ssuD 8 B. cereus S. pseudintermedius ladA 8 Fig. 8 Metabolic potential of urine-associated MAGs. A B ssuD ladB Discussion Studies of the urobiome are poised to reveal key insights in urinary tract health and disease; however, validation of approaches to profiling the urine microbial community is urgently needed. Here, we tested urine sampling volume and DNA extraction methods with host depletion using urine from healthy dogs. We identified a minimum urine volume threshold for 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and we report on best host depletion methods for obtaining representative and reproducible microbial profiles. Finally, we demonstrate that MAG assembly is feasible in low-microbial, high-host biomass urine samples, and that even in this limited study, we were able to gain novel functional insights into urine-associated microbes. In relation to urine volume, we observed that greater urine volumes (≥ 3 mL) resulted in improved microbial community capture, increased read depth (although not significant), reduced stochasticity/variability between samples, and reduced contaminant abundance (Figs. 1 2 S5 S6 20 73 11 We next assessed the impact of DNA extraction methods with and without host depletion on multiple sample types (unspiked and host-spiked urine) and sequencing platforms (16S rRNA, shotgun metagenomics). In unspiked (low host biomass) urine, Bacteremia (no host depletion) and DNA Microbiome (host depletion) consistently yielded the greatest DNA concentrations and highest microbial diversity (16S rRNA) (Figs. 3 4 S12 20 36 20 74 76 In host-spiked (high host biomass) urine samples, DNA Microbiome, Zymo, and Molzym yielded the greatest percentage of microbial reads (22, 70, and 71%, respectively) (shotgun metagenomics, Fig. 5 6 23 74 77 24 12 38 Important insights have been revealed via read-level analysis of shotgun-sequenced urobiota. For example, in one study, shifts in microbial functional potential were observed in longitudinally collected urine samples of individuals with and without urinary tract symptoms [ 4 27 28 E. faecalis 26 78 MAG generation offers advantages over read-level analyses and culture as it uniquely provides high-resolution information on specific microbes and their potential functions, without a dependence on culture [ 79 B. cereus S. pseudintermedius S. canis Arcanobacterium 28 2 36 80 Although the overall number of MAGs we recovered was low, we note that DNA Microbiome yielded a greater number of urine-derived MAGs and generally fewer contaminant MAGs as compared to all other extraction methods. Importantly, the fact that we were able to assemble 11 MAGs from contaminants (i.e., microbial DNA present in reagents and identifiable in negative control samples) highlights the need for rigorous negative controls as well as thorough bioinformatic decontamination to avoid spurious results. Well-validated tools such as decontam 12 38 62 After assembling MAGs, we went on to identify key functions in each MAG including core carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways, urea metabolism, and environmental chemical degradation. We identified full urea-degrading complexes (ureABCEFGD) in two MAGs ( B. cereus S. pseudintermedius S13 81 69 82 2 B. cereus S. pseudintermedius 70 83 84 85 86 88 Conclusions Key takeaways from this study are as follows: Urine sample volumes of ≥ 3 mL produced the most consistent urobiome profiles in dogs, which are a robust model for the human urobiome. Microbial taxa found at ≥ 0.1% abundance were reliably detected via 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, but MAG assembly was only feasible at greater abundances (≥ 1.5%), and strain differentiation in metagenomic data may require a higher ANI threshold than employed in this study (99% ANI was used in this study). Generally, interindividual differences in urobiome profiles overwhelmed differences due to DNA extraction method. In urine samples with low host biomass (unspiked), the QIAamp BiOstic Bacteremia kit (with no host depletion) yielded the greatest microbial DNA concentrations and highest microbial diversity (e.g., captured more/rarer urine taxa). In urine samples with high host biomass (host-spiked), the QIAamp DNA Microbiome kit yielded the greatest microbial DNA concentrations, highest microbial diversity, and greatest number of identified metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) while effectively depleting host DNA. MAG assembly is feasible but limited in urine samples. Maximizing urine volume to increase microbial reads would likely improve MAG recovery. Gene-based queries to assess functional potential of the urobiome are feasible with shotgun metagenomic data in the absence of MAG assembly, although linking function (genes) to microbial species is more challenging with this approach. Urine-derived MAGs revealed evidence of urea and environmental chemical (long-chain alkane) degradation, both of which are relevant for understanding how microbes live and adapt to the urine environment, as well as how they can potentially modulate environmental exposures in a way that could impact host health. Urobiome research trails the study of other host-associated microbiomes [ 10 Supplementary information  Supplementary material 1.
