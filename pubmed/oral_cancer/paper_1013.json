Introduction Feed can contain numerous undesirable substances that may pose a danger not only to animals but also to humans, due to their potential transfer into derived food products. Directive 2002/32/EC states that the use of feed intended for food-producing animals is prohibited when the presence of such compounds exceeds the maximum levels [ 1 2 3 4 5 Mycotoxin-producing fungi can contaminate feed and food, with health implications for animals and humans, respectively. The toxicity of mycotoxins varies depending on their chemical structure [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 8 17 18 Since the co-occurrence of mycotoxins in crops and animal feed represents a huge challenge in terms of reduced animal performance and increased production costs [ 19 20 21 22 2.

Standards and Internal Standards Individual standard solutions (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, DON, FB1, FB2, OTA, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, ZEA) and relative isotopically internal standards ([ 13 17 13 17 13 17 13 17 13 15 13 34 13 34 13 20 13 24 13 22 13 15 2.2.3. Preparation of Standard Solutions and Internal Standard Solutions Working standard solutions were prepared at different concentrations: 100 ng/mL for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2, 500 ng/mL for T-2 and HT-2 toxins, 100 ng/mL for OTA, 5 µg/mL for ZEA, 10 µg/mL for DON, and 5 µg/mL for FB1 and FB2. For isotopically internal standards, the following working solutions were prepared: 100 ng/mL for [ 13 17 13 17 13 17 13 17 13 24 13 22 13 20 13 15 13 15 13 34 13 34 2.2.4. Sample Preparation The sample was prepared according to Nualkaw et al. [ 23 4 18 4 2.2.5. LC-MS/MS Analysis Instrumental analysis was performed according to Nualkaw et al. [ 23 + The authors applied the instrumental conditions reported by Nualkaw et al. [ 23 v v v v Table 1 Table 2 For positive ionization, the ion source temperature was set to 500 °C, the capillary voltage to 5100 V, the curtain gas to 35 °C, and the entrance potential to 10, while for negative ionization, the capillary voltage was set to −4300 V and the entrance potential to −10. 2.3. Method Validation The method was validated according to the performance criteria established by the EUR-MP guidance document [ 24 25 Table 3 26 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Method Validation Results Instrumental linearity was assessed for all mycotoxins at six calibration points ( Table 4 Table 5 Because certified reference material was not available, trueness was assessed using recovery experiments. Repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility were determined by analyzing blank samples spiked at four levels on two different days. To minimize matrix effects due to a straightforward sample preparation protocol, quantification was performed with matrix-matched standard calibration curves, plotting the analyte area divided by the area of internal standards versus the analyte concentration. The correlation coefficient indicated a good fit for all analytes, with values reported in the range of 0.991–0.999. Precision was expressed in terms of repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility as RDS. The results of the precision study are summarized in Table 6 Average recoveries for all investigated mycotoxins ranged between 76 and 108%. The maximum value of within-laboratory reproducibility was 12.6% at a spiking level of 0.010 mg/kg. Measurement uncertainty was estimated by considering the internal laboratory reproducibility. The value obtained according to the NT approach was multiplied by a coverage factor of 2 to obtain an expanded uncertainty calculated at a 95% confidence level ( Table 6 24 3.2. Mycotoxin Occurrence in Feed Samples The presence of one or more mycotoxins was detected in 85 (42%) samples, of which 35 (41%) were feed materials, 36 (42%) complementary feed, and 14 (17%) complete feed. The mean concentrations in the different categories of feed samples are reported in Table 7 Supplementary Material (Table S2) 27 Regarding the statistical analysis, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test did not reveal any adherence to a normal distribution; then, a nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons post-test were performed, comparing selected pairs of feed sample columns. A statistically significant difference was observed between feed materials and complementary feed for ZEA ( p p Further studies conducted in Italian regions have reported the presence of mycotoxins in feed. Sdogati et al. [ 28 29 30 Regarding the incidence of mycotoxin contamination worldwide, the highest number of positive samples for AFs, OTA and ZEA was reported in Asia, followed by Europe, while the latter was the first-ranking continent with the highest number of observations of the presence of DON, T2 and HT-2 and FBs in animal feed. These data can be associated with mild temperatures, high humidity and heavy rainfall that can occur in many European countries, favoring fungal growth and mycotoxin production. The mycotoxin prevalence was reported in the following rank order: DON (74%) > ZEA (70%) > FBs (65%) > AFs (59%) > T-2 and HT-2 (45%) > OTA (31%) [ 31 The incidence of each mycotoxin studied in all samples, regardless of feed category, is shown in Figure 1 A similar trend in feed contamination by different groups of mycotoxins has been reported in the literature. Liu et al. [ 32 33 23 The presence of FBs (80.1 and 83.3%), DON (80.6 and 67.2%), ZEA (47.1 and 57.5%) and total AFs (9.6 and 5.8%) was observed in maize and finished feed from South Africa, respectively. The latter group exceeded the regulatory limit for AFB1 established in the European Union in 33.3% of maize samples and 54.4% of finished feed. OTA and T-2 toxin were detected at lower rates (7.4 and 3.1% and 0.7 and 1.3%, respectively). Maximum levels of FBs, DON and ZEA were found in maize and finished feed at concentrations of 16 and 7.5, 9.2 and 9.8, and 6.3 and 0.38 mg/kg, respectively. Total AFs and OTA showed maximum concentrations of 0.014 and 0.23 and 0.095 and 0.0060 mg/kg in maize and finished feed, respectively. The simultaneous presence of mycotoxins in the same sample was particularly related to FBs and DON (55.9%), FBs and ZEA (58.7%), and FBs and AFs (60.8%) [ 34 In our study, 30 (35%) positive samples showed the co-occurrence of different groups of mycotoxins in the same feed sample ( Figure 2 The highest incidence was observed for DON + ZEA + FBs (23%), followed by the same mycotoxin groups with T-2 and HT-2, and ZEA + FBs (20%). The concomitant occurrence of DON and ZEA has been shown to be among the most common resulting from pre-harvest contamination by fungi of the Fusarium 35 36 Simultaneous exposure to multiple mycotoxins can cause more severe toxic effects in animals due to complex, often synergistic or additive interactions, which can exacerbate various disorders, such as immune suppression, impaired reproduction, oxidative stress and organ dysfunction, resulting in reduced growth performance, decreased milk and egg production and even increased mortality rates. For example, the concomitant presence of AFB1, OTA and ZEA can reduce milk yield in ruminants, while DON and ZEA together show synergistic action in pigs, causing reduced weight gain and feed intake. Immune and reproductive effects (i.e., immunosuppression and ovarian dysfunction) have been reported in pigs exposed to AFB1 and DON and ZEA and DON, respectively [ 37 The prevalence of mycotoxin contamination in agricultural raw materials is associated with several factors, such as seasonality and climate conditions, agriculture management practices, and fungal ecology. Different fungi can produce mycotoxins both during harvest and post-harvest stages. Dimitrakopoulou et al. [ 38 Fusarium 39 40 Fusarium 41 42 43 44 45 46 Mycotoxin contamination in animal feed also represents a significant human health concern, as it can lead to the presence of mycotoxins in animal-derived products such as milk, posing a risk to consumers, particularly children and immunocompromised individuals. Carry-over of mycotoxins in milk depends on animal feed intake and milk production [ 47 48 49 4. Conclusions The present study revealed the co-presence of several mycotoxins in the same feed samples, although some groups were detected at low concentrations. No sample exceeded the guideline values for all mycotoxins, except one feed that was non-compliant for AFB1. These findings could pose a potential health risk to both animals and humans due to their possible synergistic and/or additive effects. Practical recommendations for farmers and feed producers could include pre- and post-harvest preventive measures, taking into account the variety of crop species with varying fungal resistance, and crop management (e.g., crop rotation, plowing, minimum-till or no-till technology, appropriate sowing date) in the former case, as well as cleaning and sorting practices and dehulling and thorough milling of grains after harvest. Thermal processes for reducing mycotoxins during feed production could be based on dry heating, superheated steam, extrusion cooking, and irradiation [ 50 37 Continuous monitoring of mycotoxins is strongly recommended to build a database of their presence in feed. The high-throughput LC-MS/MS analytical method used in this study for the determination and quantification of various mycotoxins in feed samples represents a valuable tool for achieving this important objective. Furthermore, risk assessment studies are needed for all groups of mycotoxins detected, even at low levels, to fully understand the potential adverse effects from human and animal exposure and to develop an effective risk mitigation plan. The mycotoxin concentrations detected in this study could be used to assess dietary exposure of animals based on consumption and species data.
