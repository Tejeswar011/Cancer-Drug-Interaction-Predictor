Until now, a crystalline anhydrate (Form A) has been used in preclinical and clinical studies. However, a novel dihydrate crystal (Form B) was recently discovered, offering improved solid-state stability without compromising its absorption, systemic exposure, and metabolism. We sought to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Form B and compare it to the well-characterized PK profile of Form A in a series of studies conducted in mice, dogs, and humans. Our data revealed that although the two forms are distinct and do not interconvert, they exhibit comparable PK profiles both within and across species. Consistent with previous reports, Form A and Form B alike reached fast peak plasma concentrations (<2 h), demonstrated efficient partitioning into brain tissue, and were fully cleared by 12 h post-dose. Furthermore, metabolic profiling showed that both forms produced identical PK profiles for the primary metabolites, N1- and N8-norbuntanetap, confirming that Form B retains the established metabolic characteristics of Form A. These findings support the continued development of Form B for future clinical use, as it combines enhanced solid-state stability with a preserved PK profile essential for buntanetap’s therapeutic efficacy. buntanetap polymorph pharmacokinetics neurodegenerative diseases blood–brain barrier Annovis Bio, Inc.

Introduction Buntanetap (formerly known as posiphen) is an orally bioavailable small molecule which is currently being investigated for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [ 1 2 3 Buntanetap is the (+)-enantiomer of phenserine; however, while phenserine has acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibiting activity, buntanetap does not [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 2 3 7 10 14 15 10 16 17 18 19 20 3 21 21 15 Buntanetap was originally discovered to only have APP inhibiting activity and no AChE inhibiting (AChEi) activity, in vitro. However, in vivo, whether in rodents, dogs or humans, buntanetap undergoes N-demethylation at N1 and N8 positions, generating N1-norbuntanetap and N8-norbuntanetap, respectively [ 19 3 5 18 19 20 21 19 20 22 To date, preclinical and clinical studies have utilized the anhydrous form of buntanetap. However, we have recently discovered a crystalline dihydrate form, which offers greater stability in the solid state without compromising its solubility. To distinguish between these forms, we will refer to the original anhydrous buntanetap as Form A and the new dihydrate crystalline form as Form B. The key difference between these forms lies in their hydration states. Form A is an anhydrate, meaning the lattice does not contain water. In contrast, Form B is a dihydrate with two moles of water in the crystal lattice. This fundamental difference makes the two forms distinct—both forms are stable and do not readily interconvert. Previously, we have described the PK of Form A across several animal models and human studies, demonstrating achievement of fast plasma peak levels (within 2 h post-dose) and high brain tissue levels, followed by rapid clearance from plasma within 8 h and much longer clearance from CSF and brain within 12 h [ 22 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Buntanetap Form A and Form B 2.1.1. Synthesis of Form A (Anhydrate) Buntanetap base was dissolved in ethanol (3.5 mL/g), and the solution was heated to 35–50 °C. A solution of D-tartaric acid (1.0 eq.) in ethanol (3.5 mL/g) and purified water (0.3 mL/g) was then added into the solution of buntanetap base at 35–50 °C. After stirring for 30 min, methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE, 12 mL/g) was then added at 35–50 °C and stirred for another 30 min. The batch was cooled to 5–20 °C and stirred for at least 30 min. The product was isolated by filtration, washed with 1.5:1 MTBE–ethanol mixture (4.5 mL/g), and dried at 60 °C under vacuum. 2.1.2. Synthesis of Form B (Dihydrate) Buntanetap base was dissolved in ethanol (5.0 mL/g), and the solution was heated to 50 °C. A solution of D-tartaric acid (1.1 eq.) in purified water (1.6 mL/g) was then added and stirred until a solution was obtained. The solution was cooled to 28 °C and seeded with Form B (0.5% w w 2.1.3. Buntanetap Characterization The polymorph screen was performed by Triclinic Labs (Lafayette, IN, USA), which identified and characterized Form B using x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The crystal growth for XRPD analysis and interpretation was conducted by Pharmaron (Ningbo, China). The XRPD was used to determine and characterize the crystal structure of Form A and Form B [ 23 24 25 Supplementary Materials (Figure S1) The DSC analysis was carried out on a TA Instruments Q2000 Discovery Series (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) instrument [ 26 27 TGA analyses were carried out using a TA Instruments Q5500 Discovery Series instrument (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) [ 28 29 The dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) analysis was carried out using a TA Instruments Q5000 DVS analyzer (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). A sample was loaded into a metal-coated quartz pan and analyzed at 25 °C after being equilibrated to 5% relative humidity (RH) in 10% RH steps from 5 to 95% RH (adsorption cycle) and from 95 to 5% RH (desorption cycle). The movement from one step to the next occurred either after satisfying the equilibrium criterion of 0.01% weight change in 60 min or, if the equilibrium criterion was not met, after 90 min. The % weight change values were calculated in Microsoft Excel. Buntanetap crystals were visualized using polarized light microscope (PLM, ECLIPSE LV100POL, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Form A only formed micro-crystals, which had to be visualized by micro-crystal electron diffraction (MicroED) and was further used for structure determination [ 30 31 Figure S2 2.2. Animal Models 2.2.1. Mouse Male mice ( Mus musculus n Blood was collected at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after dosing. Sample volume was 0.025 mL for each time point, collected via the saphenous vein. Samples were placed into a microcentrifuge tube containing the anti-coagulant K2-EDTA and centrifuged (3200× g Figure S3 CSF was collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 12 h after dosing. Sample volume was 3 µL per time point, collected at terminal points following CO 2 Figure S3 The whole brain was collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 12 h after dosing. For each form of buntanetap, a total of 3 samples were collected at every time point ( Figure S3 2 v v For samples collected within the first hour of dosing, ±1 min was acceptable, while for all other time points, samples were taken within 5% of the scheduled time and were not considered as protocol deviations, according to the vendor’s SOP. The narrow timing deviation ensured accuracy in capturing the peak drug concentration and the early stages of drug absorption, while also maintaining consistency among samples. 2.2.2. Dog Beagle dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris n n n Figure S4 Figure S5 Dogs received a single oral dose of buntanetap (20 mg/kg) Form A or Form B in a cross-over design on study Day 1 and on study Day 15 following a 14-day washout period—one Torpac size #12 capsule per dog. Animals were weighed (mean weight = 8.47 kg) prior to dose administration on the day of dosing and fasted overnight before dosing on Day 1 and Day 15. Pre-dose concentrations on Day 15 were BQL, confirming the absence of carry-over during the washout period. Approximately 0.5 mL blood was collected at each time point (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h) via peripheral vessel from each study animal. The acceptable deviations on sampling time were ±1 min for the time points pre-dose through 1 h post-dose, and ±5% of the nominal time for time points after 1 h post-dose. Cocktail blood stabilizer was added to commercial tubes containing K2-EDTA at a blood sample ratio of 1:20 ( v v g 2.3. Human Volunteers This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles defined in the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as delineated by Title 21 CFR Parts 50, 56, and 312, and ICH guidelines and directives, and was approved by Advarra Institutional Review Board (IRB), registered with Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under IRB#00000971. Healthy subjects were used for this study to allow for assessments in the absence of confounding factors such as comorbid conditions and concomitant medications. A total of 35 healthy male and female volunteers (Form A, n n 2 Following a screening period of up to 28 days, eligible subjects were admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day-1. After an overnight fast of at least 10 h, each subject received their assigned treatment of buntanetap as a 50 mg oral capsule with approximately 240 mL (8 oz) of water. The current dose was chosen to ensure robust quantification of buntanetap and its metabolites in plasma. In this randomized, cross-over design, doses of Form A and Form B were separated by at least a 5-day washout period. Serial blood samples for PK analysis were collected from pre-dose through 24 h post-dose during each period. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and screening parameters described above at various time points during the study. The intensity of AEs was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5. Adverse events were coded using the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary (Version 25.0 or higher). 2.4. Data Analysis In animals, the concentrations of buntanetap and its N1- and N8-norbuntanetap metabolites were determined by using a validated LC-MS/MS method and subjected to a non-compartmental analysis (NCA). The linear/log trapezoidal rule was applied in obtaining the PK parameters. Individual plasma concentration values, which were below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) that appear before Tmax, were set to zero and those after Tmax were excluded from the parameter calculation. The following PK parameters were calculated: Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf. Collected data were analyzed using repeated measures mixed model analysis of variance and presented as mean values of each time point group. Descriptive statistics—sample size (n), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation expressed as a percent (%CV)—were generated. In humans, the PK of buntanetap and its metabolites in plasma was determined by NCA using Phoenix WinNonlin software (Version 8.1 or higher, Certara USA, Inc. Radnor, PA, USA) based on actual plasma sample collection time points. The following PK parameters were calculated: Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf. A sample size of 18 was used to provide approximately 85% statistical power, with a 10% discontinuation rate for the comparison of PK parameters AUC0-last and Cmax. For the power calculation, the mean and standard deviation of the AUC0-last 95.5 (36.1) and Cmax 42.5 (11.1) were based on an internal parallel study of 50 mg Form A. It is assumed that Form A and Form B study drug are equivalent, with a correlation (intrasubject variability) of 0.15 (based on FDA guidance for Phase 1 BA/BE), bioavailability ratio of 1.5, and alpha of 0.05. A mixed-effect model (on log-transformation) that includes treatment, period, and treatment sequence as fixed effect, and subject nested within treatment sequence as a random effect were used to estimate the least square means and intrasubject variance. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios of geometric mean of AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and Cmax were constructed to demonstrate the absorption and systemic exposure of each test versus reference comparison. Data are presented as means with SD. 3. Results 3.1. Buntanetap Polymorphism Buntanetap Form B was discovered during a polymorph screen [ 32 33 Figure 1 Figure S6 The two forms exhibit distinct physical properties: Form A melts at ~150.1 °C (as determined by DSC) and loses <1% of its weight before reaching its melting point, as measured by TGA ( Figure S7 3.2. Buntanetap Metabolism When metabolized, buntanetap (Form A and Form B alike) is converted into N1-norbuntanetap and N8-norbuntanetap ( Figure 2 20 3 1 2 3 3.3. Buntanetap PK in Mice We first examined the distribution of buntanetap Form A and Form B, as well as its metabolites, in mouse plasma. Form B reached a Cmax of 828 ± 192 ng/mL at Tmax 0.25 h and a systemic exposure (AUC0-last) of 1186 ng·h/mL ( Table 1 Figure 3 p N1-norbuntanetap was the least abundant metabolite, reaching a Cmax of 554 ± 275 ng/mL at Tmax 0.72 h for Form A and 468 ± 255 ng/mL at Tmax 0.25 h for Form B ( Table 1 Figure 3 In contrast, N8-norbuntanetap was the most abundant metabolite, reaching a Cmax of 1931 ± 909 ng/mL at Tmax 1.5 h for Form A and 1425 ± 309 ng/mL at Tmax 1.75 h for Form B ( Table 1 Figure 3 The Cmax ratios of metabolites to buntanetap for Form A were 0.59 ± 0.62 (N1/buntanetap) and 2.05 ± 2.04 (N8/buntanetap), and 0.56 ± 1.32 (N1/buntanetap) and 1.72 ± 1.61 (N8/buntanetap) for Form B. Next, we assessed the ability of both buntanetap forms to penetrate the CNS by measuring concentrations in CSF and brain tissue, and by calculating their respective ratios to plasma concentrations. High brain concentrations are indicative of efficient CNS penetration, enabling the drug to reach its targets and exert therapeutic effects on cognition and function. As anticipated, both forms showed substantial brain accumulation (Form A: 4737 ± 1973 ng/g; Form B: 2583 ± 239 ng/g), with brain/plasma ratios of 5.19 ± 0.625 for Form A and 4.64 ± 0.112 for Form B ( Table 2 3.4. Buntanetap PK in Dogs In this part of the study, both male and female dogs were used. Our earlier research indicated no sex-related differences in buntanetap PK [ 22 Figure S8 p t p p p p p p p p p p p p For buntanetap Form B, Cmax reached 962 ± 480 ng/mL and Tmax 0.98 ± 0.55 h while AUC0-last was 1390 ± 500 ng·h/mL ( Figure 4 p Table 3 The PK of primary metabolites was also consistent between Form A and Form B. In particular, for N1-norbuntanetap Cmax was 648 ± 151 ng/mL and 630 ± 153 ng/mL, with Tmax at 2.08 ± 0.67 h and 2.25 ± 0.87 h for Forms A and B, respectively. The AUC0-last was 2560 ± 1210 ng·h/mL for Form A and 2240 ± 636 ng·h/mL for Form B. The T1/2 was 1.48 ± 0.39 h for Form A and 1.54 ± 0.23 h for Form B. For the N8-norbuntanetap, Form A and B had Cmax values of 99.5 ± 53.6 ng/mL and 90.3 ± 56.1 ng/mL, with Tmax at 1.15 ± 0.55 h and 1.02 ± 0.5 h, respectively. The AUC0-last was 235 ± 86.5 ng·h/mL for Form A and 215 ± 80.6 ng·h/mL for Form B. The T1/2 was 2.22 ± 0.75 h for Form A and 2.21 ± 0.58 h for Form B. The Cmax ratios of metabolites to buntanetap for Form A were 0.62 ± 0.28 (N1/buntanetap) and 0.10 ± 0.09 (N8/buntanetap), and 0.65 ± 0.31 (N1/buntanetap) and 0.09 ± 0.12 (N8/buntanetap) for Form B. Distribution of plasma concentration over a 12-h window showed similar profiles between Forms A and B and their metabolites, with both being fully cleared after 12 h post-dosing ( Figure 4 p 3.5. Buntanetap PK in Humans In this part of the study, human volunteers, both male and female, received 50 mg of buntanetap followed by the plasma PK evaluation over 24 h. Overall, mean (SD) age was 39.9 (8.43) years, the range of age was 24 to 51 years, and mean (SD) BMI was 26.90 (3.040) kg/m 2 For Form B, Cmax reached 71.1 ± 42.2 ng/mL and Tmax 1.5 h while AUC0-last was 153 ± 64.3 ng·h/mL ( Figure 5 Table 4 The PK of primary metabolites in humans was consistent between the two forms. N1-norbuntanetap reached Cmax of 7.12 ± 1.84 ng/mL and 6.91 ± 2.27 ng/mL, with Tmax at 2.48 h and 2.69 h for Forms A and B, respectively. For the N8- norbuntanetap, Form A and Form B had Cmax values of 7.87 ± 2.25 ng/mL and 7.25 ± 2.53 ng/mL, with Tmax at 2.58 h and 2.89 h, respectively. Similarly, the other parameters, such as AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2 were almost equivalent between the polymorphs ( Table 4 The Cmax ratios of metabolites to buntanetap for Form A were 0.10 ± 0.05 (N1/buntanetap) and 0.12 ± 0.07 (N8/buntanetap) and 0.10 ± 0.05 (N1/buntanetap) and 0.10 ± 0.06 (N8/buntanetap) for Form B. Bioequivalence of two forms in humans was assessed over a 24-h period, revealing identical profiles. Buntanetap, which reached higher concentrations than its metabolites, was fully cleared within 8 h, while N1 and N8 were eliminated by 24 h. 4. Discussion The cross-study data presented in this manuscript provides an additional layer of understanding of structural, metabolic, and PK characteristics of buntanetap and introduces a novel crystal polymorph. Our discovery of Form B, a dihydrate of Form A, and a thorough comparative analysis of the two forms conducted in animals and humans represent a key step in adopting a crystal buntanetap in clinical studies for AD, PD, and other neurodegenerative conditions. The two forms differ in the amount of water present during the synthesis process, with Form B having two moles of water in its lattice. We have characterized the physical properties of both forms and determined—based on differences in melting points and weight loss profiles as well as crystal structure determination—that Form B is distinct from Form A, and the two do not easily interconvert. In general, crystalline compounds offer a significant advantage in pharmaceutical development, as they tend to possess higher purity and greater resistance to physical instabilities [ 34 Bioequivalence studies demonstrated that Forms A and B exhibit similar PK properties and show efficient brain penetration. Both forms rapidly reach peak plasma concentration and are completely cleared within 12 h. Moreover, measurement of brain/plasma ratios in mice demonstrated that both forms achieve ~5-fold higher concentrations in the brain than in plasma, which is explained by the drug’s affinity for lipid tissue. Buntanetap is a lipophilic molecule with a partition coefficient (LogD) 2.2, which falls in the optimal range for BBB permeability, resulting in favorable CNS distribution with higher drug concentration in the brain. These findings align with previous PK data for Form A in several animal studies (mice, rats, dogs) and humans [ 22 NCT05686044 NCT05357989 Buntanetap is metabolized into two primary metabolites: N1- and N8-norbuntanetap. Our data confirms this metabolic pathway with no notable differences in metabolite profiles between the two polymorphs. In humans, plasma concentrations of both N1 and N8 are significantly lower than those of buntanetap, and N8 shows a longer half-life than N1. Since N8 lacks the activity associated with AChE inhibition but retains the ability to inhibit neurotoxic proteins [ 5 18 20 22 35 36 Data presented in this manuscript is important for supporting the use of Form B for clinical application; however, there are several limitations worth acknowledging. First, the study had a relatively small sample size and was limited to oral administration. Increasing the number of subjects and conducting the analysis of buntanetap via intravenous (IV) administration could provide more robust data on absolute bioavailability. However, the focus was to assess and compare the PK of two forms via a clinically relevant route of administration, consistent with the drug’s use as an oral dosage form in clinical trials. Second, while the efficacy data is currently available only for Form A, which is in line with observed BBB penetration and PK data, we are still in the process of gaining such data for Form B. Hence, our extrapolation of the possible link between the observed bioequivalence of two forms and the efficacy of Form B is speculative, and more data needs to be obtained to draw a confirmative conclusion. Taken together, our findings support the selection of Form B for human clinical trials. Currently, a pivotal Phase 3 study in early AD (MMSE 21-28) is underway, in which patients receive 30 mg of buntanetap Form B, being conducted under an investigational new drug application approved by the FDA ( NCT06709014 5. Conclusions The purpose of this study was to characterize the PK of a newly discovered crystalline polymorph of buntanetap, Form B, and to demonstrate that it exhibits comparable bioequivalence to Form A. Within each species, the key PK parameters remained remarkably consistent between the two forms, as well as between the primary metabolites. These findings support Form B as a candidate for progression in future clinical trials targeting AD, PD, and other neurodegenerative conditions. 6.
