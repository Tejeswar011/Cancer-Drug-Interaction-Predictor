Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent inflammation and progressive destruction of cartilage-rich tissues. While auricular and nasal cartilage are commonly affected, isolated involvement of the trachea and main bronchi is exceedingly rare. We present the case of a 53-year-old female with low-grade fever, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. Laboratory results showed elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Imaging studies CT, MRI, and PET-CT revealed irregular thickening and stenosis of the tracheal and bronchial cartilage rings. The patient responded favorably to glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, with significant improvement noted on follow-up imaging. This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough diagnostic approach in recognizing RP with atypical respiratory involvement.

It is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and progressive destruction of cartilage in the affected regions, commonly involving the ears, nose, trachea, and costal cartilage [ [1] [2] [3] The estimated global prevalence of RP varies between 4.5 and 25 cases per million, with an annual incidence of 0.71 to 3.5 cases per million [ 2 4 5 Case presentation A 53-year-old female presented with unexplained low-grade fever persisting for over 2 weeks, with body temperature fluctuating between 37.1°C and 37.7°C. She also experienced a sore throat and intermittent cough without sputum production. There was no history of recent respiratory infections, trauma, or significant comorbidities. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.02 × 109/L, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) at 10.60 mg/dL, elevated rheumatoid factor (RF) at 88.3 IU/mL, increased serum amyloid A (SSA) at 39.75 mg/L, and elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 210.9 pg/mL. Additionally, the patient also tested positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-SSA antibodies, serological tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, Coxsackievirus group B antibodies, and tuberculosis were all negative. The unenhanced chest CT scan revealed irregular thickening of the tracheal and main bronchial cartilage rings, with sparing of the posterior membrane and accompanied by varying degrees of stenosis ( Fig. 1 D Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 C Fig. 3 Fig. 1 Unenhanced CT scan findings. (A) Thickening of the anterior and lateral wall of the upper trachea is observed, with sparing of the posterior membrane (white arrow). (B) The tracheal walls appear roughened, accompanied by peritracheal fat stranding (yellow circle). (C) Enlarged lymph nodes are noted in the mediastinum (yellow arrow) and (D) Stenosis of the right primary bronchus is evident (red arrow). Fig 1 – Fig. 2 Unenhanced MRI scan findings. (A) Axial T1 MRI scan of the chest reveals prominent circumferential isointense signal within the perichondral and chondral tissues (white arrows) and (B, C) Coronal and sagittal T2 MRI scan of the mediastinum shows generalized tracheal thickening (yellow arrows). Fig 2 – Fig. 3 PET/CT scan findings. (A) Axial CT and fused PET/CT images show increased FDG uptake in the tracheal cartilage (arrows) and enlarged lymph nodes, as well as in the bilateral primary and lobar bronchi (white arrow) and (B, C) Coronal CT, PET and fused PET/CT images reveal increased FDG uptake in the tracheal cartilage, bilateral primary and lobar bronchi (yellow and red arrows). Fig 3 – The patient was treated with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy as part of the standard regimen. Specifically, she received intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 40 mg/day for 5 consecutive days, followed by oral prednisone 30 mg/day with a gradual taper. Methotrexate (10 mg/week) was also initiated as a steroid-sparing agent. Clinical improvement (reduction of cough, throat pain, and exertional dyspnea) was noted within 2 weeks. A follow-up unenhanced chest CT at 6 weeks marked improvement in the thickening of the tracheal and bronchial cartilage rings, along with a reduction in stenosis ( Fig. 4 D Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Post-treatment Unenhanced CT scan findings. (A) Significant improvement in the thickening of the tracheal and bronchial cartilage rings is observed (white arrow). (B) The density of the surrounding adipose tissue appears clearer (yellow circle). (C) Lymph nodes are smaller compared to pretreatment measurements (yellow arrow) and (D) A reduction in the degree of stenosis of the right primary bronchus is noted (red arrow). Fig 4 – Discussion Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare, systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and progressive destruction of cartilaginous tissues. While RP most commonly affects the ears, nose and joints, involvement of the respiratory tract, particularly isolated tracheobronchial inflammation, is far less common and is associated with poorer prognosis if not treated promptly [ 2 4 Pathogenesis RP is considered an immune-mediated disease involving both humoral and cell-mediated mechanisms. Genetic predisposition is supported by HLA class II associations, most consistently HLA-DR4 [ 6 7 8 9 10 Recently, a large-scale autoantibody reactome analysis identified 14 novel autoantibodies in RP, which not only differentiated RP from healthy and disease controls but also predicted disease activity and recurrence [ 11 Clinical relevance of respiratory involvement In RP, respiratory tract involvement occurs in approximately 30-60% of cases and is often associated with more severe disease progression [ [12] [13] [14] 15 Imaging plays a crucial role in identifying airway involvement in RP. In this case, CT scans—acquired during the inspiratory phase [ 16 17 18 19 20 Diagnostic challenges and differential diagnosis RP is often misdiagnosed as other inflammatory or infectious diseases due to overlapping clinical symptoms. In this case, the patient presented with nonspecific respiratory symptoms like sore throat, cough, and low-grade fever, which mimicked common respiratory infections. Negative test results for tuberculosis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and other infectious agents further complicated the diagnostic process. Similar diagnostic challenges have been noted in pediatric cases with airway involvement, where initial symptoms are often mistaken for asthma or croup [ 21 22 22 To aid radiologic differentiation, Table 1 16 17 22 23 24 Table 1 Radiologic features of relapsing polychondritis compared with other airway-related diseases (CT and MRI). Table 1 – Disease Commonly affected sites CT imaging features MRI imaging features Calcification Lesion distribution Additional notes Relapsing polychondritis (RP) Cricoid cartilage, tracheal cartilage Symmetric thickening of the airway wall, predominantly involving the anterior and lateral walls, with posterior wall sparing; calcification is common Altered cartilage signal (T2 hyperintensity/enhancement); marked enhancement of tracheal cartilage; active chondritis in acute phase Common Symmetric MRI useful for early detection of cartilage inflammation Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) Bronchi, pulmonary vessels, small vessels Irregular airway wall thickening; may involve all airway walls; often associated with nodules, cavities, or sinus involvement Airway wall thickening, peribronchial inflammatory changes or necrosis; MRI may show perivascular edema and inflammatory lesions Rare Asymmetric Often involves multiple systems; nasal septal perforation may be present Amyloidosis Large airways (trachea/bronchi) Segmental or nodular wall thickening; extensive or focal calcification is common Variable T1/T2 signals; heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration Common Asymmetric Usually localized disease Sarcoidosis Peribronchial, hilar regions Bronchovascular bundle thickening; bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; mild airway wall thickening Enlarged lymph nodes with enhancement; peribronchial inflammatory signals; MRI can help distinguish active inflammation from fibrosis Occasional Symmetric or hilar Multisystem involvement; needs clinical/lab correlation Infectious tracheitis Trachea, bronchi Acute airway wall thickening; possible intraluminal secretions or mucus plugging Mucosal edema with T2 hyperintensity; linear mucosal enhancement in contrast MRI; typically acute and localized None Diffuse or focal Clinical signs of infection often present (e.g., fever, leukocytosis) Although unenhanced CT was sufficient in this case to identify key features of RP, contrast-enhanced imaging may provide added diagnostic value [ 25 7 22 Functional evaluation and limitations Although pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including flow-volume loops, were not performed in this case due to the urgency of airway compromise and the patient’s intolerance during the acute phase, they are considered valuable tools for assessing the functional severity of airway involvement in RP [ 1 26 27 Therapeutic approach and outcome Treatment strategies for RP with airway involvement typically ranges from symptomatic treatment to a combination of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants to control inflammation and prevent disease progression [ 28 29 30 31 Conclusion This case highlights the importance of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including advanced imaging techniques, in identifying rare manifestations of RP. Isolated tracheobronchial involvement, though uncommon, should be considered in patients with unexplained respiratory symptoms and inflammatory markers. Early diagnosis and timely immunosuppressive therapy can greatly improve outcomes by preventing irreversible airway damage. Future research should focus to explore targeted therapies, including biologics, which have shown promise in managing refractory cases of RP.
