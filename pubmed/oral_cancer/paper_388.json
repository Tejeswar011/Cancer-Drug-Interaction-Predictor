Key indicators—including prevalence, incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)—are analyzed and compared with corresponding global metrics. Methods Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database spanning 1990 to 2021, we conducted a systematic analysis of trends in the burden of lip and oral cavity cancer in China and worldwide. The average annual percent change (AAPC) was estimated using Joinpoint regression analysis to quantify the magnitude of temporal trends. Differences in cancer burden across age groups and sexes were evaluated, and the ARIMA model was employed to project future trends. Finally, we conducted a decomposition analysis to determine the percentage contribution of factors affecting the burden of lip and oral cancer. Results From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of lip and oral cavity cancer in China increased from 1.704 to 2.681 per 100,000 population, while the global ASIR rose from 4.270 to 4.880 per 100,000. The age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) in China increased from 4.168 to 10.158 per 100,000, compared to a rise from 13.888 to 17.706 per 100,000 globally. The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) in China declined from 1.224 to 1.152 per 100,000, while the global ASMR decreased slightly from 2.454 to 2.424 per 100,000. The age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) in China fell from 32.086 to 29.205 per 100,000, whereas the global ASDR decreased from 69.266 to 67.714 per 100,000. Between 1990 and 2021, the average annual percent changes (AAPCs) in China were 1.487% for ASIR, 2.899% for ASPR, − 0.187% for ASMR, and − 0.319% for ASDR. In comparison, the corresponding global AAPCs were 0.443%, 0.796%, − 0.029%, and − 0.072%, respectively. Age and sex had a significant impact on the burden of lip and oral cavity cancer, with males consistently exhibiting higher incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs than females. Projections for the next 15 years indicate that the ASIR and ASMR in China will likely stabilize, while the ASPR and ASDR are expected to continue increasing. Globally, the ASMR and ASDR are projected to remain stable, whereas the ASIR and ASPR are anticipated to rise. The decomposition analyses revealed that both population aging and population increase factors exacerbated the burden of lip and oral cancer, whereas epidemiologic changes promoted the number of lip and oral cavity cancer cases but suppressed the increase in the number of deaths and DALYs. Conclusion From 1990 to 2021, the incidence and prevalence rates of lip and oral cavity cancer increased in both China and globally, while mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) experienced a slight decline. The burden of the disease was strongly associated with sex and age, with males exhibiting significantly higher incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates than females, and older adults demonstrating substantially higher rates compared to younger age groups. Over the next 15 years, the prevalence and DALY burden in China are projected to increase, while global incidence and prevalence are also expected to rise. Given China’s rapidly aging population, these findings highlight growing public health challenges that call for sustained, coordinated efforts to mitigate the future burden.

According to the Global Cancer Statistics Report 2022, the incidence of lip and oral cancer in men is significantly higher, especially in developing countries, reaching 10.2 cases per 100,000 people, which is the third highest among all cancers in these regions [ 4 5 6 Based on predictive analyses using data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, the global burden of lip and oral cavity cancer is expected to continue to rise over the next 30 years [ 7 8 9 Based on the latest GBD data in 2021, this study comprehensively analyzes and compares the burden of lip and oral cancer in China and globally from 1990 to 2021, conducts decomposition analyses to quantify the relative contribution of factors such as population aging and population growth to the overall increase in the burden of lip and oral cavity cancer, and predicts the trend of the burden of lip and oral cancer in China and globally in the next 15 years. By analyzing data from the GBD database, we aim to target early screening for lip and oral cavity cancer in high-risk populations, carry out etiologic prevention efforts, and reduce the burden of disease. Methods Data collection This study is based on the most recent data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, which provides estimates of incidence, prevalence, and mortality for nearly 300 diseases and injuries across more than 200 countries and territories [ 10 11 10 12 13 https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/).W Statistical analysis We extracted data on the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs of lip and oral cavity cancer in China and globally from the GBD database. The data included age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR), as well as crude incidence rate (CIR), crude prevalence rate (CPR), crude mortality rate (CMR), and crude DALY rate (CDR) for each age group. To explore temporal trends and assess changes in disease burden over the past three decades, we used Joinpoint regression analysis to identify statistically significant changes in trend direction or intensity. This method segments the time series data and calculates the average annual percent change (AAPC) for each linear segment, along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), using Joinpoint software developed by the National Cancer Institute (Rockville, Maryland, USA) [ 14 11 15 The 95% CI for the GBD burden of disease indicators used in this study were calculated by the Bayesian multilevel regression model DisMod-MR 2.1 developed by IHME [ 13 16 17 We adopted a previously published method to decompose the changes in the lip and oral cavity cancer population into three population-level factors—population growth, population aging, and epidemiological changes—in order to evaluate the contribution of each factor to the overall change [ 18 All data analysis and visualization were performed using R statistical software (version 4.3.3) and Joinpoint software (version 5.1.00). A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Lip and oral cavity cancer incidence in China and globally The number of lip and oral cavity cancer cases in China increased from 14,687 (95% CI: 12,390–16,909) in 1990 to 56,359 (95% CI: 45,178–69,804) in 2021, representing a cumulative increase of 283.730%. Globally, cases rose from 174,077 (95% CI: 167,404–181,622) to 421,577 (95% CI: 389,879–449,782) over the same period, marking a cumulative increase of 142.180%. In China, the ASIR increased from 1.704 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 1.453–1.949) in 1990 to 2.681 per 100,000 (95% CI: 2.150–3.303) in 2021. Globally, the ASIR rose from 4.270 per 100,000 (95% CI: 4.098–4.451) to 4.880 per 100,000 (95% CI: 4.519–5.205) during the same period. Between 1990 and 2021, the AAPC in the incidence rate of lip and oral cavity cancer was 1.487% (95% CI: 1.330–1.644) in China and 0.443% (95% CI: 0.374–0.511) globally (see Table 1 Table 1 All-age lip and oral cavity cancer cases, age-standardized incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs for China and global with AAPC from 1990 to 2021 Location Measure 1990 2021 All ages Age-standardized All ages Age-standardized 1990–2021 AAPC n(95%CI) n(95%CI) n(95%CI) n(95%CI) n(95%CI) Lip and oral cavity cancer China Incidence 14,687 (12390–16909) 1.704 (1.453–1.949) 56,359 (45178–69804) 2.681 (2.150–3.303) 1.487% (1.330–1.644) Prevalence 39,988 (33668–46304) 4.168 (3.522–4.815) 215,166 (172154–264252) 10.158 (8.164–12.408) 2.899% (2.793–3.005) Deaths 9857 (8346–11340) 1.224 (1.050–1.401) 23,882 (18972–29681) 1.152 (0.923–1.415) −0.187% (−0.437-0.064) DALYs 295,390 (247607–342342) 32.086 (27.036–37.005) 618,016 (487509–777184) 29.205 (23.182–36.493) −0.319% (−0.480- −0.158) Global Incidence 174,077 (167404–181622) 4.270 (4.098–4.451) 421,577 (389879–449782) 4.880 (4.519–5.205) 0.443% (0.374–0.511) Prevalence 587,479 (568848–605472) 13.888 (13.436–14.307) 1,538,008 (1435014–1633910) 17.706 (16.518–18.806) 0.796% (0.694–0.898) Deaths 97,402 (92506–102361) 2.454 (2.329–2.581) 208,379 (191288–224162) 2.424 (2.227–2.604) −0.029% (−0.143-0.085) DALYs 2,936,205 (2793741–3092058) 69.266 (65.921–72.955) 5,874,070 (5326986–6347557) 67.714 (61.322–73.174) −0.072% (−0.153–0.010) DALYs Lip and oral cavity cancer prevalence in China and globally The number of prevalent cases of lip and oral cavity cancer in China increased from 39,988 (95% CI: 33,668–46,304) in 1990 to 215,166 (95% CI: 172,154–264,252) in 2021, representing a cumulative increase of 438.080%. Globally, the number of prevalent cases rose from 587,479 (95% CI: 568,848–605,472) in 1990 to 1,538,008 (95% CI: 1,435,014–1,633,910) in 2021, reflecting a cumulative increase of 161.800%. In China, the ASPR increased from 4.168 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 3.552–4.815) in 1990 to 10.158 per 100,000 (95% CI: 8.164–12.408) in 2021. Globally, the ASPR rose from 13.888 per 100,000 (95% CI: 13.436–14.307) to 17.706 per 100,000 (95% CI: 16.518–18.806) during the same period. From 1990 to 2021, the AAPC in the prevalence rate of lip and oral cavity cancer was 2.899% (95% CI: 2.793–3.005) in China and 0.796% (95% CI: 0.694–0.898) globally (see Table 1 Lip and oral cavity cancer mortality in China and globally The number of deaths from lip and oral cavity cancer in China increased from 9,857 (95% CI: 8,346–11,340) in 1990 to 23,882 (95% CI: 18,972–29,681) in 2021, representing a cumulative increase of 142.280%. Globally, the number of deaths rose from 97,402 (95% CI: 92,506–102,361) in 1990 to 208,379 (95% CI: 191,288–224,162) in 2021, marking a cumulative increase of 113.940%. In China, the ASMR declined from 1.224 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 1.050–1.401) in 1990 to 1.152 per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.923–1.415) in 2021. Similarly, the global ASMR decreased from 2.454 per 100,000 (95% CI: 2.329–2.581) in 1990 to 2.424 per 100,000 (95% CI: 2.227–2.604) in 2021. From 1990 to 2021, the AAPC in the mortality rate of lip and oral cavity cancer was − 0.187% (95% CI: − 0.437 to 0.064) in China and − 0.029% (95% CI: − 0.143 to 0.085) globally. Although the AAPC in ASMR were not statistically significant, they reflect a relatively stable mortality trend over time. This stability, when juxtaposed with the marked increase in absolute death counts, underscores the growing impact of demographic shifts such as population aging, thereby justifying inclusion of these trends despite the lack of statistical significance (see Table 1 Lip and oral cavity cancer-related dalys in China and globally In China, the DALYs attributable to lip and oral cavity cancer increased from 295,390 (95% CI: 247,607–342,342) in 1990 to 618,016 (95% CI: 487,509–777,184) in 2021, representing a cumulative increase of 109.220%. Globally, DALYs related to lip and oral cavity cancer rose from 2,936,025 (95% CI: 2,793,741–3,092,058) in 1990 to 5,874,070 (95% CI: 5,326,986–6,347,557) in 2021, reflecting a cumulative increase of 100.070%. In China, the ASDR declined from 32.086 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 27.036–37.005) in 1990 to 29.025 per 100,000 (95% CI: 23.182–36.493) in 2021. Globally, the ASDR decreased from 69.266 per 100,000 (95% CI: 65.921–72.955) in 1990 to 67.714 per 100,000 (95% CI: 61.322–73.174) in 2021. From 1990 to 2021, the AAPC in DALYs due to lip and oral cavity cancer was − 0.319% (95% CI: − 0.480 to − 0.158) in China, indicating a statistically significant decline, whereas − 0.072% (95% CI: − 0.153 to 0.010) in global, suggesting a non-significant but nearly stable trend. Despite the lack of statistical significance, we retained the global AAPC result to highlight the epidemiological reality that absolute DALYs are rising substantially even as rates remain steady, underscoring the global public health challenge posed by demographic transitions (see Table 1 Joinpoint regression analysis of lip and oral cavity cancer in China and globally Figure 1 Fig. 1 Annual Percentage Change in Age-Standardized Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer Burden in China and Global from 1990 to 2021.

It is important to emphasize that although the original number of cases and crude rate of lip and oral cancers have changed significantly over the past three decades, this trend may partly reflect underlying demographic changes, including population growth and aging, especially in China. To address this issue, we highlight age-standardized rates (ASRs) to ensure comparability over time and between regions. These metrics better reflect true changes in disease risk over time. Additionally, we projected trends in age-standardized rates for the next 15 years. We examined variations in the disease burden across different age and sex groups in both China and the global population. The findings revealed that the burden of lip and oral cavity cancer was found to be strongly associated with both age and sex. The disease was more prevalent among middle-aged and older adults, with incidence and prevalence rates particularly high in the elderly. Moreover, age-standardized rates for all indicators were consistently higher in males than in females, suggesting that men not only have a higher risk of developing lip and oral cavity cancer, but also face a greater risk of mortality once diagnosed. Specifically, for lip and oral cavity cancer, both China and the global population experienced a significant increase in the number of cases between 1990 and 2021, accompanied by a rising trend in the ASIR. This indicates that greater efforts are still needed in the areas of disease prevention and incidence control. These increases may reflect the influence of population aging and other risk factors [ 20 21 22 23 In addition, China is one of the world’s leading producers and consumers of betel nut, which has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen—on par with tobacco and alcohol—by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). It should be mentioned that there have been studies analyzing the proportion of disease burden attributable to key modifiable risk factors (e.g., tobacco use, alcohol, betel quid chewing), which are available in the GBD dataset [ 24 25 26 27 The Global strategy and action plan on oral health 2023–2030 28 Although the absolute number of deaths and DALYs due to lip and oral cavity cancer increased in both China and globally between 1990 and 2021, China’s ASMR showed a decreasing trend, while the global ASMR remained relatively stable. Moreover, both China and the global population exhibited an overall decline in ASDR. These findings reflect substantial progress in healthcare systems and advancements in the treatment of lip and oral cavity cancer over the past three decades. The downward trends in ASMR and DALYs were more pronounced in China than globally, highlighting notable improvements in cancer management and rehabilitation in China. Between 1995 and 2007, China experienced the most significant declines in ASMR and ASDR, which coincided with the introduction of comprehensive, multimodal treatment concepts and advances in surgical techniques such as flap reconstruction and microvascular surgery [ 29 30 32 33 34 35 This study examined changes in the burden of lip and oral cavity cancer among different age groups in China and globally from 1990 to 2021. The results revealed increasing trends in CIR and CPR among middle-aged and older adults in both China and the global population, while the CMR remained relatively stable across all age groups. In China, the CDR showed a decreasing trend among older age groups, whereas it remained stable globally. When comparing China with global trends, the increases in CIR and CPR were more pronounced in China, suggesting a potential shift toward a younger age of onset for lip and oral cavity cancer. This trend may be linked to the rising prevalence of modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption [ 36 37 38 18 39 Both in China and globally, the burden of lip and oral cavity cancer exhibits significant variation across time periods and age groups. Across all indicators, males consistently show higher age-standardized rates than females. A likely explanation is the higher prevalence of exposure to known risk factors—such as excessive alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and betel quid chewing—among men compared to women [ 40 41 40 Socioeconomic disparities have a significant impact on cancer outcomes, especially in the Chinese context where urban-rural disparities are prominent. Studies have shown that patients from rural areas or with lower income and education levels often have difficulty in obtaining timely early diagnosis, standardized treatment, and comprehensive management, resulting in poorer survival outcomes and a higher burden of disease [ 42 Over the next 15 years, both China and the global community are expected to face challenges associated with the burden of lip and oral cavity cancer. The first thing to emphasize is that forecasts are sensitive to model assumptions and may not be able to account for future interventions or unforeseen disturbances (e.g., pandemics, policy shifts). Forecasting results indicate that China’s ASIR will remain stable, in contrast to a projected upward trend in global ASIR. This suggests that China’s public health interventions have achieved certain successes, offering valuable insights that may be applicable in other countries. With continued advances in clinical techniques and the ongoing development of novel therapeutics, both China and the global population are expected to maintain relatively stable ASMR, which in turn is likely to contribute to improved survival outcomes for patients. As a result, the ASPR is projected to increase in both China and globally, highlighting a growing need for postoperative rehabilitation and long-term management of lip and oral cavity cancer patients. In China, the ASDR is expected to rise from 2021 to 2030, and then stabilize between 2031 and 2035, whereas the global ASDR is projected to remain relatively stable throughout the 15-year forecast period. This suggests that there is still room for improvement in China’s postoperative care and rehabilitation services, especially in comparison to international standards. To effectively address the anticipated increase in the number of survivors of lip and oral cavity cancer, China’s public health system must strengthen efforts in disease surveillance, prevention, clinical care, and rehabilitation. Enhancing these components will be essential to manage the growing burden and ensure sustainable outcomes in the face of this evolving public health challenge. However, this study has several limitations. The GBD analysis relies heavily on the quality and availability of data in public databases, including diagnostic and evaluation data for lip and oral cavity cancer. In regions with limited healthcare resources and among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underdiagnosis may lead to underestimation of the true burden of disease. Additionally, this study used global estimates of the burden of lip and oral cavity cancer as a reference to compare with China’s data. However, regional differences in disease burden are influenced by a range of factors, including ethnicity, socioeconomic development, and disparities in access to healthcare. Therefore, global burden data may not accurately reflect the specific situation in individual countries or regions. Further analyses based on country- or region-specific data are needed to provide more precise insights. In addition, the Joinpoint regression model assumes that trends change at certain breakpoints and vary linearly across segments, which may not capture nonlinear or irregular fluctuations. Similarly, the ARIMA model relies on the smoothness of the time series (or its transformation), which limits its ability to model sudden epidemiological changes, such as events like major health policy reforms, epidemic outbreaks, or mass screening. The above modeling assumptions may lead to overestimation or underestimation of future trends and should be taken into account when interpreting forecast results. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that over the 30-year study period, diagnostic capabilities, disease classification standards, and cancer surveillance systems have evolved considerably. Improvements in health infrastructure and awareness may have led to increased case ascertainment and reporting, particularly in middle and low-income regions such as rural China. This phenomenon, often referred to as“diagnostic drift,”may partially cause the upward trends in reported incidence and prevalence. Despite these limitations, the present study provides valuable evidence to enhance public understanding of the trends in lip and oral cavity cancer burden and highlights the need for more targeted and context-specific interventions to effectively address the growing challenges posed by this disease. Conclusion In summary, this study provides a comprehensive analysis, comparison, and evaluation of the trends in ASIR, ASPR, ASMR, and ASDR of lip and oral cavity cancer in China and globally from 1990 to 2021, as well as projections for the next 15 years. This research is intended to support policymakers by providing data-driven insights for designing effective health interventions and optimizing the allocation of health resources—both in China and globally—to address the growing burden of lip and oral cavity cancer. Relevant future research should further refine burden of disease estimates at the sub-national level to identify geographic differences in risk factor exposure and health outcomes. This will facilitate the development of more targeted prevention and intervention measures. In addition, evaluating the actual effectiveness of existing cancer prevention strategies is particularly critical for policy optimization. Longitudinal cohort studies of high-risk populations should also be conducted to clarify etiologic pathways and to monitor the long-term effectiveness of interventions. Combining epidemiologic studies with implementation science is a key way to reduce the disease burden of lip and oral cancer in China and other high-prevalence regions in the future.
