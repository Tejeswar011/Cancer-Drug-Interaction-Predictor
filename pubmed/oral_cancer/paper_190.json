The present review included the research studies which explored gellan gum based in-situ gel for intranasal drug delivery. Results The findings have shown enhanced biavailability of various drugs upon intranasal administration using gellan-gum based in-situ hydrogel.Moreover, the review indicated that intranasal administration of in-situ hydrogel facilitate to overcome blood brain barrier effectively. Hence, significantly higher drug concentration was found to be achieved in brain tissues upon intranasal administration than that of other routes like oral and intravenous. Conclusion The present work conducted a comprehensive review for gellan gum based in-situ hydrogel particularly for intransal administration to overcome BBB. The study concluded that gellan gum based in-situ hydrogel could be potential promising delivery system for intranasal administration to improve bioavailability and efficacy of drugs specifically to treat neurological disorders.
