Recent research has highlighted the critical role of gut microbiota in influencing brain health, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammation. In the context of brain tumors, especially gliomas, the gut–brain axis plays a significant role in tumor development, progression, and response to therapy. Gut dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance in microbiota composition, has been linked to chronic inflammation, immune suppression, and altered blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, key factors in glioma pathogenesis. Gut-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and neurotransmitters can either promote or inhibit tumor growth, impacting the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune responses. Emerging evidence suggests that microbiome modulation, through strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions, may enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve the efficacy of conventional treatments like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. This review examines the interactions between gut microbiota and brain tumors, focusing on how microbiota alterations may influence tumor biology and therapeutic outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms of the gut–brain axis could lead to novel adjunctive therapies in neuro-oncology, offering new prospects for personalized treatment strategies in brain tumor management. gut–brain axis microbiota brain tumors glioblastoma therapy This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The gut–brain axis is a bidirectional communication network linking the gastrointestinal (GI) system and the central nervous system (CNS) through neural, endocrine, and immune pathways [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 8 9 10 2. A Comprehensive Overview of Brain Tumors: From Astrocytomas to Meningiomas Brain tumors constitute a highly heterogeneous group of neoplasms that differ widely in their cellular origin, biological behavior, and clinical outcomes [ 11 12 13 14 The landmark 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification introduced molecular markers, particularly IDH mutations and 1p/19q-codeletion status, establishing a more reliable and prognostically meaningful framework. Later, the 2021 revision further advanced this approach by fully integrating molecular diagnostics, including tools such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), next-generation sequencing (NGS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), PCR-based mutation analysis, and methylation profiling, thereby improving both the accuracy of glioma classification and its value for therapeutic decision-making [ 14 15 From a biological perspective, glial tumors originate from cells of glial lineage and remain the most common primary brain tumors. They are traditionally categorized into low- and high-grade lesions based on their growth pattern and clinical behavior. Low-grade gliomas, including pilocytic astrocytoma (Grade I) and diffuse astrocytoma (Grade II), are generally slow-growing and associated with a more favorable prognosis. In contrast, high-grade gliomas, such as anaplastic astrocytoma (Grade III) and GBM (Grade IV), display rapid growth, aggressive biological behavior, and poorer prognosis [ 11 16 4 11 17 18 14 Table 1 In summary, the epidemiological landscape of brain tumors reveals a complex picture where the overall incidence and mortality are driven by the highly aggressive nature of astrocytoma, especially in the context of GBMs [ 19 2.1. Astrocytomas Astrocytomas are primary brain tumors arising from astrocytes, a type of glial cell [ 11 11 20 11 11 2.1.1. Non-Glioblastoma Astrocytomas Non-glioblastoma astrocytomas, which primarily encompass Grade II (diffuse astrocytomas) and Grade III (anaplastic astrocytomas), represent a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors with a variable clinical course. Epidemiologically, these tumors have a lower incidence compared to GBMs [ 16 The integration of molecular profiling into the diagnostic process has significantly refined the classification and prognostication of non-glioblastoma astrocytomas. Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH IDH1 IDH2 21 22 23 TP53 ATRX 24 25 The natural history of these tumors is indolent initially, yet there is a considerable risk for progression, particularly in Grade III lesions, which tend to have a more aggressive clinical course. For low-grade astrocytomas, a combination of careful observation, radiotherapy, and, in some cases, chemotherapy (e.g., TMZ) may be employed, particularly if complete resection is not achievable [ 26 Long-term follow-up is essential for these patients due to the risk of recurrence and progression. Advances in neuroimaging, molecular diagnostics, and surgical techniques continue to improve the management and outcomes of non-glioblastoma astrocytomas, although challenges remain in predicting individual tumor behavior and response to therapy. 2.1.2. Glioblastoma GBM is recognized as the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, classified as a Grade IV astrocytoma [ 4 17 27 One of the most frequently encountered genetic alterations in GBM is the amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR 28 29 III EGFR Another critical genetic alteration involves the tumor suppressor gene PTEN PTEN 30 31 TP53 TP53 32 Mutations in the promoter region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase TERT 16 Furthermore, although less common than in lower-grade gliomas, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH IDH 21 Other notable mutations include alterations in genes such as NF1 33 The current standard of care for GBM involves maximally safe surgical resection followed by a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, typically with TMZ. However, despite these treatments, the median overall survival for patients remains dismal [ 17 34 Given the profound molecular heterogeneity and the adaptive resistance of GBM to current treatment strategies, there is a critical need for further studies. Future research must focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms by which these genetic alterations drive tumor progression and therapy resistance. In parallel, novel combination therapies that integrate targeted agents, immunotherapies, and conventional treatments should be explored to improve patient outcomes. Ultimately, a more personalized approach to GBM management, guided by comprehensive molecular profiling, will be essential to develop more effective, individualized treatment regimens for this formidable malignancy. In conclusion, GBM’s dismal prognosis is a consequence of its aggressive histopathological features compounded by a complex array of molecular mutations, including EGFR PTEN TP53 TERT IDH 2.2. Meningioma Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, originating from the arachnoid cap cells of the meninges [ 35 36 37 38 Meningiomas are often discovered incidentally during neuroimaging performed for unrelated reasons due to their typically indolent nature [ 39 39 Recent advancements in molecular diagnostics have shed light on the genetic alterations underlying meningioma pathogenesis. Mutations in the neurofibromin 2 NF2 40 41 SMO AKT1 TRAF7 KLF4 42 The primary treatment for symptomatic meningiomas remains surgical resection, which is often curative for benign lesions [ 43 43 Immunotherapeutic approaches are also emerging as potential adjuncts in treating high-grade or recurrent meningiomas, although these strategies are still in the early stages of clinical evaluation [ 44 The integration of molecular profiling into routine clinical practice holds promise for refining the classification and management of meningiomas [ 14 45 14 Ongoing research is essential to address the intrinsic heterogeneity of these tumors and to translate molecular discoveries into effective treatments. 2.3. Pediatric Brain Tumors Pediatric brain tumors represent a distinct category of CNS neoplasms, differing significantly from adult brain tumors in terms of histology, molecular profile, clinical behavior, and treatment response [ 46 47 SMARCB1 H3K27M 48 49 The clinical course of pediatric brain tumors also differs from adults: low-grade tumors, such as pilocytic astrocytomas, may have excellent long-term survival with complete resection, whereas high-grade tumors, including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, carry a very poor prognosis despite aggressive therapy [ 50 51 Overall, pediatric brain tumors require a multidisciplinary approach integrating neuroimaging, molecular diagnostics, and individualized treatment planning, highlighting the importance of understanding tumor biology. 3. Gut–Brain Axis: A Complex Communication Network The gut–brain axis is an intricate and multifaceted communication network that links the gut and the brain [ 52 53 52 53 1 2 54 Effects of Gut Microbiota on Brain Health Recent research has explained the profound influence that gut microbiota exerts on brain health [ 2 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 61 62 Moreover, studies have shown that an imbalance in gut microbial communities, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the development of neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [ 3 63 64 65 Figure 1 Inflammatory responses triggered by an imbalanced gut microbiota are believed to contribute to brain inflammation, which can exacerbate neurodegenerative processes. The interaction between gut-derived inflammatory mediators and the brain’s immune system can lead to chronic low-grade inflammation, which is often observed in conditions like AD and PD. In the context of AD, a systematic review conducted by Manfredi et al. [ 66 Firmicutes Bifidobacteria Proteobacteria 66 n n 67 Firmicutes Bifidobacteria Bacteroides Firmicutes Bacteroidetes 67 Firmicutes Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Bifidobacteria 67 As mentioned earlier, the gut microbiota can influence the integrity of the BBB, which controls the entry of substances into the brain [ 7 7 7 7 The gut microbiota also has a direct role in regulating the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which in turn controls several functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiratory rate. By influencing the ANS, the gut microbiome can affect not just brain function but also the physical aspects of brain health, such as blood flow and cellular repair mechanisms [ 68 62 69 Given the significant effects of the gut microbiota on brain health, researchers are exploring probiotic and prebiotic therapies to promote a healthy gut microbiota as potential treatments for various neurological and psychological conditions. Probiotics, which are live beneficial bacteria, and prebiotics, which are compounds that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, are being tested for their ability to restore balance to the gut microbiota and alleviate symptoms of mental health disorders [ 62 69 70 62 71 72 73 73 In addition to diet, recent studies are investigating the use of FMT as a potential treatment for restoring gut health in certain neurological conditions [ 9 65 74 While microbiota-based therapies hold promise, their effectiveness ultimately depends on the molecular pathways by which gut microbes shape brain function, many of which converge on key immune and inflammatory signaling cascades and are promising for the development of future treatments. For instance, emerging evidence supports a central role for the NLRP3 inflammasome as a molecular hub in the gut-microbiota–brain axis, mediating the bidirectional crosstalk between dysbiosis and neuroinflammation [ 75 76 Once activated, the NLRP3 inflammasome assembles a complex with ASC and pro-caspase-1, leading to caspase-1 cleavage and maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, culminating in neuroinflammation and pyroptotic cell death, which exacerbate BBB disruption and neuronal injury [ 77 This activation loop is further compounded by gut dysbiosis: in animal models, NLRP3 knockout or caspase-1 deficiency alters microbiota composition, behavioral outcomes, and gut motility, underscoring a mutual regulatory feedback loop between microbiota and the inflammasome [ 78 In pathological contexts such as AD, PD, major depressive disorder (MDD), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), microbiota-driven activation of NLRP3 promotes peripheral and central inflammation, compromises gut barrier integrity, and leads to white matter injury and neurodegeneration [ 79 Notably, in models of ICH, dysbiosis-induced NLRP3 activation mediates secondary injury by disrupting the BBB, inducing neuroinflammation, and hindering nerve regeneration [ 80 6 Collectively, current evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis may drive NLRP3 over-activation, fostering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn may further alter gut microbial composition, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle of dysbiosis and neuroinflammation [ 81 As the understanding of the gut–brain connection deepens, researchers continue to explore novel ways to leverage the gut microbiome in the treatment and prevention of a wide range of neurological and psychological disorders. The emerging field of microbiome-based medicine may offer new hope for improving brain health. 4. The Role of Gut Microbiota in Brain Tumor Development, Progression, and Treatment Recent research into the gut–brain axis has opened up new avenues for understanding how the gut microbiota, the complex community of microorganisms residing in the GI tract, can influence brain health [ 62 82 83 56 84 Table 2 Brain tumors, particularly gliomas, are one of the most devastating types of cancer, with a high mortality rate and limited treatment options [ 11 Figure 2 4.1. Gut Microbiota and Brain Tumor Development The interplay between gut microbiota, inflammatory state and brain tumor development is complex and multifactorial [ 2 82 2 8 85 88 89 2 90 82 91 92 93 72 93 94 95 96 4.2. Gut Microbiota and Brain Tumor Progression Once a brain tumor has developed, the role of the gut microbiota in tumor progression becomes even more pronounced. The gut microbiota can impact tumor growth, metastasis, and the immune landscape of the brain TME through several mechanisms [ 84 97 89 98 99 100 101 Bifidobacterium Akkermansia 5 56 86 93 102 103 4.3. Gut Microbiota and Brain Tumor Treatment The influence of the gut microbiota on brain tumor treatment is an emerging area of research with significant implications for therapeutic strategies. Traditional treatments for brain tumors, such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, have limited success due to the BBB and the complexity of the TME [ 104 The gut microbiota contributes to human health through multiple mechanisms, such as the digestion of complex carbohydrates, modulation of nutrient absorption, secretion of microbial metabolites (e.g., SCFAs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), and the production of vitamins and neurotransmitters [ 105 106 In the oncological context, alterations in gut microbiota composition have been shown to influence tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes [ 2 10 87 107 108 Notably, previous studies have suggested an association between commensal gut microbe’s alterations and brain tumors, including GBM [ 96 109 109 Ruminococcaceae 110 Probiotics, particularly those containing Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium 70 111 112 A study by Wang et al. [ 88 Bifidobacterium lactis Lactobacillus plantarum Among the most promising avenues of investigation is the role of the gut microbiota in enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies for brain tumors [ 87 107 By modulating innate and adaptive immune responses through metabolite production and other regulatory pathways, the microbiota has been shown to influence the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and related therapies [ 2 For example, Dees and colleagues [ 113 In detail, fecal material from five healthy human donors was transplanted into gnotobiotic mice [ 113 113 Bacteroides cellulosilyticus 113 Commensal bacteria shape both innate and adaptive immunity, with microbial metabolites such as SCFAs, which in turn modulate inflammatory pathways and immune cell recruitment [ 103 SCFAs, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers. SCFAs are known to exert beneficial effects in the context of neuroinflammatory diseases [ 62 69 114 115 116 117 72 106 118 Among SCFAs, butyrate accounts for approximately 20% of the total SCFAs in the gut and plays key roles in energy supply to intestinal epithelial cells, as well as in cellular regulation, proliferation, and differentiation [ 106 Firmicutes Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes Fusobacteria Proteobacteria 119 56 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria 56 56 Table 3 Another crucial mediator involved in the gut–brain axis is LPS, a pro-inflammatory endotoxin derived from Gram-negative bacteria, that can trigger systemic inflammation by activating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [ 120 121 122 121 123 124 125 126 127 In recent years, cancer vaccines are an emerging and rapidly evolving area in immuno-oncology, aiming to stimulate the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumor cells by presenting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) [ 128 128 129 + + 130 + + 128 131 Another strategy includes PVSRIPO, a genetically modified, nonpathogenic poliovirus engineered to target CD155, a receptor commonly overexpressed in GBM cells. Upon direct intratumoral administration, PVSRIPO selectively infects and lyses tumor cells, while simultaneously activating strong local and systemic immune responses. This virotherapy not only exerts direct cytotoxicity but also acts as an in situ vaccine by releasing tumor antigens and promoting immune activation [ 132 The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a critical modulator of therapeutic outcomes. Microbiome-based interventions, such as targeted probiotics, may further enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccines by shaping systemic and intratumoral immunity. As research continues to uncover the complex interplay between the microbiota, the immune system, and tumor biology, microbiota-informed vaccine strategies may open new therapeutic avenues for GBM. 5. Studies on the Influence of Microbiota in Brain Tumors The burgeoning field of microbiota research has led to an increasing focus on the gut–brain axis, particularly its role in influencing brain tumor development, progression, and treatment. A growing body of studies has started to unravel the intricate relationship between gut microbiota and brain tumors, particularly gliomas, which are among the most aggressive types of brain cancers [ 2 8 2 8 8 2 As previously explained, the gut microbiome is essential in neurogenesis processes. Alterations in microbial constituents could promote inflammation and immunosuppression. Recently, in immune-oncology, specific microbial taxa have been described to enhance the effects of therapeutic treatment. In this context, Patrizz et al. [ 85 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Akkermansia While preclinical studies have provided compelling evidence of the gut microbiota’s influence on brain tumor biology, translating these findings to human patients is an essential next step in determining the clinical relevance of microbiome modulation in brain cancer treatment. A growing body of evidence suggests that the microbiota’s influence extends beyond just the immune system, potentially affecting cancer cell metabolism, inflammation, and the BBB that can ultimately alter treatment outcomes. While these early clinical findings are promising, more large-scale, randomized clinical trials are needed to definitively establish the role of the microbiota in brain tumor treatment. 6. Conclusions and Future Perspectives In conclusion, the gut microbiota plays a significant role in the development, progression, and treatment of brain tumors. By influencing immune responses, tumor metabolism, and the response to therapies, the microbiota can either promote or inhibit tumor growth. As research into the gut–brain axis continues to unfold, it is becoming increasingly clear that microbial communities in the gut are integral to brain tumor biology. One of the most promising future directions could involve the potential use of the gut microbiota as a diagnostic tool for brain tumors. For instance, changes in the diversity and composition of gut bacteria may precede the onset of brain tumors, and specific microbial profiles could be linked to the presence of tumors or the stage of tumor progression. Advances in metagenomics and microbiome sequencing techniques could enable clinicians to identify these microbial markers and offer personalized, early detection methods for high-risk individuals. Moreover, by analyzing the patient’s unique gut microbiome composition, it may be possible to customize treatment plans that consider the microbial influence on tumor response.
