Since the beginning of the pandemic there have responses and strategies implemented to maintain the public safety of communities affected by SARS-CoV-2. This study is a unique opportunity to analyze nearly four years of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) data, obtained from five different laboratories, combined with four years of human health data from three adjacent regions of a large urban community (Miami-Dade County). The objective of this study was to analyze that data and evaluate longitudinal and geographic trends of SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater (WW) during the extensive time frame of this study. Additionally, WBS data were analyzed for multiple targets (influenza A/B, norovirus, RSV, HMPV, PMMoV) other than SARS-CoV-2 to assess the potential for expanding WBS to a wider range of targets. We found that SARS-CoV-2 levels correlated strongest with clinical positivity rates across all three geographic regions (Spearman r=0.81 for the entire period of record), with the most geographically restricted region showing higher correlations (South, r=0.86) than the region with populations with higher geographic mobility (North, r=0.69). Stronger correlations (0.80<r<0.97) were observed when correlations were established by variant waves rather than single or multiple year time frames (0.73<r<0.88). When analyzing the data for targets beyond SARS-CoV-2, results show promise as two laboratories detected norovirus, influenza A/B, RSV, and HMPV at statistically not different frequencies (Chi-squared≥0.6). Overall, results suggest that the clinical metrics used (e.g., positivity), geography, and the time frames of data analyses influence the ability of WBS to predict disease prevalence in a community. The consistency among the laboratories supports that the measurement of a wider range of viral targets can be disaggregated among different laboratories providing flexibility for building national-level WBS programs.
