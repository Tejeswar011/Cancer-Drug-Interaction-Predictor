Children often present with more extensive and aggressive disease, creating unique diagnostic and management challenges that differ significantly from adult-onset IBD. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on pediatric IBD, highlighting historical challenges while exploring emerging frontiers in diagnosis, treatment, and long-term care strategies. A narrative synthesis of global and regional epidemiological data, clinical classifications, diagnostic advancements, management approaches, and psychosocial considerations was conducted, with a particular emphasis on innovations in precision medicine, microbiome-targeted therapy, and multidisciplinary care models. Pediatric IBD continues to rise globally, driven by environmental and genetic interactions, especially in rapidly industrializing regions. Novel diagnostic tools, age-specific treatment protocols, biologics, nutritional strategies, and psychosocial support are reshaping care. Emphasis on very early-onset IBD, transition care, and regional policy adaptations underscores the evolving complexity of managing pediatric IBD. The landscape of pediatric IBD care is rapidly evolving. Addressing the distinct pathophysiology, developmental impact, and healthcare challenges of pediatric patients requires an integrated, child-centered approach. Ongoing research into genetics, immune pathways, and the microbiome will be essential in tailoring precision therapies and improving outcomes globally.

While historically considered a condition of adulthood, IBD has gained increasing recognition in pediatric populations[ 1 2 Historically, the understanding and management of IBD have been mainly based on adult populations. However, the appearance of IBD in children presents unique clinical and developmental challenges that differ significantly from adult-onset disease. Pediatric patients often show more widespread inflammation, faster disease progression, and complications such as growth delays, delayed puberty, and nutritional deficiencies[ 3 4 5 This review aims to provide a comprehensive and current analysis of pediatric IBD, framed around two core dimensions: Navigating the persistent challenges of diagnosis, treatment, and disease monitoring, and exploring the emerging frontiers in genetics, microbiome science, personalized medicine, and psychosocial care. By comparing global and regional epidemiologic patterns, including the rising burden in the Arabian Gulf this article highlights both the enduring obstacles and the evolving opportunities to improve outcomes for children living with IBD. GLOBAL AND REGIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PEDIATRIC IBD Rising global incidence: Developed vs developing regions Over the past few decades, the incidence and prevalence of pediatric IBD have demonstrated a striking global increase, transforming IBD into a growing public health concern in both developed and developing nations[ 6 per 2 On the other hand, the most significant epidemiological changes have occurred in developing and newly industrialized regions, including parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. These regions, once considered low-incidence areas, are now seeing a rapid increase in pediatric IBD cases[ 6 7 The disparity in disease emergence between developed and developing regions suggests a strong role for environmental modifiers, including hygiene, antibiotic use, dietary patterns, and lifestyle changes, in genetically susceptible individuals. Moreover, this rise in pediatric cases is often associated with more severe disease phenotypes and younger ages of onset, including VEO-IBD, placing additional strain on healthcare systems that may lack pediatric IBD-specific resources[ 8 9 Pediatric IBD prevalence around the globe Over the past two decades, extensive research has unequivocally demonstrated a substantial global rise in pediatric IBD. This increase is particularly pronounced in high-income regions such as North America and Europe, which continue to report some of the highest incidence and prevalence rates worldwide. In North America, Canada stands out with persistently high rates of pediatric IBD. For instance, the incidence of pediatric IBD in Canada often exceeds 15 per per per 10 11 12 In Europe, a comprehensive meta-analysis by Roberts et al 13 per per per 13 Asia, traditionally considered a low-incidence region, is currently experiencing the most rapid relative increase in pediatric IBD, often mirroring the trends observed in Western countries decades ago. In Japan, recent studies indicate a pediatric IBD incidence ranging from 3.0 to 4.5 per per 14 per 15 16 17 In South America, the incidence and prevalence of IBD have been steadily increasing, although generally remaining lower than in North America and Europe. For instance, in Brazil, the incidence of CD has shown a significant rise, from 0.08 per per 18 per 19 18 Oceania, particularly Australia and New Zealand, reports some of the highest pediatric IBD rates globally, comparable to or even exceeding those in North America and Northern Europe. A meta-analysis of 19 studies has confirmed a dramatic rise in pediatric-onset IBD over the past two decades, with a steep increase in the incidence of CD[ 20 per 21 In Africa, high-quality, population-based epidemiological data for pediatric IBD remain scarce. However, indirect evidence, such as increasing search interest for IBD-related terms on platforms like Google trends, suggests a growing awareness and potentially an emerging rise in IBD cases across the continent[ 22 23 These regional differences underscore the complex interplay of various factors, including variations in genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, and disparities in healthcare infrastructure, surveillance capabilities, and diagnostic practices. Nonetheless, the convergence of rising trends globally, particularly the acceleration in newly industrialized regions, strongly suggests a broader influence of changing environmental risk factors[ 24 Emerging trends in the Arabian Gulf and Middle East and North Africa region The Arabian Gulf and broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region have witnessed a remarkable surge in the incidence and recognition of pediatric IBD over the past two decades, posing a growing challenge to regional healthcare systems. Once considered rare, IBD particularly CD is now increasingly diagnosed among children and adolescents, a trend reflecting both a genuine rise in disease incidence and significant improvements in clinical awareness, diagnostic capabilities, and healthcare access[ 25 Recent epidemiological reports from Gulf countries consistently demonstrate this growing trend, with several centers reporting an annual increase in new pediatric IBD diagnoses. This notable uptick directly parallels rapid socioeconomic development, widespread urbanization, and a discernible shift toward Westernized dietary habits and lifestyles environmental factors robustly linked to increased IBD risk globally[ 26 27 Distinctive features have also been observed in the regional pediatric IBD phenotype. Studies from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, for instance, consistently report a predominance of CD over UC, with many children presenting with moderate to severe disease activity, extensive ileocolonic involvement, and notable growth failure at diagnosis[ 28 29 Despite these advancements in recognition and diagnosis, the region continues to face significant challenges. These include ongoing delays in diagnosis, often caused by overlapping symptoms with more common infectious or nutritional disorders, a notable lack of dedicated multidisciplinary pediatric IBD centers, and frequently limited or unequal access to biologics and advanced therapies in some areas[ 30 25 Pediatric IBD prevalence in the MENA region: A summary While the lack of comprehensive national registries limits the ability to provide precise, generalizable population-based prevalence figures for every country in the MENA region, available studies from tertiary centers and systematic reviews offer valuable insights into the burden of pediatric IBD. These prevalence figures, typically expressed per 31 In Bahrain, the overall pediatric IBD prevalence is notably high at 25.64 per per per 32 33 per per per 34 per per per 35 per per per 28 per per 26 While specific pediatric prevalence rates for CD and UC in Jordan are not available, the overall incidence of IBD across all age groups in the country was notably high at 6.9 per 25 36 per per per 37 per per per 38 per 25 36 per per 1 per 1 Figure 1  Comparative pediatric inflammatory bowel disease incidence across global and Arabian Gulf regions ( per per per Table 1 Global vs  Feature  Global  Arabian Gulf region Overall trend Rising incidence worldwide, particularly in newly industrialized and urbanizing regions Significant and consistent increase in incidence and recognition, especially over the past two decades Incidence change (1990-2019) Increase 22.8% globally in children/adolescents (Global Burden of Disease data) Increasing across Gulf countries ( e.g. Proportion diagnosed before age 20 Approximately 25%-30% of total IBD cases Similar or higher in some regional cohorts, with peak onset between ages 10-16 VEO-IBD (age < 6) Rising; accounts for approximately 15% of pediatric IBD in some registries; often severe or monogenic Presumed to be rising; more common in consanguineous populations; monogenic IBD increasingly reported High-incidence regions Canada, Northern Europe (Sweden, United Kingdom), Oceania (NZ, Australia): ≥ 10-20/100000/year Transitioning from low to moderate incidence; still lower than North America/Europe but rapidly increasing Recent pediatric incidence ( per Canada: 15-20 +; Sweden: 10-12; Japan: 3-4.5; South Korea: 2.5-4.0; Brazil: Approximately 5.5 Bahrain: CD 1.0, UC 2.5; Saudi Arabia: Regional estimates 3-4; Jordan (all ages): 6.9 Prevalence ( per Canada: CD 50-60, UC 30; United States (2016): Approximately 77 total; Europe: CD 8.2-60, UC 8.3-30 Bahrain: CD 9.3, UC 16.3; Saudi Arabia: CD 4.1, UC 2.76; Kuwait: CD 1.53, UC 0.6; Egypt: CD 2.0, UC 1.5 Highest incidence Canada: Up to 23 per Jordan: 6.9 per per Genetic role About 20% have a family history; monogenic IBD is common in VEO-IBD Consanguinity increases familial clustering and monogenic IBD risk in early-onset cases Environmental risk factors Westernization, hygiene hypothesis, antibiotic exposure, sedentary lifestyle Similar environmental changes linked to rising IBD (urbanization, western diets, reduced microbial exposure) Common pediatric phenotype CD more common than UC; aggressive disease in younger children (CD) CD predominates; ileocolonic involvement, more extensive disease, frequent growth failure, severe onset in many cohorts IBD-U Approximately 10%-15% at initial diagnosis; requires further subclassification Common at presentation due to overlapping features and limited access to advanced diagnostics Data gaps Better registry coverage in North America/Europe; underreported in parts of Asia, South America Hospital-based data dominate; lack of national registries in many MENA states CD: Crohn’s disease; UC: Ulcerative colitis; VEO-IBD: Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease; IBD-U: Inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified; IBD: Inflammatory bowel disease; MENA: Middle East and North Africa. Role of westernization, urbanization, and consanguinity The rising incidence of pediatric IBD in regions such as the Arabian Gulf and MENA is increasingly attributed to the interplay of environmental and sociocultural factors, particularly westernization, urbanization, and consanguinity[ 39 Westernization has dramatically reshaped dietary patterns, lifestyle habits, and exposure to environmental agents in many traditionally low-incidence countries. The transition from fiber-rich, traditional diets to processed, high-fat, and low-residue foods has been associated with alterations in gut microbiota, mucosal immunity, and intestinal barrier function factors implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD[ 40 41 2 Figure 2  Conceptual diagram of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis. Urbanization compounds these risks by introducing more sedentary behaviors, increasing psychosocial stress, reducing breastfeeding rates, and limiting exposure to natural environments all of which may negatively impact immune development and gut microbial composition. Rapid development in the Arabian Gulf has created urban ecosystems that mirror Western societies, which, in turn, has been paralleled by a marked uptick in autoimmune and allergic diseases, including pediatric IBD[ 6 Consanguinity, a common cultural practice in many Middle Eastern populations, plays a unique role in shaping the pediatric IBD landscape, especially in early-onset cases. High rates of consanguineous marriages increase the chance of autosomal recessive inheritance patterns and monogenic forms of IBD, particularly in children diagnosed before age six VEO-IBD[ 42 43 Taken together, the convergence of Western lifestyle adoption, urban living conditions, and unique genetic backgrounds underscores the complex, multifactorial etiology of pediatric IBD in the Arabian Gulf and similar regions. Understanding these contextual factors is crucial for tailoring prevention strategies, public health policies, and clinical care to meet the evolving needs of affected children[ 44 CHALLENGES IN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTION Accurate and comprehensive epidemiological data on pediatric IBD are crucial for understanding disease burden, identifying risk factors, and informing effective health policies. While significant strides have been made, data collection remains a complex endeavor with distinct challenges across different global settings. Challenges in developing countries, including the MENA region In many developing countries, particularly within the MENA region, accurate and comprehensive epidemiological data on pediatric IBD remain limited. This scarcity poses significant obstacles to understanding the true disease burden, identifying local risk factors, and creating effective health policies tailored to specific populations[ 25 One major challenge is the absence or infancy of national or regional IBD registries, which severely hampers efforts to track incidence, prevalence, and disease trends over time. Unlike developed countries, which often benefit from extensive databases and established surveillance systems that support long-term studies, many developing areas frequently rely on single-center or retrospective research. This limits the generalizability and scope of their findings[ 45 Underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are significant concerns. Limited access to specialized pediatric gastroenterologists, advanced endoscopic services, and modern diagnostic tools, such as fecal calprotectin, comprehensive genetic panels, and specialized histopathological expertise can delay or hinder accurate diagnosis. In some regions, children presenting with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, or anemia may initially be treated for common infectious diseases, malnutrition, or other endemic conditions, leading to substantial delays in recognizing and diagnosing IBD[ 46 Variability and resource limitations in health infrastructure further exacerbate these challenges. Health systems in many developing countries are often overwhelmed and under-resourced, prioritizing acute infectious diseases over chronic, non-communicable illnesses like IBD. Inconsistent referral processes, fragmented care models, and poor integration of electronic medical records collectively diminish the quality and completeness of data collection[ 6 Furthermore, sociopolitical instability and conflict in parts of the developing world, including areas of the MENA region, profoundly disrupt healthcare delivery and research efforts. War, mass displacement, and economic crises restrict access to medical care, drive rapid population movement, and interrupt long-term follow-up, thereby skewing epidemiological assessments and making consistent data collection exceedingly difficult[ 47 48 Comparable challenges in developed countries While developed nations generally boast more robust healthcare infrastructures and established registry systems, they’re not immune to data collection challenges in pediatric IBD[ 49 50 51 52 Addressing the complex challenges in pediatric IBD data collection worldwide requires collaborative efforts that recognize both common and region-specific obstacles. This involves establishing and strengthening pediatric IBD registries, especially promoting new ones in developing regions while improving the comprehensiveness and interoperability of existing registries globally[ 53 CLINICAL PHENOTYPES AND DISEASE CLASSIFICATION IBD in children is generally categorized into three main clinical types: CD, UC, and IBD-U. Each of these subtypes has distinct pathophysiological features, clinical signs, and disease courses, which can be further specified in the pediatric population due to age-related developmental differences. Table 2 54 Table 2 Key differentiating factors between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis  Feature  CD  UC  IBD-U Location Any part of the GI tract (mouth to anus) Limited to the colon and rectum Colon only Inflammation pattern Discontinuous (skip lesions) Continuous Colonic, but with features unclear for CD/UC Depth of involvement Transmural (full thickness) Mucosal and submucosal (superficial) Overlapping or ambiguous features Rectal involvement Often spared (rectal sparing) Always involved (proctitis) Variable, can be involved Microscopic features Non-caseating granulomas (characteristic) Crypt abscesses (common), no granulomas Ambiguous; may have some transmural features but no granulomas Fistulas/strictures Common Rare (unless long-standing, severe disease) Rare, but can develop features over time Perianal disease Common Rare Rare Cobble stoning Characteristic endoscopic appearance (CD) Absent Absent (classic UC) Surgical cure Not curative (disease can recur) Curative for GI manifestations Variable, depends on evolving phenotype CD: Crohn’s disease; UC: Ulcerative colitis; IBD-U: Inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified; GI: Gastrointestinal. CD CD is a transmural, segmental, and often granulomatous inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. In children, the terminal ileum and colon are the most frequently involved sites. CD is characterized by patchy areas of inflammation, often described as “skip lesions”, which may lead to strictures, fistulas, and abscesses over time. Pediatric-onset CD is notable for its more aggressive behavior compared to adult-onset forms, with a higher likelihood of extensive involvement, perianal disease, and extraintestinal manifestations such as growth retardation, pubertal delay, and nutritional deficiencies. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and perianal complications[ 55 UC UC, by contrast, is a continuous, mucosal inflammation confined to the colon, usually starting at the rectum and extending proximally. In pediatric cases, extensive colitis or pancolitis occurs more frequently than in adults, while left-sided or proctitis-only involvement is relatively uncommon. Children with UC often present with bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, urgency, tenesmus, and systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss in more severe cases. Although UC generally does not involve the full thickness of the bowel wall like CD does, severe cases can still cause significant complications, including toxic megacolon and a higher risk of colectomy[ 56 IBD-U IBD-U includes cases where clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and radiologic features do not definitively identify as either CD or UC, even after a thorough diagnostic evaluation. IBD-U is more frequently seen in children, partly because of incomplete disease progression or atypical presentations. This diagnosis may evolve into CD or UC over time as more clinical or histological features become apparent. Accurate and timely classification is vital because it greatly influences treatment choices and long-term management[ 57 58 Differences in disease behavior between children and adults Pediatric-onset IBD often exhibits different clinical behavior, disease distribution, and progression compared to adult-onset disease, requiring a specialized approach to care (Table 3 59 Table 3 Comparison of paediatric vs  Feature  Pediatric-onset IBD  Adult-onset IBD Disease extent More extensive disease ( e.g. More localized ( e.g. Severity at onset Often more severe with rapid progression Variable; may have a milder course at onset Growth and development Commonly affected (growth failure, delayed puberty, bone density loss) Growth is not an issue Perianal disease More common in pediatric Crohn’s disease Less frequent Extraintestinal manifestations More frequent and severe Present, but generally less common Disease behavior over time More aggressive with higher risk of complications (stricturing, penetrating) Slower progression in many cases Response to therapy Often good response, but long-term therapy and toxicity concerns Shorter treatment duration; toxicity concerns more manageable Psychosocial impact High impact on quality of life, schooling, and emotional development Significant, but generally with better coping mechanisms Treatment adherence More challenging, especially during adolescence Usually, better self-management and adherence CD: Crohn’s disease; UC: Ulcerative colitis; IBD: Inflammatory bowel disease. Children frequently present with more extensive and severe disease at diagnosis. For instance, pediatric CD commonly involves the entire gastrointestinal tract (panenteric disease, affecting both the small and large intestines). It has a higher incidence of perianal manifestations, while pediatric UC is more often characterized by pancolitis[ 60 61 A critical distinguishing feature of pediatric IBD is its significant impact on growth and pubertal development, a complication rarely observed in adults. Chronic inflammation, malabsorption, and the use of corticosteroids can lead to linear growth failure, delayed puberty, and decreased bone mineral density[ 3 62 Furthermore, children with IBD are more susceptible to extraintestinal manifestations and tend to exhibit a more aggressive disease course over time, increasing the risk of developing structuring and penetrating complications, particularly in CD. The frequent occurrence of extraintestinal manifestations, such as arthritis, uveitis, erythema nodosum, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, necessitates a multidisciplinary care approach involving specialists beyond gastroenterology[ 63 64 Finally, IBD in children and adolescents occurs during crucial periods of physical, psychological, and social development. The burden of chronic illness, including frequent medical visits, invasive procedures, and social stigma, can significantly impact mental health, academic performance, and overall quality of life[ 65 66 Use of the Paris classification for pediatric IBD The Paris classification, introduced in 2011 as a pediatric adaptation of the Montreal system, is widely used to categorize IBD in children and adolescents. Recognizing the distinct clinical features and disease courses in pediatric patients compared to adults, this classification provides age-appropriate criteria for defining disease phenotype, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis, management, and prognosis[ 67 68 For CD, the Paris classification refines the anatomical location into ileal, colonic, and ileocolonic, and further subdivides upper gastrointestinal involvement into proximal (above the ligament of Treitz) and distal segments, which can coexist with other locations. It also categorizes disease behavior as non-stricturing/non-penetrating, stricturing, penetrating, or a combination, and includes a perianal disease modifier to capture this crucial clinical feature[ 67 67 62 The Paris classification is valuable in clinical practice because it standardizes the description of pediatric IBD phenotypes, guides treatment decisions by identifying more aggressive disease patterns, and aids in prognostication. It also facilitates research by providing a common framework to compare pediatric IBD cohorts[ 69 67 DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES IN PEDIATRIC IBD Atypical presentations in children (e.g., growth failure, delayed puberty) Diagnosing IBD in children can be especially difficult due to atypical or subtle symptoms that differ significantly from adult-onset disease. Although classic symptoms like chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding are seen in children, many pediatric patients particularly younger ones initially show extraintestinal or nonspecific signs that can delay diagnosis[ 70 Growth failure is a key atypical feature in pediatric IBD and may appear months or even years before gastrointestinal symptoms. Chronic intestinal inflammation, combined with reduced caloric intake and increased metabolic demands, interferes with standard growth patterns. A decline in height velocity or failure to reach expected growth milestones should lead clinicians to consider IBD, especially after ruling out other common causes[ 71 3 Additional atypical presentations include fatigue, iron deficiency anemia, arthralgia, and oral manifestations such as aphthous ulcers. In some children, these may be the only signs initially, leading to misdiagnosis or referral to multiple specialists before the underlying IBD is identified. The diagnostic challenge is even greater in very young children, especially those under 6 years old classified as VEO-IBD, as their symptoms can resemble infections, immunodeficiencies, or allergic colitis[ 4 72 Role of endoscopy, imaging, biomarkers, and histopathology Accurate diagnosis of pediatric IBD requires a comprehensive, multi-modal approach that combines clinical evaluation with advanced diagnostic techniques. Due to the variability of presentation in children and overlap with other gastrointestinal and systemic disorders, no single test is definitive; instead, diagnosis depends on a combination of endoscopic, radiologic, laboratory, and histopathologic assessments[ 73 Endoscopy remains the essential tool for diagnosing IBD. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy, with multiple biopsies from both inflamed and non-inflamed areas, enable direct visualization and histologic confirmation of mucosal inflammation. This is especially important for distinguishing between CD and UC, as well as identifying features of IBD-U[ 74 75 Imaging complements endoscopy by providing non-invasive evaluation of the small bowel and extraintestinal complications. Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is preferred due to its superior soft tissue contrast and lack of ionizing radiation, making it ideal for children who require repeated assessments. MRE is beneficial in detecting transmural inflammation, fistulas, strictures, and abscesses features more commonly associated with CD[ 76 77 Biomarkers serve as valuable adjuncts in both the diagnostic and monitoring phases. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are traditional inflammatory markers, but they may lack sensitivity or specificity in the early stages of disease. Fecal calprotectin has emerged as a reliable, non-invasive marker of intestinal inflammation, with high sensitivity for detecting mucosal disease activity. While not diagnostic on their own, elevated biomarkers can guide the need for further invasive testing and help monitor response to therapy[ 78 Histopathology provides definitive confirmation of chronic intestinal inflammation and is critical for distinguishing IBD from mimics such as infectious colitis, allergic colitis, or primary immunodeficiencies. Characteristic features, such as crypt architectural distortion, granulomas (indicative of CD), basal plasmacytosis, and goblet cell depletion, are key diagnostic clues. In very young children, histopathologic findings may be less specific, necessitating expert review by pediatric pathologists[ 79 80 Need for genetic testing and immunological evaluation in VEO-IBD VEO-IBD, defined as IBD diagnosed before the age of 6 years, presents unique diagnostic and management challenges that differentiate it from later-onset pediatric IBD. A significant number of these cases are now recognized as monogenic in origin, caused by single-gene defects that impair immune regulation, epithelial barrier function, or microbial interactions in the gut. As a result, genetic testing and immunological evaluation have become crucial parts of the diagnostic process in this subgroup[ 4 81 IL10 IL10RA XIAP FOXP3 TTC7A CYBB 82 Next-generation sequencing techniques, such as whole-exome sequencing or targeted gene panels, have significantly enhanced the ability to detect these mutations. Early genetic diagnosis has significant implications not only for prognosis and genetic counseling but also for treatment decisions[ 83 84 e.g. 85 86 Limitations in current pediatric diagnostic pathways Despite significant advancements in the understanding and diagnosis of pediatric IBD, several limitations persist in current diagnostic pathways that can delay timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in younger children. These limitations arise from both clinical complexities and systemic constraints[ 87 88 Moreover, diagnostic tools validated in adults may not be fully applicable to children. For instance, disease activity indices like the CD activity index or Mayo score are limited in pediatric contexts. Although pediatric-specific tools, such as the pediatric CD activity index (PCDAI) and the pediatric UC activity index (PUCAI), exist, their use is not uniformly adopted across all clinical settings[ 89 e.g. 90 Another gap is the lack of standardized diagnostic algorithms that integrate clinical, endoscopic, histologic, imaging, serologic, and genetic findings in a pediatric context. This leads to variation in diagnostic approaches between institutions and may contribute to inconsistencies in diagnosis, classification, and subsequent treatment[ 91 Finally, insufficient awareness among general paediatricians and primary care providers regarding the early warning signs of pediatric IBD adds to diagnostic delays. Educational initiatives targeting frontline providers are needed to improve early recognition and prompt referral[ 92 IMPACT ON GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH Pediatric IBD extends its burden beyond the gastrointestinal tract, exerting profound effects on a child’s physical growth, pubertal development, and psychological well-being. These impacts are often more severe than in adult-onset IBD due to the disease’s interference with key developmental milestones[ 93 Growth impairment Growth failure is a hallmark feature of pediatric IBD, particularly in CD. Chronic intestinal inflammation leads to malabsorption, increased metabolic demands, anorexia, and cytokine-mediated growth suppression, all of which contribute to impaired linear growth[ 71 62 Delayed puberty and bone health Children with IBD frequently experience delayed puberty, which can result from both chronic inflammation and nutritional deficiencies, including low levels of zinc, vitamin D, and other essential micronutrients. Hormonal imbalances, especially in those with prolonged or poorly controlled disease, may contribute to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism[ 3 94 Nutritional deficiencies Malnutrition is a common and complex issue in pediatric IBD, often resulting from decreased oral intake, increased nutrient loss, and increased energy requirements. Children may present with deficiencies in iron, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D, calcium, and zinc. These deficiencies not only contribute to anemia and growth failure but also impair immune function and wound healing, further complicating disease management[ 95 Psychosocial and emotional impact The chronic, unpredictable nature of IBD can significantly affect a child’s emotional and psychological development. Children with IBD report higher rates of anxiety, depression, social isolation, and body image concerns. Frequent hospital visits, school absences, dietary restrictions, and stigma associated with symptoms such as diarrhea or fecal incontinence can hinder academic success and social interactions[ 65 96 Quality of life Overall health-related quality of life is often diminished in children with IBD. Even during periods of remission, fears of relapse, medication side effects, and long-term disease implications can create psychological strain. Instruments such as the impact questionnaire (explicitly developed for pediatric IBD patients) have shown that quality of life is closely tied to disease activity, nutritional status, and social support[ 66 MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES: OLD CHALLENGES Overview of current treatment options (aminosalicylates, steroids, immunomodulators, biologics) The management of pediatric IBD requires a personalized, step-up or top-down approach aimed at inducing remission, sustaining mucosal healing, preventing complications, and promoting normal growth and psychosocial development. The treatment modalities include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologic therapies, and small-molecule agents, each with distinct mechanisms, indications, and limitations[ 97  Aminosalicylates: 98 99  Corticosteroids: 100 101 Budesonide is a glucocorticoid steroid that acts locally in the intestinal mucosa, offering a low risk of systemic side effects (approximately 10% systemic absorption) due to its high first-pass metabolism. It’s effective for inducing remission in mild to moderate CD in the ileum and/or ascending colon, typically starting at 9 mg/day and tapering down. While a Cochrane review found it superior to placebo and mesalamine for remission induction in CD after 8 weeks (with 42%-55% efficacy in pediatric trials), a 6 mg/day dose is ineffective for relapse prevention, only for short-term maintenance. Importantly, budesonide hasn’t shown superiority over prednisone, which may even be more effective in cases where budesonide fails. Therefore, budesonide is best reserved for specific CD cases where its localized action is beneficial[ 102  Immunomodulators: 103 e.g. 104  Biologics: 30 105 106 e.g. e.g. 107 Despite their effectiveness, biologics are associated with several limitations. These include the risk of infusion or injection-site reactions, severe infections such as tuberculosis or opportunistic pathogens, immunogenicity leading to the formation of anti-drug antibodies, and the psychological burden of regular injections or infusions[ 108 109 e.g. e.g. 110  Small-molecule agents (JAK inhibitors): 111 112 113 97  Nutritional therapy and growth monitoring: 114 EEN is a well-established, first-line therapy for inducing remission in pediatric CD, particularly in Europe. It involves the exclusive use of a nutritionally complete liquid formula for 6-8 weeks, with the exclusion of normal food[ 115 116 117 Children with IBD are at risk of various micronutrient deficiencies, including iron, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folate, and zinc, due to poor intake, malabsorption, or chronic inflammation. Routine monitoring and timely supplementation are essential, particularly as deficiencies can contribute to fatigue, poor bone health, and anemia, exacerbating the disease burden[ 118 3 62 Pediatric IBD-related complications Pediatric IBD can lead to a variety of complications that significantly affect a child’s long-term health, growth, and quality of life, often following a more aggressive course than adult-onset disease[ 119 e.g. e.g. 120 46 62 121 Challenges with long-term steroid use, adherence, and side effects Corticosteroids have long been a cornerstone in the induction of remission for moderate-to-severe pediatric IBD, particularly in both CD and UC. However, their use is fraught with well-recognized challenges that are especially concerning in the pediatric population[ 46 122 The adverse effects of long-term steroid therapy are particularly pronounced in children. These include impaired linear growth, delayed puberty, reduced bone mineral density, hypertension, hyperglycemia, cushingoid appearance, mood disturbances, and increased infection risk. Even short-term use can significantly suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with implications for stress response and recovery[ 123 124 Given these risks, clinical guidelines now emphasize minimizing steroid exposure. The use of EEN for induction in CD, early initiation of immunomodulators ( e.g. e.g. 125 126 Surgical considerations in children Surgical intervention remains a vital component in the multidisciplinary management of pediatric IBD, particularly for patients with medically refractory disease, growth failure, or complications such as strictures, fistulas, and toxic megacolon. While surgery does not cure IBD, especially CD, it can significantly improve quality of life and disease control when medical therapies fall short[ 127 In pediatric CD, surgery is typically indicated for stricturing or penetrating complications ( e.g. 128 129 130 131 The timing of surgery is essential and often involves shared decision-making among pediatric gastroenterologists, surgeons, and families. Delaying surgery in hopes of achieving further pharmacologic response can worsen nutritional status and post-surgical outcomes[ 132 133 134 66 Need for age-specific treatment protocols The management of pediatric IBD requires age-specific treatment protocols that address the unique physiological, developmental, and psychosocial needs of children. Disease presentation often varies by age, with younger patients especially those with VEO-IBD more likely to display atypical or monogenic forms of the disease, necessitating distinct diagnostic and therapeutic strategies[ 66 120 Nutritional status and growth are also critical concerns in pediatric IBD. Treatment plans must support linear growth and pubertal development, with therapies like EEN often playing a primary role in inducing remission, particularly in CD[ 135 136 137 3 Figure 3  Proposed very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease diagnostic and management pathway. EMERGING FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRIC IBD CARE Personalized medicine and biologic advances The evolution of pediatric IBD care is increasingly shaped by the principles of personalized medicine, which aims to tailor treatment strategies based on individual patient characteristics, including genetic, molecular, microbial, and clinical profiles. This approach is particularly relevant in children, where heterogeneity in disease behavior, therapeutic response, and long-term outcomes is more pronounced than in adults[ 138 139 140 Advances in pharmacogenomics and therapeutic drug monitoring are further refining the biologic use. By identifying genetic markers and pharmacokinetic parameters that predict treatment response or adverse events, clinicians can optimize drug selection and dosing on an individual basis. For example, understanding variations in the TNF receptor pathway or drug clearance rates can guide the decision between different biologic agents or the timing of dose escalation[ 141 142 143 Novel therapies (e.g., JAK inhibitors, stem cell transplantation in monogenic IBD) In recent years, the field of pediatric IBD treatment has grown to include innovative strategies beyond traditional immunosuppressants and biologics. Notable advancements include small molecule therapies, such as JAK inhibitors, and cellular therapies like hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially for monogenic IBD cases[ 144 145 146 In parallel, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has emerged as a curative option in children with monogenic IBD, particularly those with mutations in genes involved in immune regulation ( e.g. IL10 FOXP3 XIAP 147 148 149 The microbiome: Role in pathogenesis and potential for therapeutic manipulation The gut microbiome has become a key factor in the development of IBD, especially in children, where early microbial exposures influence immune development[ 150 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Enterobacteriaceae 151 152 153 154 Microbiome-targeted therapies include the use of prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics, all aimed at restoring a balanced microbial ecosystem. Although widely available, their effectiveness in IBD remains inconsistent, especially in moderate to severe cases. However, ongoing research aims to identify specific strains or microbial signatures that could provide targeted therapeutic benefits[ 155 Clostridioides difficile 156 157 Role of precision nutrition and diet-based interventions Nutritional therapy has long been a key part of pediatric IBD management, especially in CD. As knowledge of the gut-immune-microbiome axis has expanded, so has the concept of precision nutrition. This emerging field focuses on tailoring dietary plans to individual patient profiles, disease type, microbial composition, and inflammation levels[ 158 115 e.g. 159 Precision nutrition goes beyond generalized diet plans by incorporating insights from nutrigenomics, microbiome sequencing, and metabolomics to identify individualized dietary triggers or deficiencies. For example, identifying children with microbiota profiles predictive of diet responsiveness may allow clinicians to choose between enteral nutrition, food-based exclusion diets, or probiotic supplementation with greater accuracy and efficacy[ 114 Moreover, diet-based interventions are increasingly recognized not only for their role in reducing disease activity but also in addressing extraintestinal complications such as growth failure, bone demineralization, and micronutrient deficiencies. Regular assessment of caloric intake, macronutrient balance, and levels of critical micronutrients, such as iron, vitamin D, and zinc, is essential, particularly in children with restricted diets[ 160 Innovations in disease monitoring (e.g., non-invasive biomarkers, wearable tech, telemedicine, digital health, and patient engagement tools) Monitoring pediatric IBD traditionally relies on clinical indices, endoscopy, imaging, and laboratory markers such as C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin. However, repeated invasive procedures and blood draws pose practical and psychological challenges for children. In recent years, non-invasive biomarkers and digital health innovations have emerged as transformative tools in improving disease surveillance while minimizing patient burden[ 161 162 163 164 Wearable technologies represent a new frontier in pediatric IBD monitoring. Devices that track vital signs, physical activity, sleep patterns, and gastrointestinal symptoms offer continuous, real-world data that can enhance early detection of flares or complications. For instance, wearable biosensors capable of tracking heart rate variability or gut motility may serve as early indicators of disease exacerbation, potentially allowing for proactive intervention before clinical deterioration occurs[ 165 Parallel to these technological advances is the rise of telemedicine and digital health platforms, especially catalyzed by the corona virus disease 2019 pandemic. Virtual consultations have improved access to specialized care, especially for patients in remote or underserved areas[ 166 167 Importantly, PROs are becoming integral to care models, reflecting a shift towards more patient-centered approaches. PROs directly capture the child’s and family’s perspective on symptoms, functional status, quality of life, and treatment side effects, providing invaluable real-world data that complements objective clinical and laboratory findings[ 168 169 Despite these promising developments, challenges remain. Data integration into electronic health records, standardization of wearable metrics, ensuring digital equity across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, and addressing privacy concerns must be tackled to ensure equitable and secure implementation of these tools[ 170 PSYCHOSOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT Impact of chronic illness on mental health, schooling, and family dynamics Pediatric IBD is more than just a physical health issue, it’s a chronic, relapsing illness that significantly impacts a child’s emotional well-being, cognitive development, academic success, and family life. The unpredictable nature of flares, the necessity for invasive treatments, and the long-term consequences of living with a life-changing disease can create a substantial psychosocial burden[ 65 171 172 Academic performance and school attendance are also commonly disrupted. Recurrent symptoms like abdominal pain, urgency, and fatigue, along with frequent medical appointments or hospital stays, can lead to absenteeism and academic underachievement[ 173 174 Family dynamics are deeply affected by pediatric IBD. Parents often experience significant emotional strain, including guilt, fear, and burnout from the demands of managing a chronic disease. Siblings may feel neglected or confused, especially when attention and resources are disproportionately focused on the affected child[ 175 176 Importantly, resilience and adaptability can also emerge in families dealing with chronic illness. With appropriate psychosocial support, including counseling, peer support groups, and integrated care models involving psychologists or social workers children and families can develop strong coping mechanisms and maintain a good quality of life[ 177 4 Figure 4  Multidisciplinary pediatric inflammatory bowel disease care model. Transition challenges from pediatric to adult care: Emotional and practical considerations Transitioning from pediatric to adult care is a pivotal milestone in the management of IBD, and for many adolescents, it represents both a developmental and healthcare challenge. While the goal is a seamless handover that ensures continuity of care, the transition period is often fraught with emotional, psychological, and logistical complexities that can jeopardize disease control and overall well-being[ 178 179 180 Practically, many healthcare systems still lack standardized, well-defined protocols for transition, often resulting in poorly coordinated or abrupt transfers to adult services. Crucial medical history may not be communicated effectively, and patients may face gaps in care, inconsistent treatment strategies, or even reluctance from adult providers to manage complex pediatric-onset IBD cases, especially those with complications like growth failure, prior surgeries, or significant psychosocial comorbidities[ 181 182 183 e.g. 184 185 Despite the recognized benefits and outlined best practices, a key remaining challenge lies in the widespread and consistent implementation of these structured transition programs. Barriers include a lack of dedicated funding, insufficiently trained personnel ( e.g. 186 187 Importance of psychological and social support Managing pediatric IBD goes far beyond medical treatment, encompassing essential psychological and social support. Since IBD is chronic and relapsing, and its onset happens during critical developmental years, children and teenagers need a comprehensive care approach that addresses their mental, emotional, and social needs alongside their physical health[ 188 189 190 Social support is equally vital. Peer relationships are crucial for social development, but children with IBD may struggle to participate in typical social, school, or extracurricular activities due to fatigue, dietary restrictions, or fear of accidents and embarrassment. These issues can lead to withdrawal, low self-esteem, and feelings of isolation. Support groups either in person or online can provide a strong sense of community, reduce stigma, and help kids realize they are not alone[ 191 192 Family support is also essential. Parents and caregivers frequently encounter emotional stress, financial difficulties, and caregiver fatigue. Siblings may feel overlooked or confused. Offering family counseling, educational resources, and respite services can enhance family connections and reduce caregiver stress. Equipping parents with tools to communicate effectively with their child and manage care-related concerns helps sustain a supportive and steady home[ 177 Schools are a vital area where support can make a meaningful difference. Teachers and school staff should understand the child’s condition and recommend necessary accommodations, such as bathroom access, flexible schedules, or modified physical activities[ 193 194 FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES Expanding genetic and immunologic understanding of pediatric IBD Advances in molecular medicine are quickly changing our understanding of pediatric IBD, especially with growing insights into genetic and immunologic foundations. Unlike adult-onset IBD, pediatric forms particularly VEO-IBD are increasingly seen as a diverse group of diseases with different underlying mechanisms, many of which are based on single-gene defects or complex immune system dysregulation[ 195 Monogenic IBD is among the most significant recent discoveries. This form, primarily seen in children under six, involves rare mutations in genes that regulate immune pathways, epithelial barrier integrity, and microbial sensing, such as IL10 IL10RA/B FOXP3 NEMO CYBB 196 IL10 197 198 Beyond monogenic forms, polygenic risk profiling and genome-wide association studies have identified many susceptibility loci shared between pediatric and adult IBD. However, emerging evidence indicates that some genetic variants may have stronger effects or show unique penetrance in pediatric patients, highlighting the importance of age-specific genomic studies[ 199 200 On the immunological front, pediatric IBD has been associated with distinct immune signatures, including exaggerated Th17 responses, impaired regulatory T cell function, and altered cytokine profiles. Additionally, early-life immune development, shaped by exposure to microbiota, nutrition, and infections, may influence susceptibility or resistance to IBD[ 201 202 Utilizing multi-omics methods, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics, can enhance disease subtyping and guide the field toward precision medicine. For example, immune profiling may help classify patients based on their likely response to specific biologics or better predict disease progression than relying solely on clinical features. The current limitation lies in validating these multi-omics findings in large, diverse pediatric cohorts and developing cost-effective, scalable platforms for their routine clinical application[ 203 Development of pediatric-specific clinical trials The development of pediatric-specific clinical trials is a vital yet often overlooked area in improving care for children with IBD. Historically, treatment protocols for pediatric IBD have mainly been adapted from adult data, despite apparent differences in disease characteristics, immune responses, pharmacokinetics, and psychosocial factors between the two groups. This reliance on extrapolation creates significant limitations, which can result in less effective treatment or unexpected side effects in younger patients[ 204 Children, especially those with early-onset and VEO-IBD, often face more extensive and aggressive disease types. As a result, there is an urgent need for clinical trials specifically designed to assess therapeutic options, dosing methods, and treatment lengths suitable for children. These trials must also consider growth, puberty, neurodevelopment, and long-term safety factors that adult studies do not adequately address[ 205 206 Recent efforts by international consortia, including the pediatric IBD consortium and the International Organization for the Study of IBD, have started to address these gaps by promoting age-appropriate endpoints, standardized disease activity indices for children (such as PUCAI and PCDAI), and the inclusion of PROs relevant to pediatric populations[ 207 208 However, significant regulatory, ethical, and logistical barriers continue to hinder pediatric trial enrollment. These include the complexities of informed consent/assent, limited patient populations for rare disease subtypes, and concerns about long-term follow-up for a lifelong condition[ 209 210 30 Standardization of VEO-IBD management pathways VEO-IBD is defined as IBD diagnosed before the age of 6, representing a distinct and heterogeneous clinical entity with a unique pathophysiology often rooted in monogenic defects, primary immunodeficiencies, or epithelial barrier dysfunctions[ 4 211 68 Therapeutically, a unified framework is needed to guide escalation strategies based on clinical phenotype, genetic findings, and response to initial treatment. For instance, the traditional step-up approach may be inadequate for certain monogenic IBDs, where early introduction of biologics or immunomodulators or even curative therapies may be warranted[ 212 213 Equally important is the standardization of monitoring protocols. VEO-IBD patients often require more frequent assessments of growth, development, nutritional status, and immune function. Centralized registries and collaborative databases, such as those developed by the Global IBD Genetics Consortium and ESPGHAN’s pediatric IBD working group can facilitate the collection of longitudinal data to refine prognostic indicators and treatment algorithms. Ultimately, the development of internationally recognized, evidence-based guidelines tailored to VEO-IBD will ensure early and accurate diagnosis, streamline personalized treatment strategies, and reduce disease burden[ 214 215 Toward a holistic and multidisciplinary model Effective management of pediatric IBD necessitates a shift from a purely disease-centered paradigm to a holistic and multidisciplinary model of care. This approach integrates medical, psychological, nutritional, and social support services to address the full spectrum of challenges faced by children and adolescents with IBD, aiming not only for disease control but also for optimal growth, development, and quality of life[ 216 188 Integration of psychosocial care is vital. As emotional well-being strongly influences disease perception and adherence, routine psychological screening and early mental health interventions should be embedded in IBD clinics. Similarly, dietitians should routinely assess nutritional status and develop personalized meal plans that support growth and alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, while also considering cultural preferences and socioeconomic realities[ 65 217 218 219 Despite the clear benefits, the widespread implementation of a truly holistic and multidisciplinary model faces significant barriers. These include a severe shortage of specialized pediatric IBD health professionals in many regions, inadequate funding for comprehensive support services ( e.g. 220 Policy and healthcare planning implications in rising-incidence regions As the global occurrence of pediatric IBD continues to increase especially in regions previously considered low-burden, such as the MENA, and parts of Asia there is an urgent need to adapt healthcare systems and policies to meet the changing demands of this growing patient population. The rise in disease burden requires a shift from reactive, fragmented care to proactive, integrated, and sustainable healthcare planning[ 221 222 223 Infrastructure investment is another essential element. Many healthcare systems in regions with increasing incidence rates lack specialized pediatric gastroenterology services, endoscopic capabilities for children, or multidisciplinary care teams[ 224 225 226 227 Public awareness campaigns and physician education programs should also be essential parts of policy efforts. Delayed diagnosis remains common in emerging regions, often due to primary care providers having low awareness or because symptoms are misdiagnosed as infections or malnutrition[ 228 229 119 RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK To effectively address the increasing burden and growing complexity of pediatric IBD, a set of strategic priorities must be collaboratively pursued by clinicians, researchers, and healthcare policymakers, all of which are crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and enhancing the quality of life for children worldwide. This necessitates the development and rigorous implementation of standardized, pediatric-specific guidelines to ensure consistent and evidence-based approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management across different age groups and regions. Integral to this is establishing and expanding multidisciplinary care teams encompassing pediatric gastroenterologists, IBD-specialized nurses, dietitians, psychologists/mental health professionals, and social workers as they are essential for addressing the medical, nutritional, psychosocial, and developmental needs unique to children, thereby improving clinical outcomes and quality of life. Furthermore, implementing formal and structured programs to facilitate the seamless transition of adolescents from pediatric to adult IBD care is vital for empowering young patients with self-management skills, ensuring continuity of care, and mitigating the risk of disease flares. In regions experiencing a rapid increase in IBD, such as the Arabian Gulf and MENA areas, prioritizing and funding national and regional epidemiological registries is fundamental for accurately monitoring disease trends, informing healthcare resource allocation, and supporting local research initiatives. Alongside this, integrating mental health and psychosocial support services into routine IBD care is critical, given the high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and school-related challenges among children with IBD, where proactive screening and early intervention can significantly improve emotional well-being. Looking forward, intensified research efforts into VEO-IBD, focusing on comprehensive genetic and immunologic profiling, are crucial for developing truly personalized and potentially curative treatment strategies. Concurrently, dedicated pediatric clinical trials are imperative to rigorously assess the safety, efficacy, and long-term effects of emerging therapies, as children remain underrepresented in research. The advancement of precision nutrition and dietary modulation as therapeutic strategies also holds promise, requiring further research to understand individual responses to specific diets and their impact on gut microbiota. Finally, health policy reforms are essential in high-growth regions to ensure equitable access to specialized pediatric IBD care, advanced diagnostics, and innovative treatments, overcoming current cost and regulatory barriers. Collectively, these comprehensive efforts aim to transform the landscape of pediatric IBD care, enabling children and adolescents to lead healthier, more fulfilling lives. Limitations While this review provides a comprehensive overview of current knowledge and emerging directions in pediatric IBD, several limitations should be recognized. First, the narrative review design may inherently introduce selection bias because it depends on available literature rather than a systematic search strategy. As a result, some relevant studies might have been unintentionally left out. Additionally, the evolving nature of pediatric IBD research especially in genomics, microbiome science, and personalized medicine means that some findings could quickly become outdated as new evidence emerges. The review also heavily relies on data from high-income countries, which may limit its applicability to resource-limited settings where diagnostic and treatment infrastructure can differ greatly. Moreover, there is limited availability of strong pediatric-specific clinical trial data, particularly in newly industrializing regions, which restricts the depth of evidence-based recommendations for emerging therapies. Lastly, although the review includes regional insights from the Arabian Gulf and MENA regions, variability in epidemiologic data collection across countries may influence the accuracy of regional comparisons and trends. CONCLUSION Pediatric IBD is a rapidly evolving and increasingly recognized global health challenge, characterized by unique clinical features, developmental effects, and management needs compared to adult-onset disease. As incidence rises worldwide including in previously low-incidence regions like the Arabian Gulf there is an urgent need for age-specific, multidisciplinary, and proactive care approaches. Advances in biologics, nutritional strategies, precision medicine, and psychosocial support are transforming pediatric IBD management, but significant challenges remain, especially in accessing specialized care, ensuring diagnostic consistency, and incorporating emerging research into clinical practice. The future of pediatric IBD care depends on collaborative efforts that address regional disparities, increase pediatric-focused research, and turn scientific discoveries into equitable, personalized treatments. Ultimately, a holistic, child-centered approach that includes medical, psychological, nutritional, and social care is essential for improving long-term outcomes and quality of life for affected children and their families.
