Introduction Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the absence of normal esophageal peristalsis [ 1 2 1 3 4 5 The pathophysiology of achalasia involves the progressive loss of ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus, particularly those responsible for inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal peptide. This neuronal degeneration leads to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signals, resulting in sustained contraction of the LES and loss of coordinated peristalsis in the esophageal body. Histopathological studies frequently reveal chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and lymphocytic infiltration around the myenteric plexus, suggesting possible autoimmune or viral etiologies [ 2 6 7 8 9 Achalasia is categorized into various groups based on anatomical features, physiological characteristics, and underlying causes. Achalasia can be classified into two main categories: primary (idiopathic) and secondary forms [ 10 11 10 12 Typical symptoms of achalasia include difficulty swallowing known as dysphagia, retrosternal chest pain, regurgitation which refers to the return of undigested food or esophageal contents into the mouth, unintentional weight loss, and esophageal dilation accompanied by marked narrowing at the GEJ [ 6 7 6 13 14 15 15 16 17 Diagnosis of achalasia is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, imaging, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and HRM, which remains the gold standard [ 18 19 20 21 5 22 22 23 The treatment of achalasia focuses on relieving the functional obstruction at the lower esophageal sphincter and improving esophageal emptying [ 14 24 25 26 27 28 29 Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), first described by Inoue et al. [ 30 31 32 33 1 34 35 As the first endoscopic procedure requiring general anesthesia, POEM poses significant challenges for anesthesia management [ 33 36 37 38 39 2 38 36 33 36 38 40 41 35 38 Given these procedure-related challenges, managing anesthesia in patients with achalasia undergoing POEM requires a careful approach, focusing on perioperative safety and individualized strategies. Recent studies have reported fasting times ranging from 8 to 48 h. The majority recommend a clear liquid diet for at least 24 h or a low-residue diet for 48 h prior to the procedure, particularly for patients at high risk of esophageal retention [ 33 37 39 42 43 33 36 37 38 39 42 44 37 2 36 38 In addition to anesthetic management, outcomes such as symptom relief, recurrence rates, and postoperative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are critical aspects in evaluating the overall success of POEM [ 45 45 46 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Patient Population This retrospective study focused on 51 patients who underwent POEM under general anesthesia due to achalasia between June 2016 and April 2025 at the Department of Gastroenterology, Inonu University Faculty of Medicine. Data were retrieved from the hospital patient information and management system (HBYS—Hospital Information Management System) and the standard patient record forms used in the Department of Anesthesiology, including demographic, biochemical, and clinical variables of these patients, which were analyzed. 2.2. Definition of Achalasia In our center, the diagnosis of achalasia was established by evaluating the clinical presentation, radiological imaging, endoscopic examination, and HRM findings together. The criteria included (i) typical symptoms such as progressive dysphagia (for solids and liquids), regurgitation, chest pain, and/or weight loss; (ii) timed barium esophagogram showing a bird-beak appearance at the GEJ and proximal esophageal dilation, consistent with achalasia (esophageal caliber was considered normal if ≤4 cm, mildly dilated if 4.1–6 cm, and markedly dilated if >6 cm or if the distal esophagus had a sigmoid configuration); (iii) endoscopic observation of a tightly closed LES without mucosal abnormalities or evidence of mechanical obstruction; (iv) HRM showing elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP > 15 mmHg) and absence of peristalsis, with subtype classification into Type I, II, or III [ 47 48 49 2.3. Preoperative Preparation and Anesthesia Protocol Patients fasted for 24–36 h prior to surgery. Esophageal clearance with EGD was performed in 30 cases before transfer to the operating room. No premedication was administered. Upon arrival, routine monitoring (ECG, SpO 2 2 36 50 51 2 2 2 2 36 2.4. POEM Procedure All procedures were performed under general anesthesia with prophylactic administration of 30 mg/kg (maximum 2000 mg) intravenous cefazolin sodium at induction [ 52 53 2 2 49 49 54 49 49 55 49 56 49 57 2.5. Collected Variables and Outcome Measures The study parameters included age, gender, comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and chronic pulmonary diseases), American Society of Anesthesiologists status (ASA) scores, and biochemical analyses (measured both preoperatively and before discharge). Additional data included anesthetic agents used, duration of the POEM procedure and anesthesia, postoperative analgesic protocols, ICU and hospital stay durations, and follow-up period. Intraoperative parameters measured during POEM included ETCO 2 2 2.6. Study Protocol and Ethics Committee Approval This retrospective study involving human participants was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committees and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Ethical approval for this non-interventional study was obtained from the Inonu University Institutional Review Board (IRB) under protocol number 7899, dated 7 May 2025. All participants provided both verbal and written informed consent prior to undergoing the POEM procedure. The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines were followed to enhance reporting transparency and reduce potential bias in this study [ 58 2.7. Biostatistical Analysis The statistical analysis for this study was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics—including means, standard deviations, and percentile values—were used to summarize the data. Continuous variables are presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR: Q1–Q3) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI: lower–upper limits). These statistical measures were used to identify clinically meaningful thresholds and assess variability in physiological parameters during anesthesia management in POEM procedures. For repeated measurements involving two time points, the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences between preoperative and postoperative values. For variables measured at three or more time points, the Friedman two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied to evaluate overall changes across the perioperative period. Statistical significance was set at a two-tailed p 3. Results A detailed overview of the study results is provided in Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 A total of 51 patients underwent POEM during the study period. The median age was 48 years (IQR: 40–63), and there was a slight predominance of female patients (52.9%). The most common blood group was 0 Rh(+) (45.1%), followed by B Rh(+) (27.5%), A Rh(+) (23.5%), and AB Rh(+) (3.9%). The median height and weight were 164 cm (IQR: 160–173) and 55 kg (IQR: 50–63), respectively. Regarding preoperative risk status, 64.7% of patients were classified as ASA II, while 35.3% were ASA III. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities, affecting 31.4% and 11.8% of the POEM patients, respectively. These findings suggest a predominance of moderate-risk patients with manageable systemic disease undergoing POEM ( Table 1 In terms of intraoperative parameters, the median duration of anesthesia was 180 min (IQR: 165–185), indicating that POEM is a time-consuming but stable endoscopic procedure. The median PIP was 25 mmHg (IQR: 25–26), showing no evidence of excessive airway pressure during ventilation. SpO 2 2 Table 2 Blood pressure showed transient intraoperative hypotension: systolic BP declined from a median of 124 mmHg (IQR: 115–133) to 96 mmHg (IQR: 88–109) at 10 min, then partially recovered to 108 mmHg (IQR: 97–119). Diastolic and mean arterial pressures (MAP) followed similar dynamics, with MAP decreasing from 88 mmHg (IQR: 81–96) to 71 mmHg (IQR: 65–78), then recovering to 76 mmHg (IQR: 70–86). These fluctuations remained within safe anesthetic limits and were managed without pharmacologic intervention ( Table 2 Significant changes were observed in physiological parameters measured at three different perioperative time points. According to the Friedman two-way ANOVA test, SpO 2 2 p 2 p 2 p p p p p p p p p Functional esophageal parameters revealed a median basal LES pressure of 23.4 mmHg (IQR: 18.0–34.0) and a basal UES pressure of 51.0 mmHg (IQR: 33.0–60.0), consistent with hypercontractile esophageal disorders. The mean incisor-to-LES distance was 40.2 cm (IQR: 38.5–41.5), which is important for intraoperative measurement and myotomy planning. The median length of hospital stay was 2 days (IQR: 1–3), suggesting favorable recovery and early discharge in most patients. Preoperative and postoperative hematologic parameters were comparatively analyzed. There was a statistically significant increase in WBC (from 7.4 to 10.7 × 10 9 p 9 p p p 9 p p Table 3 Perioperative and early postoperative complications were generally mild and self-limiting, with 27 events observed across 22 (43.1%) patients, indicating that some individuals experienced more than one adverse event during the perioperative period. These complications were identified through a combination of clinical evaluation and radiologic imaging, allowing for comprehensive assessment and timely intervention when necessary. The most frequent early complication was subcutaneous emphysema (19.6%), followed by minor bleeding (9.8%), pneumoperitoneum (7.84%), pleural effusion (5.88%), pneumothorax (3.92%), and pneumomediastinum (3.92%). Two patients required tube thoracostomy due to pneumothorax. Only one case of major bleeding (1.96%) was observed, and it was managed conservatively. Notably, no patient developed a complication severe enough to require surgical exploration. During a median follow-up of 546 days (IQR: 374–965), no procedure-related mortality was observed. Long-term complications were rare and included symptomatic GERD in two patients (3.92%) and endoscopic esophagitis in one patient (1.96%). These findings confirm that POEM is associated with a low incidence of severe complications and favorable long-term outcomes ( Table 2 4. Discussion POEM is a minimally invasive endoscopic treatment for achalasia and other esophageal motility disorders. It consists of mucosal incision, submucosal tunneling, and myotomy across the GEJ, followed by endoscopic clip closure of the mucosal entry. Emerging evidence consistently shows that POEM is best performed under general endotracheal anesthesia rather than sedation, primarily to reduce aspiration and CO 2 36 59 2 2 2 2 36 39 While POEM is generally recognized as safe and effective, there are some patient groups for whom POEM would not be appropriate in an endoscopy unit and may require operating room conditions. Patients with complex anatomy or previous surgery in the upper gastrointestinal tract may have adhesions or altered anatomy that make it difficult to safely perform POEM in the endoscopy unit. In such cases, the procedure may be better suited for an operating room with more space and equipment. Patients with significant comorbidities, such as severe cardiopulmonary disease or bleeding disorders, may benefit from the controlled environment of an or where additional medical support and resources are readily available. In our hospital, POEM procedures are safely performed in the operating room with multidisciplinary support, although the endoscopy unit has an anesthesia device and equipment to respond to all emergencies. Perioperative pulmonary aspiration is a rare but potentially serious cause of anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality and is one of the leading anesthetic challenges. It is also among the primary causes of death from pulmonary complications. The most important factor in the induction of anesthesia in patients with achalasia is the prevention of aspiration. Aspiration occurs in approximately 3/10,000 anesthesia procedures, with a higher frequency in special patient groups and emergencies [ 36 60 61 36 37 59 62 63 64 65 During the procedure, CO 2 2 2 2 37 37 2 2 2 2 2 2 66 2 2 POEM-related complications can be categorized into early and late complications. The most frequent early complications include subcutaneous emphysema (4.9–7.5%), pneumoperitoneum (6.8–15.5%), pleural effusion (0.9–1.2%), pneumothorax (1.2%), pneumomediastinum (1.1–1.8%), mucosal injury (1.5–4.8%), major or minor bleeding (0.2–0.6%), and esophageal perforation (0.2–0.3%) [ 41 67 68 67 69 70 71 72 73 2 36 59 36 2 2 2 As can be understood from the low doses of opioids we use in induction, this procedure is not stimulating in itself. In these procedures, post-procedural pain is generally not an issue [ 37 74 Routine preoperative endoscopy, although considered the gold standard for assessing esophageal clearance, was not included in our protocol due to its invasive nature and practical limitations. This absence may represent a limitation in terms of aspiration risk assessment, as it introduces uncertainty regarding residual esophageal contents [ 37 37 75 76 77 78 Another important aspect worth discussing is whether routine ICU monitoring is necessary for all patients undergoing POEM. Although all patients in our study were monitored in the ICU for 24 h postoperatively, we acknowledge that this approach may not be applicable across all healthcare systems, particularly those with limited ICU availability. Our approach is also supported by a study that have emphasized the role of close postoperative monitoring, especially during the early phase of implementing a new protocol, in order not to overlook early postoperative complications [ 59 79 80 Limitations This study has several limitations. First, it was conducted at a single tertiary care center with a relatively small sample size, which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Second, its retrospective design introduces potential biases, including reliance on the accuracy and completeness of recorded data, which may have led to underreporting of intraoperative events. Finally, long-term follow-up beyond the reported median period was not available for all patients. Future prospective, multicenter studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these findings. 5. Conclusions This study demonstrates that POEM can be performed safely and effectively under general anesthesia when supported by structured multidisciplinary collaboration and vigilant intraoperative monitoring.
