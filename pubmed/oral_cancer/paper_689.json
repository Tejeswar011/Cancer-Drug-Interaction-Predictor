HOXA11-AS expression was quantified in paired ESCC tumor tissues (n = 50) and adjacent histologically normal tissues (> 5 cm from tumor margin) (n=50) from surgical patients. The relationship between HOXA11-AS expression levels, clinical staging and patient survival was analyzed. Lentiviral transduction was employed to generate stable ESCC cell lines with HOXA11-AS overexpression (lv-HOXA11-AS) or knockdown (sh-HOXA11-AS), accompanied by negative control groups (lv-NC/sh-NC). The impact on malignant phenotype was assessed via CCK-8 proliferation assays, Transwell migration/invasion assays, wound healing assays, and flow cytometry for apoptosis. In vivo tumor growth was evaluated by subcutaneously injecting fluorescently labeled lv-HOXA11-AS or lv-NC cells into BALB/c-nu mice. RNA-sequencing and tissue qRT-PCR confirmed significantly higher HOXA11-AS expression in ESCC versus normal epithelium, and high HOXA11-AS expression was associated with advanced tumor stage and was identified as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. qRT-PCR validated the elevated expression of HOXA11-AS in ESCC cell lines too. HOXA11-AS overexpression promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and suppressed early apoptosis in ESCC cells, HOXA11-AS knockdown exerted opposing effects. HOXA11-AS overexpression significantly enhanced tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. LncRNA HOXA11-AS is aberrantly overexpressed in ESCC and functions as an oncogene, driving tumor progression by enhancing proliferation, migration, invasion and suppressing apoptosis. Its association with poor prognosis identifies HOXA11-AS as a promising prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ESCC.

The LncRNA HOXA11-AS with the highest expression was screened for subsequent study. In addition, 50 pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent tissues of ESCC patients confirmed by pathology were collected to detect whether the expression of HOXA11-AS in ESCC tumor tissues and adjacent tissues was statistically different by qRT-PCR, and further verified in ESCC cell lines. Univariate regression analysis showed that HOXA11-AS could be used as an independent prognostic predictor for survival time, TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Lentivirus was used to construct HOXA11-AS overexpression, knockdown and negative control models. CCK-8, Transwell, wound healing assays and flow cytometry were used to detect the regulatory effect of HOXA11-AS expression level on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of ESCC cells. Immunodeficient mice were used to detect the effect of HOXA11-AS overexpression on tumor growth in vivo. Method Clinical data and specimen acquisition The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients aged over 18 years, pathologically diagnosed with ESCC, without a history of prior surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, esophageal-related diseases, or other tumors.

The relationships between HOXA11-AS and ESCC patient outcome, TNM stage, age, gender, location, differentiation and lymph node metastasis were analyzed. It was found that HOXA11-AS could be used as an independent predictor of ESCC patient outcome and TNM stage. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to further explore the role of HOXA11-AS in the tumorigenesis and progression of ESCC. Overexpression(lv-HOXA11-AS), knockdown(sh-HOXA11-AS) and negative control models(lv-NC/sh-NC) were constructed in ECA-109, KYSE150 and TE-1 cell lines, and the related cell phenotypes were verified. The results showed that overexpression of HOXA11-AS promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells, and inhibited the late apoptosis of ESCC cells, while knockdown of HOXA11-AS reversed the above effects. In vivo experiments were further carried out in BALB/c-nu mice. The experimental results showed that overexpression of HOXA11-AS promoted ESCC tumor proliferation in vivo. This study demonstrated the high expression of HOXA11-AS in ESCC, revealing the strong predictive role of HOXA11-AS as an oncogene in ESCC outcome and TNM staging. Furthermore, HOXA11-AS as a new biomarker and prognostic predictor of ESCC has been demonstrated to promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion, apoptosis in vitro, and tumorigenesis in vivo. The treatment approach for ESCC has shifted from endoscopic treatment and surgical treatment to the molecular mechanism level 21 22 24 25 26 15 17 19 27 30 20 13 25 31 32 33 19 34 35 36 37 38 25 39 40 41 Conclusion This study found that LncRNA HOXA11-AS is highly expressed in ESCC and can be used as an independent predictor of prognosis and TNM staging of ESCC patients. As a tumor promoter, HOXA11-AS promoted ESCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and tumor growth in vivo. The above effects could be reversed by knocking down its expression. It is suggested that HOXA11-AS may play an important role in the occurrence and development of ESCC as a new biomarker and therapeutic target.
