Recent evidence implicates the gut microbiota as a key mediator in this relationship, operating through a microbiota–gut–metabolic axis that influences host metabolism, immune function, and circadian regulation. Mechanistic studies reveal that social jetlag disrupts microbial rhythmicity, reduces short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, impairs intestinal barrier function, and promotes systemic inflammation, which contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Clinical and preclinical interventions, including time-restricted feeding (TRF)/time-restricted eating (TRE), probiotics or melatonin supplementation, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), demonstrate the potential to restore microbial and metabolic homeostasis by realigning host and microbial rhythms. This review synthesizes mechanistic insights with emerging human and clinical evidence, highlighting the gut microbiota as a novel target for chronotherapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the metabolic consequences of circadian disruption. Recognizing and treating circadian–microbiome misalignment may provide a clinically actionable pathway to prevent or reverse chronic metabolic diseases in modern populations. social jetlag gut microbiota circadian rhythms metabolic dysfunction chronotherapy microbiota–gut–brain axis This work received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction In recent decades, artificial lighting, digital screens, and irregular work schedules have disrupted human circadian rhythms. Social jetlag (SJL) is a common result. It is defined as the difference in sleep midpoint between workdays and free days, measured in hours. SJL reflects chronic misalignment between an individual’s biological clock and social demands, such as work or school schedules [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 13 14 Microbial communities have their own circadian rhythms. SJL-induced misalignment disrupts these oscillations. This creates a cycle of host–microbe dysfunction, amplifying metabolic issues. This review explores how SJL impairs metabolic health. It emphasizes the gut microbiota’s role. We distinguish SJL-specific findings from broader circadian disruption models, such as shift work or jetlag simulations. Additionally, we integrate human clinical and animal research. Such research assesses how circadian desynchrony alters microbial rhythms. These changes, in turn, affect metabolic pathways. We focus on microbial metabolites, intestinal permeability, and immune signaling. We discuss chronotherapeutic interventions like time-restricted eating (TRE), probiotics, and lifestyle changes. These interventions aim to realign circadian and microbial rhythms to reduce metabolic risk. We also outline research challenges and future directions for chronobiome science in clinical practice. Evidence links circadian disruption and gut microbiota to metabolic disease. Yet, gaps remain. Few studies directly explore SJL’s impact on gut microbial function. Most evidence comes from broader circadian misalignment models. Mechanistic pathways in humans are not fully defined. Intervention studies targeting SJL-related microbial and metabolic outcomes are scarce. By focusing on SJL as a distinct phenomenon, this review offers a new framework. It integrates SJL with the microbiota–gut–metabolic axis. This highlights opportunities for chronotherapeutic and microbiome-based interventions. 2. Social Jetlag and Its Physiological Impact Modern societies face widespread exposure to artificial light and variable schedules. These cause a mismatch between intrinsic circadian rhythms and external routines. This mismatch is known as SJL. SJL occurs when the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) desynchronizes from peripheral clocks in organs like the liver, gut, pancreas, and adipose tissue. It is quantified by differences in sleep midpoint between workdays and free days. Over half of adults experience shifts of 1 to 2 h [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Evidence links circadian disruption to altered glucose homeostasis. The New Hoorn Study included 1499 Dutch adults. More pronounced SJL reduced insulin sensitivity and raised fasting glucose levels; this was independent of chronotype or sleep duration and suggests a higher T2D risk [ 22 23 24 5 Chronic inflammation mediates circadian misalignment’s metabolic effects. Observational studies show higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in those with variable sleep schedules. This may stem from stress, dietary irregularities, or immune–metabolic dysfunction [ 25 26 24 24 The gut microbiota plays a central role in circadian alignment/misalignment. Microbial communities follow daily oscillations in composition and activity. Host feeding and activity cycles influence these rhythms. Disrupted sleep and meal timing desynchronize microbial rhythms. This reduces beneficial taxa and impairs intestinal barrier integrity. It also promotes endotoxemia, contributing to insulin resistance and inflammation [ 9 12 3. The Gut Microbiota and Circadian Rhythms The gut microbiota is a dynamic community in the gastrointestinal tract. It shows strong daily oscillations in composition, distribution, and metabolic output. These rhythms align with the host’s circadian system. The SCN and peripheral intestinal clocks govern this alignment [ 13 27 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes 28 29 Per2 Bmal1 13 27 30 SJL disrupts microbial rhythmicity. Inconsistent sleep and meal timing, common in shift workers, disturb microbial community structure. This reduces SCFA-producing taxa, like Ruminococcaceae Lachnospiraceae Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Roseburia 31 13 28 32 33 34 ALAN also plays a role. ALAN suppresses melatonin secretion. Melatonin is critical for host–microbe circadian synchronization. Mechanistic insights support melatonin’s role in microbial regulation. However, direct links between ALAN-induced melatonin suppression and dysbiosis need further study [ 35 36 37 38 11 28 39 Human data support these findings. High Prevotella 40 41 42 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 43 44 45 46 4. Mechanisms Linking Social Jetlag, Gut Microbiota, and Metabolic Dysfunction In circadian alignment, the gut microbiota shows robust daily oscillations in composition and activity. Host feeding patterns and clock gene expression in murine models drive these rhythms [ 28 47 11 28 Lachnospiraceae Ruminococcaceae Eubacterium rectale Anaerostipes Time-restricted feeding (TRF) aligns food intake with the active phase [ 48 13 48 49 28 50 51 Metabolic niches in the gut microbiome shape host physiology. These niches are vulnerable to circadian disruption and SJL. Fiber fermenters like Faecalibacterium Roseburia 52 53 Clostridium Bacteroides 54 55 Akkermansia muciniphila 56 57 33 The gut microbiome influences host physiology through metabolic activity. It produces bioactive compounds. Dietary fiber fermentation yields SCFAs like acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These support barrier integrity, regulate metabolism, and modulate immune tone [ 53 58 55 33 59 60 61 33 Enterobacteriaceae 62 63 64 Akkermansia muciniphila 33 56 57 65 66 Therapeutic microbiota manipulation shows promise. Berberine, administered in high-fat-diet-fed rats, increased their SCFA-producing bacteria like Bacteroides Clostridium Firmicutes Bacteroidetes 67 68 Bacillus subtilis 69 70 Desulfovibrionaceae 71 Immune and epigenetic mechanisms link SJL to metabolic outcomes. Mukherji et al. identified a bidirectional axis between microbial signals and host circadian genes like Per2 Bmal1 27 72 73 74 75 SJL alters behavioral rhythms, triggering microbial dysregulation. This reduces SCFA output, impairs barrier integrity, and increases inflammation. These lead to metabolic disturbances. A controlled human study showed acute sleep–wake cycle shifts altered gut microbiota functionality [ 76 Gut microbial biotransformations have clinical significance. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Roseburia 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 5. Clinical Evidence Linking Social Jetlag and Gut Microbiota to Metabolic Outcomes Emerging clinical evidence suggests that circadian misalignment due to SJL may modulate gut microbiota composition with implications for metabolic health. In the ZOE PREDICT 1 study, which included 934 adults, individuals with ≥1.5 h of SJL showed significant alterations in 17 microbial species, several of which were linked to adverse metabolic phenotypes. Although α-diversity and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c, a clinical marker of average blood glucose over the past three months and an indicator of diabetes risk) levels remained unchanged, the SJL group demonstrated modest increases in inflammatory biomarkers, including glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) and IL-6, suggesting a link between circadian misalignment, diet-associated microbial changes, and low-grade systemic inflammation [ 51 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes 84 85 TRF or time-restricted eating (TRE), dietary patterns that align food intake with circadian rhythms, have shown promising metabolic benefits in human clinical trials. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of overweight individuals with T2D, a 10-h TRF/TRE intervention led to a 0.7% reduction in HbA1c and favorable shifts in lipid profiles. It also increased the abundance of Prevotella 86 87 88 Faecalibacterium Blautia 89 50 90 91 Animal studies have clarified the underlying mechanisms. In mice, TRF was shown to restore diurnal rhythms in gut microbial composition and enhance metabolic parameters, even under a high-fat diet [ 13 92 Bacillus subtilis 69 These results highlight the potential of microbial-derived metabolites, particularly SCFAs like butyrate, as key effectors in metabolic and circadian regulation [ 93 12 9 Taken together, these studies from human cohorts and animal models show the presence of a dynamic and reciprocal relationship between circadian rhythms, gut microbiota, and metabolic function. Disruptions to this relationship, as seen in SJL, can trigger microbial imbalances that contribute to systemic inflammation and metabolic impairment. Circadian misalignment may therefore cause gut dysbiosis and promote metabolic dysfunction ( Figure 1 6. Chronotherapeutic Innovations Targeting the Gut Microbiota Chronotherapy, the strategic alignment of treatment timing with circadian rhythms, has gained attention for its potential to modulate the gut microbiota and improve metabolic outcomes [ 62 94 Table 1 Probiotics and prebiotics are foundational interventions to modulate gut microbial communities [ 95 Lactobacillus reuteri 96 97 TRF/TRE, as forms of dietary chronotherapy, restrict food intake to a consistent daily window. TRF/TRE align feeding rhythms with metabolic and microbial activity, restoring rhythmicity in microbial diversity and function. This acts primarily by promoting SCFA-producing taxa and reinforcing circadian regulation of hepatic and adipose metabolic genes [ 98 91 92 FMT provides a direct method of microbiome restoration with chronotherapeutic potential. A 2023 RCT in humans demonstrated that FMT from metabolically healthy donors improved blood pressure and increased Lactobacillus 99 Melatonin, a key circadian hormone, also plays a role in regulating gut microbiota composition. In mice subjected to sleep restriction, melatonin supplementation restored microbial rhythmicity and reduced endotoxin-producing taxa. Melatonin synchronizes central and microbial clocks, reduces Firmicutes Bacteroidetes 100 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Akkermansia 101 Pharmacological agents that modulate microbial-derived signaling pathways offer another potential chronotherapeutic approach [ 102 103 104 105 106 Collectively, these studies illustrate that aligning microbial-targeted therapies with circadian timing enhances both the efficacy and durability of metabolic improvements. Probiotic timing, TRF/TRE, FMT, melatonin, and pharmacological strategies all offer distinct yet synergistic mechanisms for restoring gut and host rhythmicity [ 107 108 7. Challenges and Future Directions Despite compelling evidence linking circadian misalignment, gut microbial dysbiosis, and metabolic dysfunction, several pivotal challenges must be addressed to advance the translational potential of this field. A major barrier to effective chronobiome-based interventions is the marked variability in gut microbiota composition among individuals [ 109 110 111 112 113 51 73 114 115 116 117 In addition to interindividual variation, the current body of evidence is constrained by methodological limitations. Many of the mechanistic insights in this field are derived from rodent models, which, while valuable, do not fully capture human circadian or microbial complexity [ 118 119 120 While numerous studies have identified associations between SJL, microbial dysbiosis, and adverse metabolic outcomes, causal mechanisms remain insufficiently characterized [ 121 122 123 A large body of research in this domain relies on murine models under controlled light–dark cycles, restricted diets, and genetically uniform microbiomes. However, human circadian physiology and microbiota ecology differ substantially from those of rodents. As a result, translating findings from animal models to clinical applications remains challenging [ 124 125 Real-time monitoring of circadian misalignment and gut microbiota shifts remains technically challenging and logistically complex. However, recent advances in wearable technology, including sleep trackers, continuous glucose monitors, and ingestible biosensors, offer opportunities for dynamic tracking of circadian phenotypes and metabolic biomarkers [ 126 127 The production of SCFAs, secondary bile acids, and other microbial metabolites follows diurnal rhythms and may regulate peripheral clocks via nuclear receptor signaling [ 105 12 128 Sex, age, chronotype, and shift work history all influence circadian and microbial dynamics. Stratified analyses and subgroup-specific interventions will be crucial to avoid one-size-fits-all models. For example, older adults exhibit dampened circadian amplitudes and reduced microbiota diversity, potentially altering their responsiveness to TRF/TRE or timed supplementation [ 129 Beyond probiotics and TRF/TRE, emerging circadian-aligned interventions also include prebiotics, FMT, and nuclear receptor agonists. Prebiotics, non-digestible fibers that modulate the gut microbiota, can influence microbial diurnal oscillations and enhance metabolite rhythms relevant to host metabolic homeostasis. Animal studies have shown that specific prebiotics such as inulin can reinforce microbial rhythmicity and synchronize peripheral clocks, though human data remain limited [ 9 13 130 Future research should adopt a systems-level framework, integrating microbiome science, chrononutrition, endocrinology, and behavioral health. Machine learning techniques applied to multi-omics datasets could identify predictive signatures of circadian–microbiome misalignment and treatment responsiveness. Personalized chronotherapeutic platforms may eventually leverage an individual’s circadian phenotype, microbial configuration, and metabolic profile to guide interventions. In sum, while the interplay of circadian rhythms, social behavior, and the gut microbiome holds great promise for combating metabolic disease, clinical translation will require coordinated advances in mechanistic research, digital health, and personalized intervention design. 8. Conclusions Social jetlag (SJL) represents a prevalent and quantifiable form of circadian misalignment with important implications for metabolic health. Emerging evidence highlights the gut microbiota as a key intermediary, linking SJL-induced desynchrony to inflammation, altered metabolite production, and impaired host metabolism. While mechanistic insights are often drawn from broader circadian disruption models, SJL-specific studies suggest comparable pathways and underscore its public health relevance. Interventions such as time-restricted eating, probiotics, and melatonin offer promising avenues for restoring circadian–microbial alignment, though targeted clinical studies remain limited. Addressing these research gaps will be essential to establish causality and to guide effective chronotherapeutic strategies.

Bile acids induce energy expenditure by promoting intracellular thyroid hormone activation Nature 2006 439 484 489 10.1038/nature04330 16400329 Figure 1 Schematic representation of the pathophysiological cascade linking social jetlag to metabolic dysfunction via the gut microbiota. Social jetlag, characterized by disrupted sleep and eating patterns, induces circadian misalignment that impairs gut microbial rhythmicity and composition. This dysbiosis is marked by decreased production of SCFAs, increased intestinal permeability, and elevated LPS translocation, collectively promoting systemic inflammation. The resulting immune activation contributes to insulin resistance and obesity. Additionally, suppression of melatonin and altered clock gene expression further exacerbate circadian and metabolic disturbances. Three interconnected feedback loops shape this pathophysiological network, each represented by color-coded arrows in the diagram. The orange loop highlights the central circadian pathway, in which social jetlag reduces melatonin secretion and disrupts the function of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), initiating microbial dysbiosis and subsequent metabolic impairment. The light blue loop traces the inflammatory–metabolic axis, where dysbiosis leads to systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction—processes that in turn can impair host circadian control and reinforce microbial instability. The golden-brown loop captures the reciprocal interaction between gut microbiota and peripheral circadian clock gene expression: microbial imbalance disrupts clock gene rhythmicity in peripheral tissues, which feeds back to destabilize microbial oscillations and inflammatory responses. This model emphasizes the bidirectional crosstalk among the gut microbiota, host circadian systems, and immune–metabolic regulation in the development of disease states associated with circadian disruption.

Current chronotherapeutic interventions designed to modulate the gut microbiota in alignment with host circadian rhythms. Each strategy—ranging from probiotic and prebiotic administration to TRF, FMT, melatonin supplementation, and pharmacological modulation of bile acid pathways—targets microbial composition or function to restore metabolic homeostasis. Evidence from human and animal studies indicates that aligning these therapies with circadian timing enhances their effectiveness in improving glycemic control, reducing inflammation, and modulating gut-derived signaling. Abbreviations: PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome; MetS, metabolic syndrome; FXR, farnesoid X receptor. Intervention Mechanism of Action Observed Benefits Timed Probiotic Supplementation Aligns probiotic activity with host circadian rhythms. Improved glycemic control and sleep quality in circadian-disrupted individuals. Prebiotic Intake inulin Enhances growth of beneficial microbes; synchronizes microbial metabolism. Reduced insulin resistance and inflammation in women with PCOS. Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF)/Time-Restricted Eating (TRE) Restricts food intake to active phase; restores microbial rhythmicity and metabolic gene expression. Improved insulin sensitivity and oxidative stress markers; protection against obesity in animal models. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) Replaces dysbiotic microbiota; modifies microbial composition and function. Increased Lactobacillus Melatonin Supplementation Synchronizes central and microbial clocks; modulates gut microbiota composition. Decreased Firmicutes Bacteroidetes FXR Agonists fexaramine Targets bile acid signaling to influence gut–liver axis and microbial ecology. Enhanced insulin sensitivity; increased adipose browning; circadian timing may augment efficacy. Combined Chronotherapy Approaches Leverages multiple synchronized interventions (e.g., TRF + probiotics) to enhance host–microbe circadian alignment. Synergistic improvements in metabolic, inflammatory, and microbial parameters. ",
