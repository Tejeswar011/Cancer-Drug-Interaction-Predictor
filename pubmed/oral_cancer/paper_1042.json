Introduction There are many members of the genus Mycobacterium 1 Mycobacterium marinum Mycobacterium leprae M. marinum 2 M. leprae M. marinum 3 1.1. Mycobacterium marinum M. marinum 4 5 Cutaneous infection most often begins as a solitary erythematous or violaceous papule or nodule at the site of inoculation, typically on the hands or upper extremities. Over time, these lesions may ulcerate, form crusts, or take on a verrucous appearance. In some cases, lesions may spread proximally along lymphatic channels in a sporotrichoid pattern. While the disease is generally limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissues in immunocompetent individuals, more invasive manifestations, such as tenosynovitis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis, may develop, especially with delayed diagnosis or in immunocompromised hosts [ 6 7 Diagnosing this infection can be challenging. The infection often progresses slowly and may mimic other granulomatous diseases. Culturing this bacterium requires incubation at cooler temperatures (32 °C), and biopsy specimens typically reveal granulomatous inflammation with acid-fast bacilli. The prognosis is generally favorable with timely recognition and prolonged antibiotic therapy. However, recurrence may happen if treatment is interrupted. More advanced cases that affect the joints or bone may necessitate surgical debridement in addition to the standard antimicrobial treatment. Timely diagnosis is critical because delayed recognition increases the risk of deeper tissue involvement and long-term impairment [ 4 5 6 1.2. Mycobacterium leprae M. leprae M. marinum, M. leprae M. leprae M. marinum Figure 1 8 9 M. leprae 9 10 11 12 In addition to the dermatologic manifestations, nerve involvement is a key feature of disease progression. The infection of Schwann cells leads to peripheral neuropathy, resulting in symptoms such as numbness and muscle weakness. If left untreated, this can cause significant disability due to motor impairment and deformities. The degree of nerve damage often correlates with the specific form of the disease; for instance, patients with tuberculoid leprosy may experience localized nerve impairment, whereas those with lepromatous disease typically present with widespread and symmetric nerve involvement. Chronic inflammation and repeated trauma to anesthetic areas may lead to secondary injuries, ulcers, and erosion of the bone in the digits [ 2 8 10 Diagnostic procedures rely on a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory confirmation. Skin smears and biopsies may detect acid-fast bacilli, while histopathological analysis frequently exhibits granulomatous inflammation with varying bacterial loads, dependent on the type of disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can detect M. leprae 2 The prognosis is significantly influenced by the promptness of diagnosis and the initiation of treatment. Early intervention with multidrug regimens can halt disease progression and prevent disability, whereas delayed recognition heightens the risk of irreversible nerve damage and lasting impairment. Despite the drastic reduction in prevalence worldwide due to multidrug therapy, untreated or late-treated cases continue to pose a substantial cause of morbidity in endemic regions [ 2 10 11 2. Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature review to examine the pathogenesis of cutaneous infections caused by M. marinum M. leprae, 3. Entry, Invasion, and Tropism M. marinum M. leprae M. marinum 6 13 M. leprae M. leprae 8 11 4. Oxidative Stress in Cutaneous Mycobacterial Infection 4.1. Reactive Oxygen Species and Host Defenses As the body encounters invading pathogens such as bacteria, Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in the host’s innate immune response. Phagocytic cells, including neutrophils and macrophages detect microbial components such as lipoproteins primarily through recognitions by toll-like receptors. This recognition triggers the host immune system and stimulates the production of ROS [ 14 15 Phagocytes contain a membrane-associated NADPH oxidase complex, that when activated initiates the process known as respiratory burst and the subsequent production of ROS [ 16 17 phox phox 2 − 2 − 2 2 1 2 18 These ROS exert antimicrobial activity through multiple mechanisms. Oxidative stress induced by ROS can damage microbial DNA through strand breaks or base modification. Additionally, ROS can disrupt lipid membranes through a process known as lipid peroxidation. The oxidation of proteins can lead to inactivation of key bacterial enzymes. Collectively, ROS can compromise pathogen’s structural integrity and function, as well as facilitate the clearance of the pathogen by the host immune system [ 19 20 21 4.2. ROS and Immune Modulation ROS are not merely destructive agents; they also act as crucial intracellular messengers that guide immune cell decisions. While often associated with damage, physiological concentrations of ROS serve as vital signaling molecules that can shape the adaptive immune response, rather than solely acting as antimicrobials [ 22 23 T cells, which are critical to the adaptive immune response, exemplify this intricate regulation. When an antigen stimulates the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD80/CD86 binds to CD28, T cells secrete cytokines like interleukin-2 (IL-2). This induces the activation of transcription factor Akt. Akt then initiates the mTOR pathway, causing a shift in cellular energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. The increase in nutrient uptake and glucose metabolism promotes the proliferation of naïve T cells. While CD4+ T-cell differentiation depends largely on aerobic glycolysis, specific subsets like regulatory T cells rely on fatty acid oxidation instead [ 24 25 ROS, as byproducts of oxidative metabolism rapidly increase during T-cell activation due to heightened energy demands. ROS is produced from mitochondrial Complexes I, Complex III, and NADPH oxidase. Specifically, medium or low concentrations of ROS act as intracellular signaling molecules, regulating TCR signaling components such as Lck and ZAP-70 [ 25 26 2 2 25 27 28 However, the beneficial role of ROS is concentration-dependent, as excessive intracellular or extracellular ROS production in innate immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), can lead to detrimental effects. While such ROS production is associated with antigen presenting cell formation and activation, it ultimately leads to T cell suppression, partially mediated by the upregulation of the co-inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). This shift results in macrophages acquiring an immunosuppressive phenotype and secreting immunosuppressive cytokines, often in response to ROS inducers [ 29 30 31 4.3. Immune Suppression in M. leprae Infection This T cell suppression observed with excessive ROS, is critical in M. leprae M. leprae M. leprae 32 33 Therefore, excessive ROS leading to immune dysregulation impairs the adaptive immune response and promotes bacterial persistence. This underscores the critical need for redox balance, which the immune system relies on antioxidant systems to maintain. The dual role of ROS, shown in Figure 2 34 4.4. Redox Imbalance in M. leprae In leprosy, phagocyte activation leads to production of ROS. While intended to control infection, this can lead to collateral damage to host tissues through lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant glutathione (GSH) plays a crucial role in protecting the cells and neutralizing excessive ROS [ 35 36 One study assessed the blood GSH content in 100 patients with leprosy and compared them to 50 healthy controls. GSH levels were measured and estimated using the DTNB [5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid)] reduction method. Enzyme activity of GSH-Px and GR were measured in the red blood cell hemolysate by kinetic methods. The results showed that GSH, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GR) were significantly lower in leprosy patients. The study also noted a progressive decreasing trend in GSH levels and enzyme activity with increasing levels of bacteriological index. This suggests that M. leprae 37 4.5. Redox Imbalances in M. marinum In early stages of M. marinum M. marinum 38 As infection progresses, excess tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was seen in the zebrafish models to stimulate ROS production and activate Cyclophilin D, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore regulator, triggering programmed necrosis of infected macrophages. This cascade of mitochondrial ROS production led to the activation of lysosomal enzyme and Bel-2-associated X protein (BAX), subsequently stimulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ryanodine receptors to cause a flow of calcium into the mitochondrion. This calcium overload causes Cyclophilin D-mediated necrosis [ 39 40 39 41 M. marinum M. marinum 42 43 44 The importance of ROS in controlling M. marinum M. marinum 45 46 These findings highlight a distinct pathogenic strategy where redox manipulation is important not only for the pathogenesis of M. marinum M. marinum M. leprae 5. Oxidative Stress and the Skin 5.1. ROS and Skin Aging Aging, as manifested on the skin, results in significant changes in its structure, function, and appearance. ROS are associated with a core mechanism mediating skin aging, leading to lipid, protein, nucleic acid, and organelles damage. Many studies assess the effects of ultraviolet radiation, where the underlying mechanism involves an increase in ROS damaging skin structure, skin function, and mediating inflammatory responses [ 47 48 49 48 50 5.2. ROS on Skin Wound Healing Beyond general aging, localized oxidative stress significantly impairs wound healing. When assessing foot ulcers due to diabetes mellitus, there are many factors that may play a role. However, there is a high influence and association to oxidative stress such that imbalance in free radicals and antioxidants, through the overproduction ROS can delay wound healing [ 51 51 52 Recognizing this, in addition to antimicrobial treatment, decreasing ROS to reduce oxidative stress and improve healing are crucial targets in the care of M. leprae M. marinum 6. Glutathione 6.1. Glutathione Role in Redox Balance GSH is essential for maintaining redox homeostasis and removing ROS. GSH’s ability to be easily oxidized and dehydrogenated through its thiol group, allows it to effectively scavenge and eliminate free radicals. Furthermore, GSH also provides essential electrons for enzymes like GSH-Px, which reduce the level of ROS by facilitating H 2 2 53 54 6.2. Glutathione in Immune Regulation This crucial role in redox control becomes particularly significant during immune responses. As ROS levels increase during T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement, GSH synthesis also increases. This heightened GSH production works to counteract the potentially detrimental effects of excessive ROS, thereby significantly impacting T-cell survival and function. Notably, this increased de novo GSH synthesis actively suppresses Th17 differentiation while simultaneously promoting the production of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Conversely, the depletion of GSH or the loss of its de novo synthesis under chronic stress conditions compromises vital metabolic pathways regulated by mTOR, NFAT, and N-Myc, ultimately leading to the termination of T-cell activation as shown in Figure 3 55 6.3. Glutathione’s Role in Mycobacteria Infection Addressing the reduction in GSH in infections, one study highlighted its effects on M. tuberculosis M. tuberculosis 56 M. tuberculosis M. marinum M. leprae M. avium M. leprae M. marinum 57 58 7. Current Treatments 7.1. Treatment of M. leprae The treatment of leprosy caused by M. leprae 59 60 Treatment duration is guided by bacillary burden. Paucibacillary leprosy requires 6 months of dapsone and rifampicin, while multibacillary disease is treated for 12 months with all three drugs. Clinical monitoring is needed due to the potential for medication toxicity and immune reactions such as erythema nodosum leprosum. Despite the chronic nature of leprosy infection, it is curable with prompt and consistent treatment, and multi-drug therapy has dramatically reduced the global disease burden [ 61 62 Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immunological complication that affects many patients with lepromatous leprosy. It presents as painful nodular skin lesions and can also involve nerves, joints, and other organs. ENL may occur before, during, or after the completion of multidrug therapy. Managing this condition often requires prolonged corticosteroid treatment, which can lead to serious side effects and poses challenges, especially in resource-limited settings. Timely recognition of ENL is crucial to prevent permanent nerve damage and disability, and it is essential for patients to comply with treatment for successful outcomes [ 63 Adherence to prolonged therapy can be challenging, especially in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. To enhance compliance, the WHO provides free multidrug therapy in endemic countries. Although resistance to dapsone or rifampicin is rare, it can occur with incomplete or interrupted treatment. HIV-positive patients may experience altered immune responses, potentially affecting the progression of the disease and the management of leprosy reactions. Ultimately, the success of treatment depends on patient education, adherence to the treatment plan, and the early recognition of inflammatory complications [ 58 59 7.2. Treatment of M. marinum In contrast, management of M. marinum 62 64 Treatment duration typically extends for 1 to 2 months beyond clinical resolution, often totaling 3 to 6 months. For deeper and more invasive infections, surgical debridement may be necessary in addition to antibiotic therapy. It is crucial to adhere closely to the prolonged therapy regimens, as premature discontinuation can lead to relapse or treatment failure. Resistance to tetracyclines has been reported which suggests caution when using doxycycline or minocycline as monotherapy. This highlights the potential value of susceptibility testing to guide therapy. Patients with immunocompromising conditions, such as HIV infection or those using immunosuppressive medications, may require longer courses of treatment and closer monitoring due to an increased risk of disease dissemination. Additionally, drug tolerability and potential adverse effects should be taken into account. For example, ethambutol can cause optic neuropathy while macrolides can cause gastrointestinal upset. Early recognition of infections is crucial to prevent progression to deeper tissue involvement and to allow for the timely initiation of therapy [ 64 65 8.

At physiological levels, ROS promote immune activation and bacterial killing. Excessive ROS production, however, suppresses adaptive immunity and contributes to tissue damage and chronic infection. Figure 3 Illustrates the signaling pathway involved in TCR engagement leading to increased synthesis of GSH. It highlights how GSH synthesis suppression of Th17 cells and promotion of Tregs occurs, alongside a reduction in ROS. Subsequently, T cell proliferation and survival are stimulated, while the depletion of GSH results in the termination of T cell activation. ",
