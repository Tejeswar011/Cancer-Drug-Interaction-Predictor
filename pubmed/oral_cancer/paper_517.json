In this study, data from the FAERS from January 2020 to December 2022 were used to investigate signals associated with five monoclonal antibody products (bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab/etesevimab, bebtelovimab, casirivimab/imdevimab, sotrovimab) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and one monoclonal antibody product (tixagevimab/cilgavimab) in patients wherein COVID-19 vaccination was not recommended. Disproportionality analyses were conducted using the reporting odds ratio, and an information component to identify safety signals. There were 17,937,860 drug AE reports associated with all drugs in the FAERS documented during research period. Among them, 42,642 were AE reports associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies. The SOCs including respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal, and vascular disorders were frequently reported for all the six products. The three most commonly detected IMEs were hypoxia, COVID-19 pneumonia, and anaphylactic reaction due to SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Even though the purposes of use were different, the types of signals between drugs were similar. Careful monitoring of these AEs should be considered for certain COVID-19 patients, at risk, when they are treated with monoclonal antibody products.
