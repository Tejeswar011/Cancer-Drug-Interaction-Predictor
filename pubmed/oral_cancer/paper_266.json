Furthermore, BCL‐2 inhibitor regulated the number, function, and activation status of T cells, thereby enhancing T cell‐mediated antitumor immune responses.

Research has shown that BCL‐2 is aberrantly overexpressed in AML cells, which is closely related to poor prognosis in patients [ 4 5 The survival and apoptosis of immune cells and the abnormal expression of immune regulatory factors in the tumor immune microenvironment play critical roles in AML pathogenesis [ 6 7 At present, researchers have predominantly focused on the efficacy, recurrence rate, and resistance problems after VEN treatment, but there are few reports about how it affects the number and function of immune cells in AML patients. In theory, targeted drugs such as BCL‐2 inhibitor may affect lymphocyte function, thereby hindering normal antitumor immune responses and limiting the efficacy of subsequent immunotherapy [ 8 9 10 In this study, we first confirmed whether VEN has pro‐apoptotic effects on AML cells and affects the lymphocyte proportion and the cytokine levels in the immune microenvironment of AML. Then we explored the effects of VEN on the T cell number, function, activation status, and antitumor immune response, and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Our study indicated that VEN could influence the tumor immune microenvironment of AML patients and regulate T cells number and function to enhance T cell‐mediated antitumor immune responses, providing a new perspective that molecular‐targeted drugs can promote tumor cell death in the tumor immune microenvironment through a unique immune‐dependent mechanism. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Patient Samples According to the 2022 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AML in adults, the VEN + HMA regimen is the preferred first‐line induction therapy for patients deemed ineligible for intensive chemotherapy [ 2 2.2 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ( PBMC We used density gradient centrifugation with Lymphoprep (Tianjin Hao Yang Hua Ke Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Tianjin, China, LTS10771) to isolate PBMC from newly diagnosed AML patients and healthy donors. The PBMC was washed twice using aseptic phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS, ThermoFisher Scientific, China, 70011044) and resuspended to 5 × 6 2.3  AML Human AML cell lines THP‐1 and HL‐60 were purchased from Pricella Co. Ltd. (Wuhan, China). AML cells were cultured in RPMI‐1640 medium (Tianjin Hao Yang Hua Ke Biotechnology Co. Ltd. China, HY1640) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ABW, Germany, AB‐FBS‐0060S), 2 mM L‐glutamine (Merck Life Sciences Co. Ltd. Shanghai, China, G7513), and 10,000 U/mL streptomycin–penicillin (Merck Life Sciences Co. Ltd. Shanghai, China, P4333). Cells were cultured in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 × 6 2.4 Animals NCG mice were purchased from GemPharmatech Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China) and bred in the specific‐pathogen‐free (SPF) animal facility. All mice used for experiments were aged 3 to 5 weeks. All animal studies were performed according to guidelines for the use and care of live animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Lanzhou University Second Hospital. We constructed two AML xenograft mouse models. In the first model, a total of 20 NCG mice were randomly divided into four groups ( n 7 n 6 6 2.5 T Cells Sorting, Stimulation, Expansion, and Cocultivation CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were isolated using EasySep Human CD4 Positive Selection Kit II (StemCell, Canada, 18,052) and EasySep Human CD8 Positive Selection Kit II (StemCell, Canada, 18,053), and the specific experimental methods were as follows. Firstly, the 1 × 10 7 2.6  CCK The cytotoxicity of VEN on AML cells and T cells was assessed by CCK‐8 assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96‐well plates at a density of 5.0 × 10 4 2.7 Calcein AM PI Calcein‐AM/PI staining assays were used to assess apoptosis in AML cells and T cells. After 24‐h incubation with different concentrations of VEN, cells were immediately stained with calcein‐AM (4 μmol/L) and PI (6 μmol/L) for 30 min (Biosharp, Beijing, China, BL130B). The photographs were captured by an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX53, Japan). Viable cells exhibited green fluorescence (calcein‐AM), whereas apoptotic cells showed red fluorescence (PI). 2.8 Flow Cytometry Analysis 2.8.1 Lymphocyte Subsets Peripheral blood (2 mL, EDTA‐K2 anticoagulated) was collected from AML patients. We added separately 20 μL of CD45/CD3/CD4/CD8 (BD Bioscience, USA, 340491) or CD45/CD3/CD16 + CD56/CD19 (BD Bioscience, USA, 340500) or CD4/CD25/FOXP3 (BD Bioscience, USA, 560131) multitest antibodies into the bottom of different flow tubes. Then, we added 200 μL of blood specimen into the flow tube. The tubes were shaken gently and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Next, we added 1× hemolysin (BD Bioscience, USA, 349202) to the tube, mixed gently by shaking, and then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Finally, we centrifuged all the tubes, discarded the supernatant, added PBS into the flow tube, mixed gently by shaking, and analyzed by flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, USA). Regarding animal experiments, T cell subsets were analyzed from peripheral blood. PBMC‐humanized AML mouse models. We added 20 μL of CD45/CD3/CD4/CD8 (BD Bioscience, USA, 662965) multitest antibodies into the bottom of the flow tube. Then, we added 200 μL blood specimen (EDTA‐K2 anticoagulated) into the flow tube, shook gently, and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Subsequent processing steps were performed identically to those established for human clinical specimens. 2.8.2 T Cell Purity CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells were resuspended in 1 mL PBS at a density of 1 × 10 6 2.8.3 Cell Apoptosis Cell apoptosis was analyzed using an Annexin V‐APC/7‐AAD Apoptosis Kit (Multi Sciences, Hangzhou, China, AP105). After incubation for 24 h with different concentrations of VEN, AML cells or T cells (1 × 10 6 2.8.4 PD‐1 After 24‐h treatment with VEN at indicated concentrations, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (1 × 10 6 2.8.5 T Cell Activation Markers After 24‐h treatment with VEN at indicated concentrations, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (1 × 10 6 2.8.6  CD4 CD8 After 24‐h treatment with VEN at indicated concentrations, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (1 × 10 6 2.8.7  CD45 CD34 Peripheral blood (100 μL, EDTA‐K2 anticoagulated) was collected from the PBMC‐humanized AML mice. CD45 antibody (BD Bioscience, New Jersey, USA, 340943) and CD34 antibody (BD Bioscience, New Jersey, USA, 400381) were added to the blood. Then the cells were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Next, we added 1× hemolysin (BD Bioscience, USA, 349202) to the tube and then incubated the cells at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. We centrifuged all the tubes and discarded the supernatant. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 200 μL PBS, and analyzed immediately using flow cytometry (BECKMAN CytoFLEX, USA). 2.9 Cytometric Bead Array We collected 2 mL fasting peripheral blood (EDTA‐K2 anticoagulated) from the newly diagnosed AML patients, peripheral blood 0.4 mL (EDTA‐K2 anticoagulated) from the PBMC‐humanized AML mice models, and the CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells 1 mL (1 × 10 6 2.10 Enzyme‐Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ELISA kits (Shanghai Enzyme Linked Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China, ml063483 and ml060098) of Perforin and Granzyme B were used to assess the production of Perforin and Granzyme B. CD8+ T cells or peripheral blood from PBMC‐humanized AML mouse models were centrifuged to obtain culture supernatant or serum, and then loaded into a 96‐well plate. Antibodies, enzymes, and culture supernatant or mouse serum were sequentially added to sample wells and incubated according to the manufacturer's instructions. After terminating the reaction by adding the stop solution, the OD value at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). 2.11 Western Blot ( WB After 24‐h treatment with different concentrations of VEN, we detected changes in the expression of apoptosis‐related proteins in AML cells and T cells. Total proteins were extracted by the RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Naitong, China, P0013B) containing the protease inhibitors (Roche, USA, 04693132001). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bio‐Rad protein assay (Bio‐Rad, Basel, Switzerland, 23,227). Then, we separated proteins using SDS‐PAGE gels and transferred them onto PVDF membranes (GE, USA, 10600023). Membranes were blocked with QuickBlock Blocking Buffer (Beyotime, Naitong, China, P0252), followed by incubation overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies of BCL‐2, BCL‐xl, MCL‐1, BAX, cleaved‐caspase3, cleaved‐caspase7, ALDOA, HK2, PFKP, PKM2, GAPDH, and β‐tubulin (Wuhan Sanying Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China). After being washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with the species‐matched secondary antibodies (anti‐rabbit or anti‐mouse) (Beyotime, Naitong, China, A0208 and A0216). Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Beyotime, Naitong, China, P0018S). 2.12 Data Independent Acquisition ( DIA Total protein was extracted from CON and VEN groups of T cells. DIA proteomics experiment was performed by Baipu Biology (Shanghai, China). This study used t‐test combined with fold change (FC) to analyze and screen the significant differential proteins.

Formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded specimens were treated with paraffin, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections in EDTA‐based buffer under high‐pressure heating for 10 min. Blocked with 3% H 2 2 2.15 Pyruvic Acid Measurements Pyruvic acid levels were measured using a pyruvic acid Content Detection Kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China, bc 2.16 Statistical Analysis All experiments were independently repeated three times. GraphPad Prism 9.0 and SPSS 26.0 were used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables were analyzed using Student's t‐test or one‐way ANOVA, whereas survival curves were generated via Kaplan–Meier analysis with between‐group differences assessed by log‐rank test. p 3 Results 3.1  VEN AML To investigate the effect of VEN on the AML tumor immune microenvironment, we first validated its cytotoxic effects on AML cells, establishing a foundation for subsequent experiments. Clinical data of newly diagnosed AML patients receiving VEN + HMA treatment were collected; the patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 1A 1B 1C 1C 1D TABLE 1 Clinical characteristics of AML patients.

Compared to the HMA monotherapy group, the proportion of primitive cells and MRD level in bone marrow were significantly decreased, the RBC count, HGB level, and PLT count were significantly increased, and the WBC count had no significant changes in the VEN + HMA group after treatment (B). The newly diagnosed AML patients receiving more than three cycles of VEN + HMA treatment had a better PFS than those receiving less than three cycles, and the newly diagnosed AML patients receiving VEN + HMA treatment had a better PFS than those receiving HMA monotherapy (C). The CCK‐8 assay detected the IC50 values of VEN monotherapy on PBMC from newly diagnosed AML patients at 24, 48, and 72 h. The results showed that AML cells from different AML patients had different sensitivities to VEN but overall exhibited time‐concentration‐dependent cytotoxicity (D). * p p p p Subsequently, we performed in vitro and animal experiments. We selected two AML cell lines, THP‐1 and HL‐60, and measured the IC50 values of VEN on THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells at 24, 48, and 72 h. VEN effectively promoted THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells apoptosis in vitro in a time‐ and dose‐dependent manner, with statistically significant differences(Figure 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F FIGURE 2 We tested the IC50 values of VEN monotherapy on THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells at 24, 48, and 72 h. The results showed that VEN could significantly promote THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells apoptosis in a time‐concentration‐dependent manner; THP‐1 cells were the most significant (A). The calcein‐AM/PI staining assay showed a significant decrease in viable cells (calcein) and a significant increase in apoptotic cells (PI) of THP‐1 cells after different concentrations of VEN treatment (B). The calcein‐AM/PI staining assay showed a significant decrease in viable cells (calcein) and a significant increase in apoptotic cells (PI) of HL‐60 cells (20×) after different concentrations of VEN treatment (C). The apoptosis rate of THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells after different concentrations of VEN treatment was measured, and the results showed that VEN could significantly promote THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells apoptosis in a concentration‐dependent manner (D). In the subcutaneous tumor model, the volume of subcutaneous tumors in the VEN group was significantly reduced compared to the control group (E). In the tail vein model, the proportion of CD45+ cells and CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood was significantly reduced in the VEN group compared to the control group (F). BCL‐2 expression in THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells after different concentrations of VEN treatment had no significant difference; the expression of BCL‐xl, MCL‐1, BAX, cleaved‐caspase3, and cleaved‐caspase7 increased in a concentration‐dependent increased (G). * p p p p Finally, we performed WB experiments to evaluate the effect of VEN on the apoptosis of AML cells. It was found that there was no obvious difference in the expression of antiapoptotic BCL‐2 family BCL‐2 protein after VEN treatment, but the expression of BCL‐xl and MCL‐1 increased in a concentration‐dependent manner, which was consistent with the results in previous literature (Figure 2G 2G 3.2  VEN AML After confirming that VEN could effectively promote AML cell apoptosis, we explored its effect on the AML immune microenvironment. Immune cells and cytokines are the key components of the immune microenvironment. Then, we investigated the impact of VEN on both immune cells and cytokine levels. We examined changes in the proportions of lymphocyte subsets following the first cycle of VEN + HMA treatment in newly diagnosed AML patients. The results demonstrated that after VEN + HMA treatment, the proportions of total T cells (significantly increased), CD4+ T cells (slightly increased), CD8+ T cells (significantly increased), and natural killer (NK) cells (significantly increased) were altered, while Treg cells showed a slight decrease and B cells exhibited a significant decrease (Figure 3A FIGURE 3 The proportion of total T cells was significantly increased, the proportion of CD4+ T cells was slightly increased, the proportion of CD8+ T cells was significantly increased, the proportion of Treg cells was slightly decreased, the proportion of NK cells was significantly increased, and the proportion of B cells was significantly decreased after VEN + HMA treatment (A). Compared with HMA monotherapy, the proportion of total T cells and CD4+ T cells in AML patients was significantly increased after VEN + HMA treatment, while the proportion of B cells was significantly decreased (B). IFN‐γ level was significantly increased and IL‐17 level was mildly decreased in the peripheral blood of newly diagnosed AML patients after VEN + HMA treatment (C). The newly diagnosed AML patients who received VEN + HMA treatment had higher IL‐5 and IFN‐γ levels in the peripheral blood of newly diagnosed AML patients compared to HMA monotherapy treatment (D). * p p To further clarify VEN's role, we analyzed the proportion differences of lymphocyte subsets between VEN + HMA treatment and HMA monotherapy in newly diagnosed AML patients. Compared to HMA monotherapy, VEN + HMA treatment significantly increased the proportions of total T cells and CD4+ T cells but significantly decreased B cell proportions (Figure 3B Cytokines are key mediators of immune system regulation, modulating antitumor immune responses and directly inducing tumor cell death. Changes in cytokine levels after VEN treatment can also reflect their effects on the immune microenvironment. We analyzed the changes in common 12 cytokine levels in peripheral blood after the first cycle of VEN + HMA treatment and found that interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ) level was significantly increased (Figure 3C 3C 3D 3.3  VEN This study confirmed that VEN effectively promoted AML cell apoptosis and modulated the AML immune microenvironment. T cells exhibited the most pronounced changes in lymphocyte subsets after VEN treatment. Therefore, we focused on T cells, which can recognize and directly kill tumor cells as our primary research object. We investigated the effect of VEN on T cells number in the AML immune microenvironment. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were isolated from newly diagnosed AML patients using the EasySep Cell Isolation & Cell Separation Technology and cultured for subsequent experiments. AML cell lines and CD4/CD8+ T cells were treated with VEN at equivalent concentrations for 24 h. The CCK‐8 assay was used to assess the differential cytotoxic effects of VEN at equivalent concentrations on AML cells versus CD4/CD8+ T cells. VEN treatment significantly increased the apoptosis rates of THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells, whereas CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed no significant changes (Figure 4A 4B 4C 4D 4E FIGURE 4 VEN treatment with the same concentration could promote AML cells significant apoptosis, but could not influence the number of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells (A). The calcein‐AM/PI staining showed that there were no changes in viable cells (calcein) and apoptotic cells (PI) of CD4+ T cells (20×) after different concentrations of VEN treatment (B). The calcein‐AM/PI staining showed that there were no changes in viable cells (calcein) and apoptotic cells (PI) of CD8+ T cells after different concentrations of VEN treatment (C). The apoptosis rate of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells after different concentrations of VEN treatment was measured, and the results showed that VEN could not promote CD4+ T (D) and CD8+ T cells apoptosis (E). In the PBMC‐humanized AML mouse model, the proportions of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood were significantly higher in the VEN group than in the control group (F). After VEN treatment, the expression of BAX was decreased in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, while the expression of cleaved‐caspase3 and cleaved‐caspase7 had no significant difference. There was no significant difference in the expression of BCL‐2 and BCL‐xl in CD4+ T cells, but the expression of MCL‐1 showed a concentration‐dependent increase. There was no significant difference in the expression of BCL‐2 in CD8+ T cells, but the expression of BCL‐xl and MCL‐1 showed a concentration‐dependent increase (G). The CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells showed a higher expression level of BAX, cleaved‐caspase3, cleaved‐caspase7, BCL‐xl, and MCL‐1, and a lower expression of BCL‐2 compared to THP‐1 and HL‐60 cells (H). * p Subsequently, we conducted animal experiments using PBMC‐humanized AML mouse models. We examined the difference in the proportion of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. The results showed that the proportion of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the VEN group was significantly higher compared to those in the control group (Figure 4F Next, in order to confirm that T cells had apoptotic resistance to VEN at the molecular level, we analyzed the changes in apoptosis‐related proteins and downstream components of the caspase signaling pathway in T cells after 24‐h VEN treatment. VEN treatment induced a concentration‐dependent decrease in BAX expression, with no significant changes in cleaved‐caspase3 or cleaved‐caspase7 levels (Figure 4G 4G Finally, we further explored why VEN at the same concentration could effectively promote AML cells apoptosis but did not induce a significant decrease in T cells number. We compared the protein expression differences of BCL‐2, BCL‐xl, MCL‐1, BAX, cleaved‐caspase3, and cleaved‐caspase7 between AML cells and T cells. The results revealed that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibited higher baseline expression of BAX, cleaved‐caspase3, and cleaved‐caspase7 than AML cells (Figure 4H 4H 3.4  VEN Cytokines are synthesized and secreted by immune cells and some nonimmune cells, with T cells playing an important role in secretion of cytokines [ 11 5A 5A FIGURE 5 The secretion of IL‐10 by CD4+ T cells was significantly decreased, and the secretion of TNF‐α by CD8+ T cells was significantly increased. The secretion of IL‐10 by CD8+ T cells was decreased, the secretion of IFN‐γ by CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells was increased, and the secretion of IL‐17 by CD4+ T cells was decreased (A). In the peripheral blood for PBMC humanized AML mice, the IL‐1β and IFN‐γ levels were significantly increased, and IL‐6 levels were significantly decreased in the VEN group compared to the control group (B). The secretion of Perforin and Granzyme B by CD8+ T cells was significantly increased in a concentration‐dependent manner after VEN treatment. In the PBMC humanized AML mouse model, the VEN group mice had higher levels of Perforin and Granzyme B compared to the control group, especially Perforin (C). The expression of PD‐1 in CD4+ T cells (D) and CD8+ T cells (E) were significantly increased in a concentration‐dependent manner after VEN treatment. In the PBMC humanized AML mouse model, it was found that the expression of PD‐1 in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was significantly increased in the VEN group compared to the control group (F).* p p Finally, we tested the effect of VEN on the cytokine expression in the PBMC‐humanized AML mouse models and found that IL‐1β and IFN‐γ levels were significantly increased, while IL‐6 levels were significantly decreased in the VEN group compared with that in the control group (Figure 5B 5B 3.5  VEN Perforin and Granzyme B are cytotoxic proteins that selectively activate caspase proteins, inducing tumor cell death [ 12 5C 5C 3.6  VEN PD The interaction between PD‐1 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) suppresses T cell proliferation and activation, thereby promoting tumor immune escape [ 13 5D 5E 5F 3.7  VEN We found that VEN may enhance T cell‐mediated cytotoxicity, and T cell activation status is crucial for T cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Therefore, we tested whether VEN could directly activate T cells. We treated CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells with VEN in vitro, and then detected the expression of T cell activation markers (CD25, CD38, and CD69) by flow cytometry. The results revealed that VEN promoted T cell activation, which was mainly manifested as an increase in T cell activation markers CD25 and CD38, but no significant difference was observed in the CD69 expression (Figure 6A–C FIGURE 6 The proportion of CD4+ CD25+ T cells and CD8+ CD25+ T cells was significantly increased after VEN treatment (A), while there was no significant change in the proportion of CD4+ CD69+ T cells and CD8+ CD69+ T cells after VEN treatment (B). The proportion of CD4+ CD38+ T cells was significantly increased, while the proportion of CD8+ CD38 + T cells was slightly increased after VEN treatment (C). The proportion of CD4+ memory T cells (CD4+ CD45RO+) was significantly increased, while the proportion of CD4+ naive T cells (CD4+ CD45RA+) was significantly decreased after VEN treatment (D). The proportion of CD8+ memory T cells (CD8+ CD45RO+) was significantly increased, while the proportion of CD8+ naive T cells (CD8+ CD45RA+) was significantly decreased after VEN treatment (E). * p 3.8  VEN CD4 CD8 Finally, this study investigated the potential effects of VEN on CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cell subsets in vitro by flow cytometry. We found that naive T cells were the most sensitive subset of T cells. After VEN treatment, the proportion of CD4+ memory T cells (CD4+ CD45RO+) was significantly increased, while the proportion of CD4+ naive T cells (CD4+ CD45RA+) was significantly decreased (Figure 6D 6E 3.9  VEN We found that VEN enhanced T cell activation and increased secretion of cytotoxic effector molecules, including IFN‐γ, perforin, and granzyme B, suggesting VEN might enhance T cell‐mediated antitumor immune responses. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated whether VEN augmented T cell‐mediated killing of AML cells using in vitro and in vivo experiments. For in vitro experiments, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were treated with VEN for 24 h. Following treatment, the culture supernatant was removed, and T cells were washed twice with PBS to eliminate residual VEN. These pretreated T cells were then co‐cultured with THP‐1 cells. CCK‐8 assays revealed that VEN significantly enhanced T cell‐mediated killing of THP‐1 cells (Figure 7A 7B,C 7D,E FIGURE 7 This study cocultured THP‐1 cells with CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells which were treated by VEN in advance by Transwell chamber. The viability of THP‐1 cells after co‐culture with CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells which were treated by VEN was significantly decreased in a concentration‐dependent manner, and VEN could enhance the killing effect of T cells on AML cells (A). Calcein‐AM/PI staining found that apoptosis of THP‐1 cells (20×) after co‐culture with CD4+ T cells treated by VEN was more significant, showing a decrease in viable cells (calcein) and an increase in apoptotic cells (PI) (B). Calcein‐AM/PI staining found that apoptosis of THP‐1 cells (20×) after co‐culture with CD8+ T cells treated by VEN was more significant, showing a decrease in viable cells (calcein) and an increase in apoptotic cells (PI) (C). The apoptosis rate of THP‐1 cells after co‐culture with CD4+ T cells treated by VEN was significantly increased in a concentration‐dependent manner (D). A similar conclusion was obtained for CD8+ T cells that CD8+ T treated by VEN could promote THP‐1 cell apoptosis in a concentration‐dependent manner (E). In the AML mouse model constructed by tail vein injection of THP‐1, the proportion of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood was lowest in the PBMC+VEN group, followed by the VEN group, the third lowest in the PBMC group, and the highest in the blank control group, the difference was statistically significant (F). In the AML subcutaneous tumor model, the volume of subcutaneous tumor was smallest in the PBMC+VEN group, followed by the VEN group, the third smallest in the PBMC group, and the largest in the blank control group (G). Subsequently, the mice were euthanized and subcutaneous tumors were dissected. The same conclusion was drawn by comparing the volumes of subcutaneous tumors in the four groups (H).* p p p p To validate these findings in vivo, we established two AML mouse models. In the AML mouse model constructed by tail vein injection of THP‐1 cells, the proportion of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood was significantly lower in the PBMC + VEN group compared to PBMC‐alone, VEN‐alone, and blank control groups (Figure 7F 7G 7H 3.10  VEN Our study demonstrated that VEN could enhance T cell‐mediated antitumor immune responses, though the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Therefore, this study performed DIA proteomics to analyze the effect of VEN treatment on the T cell protein profile. There were 355 proteins of T cells showing significant changes after VEN treatment, with 207 significantly upregulated and 148 downregulated (Figure 8A 8B 8C 8D‐a FIGURE 8 Bar chart of differential protein count (A) and Volcano plot of differential protein (B) of T cells after VEN treatment (Group A was VEN group, and Group B was CON group). Data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics found that the metabolism pathways of T cells were abnormally activated after VEN treatment (C) and the ALDOA protein in T cells was significantly increased after VEN treatment (D‐a). The qRT‐PCR experiment revealed a significantly increased level of ALDOA p p p p Given ALDOA's role in glycolysis, we hypothesized that VEN may regulate T cells' glycolysis to regulate T cells' number, function, and antitumor immunity. To validate this, we first assessed ALDOA ALDOA 8D‐b 8D‐c 8E To further investigate glycolytic reprogramming, we analyzed the effect of VEN treatment on the key protein expression in the glycolysis pathway. The results showed that the expression of key enzymes, including HK2, PFKP, and PKM2 proteins, was increased (Figure 8F 8G 4 Discussion BCL‐2, a key regulator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, is often overexpressed in AML cells, making it a promising therapeutic target [ 14 15 Tumor cells and immune cells coexist in the AML tumor microenvironment, but it is unclear how VEN influences the immune microenvironment while promoting tumor cell apoptosis. Immune cells and cytokines are critical components of the immune microenvironment. This research found that VEN treatment can regulate lymphocyte proportion and affect cytokine levels in the AML tumor immune microenvironment. Thus, VEN could regulate the immune microenvironment of AML patients. NK cells are cytotoxic innate lymphocytes capable of eliminating tumor cells. This study demonstrates that VEN elevates NK cell levels in AML patients, potentially augmenting NK cell‐mediated antileukemic immunity. However, this research primarily focuses on T cells and has not yet comprehensively investigated the effects of VEN on NK cell functionality and antileukemia immune responses. Subsequent phases of our research will systematically examine these mechanisms using integrated in vivo and in vitro experimental models. T cells are the primary mediators of antitumor immunity. Historically, researchers generally thought that CD8+ T cells were important effector cells for antitumor immunity, but preclinical and clinical studies have shown that CD4+ T cells also exhibit cytotoxic effects and can directly kill tumor cells [ 16 In theory, targeted drugs such as VEN may affect lymphocyte function, thereby hindering normal antitumor immune responses and limiting the efficacy of immunotherapy [ 8 17 18 Cytokines are pivotal regulators of immune function. Interleukin (IL) plays crucial roles in activating and regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Elevated levels of IL‐17, IL‐6, and IL‐10 in AML patients may contribute to an immunosuppressive role [ 19 20 21 12 PD‐1 is an important immunosuppressive molecule and can inhibit T cell activation and cytokine secretion to promote tumor immune escape [ 13 9 22 23 24 Numerous complex regulatory mechanisms influence T cell function, and T cell activation status is one of the key factors. Activated T cells play an important role in the antitumor immune response [ 25 26 27 28 The activation markers and antitumor immune effector molecules in T cells were increased after VEN treatment, possibly because VEN could impact T lymphocyte subsets. Therefore, we analyzed alterations in T lymphocyte subsets after VEN treatment. We found that the proportion of CD4+ memory T cells and CD8+ memory T cells was significantly increased, while the proportion of CD4+ naive T cells and CD8+ naive T cells was significantly decreased after VEN treatment. Naive T cells exhibited higher sensitivity to VEN treatment. We found that VEN treatment improved the AML tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and enhanced T cell‐mediated antitumor immune response. Subsequently, we validated the above results through an in vitro co‐culture model and PBMC‐humanized AML mouse model. The results showed that T cells treated with VEN had a stronger killing effect on AML cells. Our research confirmed that VEN may directly enhance T cell‐mediated antitumor immune response by influencing activation, differentiation, and secretion function of T cells. To investigate the mechanism underlying VEN‐mediated regulation of T cell function, we performed DIA proteomics and identified enhanced metabolic pathway signaling, particularly glucose metabolism. ALDOA is a key molecule in glycolysis, and its expression was significantly increased after VEN treatment, suggesting that VEN may regulate T cell function by affecting glycolysis. In addition, VEN upregulated the expression level of key enzymes and final production in glycolysis. The above experiments all demonstrated that VEN enhanced the glycolysis of T lymphocytes. Glycolysis is the main pathway for glucose metabolism in effector T cells. The rapid transition of T cell metabolism to glycolysis could promote the activation of memory T cells and make them become effector T cells, promoting effector cytokine secretion such as Granzyme B and IFN‐γ [ 29 30 Genomic alterations, including gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities, play a critical role in AML biology and treatment response, suggesting that divergent genetic profiles may confound experimental outcomes [ 31 In summary, this study found that BCL‐2 inhibitors can effectively induce AML cell apoptosis, regulate the proportion of lymphocytes, and affect the cytokine levels in the AML tumor immune microenvironment (Figure 9 9 FIGURE 9 The graphical abstract of this study. This study found that BCL‐2 inhibitor can effectively induce AML cells apoptosis, regulate the proportion of lymphocytes to affect the AML tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, BCL‐2 inhibitor regulated the number, function, and activation status of T cells, thereby enhancing T cell‐mediated antitumor immune responses. This effect may be attributed to the ability of BCL‐2 inhibitor to promote glycolysis in T cells.
