These growths are intricately linked to the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis, posing unique challenges in diagnosis and management. Oral neurofibromas typically manifest as slow-growing, painless nodules or masses within the oral cavity. Common sites include the tongue, gingiva, and the buccal mucosa. While these tumors are generally benign, they can cause discomfort, interfere with oral functions, and, in some cases, lead to bleeding or ulceration. Diagnosing oral neurofibromas involves a combination of clinical examination, medical history review, and, in some cases, imaging studies. This case report discusses the histological, immunohistochemical, and surgical characteristics of oral neurofibroma to raise knowledge and comprehension of these diseases.

Peripheral nerves are composed of bundles of nerve fibers, including both sensory and motor neurons. There can be various disorders that can arise from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) such that it can manifest as reactive lesions and benign and malignant conditions. 1 3 Seldom occurring soft tissue neoplasms are oral and maxillofacial tumors of neural origin. One such lesion is neurofibroma (NF), an uncommon type of tumor that originates from the cells of the peripheral nervous system, specifically the cells called Schwann cells, which produce the protective covering (myelin) around nerve fibers. They account for 29% of the neural lesions in the oral cavity and can present as a solitary lesion or as a component of the generalized neurofibromatosis syndrome, which is typically neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF-1], commonly known as von Recklinghausen disease of the skin. 4 5 Clinically, oral neurofibromas typically manifest as slow-growing sessile or pedunculated nodules. The tongue, buccal mucosa, alveolar ridge, labial mucosa, palate, gingiva, and alveolar ridge are common locations for solitary oral NF. 5 6 7 C ase resentation A healthy 17-year-old male patient reported with a complaint of a growth in the left buccal mucosa that had existed for 5 years. There was no association with pain or any habits. Intraoral examination revealed evidence of a sessile growth on the left buccal mucosa of size 0.5 × 0.5 cm ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1: A solitary swelling of size 0.5 × 0.5 cm is evident on the left buccal mucosa I nvestigations An incisional biopsy was planned under local anesthesia. 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline was administered at the surgical site through local infiltration. The lesion was excised in toto Macroscopically, the excised specimen appeared as an oval, well-defined soft tissue mass measuring 0.7 × 0.5 cm, grayish-brown in color, and was soft to firm in consistency. Formalin-fixed histopathological tissues of the excisional biopsy revealed a circumscribed lesion that was nonencapsulated with an overlying stratified squamous epithelium ( Fig. 2A Figs 2B D Figs 2A to D: (A and B) (H&E 2× and 4×) Photomicrograph shows a nonencapsulated lesion in the connective tissue with an overlying stratified squamous epithelium; (C) (H&E 10×) Photomicrograph shows a cellular stroma interspersed with nerve fibers; (D) (H&E 40×) Photomicrograph shows cells that are elongated and spindle-shaped with wavy nuclei D ifferential iagnosis Most important differentials that can be considered are schwannoma. The tumor proliferation involving merely only the Schwann cells leads to schwannoma, whereas the entire nerve fibers inside the fascicles undergo tumor proliferation, leading to neurofibroma. Table 1 Table 1: Differential diagnosis to consider for neurofibroma  Differentials  Clinical features  Why to consider it as differential diagnosis  Histopathologic features Schwannoma 8 Encapsulated, slow growth; most common in the 3rd–4th decade Neural origin Biphasic: Cellular regions (Antoni A) with nuclear palisading (Verocay bodies) and a hypocellular component (Antoni B) Palisaded encapsulated neuroma 9 Lobulated or nodular growth, encapsulated; common site is the hard palate; occurs in the 5th–7th decade Neural origin Fascicular proliferation of spindle cells with a moderate cell density and some places displaying parallel nuclei Nerve sheath myxoma 10 Solitary, slow growth; common in the gingiva followed by the buccal mucosa and tongue Neural origin Lobulated, nonencapsulated, well-circumscribed lesions with a proliferating myxoid stroma containing spindle, stellate, and occasionally epithelioid-shaped cells. Traumatic neuromas 11 Common in younger age-groups; nodular growth with smooth surface Neural origin Nonencapsulated, plenty of randomly distributed nerve fascicles inside a stroma that is fibroblastic and collagenous Granular cell tumors 12 Nodular growth; common in the tongue Neural origin Not circumscribed; stroma with large, polygonal cells arranged in sheets or clusters with granular cytoplasm associated with pseudo epitheliomatous hyperplasia Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) 13 2nd–5th decade; circumscribed submucosal mass, rapid growth; common in the mandible, lips, buccal mucosa; painful Neural origin Sheets of cells in patterns of fasciculation displaying four or more mitotic figures with a high-power field Lipoma 14 Submucosal nodules that are mobile, painless, have a yellowish hue, slow growth, and are common in the buccal mucosa, lips, and tongue Deep-seated lipoma-like spindle cell lipoma can resemble neural origin Composed of mature adipocytes; uniform spindle cells can be seen in spindle cell lipoma Leiomyoma 15 Slow-growing, asymptomatic, solitary swelling, commonly in the lip, palate Spindle-shaped cells resembling neural origin Interlocking bundles and fascicles of smooth muscle cells that are stellate or spindle-shaped and have elongated, blunt-ended nuclei Pyogenic granuloma 16 Sessile or a pedunculated lesion, painless; commonly involving the gingiva, lip, tongue, buccal mucosa; 2nd–5th decade; female predilection Clinical resemblance Covered by stratified squamous epithelium and connective tissue stroma filled with numerous proliferating endothelial-lined blood capillaries and sparse collagen. Traumatic fibroma 17 Smooth, round nodule, painless; common in the buccal mucosa, lip, and tongue, associated with irritation/trauma history Clinical resemblance Nonencapsulated mass composed of fibrous connective tissue with collagen bundles interspersed with fibroblasts, blood vessels, and scattered chronic inflammatory cells with overlying epithelium T reatment Most of the nerve tumors are surgically well managed. Even large lesions can be managed surgically by simple surgical excision, and they seldom recur. However, the procedure carries a risk of potential damage to the underlying nerve as the lesion has to be carefully dissected from the nerve sheath. This can lead to a possible permanent or transient alteration in nerve function. D iscussion Structure of a nerve: Figure 3 Fig. 3: Illustration of the peripheral nerve anatomy with its associated lesions Pathology: 18 Clinically, this lesion is a rare lesion, and a total of 26 solitary cases only have been reported in English literature. The distribution pattern was seven cases (26.9%) involving the tongue, five cases (19.2%) in the gingiva and palate, followed by four cases (15.3%) in the floor of the mouth and lip. The rarest was one case (0.035) in the cheeks. Our case today reported is one of the rarest on the left buccal mucosa. The age predilection for these lesions is usually in the third decade of life, and surprisingly, our case is again a rare entity presenting in a 17-year-old male patient. The surgeon diagnosed it as an irritational/traumatic fibroma. The unraveling histopathological findings of bundles of nerve fascicles with spindle-shaped tumor cells with elongated nuclei encompassed in a myxoid stroma and covered by an overlying stratified squamous epithelium are a classic feature of neurofibroma. Neurofibromas are of two types, solitary or associated with syndromes. Usually, the common one is the latter one, which is seen in more than 72% of the cases. Neurofibromas of skin are more common than oral lesions. In oral lesions, they are usually associated with neurofibromatosis type I. Solitary neurofibromas being an extremely rare entity, it is extremely important to diagnose it at the earliest to avoid the other complications of a tumor that originates from a nerve. Most of the nerve tumors are surgically well managed. Even large lesions can be managed surgically by simple surgical excision and they seldom recur. However, the procedure carries a risk of potential damage to the underlying nerve as the lesion must be carefully dissected from the nerve sheath. This can lead to possible permanent or transient alteration in nerve function.
