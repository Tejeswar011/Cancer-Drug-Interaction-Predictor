Introduction Diabetes, as a lifelong, progressive chronic metabolic disorder [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Diabetes encompasses multiple forms, with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) being the most prevalent [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 α-Amylase (α-AMY) and α-glucosidase (α-GLU) are key digestive enzymes regulating blood sugar after meals. In the digestive process of the human body, salivary and pancreatic α-amylase collectively participate in the hydrolysis of starch from the oral cavity to the small intestine [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Porphyrins are macrocyclic compounds containing four pyrrole molecules ( Figure 1 Figure 1 2 Figure 1 In recent years, the use of metal complexes for the treatment of diabetes is a new treatment strategy [ 27 28 29 30 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 31 2 2 2 4 2 32 Therefore, this study selected three porphyrin compounds with different functional groups (TAPP, THPP, TCPP) and three metalloporphyrins incorporating different metal ions as central atoms (Cu–TCPP, Fe–TCPP, Ni–TCPP). A preliminary investigation was conducted on the interaction mechanisms between these six compounds and the enzymes α-amylase and α-glucosidase. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials TCPP, α-amylase, α-glucosidase, pNPG, and acarbose were purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Porphyrins and Gal-G2-α-CNP were purchased from Shanghai Maclean’s Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 2.2. Inhibitory Activity Assay 2.2.1. α-Amylase Inhibitory Activity Assay The inhibitory activity detection process was slightly modified, with reference [ 33 (1) inhibition  rate % = ( 1 − ( A 1 − A 2 ) / ( A 3 − A 4 ) ) × 100 In the formula, A 1 2 3 4 2.2.2. α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activity Assay The assay for α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was slightly modified according to the method in the reference [ 34 2 3 2.2.3. Calculation of IC 50 Using the enzyme inhibition rate as the y x 50 2.3. Mode of α-AMY and α-GLU Inhibition In the experiment, the concentration of the fixed substrate Gal-G2-α-CNP/pNPG solution was 5 mmol/L, and the concentrations of the two enzymes (100, 200, 300, 400 U/L) were used to determine the effect of different concentrations of porphyrins on enzyme activity. The concentration of the enzyme was 200 U/L, and the concentration of the substrate Gal-G2-α-CNP/pNPG solution (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 mmol/L) was used to determine the effect of different concentrations of porphyrins on the enzyme-catalyzed substrate activity. Upon identifying the type of inhibition, the kinetic equations vary for different inhibition types. For mixed-type inhibition, the kinetic equation is given by Formula (2); for non-competitive inhibition, it is described by Formula (3).

In Vitro Stability Studies Samples of a certain mass concentration were subjected to a water bath at different temperatures (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 °C) for 20 min and treated under different pH conditions (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0) for 20 min to determine the effect of temperature and pH on the stability of the two enzymes. 2.5. Fluorescence Quenching Method In the α-amylase experiment, a series of porphyrins and amylase (200 U/L) were mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1. In the α-glucosidase experiment, the glucosidase concentration was 400 U/L, mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1; the samples were maintained at three different temperatures (298, 304, and 310 K) for 30 min, with excitation at 280 nm and emission scanning from 300 to 500 nm. The Stern–Volmer equation [ 35 (6) F 0 F = 1 + K s v [ Q ] = 1 + K q τ 0 [ Q ] The Stern–Volmer equation was adapted based on experimental data to more accurately characterize the quenching behavior [ 36 (7) F 0 F = e K s v [ Q ] = e K q τ 0 [ Q ] In the formula, the fluorescence quenching ratio was calculated as F 0 /F F 0 F K SV K q 0 −8 Q Due to the presence of an internal filtration effect, a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the system may occur. Therefore, all fluorescence data were corrected using Formula (8) to eliminate the internal filtration effect [ 37 (8) F c o r = F o b s e ( A e x + A e m ) 2 In the formula, F cor obs A ex A em The evaluation of the interaction forces between porphyrin compounds and the two enzymes can be achieved by calculating thermodynamic parameters. When both ΔH 0 0 0 0 0 0 38 The thermodynamic parameters were calculated using Formulas (9) and (10), and then the Van’t Hoff plot for the interactions between the porphyrin compounds and the two enzymes was generated by plotting ln K a Y T X (9) ln K a = − Δ H 0 R T + Δ S 0 R (10) Δ G 0 = Δ H 0 − T Δ S 0 = − R T ln K a 2.6. Synchronous Fluorescence Spectroscopy Synchronous fluorescence spectra (200–400 nm, Δλ = 15/60 nm) were acquired at 298 K to probe alterations in the microenvironments of tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) residues induced by inhibitor binding, with spectral shifts interpreted in terms of polarity and hydrophobicity changes [ 39 40 The synchronous fluorescence quenching ratio or RSFQ was calculated using Formula (11) to compare the contributions of Tyr and Trp residues to the fluorescence quenching of six porphyrin compounds with amylase and glucosidase.

Three-Dimensional Fluorescence Spectroscopy At 298 K, with excitation wavelengths ranging from 200 to 600 nm (2 nm increments) and emission wavelengths from 200 to 600 nm, the influence of small molecules on enzyme conformation was assessed by examining peaks in 3D fluorescence spectra [ 41 2.8. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy A molar ratio of 1:2 (α-amylase/α-glucosidase)–porphyrin solution was placed in a cryocentrifugal concentrator and the dried solid sample was mixed with dry KBr and measured using a Nicolet IS-50 FTIR Spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) with a scanning range of 4000–400 cm −1 −1 −1 42 2.9. Molecular Docking The crystal structures of α-amylase (PDB ID: 1OSE) and α-glucosidase (PDB ID: 5ZCB) from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) were downloaded. Using the Protein Preparation Workflow module in Schrödinger software (2019), hydrogens were added, charges were assigned, and the protonation states and hydrogen bonding networks of the proteins and ligands were optimized. The optimized lowest-energy conformation of the ligand was used as the input structure for docking. Molecular docking was performed using the Glide XP (extra precision) mode. The potential binding modes of porphyrin-based compounds with α-amylase and α-glucosidase were analyzed. 2.10.

Cytotoxicity Assay The cytotoxicity of six porphyrin compounds against human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells was evaluated using the MTT assay.

Effect of Porphyrins on the Synchronized Fluorescence Spectra In Figure 15 Figure 16 Figure 17 Figure 18 3.6.1. Effect of Porphyrins on the Synchronized Fluorescence Spectra of α-AMY In the α-amylase–TAPP system, the maximum emission wavelength of tyrosine and tryptophan residues in the α-amylase–TAPP system showed no significant shift. This indicates that TAPP essentially does not alter the microenvironment of Tyr and Trp within α-amylase, exerting only a minimal effect on the polarity and hydrophobicity surrounding these residues. For the α-amylase–THPP system, a slight blue shift occurred in the Tyr emission maximum while the Trp peak remained unchanged, suggesting reduced polarity and increased hydrophobicity around Tyr residues but no significant Trp perturbation. Increasing TCPP concentrations induced blue shifts in both Tyr and Trp emission maxima, signifying decreased polarity and increased hydrophobicity around these residues. With increasing Fe–TCPP concentrations, Tyr synchronous fluorescence showed a blue shift but Trp exhibited a red shift, indicating reduced polarity/hydrophobicity around Tyr residues versus increased polarity/decreased hydrophobicity around Trp residues (implying greater Trp solvent exposure). For Ni–TCPP, no Tyr spectral shift occurred, but Trp showed a red shift, demonstrating minimal Tyr effects but increased polarity/reduced hydrophobicity around Trp. Conversely, Cu–TCPP induced a Trp blue shift without altering Tyr spectra, indicating decreased polarity/increased hydrophobicity specifically around Trp residues. As depicted in Figure 15 Figure 16 3.6.2. Effect of Porphyrins on the Synchronized Fluorescence Spectra of α-GLU For THPP, Ni–TCPP, Fe–TCPP, TCPP, and Cu–TCPP, concentration-dependent blue shifts in both Tyr and Trp emission maxima demonstrated decreased polarity and enhanced hydrophobicity around these residues during enzyme binding. In contrast, the α-glucosidase–TAPP system exhibited only a slight Tyr blue shift with unaltered Trp emission, indicating a localized reduction in Tyr polarity/hydrophobicity and minimal Trp perturbation. In Figure 17 Figure 18 3.7. Effect of Porphyrins on the Three-Dimensional Fluorescence Spectra of Enzymes Fluorescence peak 1 primarily reveals the spectral signature of Trp and Tyr residues, and peak 2 represents changes in peptide chain conformation. 3.7.1.

Effect of Porphyrins on the Three-Dimensional Fluorescence Spectra of α-Glucosidase In Figure 20 Table 8 3.8. Effect of Porphyrins on the Infrared Spectrum of Enzymes 3.8.1. Effect of Porphyrins on the Infrared Spectrum of α-Amylase For proteins, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy provides information on amino group vibrations, where the amide I band (C=O stretching) and amide II band (N-H bending or C-N stretching) are particularly relevant to this study. These bands correspond to wavenumber ranges of 1700–1600 cm −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 46 Deconvolution of the amide I band in the FT-IR spectra of α-amylase and its complexes with porphyrin compounds yielded Figure 21 Table 9 The above results demonstrate that TAPP, THPP, TCPP, Ni–TCPP, Cu–TCPP, and Fe–TCPP induce alterations in the secondary structure of α-amylase. Given that hydrogen bonds maintain the stability of protein secondary structures, the observed structural changes suggest potential disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network within α-amylase. This destabilizes the enzyme’s conformation, resulting in structural flexibility and instability. Consequently, it may impair the formation of the active site and/or hinder substrate access to the catalytic center, ultimately reducing α-amylase activity. 3.8.2.

Molecular Docking Analysis of Porphyrins with α-Amylase Figure 23 As shown in Table 11 3.9.2. Molecular Docking Analysis of Porphyrins with α-Glucosidase Figure 24 As shown in Table 12 Molecular docking is primarily based on static, thermodynamically dominated predictions of binding affinity, while experimentally measured inhibitory activities, such as IC 50 Kᵢ Analysis of the structure–activity relationship of tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives bearing hydroxyl, amino, and carboxyl groups against three enzymes revealed that the hydroxyl group can form one and three hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues of α-amylase and α-glucosidase, respectively. The high absolute values of binding energy and strong inhibitory activity indicate that the hydroxyl group enhances the inhibition of both enzymes by forming hydrogen bonds with their amino acid residues. This may be attributed to the ability of the hydroxyl group to stabilize the electron cloud balance on the porphyrin macrocycle and increase its electron density. Meanwhile, the π–π stacking between the porphyrin macrocycle and amino acid residues improves the stability of the electron clouds in the α-amylase–THPP and α-glucosidase–THPP complexes, thereby strengthening the binding of THPP to the enzymes and enhancing its inhibitory activity. In contrast, the carboxyl group exhibited lower absolute values of both experimentally determined inhibitory activity and docking-simulated binding energy compared to the hydroxyl group. This may be due to the disruption of electron cloud balance by the carboxyl group, which reduces the electron density of the porphyrin macrocycle and destabilizes the π–π stacking. The amino group, however, can form three hydrogen bonds with α-glucosidase and a salt bridge with α-amylase, both of which play critical roles in stabilizing the enzyme–TAPP complex conformation. As an electron-donating group, the amino group increases the electron density on the porphyrin macrocycle and enhances the stability of π–π stacking, thereby contributing to the improved inhibitory activity. 3.10. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Analysis of Porphyrins and Enzymes 3.10.1. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Analysis of Porphyrins and α-Amylase The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) quantifies the positional divergence of a system’s conformation from its initial state during the simulation timeframe [ 47 Figure 25 3.10.2. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Analysis of Porphyrins and α-Glucosidase In Figure 26 3.11. Cytotoxicity Analysis of Porphyrins Figure 27 When the concentration of Cu–TCPP and TCPP increased to 200 μg/mL, the survival rate of HepG2 cells decreased sharply to (43.13 ± 5.53%) and (30.26 ± 3.45%), respectively. For Fe–TCPP, at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, the cell viability was only (60.40 ± 5.69%). As the concentration further increased to 200 μg/mL, the viability declined to (55.41 ± 0.93%), a slower rate of decrease compared to Cu–TCPP and TCPP, indicating relatively lower cytotoxic activity. THPP exhibited certain cytotoxic effects on HepG2 cells across the entire concentration range (50–200 μg/mL), demonstrating significant inhibitory and killing activity against liver cancer cells. This observed cytotoxicity may be attributed to two factors: firstly, the inherent toxicity of THPP within the 50–200 μg/mL concentration range, as well as that of high concentrations of Cu–TCPP, TCPP, and Fe–TCPP; secondly, the specific affinity of porphyrin compounds for cancer cells may enable selective accumulation within tumor cells, allowing them to act as antitumor photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT) to effectively kill cancer cells. 3.12. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Results As shown in Table 13 48 49 4. Conclusions α-Amylase and α-glucosidase are key digestive enzymes involved in blood glucose regulation. Inhibiting these enzymes can contribute to the prevention and management of diabetes. However, clinically used enzyme inhibitors often exhibit various adverse effects, making the search for alternative drugs to avoid or reduce these side effects a major research focus in the field of diabetes. Based on this context, this study investigates the inhibitory effects on these two enzymes, with the main conclusions summarized as follows. Firstly, for α-amylase, the order of inhibitory effectiveness was TAPP > THPP > TCPP > Fe–TCPP > Ni–TCPP > Cu–TCPP. For α-glucosidase, the order was THPP > Ni–TCPP > Fe–TCPP > TCPP > Cu–TCPP > TAPP. Among these, TAPP and THPP showed stronger inhibition against α-amylase than acarbose. However, for α-glucosidase inhibition, all six compounds were less effective than acarbose, with THPP and Ni–TCPP being the closest to acarbose and still demonstrating strong inhibitory effects. Research indicates that except for Ni–TCPP acting as a non-competitive inhibitor of α-amylase and THPP as a non-competitive inhibitor of α-glucosidase, the other compounds exhibit mixed-type inhibition toward both enzymes. Fluorescence quenching experiments further reveal that the binding between the compounds and the enzymes is primarily static quenching, resulting in the formation of ground-state complexes, with most compounds binding at a single site. Structure–activity relationship analysis demonstrates that different functional groups and metal centers significantly influence inhibitory activity and selectivity. For instance, TAPP and THPP, containing electron-donating groups (-NH 2 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions All authors contributed to the study’s conception and design.
