Introduction Radiotherapy (RT) is essential for treating brain and neck tumors but damages healthy brain tissue [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Mechanistically, brain radiation therapy (RT) damages multiple central nervous system (CNS) cell types (e.g., astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, neural stem cells), triggering early neuroinflammatory responses [ 7 8 Current pharmacological interventions for radiation-induced neural damage remain limited [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a natural bioactive flavonoid component isolated from the roots of licorice, including Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Mongolian glycyrrhiza, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and so on [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Previously, we have demonstrated that Dragon’s Blood (DB), a non-toxic, brown-red resin extracted from Dracaena cochinchinensis 25 26 27 Given that proteomics can comprehensively reflect the regulation of ISL’s radiation mitigation, 4D-DIA proteomic profiling of rat brain tissues was conducted. Pathway enrichment revealed that ISL’s radiation mitigation is mainly related to synaptic vesicle cycle, the glutamatergic synapse, the MAPK signaling pathway, SNARE interactions in vesicular transport, the insulin signaling pathway, and insulin secretion. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), four ensembled machine learning models, and the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network further prioritized 12 key proteins. Among these, glutamate receptors Grik3, Grm8, and Grin3a were identified as ISL’s key radiation mitigation targets based on functional annotation. Molecular docking predicted strong binding affinity between ISL and these receptors, and molecular dynamics simulations further supported the stability of these ISL–receptor complexes. In summary, this work establishes ISL as a potent natural radiation protectant that modulates glutamate homeostasis and synaptic plasticity primarily through targeting glutamate receptors Grik3, Grm8, and Grin3a. 2. Results 2.1. Isoliquiritigenin’s Protection Effect Against Radiation-Induced Damage at the Cellular Level To evaluate the cytoprotective potential of ISL against radiation-induced cellular damage, HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells were employed. For comparative analysis, four known metabotropic glutamate receptor modulators were selected ( Figure 1 28 29 30 31 To determine radioprotective effects at the cellular level, cell viability was quantified using CCK-8 assay, which measures metabolic activity as an indicator of live cells ( Figure 1 Figure S1 Membrane integrity was evaluated via an LDH release measurement, where extracellular LDH indicates plasma membrane damage ( Figure 1 Bioenergetic status was assessed through ATP quantification, reflecting mitochondrial function and cellular energy reserves, as shown in Figure 1 Excitotoxic stress was evaluated by measuring intracellular glutamate, where elevated levels indicate neuronal overexcitation, as shown in Figure 1 Antioxidant capacity was determined via reduced glutathione (GSH) quantification, a critical endogenous free radical scavenger. As shown in Figure 1 To further study the antioxidant ability of ISL, the DCFH-DA probe was used for ROS fluorescence imaging. The fluorescence intensity is proportional to the level of intracellular ROS ( Figure 1 Table S2 2.2. Isoliquiritigenin’s Radiation Mitigation Effect Against Radiation Damage at the Animal Level To investigate the effect of ISL against radiation-induced damage at the animal level, a Wistar rat model of whole-brain irradiation injury (30 Gy [ 32 33 34 Specifically, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to evaluate gross structural integrity in the hippocampus, while molecular analyses quantified synaptic integrity via PSD-95 expression and neuroinflammation via IL-1β levels. Furthermore, dendritic spine density and morphology were analyzed to assess synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity changes. To visualize radiation-induced structural alterations and ISL’s radiation mitigation effects in the hippocampal formation, H&E staining was performed on rat brain sections. Significant histological alterations were observed in the hippocampus three days after irradiation. In the CON group ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 To further evaluate the radiation-induced effect and the radiation mitigation effect of ISL across the entire hippocampal formation, quantitative neuronal counts on hemibrain sections were conducted. The average number of neurons in the CON group was 2414 ± 92, while the RAD group showed a significant reduction, with an average count of 1970 ± 21. In contrast, ISL treatment significantly restored neuronal numbers, yielding an average count of 2674 ± 154, indicating a notable mitigation of radiation-induced neuronal loss. There was not a significant difference between groups in the body weights before radiation. On the third day after irradiation, the average body weights of the CON group, RAD group, and ISL group were 250.1 ± 13.6 g, 225.3 ± 11.0 g, and 232.5 ± 8.0 g. The average body weight of the RAD and ISL groups slightly decreased compared to that of the CON group ( Figure 2 35 Figure 2 To evaluate the impact of radiation and ISL on neuroinflammation, the relative level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β was measured ( Figure 2 To assess changes in brain synaptic integrity associated with radiation damage and ISL, the relative mRNA expression levels of the synaptic marker PSD-95 were quantified, ( Figure 2 To investigate the effects on synaptic plasticity, which is closely reflected by dendritic spine density and morphology, quantitative analysis of different spine types was performed on dendrites. Spine density is correlated with synaptic strength and connectivity. Four distinct morphological types were assessed: stubby spines, filopodium-like spines, mushroom spines, and slender spines. Stubby spine density ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 To further characterize the impact of radiation and ISL on neuronal structure, the morphology of dendrites was examined under high magnification (1000×) on the third day post-irradiation ( Figure 2 These findings demonstrate that ISL provides mitigation against radiation-induced hippocampal damage in rats. For the significance test, the effect sizes and confidence intervals are reported in Table S3 2.3. Analysis of Isoliquiritigenin-Related Radiation Mitigation Mechanism Based on Proteomics To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the radiation mitigation effects of ISL, proteomic analysis of rat brain tissue was conducted. The principal component analysis (PCA) plot of 15 samples is shown in Figure S2 p Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure S3 KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the 4074 radiation-induced DEPs and the 668 ISL radiation mitigation-related DEPs. For radiation-induced DEPs ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 4 KEGG pathway enrichment revealed that ISL’s radiation mitigation mechanism predominantly involves the modulation of the glutamatergic synapse, MAPK signaling pathway, and synaptic vesicle cycle pathways. These findings align with the observed phenotypic effects. At the cellular level, the normalization of radiation-induced elevated intracellular glutamate and the restoration of ATP levels by ISL directly correspond to the reversal of perturbations in these key pathways. At the animal level, ISL’s significant up-regulation of PSD-95 expression (counteracting radiation-induced down-regulation), reduction in IL-1β levels (counteracting radiation-induced up-regulation, a key MAPK pathway output), and preservation of dendritic spine density and morphology provide functional validation of the proteomic-identified KEGG pathways. This multi-level concordance supports the central role of glutamatergic signaling regulation, MAPK pathway modulation, and synaptic vesicle machinery in ISL-mediated radiation mitigation. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to characterize the functions of radiation-induced and ISL radiation mitigation-related DEPs. For radiation-induced damage ( Figure 5 Figure 5 For the cellular component in GO enrichment, radiation-induced DEPs ( Figure 5 Figure 5 For the molecular function in GO enrichment, radiation-related MFs ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Finally, an Upset plot was generated to visualize the intersection of genes mapped to 18 KEGG pathways enriched in ISL radiation mitigation-related DEPs ( Figure 3 2.4. WGCNA of Co-Expression Proteins Related to Isoliquiritigenin’s Radiation Mitigation The co-expression protein networks implicated in the radiation mitigation mechanisms of ISL were investigated through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Since the radiation mitigation effect of ISL was primarily aimed at mitigating radiation-induced damage compared to the CON group, there is potential correlation between the ISL and CON groups. Therefore, a WGCNA of all three groups ( n The initial phase of a WGCNA is hierarchical clustering and soft threshold search. For the CON and RAD groups, hierarchical clustering identified three primary subgroups: (CON-2, CON-4, CON-5), (RAD-5, RAD-3, RAD-1, RAD-2), and (CON-3, RAD-4, CON-1) ( Figure S4A Figure S4B,C Figure 6 Figure 6 The topological overlap matrix (TOM) dendrogram and module–trait correlations are shown in Figure 6 p Therefore, the 2211 proteins in Teal module were identified as key proteins related to ISL radiation mitigation by WGCNA. The intersection between 2211 proteins (in the Teal module) and 140 genes from KEGG-enriched radiation mitigation pathways are regarded as ISL radiation mitigation-related key proteins at this stage. In total, 83 proteins were found to overlap ( Figure 6 Figure 6 2.5. Identification of Key Radiation-Induced and Isoliquiritigenin Radiation Mitigation-Related Proteins Using Four Machine Learning Models Four machine learning models, LASSO, Random Forest, SVM, and Elastic Net, were employed to further identify the key proteins related to ISL radiation mitigation from the above 83 proteins. For ISL radiation mitigation (ISL–RAD, Figure 7 n Figure 7 Table S4 2.6. Identification of Key Isoliquiritigenin Radiation Mitigation-Related Targets Based on Protein–Protein Interaction Networks, KEGG/GO Enrichment and Functional Annotation Consensus analysis across the above-mentioned four machine learning models revealed 25 ISL radiation mitigation-related proteins (6 + 1 + 18) consistently identified by at least 3 machine learning models ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 p Table 1 Functional enrichment analysis revealed predominantly enriched pathways centered on neuronal communication. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis ( Figure 8 Figure 8 KEGG analysis identified the “glutamatergic synapse” as the most significantly enriched pathway, involving five proteins (Grin3a, Gng10, Grm8, Prkaca, Grik3). GO molecular function analysis specifically highlighted “glutamate receptor activity”, exclusively attributed to Grin3a, Grm8, and Grik3, within the 12-protein cluster, defining their role in glutamate binding and signal initiation. GO cellular component analysis further revealed significant enrichment at the “synaptic membrane”, where the glutamate receptors Grik3, Grm8, and Grin3a are integral postsynaptic membrane proteins. This localization positions them as the primary receptors for synaptic glutamate signaling and makes them directly accessible to potential modulators ISL. In contrast, proteins such as Prkaca, Araf, Ddit3, Maoa, and the SNARE components (Stx17, Vamp2, Vti1b) function primarily within the cytoplasm or on intracellular vesicles, representing downstream effectors or supporting machinery rather than the primary signal receptors. Therefore, based on the KEGG and GO enrichment results, the glutamate receptors Grik3, Grm8, and Grin3a were identified as the most three probable targets for ISL’s radiation mitigation. Proteomic validation was focused on the candidate glutamate receptors Grik3, Grm8, and Grin3a. Radiation exposure significantly increased their expression compared to CON groups, and ISL normalizing levels to near control values ( Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 2.7. Validation of Interactions Between Isoliquiritigenin and Grik3, Grm8, Grin3a To validate the potential binding of ISL to the identified glutamate receptors, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed ( Table 2 Figure 10 Figure 10 Figure 10 ISL’s binding affinity was further compared to native ligands (glutamate for Grik3, Grm8; glycine for Grin3a). For Grik3, ISL exhibited stronger binding affinity (mean: −6.95 ± 0.32 kcal/mol) compared to glutamate (−6.23 ± 0.33 kcal/mol). Similarly, for Grm8, ISL demonstrated superior affinity (−6.36 ± 0.20 kcal/mol) over glutamate (−2.68 ± 0.06 kcal/mol). In Grin3a, ISL also showed enhanced binding (−8.09 ± 0.37 kcal/mol) relative to the native ligand glycine (−4.38 ± 0.07 kcal/mol) ( Figure 10 Comparative analysis of binding poses revealed distinct spatial- and residue-specific interactions for different receptors. For Grm8, ISL and the native ligand glutamate shared overlapping binding pockets, with both engaging ALA177 (hydrophobic) and adjacent residues ( Figure 10 Figure 10 Table S1 To further validate the interactions between ISL and receptors, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for 100 ns based on the most stable docking conformations. MD simulation serves as a powerful tool to explore the dynamic behavior and stability of ligand–receptor complexes over time, providing insights into conformational changes, interaction, and overall complex robustness under near-physiological conditions. Structural alignment analysis of the simulated receptor–ligand complexes revealed deviations from the original crystal structures ( Figure 11 Hydrogen bond (H-bond) dynamics were quantified throughout the simulation trajectory ( Figure 11 Root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis of the backbone atoms provides a measure of overall conformational stability relative to the starting structure ( Figure 11 Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) per residue assesses local flexibility, particularly highlighting regions like binding sites ( Figure 11 Solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) was monitored to evaluate changes in solvent exposure of the complex, which relates to ligand desolvation and hydrophobic packing stability ( Figure 11 2 2 2 Finally, the radius of gyration (Rg) was employed to assess the structural compactness of the receptor–ISL complexes ( Figure 11 In summary, molecular docking followed by 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations robustly validate interactions between ISL and the glutamate receptors Grik3, Grm8, and Grin3a. The observed binding stabilities, hydrogen bonding networks, and overall complex stability across multi metrics confirm stable ISL binding to all three receptors. Notably, although ISL binds to all three receptors, it exhibits distinct binding modes. For Grm8, the binding site coincides with that of the native ligand. However, for the other two receptors (Grik3 and Grin3a), the binding sites do not coincide with their respective native ligands, indicating that ISL likely interacts with Grik3 and Grin3a at alternative sites. 3. Discussion Radiotherapy for brain and neck tumors often damages healthy tissue, leading to cognitive decline and life-threatening complications like cerebral necrosis [ 8 36 37 38 Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays pivotal roles in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and cognitive function [ 39 40 41 42 43 Building upon cellular findings, ISL also demonstrated neuronal radiation mitigation efficacy in vivo. Behavioral assessments revealed that ISL attenuated radiation-induced hippocampal damage and associated functional deficits. Furthermore, ISL ameliorated radiation-triggered anhedonia, evidenced by restored sucrose preference. ISL preserved neuronal architecture and synaptic integrity histologically, suppressing neuroinflammation by IL-1β reduction, restoring PSD-95 synaptic marker, and maintaining dendritic spine density particularly plasticity-critical stubby and filopodium-like subtypes. These results confirm ISL’s capacity to mitigate radiation injury at the organismal level, preserving both hippocampal structure and affective function. Given the constraint of sample size ( n 44 45 In order to further explore the ISL’s core targets related to radiation mitigation, an integrated ensemble model (differentially expressed protein identification, pathway enrichment analysis, WGCNA, machine learning, and PPI) was used. Twelve key proteins were identified: Araf, Gng10, Grik3, Grin3a, Grm8, Maoa, Mt-nd1, Prkaca, Slc8a1, Stx17, Vamp2, and Vti1b. Functional clustering revealed their collective convergence on glutamate homeostasis and synaptic plasticity regulation. Grik3 and Grin3a directly modulate ionotropic glutamate receptor signaling [ 46 47 48 49 50 2+ 2+ 51 52 53 54 55 Figure 12 Overall, ISL is a naturally occurring flavonoid found in foods such as licorice. It exhibits a broad pharmacological spectrum and functions as a natural radio-modulatory agent. By targeting glutamate receptors such as Grm8, Grik3, and Grin3a, ISL modulates synaptic function and glutamate homeostasis, highlighting ISL as a novel natural product candidate for mitigating radiation-induced neural damage during radiotherapy. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cellular Studies 4.1.1. Cellular Culture and Treatment The HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (obtained from Qingqi (Shanghai) Biotechnology Development Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (catalog number: 11995065, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (catalog number: ST30-3302, PAN Biotech UK Ltd., Gateshead, UK), 1% non-essential amino acids (catalog number: 11140050, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (catalog number: 15140122, from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 For experimental procedures, HT22 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 6 × 10 4 v v 60 56 57 60 58 4.1.2. Cell Viability Assay (CCK-8) HT22 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (catalog number: ASO-CC-9534-01, Meryer Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at a density of 6000 cells/well in 100 μL complete medium and incubated overnight (at 37 °C) for attachment. After 24 h post-radiation incubation, cellular viability was assessed using the CCK-8 kit (catalog number CA1210, Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) following the kit instructions. Cell viability was calculated as a percentage relative to the absorbance (using microplate reader, model CYTATION3, BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) of the non-irradiated control group. 4.1.3. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Measurement Following a 24 h post-radiation incubation, lactate dehydrogenase was evaluated using a commercial lactate dehydrogenase assay kit (catalog number C0017, Beyotime Biotechnology, Beijing, China) following the kit instruction (25 °C). This assay was performed on the same set of cells used for the cell viability assay (three replicates). Absorbance was measured (microplate reader, model CYTATION3 from BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) at 490 nm (primary signal) with a reference wavelength of 600 nm to correct for background interference. 4.1.4. ATP Quantification Following a 24 h post-radiation incubation, intracellular ATP levels were quantified using a commercial ATP detection kit (catalog number S0026, Beyotime Biotechnology, Beijing, China) following kit instructions. An ATP standard curve was prepared by serially diluting the ATP standard solution in lysis buffer. For measurement, 100 μL of ATP detection working solution was added per well of an opaque microplate and equilibrated at room temperature for 3–5 min. Subsequently, 20 μL of sample or standard was added to each well, mixed immediately, and luminance intensity was measured after a minimum 2 s delay using a luminometer (microplate reader with luminescence module, model CYTATION3 from BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). ATP concentrations were calculated from the standard curve and normalized to total protein concentration (determined separately), using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (catalog number P0012, Beyotime Biotechnology, Beijing, China). All procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C to maintain ATP stability. 4.1.5. Measurement of Glutamate Intracellular glutamate concentration was quantified 24 h post-radiation using a commercial glutamate content assay kit (model BC1585 from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Cells were collected. Culture medium was completely aspirated from the culture plate without disturbing the cell monolayer. The cells were washed with pre-cooled sterile PBS (1×, pH 7.4) to remove residual serum and metabolites, after which the PBS was thoroughly aspirated. An appropriate volume of trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) (catalog number: MKL-T917516, Meryer Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was added to cover the cell layer, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1–2 min until cell rounding and detachment were observed under a microscope (Nikon, ECLIPSE E100, Tokyo, Japan). Digestion was terminated by adding complete medium supplemented with serum, and the cells were gently pipetted to generate a single-cell suspension. The suspension was transferred to a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Finaly, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was retained for further processing. Cell pellets were resuspended in Reagent One in the kit (1 mL per 10 million cells). Cell lysis was achieved by ultrasonication (model S-250D from Branson Ultrasonics Co., Danbury, CT, USA). Lysates were centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 10 min, room temperature). The supernatant was collected for analysis. For the assay, 40 μL of sample (or standard) was added to wells of a 96-well UV plate, followed by 160 μL Reagent Three in the kit and 10 μL Reagent Four in the kit. After gentle mixing, the absorbance at 340 nm was measured immediately (using the microplate reader, model CYTATION3 from BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) (A1 at 20 s) and after 5 min 20 s (A2). According to the kit instructions, a standard curve was constructed using known concentrations of glutamate standard included in the kit. Glutamate concentration was calculated based on the change in absorbance (ΔA = A1 − A2) and comparison to standard curve, reflecting radiation-induced alterations in glutamate metabolism. 4.1.6. Reduced Glutathione (GSH) Quantification Intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were quantified using a commercial GSH content assay kit (catalog number JYM1319Ra, Wuhan ColorfulGene Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China). Twenty-four hours post-radiation treatment, cells were collected following the procedure above, washed twice with PBS (600× g g 4.1.7. Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) To measure the intracellular ROS levels, a commercial DCFH-DA probe (Solarbio, Beijing, China) was used. For this, 6 h after radiation, a concentration of 10 μmol/L DCFH-DA was added to the treated HT22 cells, which were then incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS to remove any unbound probe. Fluorescence imaging was performed using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope (with an inverted Nikon Ti-E body, a perfect focus system, and a 5% CO 2 4.2. Animal Studies 4.2.1. Animal Model of Radiation Wistar wild-type male rats (5–6 weeks) were supplied by SiBeiFu Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China. Upon arrival, rats were maintained in a sterile housing condition at 25 °C, with a 12 h light/dark cycle and rats had free access to food and water. This study was approved by the Animal Care and Utilization Committee of Beijing Institute of Technology (Beijing, China) (Project No. BIT-EC-SCXK2019-0010-R-011). After three days of adaptive feeding, 15 healthy male rats were randomly divided into three groups, with each group having 5 rats. The control group (CON) rats were given 10 mL/kg distilled water containing 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (catalog number: M88146 59 60 32 33 34 4.2.2. Sucrose Preference Test The sucrose preference test (SPF) was performed on each group of rats immediately after radiation. Rats were individually caged in a quiet, soundproof room before the test. On the first day, rats were habituated with 1% sucrose (catalog number: MKL-S982424, Meryer Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 24 h. On the second day, the rats were habituated with two bottles, one with 1% sucrose and the other with pure water. For the next 24 h, the rats were not given food or water. During the last 1hr, the rats were given 1% sucrose and pure water. Sucrose preference percentage (%) was calculated following the Formula (1): Sucrose preference percentage (%) = sucrose intake (mL)/total intake (mL) × 100%. (1) 4.2.3. Histopathological Analysis The rats were sacrificed on the third day after irradiation, and the rat brains were excised and completely immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) for histopathological analysis. The brain tissue was fixed for 24–26 h, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Standard histological processing was performed; tissues were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (SCRC, 100092683, Shanghai, China) using a dehydrator (DIAPATH, Donatello, Montichiari, Italy), cleared in xylene (SCRC, 10023418, Shanghai, China) or Environmentally Friendly Dewaxing Transparent Liquid (Servicebio, G1128-1L, Wuhan, China), and embedded in paraffin using an embedding machine (Wuhan Junjie, JB-P5, Wuhan, China). Paraffin blocks were sectioned at 4 μm thickness with a rotary microtome (Shanghai Leica, RM2016, Shanghai, China), mounted on adhesive slides (Servicebio, G6012-1, Wuhan, China), and air-dried. For H&E staining, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, then stained with hematoxylin (Servicebio, G1076, Wuhan, China) for 5 min, differentiated, blued, and counterstained with eosin for 5 s. Dehydration was performed through graded ethanol and normal butanol (SCRC, 100052190, Shanghai, China), followed by xylene clearance and mounting with neutral gum (SCRC, 10004160, Shanghai, China) and cover glasses (Citotest, 10212432C, Jiangsu, China). Processed sections were examined under an upright optical microscope (Nikon, ECLIPSE E100, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an imaging system (Nikon, DS-U3, Tokyo, Japan) to assess cell morphology, inflammatory infiltration, and other pathological features. To assess the radiation-induced histopathological damage and the radiation mitigation efficacy of ISL, scoring was employed by three independent pathologists blinded to the experimental groups (service provided by Wuhan Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China). The evaluation was performed on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections focusing on the overall hippocampal formation, and specific subregions including the CA2 area and the dentate gyrus (DG). The scoring criteria were based on the extent of structural disorganization, neuronal pyknosis, eosinophilia, vacuolation, and reduction in neuronal density. Each parameter was graded on a scale of 0 to 3. 0, normal morphology; 1—mild changes; 2—moderate damage; and 3—severe histopathological alterations. The final score for each image was derived from the average of scores assigned by the three evaluators. For quantitative analysis of neuronal density in the hemibrain hippocampal formation, the total number of neurons in the hippocampus of each hemibrain section was counted using the Image-Pro Plus 6.0 analysis software (Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.2.4. Measurement of Inflammatory Factors IL-1β in the Brain Tissue The level of IL-1β in the rat brain tissue was determined by the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (catalog number: YX-091201R from Shanghai Guduo Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), following the instructions of the ELISA kits. 4.2.5. Golgi-Cox Staining Analysis A sharp blade was used to cut a 5–10 mm thick tissue block from the hippocampus of the fixed rat brain tissue. The tissue block to be observed was then quickly rinsed with distilled water to remove any blood. The rat brain tissue block was placed in the G1069-30ML (Wuhan Service Bio Technology, Wuhan, China) bottle. The staining fixative was poured into a special waste liquid bucket in the fume hood. It was replaced with the Golgi staining (Wuhan, China) solution to completely immerse the tissue block, which was then placed in a cool and ventilated place at 26 °C and away from light for a total of 14 days. After an immersion period of 48 h, the staining solution was replaced with a new solution; subsequent replacements occurred every 3 days. After staining was completed, the staining solution was poured into a special waste liquid bucket in the fume hood. The tissue was then treated with a new tissue treatment solution after 1 h of treatment and treated at 4 °C and away from light for 3 days. The brain tissue was attached to the tray of the vibration slicer (Wuhan, China) using 502 super glue and immersed in the tissue treatment solution. Sections were cut at 60 μm and, after cutting, were transferred to a slide with the help of a brush. After picking up the slice, tissue treatment solution was added onto its surface, and it was left to dry for a short while before development. The slice was washed with ultrapure water, developed with Golgi developer (Wuhan, China) for 30 min, and then washed with water. Any excess water on the slide was carefully wiped off, and the slice was finally sealed with glycerol gelatin. 4.2.6. RT-qPCR Analysis Total RNA was extracted from brain tissue using the reagent kit (catalog number R0024, Beyotime Biotechnology, Beijing, China), following the kit’s instructions. The resulting RNA samples were subsequently reverse transcribed into complementary DNA using the reagent kit (model M-MLV, Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). The RT-qPCR was performed by real-time PCR (IQ5, Bio-Rad) utilizing GAPDH as a housekeeping gene. The expression of each gene was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The forward primer sequence of PSD95 was AGACGGTGACGCAGATGGAA. The reverse primer sequence of PSD95 was TCGGGGAACTCGGAGAGAAG. The forward primer sequence of GAPDH was CTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATG. The reverse primer sequence of GAPDH was GGTGGAAGAATGGGAGTTGCT. The relative expression levels (fold change) of each target gene were normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA levels in each sample using the 2 −∆∆CT 4.2.7. 4D-DIA Proteomic Analysis 4D-DIA proteomics data acquisition Tissue samples were individually pulverized in liquid nitrogen. The resulting powder was lysed using SDT buffer (containing 100 mM NaCl) supplemented with 1/100 volume DTT, followed by ultrasonication (model S-250D from Branson Ultrasonics Co., Danbury, CT, USA) on ice for 5 min. Lysates were incubated at 95 °C for 8–15 min, immediately cooled on ice for 2 min, and centrifuged at 12,000× g g Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay kit (model P0006 from Beyotime Biotechnology, Beijing, China). A standard curve was generated using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions ranging from 0 to 0.5 g/L. Both BSA standards and diluted sample solutions (20 µL final volume per well) were loaded in triplicate onto a 96-well plate. Following the rapid addition of 180 µL G250 dye reagent to each well, the plate was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Absorbance was measured at 595 nm, and sample protein concentrations were calculated based on the standard curve. For quality assessment, 20 µg of each protein sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 120 V through the stacking gel (20 min) and 150 V through the resolving gel (50 min). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 reagent and destained until bands were clearly defined. Protein samples were adjusted to a final volume of 100 µL with DB lysis buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate [TEAB], pH 8.5). Samples were digested with trypsin at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by a second addition of trypsin and overnight digestion. The digestion was terminated by acidification with formic acid to pH less than 3. Acidified samples were centrifuged at 12,000× g Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted in 10 µL of mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water). After centrifugation at 14,000× g The elution gradient begins at time zero (0 min) with a flow rate of 2.5 µL/min and a mobile phase composition of 96% A and 4% B. At 0.2 min, the flow rate decreases to 1.3 µL/min while maintaining the same mobile phase ratio (96% A/4% B). At 0.3 min, the flow rate further decreases to 0.8 µL/min as the composition shifts to 92% A and 8% B, remaining stable at these conditions until 0.5 min. Between 0.5 min and 14.2 min, the flow rate holds at 0.8 µL/min while the mobile phase gradually changes to 77.5% A/22.5% B at the 14.2 min mark. By 21.1 min, still at 0.8 µL/min, the composition reaches 65% A/35% B. Subsequently, at 21.5 min, the flow rate increases to 2.5 µL/min concurrent with a shift to 45% A/55% B and initiation of a Column Wash step. At 21.9 min, the mobile phase rapidly transitions to 1% A/99% B while maintaining the 2.5 µL/min flow rate, and this condition persists until the run stops at 22.6 min. Eluting peptides were analyzed using a Thermo Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with an Easy-Spray (ESI) ion source. The key mass spectrometry parameters were as follows: spray voltage—2.0 kV; ion transfer tube temperature—290 °C; full MS1 scan range— m z m z m z Quality control The mass spectrometry data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer software (version 2.1) for database searching. Searches were performed against the UniProtKB database restricted to the species Rattus norvegicus. A false discovery rate threshold set at less than 1% was applied for peptide spectrum matches, peptides, and proteins. Proteins with at least 4 missing values in any single group (CON/RAD/ISL) were removed. Proteins exhibiting at least 3 missing values in at least two groups were excluded. Differential expression analysis for proteomic Differential expression analysis was performed using UniProt IDs as identifiers derived from database searching. Homogeneity of variance between groups was evaluated using Levene’s test with an alpha level of 0.01. Proteins exhibiting a Levene’s p t p Pathway enrichment analysis Functional enrichment analysis was conducted using the STRING platform (version 12.0). This analysis utilized the STRING API and Python (version 3.10.16). The species was specified as Rattus norvegicus, identified by NCBI taxon ID 10116. The STRING enrichment method was employed with default parameter settings. For proteins intended for enrichment analysis, UniProt IDs were converted to gene names using the online UniProt ID mapping tool ( https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping 4.2.8. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed using the OmicVerse package [ 60 p p 4.2.9. Four Machine Learning Models for Identifying Key Proteins To identify key proteins distinguishing radiation-induced damage and ISL-related radiation mitigation, four machine learning models (LASSO, Random Forest, Linear Support Vector Machine, Elastic Net logistic regression, as outlined below) were implemented using scikit-learn (version 1.5.2) in Python (version 3.10.16). Therefore, the computational tasks for the machine learning models are formulated as binary classification tasks. For RAD ( n n n n LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-regularized logistic regression was applied for feature selection using L1 penalty. The model was configured with an inverse regularization strength C = 10,000 (minimal regularization), ‘liblinear’ solver, and maximum iterations = 10,000. Proteins with non-zero coefficients were sorted and selected. Random Forest was used for non-linear feature importance assessment. A total of 1000 trees with ‘sqrt’ mode ‘max_features’ and Gini impurity splitting criterion are included. Feature importance was calculated as mean Gini impurity reduction across all trees. Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with L2 penalty was implemented for maximum margin separation. The regularization parameter C was set as 0.1. The regularization parameter-controlled margin strictness, with a linear kernel for interpretable coefficients. Feature weights were extracted from the primal hyperplane coefficients. Elastic Net logistic regression combined L1 and L2 penalties (L1_ratio was set as 0.01) using the ‘saga’ settings. The regularization parameter C was set as 0.1. Max_iter was set as 10,000. This balanced feature selection and coefficient stability (correlation handling). The absolute values of signed coefficients in LASSO, 0–1 scaled Gini importance scores in Random Forest, signed hyperplane coefficients in SVM, and signed coefficients in Elastic Net are defined as coefficient or importance. Proteins were ranked by the absolute values per model–task combination. The top 30 proteins are selected for each model. 4.2.10. Protein–Protein Interaction Network Analysis The protein–protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database (version 12.0, accessed on 20 December 2024). The analysis was restricted to the target species Rattus norvegicus (taxonomic identifier: 10116). Functional and physical protein associations were retrieved. A minimum interaction confidence score threshold of 0.300 was applied. 4.3. Molecular Docking Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock Vina [ 61 62 63 4.4. Molecular Dynamic Analysis The protein–ligand complex was prepared using the Amber LEaP module [ 64 + − 2 2 2 2 −1 65 4.5. Statistic Methods The experimental results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation ( n 66 67 n t t t t 5. Conclusions This study systematically investigated the neuronal radiation mitigation related effects of ISL against radiation-induced neuronal damage using a multi-modal experimental approach. Key findings demonstrate ISL’s radiation mitigation potential across biological scales. In vitro analyses revealed that ISL treatment markedly reduced radiation-induced cytotoxicity, as evidenced by decreased LDH leakage and ROS generation, while restoring cellular ATP levels and preventing pathological glutamate accumulation. In vivo validation showed ISL administration effectively attenuated radiation-related anhedonia behaviors and preserved hippocampal synaptic integrity in rodent models. High-throughput proteomic profiling identified multiple pathways modulated by ISL, mainly including synaptic vesicle recycling, glutamatergic transmission, MAPK cascade, SNARE-mediated exocytosis, and insulin signaling networks. Through integrated proteomics and AI-driven analysis, ISL’s core targets—glutamate receptors Grik3, Grm8, and Grin3a—were identified, with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrating ISL’s superior binding stability at these receptor sites compared to endogenous ligands. In summary, these results establish ISL as a promising natural therapeutic candidate with multi-target efficacy against radiotherapy-induced neural injury, acting through synergistic modulation of excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and synaptic maintenance pathways.
