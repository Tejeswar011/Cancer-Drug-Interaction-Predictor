Introduction Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the esophagus, characterized by T-helper Type 2 (Th2)–driven inflammation. It can present across the lifespan, from childhood to late adulthood, and is defined by esophageal dysfunction with mucosal eosinophilia in the absence of alternative causes [ 1 2 3 4 5 Cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are central mediators of disease; however, therapeutic trials targeting eosinophils have yielded inconsistent clinical results [ 6 Epidemiologically, EoE has shown a sharp rise in incidence and prevalence over the past two decades [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 9 13 13 14 15 16 17 Symptomatology differs across age groups ( Table 1 13 18 19 20 16 17 18 19 In pediatric populations, the clinical presentation of EoE differs substantially from that observed in adults. Infants and toddlers often exhibit non-specific symptoms such as reflux-like complaints, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, food refusal, and failure to thrive (FTT) [ 20 21 Complications of EoE arise primarily from defective remodeling of the inflamed esophagus, including fibrosis, angiogenesis, and smooth muscle hypertrophy [ 22 Taken together, while pediatric EoE is well-recognized to follow an age-dependent symptom trajectory and carries risk for long-term fibrostenotic complications, the evidence base remains methodologically heterogeneous and geographically skewed toward Western cohorts. Robust multicenter, longitudinal studies across diverse regions are needed to clarify risk factors for progression and to inform global management strategies. 2. Endoscopic Findings Although no single pathognomonic endoscopic finding defines EoE, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) remains the first diagnostic step in patients presenting with dysphagia for solids [ 23 24 Figure 1 To standardize reporting, the Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) was developed, incorporating five major endoscopic features (edema, rings, exudates, furrows, and strictures) [ 25 24 25 26 Clinical correlation remains another challenge. Higher EREFS scores are generally associated with more severe disease and fibrostenotic complications, but correlations with patient-reported symptoms such as dysphagia are inconsistent, likely due to the multifactorial nature of esophageal dysfunction [ 27 Our group recently proposed expanding the Eosinophilic Esophagitis Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) to include esophagitis as a sixth feature, based on evidence that it may represent an additional manifestation of EoE not captured by the original framework [ 26 3. Histopathologic Features The histological hallmark of EoE is the infiltration of the esophageal epithelium by eosinophils, which often aggregate beneath the surface epithelium and may form micro-abscesses ( Figure 2 Figure 3 2 26 27 To standardize and quantify these microscopic alterations, the EoE Histology Scoring System (EoEHSS) was developed [ 28 29 30 Evidence supporting EoEHSS primarily comes from retrospective or single-center cohorts in Western populations, limiting generalizability. Correlation between histologic scores and clinical symptoms is imperfect: some patients with high histologic severity may report minimal dysphagia, whereas others with low histologic scores experience significant symptoms [ 31 4. Differential Diagnosis of Esophageal Eosinophilia and EoE Mimickers Because esophageal eosinophilia (≥15 eosinophils/high-power field) is not pathognomonic, EoE remains a clinicopathologic diagnosis requiring both symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and exclusion of alternative causes of eosinophilia [ 28 29 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): GERD can produce low-grade, predominantly distal eosinophilia. Features favoring GERD include typical heartburn/regurgitation, Los Angeles–grade erosive esophagitis, and response to anti-reflux therapy [ 28 29 Infectious esophagitis (Candida, HSV, and CMV): Immunosuppressed patients with odynophagia, plaques, or ulcers may harbor infectious etiologies. Histology demonstrates organisms (GMS/PAS for fungi; viral cytopathic changes). Dense tissue eosinophilia is uncommon unless a secondary allergic component is present. Evidence mainly comes from case series, limiting generalizability [ 30 Drug-/pill-induced esophagitis: Acute mid-esophageal ulcers following ingestion of medications such as doxycycline, bisphosphonates, or NSAIDs may mimic EoE. Biopsies typically show mixed inflammation rather than dense eosinophilia [ 31 Non-EoE Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders (EGIDs): Multi-segment involvement with peripheral eosinophilia or elevated serum IgE suggests systemic EGID rather than isolated EoE [ 32 Systemic eosinophilic disorders (e.g., HES, EGPA): Marked peripheral eosinophilia and multi-organ involvement guide diagnosis, often supported by laboratory testing (AEC, FIP1L1-PDGFRA) [ 32 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Rare esophageal involvement occurs with aphthous or serpiginous ulcers and concomitant intestinal disease [ 30 Connective tissue and autoimmune disorders: Scleroderma, pemphigoid/pemphigus, lichen planus, and GVHD may mimic EoE. Clinical features, serology, and histology help differentiate, but reports are mostly small series [ 31 Structural/motility disorders: Dysphagia from achalasia or spastic disorders may overlap clinically. Manometry or EndoFLIP differentiates these from EoE; eosinophilia is usually absent or mild [ 31 33 Caustic or radiation injury; postsurgical strictures: Exposure history and endoscopic features (ulceration, necrosis, short smooth strictures) distinguish these from EoE [ 31 Malignancy: Progressive dysphagia with mass or ulceration requires targeted biopsy; dense eosinophilia is typically absent [ 31 Lymphocytic esophagitis: Can mimic EoE endoscopically, but histology shows peripapillary intraepithelial lymphocytosis with few eosinophils [ 30 31 Practical Clues Favoring EoE Evidence-based features supporting EoE over mimickers include: Clinical: Atopy, food impaction, seasonal symptom fluctuation, pediatric feeding dysfunction, or failure to thrive [ 28 29 34 Endoscopic: Multifocal EREFS features—edema, concentric rings, exudates, furrows, strictures—especially in the proximal/mid esophagus [ 28 Histologic: Peak eosinophil count ≥ 15 eos/hpf, microabscesses, surface layering, basal zone hyperplasia, and lamina propria fibrosis [ 1 28 29 Therapeutic response: Improvement with dietary elimination, topical steroids, or PPI is supportive but not specific; histologic confirmation on follow-up improves diagnostic certainty [ 28 29 Overall, the differential diagnosis of esophageal eosinophilia requires careful integration of clinical, endoscopic, and histologic data, with recognition of heterogeneity in study design, diagnostic criteria, and patient populations. 5. Diagnostic Criteria To increase the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis, international guidelines recommend taking at least six separate biopsy samples from the distal and mid-proximal esophagus to avoid overlooking the disease [ 1 Prolonged symptoms caused by a dysfunctional esophagus. Primary histologic criterion: Peak eosinophil density of ≥15 eosinophils per high-power field (≈60 eos/mm 2 ) , Exclusion of other causes of eosinophilic tissue infiltration, primarily GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease), connective tissue diseases, and Crohn’s disease. 6. Motility Assessment Tests 6.1. High-Resolution Manometry Long-standing transmural inflammation in EoE can alter esophageal motility and compliance [ 35 36 37 6.2. EndoFLIP Endoluminal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFLIP) is not a standard diagnostic tool for EoE but may help identify strictures and assess fibrostenotic burden. Nicodeme et al. [ 38 2 7. Management EoE is a chronic, progressive disorder requiring a lifelong management strategy aimed at preventing long-term complications. The therapeutic goals are to control symptoms, suppress esophageal inflammation, and preserve esophageal structure and function [ 39 Table 2 40 7.1. Dietary Treatment Dietary therapy remains the only approach that directly targets the causal trigger—food antigens driving mucosal inflammation. While capable of inducing clinical and histological remission, adherence and long-term sustainability remain key challenges. Elemental Diet: The landmark 1995 study by Kelly et al. [ 41 42 Empiric Elimination Diets (2-4-6 food): Empiric elimination of common food allergens (milk, wheat, egg, soy, nuts, seafood) achieves histologic remission in ~50–70% of patients [ 43 Allergy Test–Directed Diets: Diets guided by skin-prick or patch testing have lower and inconsistent efficacy (~30–45% remission), as predictive value of allergy testing for EoE triggers is limited [ 44 Overall, dietary therapy is effective but limited by adherence, nutritional risks, and quality-of-life impact. Long-term data are sparse, and global practice patterns differ markedly. 7.2. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Although EoE is immunologically distinct from GERD, PPIs demonstrate efficacy via both acid suppression and anti-inflammatory effects (reducing eotaxin-3 expression) [ 43 45 46 PPIs are widely used as first-line therapy in adults, typically initiated at high-dose twice daily for 8–12 weeks, with follow-up endoscopy to assess histological response. Tapering to the lowest effective maintenance dose is common in long-term management. Safety concerns—nutrient deficiencies, infections, kidney disease, and bone health—stem primarily from observational data in non-EoE populations [ 47 48 49 50 7.3. Topical Corticosteroids Corticosteroids (CS) possess anti-inflammatory properties, reduce esophageal constriction, and enhance the integrity of the esophageal barrier. Both systemic and topical steroids are effective in inducing histological remission in Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) patients across all age groups [ 51 51 52 53 Budesonide Orally Disintegrating Tablet (BOT, Jorveza): In phase III RCTs, Jorveza 1 mg twice daily induced histological and clinical remission in approximately 85–90% of patients at 12 weeks [ 54 n 55 Safety: The most frequent adverse effect is esophageal/oral candidiasis (~10–15%), typically mild and treatable [ 54 55 56 57 56 The evidence supporting these treatments is robust, based on multiple RCTs; however, most studies have been short-term (<1 year) and adult-focused. Pediatric data remain limited. 7.4. Biologic Therapy Biologics represent the newest frontier in EoE management. Anti-IL-5 agents (mepolizumab, reslizumab): Early randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated reductions in esophageal eosinophilia but no consistent clinical benefit, limiting their current role; trial designs were often small, heterogeneous, and predominantly focused on pediatric populations [ 57 58 Dupilumab (anti–IL-4Rα): This agent blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling—central to Th2-mediated inflammation. In phase III RCTs in adolescents and adults, weekly subcutaneous Dupilumab significantly improved dysphagia scores and reduced esophageal eosinophilia versus placebo [ 59 59 Regulatory approval and guidelines: Dupilumab is now approved in the US, Europe, and other regions as the first biologic for EoE [ 60 60 Overall, research on biologic therapies in EoE remains strong yet limited to a few agents and largely Western cohorts. Access and cost are significant global barriers. 7.5. Endoscopic Dilatation Endoscopic balloon dilatation addresses fibrostenotic complications such as strictures and rings. Symptomatic improvement occurs in approximately 75% of patients, often immediately, with durability up to 12 months [ 61 Complication rates are low (<1% perforation or bleeding) [ 62 8. Natural History In EoE, the course is relatively benign, often with mild dysphagia as the predominant symptom in most patients. About 30% to 50% of affected children report dysphagia symptoms beginning in adolescence, leading them to adapt their eating habits, such as avoiding certain foods (e.g., meat, crusty bread), increasing fluid intake during meals, and prolonging mastication before swallowing. As the disease progresses slowly, strictures in the esophagus typically appear about 10 years after symptom onset, affecting approximately half of patients [ 63 64 Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that even short-term pharmacological or dietary interventions can provide several months of symptom relief [ 64 65 65 63 64 Therefore, early and optimal treatment may slow disease progression; however, supporting data are limited, and few factors reliably predict the rate of progression to the fibrotic stage or the likelihood of esophageal stenosis [ 65 9. Conclusions Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, progressive disorder that has emerged as a significant clinical entity due to its increasing prevalence and recognition. Timely identification of affected individuals through comprehensive evaluation—including esophagogastroduodenoscopy with systematic, multi-segment biopsies—is essential for accurate diagnosis. Early and appropriate therapeutic interventions not only reduce esophageal eosinophilic inflammation but also play a critical role in preventing long-term sequelae, including fibrostenotic remodeling, strictures, and food impaction. These observations underscore the importance of heightened clinical vigilance, prompt diagnosis, and individualized management strategies to mitigate disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, further research is required to optimize long-term management, clarify the role of emerging biologic therapies, and identify reliable predictors of disease progression.

For each treatment, key advantages and limitations are listed based on efficacy, safety, and practicality. This table is intended to provide a concise overview for clinicians and researchers regarding the selection and expected outcomes of available therapies. Treatment Advantages Disadvantages  Dietary Treatment Targets underlying cause (food antigens); can achieve complete clinical and histologic remission; non-pharmacologic Difficult adherence, social/psychological burden, weight loss with elemental diets; multiple endoscopies required for stepwise elimination  Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) Widely available; effective in 30–50% of patients; addresses acid reflux and decreases eotaxin-3; safe in most patients Not effective in all; potential long-term risks (C. difficile, infections, nutrient deficiencies, kidney disease, osteoporosis); requires follow-up biopsies Topical Corticosteroids High histologic remission (~70–90%); minimal systemic absorption; multiple formulations available; effective maintenance therapy Local candidiasis (~10–15%), mild dysphonia, throat irritation, xerostomia; requires proper administration; long-term safety monitoring recommended Biologic Therapy Highly effective for moderate-to-severe/refractory EoE; improves atopic comorbidities; favorable safety profile; subcutaneous dosing Expensive; limited availability; injection-site reactions, URT infections, conjunctivitis; anti–IL-5 agents reduce Eosinophils but may not induce clinical remission  Endoscopic Dilatation Rapid relief of strictures; effective in ~75% of patients; low complication rate (<1%) Does not treat underlying inflammation; invasive; risk of perforation or bleeding; often requires repeat procedures ",
