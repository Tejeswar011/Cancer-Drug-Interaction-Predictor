Introduction Primary oral mucosal melanoma (OMM) is an extremely rare tumor, accounting for 1–2% of all malignant tumors of the oral cavity and less than 1% of all melanomas. Its incidence increases with age, and most patients are over 60 years old, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 5 5 6 7 Mucosal melanoma differs markedly from the more common cutaneous form. Clinically, mucosal lesions present late and lack the classic pigmented appearance, leading to delayed diagnosis and worse outcomes (often with 5-year survival under 20–25%). Biologically, these tumors exhibit low mutational burden with scarce BRAF (3–11%) mutations but more frequent KIT (22%) and NRAS (5–14%) aberrations, contrasting with the UV-driven mutation profiles seen in cutaneous melanoma [ 8 9 9 10 11 9 10 11 9 12 Surgical management is more challenging due to anatomical complexity, and therapeutic options—especially targeted or immunotherapies—are limited or less effective. Overall, mucosal melanoma is significantly more aggressive and carries a poorer prognosis than its cutaneous counterpart [ 13 14 15 About 80% of primary melanomas located in the oral cavity occur in the keratinized mucosa of the hard palate, then the mucosa of the maxilla and mandible and the buccal mucosa. Cases of melanoma of the tongue or bottom of the mouth [ 7 16 17 18 Amelanotic morphology accounts for approximately 10–25% of OMM cases and is associated with delayed diagnosis due to the absence of pigmentation [ 19 19 Several key prognostic factors are recognized in mucosal melanoma. Early-stage disease, thinner tumor thickness, and surgical resection are associated with improved overall survival [ 19 20 20 21 Metastases of melanoma to the oral cavity are rare, most commonly affecting the bones of the maxilla and mandible as well as the tongue, and their occurrence may indicate systemic spread of the disease [ 22 5 1 In about two-thirds of cases, metastases arise through the lymphatic route, while in the remaining cases they spread via the hematogenous route [ 13 The main treatment method for patients who develop mucosal melanoma is surgical treatment. Unfortunately, due to its sneaky evolution and late diagnosis at a usually advanced stage, the results of surgical treatment are not satisfactory. The purpose of this report is to present an atypical clinical presentation of oral melanoma. 2. Case Presentation In August 2024, a 99-year-old patient presented to the Department of Oral Surgery at the University Dental Center of the Medical University of Warsaw (WUM) with complaints of progressive gingival enlargement and recurrent bleeding during mastication localized in the regions of teeth 17–16 and 32–33. The patient was unable to determine the exact onset of these lesions and additionally reported inability to use dentures, which significantly impaired oral function. The patient’s oncological history was significant. Four years earlier, the patient had been diagnosed with nodular malignant melanoma of the abdominal skin. The lesion was excised with tumor-free margins (Breslow thickness 4.5 mm, mitotic rate 8/mm 2 On the day of presentation to the Department of Oral Surgery, extraoral examination revealed painless, enlarged left submandibular lymph nodes. Intraorally, tumor-like gingival proliferations were observed in the regions of teeth 17–16 (22 × 10 × 5 mm) ( Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 After oral hygiene treatment, under local anesthesia (articaine and norepinephrine 1:200,000 (40 mg + 0.005 mg) diagnostic excisional biopsies were performed. Both gingival lesions were excised with simultaneous extraction of adjacent teeth. Sharp bone edges were smoothed and the wounds sutured. Specimens were submitted for histopathological evaluation. At one-week follow-up, the sutures were removed ( Figure 1 Microscopic and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of multifocal oral mucosal melanoma (OMM): Maxillary lesion: infiltrating melanoma, mitotic index 14/mm 2 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Mandibular lesion: infiltrating melanoma, mitotic index 5/mm 2 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 Figure 10 Both specimens: non-brisk TILs, no satellite nodules, angioinvasion, or neuroinvasion. Immunohistochemistry: S100+, SOX10+, MelanA+, Ki67 high (80% positive in maxilla specimen, 70% positive in mandibular specimen); CK Pan−, LCA−. S100 and SOX10 staining demonstrated strong positivity in melanoma cells with negative reaction in adjacent epithelium. MelanA/MART1 also showed cytoplasmic positivity in tumor cells, whereas CKAE1/AE3 staining was negative in melanoma cells but positive in normal epithelium ( Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of multifocal oral mucosal melanoma (OMM). According to the AJCC classification of mucosal melanomas of the head and neck [ 8 9 10 Following histopathological confirmation, the patient was urgently referred to the Oncology Center. Two months later, a local recurrence was observed in the maxillary surgical scar. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 12 mm nodular thickening in the right upper gingiva, without evidence of lymphadenopathy, bone invasion, or distant metastases. Because of advanced age and high anesthetic risk, the patient declined further surgery and underwent radiotherapy VMAT-CBCT (Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy-Cone Beam Computed Tomography)—6 Gy/fraction, total dose 30 Gy. The treatment resulted in tumor regression. At three-month follow-up, no recurrence was detected. The patient remains under continuous oncological surveillance. 3. Discussion This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of oral mucosal melanoma (OMM), particularly its amelanotic variant, which commonly presents without characteristic pigmentation and may be mistaken for benign lesions. In our patient, the lesion’s smooth borders, lack of pigmentation, and atypical gingival location deviated from the more common palatal presentation, contributing to diagnostic delay [ 23 24 25 OMM is rare, accounting for 0.2–8% of all melanomas and <2% of oral malignancies [ 1 26 15 1 2 27 Oral mucosal melanoma develops asymptomatically but progresses rapidly. Early lesions are flat and small; later they become irregular, pigmented or amelanotic, and ulcerated. Symptoms may include bleeding, tooth mobility, and lymphadenopathy [ 2 28 29 Our case stands out in the field of OMM because of its synchronous, multifocal presentation, a rare phenomenon scarcely described in the recent literature. We interpret the oral lesions as synchronous multifocal primary OMM. Contiguous extension refers to the direct radial spread of a single neoplasm across anatomically adjacent mucosal surfaces, whereas multifocality denotes the presence of spatially distinct, histogenetically independent primary tumors. In mucosal melanoma of the head and neck, the occurrence of multiple foci lies within a diagnostic gray zone, as such lesions may reflect contiguous local progression, a mucosal field effect, or the emergence of de novo independent primaries. In the present case, the presence of well-demarcated, non-contiguous oral sites without intervening mucosal involvement most plausibly supports the designation of synchronous multifocal primaries. The amelanotic nature of the lesions significantly impedes clinical recognition, making histopathological examination and immunohistochemical profiling indispensable. Amelanotic OMM presents specific diagnostic challenges. Lack of pigmentation often leads to misdiagnoses and treatment delays. In a series of eight OAM (oral amelanotic melanomas), the majority presented as ulcerated masses, were located on gingiva or palate, and carried extremely poor prognoses; in fact, most patients succumbed within months of diagnosis [ 30 31 In the differential diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, pyogenic granuloma, fibrous hyperplasia, salivary gland tumors, lymphomas and metastasis should be considered. If the pigmentation of a lesion cannot be definitively diagnosed as benign based on clinical findings, a biopsy is mandatory to exclude OMM. Inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia (IFH) is a common reactive lesion of the oral mucosa. Clinically, it often presents as a well-defined exophytic mass with firm consistency and normal gingival coloration. On palpation, it may be either soft or hard. These atypical features necessitate heightened clinical suspicion, prompt diagnostic work-up, and tailored staging and management strategies, reinforcing that such rare presentations warrant special attention in both clinical practice and future research. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach was considered essential for the management of this patient. Following histopathological confirmation of multifocal amelanotic oral mucosal melanoma, the case was reviewed by the tumor board, including specialists in oral and maxillofacial surgery, oncology, radiology, radiation therapy, and pathology. The MDT discussion guided the decision to prioritize radiotherapy over surgery due to the patient’s advanced age, comorbidities, and high anesthetic risk. A structured follow-up schedule was established, with clinical and imaging evaluations at 3-month intervals to monitor for recurrence or metastasis, ensuring comprehensive surveillance despite the patient’s limitations. From a dental perspective, this case underscores the responsibility of dentists and oral surgeons to recognize and appropriately manage atypical oral lesions. Gingival overgrowths are frequently interpreted as inflammatory or reactive in origin; however, this report illustrates that persistent or unusual lesions warrant histopathological evaluation to rule out serious conditions such as OMM [ 25 26 Table 1 Histologically, amelanotic oral mucosal melanoma consists of spindle cells with numerous mitotic figures and no cytoplasmic melanin pigmentation. These malignant tumor cells are characterized by significant pleomorphism, with large, irregular, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli [ 18 17 32 2 2 33 34 Sometimes, satellite nodules may occur, i.e., nests of tumor cells separated from the main lesion. These are more common in cutaneous melanoma than in mucosal lesions, and their presence is associated with worse prognosis [ 22 14 32 2 Histopathological examination confirmed oral mucosal melanoma but does not determine whether the lesion is primary or metastatic. Traditional histopathologic features, such as junctional activity, are now considered unreliable because metastatic lesions may exhibit similar patterns. None of the examined samples showed an in situ or junctional component. Although no other primary melanoma was detected in our patient, confirming the origin (primary vs. metastatic) relies on molecular and genetic studies, which remain largely investigational and provide limited clinical guidance [ 5 17 25 Computed tomography (CT) with contrast is used to assess the primary tumor and cervical lymph nodes, and can also detect bone lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is employed to evaluate melanoma in soft tissues and is particularly useful for assessing the extent of tumors in the paranasal sinuses, especially those involving the skull base or demonstrating neurotropic spread. Tests for detecting distant metastases include brain MRI, chest CT, bone scintigraphy, and/or positron emission tomography (PET) [ 35 The 18F-FDG PET/CT protocol (positron emission tomography integrated with computed tomography using the glucose radioisotope fluorodeoxyglucose—FDG) has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in detecting metastases in soft tissues, lymph nodes, and internal organs both at initial assessment and during follow-up. It can also detect early tumor response during tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment [ 36 37 4 6 Table S1 34 38 1 27 In our patient, the BRAF V600 mutation was not detected, precluding targeted therapy. Testing for KIT, NRAS, and NF1 mutations, which could have been performed on paraffin-embedded tissue using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), was not undertaken due to the patient’s advanced age, poor general condition, low Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and personal preferences, which could represent contraindications to immunotherapy. This is particularly relevant in OMM, where mutation rates differ significantly from cutaneous melanoma; for instance, KIT mutations may occur in up to 25% of cases, while BRAF mutations are uncommon (<6%) [ 27 39 40 41 42 Despite these constraints, the case highlights the necessity of oncological vigilance in dental settings. It broadens awareness of OMM’s diverse clinical presentations and reinforces the importance of early biopsy in atypical cases [ 26 43 44 26 27 4. Conclusions Oral mucosal melanoma is a rare but aggressive malignancy that presents significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in its amelanotic form. Any atypical or proliferative oral lesion—especially in patients with a history of melanoma—should be biopsied to exclude recurrence or metastasis. Early diagnosis and radical excision remain crucial for improving outcomes, while lifelong surveillance is essential due to the high risk of recurrence. This case underscores the importance of oncological vigilance in dental practice and the need to include mucosal melanoma in the differential diagnosis of gingival and other oral lesions.

Step 1: Initial Clinical Assessment Assess lesion characteristics: color, size, shape, surface, symmetry, borders, growth rate  Identify symptoms: pain, bleeding, ulceration.  Review patient history: trauma, systemic disease, medications, previous malignancies. Step 2: Risk Stratification  Low-risk features: small, stable, uniform color, smooth surface, asymptomatic → monitor and document.  High-risk features: rapidly growing, irregular shape/borders, multiple colors, ulceration, bleeding, persistent > 2 weeks, previous melanoma → proceed to biopsy. Step 3: Basic Investigations  Intraoral photographs.  Radiographs if bone involvement suspected.  Consider initial lab tests if systemic disease suspected. Step 4: Biopsy Decision  Indicated for any high-risk lesion or atypical presentation.  Type of biopsy: excisional if small, incisional if large or anatomically challenging.  Ensure adequate margins for histopathological assessment. Step 5: Histopathological and Immunohistochemical Analysis  Standard H&E staining.  Immunohistochemistry: S100, SOX10, HMB45, Melan-A, Ki-67.  Molecular testing (KIT, NRAS, BRAF) if clinically relevant. Step 6: Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) Review  Pathologist, oral/maxillofacial surgeon, oncologist, radiotherapist.  Decide on definitive treatment and follow-up schedule. Step 7: Follow-Up  Clinical examination every 3–6 months.  Imaging (CT/MRI) as indicated.  Educate patient on self-monitoring for new lesions. ",
