However, the prevalence of modifiable risk factors has led to their increased diagnosis in younger people. Conventional treatment methods offer a wide range of drugs with different mechanisms of action, but their use brings only limited benefits. Often occurring, persistent adverse effects encourage the abandonment of regular drug administration and thus prevent effective therapy. Methods are sought that allow for targeted, more precise drug delivery that would eliminate their systemic and toxic effects. Therefore, one of the areas of particular interest in the field of cardiovascular diseases is the topic of drug delivery systems based on nanotechnology. We reviewed articles in the PubMed database focused on the latest reports of the use of nanotechnology in the treatment of CADs. Results: Nanoparticles (NCs) bring about many benefits compared to conventional preparations, which results from the possibility of carrying a larger amount of functional cargo and directing the therapy to individual cellular targets, as well as increasing the bioavailability of the transported drug. The introduction of NC to CAD treatment may allow for more effective therapy, but most importantly, it provides an opportunity for faster and more accurate diagnosis of developing disorders at a stage when they do not yet produce symptoms. Nanotechnology, thanks to the enormous variety of designed structures and functions, shows exceptional potential in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, its widespread implementation in clinical practice is a significant challenge. Further research is necessary to provide reliable data on the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and long-term safety of nanocarriers. The development of industrial methods for the production of nanocarriers with controlled and repeatable physicochemical properties while maintaining economic profitability remains a key challenge.

Introduction Cardiovascular diseases (CADs) are a significant problem that burden the healthcare system. According to the latest data (Eurostat), in 2021, 1.71 million deaths were recorded in Europe due to CADs, which constitutes 32.4% of all deaths and significantly exceeds the percentage of the second most common cause of death—cancer (malignant tumors: 21.6% of all deaths) [ 1 2 3 4 5 Currently, one of the areas of particular interest in the field of cardiovascular diseases is the topic of nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems. This innovative field of science deals with the development of particles with dimensions of 1–100 nm, composed of biomaterials (e.g., lipids, proteins), metals, or combinations of these materials. Additionally, the surface of nanoparticles (NC) can be modified with markers (peptides, polymers, antibodies) that enable the delivery of transported substances to specific tissue targets or even to a specific subcellular compartment. In this way, the accumulation and retention of the drug in the diseased site are increased, while the systemic toxicity is limited [ 6 Figure 1 7 2. Pathophysiology of Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries, commonly considered to be a disease primarily affecting the elderly. However, it is being diagnosed in younger people more frequently, which results from the increasing prevalence of risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, or a diet rich in highly processed foods, as well as from the progress made in the development of diagnostic methods for detecting early atherosclerotic changes [ 8 9 10 3. Perspectives and Possibilities of Using Nanomedicine in the Context of Cardiovascular Diseases Nanomedicine is defined as a branch of science dealing with the application of nanotechnology for the treatment, diagnostics, monitoring, and control of biological systems. It is based on the creation of nanoparticles—structures of 1–100 nm in size with a diverse chemical structure and physicochemical properties. The possibility of the precise control of NC formation processes allows for the adjustment of parameters such as shape, surface charge, or stability in the biological environment, enabling the prediction of NC behavior in vivo. Additionally, a high surface-to-volume ratio determines high load capacity, and the possibility of surface modification allows for the precise delivery of NC to selected structures and molecular targets. Improving the pharmacokinetics of drugs transported by NC allows for the effective use of substances with unfavorable properties—such as low solubility in water, poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, or serious side effects resulting from systemic and toxic effects [ 11 12 13 4. Nanotechnology in the Diagnosis of Cardiovascular Diseases 4.1. Detection of Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Diseases Early CAD diagnostics, especially in acute conditions (e.g., acute coronary syndromes in the form of myocardial ischemia), plays a key role in terms of effective treatment, improves prognosis, and prolongs survival. Currently, laboratory diagnostics are based on the detection of biomarkers of myocardial cell damage, which are released into the bloodstream during ischemia. The most frequently determined markers using mass spectrometry include cardiac troponins (cTns), myoglobin (Myo), creatinine kinase MB (CK-MB), and C-reactive protein. However, these classic detection methods are characterized by limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in determining very low concentrations of these markers in plasma, which can significantly delay diagnosis [ 14 Nanotechnology offers exciting possibilities for biosensor development but also presents several limitations. Key challenges include scalability, reproducibility, safety concerns, high costs, and ethical considerations. These factors impact the widespread adoption of nanobiosensors, particularly in real-world applications like disease diagnosis and environmental monitoring. The high cost of some nanomaterials, like graphene derivatives and noble metals, further hinders scalability. Achieving consistent performance and reliable results across different batches of nanobiosensors is crucial for their practical use, but this can be difficult to ensure. Some nanomaterials used in biosensors can be unstable in biological environments, affecting their sensitivity and detection limits ( Table 1 Nanotechnology offers numerous advantages across various fields due to its ability to manipulate materials at the atomic and molecular level. These advantages include enhanced material properties, improved energy production and storage, advancements in medicine, and more efficient manufacturing processes. Nanomaterials can be significantly stronger and more durable than their bulk counterparts. For example, carbon nanotubes and graphene can be used to create lighter, stronger, and more flexible materials. Nanomaterials have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, which makes them more effective catalysts for chemical reactions. This can be beneficial in various applications, including fuel production and chemical synthesis. Nanotechnology can be used to create more efficient electrical conductors, which can be used in electronics and energy storage. Nanomaterials can be designed with specific pore sizes, making them effective filters for water purification and other separation processes. Various nanoparticles, such as nanotubes, nanowires, or nanorods, provide a number of useful properties. The high payload of nanoparticles with a very sensitive reaction ensures ultra-low detection limits [ 15 Protein targets require prior recognition by specific detection molecules, which may be antibodies, aptamers, or polymers whose task is to selectively bind to antigens. The detection of bound molecules occurs using quantitative methods, including electrochemistry, electrochemiluminescence, fluorescence, and colorimetry, which can be much easier and more accurate due to the optical properties of nanomaterials. For example, the research team of Liyanage et al. designed and described the effectiveness of the first label-free biosensor based on a gold, triangular nanoprism (AuTNP) for the determination of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in human biological fluids (plasma, serum, urine). The results of the studies showed that this method allows for an attomolar (10 −18 16 17 In recent years, research has been underway on the use of other, alternative biomarkers to protein elements. New targets may be non-coding RNA molecules, especially microRNAs (such as miR-144a and miR-499), which play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes. In the work of Lan MI et al., a new detection platform based on metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) integrated with hemin was presented, enabling the ultrasensitive detection of microRNA (miRNA) using chemiluminescence (CL) in blood samples ( Figure 2 2 2 This platform enables the detection of miRNAs associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in human serum with a sensitivity of up to 1 fM and the ability to read the signal using a smartphone. In addition to a significant improvement in sensitivity, the advantages of this method include great simplicity, no need for advanced equipment, and ~50 times longer CL emission time compared to previous smartphone-based systems [ 18 4.2. Imaging Modality for Nanotechnology Used in CVD Nanotechnology revolutionizes CVD diagnostics by enhancing traditional imaging modalities like MRI, CT, and PET with nanoparticle-based contrast agents for greater sensitivity in detecting atherosclerotic plaques and vulnerable cardiac biomarkers. Emerging nano-based techniques, such as optical coherence tomography enhanced with nanoparticles and nanobubbles for targeted imaging, enable multimodal imaging and real-time tracking during therapy, creating a theranostic approach for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment. Enhanced Traditional Imaging Techniques ( Figure 3 18 19 4.2.1. Nanoparticles in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic resonance imaging is one of the key non-invasive imaging techniques used in many fields of medicine. Its great advantage is the ability to visualize abnormalities in the walls of blood vessels with atherosclerotic plaques and thrombi. There are two magnetic resonance angiography techniques: TOF (time of flight) angiography—in 2D or 3D—and phase contrast angiography—PC (phase contrast). Using high-resolution MR devices, it is possible not only to visualize the atherosclerotic plaque itself but also to determine the volume of the lipid core, the presence of hemorrhagic foci, and the thickness of the fibrous cover [ 19 Nanoparticles, due to their ultra-small size and the possibility of functionalizing their surface with specifically targeted structures, are currently an attractive research direction. Applying specific biomolecules to organic or inorganic NCs allows for methods to be significantly efficiency for localizing atherosclerotic plaques. However, this is not the only way to increase the accumulation of contrast agent in the lumen of damaged vessels. Platelets are involved in various stages of atherogenesis—they react to the inflammatory process in the vascular endothelium and participate in the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Zhang et al.’s group developed platelet membrane-coated nanoparticles (PNPs), containing lipid-chelated gadolinium (Gd), capable of targeting many biological elements important for the development of atherosclerotic plaque ( Figure 4 4.2.2. Nanoparticles in Radionuclide-Based Molecular Imaging Radionuclide-based molecular imaging is widely used to detect atherosclerotic lesions due to its high sensitivity, functional detection capability, and non-invasive nature. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows for 2–3 times higher spatial resolution compared to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and enables the detection of picomolar concentrations of nuclides. Initially, PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) was proposed as a non-invasive “gold standard” in identifying atherosclerotic plaques, which allows for the detection of inflammation in the vessel walls and identification of areas of macrophage accumulation [ 20 Radionuclide imaging, also known as nuclear medicine imaging, is a medical imaging technique that uses small amounts of radioactive substances (radionuclides) to diagnose and monitor various diseases. It works by detecting the radiation emitted by the tracer as it accumulates in specific tissues or organs. This allows doctors to visualize the function and structure of these areas, aiding in diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. Radionuclide safety focuses on minimizing radiation exposure from radioactive materials, adhering to the principles of time, distance, and shielding. These principles are crucial for protecting individuals working with or near radionuclides. The key aspects of radionuclide safety are time (limit the time spent near a radiation source), distance (maximize the distance from the radiation source, as radiation intensity decreases with distance), and shielding (use appropriate shielding materials (e.g., lead, concrete) to absorb radiation). Cancer is the major effect of concern from radionuclides. Radium, via oral exposure, is known to cause bone, head, and nasal passage tumors in humans, and radon, via inhalation exposure, causes lung cancer in humans. Uranium may cause lung cancer and tumors of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues. In order to overcome these limitations, the use of radiolabeled nanoparticles targeting molecular targets has been proposed. A potential biological target of NC may be chemokine receptors, some of which are specifically regulated in macrophages and play a key role in the development of atherosclerotic plaque. An example is the viral macrophage inflammatory protein-II (vMIP-II), targeting chemokine receptors, which was conjugated to a biocompatible, amphiphilic nanoparticle. After radiolabeling with the copper isotope 64Cu, biofunctional nanoparticles sensitively and specifically detected chemokine receptors in both the blood vessel damage model and the mouse atherosclerosis model [ 21 22 4.2.3. Nanoparticles in Optical Imaging Optical nanoparticles are most often used in the optical molecular imaging of neoplastic lesions, but in recent years, their use in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases has also been growing. This is due to the high spatial–temporal resolution and high sensitivity of optical methods compared to other imaging techniques. Optical techniques allow for the differentiation of pathological changes at the subcellular level, which allows for the assessment of different stages of atherosclerotic plaque progression. This is possible by directing optical nanoparticles to different molecular epitopes, which allows for the distinction of plaques susceptible to rupture from those that are stable [ 23 24 4.2.4. Nanoparticles in Multimodal Imaging Each of the individual imaging methods has its advantages but also numerous limitations ( Table 2 25 The first multimodal method was the combination of PET and MRI using multimodal nanoparticles. The combination of the high resolution provided by magnetic resonance with deep tissue penetration and the high sensitivity of PET made this method a valuable addition to the toolbox for detecting abnormalities in blood vessels [ 26 Dynamic development has made it possible to detect changes at a very early stage, which, in the future, may translate into faster treatment and the more effective prevention of complications related to cardiovascular diseases. However, introducing these advanced molecular imaging methods into everyday practice remains a big challenge. It requires a number of further in vivo studies to be performed that would allow for a precise assessment of the biocompatibility, pharmacokinetics, and, above all, safety of the nanomaterials used. Nanoparticles (NPs) offer benefits like advanced drug delivery, diagnostics, enhanced product performance (e.g., sunscreens), and environmental remediation, but they pose risks such as cellular damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, and organ deposition due to their small size and high surface area, which facilitate crossing biological barriers and interacting with cellular components. The exact toxicity depends on their unique physical and chemical properties, necessitating further research to fully understand their mechanisms of harm and develop effective mitigation strategies. 5. Nanoparticles in the Modern Treatment of Circulatory System Diseases Modern treatment for cardiovascular disease (CVD) involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medications (like statins, antiplatelets, and blood pressure regulators), innovative surgical and minimally invasive procedures (such as stents, angioplasty, bypass surgery, and valve replacements), and advanced technologies like wearable devices for monitoring and artificial intelligence (AI) for personalized care. So far, in everyday clinical practice, patients with circulatory system diseases have not been treated using nanoparticles. However, due to the great hopes associated with this technology, as well as the successes achieved with its use in oncology, it is expected that the process of incorporating NC into the treatment of cardiovascular diseases will be significantly accelerated. Further studies demonstrate the significant benefits of using nanomaterials, which, thanks to their properties, are able to significantly increase the chemical stability and improve the pharmacokinetic profile of transported pharmaceuticals, which makes them a particularly useful tool in therapy aimed at treating CADs. Nanoparticles are revolutionizing circulatory system treatment by acting as targeted delivery systems for drugs and imaging agents, enhancing the efficacy of therapies for conditions like atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and heart failure, and enabling advanced diagnostics through theranostic approaches. Their small size allows for improved solubility, controlled release, and site-specific delivery of various therapeutic agents, leading to better treatment outcomes with fewer side effects. Due to the greater ability of NC to accumulate in diseased areas, it is possible to use smaller doses of medicinal substances, which in turn translates into a reduction in their systemic toxic effects and a reduction in—or even elimination of—adverse effects [ 27 5.1. Nanotechnology in Inhibiting Inflammation in the Atherosclerotic Plaque Microenvironment Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process, during which the inflammatory cascade is activated and a number of cytokines are released, which are potential targets for cardiovascular disease therapy. One of the key cytokines of significant importance in this process is interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), which participates in both acute and chronic inflammatory responses. It has been proven that the level of IL-1β protein and mRNA in patients with atherosclerosis is significantly higher compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, a positive correlation has been demonstrated between the level of this cytokine and the stage of disease progression. It has also been shown that the variability in genes encoding IL-1β may be responsible for the inherited tendency to develop coronary artery disease [ 28 29 Figure 5 ROS play a dual role in CVD; at normal levels, they are essential for signaling, but excessive levels, known as oxidative stress, damage cellular components and promote the development and progression of heart and vascular diseases. ROS contribute to atherosclerosis by oxidizing LDL, lead to ischemia–reperfusion injury through mitochondrial damage, and cause cardiac remodeling and arrhythmias by affecting calcium handling and inducing apoptosis in heart cells. ROS uptake protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis and promotes macrophage transformation towards a regenerative M2 phenotype. Additionally, selectively reacting hydrogels facilitate precise drug release at the site of damage, allowing for achieving local therapeutic concentrations while minimizing side effects. In turn, the use of IL-1β-VHH nanoprotein inhibits the inflammatory cascade at the site of damaged heart tissue. Studies conducted in an animal model have shown that this complex therapeutic strategy not only inhibits inflammation but also supports cardiomyocyte regeneration, which confirms its potential in the treatment of myocardial infarction [ 30 5.2. Nanocarriers Transport Nanoparticles transport conventional drugs by encapsulating them to improve solubility, stability, and targeted delivery to specific cells or tissues, thereby reducing side effects and increasing therapeutic efficacy. These nanocarriers overcome biological barriers, facilitate controlled drug release over time, and offer advantages like sustained action and reduced dosage needs. Various types of nanoparticles, including polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles, and magnetic nanoparticles, are used depending on the drug and target, demonstrating their growing importance in revolutionizing drug delivery systems for diseases. Statins are small-molecule drugs that are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, commonly used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Although their efficacy in primary and secondary prevention has been well documented, chronic systemic use may lead to adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity or rhabdomyolysis. Intolerance to statins, leading to the discontinuation of therapy or non-adherence to recommendations, significantly reduces their clinical effectiveness [ 31 32 Cholesterol is the main component of atherosclerotic plaques and, together with macrophages, is largely responsible for the inflammation occurring within them. The effectiveness of statins and other antiatherosclerotic drugs is limited due to their low affinity for cholesterol molecules. To overcome this problem, charge-switchable nanoparticles (CSNPs) were designed, the structure of which allows for the selective binding of cholesterol and release of the drug precisely in the microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque. CSNPs contain cyclodextrin and simvastatin, enclosed in a phospholipid shell. Cyclodextrin, due to its ability to form complexes with hydrophobic molecules, has a high affinity for cholesterol, but its systemic use in high doses in animals caused serious adverse effects, such as hearing loss due to damage to hair cells in the hearing apparatus. Studies in a mouse model of atherosclerosis have shown that systemically administered CSNPs effectively target atherosclerotic plaques, allowing for the preferential accumulation of the drug within the lesion while eliminating the side effects caused by free-form cyclodextrin. This allows for a synergistic effect resulting from the therapeutic action of simvastatin and targeting with cyclodextrin [ 33 34 35 36 5.3. The Interaction Between Nanoparticles and Immune System Nanoparticles escape the immune response primarily by employing surface coatings like polyethylene glycol (PEG) to become “stealthy” or by mimicking host cell components, thus delaying opsonization (marking for destruction) and phagocytosis by immune cells like macrophages. Other strategies include using natural cell membranes to cloak nanoparticles, hitchhiking on circulating immune cells to avoid detection, or engineering nanoparticles that actively suppress immune responses rather than trigger them. The goal is to extend their circulation time in the bloodstream and reach their intended targets, such as tumors, without being prematurely cleared by the immune system. Despite their high biocompatibility, nanoparticles are recognized by immune system cells as foreign structures, which leads to their capture and destruction. Therefore, it has become necessary to develop strategies to avoid the reaction of the host’s immune system. One of the solutions being studied is the use of biomimetic coatings, i.e., membranes that replicate natural cell membranes—for example, macrophage or platelet membranes, as mentioned earlier. This approach allows for the “masking” of NCs and increases their ability to circulate in the blood for a long time [ 37 38 5.4. Nanotechnology in Vascular Treatment Nanotechnology significantly advances vascular treatment by enabling highly targeted diagnostic imaging, improving drug delivery to specific lesion sites, and creating new therapeutic strategies for conditions like atherosclerosis, vascular anomalies, and restenosis. Nanoparticles can carry drugs to reduce plaque, deliver contrast agents for enhanced imaging (MRI, CT), and facilitate tissue repair via nanostructured scaffolds, ultimately improving treatment efficacy and minimizing side effects. Understanding the molecular processes leading to the development of atherosclerosis has allowed for the development of new chemical substances (inhibitors/agonists) targeting individual stages of this process. It has long been known that monocytes and macrophages play a key role in the progression of atherosclerotic changes. They are responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory cells, the accumulation of macrophages, and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which drives the chronic inflammation in the blood vessel wall. Additionally, it has been proven that the accumulation of macrophages itself is directly related to the destabilization of the plaque and the increased risk of its rupture. Therefore, a promising therapeutic strategy may be the use of inhibitors that weaken the activity of monocytes and macrophages. One of the key mechanisms regulating the process of their recruitment and differentiation is T lymphocyte signaling through the interaction of CD40 ligand with CD40L and the activation of TRAF family proteins, in particular TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor type 6). Initially, attempts were made to use inhibitors blocking the CD40 receptor itself. However, it has been shown that long-term inhibition of this molecule—although effective in terms of antiatherosclerotic activity—leads to undesirable immunosuppression and an increased risk of thromboembolism. This is due to the disruption of signaling by other TRAF family proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5, which are important for producing a proper immune response. Therefore, selective inhibitors blocking the interaction between the CD40 molecule and the TRAF6 factor (TRAF-STOP) have been developed, which do not interfere with the processes conditioned by CD40-TRAF2/3/5, and therefore do not affect CD40-conditioned immunity ( Figure 6 39 Studies have shown that TRAF6i-HDL nanoparticles are selectively taken up by monocytes and macrophages, but they are not internalized by lymphocytes. This led to a decrease in CD40 expression and inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment, which resulted in the regression of atherosclerotic lesions. Additionally, TRAF-STOP treatment did not disrupt the “classical” immune pathways conditioned by CD40, which confirmed the safety of this therapy [ 40 41 42 43 44 45 Fluorescent payload—indocyanine green (ICG) dye; SIRT1 activator—SRT1720; Modified peptide molecules targeting osteopontin (OPN). Diallyl trisulfide (DATS) is a compound capable of generating hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in a controlled and gradual manner through reaction with reduced endogenous glutathione (GSH) [ 46 47 5.5. Nucleic Acid Transporting Nanoparticles 5.5.1. siRNA-Based Therapies Due to the overexpression of osteopontin in activated VSMCs with an inflammatory phenotype, nanoparticles specifically accumulated within atherosclerotic plaques after their intravenous introduction in an animal model. The effective delivery of the SIRT1 activator had a beneficial effect on the morphology of sensitive plaques, which was mainly due to the inhibition of the phenotypic change in smooth muscle cells—one of the key factors of atherosclerotic progression. After two weeks of therapy, an improvement in the size and composition of the plaques was noted, which suggests the increased efficacy of SRT1720 delivered in the nanoparticle form compared to the free form. These results indicate that theragnostic nanoparticles designed in this way have great potential for the simultaneous identification and targeted treatment of unstable atherosclerotic lesions [ 48 49 50 51 2 52 2 2 53 Gene therapy is currently a rapidly developing therapeutic strategy that shows great potential in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. One of the promising methods is the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for therapy, which are double-stranded RNA molecules capable of selectively silencing the expression of genes with a homologous sequence, thus enabling the inhibition of the production of a specific protein [ 54 55 56 57 58 59 Figure 7 The applied treatment reduced leukocyte recruitment and inflammation within the atherosclerotic plaque in a mouse model of atherosclerosis and after myocardial infarction. Additionally, the reduced infiltration of immune cells into acutely ischemic myocardium improved cardiac tissue regeneration and reduced the area of damage. These studies suggest the possibility of the effective, parallel targeting of multiple genes as a therapeutic route to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis and prevent complications after ischemic myocardial injury [ 60 61 2+ 62 63 64 5.5.2. miRNA-Based Therapies Among the RNA molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs) also find their place in medicine. miRNAs are non-coding, single-stranded RNA molecules capable of regulating the expression of other genes; for example, by inhibiting their translation or degrading target mRNAs [ 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 6. Nanocarriers with Therapeutic Properties Designed nanoparticles are used for the targeted and thus more effective delivery of various therapeutic agents to the atherosclerotic plaque environment. However, in recent years, attention has been paid to the possibility of creating nanocarriers that could exhibit therapeutic activity themselves. Considering the key role played by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, nanomaterials with intrinsic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity may be a promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases [ 72 2 73 74 In recent years, there has been increased interest in the possibility of using nanotechnology in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The principle of PDT is based on three components: photosensitizer, light, and molecular oxygen. The exposure of photosensitive compounds to a specific type of light catalyzes the formation of singlet oxygen, which exerts a cytotoxic effect on diseased cells. Currently, the use of PDT is mainly focused on superficial changes, especially cancerous ones, which results from limitations related to the delivery of photosensitizers to diseased sites (low solubility, lack of selectivity) and the depth of light penetration into tissues. In response to these limitations, new photosensitizer nanocarriers have been developed, which increase the effectiveness of the PDT method through better accumulation in target tissues [ 75 76 77 78 2+ 2+ Figure 8 In an in vivo model, the use of the CuS-TRPV1 conjugate enabled the high-resolution, photoacoustic imaging of coronary vessels and significantly reduced lipid accumulation and atherosclerotic plaque development in mice. These results confirm the potential of this strategy as a precise and controlled therapy modulating TRPV1 signaling pathways in the treatment of atherosclerosis [ 79 7. Conclusions Nanotechnology, due to the enormous diversity of designed structures and functions, shows exceptional potential in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The use of nanoparticles enables the development of highly sensitive and precise biosensors, significantly reducing the diagnostic time. Compared to conventional imaging methods, targeted nanocarriers can selectively accumulate within atherosclerotic plaques, increasing the sensitivity and accuracy of detecting pathological changes. In CVD therapy, nanotechnology enables the implementation of various treatment strategies, including the repair of damaged endothelium, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effects, or the inhibition of platelet aggregation. Most often, NCs act as multifunctional drug carriers, increasing their bioavailability, protecting against degradation, and enabling targeted delivery of therapeutics to the microenvironment of atherosclerotic plaque. In recent years, attention has also been paid to the natural therapeutic properties of some nanomaterials, such as the ability to neutralize ROS and photothermal or photodynamic effects, which additionally expand their application. Despite numerous benefits, the widespread implementation of nanotechnology in clinical practice still faces significant challenges. Further, well-designed preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to provide reliable data on the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and long-term safety of nanocarriers. It is also necessary to understand the interactions of NCs with other therapeutic compounds and elements of the biological environment. A key challenge also remains the development of industrial methods for the production of nanocarriers with controlled and repeatable physicochemical properties while maintaining economic profitability. Fulfilling these conditions is a necessary condition for introducing nanotechnology as a standard method in modern cardiovascular medicine.
