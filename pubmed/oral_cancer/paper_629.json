Prevention of HCC is a major challenge, as the association between viral suppression and HCC risk reduction is multifactorial, involving the progressive depletion of hepatocytes through covalently closed circular DNA integration, as well as the prevention of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Despite effective and cheap antiviral treatment capable of suppressing HBV replication and thereby cirrhosis and HCC, the current indications for therapy need revision and more research to expand the gamut and treat more infected people. In this review, we discuss the possible expansion of antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis B to prevent cirrhosis and, importantly, HCC.

For every 100 persons living with HBV, without treatment, cirrhosis will be seen in one-fourth and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in ≤ 5 people[ 1 2 3 Even though potent, effective, and affordable antiviral treatments for HBV are available to suppress the virus and lower the risk of HCC and cirrhosis, current therapy indications overlook a specific subset of patients at risk for developing cirrhosis and HCC. In this review, we discuss the potential expansion of antiviral treatment in CHB to prevent cirrhosis and, importantly, HCC. EXISTING HBV GUIDELINES: ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT The management of “blood-borne viruses” is rapidly changing. Newer biotechnologies for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and novel drugs for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) have raised the hope of containing the HIV and HCV epidemics by 2030[ 4 5 Similar targets for HBV have underscored the need to improve screening, expand treatment, and childhood vaccination to prevent the inter- and intra-generational transmission of the virus. Sero-discordance is classically used in the context of HIV to describe a relationship between two people with opposite viral statuses, with the recognition of enhanced risk to the seronegative partner. HBV has not used this, but the rationale remains the same. Among an estimated 254 million people infected with HBV worldwide, more than 800000 perish[ 6 7 Clinical practice guidelines have been published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)[ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF HBV GUIDELINES The current standard for developing guidelines for practice is that the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group bases recommendations on the quality of evidence[ 15 AASLD issued the guidelines in 2016 following a GRADE-based recommendation on nine questions that physicians routinely encounter[ 8 9 The WHO guidelines were created using the GRADE framework and standards[ 14 13 11 10 12 NATURAL HISTORY OF CHB CHB is a lifelong infection, mostly acquired perinatally or in early childhood.

High HbsAg and DNA levels with HBeAg +ve are Phase 1 [the immune-tolerant (IT) phase] features. The inflammatory activity is assumed to be absent despite the ongoing replication, and the histological activity is expected to be minimal or normal. ALT levels may not indicate inflammatory activity, and several studies have shown a poor correlation between ALT and inflammation[ 16 18 The guidelines also differ in defining expected HBV DNA values in the IT phase. The DNA criteria (> 10 7 13 10 6 11 6 8 13 10 Hence, the definition of the IT phase continues to be defined and improved upon, and the consensus regarding ALT and DNA values has still not been reached. There is a relative consensus between the definitions and interpretations of the other three phases (Phases 2, 3, and 4) in the guidelines. ASSESSMENT OF HBV INFECTION (IT PHASE) All the existing guidelines have similar recommendations for the assessment of HBV infection, but APASL[ 11 11 via 11 APASL[ 11 APASL[ 11 13 CURRENT INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT OF CHB Most of the guidelines are in unison for Phase 2 or Phase 4; however, there are subtle differences in the management strategies of the other phases (Phase 1 and Phase 3) of chronic HBV infection (Tables 2 3 4 5 Table 2 Management of phases of chronic hepatitis B virus infection   APASL[ 11  EASL[ 10  AASLD[ 8 9  INASL[ 12  KASL[ 13 Monitor if High DNA (> 2 × 10 6 High DNA (> 10 6 High DNA (> 10 6 High DNA (> 10 6 High DNA (≥ 10 7 Biopsy if (1) > F2 fibrosis; (2) ALT > ULN; (3) > 35 years; and (4) Family history of cirrhosis/HCC (1) > F2 fibrosis; (2) ALT > ULN; and (3) ≥ 30-40 years Treat if Biopsy shows significant inflammation or fibrosis Biopsy shows significant inflammation or fibrosis Extra-hepatic manifestation or, family history of cirrhosis with DNA > 2000 IU/mL Biopsy shows significant inflammation or fibrosis May treat if (1) > 30 years with a family history of cirrhosis/HCC; and (2) Extra-hepatic manifestation > 40 years and HBV DNA (> 10 6 > 30 years APASL: Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver; EASL: European Association for the Study of the Liver; AASLD: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases; INASL: Indian National Association for Study of the Liver; KASL: Korean Association for the Study of the Liver; HBV: Hepatitis B virus; ULN: Upper limit of normal; ALT: Alanine aminotransferase; HCC: Hepatocellular cancer.

Almost all societies recommend initiation of treatment if the biopsy shows significant inflammation (> A2) or fibrosis (> F2), but only APASL[ 11 13 INASL[ 12 10 12 8 12 10 Patients in Phase 3 of infection (inactive CHB) usually do not require any therapy and should be monitored closely for transition to Phase 4. However, APASL[ 11 10 10 HCC SURVEILLANCE IN CHB HCC can develop in all stages of HBV infection, and the risk is variable as it is predominantly determined by the patient’s immune response to the infection. Active viral replication and cirrhosis increase the risk of HCC[ 19 In untreated patients, the cumulative incidence varies from 8% to 20%, with the annual risk between 2% and 5%[ 20 21 22 Despite therapy, HCC remains a major concern for patients with CHB, although the risk is substantially reduced[ 23 24 25 20 26 27 All guidelines recommend sustained monitoring of patients for the risk of disease progression and development of HCC, with those on treatment being especially monitored for therapy response and adherence. If the patient develops cirrhosis before loss of HBsAg, they remain at risk for HCC and should continue on surveillance. Even in the absence of cirrhosis, HCC may still develop after spontaneous HBsAg loss[ 28 6 Table 6 Hepatocellular cancer surveillance in chronic hepatitis B   APASL[ 11  EASL[ 10  AASLD[ 8 9  INASL[ 10  KASL[ 13  WHO[ 14 Threshold incidence of HCC to determine the intensity of screening Determined individually based on the economic situation of each country Not defined Surveillance only if the incidence is greater than 0.2% Not defined Not defined Surveillance only if incidence greater than 0.2% Use of risk scores for HCC prediction Recommended Recommended Recommended Recommends specifically the CU-HCC score Recommended Recommended Mode of surveillance USG abdomen.

It is also worth noting that guidelines do vary regarding some specifics. For risk stratification, almost all guidelines recommend multiple risk scores; however, INASL specifically recommends the CU-HCC scores given their simplicity. Similarly, all guidelines mention the concurrent use of ultrasound and AFP during the surveillance program, but INASL only recommends an ultrasound with no added benefit of measuring AFP. There is a slight discordance amongst the guidelines in the use of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) during the surveillance. Whereas all guidelines recommend the use of CECT in evaluating a suspicious lesion, APASL[ 11 11 11 ADVANCES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AND EMERGING DATA IN HBV As discussed earlier, the main goals in managing CHB include improving liver histology, achieving viral suppression, normalizing ALT levels, and preventing complications such as cirrhosis, liver disease decompensation, and HCC. HBeAg-positive CHB patients are categorized into two main groups: Those with chronic infection (previously called \"immune tolerant\" or IT) and those with chronic hepatitis (previously called \"immune active\" or IA, HBeAg-positive). The chronic hepatitis group typically shows abnormal liver histology (indicating ongoing liver damage) and generally has somewhat lower HBV DNA levels when compared to patients in the chronic infection phase. Conventionally, the chronic infection (or \"immune-tolerant\") phase has been understood as a period marked by high HBV DNA levels and a minimal immune response against the virus. This often results in normal or only mildly elevated ALT levels, which is a liver enzyme that can indicate liver inflammation[ 29 30 31 CHB (HBeAg negative) accounts for the majority of hepatitis B infections. The main motive in treating these patients is to achieve either a resolved HBV infection or spontaneous resolution of the infection[ 32 4 6 32 Despite these recommendations, a critical objective of HBV treatment—HCC prevention—is often overlooked in patients who are in the \"IT\" phase. Figure 1 Figure 1  The natural history of hepatitis B virus presents certain challenges related to clinical management and treatment. MANAGEMENT PITFALLS IN EXISTING HBV GUIDELINES Due to the risk of progression from the IT to IA phase, APASL and EASL have reduced the recommended age limit for starting treatment to over 35 and 30 years, respectively. There are expectations that AASLD may follow APASL and EASL[ 8 10 11 During the chronic hepatitis phase, the ALT levels may fluctuate and show a modest correlation with histologic changes of necroinflammation, creating the risk of sampling errors. This is particularly relevant for IT/IA patients, who may be assessed when ALT levels are at a nadir rather than at peak (Table 1 33 32 34 Interpreting serum HBV DNA levels is also challenging, as there is no clear cut-off for determining treatment eligibility or response. The 2000 National Institutes of Health conference arbitrarily set a threshold of 20000 IU/mL (> 105 copies/mL), but DNA levels fluctuate, making consistent monitoring essential[ 35 After HBV infection, over 95% of adults with normal immune function can spontaneously clear the virus, with only a small percentage progressing to chronic infection[ 36 37 A study involving 253 chronic HBV patients who presented with normal ALT levels revealed a notable association between age and the prevalence of significant liver fibrosis. Specifically, 42% of patients over the age of 40 were found to have significant liver fibrosis. This was a higher proportion compared to 30% of patients under 40 years old in the same study cohort[ 38 39 40 41 Expert opinions from AASLD, Sweden, Taiwan, and East Asia all recommend initiating antiviral treatment for patients in the IT phase once they reach 40 years of age[ 8 42 44 11 45 10 12 46 Current guidelines rely on surrogate markers, such as ALT normalization to indicate the cessation of necroinflammation, and HBV DNA clearance to suggest viral inactivity. Noninvasive tests for liver fibrosis, like Fibroscan, are useful but limited, and liver biopsies are only employed when these tests yield unclear results. Consequently, many individuals eligible for treatment may be missed, leaving them at risk of complications and ongoing transmission (Figure 1 RISK OF HCC IN IT PHASE The main obstacle in HBV treatment advancement is the lack of techniques to measure cccDNA directly, as HBeAg, ALT, and HBV DNA levels do not provide any information on cccDNA or HBV genome integration. The REVEAL study from Taiwan demonstrated a strong connection between high HBV DNA and HCC incidence. Among 23820 participants, 4155 were HBsAg-positive, with complete data available for 3653 patients, 94% of whom had ALT levels less than 45 IU/L. Those with consistently high levels of HBV DNA (> 100000 copies/mL) at two time points had the maximum risk of HCC [hazard ratio (HR) = 5.3 95%CI: 2.9-9.7], while those with low HBV DNA levels at all time points had the lowest risk (HR = 1.3 95%CI: 0.5-3.1) over 10.7 years follow up. Importantly, this relationship between HBV DNA and HCC was not dependent on alcohol use, smoking, HBeAg status, ALT level, or cirrhosis. Patients with spontaneous clearance of high HBV DNA levels had an intermediate risk for HCC (HR = 1.9 95%CI: 0.8-4.4) over 11.1 years[ 47 In another study, Kim et al 48 P 48 P 48 The ALT levels, commonly used as a marker, do not reliably correlate with liver necroinflammation, HBV mutations, or integration of the HBV genome into hepatocyte DNA[ 49 50 Current guidelines use surrogate markers like normalization of ALT and HBeAg seroconversion as measures of outcome, potentially leaving a significant portion of the IT (at-risk) population untreated. These individuals can continue transmitting the virus and are more likely to develop HCC, especially if they do not adhere to long-term monitoring, including repeated testing, liver biopsies, and follow-ups lasting years or decades[ 51 UNDERSTANDING INDETERMINATE PHASE IN CHB IT and indeterminate phase Definitions of the IT phase vary globally based on HBV DNA thresholds: > 2 × 10 7 52 7 10 6 8 4 11 8 Key mechanisms underlying immune tolerance include: (1) Persistent cccDNA: HBV cccDNA within hepatocyte nuclei remains stable, complicating complete viral clearance despite antiviral therapy[ 53 54 55 56 11 57 58 HLA e.g. HLA-DPA1 HLA-DPB 59 60 Some researchers suggest renaming this phase \"high replication, low inflammation\" due to its minimal immune response, although the \"immune-tolerant phase\" remains widely used[ 61 62 IA and indeterminate phase CHB progression is not always sequential. Adolescents or adults may bypass immune tolerance, while perinatally infected individuals often have prolonged IT phases[ 52 62 8 10 Indeterminate CHB patients in this phase typically exhibit HBeAg and HBsAg positivity, HBV DNA levels between 2 × 10 2 4 9 Immune-inactive and indeterminate phase Previously termed the \"inactive carrier phase\"[ 8 63 10 8 3 3 9 Immune reactivation and indeterminate phase Spontaneous or post-treatment reactivation, termed HBeAg-negative CHB[ 9 8 10 64 65 Indeterminate CHB cases in this phase exhibit: ALT ≥ 2 times ULN with HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL, or ALT < 2 times ULN with HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/mL[ 9 The various pros and cons of treating this difficult group of patients have been mentioned in Table 7 Table 7 Management of indeterminate chronic hepatitis B patients: Immune-tolerant and Immune-active  Phase  Pros of treatment  Cons of treatment IT  Early viral suppression: 47 48  Limited immediate benefit: 48 82  Prevention of carcinogenesis: 47 High cost and long duration: 11 45  Reduced Transmission: 45  Treatment resistance: 11 45  Advances in understanding IT phase: 57  Risk of side effects: 45 47 IA  Proven effectiveness: 45 48  Side effects: 11 45  Improved liver function: 45 47  Monitoring required: 11 82  Reduced mortality: 45 47  Cost: 11 45  Reduced complications: 45 47  Possible drug resistance: 45 82 CHB: Chronic hepatitis B; IT: Immune-tolerant; IA: Immune-active; HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma. CHRONIC HBV INFECTION: EXPANDING TREATMENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA While universal immunization can substantially lower the rate of new infections, effectively tackling the significant burden of horizontal transmission necessitates broader access to antiviral therapy. Exceptions have already been made for certain groups, such as individuals under 30, those at risk of mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, family members of patients with HCC, medical personnel, and individuals on immunosuppression or chemotherapy[ 8 10 11 8 66 Table 8 Pros and cons of expanded hepatitis B treatment in different regions of the world  Region/Country  Pros of expanded HBV treatment  Cons of expanded HBV treatment  Ref.

Could reduce complications related to liver disease Limited diagnostic infrastructure in rural regions. Cultural and religious beliefs may affect treatment adherence. Healthcare costs are a significant burden on government budgets [ 93 HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma; HBV: Hepatitis B virus. To support the goal of eliminating CHB, revising treatment guidelines to expand eligibility for therapy is crucial. Current evidence does not allow clear differentiation between the true IT phase of CHB and minimally inflamed IT CHB with normal ALT levels. An invasive biopsy is not recommended for all patients with IT CHB. As the risk of carcinogenesis is well-established for HBV DNA levels exceeding 100000 copies/mL (approximately 2000 IU/mL)[ 67 34 47 NEED FOR ADOPTION OF NEW HBV BIOMARKERS Follow-up and adherence are essential even in patients on NA therapy, as they help in preventing complications. Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is considered a more reliable surrogate marker for cccDNA activity than quantitative HBsAg levels. HBV RNA is another promising biomarker, as it reflects intrahepatic cccDNA transcription and typically declines before HBeAg seroconversion[ 68 69 Therefore, risk stratification for hepatocarcinogenesis in CHB should be revised to incorporate novel biomarkers such as HBcrAg and HBV RNA, which can help differentiate true viral resolution from mere suppression achieved through antiviral therapy. This is particularly relevant in the IT phase, where elevated levels of HBcrAg or HBV RNA suggest ongoing cccDNA activity and a continued risk of HCC, despite normal ALT levels. Current clinical practice often overlooks key histological subgroups—such as those with minimal inflammation, significant HBV genome integration, or high viral loads—that may still carry a substantial risk for HCC[ 69 Measurement of HBcrAg and HBV RNA holds promise for validating cccDNA activity and assessing HCC risk, particularly in patients who are currently considered ineligible for antiviral therapy. Additionally, the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and alcohol use complicates the interpretation of elevated transaminase levels, potentially obscuring underlying HBV activity. This is especially significant given the inverse relationship between hepatic steatosis and HBV-related disease activity, alongside the heightened risk of hepatocarcinogenesis in individuals with concurrent HBV and NAFLD[ 70 COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF EXPANDED HBV TREATMENT IN HIGH AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES To drive the global elimination of HBV, expanding testing and treatment services in resource-limited regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, is essential. However, existing international HBV treatment guidelines involve complex eligibility criteria that rely on diagnostic tests often unavailable in these low-resource settings. Consequently, simplifying the criteria, with a \"Treat All\" strategy being the most comprehensive option, could offer a practical solution. Despite its potential advantages, such an approach could have considerable economic consequences, especially in a resource-constrained environment (Table 9 Table 9 Cost-effectiveness of expanded hepatitis B virus treatment in high and low-income countries  Ref.

A comprehensive literature review reveals four relevant studies, three examining the cost-effectiveness of a \"Treat All\" strategy and one evaluating simplified treatment eligibility criteria. Razavi-Shearer and colleagues[ 71 72 et al 73 74 Nguyen et al 75 CONTRARIAN VIEWPOINT ON TREATMENT EXPANSION IN HBV The recommendation to extend antiviral therapy to highly replicative phases of CHB, such as the HBeAg-positive, high-DNA IT phase, has encountered considerable resistance. Moreover, current NA therapies result in a very low likelihood of inducing HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss in the IT phase. Chan et al 76 77 The inactive carrier phase is characterized by the absence of HBeAg, consistently normal ALT levels, and low HBV DNA levels (< 2000 IU/mL). Although this phase generally has a more favorable clinical outlook, in a meta-analysis by Raffetti et al 78 77 78 Emerging evidence suggests that a significant portion of CHB patients do not fit neatly into any of the established phases and are therefore classified as being in the indeterminate phase. Current practice guidelines do not recommend antiviral therapy for CHB in this phase[ 9 11 et al 79 79 80 81 One of the primary challenges in managing HBV at the population level is the lack of a curative therapy, which means that sustained viral suppression often requires long-term, and sometimes lifelong, antiviral treatment. A significant concern is the potential emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants due to extensive use of NA therapy, which can lead to progressive liver fibrosis and decompensation[ 51 81 93 OCCULT HBV INFECTION: TO TREAT OR NOT? Replicable HBV DNA in the liver, even when an individual tests negative for HBsAg in their blood, is called occult HBV infection (OBI). This can occur with or without detectable HBV DNA in the bloodstream. In this particular subset of patients, HBV DNA has reduced replication potential and exists as cccDNA. As a result, the HBV DNA in serum/plasma is often intermittently detected and at a low level of viremia (< 200 IU/mL). OBI can be further subclassified into seropositive and seronegative HBV. Seropositive OBI, which represents approximately 80% of all OBI cases, is typically marked by the presence of anti-HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs) and/or anti-HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) antibodies. Seropositive OBI, which accounts for around 80% of all infections, characteristically has detectable anti-HBs antibodies or anti-HBc antibodies. Seronegative OBI, on the other hand, tests negative for anti-HBc and anti-HBs but has intrahepatic HBV DNA[ 94 36 95 96 97 99 Moreover, the coexistence of OBI along with other etiologies may exacerbate the progression of underlying liver disease to advanced stages, in addition to the risk of the development of HCC. In clinical practice, it is pertinent to differentiate OBI from ‘S-S-escape mutant infection’ wherein serum HBsAg is undetectable despite the presence of episomal-free HBV genome in the hepatocytes. This phenomenon of ‘false occult HBV’ occurs due to mutations in the pre-S region of the viral genome. False OBI may be seen in up to 40% of patients with OBI[ 100 101 102 103 Existing studies have highlighted the increased prevalence of OBI in a cohort of patients with an increased risk of developing HBV: Injectable drug abuse, coinfection with HCV, and individuals on hemodialysis[ 104 106 107 110 10 111 113 Table 10 Highlights the chemotherapeutic drugs associated with a high risk of occult hepatitis B virus infection reactivation  Drug  Mechanism of action  Ref. Rituximab Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody [ 111 113 Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisolone  Rituximab: [ 117  Cyclophosphamide:  Hydroxydaunorubicin:  Oncovin: Ofatumumab; Alemtuzumab; Baricitinib Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody; Anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody; Janus kinase inhibitor [ 111 118 Individuals undergoing renal transplantation involving anti-HBc positive donors, those with HIV coinfection, rheumatic disorders treated with biological therapy, and those receiving high doses of corticosteroids over a prolonged period carry an intermediate risk of viral reactivation[ 114 115 100 116 VIROLOGICAL PROFILE OF PATIENTS WITH OBI The detection of anti-HBc in addition to anti-HBs antibodies has been used as a surrogate marker for OBI. Our current understanding of the biological behavior of OBI suggests that patients with anti-HBc/anti-HBs antibodies undergoing immunosuppression tend to experience a progressive decline in the titer of anti-HBs before it finally disappears. This correlates with the reappearance of HbsAg-positive status in individuals who develop clinical/virological reactivation[ 117 120 The detection of HBV DNA in the serum of patients with OBI has to be interpreted in light of the fact that the presence of DNA establishes a diagnosis of ‘OBI carrier’. Detection of anti-HBc, although used as a surrogate, is an imprecise method to prove OBI status. The detection of HBV DNA in titers > 200 IU/mL helps to differentiate patients with S escape mutants. This is valuable as the therapeutic approach differs between the above-mentioned (S escape mutants and OBI) subset of patients[ 121 At present, antiviral therapy is not recommended for individuals with OBI. However, there is an ardent need to prevent OBI reactivation and, therefore, prevent the development of acute hepatitis in individuals with suppressed immunity. PREVENTION OF OBI TRANSMISSION Blood transfusion: Transmission of HBV by OBI-positive blood donors is a major unmet health need, especially in places where anti-HBc and nucleic acid amplification tests are not available. Multiple factors affect the risk of transmission from an OBI-positive donor, notably, the immune status of the recipient and the quantity of plasma transfused. It has been proposed that OBI donors who are anti-HBc positive may be more infectious than those with anti-HBs positive status[ 122 et al 123 123 121 CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE AND OBI Current evidence dictates the fact that minimal, prolonged inflammation induced by OBI is recognized as a risk factor for the progression of liver disease in patients who are also coinfected with HCV[ 124 126 127 129 HCC AND OBI Research has highlighted an overwhelming association between OBI and HCC. OBI has been documented in the liver tissue specimens of up to 70% of patients suffering from cryptogenic cirrhosis and HCC[ 130 132 133 134 135 Routine prophylactic treatment for OBI is not supported by sufficient evidence; however, treatment may be initiated for individuals at a high risk of reactivation. These high-risk individuals should be screened for serological evidence of OBI: Anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA assay before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Monitoring should be continued for months or years after withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy to screen for viral reactivation, as antibody titers may fall secondary to initiation of therapy. Antiviral drugs should be initiated for OBI individuals, especially those who have tested negative for anti-HBs antibodies. It is recommended that treatment be initiated before the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy and continued for around six months after withdrawal of treatment. Japanese guidelines recommend monthly HBV DNA monitoring during the period of chemotherapy and for one year thereafter. To minimize the risk of blood transfusion-related infection, it is also recommended to use HBV DNA NAT and multivalent anti-HBs antibodies to detect true and false OBI, respectively, while screening for blood donation[ 136 137 CONCLUSION HBV infection is a perplexing entity with myriad clinical, virological, and immunological manifestations. An ever-increasing body of knowledge indicates that the infection may continuously persist in the hepatocytes even when active viral replication is suppressed. There is a dilemma to treat whenever one encounters CHB in the so-called IT phase or indeterminate phase, or for that matter, an OBI. The endpoints of therapy do exist, but whether HCC is being prevented is still debatable, according to the existing guidelines. To add to the complexity, large geographical regions of the world are endemic to HBV with poor healthcare infrastructure. Hence, the treatment protocols must be revised and expanded based on the background of more robust local data. We suggest initiating treatment in IT-phase patients with HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL and age > 30, using non-invasive fibrosis assessments to identify high-risk individuals, although firm recommendations can only be made after the availability of strong evidence in this regard.
