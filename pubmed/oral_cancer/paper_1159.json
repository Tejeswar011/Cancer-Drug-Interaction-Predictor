However, it is prone to falling into local optima and remains inadequate for seed classification tasks that involve hyperparameter optimization of machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). To overcome these limitations, an Enhanced Knowledge-based Salp Swarm Algorithm (EKSSA) is proposed.

Introduction Swarm intelligence algorithms (SIAs) [ 1 2 3 4 1 5 6 7 3 A Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a metaheuristic optimization technique modeled after the swarming and foraging behavior of salps in marine environments [ 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 For the classification task, SIAs are usually utilized to optimize the hyperparameters of the classifier network [ 16 17 18 16 17 18 19 20 21 In the field of smart agriculture, the application of SIAs can effectively enhance the efficiency of plant disease diagnosis [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 To address the aforementioned challenges, this study proposes an enhanced-knowledge Salp Swarm Algorithm (EKSSA) to optimize the critical parameters of SVM in seed classification tasks. The proposed algorithm incorporates several strategic improvements to enhance its optimization performance. Specifically, adaptive adjustment mechanisms for parameters c 1 α To enhance the performance of the basic SSA, an enhanced-knowledge Salp Swarm Algorithm (EKSSA) is proposed, and its effectiveness is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Exploration and exploitation of the follower balances using different adjustment strategies for the parameters c 1 α A novel Gaussian mutation strategy and a dynamic mirror learning strategy are introduced to enhance global search capability and prevent EKSSA from becoming trapped in local optima. Many CEC benchmark functions are applied to evaluate the performance of the designed EKSSA, and two seed classification datasets are also utilized by the combination of EKSSA and the SVM algorithm which is named EKSSA-SVM. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 Section 3 Section 4 Section 5 Section 6 2. The Basic Salp Swarm Algorithm Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a metaheuristic optimization technique modeled after the swarming and foraging behavior of salps; the main steps are from the leader and followers. The mathematical model of the behavior corresponds to the optimization process of the proposed SSA. There are two key stages of the basic SSA: Population Initial Stage and Position Update Stage. 2.1. Population Initial Stage The optimization problem is assumed to have a D (1) X i , j = r a n d i , j · ( U B i , j − L B i , j ) + L B i , j X i , j i = 1 , 2 , … , N P j = 1 , 2 , … , D i m N P D i m r a n d i , j ( 0 ,  1 ) U B i , j L B i , j 2.2. Position Update Stage In the individual search process, the food source F (2) X j l e a d e r = F j + c 1 ( U B j − L B j ) c 2 + L B j , i f c 3 > 0.5 F j − c 1 ( U B j − L B j ) c 2 + L B j , i f c 3 ≤ 0.5 X j l e a d e r j F j j c 1 , c 2 c 3 ( 0 ,  1 ) After the leader position with respect to the food source, the exploration and exploitation of the follower balances by the parameter c 1 (3) c 1 = 2 · e x p − ( 4 · l T m a x ) 2 l T m a x (4) X j i = 1 2 X j i + X j i − 1 X j i i j i ≥ 2 3. The Proposed Enhanced Knowledge Salp Swarm Algorithm In this study, to overcome the shortage of SSA falling into local optimum, we use the improved method to optimize hyperparameter of the SVM classifier for seed classification tasks. We propose an adjustment strategy for the parameter α To enhance the performance between exploration and exploitation of the follower, the adjustment strategy of the parameter α (5) α = 1.5 · e x p − ( l T m a x ) 2 α l T m a x α Figure 1 α α > 1 α α < 1 Then, the follower’s position from Equation ( 4 (6) X j i = α · 1 2 X j i + X j i − 1 + r 1 · F j X j i i j i ≥ 2 r 1 F j j Notably, a new Gaussian mutation strategy is proposed to avoid falling into local optimum, and its expression is: (7) X j i = G a u s s i a n ( X j i , θ ) · | X j i − F j | θ X j i i j F j j G a u s s i a n ( X j i , θ ) (8) G a u s s i a n ( X j i , θ ) = 1 2 π θ e x p − ( F j − X j i ) 2 2 θ 2 In addition, the mirror learning strategy is employed to prevent the EKSSA from converging on local optima, thereby strengthening its global search performance, which is defined as: (9) X j i = r 2 · U B j + L B j 2 + U B j + L B j 2 k − X j i k r 2 k U B i , j L B i , j k (10) k = 1 + l T m a x 5 , i f r 3 > 0.5 1 , i f r 3 ≤ 0.5 r 3 l T m a x 3.1. Computational Complexity Analysis The test platforms can influence the consumption of optimization time for the same algorithm, which means that the designed EKSSA should be analyzed.

Results of EKSSA-SVM for Seed Classification High-quality seeds can help farmers achieve better profits and safe food. The classification of seeds through intelligent technology not only improves efficiency but also reduces the cost of manual screening. Thus, it is necessary for us to study the ML algorithm to identify seed varieties. The efficiency and accuracy of existing methods still hold potential for further improvement. Notably, there is also a gap for the seed classification task by the optimizing the hyperparameter of SVM using SIAs. In this research, two seed classification datasets were used to verify the performance of the proposed EKSSA. The SVM [ 37 c g Figure 7 38 f 1 , f 2 , … , f M M = 7 39 f 1 , f 2 , … , f M M = 16 (13) A c c = T P + T N T P + T N + F P + F N × 100 % , T P T N F P F N Notably, the features of the seed classification task are first normalized before being input into the classifier, which should be mapped between 0 and 1.
