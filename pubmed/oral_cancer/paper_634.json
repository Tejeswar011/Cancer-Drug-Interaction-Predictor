See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND Gastric cancer (GC) remains a substantial global health burden, and its early detection and treatment is critical for optimizing patient outcomes. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive technique for early GC but is linked to an increased risk of complications, such as delayed hemorrhage, which underscore the need for a comprehensive investigation into the disease’s risk factors. AIM To perform a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the literature to identify and quantify risk factors associated with late-onset bleeding subsequent to ESD for early GC. METHODS Studies reporting risk factors for delayed bleeding after ESD for early GC were identified through a comprehensive search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library). The selection of studies, data retrieval, and quality evaluation were carried out separately by two reviewers. The combined odds ratios (OR) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated utilizing a random-effects approach. The meta-analysis has been registered on the International Registry of Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202540116). RESULTS A total of 11 publications comprising 1945 patients were incorporated into the present analysis. The following risk factors were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of delayed bleeding after ESD: Long operation time (OR = 2.55, 95%CI: 2.40–2.72, I n I n I n I n I n I n I n CONCLUSION This meta-analysis identified several risk factors associated with an increased probability of delayed bleeding after ESD for early GC, including long operation time, lesions in the upper stomach, advanced age, antithrombotic drug use, large resection size, hemodialysis, and the presence of ulcers.

The search was performed using a combination of medical subject headings and free-text terms connected to ESD, early GC, and delayed bleeding. The search syntax included terms such as \"endoscopic submucosal dissection\", \"early GC\", \"bleeding\", \"postoperative complications\", and related synonyms. The search was limited to studies published in English between January 2000 and December 2024. This meta-analysis was registered with International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202540116). Inclusion and exclusion criteria Eligible publications were required to be observational (retrospective or prospective) and to report on patients who underwent ESD for early GC. Included studies had to assess data delayed bleeding as an outcome and provide information on potential risk factors. Exclusion criteria comprised studies focusing on non-ESD procedures, non-GC populations, reviews, case reports, or studies lacking insufficient multivariate analysis of risk factors. Additionally, the uniqueness and quality of the included data studies ensured by excluding overlapping datasets or incomplete data. Specifically, 11 retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria and were thus included in this meta-analysis. Study selection Potentially relevant studies were identified by initially screening the search results by title and abstract. The full-length articles of the remaining research studies were retrieved from relevant sources and examined, and whether they met the pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined. Two reviewers independently conducted the selection process, and any discrepancies were settled through discussions or by seeking advice from a third reviewer. Data extraction Through a standardized extraction form, information was retrieved from included publications. The data comprised the characteristics of these studies (For instance, aspects such as study design, sample size, and patient characteristics; procedural specifics like duration, lesion site, and extent of resection; as well as outcomes including the prevalence of delayed bleeding and the identified risk factors). Two reviewers independently conducted the extraction. Any discrepancy was resolved through a discussion. Quality assessment The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was utilized to assess the methodological rigor of the selected studies, focusing on three key areas: Selection, comparability, and outcome assessment. Each study was rated on a 0-9 point scale, where a higher score denoted superior quality. Studies that achieved a NOS score of 7 or above were deemed to have high quality and were incorporated into the meta-analysis. Statistical analysis The statistical evaluations were performed with RevMan 5.4 software (provided by the Cochrane Collaboration) and R 4.3.1 (R Foundation) to ensure methodological rigor. A random-effects model was used to estimate the combined odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), taking into consideration the heterogeneity among the studies. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I I I I I RESULTS Study selection The initial search of the literature yielded 2367 records from PubMed ( n n n n e.g. n n n n 1 Figure 1 PRISMA flowchart of study selection.

Quality assessment of the included publications All studies were of high-quality (NOS ≥ 7) and were published in English (Table 2 Table 2 Quality assessment form for the 11 included studies  Ref.

Owing to the limited number of publications, a meta-analysis for the specific risk factor was not feasible. However, the study did suggest the association of large lesions with increased risk of delayed bleeding after ESD. Long operation time Extended procedure was a common risk factor across five studies. The data showed that extended operation times were associated with amplified risk of delayed bleeding (OR = 2.55, 95%CI: 2.40-2.72, I 2 P 2A Figure 2  Forest plot illustrating the association between various risk factors and the occurrence of delayed bleeding following endoscopic submucosal dissection.

This finding was consistent across 5 studies (OR = 3.61, 95%CI: 3.47-3.76, I 2 P 2C History of taking antithrombotic drugs The utilization of antithrombotic drugs was linked to a higher incidence of delayed bleeding, as identified in three studies (OR = 2.58, 95%CI: 2.48-2.68, I 2 P 2D Resection size > 40 mm Large resection size was linked to increased incidence of delayed bleeding, as reported in five studies (OR = 3.01, 95%CI: 2.78-3.26, I 2 P 2E Hemodialysis Patients undergoing hemodialysis had an increased risk of delayed bleeding, as demonstrated in four studies (OR = 2.42, 95%CI: 2.33-2.51, I 2 P 2F Presence of ulcers The presence of ulcers was connected to slightly increased risk of delayed bleeding, as identified in three studies (OR = 2.54, 95%CI: 2.33-2.77, I 2 P 2G Subgroup analyses Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the consistency of the findings across varying study populations and methodologies. The outcomes were found to be consistent within these subgroups, suggesting the reliability of the identified risk factors. Meta-regression analysis The meta-regression analysis was conducted on risk factors with moderate to high heterogeneity to explore potential sources of variability (Table 3 P P vs vs P R Table 3 Meta-regression results for risk factors of delayed bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection  Risk factor  Covariate   β   P   R Advanced age Comorbidities 0.22 (0.11-0.33) 0.001 11% Antithrombotic use Drug type (aspirin vs 0.30 (0.18-0.42) 0.001 15% Resection size > 40 mm Hemostatic technique 0.18 (0.07-0.29) 0.002 10% Publication bias analysis Potential publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot ( Supplementary Figure 1 4 P P P Table 4 Publication bias analysis of Egger’s test  Risk factor  β (95%CI)   P Long operation time 0.82 (-0.34-2.00) 0.17 Upper stomach lesions 0.65 (-0.12-1.42) 0.10 Advanced age 0.78 (-0.21-1.77) 0.12 Antithrombotic use 0.91 (0.15-1.67) 0.02 Resection size > 40 mm 0.73 (-0.18-1.64) 0.11 Hemodialysis 0.61 (-0.22-1.44) 0.15 Ulcer presence 0.85 (0.09-1.61) 0.03 DISCUSSION GC remains a global public health concern, and its early detection and treatment lead to favorable prognosis. ESD has been established as a minimally invasive and highly effective method for the treatment of early GC, allowing for complete tumor resection and precise histopathological evaluation[ 12 20 21 The examination pinpointed several risk factors commonly linked to an elevated risk of delayed bleeding post-ESD. These factors encompassed prolonged procedural duration, lesions situated in the upper stomach region, age, history of taking antithrombotic drugs, resection size of > 40 mm, hemodialysis, and the presence of ulcers. The ORs for these factors were statistically significant, indicating a robust association with delayed bleeding. The association between long operation time and delayed bleeding is plausible because extended procedures may increase the risk of tissue damage and subsequent bleeding[ 22 23 24 25 26 27 The identification of these risk factors has important implications for clinical practice. Surgeons and gastroenterologists performing ESD should be aware of these factors and consider them when planning the procedure and managing postoperative care. For example, patients with a history of taking antithrombotic drugs may require temporary discontinuation of these medications before ESD, under the supervision of a hematologist or cardiologist, to reduce the risk of bleeding. Similarly, patients with huge lesions or lesions situated in the upper region of the stomach may require close monitoring postoperation for signs of bleeding[ 28 29 30 e.g. e.g. e.g. The observed associations between risk factors and delayed bleeding after ESD may be attributed to underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. For instance, long operation time could increase the risk of delayed bleeding because of the prolonged exposure of the submucosal layer to mechanical trauma and increased vascular disruption. Lesions in the upper stomach may be prone to bleeding because of the rich vascular supply of the fundus and corpus regions, which are susceptible to injury during dissection[ 31 32 33 These findings have considerable implications for clinical guidelines and perioperative protocols. For instance, the strong association between antithrombotic drug use and delayed bleeding underscores the need for standardized guidelines on perioperative management of patients on these medications, such as risk-stratified withdrawal strategies or alternative hemostatic approaches. Furthermore, the identification of upper stomach lesions as a risk factor highlights the importance of preoperative imaging to the delineation of lesion locations, which could inform intraoperative decision-making. Although this study provides valuable insights, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the included studies were predominantly retrospective, possibly introducing selection bias and limiting the strength of causal inferences. Second, heterogeneity in risk factor definitions ( e.g. e.g. e.g. e.g. CONCLUSION This study uncovered several risk factors that contribute to a heightened risk of delayed bleeding subsequent to ESD in the context of early GC. These insights carry significant relevance for clinical decision-making, highlighting the need for careful patient selection, procedure planning, postoperative monitoring, and reduction of the risk of this potentially serious complication. Future research should aim to prospectively validate these findings and to develop strategies for preventing and managing delayed bleeding after ESD. By addressing these challenges, clinicians can mitigate the risk of delayed bleeding and improve patient outcomes.
