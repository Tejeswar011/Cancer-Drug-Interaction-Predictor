Introduction Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a complex group of conditions that affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and surrounding muscles, leading to pain and dysfunction [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 4 5 3 6 The first approved temporomandibular injections appeared in 1989 [ 7 8 3 6 9 10 6 10 11 12 13 11 14 12 13 Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) are both autogenous injections derived from a patient’s own blood, rich in various growth factors that play crucial roles in healing and tissue regeneration [ 15 16 17 16 18 18 19 20 21 22 23 6 10 12 Autogenous injection, especially PRP and PRF, in the treatment of TMD, represents a promising frontier in regenerative medicine [ 13 15 15 16 17 18 This systematic review focused on studies investigating the use of autologous injections for treating TMD. The primary hypothesis of this review is that autologous injections are effective in alleviating pain and enhancing mandibular mobility in patients with TMD. The following paper will compare the outcomes from various clinical studies to assess this hypothesis. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Protocol and Registration This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 (PRISMA 2020) [ 24 2.2. Eligibility Criteria Studies were selected based on the PICOS framework [ 25 26 27 28 The following exclusion criteria were applied: animal studies; studies involving patients with systemic diseases that could significantly affect healing or inflammatory responses, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, or any form of cancer; case reports, case series, and reviews were excluded. The eligibility criteria are summarized in Table 1 2.3. Search Strategy A comprehensive search was conducted across electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. These databases were selected because they provide the most comprehensive coverage of biomedical, clinical, and interdisciplinary knowledge. Together, they ensured a broad and thorough search of the relevant literature. The search process was conducted between 6 April and 31 May 2025. Searches were limited to peer-reviewed journal articles; grey literature was not included. The search encompassed English-language studies published between 1 January 2015 and 1 May 2025. This time frame was selected to capture the most recent and clinically relevant evidence, as autogenous injection techniques for TMD have been primarily investigated within the past decade [ 3 5 The following search string was used in MEDLINE: (“platelet-rich plasma” OR “PRP” OR “platelet-rich fibrin” OR “PRF” OR “autogenous injection” OR “injection” OR “stem cells” OR “exosomes”) AND (“temporomandibular disorders” OR “TMD” OR “temporomandibular joint dysfunction” OR “temporomandibular joint” OR “TMJ pain” OR “TMJ arthralgia” OR “TMJ degenerative disease” OR “masticatory muscles” OR “masticatory muscle pain” OR “masseter muscle” OR “temporal muscle”). Equivalent search strategies were adapted for Embase and Web of Science according to the indexing and syntax of each database. 2.4. Selection Process All identified references were imported into Rayyan QCRI (Qatar Computing Research Institute, Doha, Qatar, and Rayyan Systems, Cambridge, MA, USA) to optimize the screening process [ 29 2.5. Data Collection The data were extracted by two independent reviewers (P.S. and S.O.) using a standardized form, collecting the following: (1) Author; (2) year of publication; (3) number of participants; (4) study design; (5) assessment method (DC/TMD, ICOP); (6) TMD diagnosis type; (7) Intervention type; (8) Comparator; (9) Outcomes. Outcomes included pain intensity (e.g., VAS, NRS), mandibular mobility (e.g., Maximum Mouth Opening), quality of life measures, and reported adverse effects. As the included studies varied in clinical focus and design, not all outcomes were available across all articles. 2.6. Risk of Bias Assessment For a randomized controlled trial, the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool was applied [ 30 31 2.7. Data Synthesis A narrative synthesis was used to summarize the findings from the included studies. This method was chosen because the studies differed substantially in their design (randomized vs. non-randomized), types of autogenous injections (e.g., PRP, PRF, i-PRF), outcome measures (e.g., VAS, MMO), and follow-up durations. These variations made it inappropriate to conduct a meta-analysis. Therefore, the results were grouped narratively based on the type of intervention and comparator used, and discussed in the context of study design, clinical condition, and outcome domains. This approach allowed for a transparent comparison of effects across studies despite heterogeneity. 3. Results 3.1. Study Selection A total of 3728 potentially relevant studies were initially retrieved through database searches. After removing 980 duplicates, 2748 titles and abstracts were screened. During this stage, Rayyan’s automatic keyword highlighting tool was used to assist in identifying non-eligible studies. Based on the screening, 106 articles were selected for full-text reading. Following a thorough assessment, 13 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 Figure 1 45 3.2. Study Characteristics A total of 13 studies were included in this systematic review. The studies were published between 2015 and 2024 and involved a combined sample of 926 participants. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 128 individuals per study. Among the included studies, six were randomized controlled trials, while the remaining seven were non-randomized clinical studies, including non-randomized controlled trials and retrospective cohort studies. Among the included studies, the most commonly used diagnostic system was the RDC/TMD, applied in nine studies, followed by Di DC/TMD, used in three studies. The ICOP was employed in one study. The included studies addressed both intra-articular and myogenous forms of TMD. Articular conditions encompassed internal derangement, disc displacement with or without reduction, TMJ osteoarthritis, and TMJ pain. Myogenous conditions primarily included myofascial pain and localized masticatory muscle tenderness. Details of the included studies are presented in Table 2 Table 3 3.3. Risk of Bias Among the thirteen included studies, the risk of bias was evaluated using tools appropriate to their design. Nine studies were assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and four studies were evaluated using the JBI checklist for quasi-experimental studies. Seven studies were rated as having a low risk of bias [ 33 34 35 36 38 40 41 32 37 39 42 43 44 Table 4 3.4. Evaluation of the Quality of the Evidence The quality of the evidence presented in the studies, with overall GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) scores for outcomes, is shown in Table 5 The studies reviewed in this study were very heterogeneous; therefore, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, and instead, a narrative and qualitative summary was prepared. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence for outcomes [ 46 33 34 38 40 41 44 32 35 36 37 39 42 43 3.5. TMD Type 3.5.1. Myogenous TMD Three studies focused on patients with muscle-related TMD. Nitecka-Buchta et al. evaluated intra-muscular PRP injections into the masseter muscle and reported a 58.15% reduction in pain intensity by day 5 and a 47.16% reduction by day 14, compared with only 10.24% and 4.62% reductions in the placebo group ( p 42 43 43 39 3.5.2. Articular TMD Ten studies investigated intra-articular conditions such as disc displacement and temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis. Mathpati et al. demonstrated significant improvements with PRP injections, where mean VAS pain scores decreased from 6.8 ± 1.2 at baseline to 2.1 ± 1.0 after eight weeks ( p p 34 p p 33 41 p p 32 37 p p 44 36 p p 35 p 40 p 38 In summary, intra-articular autogenous injections, particularly PRP and i-PRF, consistently reduced pain and improved mandibular mobility in articular TMD. The greatest and most durable benefits were observed when autogenous preparations were combined with arthrocentesis. Although hyaluronic acid demonstrated superior effects on mandibular mobility in some trials, autogenous injections provided more consistent long-term analgesia and functional stability. 3.6. Preparation Type 3.6.1. Injectable Platelet-Rich Fibrin Vingender et al. examined the effectiveness of platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF) therapy. The researchers evaluated the efficacy of various substances—hyaluronic acid (HA), PRP, and I-PRF—used in intra-articular injections to treat temporomandibular joint disc displacement. Sixty-eight patients were divided into three groups, and the study measured outcomes such as maximum mouth opening (MMO) and pain levels using the VAS scale. A significant reduction in pain ( p p 35 Yuce et al. tested three different therapies in their study: arthrocentesis (AO), arthrocentesis plus injection of hyaluronic acid (A+HA), and arthrocentesis plus injection of liquid platelet-rich fibrin (A+I-PRF). The follow-up period was 12 months, during which they assessed results using the VAS scale and MMO. All groups demonstrated a significant decrease in pain levels over time. The A+I-PRF group showed a significantly greater reduction in pain compared to the A+HA group 12 months post-treatment ( p 40 Isik et al. also observed similar findings when examining patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis in two groups: the first receiving I-PRF + arthrocentesis, and the control group receiving only arthrocentesis. The follow-up period was 12 months. Clinical assessments included VAS, MMO, and lateral and protrusive jaw movements. Clinical outcomes showed that the I-PRF group experienced rapid and significant pain reduction in months 1 and 2 ( p p 38 3.6.2. Platelet-Rich Plasma Mathpati et al. conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of PRP injections in young adults with mild TMD. The study included 128 participants aged 18–35, randomly assigned to either a PRP treatment group or a placebo group. The PRP group received intra-articular injections of 0.5 mL of PRP per temporomandibular joint, while the placebo group received 0.5 mL of normal saline. The primary outcome measures were TMJ pain (evaluated with the VAS scale), maximum mouth opening (MMO), lateral excursions, and patient-reported outcomes related to daily activities. After eight weeks, the PRP group experienced a statistically significant reduction in pain (VAS score decreased from 6.8 ± 1.2 to 2.1 ± 1.0, p p p 34 Nitecka-Buchta et al. conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the analgesic effect of platelet-rich plasma intra-muscular injections in treating myofascial pain within the masseter muscle in patients diagnosed with TMD. A total of 59 patients were randomized into two groups: one receiving PRP injections and the other receiving isotonic saline as a placebo. Each patient underwent three bilateral intra-muscular injections (six sites total, 0.5 mL per site) into the masseter muscles. Pain intensity was assessed using the VAS on days 0, 5, and 14. The PRP group demonstrated a 58,15% reduction in pain on day 5 and a 47,16% reduction on day 14, whereas the placebo group showed reductions of only 10,24% and 4,62%, respectively ( p 42 Checinski et al. conducted a prospective clinical study to compare the effectiveness of PRP and hyaluronic acid intra-articular injections in improving mandibular mobility and reducing joint pain in patients with TMD. A total of 78 patients (128 TMJs) were assigned to two equal groups of 39 patients each, receiving either HA or PRP in five sessions at 7–10 day intervals. Clinical outcomes were assessed using maximum mouth opening (MMO) and the VAS for pain recorded at baseline and follow-up. The HA group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all directions ( p p p 33 Rajput et al. conducted a prospective clinical study to compare the clinical effectiveness of intra-articular PRP injections with arthrocentesis in patients with groups II and III of RDC/TMD. A total of 24 patients were equally divided into two groups. One group received a single PRP injection into the superior joint space, while the other group received arthrocentesis with Ringer’s lactate. Clinical assessments were performed over a 12-month period, evaluating pain (VAS), painless and maximum mouth opening, lateral jaw movement, and joint tenderness. In both groups, intragroup comparisons revealed statistically significant improvements in pain and mandibular mobility. In the arthrocentesis group, VAS scores improved significantly ( p p p p p 32 Kutuk et al. examined the clinical effects of intra-articular PRP, hyaluronic acid, and corticosteroid (CS) injections in the treatment of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA). Sixty patients diagnosed with TMJ-OA were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and received 1 mL injections monthly for three months. Pain (VAS), crepitation, loss of function, and muscle strength were assessed on a monthly basis. A Friedman test showed a statistically significant reduction in pain over time across all treatment groups combined ( p p p 44 Yilmaz et al.’s study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of local anesthesia (LA), botulinum toxin (BTX), and PRP injections for treating myofascial trigger points (TrPs) in the masseter muscle. Conducted as a retrospective study, it included 82 patients with myofascial TrPs in the masseter muscle, divided into three groups: 27 patients received LA injections, 26 received BTX injections, and 29 received PRP injections. The findings showed that all treatment methods improved symptoms at both 1 and 3 months. However, BTX injections were superior, showing significant improvements in pain, jaw function, and quality of life up to 6 months. LA injections were effective in the short term, while PRP showed less improvement compared to the other methods. The study concluded that BTX injections offer longer-lasting relief for myofascial TrPs in the masseter muscle [ 43 Jamal et al. conducted a prospective observational clinical trial involving 10 participants (9 women and 1 man) aged between 27 and 75 years, who suffered from painful dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a single PRP injection in reducing joint pain and improving mandibular motion. The study revealed that 7 out of 10 patients experienced a significant decrease in pain intensity (more than a 50% reduction), 2 patients showed partial symptom resolution, and 1 patient showed no improvement and subsequently underwent arthrocentesis. The average pain score decreased from 7.3 preoperatively to 3.9 postoperatively. The study concluded that PRP injections have a statistically significant and strong correlation with pain reduction, supporting their role as an effective treatment for TMJ internal derangement [ 37 Pihut with Gala study focuses on the effectiveness of two different intra-articular injection treatments, PRP and HA, for patients suffering from disc displacement without reduction. The study was designed as a double-blind clinical trial involving 100 patients diagnosed with TMD (IIb according to the RDC/TMD). Participants were alternately assigned to either the PRP group or the HA group, with 50 patients in each. The sample included a mix of genders, with the PRP group comprising 38 females and 12 males, while the HA group included 40 females and 10 males. All patients reported symptoms persisting for 10 days to 2 months prior to treatment, and each underwent a comprehensive functional examination of the masticatory system, assessing parameters such as maximal interincisal distance and pain intensity using a VAS. Both groups received intra-articular injections of either 0.4 mL of PRP or 0.4 mL of HA into the temporomandibular joint. This procedure was repeated three times at 10-day intervals. The outcomes indicated that both treatments resulted in significant improvements in pain and function, suggesting that both PRP and HA are effective options for managing TMD related to disc displacement without reduction [ 41 Agarwal et al. investigated the comparative effectiveness of PRP injection and dry needling for TrPs in the Masseter Muscle. The randomized controlled trial included 30 participants. Patients in the test group received a PRP injection of 0.5 mL per trigger point (TrP) in the masseter muscle using a 1.5-inch, 27-gauge needle. In contrast, the control group underwent dry needling (DN) at the TrPs in the masseter muscle with the same needle size, but without any solution. Based on the study’s findings, it can be concluded that PRP appears to be more effective than DN in treating myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in patients with myofascial pain syndrome [ 39 4. Discussion Patients with TMD often experience masticatory muscle pain and limited mouth opening, which, in advanced cases, can significantly hinder daily activities [ 47 48 49 47 48 49 50 From an economic standpoint, the cost of PRP/PRF treatments can vary significantly based on the provider, geographic location, and specific protocols used [ 4 4 5 6 9 Concomitant treatments, including the use of splints and medications, alongside patient characteristics such as age, gender, and disease duration, can have a considerable impact on treatment outcomes for TMD [ 51 52 52 53 Commonly recognized phenotypes include myogenic, arthrogenic, and mixed types [ 9 13 13 The most common scale used across all reviewed studies was VAS. Main limitations of the VAS include its reliance on the patient’s subjective interpretation of pain, which may vary based on individual differences in pain perception and expression. Additionally, VAS may not adequately capture the multidimensional nature of pain, such as its emotional or psychological components [ 54 4.1. Platelet-Rich Plasma Platelet-rich plasma is an autologous blood-derived product obtained through centrifugation of the patient’s peripheral blood. The final product is a plasma concentrate with a high platelet count and an abundance of growth factors such as PDGF, TGF-β, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and IGF, which play key roles in tissue regeneration and repair [ 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 In the management of TMD, the PRP injection technique involves intra-articular administration of the prepared concentrate directly into the temporomandibular joint space. PRP exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and regenerative properties, making it a promising alternative or adjunct to conventional conservative treatments for temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) [ 62 63 57 58 The studies reviewed demonstrate several benefits of using PRP in intra-articular injections. There is a significant reduction in pain and improvement in jaw function [ 33 34 37 44 39 42 32 4.2. Platelet-Rich Fibrin Injectable Platelet-Rich Fibrin is a second-generation autologous platelet concentrate, developed to overcome some of the limitations of traditional PRP and solid PRF. Solid platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), in its membrane or clot form, presents several limitations that may restrict its clinical applicability in dentistry. Due to its solid consistency, it cannot be injected into anatomically constrained sites, such as narrow bony defects or intra-articular spaces, where a liquid formulation like injectable PRF (i-PRF) may offer superior adaptability. Furthermore, solid PRF must be applied immediately after centrifugation, as the fibrin matrix rapidly dehydrates, leading to loss of biological activity. Finally, the dense fibrin architecture may impede the uniform diffusion of growth factors, potentially resulting in a less homogeneous and temporally restricted regenerative stimulus when compared with liquid platelet concentrates [ 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 The studies we analyzed proved the effectiveness of injection therapies using autologous preparations in patients with TMD. The authors of the studies describe the following effects after using PRF: increased mouth opening range and reduced pain [ 35 38 40 35 38 40 38 40 35 38 In addition to techniques using autologous preparations for intra-articular injections in patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction, several scientific studies have also explored the technique of isolated arthrocentesis and intra-articular injections of preparations such as hyaluronic acid, collagen, or glucocorticosteroids. 4.3. Arthrocentesis Arthrocentesis of the TMJ is a minimally invasive procedure that involves lavage of the joint space using a physiological solution, typically achieved by inserting two needles into the upper joint compartment. This technique is beneficial in the management of TMJ functional disorders, especially in cases of limited mandibular mobility, joint pain, and disc displacement without reduction (most beneficial in early stages of displacement without reduction) [ 72 Arthrocentesis can also serve as a method of access for intra-articular injections of anti-inflammatory drugs, hyaluronic acid, PRP, or i-PRF [ 73 74 75 Clinical studies show high efficacy of arthrocentesis in reducing joint pain and improving mouth opening in patients with TMJ dysfunction, particularly in those unresponsive to conservative therapy [ 76 77 78 4.4. Glucocorticosteroids Corticosteroids are frequently employed as a minimally invasive option for treating internal disorders of the TMJ. Their strong anti-inflammatory properties have been effective in alleviating joint-related pain. These agents work by suppressing the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as limiting the accumulation of immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, at inflammatory sites. Additionally, they prevent the buildup of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, by downregulating endothelial adhesion molecules and reducing the synthesis of plasminogen activators. Among the corticosteroids most often used for intra-articular applications are hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, prednisolone, and triamcinolone [ 79 80 81 In the literature, there are reports on the effectiveness of using corticosteroids in treating pain [ 80 82 83 84 85 Isacsson et al. also evaluated the effectiveness of a single intra-articular injection of methylprednisolone for pain relief in patients with TMJ arthritis, in comparison with a placebo. The study involved 26 patients in the methylprednisolone group and 26 in the placebo group. The intervention consisted of a single 40 mg intra-articular injection of methylprednisolone. The observation period lasted four weeks. Additionally, both groups received stabilization splint therapy. No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of resting pain or pain during mouth opening. The authors attributed the observed reduction in resting pain to the use of the occlusal splint [ 86 Frid et al. assessed the safety and efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections into the TMJ in adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), evaluating both clinical outcomes and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings. All patients received concurrent standard systemic treatment, including methotrexate or biological agents. MRI results showed a statistically significant reduction in the mean additive inflammatory score, from 4.4  ±  1.8 to 3.4  ±  2.0 ( p p 87 87 79 It is therefore worth noting that glucocorticosteroids can be an alternative to intra-articular injections of preparations derived from the patient’s blood in a specific group of patients, namely those with autoimmune diseases. This group of patients, particularly those with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, will develop a complex of symptoms associated with temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Consequently, it will also be a group of patients in whom injections of autogenous preparations may be contraindicated in some cases [ 88 89 90 4.5. Hyaluronic Acid Another substance successfully used in injections into the TMJ is hyaluronic acid. Baron et al. conducted a prospective, open-label pilot study to evaluate the effects of a single intra-articular injection of cross-linked hyaluronic acid with mannitol (HANOX-M-XL) in 36 patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA). Over a 6-month follow-up, significant improvements were observed: pain during chewing decreased from 6.9 to 2.9, and jaw opening increased from 29 mm to 35 mm. No serious side effects occurred. While specific trends suggested that prior intra-articular injection of HA with or greater early pain relief may predict higher satisfaction, no strong statistical predictors were identified. The study supports HANOX-M-XL as a safe, effective, and convenient single-injection option for managing TMJ-OA symptoms, though larger controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings [ 91 Hepguler et al. evaluated intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA, Orthovisc) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 38 patients with disc displacement with reduction. Patients received two HA or saline injections one week apart. At both 1 and 6 months, the HA group showed significant improvements in pain, joint sounds, and jaw function compared to the placebo group. Clinical improvement was observed in 89.5% of HA-treated patients at 1 month and 63% at 6 months. Therefore, the short duration of the effect indicates short-term effectiveness and is a certain limitation for the use of HA preparations. No adverse events were reported. The authors of the study report that HA injections are a safe and effective non-surgical option for managing TMJ disorders with disc displacement, offering benefits lasting up to 6 months [ 92 Chęciński et al. in their controlled clinical trial compared the effects of a single intra-articular injection of HA and PRP on mandibular mobility in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders. A total of 78 patients were divided equally into two groups (HA vs. PRP). Mandibular movements—mouth opening (abduction), protrusion, and lateral excursions—were measured after treatment. In this study, HA significantly improved mouth opening (+4.05 mm) and protrusion (+0.97 mm) compared to PRP. No significant differences were observed for lateral movements. HA was more effective than PRP in increasing mandibular mobility, particularly in cases of limited mouth opening. These findings may be attributed to the superior lubricating properties of hyaluronic acid. According to the authors, in cases of TMD characterized primarily by reduced mandibular mobility, intra-articular injections of HA appear to be more appropriate than PRP for symptomatic management [ 33 Peng et al. investigated the therapeutic effect of a single intra-articular injection combining PRP and HA in patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis. Twelve participants received one injection of a 1:1 PRP–HA mixture and were followed for six months. The treatment resulted in a marked reduction in pain intensity (VAS score decreased from 6.9 to 2.8) and a significant increase in mandibular mobility, with maximum mouth opening improving from 29.4 mm to 36.5 mm ( p 93 The systematic review by Agostini et al. provides a systematic organization of information regarding the use of HA in injections for patients with TMD. An umbrella review was conducted to evaluate the role of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) injections in the management of TMD. Eighteen systematic reviews were included, thirteen of which analyzed only randomized controlled trials. Overall, the evidence suggested that HA injections may provide pain reduction and functional improvement, although outcomes were not superior to corticosteroid injections. Platelet-derived products often demonstrated more favorable analgesic effects compared to HA. Importantly, HA injections appeared safe, with no serious adverse events reported other than transient pain at the injection site. However, the methodological quality of the included reviews was generally low, with only a small proportion rated as high quality. Consequently, while HA injections represent a promising option for symptom management in TMD, the certainty of the evidence remains limited, and further high-quality randomized trials with longer follow-up are required to confirm their efficacy [ 94 4.6. Collagen Sakr et al. compared the effectiveness of intra-articular injections of collagen versus HA in treating anterior disc displacement with reduction of the temporomandibular joint. Clinical outcomes were assessed using a modified Helkimo Index focusing on pain (P) and joint noise (S), at intervals of 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the second injection. The results showed significant improvement in both pain and joint noise within each group over time; however, there was no statistically significant difference between the collagen and HA groups at any follow-up point. This study is notable for being the first to investigate intra-articular collagen injections as a treatment for TMD. The findings support the efficacy of both HA and collagen, and suggest that collagen may represent a promising therapeutic option. However, collagen remains the least studied substance and requires further investigation for broader applications [ 95 Despite promising preliminary results obtained with PRP and PRF injections and the associated benefits in patient care, further research in larger RCTs is needed, focusing on reducing the risk of bias, to better define the benefits, applications, and protocols associated with the use of PRP or PRF in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disease. It would also be extremely valuable to combine autogenous preparations with hyaluronic acid, collagen, or to use only the arthrocentesis procedure. 4.7. Limitations of the Evidence The chosen primary studies vary in diagnoses, sample sizes, injectable medications, treatment protocols, and follow-up periods. Additionally, the fact that grey literature was not searched may have led to the omission of unpublished data, which could introduce publication bias. Because of the limitations of this systematic review, the findings should be interpreted carefully. Studies often do not include a control group, and when they do, different approaches are used, with specialists having varying levels of experience performing the treatments. For this reason, a meta-analysis was not suitable. 5. Conclusions In summary, all PRP and PRF injection protocols included in this review showed positive outcomes, relieving pain and improving mobility in patients with TMD, especially in short–medium-term follow-up. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to significant heterogeneity among the clinical studies included in this systematic review. Insufficient and inconsistent data were reported for predefined subgroups (such as stratification by age, sex, disease severity, or comorbidity status). In many instances, subgroup data were missing, inadequately reported, or based on small sample sizes, making any statistical pooling unreliable and susceptible to false-positive or false-negative findings. Therefore, more RCTs with similar methodology are needed to clarify this subject better and establish clear indications for the use of specific intra-articular injection agents in particular clinical situations. Arthrocentesis prior to injection also seems to have a beneficial effect on treatment outcomes. Consequently, it is important to study this topic uniformly and compare the clinical effects in terms of efficacy, safety, and long-term joint preservation against established injection therapies and analgesic effects in myogenous TMD with those of other intra-articular and intra-muscular injections, such as corticosteroids, collagen, or hyaluronic acid.
