Introduction Liver metastasis (LM) exhibits a high incidence in colorectal cancer (CRC), yet effective preventive therapies are still lacking. Based on the prophylactic principle of harmonizing the liver and spleen, Yanggan Yizhong (YGYZ) decoction has shown clinical effectiveness in preventing LM. This study aims to explore the active components and underlying mechanisms of YGYZ in the prevention and treatment of LM. Methods The components of YGYZ were analyzed using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with High-Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HR-MS/MS). The LM mouse model was established through intrasplenic injection of ct26-luc cells to evaluate the effect and safety of YGYZ on LM. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to create microbiota-altered mice, and liver tissue morphology along with HE staining was utilized to dynamically monitor LM progression. Flow cytometry and inflammatory factor assays were conducted to assess the immune microenvironment (IME) of the liver pre-metastatic niche (PMN). Additionally, 16S rRNA sequencing and bile acid (BA) metabolomics were employed to investigate the role of YGYZ in modulating gut microbiota (GM) and BA. Western blot analysis was performed to identify key targets of YGYZ in the GM-BA-immunity pathway. Results UPLC-HR-MS/MS analysis identified 95 compounds in YGYZ, Glycyrrhizic acid, Bergapten, and Icariin as the main compounds. YGYZ and its FMT inhibited LM of CRC with safety, inhibited CD11b+Ly6G+ and CD11b+Ly6C+ cells in the pre-metastatic stage, decreased CD11b+Ly6G+ cells in the metastatic stage, reduced immunosuppressive factors such as Arg-1, TGF-β, and IL-10, and improved the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio, regulating liver PMN. YGYZ also improved the GM structure, particularly decreasing the abundance of Clostridium in the LM mice. For the hepatic BAs profile, YGYZ increased the content of primary BAs—Nor cholic acid (NorCA), Taurocholic acid, Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid, and Tauro β-Muricholic Acid, and secondary BAs—ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), with similar trends in FMT, while YGYZ decreased NorCA, α-Muricholic acid, Tauro α-Muricholic acid, and UDCA in the fecal BA profile. YGYZ and its FMT dampened the protein expression of IL-6, STAT3, and pSTAT3, but only YGYZ downregulated kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15). Conclusion YGYZ may prevent LM by remodeling the GM and synergistically inhibiting KLF15 to regulate the enterohepatic BA cycle, and suppressing the proliferation and activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells through the IL-6/STAT3 pathway, thereby improving IME of liver PMN. colorectal cancer liver metastasis Yanggan Yizhong decoction gut microbiota bile acid immunosuppression The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Emerging pharmacological studies and clinical reports support the application of TCM formulations against LM. Yanggan Yizhong (YGYZ) decoction, a representative prescription based on the liver-spleen coordination principle, has demonstrated potential in both preventive and therapeutic clinical applications ( Zhao et al., 2020 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemical components of YGYZ by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry analysis YGYZ was provided by Wangjing Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, with raw materials sourced from Kangmei Pharmaceutical (China).

Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm) maintained at 35 °C using a Waters Synapt G2-Si Q-TOF mass spectrometer. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (phase A) and acetonitrile (phase B) with a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The gradient elution program was as follows: 0–15 min, 100–80% A; 15–50 min, 80–0% A; 50–60 min, 0% A; 60–70 min, 0–100% A. Mass spectrometric analysis was conducted using a Q-Exactive system with an injection volume of 10 μL. 2.2 Animal experiments All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Experimentation Center of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (Approval No. ERCCACMS21-2302-07). The sample size was determined following the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines, based on effect size estimation from preliminary experiments and calculation of the model’s coefficient of variation, while adhering to the 3R principles of animal ethics. For information on animal numbers, refer to the figure legends. All experiments used BALB/c mice (male, 6–8 weeks, 18–20 g) that were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology (License No. SCXK (Jing) 2021-0006). The animals were housed in specific pathogen-free facilities with controlled temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity (50 ± 10%). After 7-day acclimation with ad libitum feed/water, mice were maintained under 12:12 light: dark cycles. Animals were randomly divided into six experimental groups using a random number table. LM models were established using a spleen-preserving technique ( Xu et al., 2020 6 Nair and Jacob, 2016 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was conducted as previously described ( Wu et al., 2021 Zong et al., 2023 For in vivo In-Vivo 2.3 Tests of liver and kidney function Liver and kidney function were assessed in serum samples using standardized colorimetric kits (Jiangsu Zecheng Biotechnology, China) with the following references: alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 20192400200), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 20192400201), blood urea nitrogen (BUN, 20192400212), and creatinine (CRE, 20192400214). 2.4 Hematoxylin and eosin staining Liver tissues were immediately fixed and paraffin-embedded, then sliced with a 3 μm thickness and air-dried. Stained with hematoxylin for nuclei and with eosin for cytoplasm after returning to the blue. Finally, dehydrated and sealed for examination by a microscope and image collection. 2.5 Immunohistochemical assay Liver tissues were immediately fixed and paraffin-embedded. Serial sections (3 μm) were cut, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95 °C for 15 min. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary anti-Ki-67 antibody (1:200, BS-23103R, Beijing Boaosen Biotechnology, China) in a humidified chamber. Immunoreactivity was visualized using DAB chromogen, followed by hematoxylin counterstaining and sealed. Ki-67-positive cells were quantified under an Olympus BX53 microscope (Olympus, Japan). 2.6 Immunofluorescence staining Paraffin-embedded liver sections (3 μm) were deparaffinized and rehydrated through graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (pH = 6.0) at 95 °C for 15 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Sections were incubated with optimally diluted primary antibodies in a humidified chamber at 4 °C overnight. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied for 50 min at room temperature (RT). Following microwave-mediated epitope recovery, the third antigen was detected using fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (50 min, RT, light-protected). Nuclear counterstaining was performed with DAPI, followed by autofluorescence quenching (Solution B, 5 min) and mounting with anti-fade medium. Multispectral images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). Antibodies purchased from BioLegend Corporation (United States) were used for target detection: APC anti-mouse CD3 Antibody (1:200, 100235), PE anti-mouse CD4 Antibody (1:200, 100407), FITC anti-mouse CD8 Antibody (1:200, 140403), APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse/human CD11b Antibody (1:200, 101225), APC anti-mouse Ly-6G Antibody (1:200, 127613), FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C Antibody (1:200, 128005). 2.7 Flow cytometry Liver tissues were enzymatically digested with 0.25% trypsin solution. The filtered cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended to obtain single-cell preparations. Cells were stained with the following fluorescently conjugated antibodies from BioLegend Corporation (United States): CD11b, Ly6G, Ly6C, CD3, CD4, and CD8. An unstained control was included for compensation. After 30 min incubation at 4 °C protected from light, cells were washed and fixed in 500 μL PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde. Flow cytometry (Changzhou Bidak Biotechnology, China) was performed, and FlowJo7.6.1 Software (United States) was used to analyze the results. 2.8 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Liver tissue homogenates were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants were collected and diluted uniformly. Cytokine levels were quantified using commercial ELISA kits (Beijing Bioassay Systems Biotechnology, China): Arg-1 (arginase-1, MD35262), TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β, MD132594-1), IL-10 (interleukin-10, MD106493 MD106412 2.9 16S rRNA sequencing Fresh fecal samples were collected to extract total microbial DNA, with DNA concentration and purity assessed by NanoDrop (United States). Sequencing libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Nano DNA LT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, United States). Libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq following standard denaturation (NaOH) and dilution protocols. Microbiome analysis was performed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology. Metabolic pathway information was determined through the MetaCyc database. 1 2.10 Metabolomic analysis of BAs Fresh fecal and liver tissue samples were collected for analysis. BAs profiling was performed using an ACQUITY UPLC ® Supplementary Table S1 2.11 Western blot Homogenized tissues were lysed in lysis solution, mixed, and then cells were broken by sonication at maximum power (3 × 10s) and centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 15 min) to collect the supernatant. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay, with samples normalized to 5 mg/mL. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at RT, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (Affinity Biosciences, United States): anti-β-actin (1:5000, AF7018), anti-kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) (1:1000, DF12203), anti-STAT3 (1:2000, AF6294), and anti-pSTAT3 (Tyr705, 1:1000, AF3293). Following washes, membranes were probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h at RT. Protein bands were visualized using enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL). 2.12 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 (IBM, United States), and graphs were generated with GraphPad Prism 9.0 Software (United States). All continuous variables were first assessed for normality. For multiple-group comparisons of normally distributed data, one-way ANOVA was employed, followed by appropriate post-hoc post-hoc p 3 Results 3.1 YGYZ inhibited LM from CRC with a safety profile Phytochemical profiling of YGYZ by UPLC-HR-MS/MS identified 95 compounds ( Supplementary Table S2 Figure 1 Figure 1 Representative base peak chromatogram of YGYZ in the positive and negative ion modes.

Panel B shows negative ion mode with notable peaks at 24.58, 30.91, and 40.86 minutes. To evaluate YGYZ’s preventive effects on LM, we established the model via intrasplenic injection of ct26-luc cells (Day 0), followed by 24-day YGYZ administration ( Figure 2A Figure 2B Figure 2C Figure 2C Figure 2D Figure 2E Figure 2F Figure 2 YGYZ inhibited liver metastasis (LM) from colorectal cancer with a safety profile.

Panel B shows histological H&E stained liver sections, highlighting tissue morphology at the same time points and treatment groups, with magnified views demonstrating structural differences. Scale bars indicate 1mm and 100 micrometers. HE staining revealed distinct metastatic progression phases. At day 12, the liver exhibited no observable metastases across all groups, demonstrating preserved hepatic architecture with orderly hepatocyte cords and intact portal triads. By day 24, the Model developed extensive metastatic lesions characterized by hypercellular tumor colonies displaying malignant features including nuclear pleomorphism, loss of cellular polarity, and prominent tumor vasculature. Therapeutic interventions significantly reduced the metastatic burden versus the Model ( Figure 3B in vivo 3.2 YGYZ and FMT remodeled the PMN by suppressing MDSCs Flow cytometry revealed that during the pre-metastasis period on day 12, the proportions of hepatic PMN-MDSCs and G-MDSCs were reduced in the Cap, YGYZ-H, and FMT groups, compared with the Model. On day 24 (LM period), the proportions of hepatic PMN-MDSCs were reduced in the Cap, YGYZ-H, and FMT groups, with no significant difference in the proportion of G-MDSCs ( Figure 4A Figure 4B Figure 4 YGYZ and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) remodeled the pre-metastatic niche at different stages of liver metastasis.

Statistical significance is indicated with symbols. 3.3 YGYZ and FMT reduced liver PMN immunosuppressive factors MDSCs-derived cytokine profiling indicated significant immunosuppressive activity within the hepatic microenvironment during the pre-metastatic phase (Day 12). Compared to Sham group, the Model group exhibited elevated levels of prototypic MDSC-secreted factors, including Arg-1, TGF-β, and IL-10. Cap, YGYZ-H, and FMT groups significantly attenuated these immunosuppressive mediators versus the Model ( Figure 4D 3.4 YGYZ and FMT improved the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio The CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio is a critical indicator of immune function, with low ratios indicating immunosuppression. Flow cytometry revealed that on days 12 and 24, the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio decreased in the Model compared with the Sham group. On day 12, YGYZ-H and FMT groups raised the ratio compared with the Model. On day 24, the Cap, YGYZ-H, and FMT groups elevated the ratio compared with the Model, but no statistical difference was seen in the latter two groups ( Figure 4C 3.5 YGYZ and FMT ameliorated the GM composition of the LM mouse To investigate differences in GM composition during the pre-metastatic stage, Venn diagram analysis was performed to identify shared and unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among five groups. A total of 179 OTUs were shared across all groups, while the Sham, Model, Cap, YGYZ, and FMT groups contained 2,304, 3,355, 1,103, 2,846, and 3,515 unique OTUs, respectively ( Figure 5A Figure 5B Figure 5C Figure 5 YGYZ and fecal microbiota transplantation impacted the diversity of gut microbiota (GM).

The indices show various levels of significance, indicated by asterisks. Color codes represent groups, with a legend on the right. Compared to the Model group, both the YGYZ-H and FMT groups showed an increased abundance of Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes, resulting in a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio at the phylum level ( Figure 6A Figure 6B Figure 6C Figure 6D Figure 6 YGYZ impacted the abundance of gut microbiota (GM) at different taxonomic levels.

The y-axis shows relative abundance percentages. 3.6 YGYZ reduced the Clostridium abundance of the LM mouse To compare intergroup differences in microbial composition, a clustered heatmap was generated using the top 30 most abundant genera, revealing distinct taxa distribution patterns. Analysis of the heatmap showed that the Model group was enriched in Coprococcus, Clostridium, Alistipes, Sutterella, and Prevotella. Both YGYZ and FMT demonstrated the capacity to reduce these enriched GM genera while increasing the abundance of Akkermansia, Eubacterium, Dehalobacterium, Bifidobacterium, and Mucispirillum ( Figure 7A Lin et al., 2025 Figure 7B Figure 7C Figure 7 Effects of YGYZ on gut microbiota (GM) composition and function.

At the hepatic BAs level, OPLS-DA revealed a separation trend between the Sham, Model, YGYZ-H, and FMT groups, indicating intergroup differences ( Figure 8A Figure 8B Figure 8C Figure 8D Figure 8 Effects of YGYZ on hepatic and fecal bile acids (BAs) profiles.

At the fecal BAs level, OPLS-DA showed no clear separation among the four groups ( Figure 8E Figure 8F Figure 8G Figure 8H Significant correlations were observed between GM at the genus level and BAs profiles. At the hepatic BAs level, UDCA showed a positive correlation with Coprococcus, and TCDCA was positively correlated with Coprococcus but negatively associated with Clostridium ( Figure 9A Figure 9B Figure 9 Pearson correlation heatmaps between gut microbiota (GM) at genus level and enterohepatic bile acid (BA) metabolism in mice.

The data is clustered to highlight patterns and relationships. 3.8 KLF15 may mediate YGYZ’S regulatory effects on the hepatic BAs-IL-6/STAT3 axis Hepatic KLF15 is a central regulatory node for BAs metabolism ( Han et al., 2015 Figure 8A Tengesdal et al., 2021 Figure 10A Figure 10B Figure 10 YGYZ downregulated KLF15, STAT3, pSTAT3, and IL-6 protein expression.

Panel B illustrates a bar graph of IL-6 levels, with notable differences between groups, marked by asterisks. Panel C is a schematic depicting the pre-metastatic niche involving liver, KLF15, MDSCs, T cells, BAs, IL-6, and phosphorylated STAT3, showing interactions with gut microbiota and YGYZ substances. Integrative analysis demonstrated that YGYZ preserved the enterohepatic BAs homeostasis through KLF15 downregulation and GM modulation. This led to suppression of MDSCs proliferation through IL-6/STAT3 pathway, exerting the effect of preventing and controlling LM by strengthening the IME of PMN ( Figure 10C 4 Discussion The liver receives dual blood supply from both the hepatic artery and portal vein with low blood flow velocity, yet the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells possess the most permeable endothelial barrier, creating a particularly favorable microenvironment for cancer cell invasion ( Mielgo and Schmid, 2020 Chen et al., 2025 Lin et al., 2019 Zhang et al., 2019 The IME differs significantly between liver PMN and LM, highlighting the importance of investigating interventions targeting PMNs as a means of preventing LM. MDSCs exert a pivotal role in mediating the formation of liver PMN, being recruited to the liver by tumor-derived secretory factors before cancer cells arrive. Once in the liver, MDSCs actively remodel the IME, facilitating subsequent cancer cell colonization ( Conche et al., 2023 Zeng et al., 2021 Hatziioannou et al., 2017 Wang et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2017 The gut and liver are anatomically and functionally interconnected through the portal vein and biliary system, forming the gut-liver axis, which influences maintaining hepatic immune and functional homeostasis ( Tian et al., 2023 Ma et al., 2018 Morris et al., 2023 Villéger et al., 2018 Di Pierro, 2021 C. difficile Bassotti et al., 2023 Anderson and Sears, 2023 Ma et al., 2018 Yue et al., 2020 + + + + Yu et al., 2023 + + + Routy et al., 2018 + + Dysregulated BAs metabolism has been identified as a risk factor for CRC development and metastasis. Approximately 95% of BAs are absorbed in the distal ileum and re-enter the enterohepatic circulation, while the remaining 5% serve as substrates for GM metabolism, where they are converted into secondary BAs by bacterial bile salt hydrolase activity. These secondary BAs participate in various physiological and pathological processes ( Zeng et al., 2019 Farhana et al., 2016 Deng et al., 2022 Peiró-Jordán et al., 2012 Khare et al., 2008 Shen et al., 2022 Lindström et al., 2012 Sayin et al., 2013 KLF15 serves as a central regulator of endogenous metabolism and maintains the BAs pool homeostasis by orchestrating BAs synthesis, transport, and metabolic processes in the liver ( Wang et al., 2020 Chen et al., 2023 Han et al., 2015 Wang et al., 2020 Roh et al., 2018 Chai et al., 2012 5 Conclusion In summary, YGYZ effectively prevented LM and modulated hepatic PMN with a favorable safety profile. Mechanistically, YGYZ might reshaped GM composition and suppressed KLF15 to repair enterohepatic BAs dysregulation, thereby repressing IL-6/STAT3-driven MDSCs expansion and activation. This multi-modal action reshaped the immunosuppressive PMN into a metastasis-restrictive microenvironment in the liver. These findings not only elucidate the mechanistic basis underlying the TCM principle of “liver–spleen coordination” but also propose GM and BAs profiles as promising predictive biomarkers for LM risk. From a clinical perspective, YGYZ represents a safe and promising complementary strategy that could be integrated into current therapeutic regimens to prevent LM and modulate the PMN. However, this study has several limitations that warrant further investigation. The quantitative relationship between KLF15 expression levels and GM composition/ BAs metabolic profiles remains unclear, necessitating deeper exploration of its regulatory network. Although FMT experiments demonstrated anti-metastatic effects of microbiota transplantation, the impact of transplantation frequency on recipient microbiota colonization stability requires systematic evaluation. Additionally, the key active components in the herbal formulation targeting KLF15 and IL-6/STAT3 pathways, along with their synergistic mechanisms, demand further elucidation. Future studies should focus on elucidating KLF15’s interaction with the GM-BAs axis through correlation analysis and KLF15 knockdown experiments, optimizing FMT protocols by assessing frequency-dependent effects on bacterial colonization stability, isolating and characterizing bioactive components to establish component-target-pathway networks, and conducting pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics studies followed by clinical trials to facilitate translational application of these findings.  1 https://metacyc.org/ Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary material Ethics statement The animal study was approved by the Medical Experimentation Center of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (Approval No. ERCCACMS21-2302-07).
