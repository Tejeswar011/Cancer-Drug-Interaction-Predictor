However, biomarkers for favorable therapy or to predict patient prognosis remain lacking. In this study, we evaluated five candidate biomarkers potentially involved in the efficacy of cisplatin or S-1 by immunostaining tumor specimens obtained from JCOG1113 participants. The participants were randomly divided into training or test sets and classified into high- or low-expression groups based on the cutoff value calculated from the immunostaining results for each biomarker in the training set. Associations between the expression of each biomarker and the outcomes in JCOG1113 were analyzed. Among the 148 eligible participants, no interaction was observed between the treatment arms of GC or GS for any factor or biomarker. However, high excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 (ERCC1) was associated with poor overall survival (HR, 2.226; 95% CI, 1.160–4.272) and progression-free survival (HR, 1.793; 95% CI, 0.945–3.402) compared with low ERCC1 in the training set. Similar trends were observed for the test set. Our results indicate that in advanced BTC, high ERCC1 expression is a poor prognostic factor.

In prognosis prediction, a high neutrophil-to-eosinophil ratio (NER) and elevated Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic scores are associated with poorer OS and PFS across various cancer types 12 13 ERCC1 is involved in the nuclear excision repair pathway that identifies and eliminates cisplatin-induced DNA adducts 14 16 TS, DPD, TP, and OPRT are proteins related to the metabolism of 5-FU, and thus, may influence the effectiveness of S-1. 5-FU, once absorbed by the tumor, is broken down into 2-fluoro-β-alanine by DPD within tumor cells 17 FdUMP forms a ternary complex with reduced folic acid and TS, inhibiting the active TS enzyme, and ultimately DNA synthesis 18 19 This study (JCOG1113A-1) aimed to examine the potential of these candidate markers as appropriate biomarkers for predicting treatment efficacy or prognosis. This is as an ancillary study to JCOG1113, which compared two treatment arms: GC and GS. Methods Patients and study design The JCOG1113 enrolled patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, or ampullary carcinoma. The inclusion criteria and results of the JCOG1113 have been previously reported 8 Chemotherapy GC therapy consisted of a 3-week cycle of chemotherapy with 1,000 mg/m 2 2 2 2 GS therapy is a 3-week cycle chemotherapy with 1,000-mg/m 2 2 2 2 ERCC1 as a candidate marker ERCC1 has been reported as an efficacy marker for CDDP, which is one of the key drugs for unresectable BTC 20 28 24 29 30 22 31 32 Sample collection and evaluation Tumor samples were obtained via biopsy or surgery, and no new samples were collected for this ancillary study. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 3–5-µm-thick tissue sections from blocks in the archives of each institution were used for immunohistochemical staining. One hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained specimen and other tissue sections attached to silane-coated glass slides were prepared at each institution. We used a unified protocol for immunostaining tumor tissue samples for each protein (Supplementary Table S1). Monoclonal antibodies against ERCC1 (4F9; OriGene Technologies, Inc. Rockville, MD, USA), TS (ATYMSMAB; IBL Co. Gunma, Japan), DPD (ADPYDMAB; IBL, ibid.), and TP (ATYMPMAB; IBL, ibid.) were used, and polyclonal antibodies against OPRT (IBL, ibid.) were used. Briefly, for epitope retrieval, tissue specimens were exposed to an antigen retrieval solution and heated in a water bath or autoclave. After epitope retrieval, the tumor specimens were incubated with antibodies specific to each protein at their dilutions. Antibody binding was detected using a ChemMate Envision kit (DAKO) with Mayer’s hematoxylin as the counterstain. For each antibody immunostaining, several tissues were used as positive controls for each antibody. Two authors who were blinded to the clinical data, independently evaluated the staining of each biomarker under a light microscope at 400 × a magnification. If ERCC1 and TP antibodies appropriately stained non-neoplastic vascular endothelial cells, we determined that the tissue condition was acceptable for analysis. Tumor cell numbers exceeding 500 in the surgical specimens and 100 in the biopsy specimens were also considered eligible. Three visual fields were randomly chosen for the surgical specimens, whereas one visual field was selected for the biopsy specimens. The expressions of immuno-labeled molecules in cancer cells were evaluated using a minimum of 100 cells assessed per visual field. The scores for cancer cell staining intensity were as follows: none as 0, weakly stained as 1, moderately stained as 2, and strongly stained as 3. The strongest staining of each external control was evaluated as 3, and no staining was 0. The strength staining in between was divided into two levels and used as the basis for evaluation. (Supplementary Table S1). The proportion of cells according to staining intensity in each observation field was counted, and the ratio was multiplied by the staining intensity to obtain a score. The average values of the scores of the six visual fields for the surgical specimens and the two visual fields for the biopsy specimens of the two authors were calculated and determined as the H score. Images of immunostaining with each antibody are shown in Supplementary Figure S1a–1e. Statistical analysis of associations with clinical data The association between the H-score obtained for each molecular expression and clinical data of OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR) in JCOG1113 was analyzed. The participants were randomly divided into training and test sets in a 2:1 ratio stratified by treatment arm, primary tumor site, and primary tumor resection. In the training set, the p p OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals. A log-linear model was used to estimate the risk ratio and confidence interval for the ORR. Multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox proportional-hazards model with adjustments for age, sex, PS, primary site, biliary drainage, and unresectable status (local progression, distant metastasis, and postoperative recurrence) as prognostic factors for BTC to estimate the hazard ratio of survival for ERCC1 low to high expression. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 or later versions. Ethics approval The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Center (ID: 2013–141) and each participating institution. Results Patients’ characteristics Among the 354 patients who participated in JCOG1113, 183 were enrolled in the ancillary study. The tissue samples for this study were available from 148 patients since immunostaining could not be performed in 24 patients who consented to the study owing to low specimen volumes, and 11 patients’ tissue sample condition did not meet the evaluation criteria (Fig. 1 1 1 Fig. 1 Flowchart of this study from recruitment to the enrollment of the final set of participants.

In the analysis of the combined (GC arm + GS arm) cohort, OS was significantly poorer and PFS tended to be poorer in the high ERCC1 group than in the low ERCC1 group in the training set (Fig. 3 p 3 p 3 3 p 3 p 3 Fig. 3 Kaplan–Meier survival curves of overall survival and progression-free survival for patients with ERCC1 in a combined (GC arm + GS arm) cohort in the training ( A B In multivariate analysis, the HR of OS for ERCC1 low to high expression was 1.863 (95% CI (0.940, 3.693); p p p p TS, DPD, TP, and OPRT In the analysis of TS, DPD, TP, and OPRT, neither a clear interaction between the treatment arms nor prognostic significance in the combined (GC arm + GS arm) cohort was observed regarding OS, PFS, and ORR (Table 3 Trends in results of postoperative or unresectable and surgical or biopsy Trends were compared according to postoperative recurrence or initial unresectable status according to surgical or biopsy specimens. In the biopsy specimen cohort, patients with high DPD expression tumors tended to have a better prognosis (HR of OS, 2.167; 95% CI, 0.614–7.643; p p Discussion This was an ancillary study in a high-quality context with a well-designed randomized phase III trial (JCOG1113: FUGA-BT), including platinum and fluoropyrimidine in each arm for advanced BTC. The immunohistochemical staining intensity in this ancillary study was evaluated by two independent physicians, and the cutoff values were set based on the smallest p We attempted to identify predictive markers for the efficacy of chemotherapy in BTC; however, the five candidate markers used in this study did not produce as many results as expected. Patients with high ERCC1 expression had significantly shorter survival than their counterparts. Furthermore, PFS in the training and test sets tended to be shorter in the high ERCC1 group. Multivariate analysis also suggested a trend toward shorter survival in the high ERCC1 expression group. However, the positivity rate for ERCC1 was low in the training and test sets, with some differences. Since the cases were randomly grouped into a training set and a test set, there appears to be no difference in specimen quality. Furthermore, although there are slight differences in background factors between the two sets, the relation between the differences in biliary tract cancer background and the expression of ERCC1 remains unknown and warrants investigations in a larger number of cases. The role of ERCC1 in BTCs has been well documented. Some studies have investigated performance as a predictor of the treatment effect of GEM 31 33 32 34 31 35 36 24 One possible reason is that ERCC1 may affect the efficacy of GEM by interfering with DNA synthesis 25 37 38 39 41 42 43 38 44 45 The correlation between immunostaining and quantitative mRNA analysis of ERCC1 protein expression in BTC remains unknown. Some reports on other cancer types have shown a correlation between IHC and mRNA to evaluate protein expression 38 46 49 50 Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the protein expression via immunostaining. As 5-FU is the drug of origin for S-1 development, we investigated the expression of TS, DPD, TP, and OPRT, which are included in the metabolic pathway of 5-FU; however, we could not show that these proteins are predictors of S-1 drug efficacy or prognostic factors for advanced BTC. Several studies have examined the association of these proteins with the prediction of the efficacy of S-1 or prognosis; however, their evaluation is not consistent. Clear evidence that the expression of these proteins in tumors can predict response to 5-FU-based regimens in cancers other than BTC is lacking, and so are criteria for evaluation by immunohistochemistry 51 57 58 Nevertheless, in the DPD and OPRT groups, the difference in the numbers of high- and low-expression groups was extremely wide. In DPD, there were only six high-expression groups versus 90 low-expression groups in the training set; likewise, there were only four high-expression groups versus 48 low-expression groups in the test set. In the OPRT, the high-expression group was more numerous (88), than the low-expression groups (8), in the training set; similarly, there were 51 high-expression groups versus one low-expression group in the test set. Herein, the cut-off values for each biomarker were strictly and objectively set; however, this might have resulted in a large bias in the number of positive and negative cases, leading to a lack of power. In this study, the biopsy and surgical specimens were collectively examined. A study on lung cancer reported that ERCC1 and TS expression, assessed via immunohistochemical staining, was associated with preoperative biopsies and surgical specimens 59 60 This study has some limitations. Owing to limitations in human and material resources, and since we had requested that specimens be sent to us from facilities throughout Japan each time a patient was enrolled in this study, evaluating a large number of specimens at once was not possible. The lack of significant differences may be because the specimen storage period, that is, the time between specimen collection and immunostaining, was different from the case in which we performed immunostaining under the same conditions on different days. However, environmental factors, such as differences in room temperature and time of day, were out of our control. Otherwise, we showed that in the combined (GC arm + GS arm) cohort, OS and PFS were poorer in the high ERCC1 group than in the low ERCC1 group in the training set; however, the duration of chemotherapy treatment and whether second-line chemotherapy was administered were not considered. Several targeted agents for relevant molecular or genetic abnormalities 61 10 11 For unresectable BTC, a triplet regimen combining GC therapy with ICIs, is currently recommendedinternationally as the standard systemic therapy 2 In conclusion, this study suggests that in patients with BTC who received GC or GS therapy, no efficacy marker is identified; however, high ERCC1 expression has been identified as a poor prognostic factor.
