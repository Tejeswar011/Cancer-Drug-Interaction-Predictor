Inclusion required five consecutive CBCTs with vertebrae T1–T10 in view and a visible esophagus. The esophagus was contoured on the planning CT (pCT) and five CBCTs. Standard and esophagus-sparing 25 Gy/5 fraction volumetric-modulated arc therapy plans were simulated for five thoracic targets. In esophagus-sparing plans, the esophageal D0.027cc was limited to 8 Gy equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (α/β = 3 Gy), consistent with the ESO-SPARE constraint. CBCT-based esophagus contours were rigidly transferred to the pCT after bony matching. Esophageal metrics (Mean, D0.027cc–D5cc, V8.5 Gy) were extracted from the original plan and compared across CBCT and pCT contours and between plan types. Inter-fraction motion was assessed using 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD). CBCT quality was evaluated in two patients (five targets) using Dice similarity coefficients and interobserver 95% HDs. Results Twelve patients with 23 targets were simulated. Inter-fraction motion led to dose constraint violations in 20 of 23 plans, though only small esophageal volumes entered the high-dose region. Dice scores > 0.8 confirmed good esophageal visibility on CBCT. Most 95% HDs fell within interobserver variability, indicating motion was comparable to contouring uncertainty. Interpretation Despite constraint violations, high-dose exposure was limited to small esophageal volumes, and overall sparing was preserved.

The dosimetric impact of esophageal inter-fraction motion is quantified using consecutive daily high-quality CBCTs. Patients/material and methods Patient selection Patients who underwent thoracic palliative RT on HyperSight-equipped units between September 2023 and December 2024 were screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were treatment in free breathing, ≥ five fractions, and ≥ five consecutive CBCTs available with any of the thoracic vertebrae T1–T10 in the field of view. Finally, the image quality of the CBCT should allow for manual esophagus segmentation. This study received approval from the Danish data regulatory authorities, and all patients provided informed consent for the use of their data in clinical research. Image acquisition Planning CT scans (pCT) acquired with a 2 mm slice thickness were available in Eclipse (Varian, a Siemens Healthineers Company). For each patient, five consecutive CBCT scans were exported to Eclipse from the Ethos planning system (Varian, a Siemens Healthineers Company). Contouring Simulated spinal targets corresponding to vertebral levels T1–2, T3–4, T5–6, T7–8, and T9–T10 were delineated on the pCT. Targets spanning two vertebral levels were selected, as this represented the most common target volume in the ESO-SPARE trial. According to our local guidelines, the clinical target volume (CTV) for spinal metastases includes the vertebral body, spinal canal, and vertebral arch. The spinous and transverse processes were only included if there was evidence of disease. An isotropic 5 mm planning target volume (PTV) margin was added to the CTV. A junior physician, supervised by a senior clinical oncologist, delineated the esophagus on the pCT ( P CBCT fx1–5 Treatment planning The simulated prescribed dose was 25 Gy in 5 fractions (25 Gy/5 fx) to ≥ 90% of the PTV. This fractionation regimen was the most used in the ESO-SPARE trial and was therefore chosen for the current simulation study. For each included target, two VMAT plans were created: a standard plan where the esophagus was not included in the optimization and an esophagus-sparing plan. In the esophagus-sparing plans, the near max dose D 0.027cc Supplementary Figure 1 Data extraction and analysis CBCT-based esophagus structures CBCT images were registered to the pCT using bony matching within the PTV, and each of the five esophageal contours ( CBCT fx1–5 For each CBCT-based esophagus structure, the dose was extracted from the original VMAT plan. Importantly, this extracted dose represents the hypothetical dose that the CBCT esophagus would have received had it remained stationary in that position throughout the entire treatment course, meaning that each fraction’s dose constitutes a worst-case scenario. By averaging these fraction-specific doses, we derive an estimate of the delivered dose that accounts for inter-fraction motion in each treatment plan. For example, using the D0.027cc metric, the estimated delivered dose is calculated as follows: delivered fx1 fx2 fx3 fx4 fx5 To address our hypothesis, we aimed to evaluate the number of plans in which protocol-prescribed esophageal constraint was violated due to esophagus inter-fraction motion. Specifically, we assessed the number of patients with a delivered The dosimetric impact of esophageal inter-fraction motion was further assessed by comparing the delivered and planned dose to selected esophageal volumes – D0.027cc (Gy), D0.5cc (Gy), D1cc (Gy), D2cc (Gy), and esophageal mean dose. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for all dosimetric comparisons. A p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Inter-fraction motion analysis We used the bidirectional 95% Hausdorff Distance (95% HD) to measure esophagus inter-fraction motion between each CBCT esophagus contour and the pCT esophagus. For every point on the evaluated contour, the distance to the nearest point on the reference contour was computed. The 95% HD is defined as the 95th percentile of these distances, reducing the influence of outliers. The bidirectional 95% HD considers distances in both directions (CBCT to pCT and pCT to CBCT) and averages them, providing a more balanced assessment of shape variations [ 16 17 Interobserver variation assessment We assessed interobserver variation in esophagus delineation for two reasons. First, to evaluate the visibility of the esophagus on the HyperSight CBCT, with the assumption that poor visibility leads to greater interobserver variation. Second, to estimate the magnitude of delineation uncertainty, which serves as a reference for evaluating esophageal inter-fraction motion. From the included patients, two were randomly selected and used to evaluate interobserver variation. In these patients, the esophagus was delineated independently by two physicians on both the pCTs and CBCTs. Structures were compared by Dice similarity coefficient and 95%HD [ 18 Statistical analysis was conducted using R, version 4.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Figure 1 Figure 1 Methods. Panel A shows a schematic overview of the simulated target levels and corresponding esophageal segments. A total of 12 patients and 23 targets were included: five targets each at T1–2, T3–4, T5–6, and T7–8, and three at T9–10. Panels B and C outline the contouring and treatment planning workflow, inter-fraction motion analysis, and dosimetric evaluation. Results Patients Twelve patients with 23 simulated targets were included in the analysis, distributed as follows: five targets at each level T1–2, T3–4, T5–6, and T7–8 and three targets at the T9–10 level. Baseline characteristics and target distributions are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 Esophagus inter-fraction motion The distribution of 95%HD across all analyzed fractions and spinal levels is presented in Figure 2 Supplementary Figure 2 A 6.4 mm PRV margin is needed to cover 95% of the observed values. Figure 2 Boxplot of esophagus 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD) across five thoracic metastatic spinal target levels. For spinal levels T1–2, T3–4, T5–6, and T7–8, five targets treated with five fractions each were analyzed. For spinal level T9–10, three targets treated with five fractions each were analyzed. The thick horizontal line represents the median, and the box represents the interquartile range (IQR). The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 and Q3. Individual data points are overlaid as black dots. The shaded area represents the range of 95%HD from interobserver variation analysis. Dosimetric analysis Dosimetric summary of esophagus-sparing and standard plans is provided in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 delivered Figure 3 Figure 3 Boxplot of the absolute dose difference between planned and estimated delivered dose for esophagus dose metrics: D0.027cc, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, and D5cc. The thick horizontal line represents the median; the box spans the interquartile range (IQR). Whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from the lower (Q1) and upper (Q3) quartiles. Individual data points are overlaid as black dots. Notably, changes greater than 4 Gy were observed only in D0.027cc, D0.5cc, and D1cc, suggesting that only a small portion of the esophagus shifted into the high-dose region. This was further supported by the low CBCT esophagus volumes receiving more than 8.5 Gy and visual inspection of dose distributions in cases where constraints were violated, see Figure 4 Supplementary Figure 3 Figure 5 Supplementary Figures 1 and 3 Supplementary Figure 4 Supplementary Table 5 Figure 4 Comparison of CBCT esophagus V8.5 Gy – the volume of the esophagus (cc) receiving more than 8.5 Gy – between esophagus-sparing and standard plans. Each box represents data from 23 simulated 25 Gy/5-fraction plans, where esophagus V8.5 Gy is averaged over five fractions. The thick horizontal line represents the median, while the box indicates the interquartile range (IQR). Whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 and Q3. Individual datapoints are shown as black dots. The difference in dose metrics was statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p < 0.001). CBCT: cone beam computed tomography. Figure 5 Panel A shows the estimated delivered dose to selected esophageal sub-volumes (D0.027cc, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, and D5cc) for both esophagus-sparing and standard radiotherapy plans. Panel B displays the coverage of the clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) for the same plan types, illustrating a tradeoff in target coverage. Each box represents data from 23 simulated treatment plans. The thick horizontal line indicates the median; the box spans the interquartile range (IQR), and the whiskers extend to the furthest data points within 1.5 × IQR from the first and third quartiles. Individual data points are shown as black dots. A dashed horizontal line marks 8.5 Gy – the protocol-defined dose constraint for esophageal D0.027cc. For all dose and coverage metrics, the difference between the two plan types was statistically significant (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.001). Discussion and conclusion In this simulation study of esophagus-sparing RT for complicated spinal metastases, esophagus inter-fraction motion led to the violation of protocol-prescribed esophagus constraint in 20 of 23 simulated plans. However, only a small part of the esophagus moved to the high-dose area, and the overall esophagus sparing-intent was preserved. RT techniques such as IMRT and VMAT enable precise delivery of doses to tumors while minimizing exposure to organs at risk, making the study of organ motion essential for optimal treatment planning. Esophageal inter-fraction motion has been investigated in two main contexts. First, in the treatment of esophageal cancer, the esophagus is the target, and motion analysis is used to determine appropriate margins for tumor coverage [ 9 14 19 5 8 20 Table 1 Table 1 Studies reporting esophagus inter-fraction motion in thoracic radiotherapy other than esophagus cancer.

Four studies used motion-directed metrics for inter-fraction evaluation [ 6 8 20 7 20 7 Esophageal tumor motion during free breathing, as well as inter-fractional motion, has been investigated in esophageal cancer patients using fiducial markers or metal clips for motion tracking [ 9 10 12 14 9 10 12 14 Jin et al. reported estimated margins required to compensate for inter-fractional tumor position in the left–right/cranio–caudal/anterior–posterior directions as follows: 4.4 mm/11.3 mm/5.5 mm for the proximal esophagus, 8.9 mm/8.6 mm/9.6 mm for the middle esophagus, and 6.1 mm/12.1 mm/5.7 mm for the distal esophagus [ 12 5 12 The observed smaller inter-fraction motion in our study may be influenced by patient selection, as patients were specifically chosen based on the visibility of the esophagus on CBCT. This selection may have led to the exclusion of patients with significant organ motion, a known factor that can induce imaging artifacts [ 21 The 95%HD provides an overall measurement of spatial discrepancy between two contours but does not indicate the direction of motion. Since the focus of this manuscript is the dosimetric impact of esophageal inter-fraction motion – information captured through dosimetric analysis – rather than the precise characterization of esophageal movement, it was deemed reasonable to use a motion metric that does not provide directional information [ 16 6 19 Two studies analyzed esophageal inter-fraction motion in patients with clinical data [ 6 20 6 20 8 Palliative spinal irradiation is typically delivered using simple RT techniques, with doses ranging from 8 to 30 Gy over 1–10 fractions [ 1 22 4 2 4 23 2 23 4 In studies of esophageal motion, poor visibility of the esophagus on CBCT necessitates the use of additional techniques to enhance visibility [ 5 7 5 The limitations of this study include the previously mentioned selection bias, a small number of patients, a small number of delineating physicians, and targets for interobserver analysis. Furthermore, some patients had multiple simulated targets, for which esophagus motion and image quality would be inherently correlated. Finally, an optimal analysis would have included patients treated within the ESO-SPARE trial, enabling a direct correlation between esophageal motion and clinical outcomes. However, this was not feasible due to logistical constraints: patients requiring adaptive RT were prioritized for treatment on the HyperSight equipped units, and only four of the patients included in this study were enrolled in the ESO-SPARE clinical trial. Under the updated ESTRO guidelines, single-fraction RT is now the recommended standard for complicated spinal metastases [ 1 24 25 26 Conclusion In this simulation study of esophagus-sparing RT for MSCC, esophageal inter-fraction motion led to violations of the protocol-prescribed esophagus constraints in 20 out of 23 plans. However, only a small portion of the esophagus entered the high-dose area, and the overall esophagus-sparing intent was maintained.
