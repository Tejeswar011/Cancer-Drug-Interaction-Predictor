PDF is calculated directly from an individual’s absolute food intake and PDS is an aggregated score based on an individual’s food intake relative to a population. Both are inversely associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality, coronary events and cancer. Here, for the first time, both measures are calculated in the same population and compared in a post hoc data analysis of a two-year-long randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining effects of lifestyle changes on waist circumference. Methods Seventy-three participants with increased waist circumference and at least one additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease were randomized to a diet based on current dietary guidelines with or without grains and with or without physical exercise or controls. Of these, this post hoc analysis included the 57 participants (36 women and 21 men, aged 31–79 years) who completed the study per protocol with dietary data. Mean daily PDF and PDS were calculated using four-day weighed food records at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Correlations between PDF and PDS, and their respective associations with cardiometabolic outcomes were examined. Results The mean daily PDF for energy at baseline, 12, and 24 months was 36%, 44%, and 42%, respectively. The absolute values of PDF and PDS, and their relative changes, demonstrated moderate to strong correlations during the study ( r s ​( p Conclusions There were moderate to strong correlations between PDF and PDS and no associations between PDF or PDS and cardiometabolic outcome measures, with the latter result possibly due to only modest changes in diet and an absence of outcome effects.

(2014), has been estimated in prospective cohort diet studies [ 6 7 13 14 17 18 6 1  Table 1 Constituents and construction of Paleolithic Diet Fraction and Paleolithic Diet Score Paleolithic Diet Fraction Paleolithic Diet Score Intake Category Scoring Components  Paleolithic food groups Vegetables Fruits Potatoes Egg Meat Fish, shellfish Water Highest intake “best” No. of points assigned to each quintile = quintile rank (e.g., highest and lowest quintiles scored + 5 and + 1 points, respectively) Vegetables Fruits Fruit and vegetable Diversity a Lean meats b Fish Nuts Calcium c  Non-Paleolithic food groups Meat products Cereal grains Rice Legumes Dairy foods Oil, butter, fat Soup, sauce, filling salad Candy, snacks, ice cream, soda Jam Spirits Wine Beer Sugar-sweetened beverages Juice Tea, Coffee Lowest intake “best” No. of points assigned to each quintile = reverse quintile rank (e.g., highest and lowest quintiles scored + 1 and + 5 points, respectively) Red and processed meat d Sodium Dairy foods Grains and starches Baked goods e Sugar-sweetened beverages Alcohol Note a b c d e The REGARDS study, including 21,423 participants from all contiguous 48 U.S. states aged ≥ 45 years (mean age 66 years (SD 9 years), 56% women) [ 7 13 PDF and PDS have never been calculated within the same population, making it unclear how these different measures of how closely a diet conforms to a Paleolithic diet pattern relate to each other. Hypothetically, there should be a correlation between the two measures and a similarity of association with changes in cardiometabolic outcomes. The aim of this study is to calculate both PDF and PDS in the same population and estimate their correlation with each other and their association with cardiometabolic outcomes in a post hoc data analysis of a two-year-long randomized controlled trial of 73 participants (47 women and 26 men aged 23–79 years), examining effects on waist circumference of a diet based on the Swedish Food Agency’s dietary guidelines with or without cereal grains and with or without physical exercise [ 19 19 19 Materials and methods The study protocol (LU 2010/332) was approved by the Regional Ethical Board in Lund. All participants gave written informed consent. Study design and population The participants of this two-year-long RCT with a factorial design were adult individuals belonging to a public Swedish primary health care center in the university town of Lund, Sweden, with increased waist circumference and at least one additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to eat a healthy diet based on the Swedish Food Agency’s dietary guidelines for people affected by overweight or obesity with or without grains and with or without physical exercise, or to a control group with follow-up only [ 19 19 1  Fig. 1 CONSORT flow diagram of participants The primary outcome was waist circumference, and secondary outcomes were body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, and HbA1c, all measured at baseline and after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Standing height was only measured at baseline. Body fat percentage, subcutaneous fat, physical activity, food intake, and change in medication for diabetes and hypertension were all measured and recorded at baseline and after 12 and 24 months. Food intake was assessed using four-day weighed food records filled out by the participants during the study. Participants were instructed to weigh all food items using a tare-enabled electronic kitchen scale. When weighing was not possible, quantities were estimated using alternative units (e.g., deciliters, tablespoons, teaspoons, or centimeters). Although less precise, these estimates represent a minor limitation, as most items were weighed, and remaining entries were converted to grams by YG, who has extensive experience in translating food records. Nutrient intake was calculated based on the reported food intakes using the contemporary Food Database of the Swedish Food Agency [ 20 PDF and PDS PDFs for energy and weight were calculated from the reported food intake as the fraction between the mean daily intake of Paleolithic food groups and the mean daily intake of all food groups (Table 1 6 1 Statistical analysis The SPSS statistical computer package (version 29.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. Data normality was assessed with Normal Q-Q plot and Shapiro-Wilk test. Groups were compared using the X 2 post hoc 2 p Results Baseline characteristics of the 57 participants included in this post hoc analysis, PDF for energy and weight, PDS and cardiometabolic outcomes

Note. p There were no significant associations between absolute or relative change for PDS or PDF for energy and weight and relative change of cardiometabolic outcomes ( p = Discussion We found moderate to strong correlations between PDF and PDS, indicating their comparability [ 21 22 6 7 10 14 16 9 9 16 9 16 8 No significant associations were observed between changes in PDS, PDF (for energy and weight), and relative changes in cardiometabolic outcomes throughout the study. These findings align with the original study, which similarly reported no significant associations between dietary interventions and outcomes. Factors such as a small sample size and high variability in outcomes may have contributed to the lack of significant associations with cardiometabolic changes. Further, the absolute differences in PDF units between dietary interventions were small (0–9%) at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months, in contrast to previous studies that reported larger differences (27–44%) between the Paleolithic, Mediterranean-like, and diabetes diet interventions [ 9 16 The absolute and relative changes in PDF were greater than those in PDS across all groups during the study. These findings suggest that PDF might be a more sensitive measure than PDS for evaluating dietary changes, at least when the dietary changes are of the order of magnitude as in this study. Still, the PDFs for the dietary intervention ‘no grain’ were 43–57% and markedly lower compared to the PDFs for a Paleolithic diet in previous studies, which were 77–86% [ 9 16 9 16 19 19 Although the PDF for energy was only 40%, the PDFs for most micronutrients exceeded 50%, with the highest percentages observed for vitamin B12, vitamin C, and beta-carotene. These findings align with previous research and suggest a relatively high micronutrient density in the Paleolithic diet [ 1 10 24 3 10 23 5 The mean PDF at baseline was 36% for energy, and 45% for weight (Table 2 9 24 10 8 Strengths The strengths of this study include its longer duration and larger sample size compared to previous dietary intervention studies on the PDF [ 8 9 24 20 Limitations A key limitation of the study is that PDS was calculated using four-day weighed food records rather than a food frequency questionnaire, which reduces comparability with previous research. The lack of significant associations between PDS or PDF and cardiometabolic outcomes was likely influenced by insufficient participant recruitment and an underestimation of variability in outcome changes, as previously surmised [ 19 Future research Future research should explore comparisons between PDF and other established diet-quality indices, such as the Mediterranean Diet Score, in large-scale cohort studies. Such comparative analyses are important for determining their relative contributions to cardiometabolic health. Moreover, future studies should aim to include larger sample sizes and design dietary interventions that cause more pronounced changes in PDF, enabling a more accurate evaluation of its associations with glucometabolic outcomes. Moreover, PDF could be applied directly in dietary intervention studies. Participants could be instructed to modify their diets to achieve predefined PDF targets, allowing evaluation of both the methods of dietary adaptation and the resulting health impacts. Such research could offer insights into the practicality and effectiveness of utilizing PDF as a framework for dietary recommendations and its potential role in future dietary guidelines. Conclusion There were moderate to strong correlations between PDF and PDS and no associations between PDF or PDS and cardiometabolic outcome measures, with the latter result possibly due to only modest changes in diet and an absence of outcome effects.
