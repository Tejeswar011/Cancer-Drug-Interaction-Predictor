High response rates have been achieved with boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in the treatment of locally recurrent HN cancer. Radiation-induced oral mucositis (OM) is a common adverse effect of BNCT. We evaluated the factors associated with severe OM in patients treated with BNCT. Patient/material and methods Ninety two patients with locally recurrent inoperable HN cancer were treated with nuclear reactor-based BNCT in 1–2 fractions. The association between grade 3 OM, patient clinical parameters and maximum weighted oral mucosa dose was evaluated. Mucosal dose was calculated using the skin nitrogen concentration of 4.2%. A sigmoidal normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model was created by dividing patients into four equal sized groups based on increasing dose levels. Results Grade 3 OM was observed in 42% of patients after the first BNCT treatment. The prevalence of OM increased with higher maximum oral mucosa doses. From the NTCP curve, we estimated the dose corresponding to a 50% probability (D 50 Interpretation Higher maximum oral mucosa doses increased the risk of grade 3 OM. Older age was the only other factor related to severe OM.

Approximately 2/3 of patients present with stage III or IV disease, and the locoregional recurrence rate in advanced cases varies 15–50%, typically occurring within 2 years of primary treatment [ 1 2 3 5 6 7 Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has shown high response rates (58–81%) in clinical studies of locally recurrent HN cancer [ 8 13 10 4 2+ 7 14 15 In a phase I/II trial at the Finnish FiR 1 research reactor, 76% of patients responded to BNCT and 54% developed grade 3 oral mucositis (OM) [ 9 11 16 Patients/material and methods Study design and objectives This is a retrospective study of HN cancer patients treated at the FiR 1 reactor during years 2003–2012 [ 9 11 16 Patients A total of 102 patients with histologically confirmed, locally recurrent, inoperable HN cancer, without distant metastases and no available effective standard treatment, were treated with BNCT with the intent of local control. Of these, 92 patients were included in the study, 10 were excluded due to early death ( n n Table 1 3 3 Table 1 Patient characteristics.

Treatment planning For contouring, planning computed tomography (CT) was co-registered with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic-resonance images (MRI) and optional 18 The elemental compositions of tissues were defined according to the International Commission on Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) Report 46 [ 17 3 The dose weighted with relative biological effectiveness (D W i 18 W D W = w B D B + w g D g + w N D N + w fast_n D fast_n (1) where D B g N fast_n Weighting factors were 1 for gamma, 3.2 for nitrogen capture and fast neutrons and 3.8 and 2.5 for boron in tumor and mucosa, respectively [ 19 16 The dose to the mucosal membrane was one of the dose-limiting factors in BNCT, restricted to 6 Gy or less per treatment, corresponding to approximately 13.5 Gy(W). Tumor dose varied according to safety limits of normal tissues. Mucosal membrane was not contoured in the treatment planning process. Instead, the maximum dose was visually estimated based on the isodose contours calculated on CT images. Additionally, the maximum weighted dose to the oral mucosa was calculated. As the elemental composition of oral mucosa is not well-established, the dose was estimated using the nitrogen concentration of skin tissue ( N 20 Treatment The patients were scheduled to receive two BNCT treatments at 3–5 weeks intervals, and 52% completed both. Irradiation was performed using the 250 kW FiR TRIGA Mark II reactor (General Atomics, San Diego, CA), located in Espoo, Finland. L-BPA was manufactured by Interpharma Praha (Prague, Czech Republic). Patients received a 2-hour intravenous infusion of L-BPA at 400 mg/kg. Blood samples were taken before the start of L-BPA infusion, at approximately 20-minute intervals during and after the infusion, and after irradiation of each field. Blood boron concentration was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Average boron concentration during irradiation was based on the estimation of pharmacokinetic models [ 21 Irradiation began approximately 1.5 hours after completing the L-BPA infusion. It was delivered via one to three fields, typically two opposing lateral or anterior-lateral circularly collimated fields. Patients received cetirizine hydrochloride 10 mg before L-BPA infusion. Dexamethasone 10–15 mg was administered daily after completion of the infusion to prevent radiation-associated edema and was tapered over 3–4 weeks. Follow up and evaluation of OM Trial patients had a follow-up visit 1 month after BNCT treatment, then every 12 weeks. Patients treated outside of the trial did not have a specific follow-up schedule. OM data in this study were obtained within 1 month after the first treatment. If the patients underwent two BNCT treatments, only the OM status after the initial treatment was evaluated. OM is defined as inflammation and ulceration of oral mucosal membranes. OM was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity 3.0 criteria (NCICT 3.0), where grade 3 is defined as confluent ulcerations or pseudomembranes with bleeding with minor trauma. Statistical analysis Association between grade 3 OM and patient characteristics and treatment-related parameters was analyzed using binary logistic regression (IBM SPSS Statistics,Version: 29.0.0.0(241)). The relationship between grade 3 OM and age, and grade 3 OM and the maximum oral mucosa dose, were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test. Statistical significance was set at p A sigmoidal normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model was created by dividing the patients into four groups ( n NTCP= 1 1+ ( D 50 D ) k (2) where D is the maximum mucosal dose, D 50 Results Among 92 patients, 15% had no OM, 15% developed grade 1, 27% grade 2 and 42% grade 3 OM. No grade 4 or 5 events occurred.

This may be biased by a relatively large irradiated volume (2–3 fields with 11 or 14cm apertures), including nearly entire oral cavity in most cases to reach dose coverage within large GTVs [ 24 The prevalence of grade 3 OM was higher among the elderly patients, although the difference was modest. There is no strong evidence in literature regarding the relationship between older age and radiation-induced OM. It is possible that aging can cause slower tissue healing [ 25 26 Severe OM is common in HN radiotherapy (up to 66%) [ 25 Study limitations This retrospective study has several limitations. Patient heterogeneity and lack of detailed smoking and alcohol history limited risk factor analysis. The SERA system is no longer available for resegmentation or calculations. The FiR 1 beam model is not available in the current TPS. Due to relatively large irradiation fields, the dose distribution across the mucosal surfaces was fairly homogeneous. Therefore, the primary source of uncertainty might not be the variability in physical dose, but rather the distribution of boron. Average boron concentrations were only available for dose estimation. Although detailed contouring of the mucosal structures was not performed, mucosal dose was evaluated following standard clinical practice. Conclusions Higher maximum oral mucosa doses were associated with an increased risk of grade 3 OM. Older age was the only other risk factor related to severe OM.
