While previous studies have reported sporadic cases, the true frequency and drug-specific associations remain unclear. This study evaluates the association between oral bowel cleansers and IC using real-world pharmacovigilance data. Methods We conducted a disproportionality analysis using 20 years of data (2004–2024) from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). IC cases linked to bisacodyl, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and oral sulfate solution (OSS) were identified. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to explore factors associated with IC and serious clinical outcomes. Results Among 43,958 adverse event reports related to bowel cleansers, 75 cases of IC were identified. Bisacodyl showed the strongest disproportionality signal for IC (reporting odds ratio (ROR) = 237.25), with a reporting proportion of 7.9%, followed by PEG (ROR = 2.18) and OSS (ROR = 3.64). Older age (≥70 years) and cardiovascular comorbidities were associated with more severe outcomes, such as hospitalization and death. Notably, reports of IC associated with PEG included six fatal and three life-threatening events. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is one of the largest pharmacovigilance analyses exploring ischemic colitis associated with bowel preparation agents. The findings raise concerns about the presumed safety of PEG and reveal a strong disproportionality signal for bisacodyl. These results highlight the need for individualized bowel preparation strategies, especially in elderly patients with comorbidities.

Introduction Ischemic colitis (IC) is an inflammatory condition associated with insufficient colonic blood supply. While its overall reporting portion is estimated at 17.7–22.9 per 100,000 individuals annually, its prevalence is significantly higher among the elderly and those with cardiovascular comorbidities [ 1 3 Bowel cleansers are commonly administered before colonoscopy, surgery, and imaging procedures to ensure optimal examination conditions. IC as a complication of bowel preparation for colonoscopy has been increasingly recognized [ 4 5 6 Previous studies have primarily focused on single-center retrospective analyses [ 4 2. Materials and methods 2.1 Data extraction and processing The ASCII (The American Standard Code for Information Interchange) report files from January 2004 to September 2024 (publicly accessible at FAERS Latest Quarterly Data Files The data standardization procedures adhered to FDA guidelines for duplicate removal and quality control. Key identifier fields (PRIMARYID, CASEID, FDA_DT) were extracted from the demographic dataset and prioritized as follows: (1) Records with identical CASEIDs were filtered to retain those with the most recent FDA_DT timestamp; (2) If multiple entries had matching CASEID-FDA_DT combinations, the record with the highest PRIMARYID value was preserved. The complete methodological workflow is illustrated in Fig 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0332345.g001 Fig 1 Flowchart. 2.2 Study population selection criteria Pharmacological agents were categorized based on their potential etiological contribution to adverse events (AEs), comprising four distinct classifications: primary suspect (PS), secondary suspect (SS), concomitant (C), and interacting medications (I). In the initial analysis, only cases involving primary suspect drugs were included due to their stronger pharmacovigilance signal. The remaining classifications were excluded from primary analysis due to their diminished causal probability and increased uncertainty in adverse event attribution, though concomitant medications were retained for subsequent stratified analyses. Drug identification was performed through systematic nomenclature verification, utilizing both brand and generic names cross-referenced against authoritative sources including with data of Drugs@FDA, Drugbank [ 7 8 S1 Table Cases were selected only from reports listing IC as the primary adverse event. In the FAERS database, AEs are coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 26.2). Preferred terms (PTs) are used to describe specific AEs. System Organ Classes (SOCs), the highest level in MedDRA, categorize medical conditions by organ system or function. In this study, the SOC code is 10017947, with detailed PT codes listed in S2 Table 2.3 Disproportionality analysis The disproportionality analysis was conducted using a 2 × 2 contingency tables ( Table 1 9 10 11 12 13 10.1371/journal.pone.0332345.t001 Table 1 2 × 2 contingency table for disproportionality analysis.

As such, this study is exempt from institutional review board (IRB) approval in accordance with relevant ethical guidelines and PLOS ONE policies. 3. Results 3.1 Clinical features of cases This study analyzed 43,958 adverse event reports related to bowel cleansers, identifying 75 cases of IC. The mean age of affected patients was 66.1 ± 12.5 years, with 64.0% being female. The average age at onset was 64.9 ± 11.8 years for females and 66.0 ± 14.0 years for males. Females outnumbered males in all age groups from 40 to 80 years. There was no significant age distribution difference between genders, either within subgroups (p = 0.335) or overall (p = 0.731).

Fatal outcomes and life-threatening events were less frequent, occurring in 8.0% and 4.0% of cases, respectively ( Fig 2B Most reports (81.1%) were submitted by healthcare professionals, while non-healthcare reporters (e.g., consumers or lawyers) accounted for 10.6% ( Fig 2C Geographically, the majority of reports originated from the United States (49.3%) and Japan (29.3%), with additional cases from France, India, and the United Kingdom. A small number of reports did not specify the source country ( Fig 2D 3.2 Reporting trends Since 2004, the reporting trends of IC cases showed two distinct peaks: a primary peak in 2007 and a secondary peak in 2017 ( Fig 3A Fig 3B Fig 3C Fig 3D 10.1371/journal.pone.0332345.g003 Fig 3 Annual case count. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) The median annual reporting proportion for all drugs was 0.13%, with bisacodyl showing the highest reporting proportion (7.90%), followed by PEG (0.07%) and OSS, which had the lowest observed reporting proportion (<0.01%). Detailed data are provided in Fig 3 S4 Table Most cases originated from northern hemisphere countries, with seasonal distribution defined as spring (March–May), summer (June–August), autumn (September–November), and winter (December–February). Among the reported IC cases, 36.17% occurred in autumn, 25.5% in winter, 23.4% in spring, and 14.9% in summer. Despite these numerical differences, seasonal variation was not statistically significant ( Fig 3E S5 Table 3.3 Association of medications with IC Disproportionality analyses consistently showed a strong association between bowel cleansers and IC (ROR: 1136.7, PRR: 890.79, IC025: 9.43, EBGM05: 715.68). Among the three agents, bisacodyl exhibited the strongest link to IC, with ROR of 237.25 (95% CI: 159.72–352.44), PRR of 224.32 (95% CI: 223.95–224.7), IC (IC 025 Table 4 10.1371/journal.pone.0332345.t004 Table 4 Disproportionality analysis.

For PEG, the most common adverse events were related to medication use issues, with “Product Use Issue” being the most frequently reported PT (n = 9205; ROR: 43.12; 95% CI: 42.17–44.09). The highest ROR for PEG was observed for “Incorrect Product Administration Duration” (n = 1911, ROR: 80.6; 95% CI: 76.82–84.57). OSS was most frequently associated with “Vomiting” (n = 752, ROR: 19.91; 95% CI: 18.44–21.51).

Although males had a 20% higher OR for IC compared to females in univariate analysis (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.95–1.50, P = 0.12) and a similar trend in multivariate analysis (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.90–1.45, P = 0.25), these differences were not statistically significant. 3.5.2 Age and body weight. Both analyses consistently showed significant associations between IC and age and body weight (P < 0.05). Adjusted for gender and body weight, each additional year of age increased the odds by 4% (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02–1.06, P < 0.01). Similarly, each additional kilogram of body weight corresponded to a 1% increase in IC association (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.02–1.06, P = 0.02). 3.6 Severe outcomes and risk factors Mortality and life-threatening events were significantly associated with age (P < 0.05), with a notable rise in severe outcomes among individuals aged 70–79.9 years, underscoring advanced age as a key association factor. In contrast, no significant associations were found between gender, body weight, and severe outcomes ( Table 7 10.1371/journal.pone.0332345.t007 Table 7 Logistic regression analysis of mortality and life-threatening outcomes.

Discussion Ischemic colitis is a condition associated with transient or sustained reduction in colonic blood flow, leading to mucosal injury. It typically presents with sudden onset of lower abdominal pain, urgency, and hematochezia within 24 hours of bowel preparation. Mild cases resolve with supportive care, including fluid resuscitation and bowel rest, while severe cases may progress to bowel necrosis, perforation, or strictures, requiring surgical intervention. Prompt diagnosis via abdominal CT and colonoscopy is crucial for early management and prevention of complications [ 2 15 16 Consistent with the literature, our study found that most patients were elderly and female, with an average age of 66.11 years and 64.00% being women. Although IC can occur in younger adults without cardiovascular comorbidities [ 3 Various factors, including medications, can cause IC [ 15 17 16 4 A nationwide survey by Israeli physicians reported 8 cases of bisacodyl-induced IC between 2014 and 2019. All patients experienced abdominal discomfort after taking 10 mg of bisacodyl three days before the examination. Three patients continued with the same dose the following day, along with Picolax (containing 10 mg sodium picosulfate, 3.5 g magnesium oxide light, and 12 g citric acid) [ 6 Current bowel cleansing regimens typically combine bisacodyl tablets with PEG electrolyte solution or oral sulfate solution, with volumes ranging from 1 to 4 liters [ 18 19 20 19 21 Bisacodyl tablets, commonly used as stimulant laxatives in bowel preparation, enhance the cleansing effect of PEG or OSS. The association of bisacodyl-induced IC is dose-dependent. Available in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg doses, the 20 mg dose is more likely to cause abdominal cramping, nausea, and IC compared to the 10 mg dose [ 22 23 24 Our study found that the median reporting proportion of IC associated with all bowel cleansers was 0.13%, slightly higher than the figure reported in the Japanese study mentioned earlier. Among individual agents, bisacodyl had the highest median reporting proportion (7.90%), followed by PEG (0.07%) and OSS, which showed the lowest observed reporting proportion (<0.01%). The reporting proportion of IC with bisacodyl was the highest. Among the 26 cases of bisacodyl-induced IC, 17 involved the use of 20 mg of bisacodyl, further supporting the strong association between high-dose bisacodyl and IC. A study found that bisacodyl enhances bowel cleansing only in ultra-low-volume regimens but increases discomfort in high-association patients, such as those with a history of abdominal surgery or obstipation. In contrast, high-volume (4L) or low-volume (2L) regimens generally provide satisfactory cleansing, and adding bisacodyl did not improve efficacy. Therefore, bisacodyl may be omitted in 2L or 4L regimens to reduce discomfort and the association with IC. The study did not specify the bisacodyl dosage used [ 20 Reports of IC associated with PEG are rare. One case involved a patient developing symptoms after consuming 1L of PEG-ELS [ 5 25 26 21 The mechanism of PEG-induced IC is unclear and may be idiosyncratic. A possible cause is fluid loss leading to dehydration and colonic hypoperfusion [ 5 Oral sulfate solutions were approved for use in Japan and the United States around 2008–2010 [ 27 28 29 30 An observational study found a cumulative incidence of IC of 0.02% for both OSS and PEG, with no significant difference between the two [ 29 31 While sodium phosphate requires less fluid intake and improves patient compliance, it poses a risk of phosphate nephropathy. Furthermore, NaP is not superior to PEG-ELS for bowel preparation, and guidelines do not recommend its routine use [ 18 24 32 Advanced age and higher body weight are commonly linked to an increased incidence of cardiovascular conditions, such as hypertension and coronary heart disease [ 33 Cold weather has been linked to increased cardiovascular events [ 34 In summary, our findings suggest notable associations between bowel preparation agents—particularly bisacodyl—and ischemic colitis, with increased severity observed in elderly patients and those with cardiovascular comorbidities. However, this study has limitations inherent to the FAERS database, including underreporting, reporting bias, and lack of exposure data, which preclude estimation of true incidence or risk. Therefore, the associations observed should not be interpreted as causal. Prospective studies are warranted to validate these signals and better define the safety profiles of bowel preparation agents. Additionally, the classification of combination regimens under the bisacodyl category may introduce confounding, as co-administered agents such as PEG could also contribute to adverse outcomes. In our dataset, PEG monotherapy was associated with the highest number of IC reports. Therefore, the elevated ROR observed in the bisacodyl group may be partly driven by cases involving bisacodyl-PEG co-administration. Furthermore, the combination of bisacodyl and PEG may exert additive effects in provoking ischemic colitis. As a stimulant and an osmotic laxative, respectively, their synergistic action could result in excessive colonic motility, dehydration, and transient mucosal hypoperfusion. This pharmacologic interaction may increase mucosal vulnerability and help explain the disproportionality signal observed. Further studies are warranted to assess the safety of such regimens, particularly in elderly or high-risk individuals. 5. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is one of the largest pharmacovigilance analyses exploring ischemic colitis associated with bowel preparation agents. Leveraging 20 years of FAERS data, we identified strong, drug-specific disproportionality signals: bisacodyl showed the highest reporting proportion of IC among its adverse-event reports and the strongest association with severe outcomes. While previous clinical studies have suggested a low overall association with IC, our findings raise concerns about this assumption, particularly regarding the safety of polyethylene glycol in elderly and high-association patients. The identification of bisacodyl as a major contributor to IC highlights the need for dose-dependent risk stratification in bowel preparation protocols. Given the increasing reliance on colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening, clinicians must reconsider bowel preparation regimens for elderly and cardiovascularly compromised patients. Future prospective studies and regulatory evaluations are needed to reassess the safety guidelines for bowel cleansers.
