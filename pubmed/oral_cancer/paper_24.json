Summary The human microbiota has a critical role in maintaining human microbiome homeostasis and health, yet the viral component of the oral microbiome remains largely unidentified. We establish the Human Oral Virome Database (HOVD) catalog, a freely accessible online resource cataloging 24,440 bacteriophage viral operational taxonomic units and 83 eukaryotic viral genomes. Utilizing HOVD, we investigate oral virome variation and its correlation with oral bacteria and gut virome in 220 obese individuals with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Obese individuals with T2D exhibit reduced oral viral diversity, lower correlations with clinical features, disrupted viral-bacterial correlations, and enhanced oral-gut virome transmission. Furthermore, we computationally identify bacteriophages that infect Porphyromonas gingivalis Porphyromonas gingivalis Graphical abstract Highlights • HOVD catalogs 24,440 phage OTUs and 83 eukaryotic viruses in an online resource • Oral viral diversity decreases in obese T2D individuals, with weaker clinical associations • Oral-gut viral transmission was enhanced in obesity/T2D • Phage-derived endolysins inhibit P. gingivalis Xu et al. establish the Human Oral Virome Database and reveal virome alterations and oral-gut viral transmission in obesity with T2D.

Tisza et al. created the Cenote Human Virome Database (CHVD) including 13,565 oral viruses from over 1,000 oral metagenomic samples. 16 17 5 10 , 18 In addition, oral viruses have been identified as being associated with human diseases, such as oral cancers; periodontal diseases; hand, foot, and mouth disease; and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that oral viruses might influence the progression of these diseases and indicating potential approaches for prognosis and diagnosis based on microbiome composition. 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 25 , 26 27 , 28 , 29 30 , 31 , 32 To expand the existing research and provide a complementary perspective of the human oral virome, we performed a large-scale integration of oral viral genomes from three human oral virome databases previously published and viral genomes identified from 220 oral metagenomes obtained from obese patients with or without T2D. We used these data to establish the Human Oral Virome Database (HOVD) catalog, which contained 24,440 phage viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) made up of the Human Oral Phage Database (OPD) and 83 eukaryotic viral contigs composed of the Human Oral Eukaryotic Virus Database (OED), estimated to be over 50% complete. According to the developed database, we characterized the changes in the oral virome and their correlation with oral bacteria and the gut virome in obese subjects with T2D and explored potential therapeutic strategies for periodontitis individuals with T2D. This study would advance our knowledge of viruses identified in the oral microbiome and host-virus interactions and provide clues for the diagnosis and treatment of these human diseases.

To our knowledge, this is the most unified oral virome database so far. The oral metagenomes were from nine countries across four continents, and we identified 24,440 oral phage operational taxonomic units and 83 oral eukaryotic virus genomes, all with completeness greater than 50%. Through the established human oral virome catalog, we have focused on items involved in the composition and structure of the human oral virome related to clinical factors associated with obesity and T2D and interactions between the human oral virome, the bacteriome, and the gut virome. We identified P. gingivalis P. gingivalis Compared with the oral virome database published previously, 16 , 17 59 P. gingivalis Bacteroides forsythus 60 9 Due to the intimate relationship between chronic diseases and the oral microbiome, 61 62 63 , 64 46 , 65 46 18 Periodontitis might contribute to an increase in the incidence of cases of T2D. Due to the tremendous global burden of diabetes, it was urgent to prevent and treat periodontal disease to mitigate the influence of periodontitis on diabetes and its complications. 66 , 67 68 P. gingivalis 69 P. gingivalis 70 Porphyromonas P. gingivalis 71 , 72 P. gingivalis P. gingivalis P. gingivalis Enhanced phage activity has been suggested to play an important role in the progression of periodontal disease. 73 P. gingivalis P. gingivalis 74 75 , 76 In summary, the established human oral virome catalog integrated the largest number of oral metagenomic samples to date. It included a greater number of high-quality oral viral genomes, distinguished between oral eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages, and provided more detailed labeling of oral sample sources. This advancement broadened our understanding of the human oral virome and uncovered more unknowns related to the functions and potential hosts of oral bacteriophages. Besides, our study provided evidence that obesity with T2D was characterized by decreased oral viral diversity, lower correlations with clinical features, disrupted viral-bacterial interactions, and an enhanced oral-gut virome connection, compared to obese individuals without T2D. We identified potential P. gingivalis P. gingivalis Limitations of the study Although our study has deepened the understanding of the human oral virome and its relevance to the oral bacteriome and gut virome in obese participants with T2D, several limitations still need to be addressed in the future. First, most oral phage genomes could be annotated at the class level, while almost 97% (23,610/24,440) of genomes could not be distinguished at the order level, indicating many unknown aspects of the human oral virome that await exploration. Besides, we did not analyze all the oral metagenomes with iVirP, potentially resulting in insufficient excavation of viral genomes. Also, only approximately 30% of viral genomes could be assigned to bacterial hosts, which reflects the current limitations of host prediction methods arising from incomplete reference databases and the complex nature of virus-host interactions. Furthermore, we did not analyze statistically significant correlations between oral viromes and clinical indices collected. Given the well-established association between type 2 diabetes and periodontitis, more clinical features related to the diagnosis of obesity, diabetes, and periodontitis should be included, and more effective models should be developed to evaluate the correlation between the human oral virome and clinical manifestations. Additionally, limited analysis was performed, including the relationship between the oral bacteriome and virome and between the oral and gut virome. It needs to be further analyzed and discussed, including specific viruses shared by the oral and intestinal microbiota and particularly remarkable alterations in correlations between the gut virome and bacteriome, which might be involved in the development of T2D. 63 , 64 Resource availability Lead contact Further information and requests should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Guanxiang Liang ( guanxiangliang@tsinghua.edu.cn Materials availability All related reagents generated in this study are available from the lead contact Data and code availability  • The authors declared that all the data supporting the findings of this study were available within the article and its supplementary information files or from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Participants in our study were individually informed about the aim and details of research and signed the informed consent. Participants enrollment This study included a total of 220 obese participants, comprising 162 obese patients with T2D [Ob/T2D; females ( n n n n Method details Sample collection Oral saliva and feces samples were collected at the same follow-up. Participants were not allowed to eat, drink, or brush their teeth for 2 h before sampling. Feces were freshly obtained and gathered with specific containers. And unstimulated saliva was taken with drooling into a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube within 15 min. Samples were immediately frozen at 4°C and transferred to the refrigerator at −80°C for DNA extraction. DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing The genomic DNA was extracted from the clinical samples and the concentration and quality of the purified DNA was determined by the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit. The oral and feces samples were sequenced using both metagenomics and 16sRNA, simultaneously. The metagenomic libraries were established using the protocol of the manufacturer (Vazyme, VAHTS Universal DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina, cat. ND607-01). Metagenomic sequencing was performed using whole genome shotgun sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq platform with 150 bp paired-end reads based on the instructions of the manufacturer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). And the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the forward primers containing the sequence “CCTACGGRRBGCASCAGKVRVGAAT” and reverse primers containing the sequence “GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAATCC”. Preprocessing and assembly Raw reads of oral and feces samples were fed to iVirP ( https://github.com/li-bw18/iVirP 33 Human oral viral database collection We collected several studies containing human oral viral genome databases publicly available until November 2023, including Oral Virus Database (OVD), 17 16 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/ st Human oral eukaryotic viruses and phage database identification Based on the taxonomic annotation of viral sequences in the previous database, we distinguished human oral eukaryotic viral and human oral phage databases. The viral sequences identified as unknown were classified into the human oral phage database. In the analysis of phage contigs, 64,802 contigs was extracted and clustered into 60,134. After assessment with CheckV, 29,033 contigs was reserved with >50% genome completeness. All phage genomes were clustered into species-level vOTUs on the basis of 95% average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 85% alignment fraction (AF) of the shorter sequence according to the protocol by Nayfach et al.( https://github.com/snayfach/MGV 35 In the analysis of eukaryotic virus, we kept the contigs between 90% and 150% subject sequence length/query sequence length matched with NT database. Then, 83 eukaryotic viral contigs were identified as human oral eukaryotic virome database. Taxonomic annotation Viral taxonomic annotation was performed using MMSeqs2 (v13.45111). Query databases were created for viral contigs using “mmseqs created”, and annotated by aligning to MMSeqs2 virus protein database (download from https://zenodo.org/records/6574914 Host prediction We used an oral microbial genome catalog containing 3,589 publicly available species-level genome bins by Zhu et al. ( https://db.cngb.org/microbiome/genomecatalog/human_oral/ 37 https://github.com/jessieren/VirHostMatcher d d 36 d Functional annotation and protein clustering 1,364,888 protein-coding genes were identified from all the contigs of the Human oral virus database with Prodigal (v 2.6.3) and were annotated based on HMM searches using protein family databases, including KEGG, 40 41 42 http://vogdb.org 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis Raw sequencing reads of 16S rRNA sequences were qualified and calculated with QIIME2 (v 2021.4). 81 77 Oral, gut virome of obese patients with T2D analysis Alpha and beta diversities were calculated by the diversity and PCoA function with R package vegan (v 2.6-2) and R package ape (v 5.6-2). Data processing was visualized by R package ggplot2 (v 3.4.4), and R package pheatmap (v 1.0.12). Correlations between the oral, gut virome, oral bacterial, and clinical parameters were performed using the Spearman correlation coefficient with R package corrplot (v 0.90). Network diagrams of microbial communities were calculated and visualized by the “Gephi” interactive platform (v 0.9.2). 78 Prediction the contribution of oral virome and bacteriome to the disorder state We applied eXtreme Gradient Boosting (R package xgboost, v 1.7.7.1) method to predict how oral virome and bacteriome might be contribute to the disorder state. We defined the disorder state, including obesity with T2D (represented as “1”) and obesity without T2D (represented as “0”). Clinical parameters contained age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waistline, hipline, monocyte, leukocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-Ch). Every prediction model was trained on a training set (70% of the samples) and tested on a test set (30% of the samples). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were used to quantify the contributions of each feature to the model. The following prediction models were measured: Model 1. Disorder state ∼ clinical parameters; Model 2. Disorder state ∼ clinical parameters + oral viral abundance; Model 3. Disorder state ∼ clinical parameters + oral bacterial abundance; Model 4. Disorder state ∼ all combined.

PCR purified fragments were digested with NdeI and HindIII restriction enzymes and ligated within pET30a vector. After isolation, recombinant plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and introduced into E. coli Protein purification Endolysin were purified using nickel-based immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). E. coli. 600 Endolysin activity assay Porphyromonas gingivalis For the hydrolytic activity assay, Pro.3, Pro.4 and Pro.5 were diluted to 2.5μM and 0.25μM respectively using elution buffer. Then mixed the diluted endolysin with P. gingivalis (1) Group 1: P. gingivalis + (2) Groups 2 & 3: P. gingivalis (3) Groups 4 & 5: P. gingivalis (4) Groups 6 & 7: P. gingivalis (5) Groups 8 & 9: P. gingivalis Buffer was included as negative controls. After incubation, bacterial lysis was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm of the supernatant, reflecting hydrolysis of endolysin on P. gingivalis Quantification and statistical analysis Data were presented as the means ± SE. p Additional resources Human Oral Virome Database (HOVD): https://hovd.example.org References 1 Sepich-Poore G.D.
