This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/399471-subcutaneous-endosalpingiosis-of-the-buttock-without-prior-surgery-or-trauma-a-case-report-and-literature-review Endosalpingiosis is a rare, benign condition characterized by the presence of ectopic glandular epithelium that resembles the epithelium of the fallopian tubes. It typically affects the pelvic peritoneum and is often discovered incidentally. We present a rare case of subcutaneous endosalpingiosis localized in the left buttock of a 49-year-old woman with no history of surgery or trauma in the area. The patient presented with a palpable, painless subcutaneous mass that had been present for over 15 years and caused discomfort while sitting. Imaging and aspiration suggested a cystic lesion, and surgical excision was performed under local anesthesia. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of endosalpingiosis confined to the subcutaneous tissue. This report highlights the clinical and pathological features of this extremely rare presentation and discusses possible pathogenesis with reference to previously published literature. buttock mass endosalpingiosis immunohistochemistry müllerianosis subcutaneous tumor pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Endosalpingiosis is a benign condition characterized by the ectopic presence of fallopian tube-like ciliated epithelium. It is most frequently found on the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, and fallopian tubes and is considered part of the Müllerianosis spectrum, along with endometriosis and endocervicosis [ 1 3 Case presentation A 49-year-old woman was referred to our department for evaluation of a left buttock subcutaneous mass that was first noticed approximately 15 years prior. She reported no associated pain but experienced discomfort while sitting. Her medical history was notable for Graves' disease. She denied any history of trauma or prior surgical procedures in the buttock region. The physical examination revealed a soft, well-circumscribed, and mobile 6-cm subcutaneous nodule on the left buttock (Figure 1 Figure 1 Clinical Findings A subcutaneous tumor approximately 6 cm in size was noted on the left buttock, with a pale bluish discoloration of the overlying skin. Ultrasonography demonstrated a round, hypoechoic lesion without internal vascularity. Fine-needle aspiration yielded clear, serous fluid (Figure 2 Figure 2 Imaging and Cytology (A) Ultrasonography reveals a cystic lesion beneath the dermis. (B) Fine-needle aspiration yields clear, serous fluid. The cyst rapidly reaccumulated fluid following aspiration, prompting surgical excision under local anesthesia. The gross examination showed a well-encapsulated cystic lesion (Figure 3 Figure 3 Intraoperative Findings (A, B) A unilocular cystic lesion with a thin capsule measuring slightly over 4 cm was identified. The inner surface was smooth and contained colorless, transparent serous fluid without solid components. Histopathological analysis revealed cystic structures lined with benign ciliated tubal-type epithelium. Alcian blue staining revealed linear positive findings on the brush border of the cuboidal epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated PAX8 4 Figure 4 Histopathological Findings (A, B) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining: The cyst wall is lined with simple cuboidal epithelium exhibiting cilia and no cytological atypia. Focal luminal projections are present. (C) Alcian blue staining: Linear positivity is observed along the brush border of the epithelial cells. (D, E) PAX8 Discussion Endosalpingiosis was first described by Sampson in 1930 to denote fallopian tube epithelium-like structures observed within scar tissue following salpingectomy [ 1 The pathogenesis of endosalpingiosis is presumed to follow mechanisms similar to other forms of Müllerianosis. This group of conditions constitutes the non-neoplastic disorders of the Müllerian system. Two major theories have been proposed to explain the development of endosalpingiosis. One theory posits that endometrial cells or their precursors are transported via various routes (transtubal, hematogenous, lymphatic, or direct implantation) and become established in ectopic locations [ 4 5 Non-neoplastic glandular proliferations showing spontaneous Müllerian differentiation have been described in various sites, including the vagina, uterine cervix, urinary bladder, appendix, peritoneum, abdominal wall (inguinal canal, umbilicus), and lymph nodes [ 4 6 13 Endosalpingiosis is influenced by hormonal status and, similar to endometriosis, is most frequently observed in premenopausal women. However, it has also been reported in postmenopausal women [ 14 15 11 16 Clinically, although endosalpingiosis may occur in conjunction with hormonal cycles, it differs clinically from endometriosis. It is not typically associated with chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, or infertility [ 16 Histologically, endosalpingiosis is characterized by cystic or glandular structures lined by a single layer of benign cuboidal to columnar epithelium. To confirm the Müllerian origin of the lesion, immunohistochemical staining is essential. Various specific markers have been developed to narrow down the tissue of origin. In our case, we utilized PAX8 PAX8 17 PAX8 18 19 PAX8 Regarding treatment, unlike endometriosis, endosalpingiosis is not typically associated with cyclic pain or tumor growth in response to hormonal fluctuations. Consequently, hormone-based therapies such as oral contraceptives or GnRH agonists are generally considered ineffective [ 11 Conclusions We report an extremely rare case of subcutaneous endosalpingiosis of the buttock in a patient with no surgical or traumatic history. This case expands the known clinical spectrum of endosalpingiosis and underscores the importance of considering it in the differential diagnosis of cystic subcutaneous lesions, even in atypical locations.
