Citronellol is an acyclic monoterpene alcohol with various pharmacological properties. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of citronellol and its nanoformulation on glioblastoma cell proliferation. The physicochemical properties of citronellol and its synthesized silver nanoconjugates (CN@AgNPs) were evaluated using DFT and ADMET studies. The targets of the investigation (p53 and CDK4) were identified through the application of chemogenomics and analysis of the STRING protein-protein interaction network. Ligands were docked to the interaction sites of specific targets using AutoDock Vina 1.5.7. Molecular dynamics were used to mimic the citronellol complex CDK4 and p53. Because metallic bonds, which provide metals with unique strength and stability, are more resilient and long-lasting than hydrogen bonds, the results showed that the CN@AgNPs generated a more stable complex. Citronellol and CN@AgNPs were assessed by an in vitro study to determine the expression of IC 50 50 Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-14557-0.

Two primary proteins, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), regulate cell cycle progression. The cell cycle stops, and mutagenic lesions are unable to spread to daughter cells when DNA damage occurs during the G2/M phase. p53 downregulation of p21 during DNA damage monitors these transitions 9 10 Novel pharmacologically active chemicals used in medicinal treatments are mostly derived from natural products 11 12 13 14 Citronellol, an essential oil, is a monoterpene with a molecular formula of C 10 20 15 16 17 However, it is typically unknown how phytocompounds are bioavailable and processed metabolically, and the blood-brain barrier frequently limits the effectiveness of glioma therapy. The bioavailability and targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs within the bulk of GBM tumors can now be enhanced by loading them onto nanoparticles (NPs) 18 19 20 The difficulty in precisely focusing on the p53/p21 pathway because of factors such as TP53 mutations and CDK4 over-activation highlights the necessity for creative methods to control their activity. In this study, we created citronellol-based nanoconjugates and used a combination of computational and experimental methods to assess their ability to affect TP53 and CDK4. This study aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms behind the therapeutic advantages of these nanoparticles and assess their potential as innovative therapies for glioblastoma. Materials and methods Materials Carboxy methylcellulose (CMC), Citronellol with 95% purity, Silver nitrate (AgNO 3 Ligand retrieval and its nanoformulation An examination of the literature led to the selection of citronellol for the design of a citronellol-silver nanoconjugate (CN@AgNPs). With a few changes, the citronellol-silver nanoconjugate was synthesized according to Ali et al.‘s 20 3 Characterization of Citronellol-based silver nanoconjuagte (CN@AgNps) Particle size (PS) and zeta potential (ZP) measurements The electrostatic potential and average PS of the CN@AgNPs have been described and are useful parameters for stability studies 21 2 22 23 Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectroscopy A Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to evaluate the absorbance of the samples. This confirms the quality of the content. Spectral analysis verified that the CN@AgNps were produced. The visible and ultraviolet spectral bands (200–800 nm) were used to log the CN@AgNPs spectra. Distilled water was used as a reference for baseline adjustment 24 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis To determine chemical bonding, IR spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu FTIR spectrometer. The functional groups that were in charge of the stability and reduction of the biosynthesized AgNPs were identified using FTIR analysis. In this study, wavenumbers ranging from 400 to 4000 cm − 1 25 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement Using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer (Japan), the experimental powder’s purity and crystal structure were evaluated. All scans were performed at room temperature using Cu Kα radiation, which corresponds to λ = 1.056 Å at diffraction angles of 10–70 ° 26 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) An FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 (USA) microscope was used for morphological examination. SEM was used to confirm the size, shape, and crystallinity of CN@AgNPs 27 In Silico Analysis Density functional theory (DFT) studies DFT calculations were performed using a slightly modified version of a previously reported method 28 29 Pharmacokinetic parameters Furthermore, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics of the newly created CN@AgNPs and citronellol were predicted using SwissADME ( http://www.swissadme.ch 30 https://admetmesh.scbdd.com/ 31 StopTox ( https://stoptox.mml.unc.edu/ 32 Compound target predictions for glioblastoma via PIDGIN protocols Following pharmacokinetic prediction, the target of citronellol was predicted using chemogenomics software Pidgin version 2 with the Python command “ predict_per_comp.py input.csv 30 0.5 0.3 “Homo sapiens (Human) 33 34 35 36 37 Validation GeneCards (The Human Gene Database) https://www.genecards.org/ https://www.malacards.org/ 38 38 39 Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network construction and KEGG enrichment analyses Gene function has often been annotated and predicted using protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, assuming that interacting proteins have comparable or equivalent activities and may thus be involved in the same pathways. Similar biological functions are usually carried out by nearby proteins in a PPI network 40 41 To identify pathways related to glioblastoma and comprehend the regulatory function of the targeted protein in processes such as cell cycle progression and its relationships with nearby molecules in the network, KEGG pathway analysis 42 43 44 Protein preparation Using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 2021, the receptors were designed by removing native ligands, heteroatoms, and water molecules. Polar hydrogen atoms and Gesteiger partial charges were added to the pdbqt protein file using AutoDock Tools, version 1.5.7 45 47 Active site identification The “receptor cavity method” was employed to forecast the receptor proteins’ binding sites using BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2021. The BIOVIA Discovery Studio SDB-Site module enabled the identification and description of protein structural binding sites. In this process, the inhibitory properties of the residues with center-x, y, and z values that were present in the binding sites were investigated 48 Ligand Preparation The structural data file (SDF) format of the NCBI PubChem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 49 50 51 Molecular Docking AutoDock Vina 1.5.7 was used for molecular docking 46 45 “vina.exe --config conf.txt --log log.txt” 45 47 52 53 Molecular dynamic simulation Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted on relevant ligand-protein complexes to examine the stability of ligand binding 54 55 56 57 58 In vitro analysis Material Chemicals and reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck, Germany). Cell line Human glioblastoma SF-767 cell lines was obtained from cultural lab of The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan. Cell culture The cells were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO 2 59 Treatment To achieve 80 ± 5% confluence, the cells were grown at a density of 104 cells/well in 96-well plates at 37 °C, 21% O2, and 5% CO2. Next, 50 µL of fresh medium was added to each well instead of the liquid medium. The cytotoxic effects of CN@AgNPs and free citronellol were investigated at dosages of 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL by adding 100 µL/well of successive dilutions. For the control group, 100 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. For twenty-four hours, the treated plates were incubated 60 Cell viability and cell death The MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability following treatment. The plates were incubated for four hours after 50 µL/well of MTT solution (0.5 mg/m/L) was added (the chamber was filled with 60% oxygen at normal pressure). To dissolve the formazan crystals, 200 µL/well of DMSO was applied after the liquid media was disposed of. A plate reader was used to measure the optical density (OD) of the wells at 570 nm, and cell viability was calculated. The tests were performed thrice, and the means and standard deviations were determined 60 Effect of compounds on expression of P53 and CDK4 in Glioblastoma (SF-767) realtime- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Following the manufacturer’s recommendations, RNA was extracted using TriPure reagent, and a UV spectrophotometer was used to determine the concentration. For RT-PCR, five micrograms of extracted RNA were utilized. Mouse leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was inactivated for five minutes at 95°C. After 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 59°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 10 min. As an internal control, β-actin was employed. The data were examined by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, software processing, and ethidium bromide staining 61 Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to statistically evaluate the data (mean ± SD) with a 95% confidence interval 60 61 50 60 Results Citronellol-based silver nanoconjuagte (CN@AgNPs) and their characterization Figure 1 +  Fig. 1 Preparation Steps for CN@AgNPs (change of color from transparent to brown showed that nanoconjugation occured). Particle size (PS) and zeta potential (ZP) measurements The produced AgNPs had a mean size of 150.88 nm, according to particle size investigations, and with a mode of particle distribution of 169.08 nm with a standard deviation of 62.19 nm (Fig. 2 S1 62 63 2 S2  Fig. 2 Characterization of Citronellol-based Silver nanoconjugates: Particle size determination: Synthesized nanoparticles size distribution ( A B C Ultraviolet-Visible spectrometry UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to confirm the synthesis of the nanoparticles and to assess the correlation between the average particle diameter and the peak observed at a specific wavelength. Additionally, the widths of the Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) bands were used to confirm the dispersion of the nanoparticles (Fig. 2 2 S3 Identification of functional groups using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) Sharp absorption bands at 1347, 1642, and 3301 cm −1 3  Fig. 3 FTIR spectrum: Graph with wavelength (cm −1 A broad peak observed around 3312 cm⁻¹ in both spectra corresponds to O–H stretching vibrations, with a noticeable broadening and slight shift in CN@AgNPs, suggesting hydrogen bonding or possible coordination between the hydroxyl oxygen and silver ions, indicating successful surface interaction. A significant shift in the C = O stretching band from 1636 cm⁻¹ in citronellol to a lower intensity and a slight shift in the CN@AgNPs further support the coordination of carbonyl groups with silver ions. Moreover, the C–H bending vibration peak near 1366 cm⁻¹ in citronellol is retained in the CN@AgNP spectrum with minor changes in intensity, indicating that the core structure of citronellol remains intact after conjugation. A distinct band at 2921 cm⁻¹ (C–H stretching) appeared in citronellol and was subtly reduced in intensity in CN@AgNPs, corresponding to an alkyl-saturated aliphatic group. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement The crystalline nature of the AgNPs was clarified by examining the XRD data. Citronellol-conjugated AgNPs are evident from the distinctive peaks observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 4 64  Fig. 4 XRD graph of CN@AgNPs, showing Peak Indices & 2 θ Positions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM examination was performed on the samples to determine their particle size distribution and shape. According to the SEM analysis, the AgNPs made from citronellol were spherical in shape. A histogram was constructed to determine the number of AgNPs in the chosen area (Fig. 5 5 5  Fig. 5 SEM image of CN@AgNPs: Magnified image of selected area with histogram ( A B In Silico Density functional theory (DFT) studies Frontier molecular orbital analysis (HOMO-LUMO) was used to predict the reactivity of citronellol and its synthetic Ag conjugates (CN@AgNPs) in comparison with the reference drug temozolomide (Fig. 6 The anticipated dipole moment, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and total energies of citronellol and its silver nanoconjugates, along with the reference drug, are displayed in Table 1 1 6 1  Table 1 Calculated energies and properties of citronellol, CN@AgNPs and reference drug.

The ADMETlab server was used to perform the toxicophore tests. All the selected drugs exhibited higher potential as therapeutic candidates with zero alertness, as indicated by the toxicological profile data in Table 3 8 Compound target predictions for glioblastoma via PIDGIN protocols and validation PIDGIN v2 (Prediction Including Inactivity), a program that uses ECFP4 circular Morgan fingerprints trained on ChEMBL actives and PubChem inactives, was used for in silico target prediction to identify possible active targets for citronellol. Eight of the 343 protein targets identified in our chemical analysis (Supplementary File S1) were first linked to glioblastoma: IDH1, TP53, BCHE, MMP2, PTGS1, NFKBIA, RUNX1, and FAK. The Human Gene Database (GeneCards) and Human Disease Database (MalaCards) were used to validate the predicted targets. Of the eight targets, MMP2 was also found in MalaCards, and IDH1 and TP53 were linked to glioblastoma in both databases. TP53 was selected for additional research based on the validation results because it had the best relevance scores in both databases (Fig. 9  Fig. 9 Validation of genes for glioblastoma; interpretation via GeneCards and MalaCards. Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network construction and KEGG enrichment analyses The activation of genes linked to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis is facilitated by the p53 protein pathway. We constructed a PPI network of p53 in the STRING database to explore genes that are directly associated with p53. Five interacting proteins, CDK4, PTEN, CDKN2A, MDM2 and EGFR, were identified by TP53 analysis (Fig. 10 S4 Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) was used to examine CDK4 expression in GBM (Fig. 10  Fig. 10 ( A p53 B Molecular Docking The action of citronellol and its nanoconjugate CN@AgNPs against the tumor suppressor p53 in glioblastoma was verified by molecular docking. The reference drug temozolomide was also included for comparison with the selected ligands. The binding affinities of all selected compounds were also evaluated for target CDK4 using molecular docking. Their potential as a dual-target treatment approach for glioblastomas was assessed. To assess the capacity of the hit to attach to targets, we created three-dimensional conformations for every molecule and docked them into the active site of the protein structures, p53 (PDB ID: 8DC8) and CDK4 (AF- P11802 p53 11 4  Fig. 11 Structure of p53 protein showing the four domains ( A B C D E F G  Table 4 Residual amino acid interactions (H-bond, metal acceptor and hydrophobic).

Similar to temozolomide (Fig. 11 11 However, the CN@AgNPs created a more stable complex by forging strong coordination connections with the oxygen atoms of the cysteine residue. The electron pairs that interacted with Ag were supplied by the O atoms in cysteine (Fig. 11  Fig. 12 Structure of CDK4 protein showing the ATP-binding domains ( A B C D E F G The structure of the CDK4 protein, which has an ATP-binding domain, was obtained from the alphafold (ID: AF- P11802 12 5  Table 5 Residual amino acid interactions (H-bond, metal acceptor and hydrophobic).

The hydroxyl group of aspartic acid (D158) (donor motif) and carbonyl oxygen (acceptor motif) of citronellol were found to interact through hydrogen bonds in the citronellol-CDK4 complex. Additionally, the hydroxyl group of citronellol (donor motif) and the π-orbital system of phenyl (F93) formed a hydrogen bond in the CDK4 binding pocket (Fig. 12 Furthermore, the CDK4 complex containing CN@AgNPs outperformed free citronellol in terms of its stability. This occurs because of the metal-acceptor bonds of the silver atoms in CN@AgNPs made with V96 (Fig. 12 5 In contrast, the reference drug temozolomide formed a less stable complex with CDK4, as it was surrounded by fewer interacting residues, despite having a comparable binding affinity (-6.0 kcal/mol) (Fig. 12 Molecular dynamic simulation The dynamic stability and intermolecular interactions of citronellol in complexes with p53 and CDK4 target proteins were evaluated as a function of 100 ns, using classical MD simulations. Figure 13 P11802 13 13 The overlapped conformations of CDK4 showed few structural variations, with citronellol regularly interacting through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with important residues, such as K35, V72, F93, and D158 (Fig. 13 13  Fig. 13 RMSD graphs for citronellol in complex with p53 ( B D A C  Fig. 14 A comparison was made between two protein-ligand complexes subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The analysis focused on three aspects: ( A B C D E F A C E Additionally, the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of the ligand–protein complexes was investigated. The RMSF values of citronellol in association with CDK4 and p53 are shown in Fig. 14 The protein-folding state, modification, and overall compactness were ascertained using the radius of gyration (RGyr). As shown in Fig. 14 14 The rather steady trend in SASA for CDK4 following the first phase (~ 20 ns) indicates that the protein’s exposure to the solvent changed very little, suggesting structural stability (Fig. 14 14 The mobility of residues along the protein chain was correlated using a Dynamic Cross-Correlation Matrix (DCCM).

Discussion In recent years, plant-derived natural agents have emerged as a key area of focus for cancer management 65 65 15 18 66 Citronellol-CMC was utilized as a biocomposite in conjunction with AgNPs to produce nanoformulations. After adding NaOH to reduce the pH to a basic level, the synthesis was completed when the color changed from colorless to pale brown, indicating the formation of Ag NPs.

The most promising potential targets for ligand interactions were identified as CDK4 and p53 by additional research using the STRING and KEGG databases.

The IC₅₀ values of citronellol (20.04 ± 4 µg/mL) and CN@AgNPs (19.67 µg/mL) indicated anti-tumor activity that was comparable to that of temozolomide against SF-767 cells (Fig. 19 84 86 The tumor suppressor protein p53 is essential for preventing cancer in healthy cells by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair 87 65 65 83 88 Furthermore, the cells were exposed to IC 50 20 These results prompted us to develop a treatment that is clinically feasible in more detail. To optimize therapeutic efficacy, the following phases will concentrate on in vivo validation, thorough mechanistic investigations, and investigation of the possibilities of combination therapy. Conclusion This work demonstrates the potential of citronellol-conjugated AgNPs (CN@AgNPs) and free citronellol as an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of glioblastoma. Effective drug administration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is made possible by the small size of CN@AgNPs, their biocompatibility, improved stability, and low toxicity. Compared to free citronellol, CN@AgNPs showed greater binding affinities and stable interactions with CDK4 and p53 active sites, as evidenced by the creation of metallic bonds, according to molecular docking studies. In vitro tests further supported these interactions, showing that CN@AgNPs significantly affected glioblastoma cells. Mechanistically, CN@AgNPs increased the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and decreased that of CDK4, indicating that they can alter important cell cycle regulators. These results, when coupled with the decreased cell viability observed in MTT experiments, suggest a possible involvement in preventing the growth of cancer cells and potentially causing cell cycle arrest, which calls for further research. Our study highlights the potential of CN@AgNPs as a cutting-edge nanotherapeutic platform for glioblastoma targeting and lays the groundwork for further preclinical and clinical research.
