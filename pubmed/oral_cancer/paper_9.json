Background With an aging population, total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) will more frequently be performed in older adults. Comorbidity burden and frailty are two distinct risk factors for adverse outcomes; however, their independent effect on outcomes after TSA is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of frailty and comorbidities on postoperative healthcare utilization after TSA. Methods Patients who underwent primary, elective anatomic or reverse TSA between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, were identified using the Premier Healthcare Database. Frailty was defined using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups Frailty Index. Comorbidity burden was defined via the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (unhealthy >2 comorbidities). These were then used to define healthy, frail, unhealthy, and frail/unhealthy patients. Rates of protracted (>2 days) length of stay (LOS), skilled nursing facility (SNF) discharges, and readmission were then compared between groups. Multivariable models were conducted to evaluate the adjusted effect of frailty and comorbidity burden. Results 86,356 patients who underwent TSA were identified. 53,913 were categorized as healthy, 29,461 as unhealthy, 1,640 as frail, and 1,342 as frail/unhealthy. The frail/unhealthy cohort had the highest rates of protracted LOS (65.06%), SNF discharges (29.90%), and readmissions (5.00%). The frail cohort had higher rates of protracted LOS (48.96% vs. 39.78%) and SNF discharges (16.77% vs. 9.94%), with similar readmission rates (3.35% vs. 3.18%) when compared to the unhealthy group. These overall trends persisted after accounting for potential confounding factors. Conclusion When both present, frailty and comorbidity appear to be a major driver of increased healthcare utilization after TSA. These data can be used to guide patient expectations and illustrate the need for postoperative pathways for these patients.

We hypothesized that patients with both frailty and high comorbidity burden would be at the highest risk of complications, nonhome discharge, higher healthcare costs, and readmissions as compared to the independent risk factors of frailty or comorbidities. Materials and methods Patients who underwent primary, elective anatomic or reverse TSA between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, were identified using the Premier Healthcare Database. The Premier Healthcare Database is a US-based, all-payer database that captures approximately 25% of all hospital admissions nationwide. Elective indications for TSA, including osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis, and rotator cuff tear, were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes, and the index TSA procedures were identified using ICD-10 procedure codes. Exclusion criteria included patients under 18 years of age, those undergoing TSA for nonelective indications, and those undergoing revision procedures. This study was exempt from institutional review board approval as all patient data were deidentified in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Identification of study cohorts Patients were stratified into groups based on frailty and comorbidity burden. Frailty was defined using the JHACG-FI, which uses 10 ICD-10-based measures of frailty (malnutrition, dementia, vision impairment, history of decubitus ulcers, urine incontinence, unexplained weight loss, fecal incontinence, poor social support, walking impairments, and fall history) to define a patient's frailty status on a binary scale. Comorbidity burden was defined via the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) which also uses ICD-10 coding schemes to define 31 comorbidities which have been shown to predict inpatient morbidity and mortality across the surgical literature. An ECI greater than two was selected to define patients with a comorbidity burden, which represented the median value of our study cohort and has been previously identified as a threshold for mortality/adverse events after surgery. 14 , 32 Cohort characteristics Patient demographics (ie, age, sex, race, payment type, procedure type) and hospital factors (size, urban or rural setting, teaching status, and region) were collected for the cohorts. The prevalence of individual ECI comorbidities, anesthesia type (general or not), and perioperative medications (dexamethasone and tranexamic acid) used during admission were evaluated and compared between the groups. Study outcomes The primary outcomes were rates of protracted length of stay (LOS), skilled nursing facility (SNF) discharges, 90-day readmissions, and cumulative hospital costs associated with the primary admission. A protracted LOS was defined as an inpatient hospital stay greater than 2 days (>75th percentile). Secondary outcomes included a composite of 90-day medical complications (venous thromboembolism, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, acute respiratory failure, and postoperative anemia requiring transfusion), surgical complications (wound dehiscence, deep/superficial surgical site infection, periprosthetic joint infection, periprosthetic fracture, dislocation, loosening/osteolysis, and other complications requiring revision), and mortality. Rates of primary and secondary outcomes were recorded across the four main study groups. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were calculated to report patient demographics, hospital factors, medical comorbidities, medication utilization, and postoperative complications between groups. Independent t Statistical significance was defined as a Bonferroni-adjusted P Results In total, 86,356 patients who underwent TSA were identified. Of these, 53,913 (62.43%) were categorized as healthy, 29,461 (34.12%) as unhealthy, 1,640 (1.90%) as frail, and 1,342 (1.55%) as frail/unhealthy. Statistically significant differences in patient age were observed between groups; however; the largest absolute difference in year was less than 4 years between the healthy and frail/unhealthy groups (73.63 vs. 70.05 years). Patients most commonly were women, married, Caucasian, and held Medicare insurance across all groups. Reverse TSA was most commonly used in all groups, with frail and frail/unhealthy (85.99%-88.72%) patients undergoing this procedure more frequently than nonfrail patients (71.54%-78.78%). Significant differences in general anesthesia, dexamethasone, and tranexamic acid use were also observed between groups, with small absolute differences in rates of general anesthesia and tranexamic acid use, however a notably lower rate of dexamethasone use in the frail/unhealthy cohort (53.90% vs. 62.63%-68.43%). Statistically significant but clinically similar trends were observed for hospital bed size, teaching status, rural setting, and geographic region between groups.

Furthermore, with the rising utilization of bundled payments models in shoulder arthroplasty, it is imperative for physicians and hospital systems to identify patients at elevated risk of prolonged postoperative hospitalization, acute complications, and readmissions/revisions. Utilizing a nationwide all-payers database, we found that the comprehensive JHACG-FI and comorbidity burden independently predicted adverse outcomes including surgical and medical complications, protracted LOS, SNF discharge, and 90-day readmission. Furthermore, by combining these two risk factors, we were able to identify a subset of shoulder arthroplasty patients at significantly higher risk of these adverse outcomes and elevated healthcare costs following shoulder arthroplasty. Frail and unhealthy status among the study cohort were each predictive risk factors for protracted LOS, SNF discharge, and readmission. Importantly, despite controlling for confounding variables, patients who were both frail and unhealthy had a significantly higher risk of these adverse outcomes and increased hospital-associated costs. In an institutional cohort study, Cox et al noted that patients undergoing reverse TSA who were discharged to SNF had elevated Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and modified frailty index. 5 11 14 Among the frail and unhealthy cohort, medical complications were 7.5 times more likely to occur, and surgical complications were 2.1-fold more likely despite controlling for potential confounders. The relationship of frailty and comorbidities leading to increased risk of surgical and medical complications has been previously demonstrated independently within the shoulder arthroplasty literature. In a retrospective cohort study of 127 patients, Chalmers et al noted a correlation between rates of overall complications and CCI on multivariate regression analysis. 3 5 13 , 36 11 While frailty and unhealthy status alone did not predict significantly higher healthcare costs in our study, patients who were both frail and unhealthy had significantly elevated costs due to protracted LOS, SNF discharge, and readmission following shoulder arthroplasty. The effects of comorbidities on costs following shoulder arthroplasty have been well-documented. 6 , 31 , 39 6 39 31 33 There are several limitations to the present study. First, as with any retrospective database study, we are limited by the available data as well as the ICD coding within the database. However, there is no reason to suspect that any potential errors in database coding would disproportionately affect one cohort. Comprehensive identification of the cohorts based on 41 ICD-10-based measures and multivariable analysis was performed to minimize potential confounding between the cohorts. Similarly, the outcomes of this study were limited to short-term 90-day complications based on limitations of the database; however, this time frame allows for capture of discharge disposition, acute complications, readmission, and total costs within the global period following surgery. Selection bias of inpatient-only shoulder arthroplasty databases as previously published was mitigated by using the Premier Database which contains both inpatient and outpatient encounters from hospital and ambulatory surgical centers and captures 25% of all encounters nationwide across all payers. Our study has several advantages as compared to previously published studies. First, our study represents a modern shoulder arthroplasty cohort stratified using the ECI, an updated, ICD-10 clinical modification code based measure which allowed for acute capture of underlying medical comorbidity burden using 31 diagnoses and superior predictive capabilities within several surgical subspecialties. 4 , 18 , 22 , 23 , 26 17 , 35 Conclusion The results of this study serve to help surgeons and healthcare professionals identify patients at high-risk elevated hospital costs due to protracted LOS, SNF discharge, and readmissions. When both present, frailty and comorbidity appear to be a major driver of increased healthcare utilization after TSA. These data can be used to guide patient expectations and illustrate the need for preoperative optimization and appropriate postoperative pathways for these patients. Future work focusing on the effects of preoperative modification and optimization of frailty and comorbidities may reduce adverse outcomes. Disclaimers: Funding: This project received no funding.
