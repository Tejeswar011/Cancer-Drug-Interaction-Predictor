CKD was associated with lower rate of guideline-directed management and worse prognosis. Uptake of guideline-directed management increased and prognosis improved in both groups during the study period. Background CKD is present in >30% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and has been associated with lower rates of guideline-directed management and worse prognosis. We investigated the use of guideline-directed management and mortality risk in patients with and without CKD. Methods A nationwide cohort study based on health care registers encompassing all patients ≥18 years hospitalized with first-time MI in Denmark from 2010 to 2022 was conducted. CKD was defined as an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 Results In total, we identified 21,009 patients who met eligibility criteria. The median age was 72 years, and 61% of patients were male; the median eGFR was 82 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 P P P P P P Conclusions Although survival after MI improved for all patients, CKD continued to be associated with lower use of guideline-directed management and higher mortality. cardiovascular cardiovascular disease cardiovascular events CKD clinical epidemiology epidemiology and outcomes Augustinus Fonden 19-2397 Arvid Nilssons Fond Ellen Linnea Freese Ballegaard Helsefonden 21-B-0387 Augustinus Fonden 19-2397 Arvid Nilssons Fond Helsefonden 21-B-0387 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf no pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes SDC T Read-along YES ",
