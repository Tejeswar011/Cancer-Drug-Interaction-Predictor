Introduction In recent years, food-based interventions that use traditional medicinal plants have attracted increasing attention as adjunct strategies for preventing and treating gastrointestinal diseases [ 1 Dioscoreae Rhizoma 2 3 Dioscoreae Rhizoma 4 5 6 7 This study aims to investigate the gastrointestinal effects of Dioscoreae Rhizoma Dioscoreae Rhizoma 2. Materials and Methods This study comprehensively reviewed human and animal studies published up to April 2025 that investigated the effects of Dioscoreae Rhizoma Dioscoreae Rhizoma The methodology adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines [ 8 Dioscoreae Rhizoma https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WJM23 2.1. Search Strategy A standardized search strategy was used to retrieve relevant human clinical trials and in vivo animal studies that evaluated the effects of Dioscoreae Rhizoma Dioscorea Dioscorea Eight electronic databases were systematically searched: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Citation Information by NII (CiNii), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and the Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS). Search strategies were adapted to each database’s structure and indexing conventions; for example, topic- or abstract-specific filters were applied in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. The search covered all years available within each database up to April 2025. Detailed search strings and strategies for PubMed are presented in Table 1 2.2. Selection Criteria Study selection followed predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Table 2 2.2.1. Inclusion Criteria This systematic review incorporated both human and in vivo animal studies that investigated the effects of Dioscoreae Rhizoma Dioscoreae Rhizoma 2.2.2. Exclusion Criteria Studies were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (1) in vitro experiments using cell cultures or tissue samples; (2) studies involving multi-herbal formulations in which the independent effect of Dioscoreae Rhizoma 2.3. Data Extraction Two reviewers (J.-H.L. and S.-Y.P.) independently screened studies for eligibility in accordance with PRISMA 2020. Screening proceeded in three stages: title screening, abstract screening, and full-text assessment. At each stage, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were rigorously applied. All records were managed with EndNote 21 (Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA, USA) to facilitate systematic organization and removal of duplicates. For the final set of included studies, data were collected with a pre-established extraction template. For in vivo animal studies, the following details were recorded: year of publication, first author, disease model, species, experimental inducer, route and duration of administration, proposed mechanisms, primary outcomes, and reported efficacy. For human clinical studies, data fields included study objectives, intervention details, participant numbers, intervention duration, analytical methods, key outcomes, and conclusions. Discrepancies between the two primary reviewers were resolved through discussion; unresolved disagreements were adjudicated by a third reviewer (S.-J.K.). 2.4. Quality Control To ensure methodological rigor, the risk of bias was independently evaluated for human and in vivo animal studies using tools appropriate to each design. For randomized human studies, risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool [ 9 For non-randomized human studies, risk of bias was assessed with the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions Version 2 (ROBINS-I V2) tool [ 10 For in vivo animal studies, risk of bias was assessed with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) Risk of Bias tool [ 11 Conflicts between reviewers were discussed to reach agreement; unresolved issues were adjudicated by a third reviewer (S.-J.K.), who served as the final arbiter. 3. Results 3.1. Search Process for Included Studies An initial yield of 865 records was obtained through extensive searches across eight electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, CiNii, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, OASIS, and AMED. After removing 296 duplicate records, 569 entries remained for title and abstract screening. Of these, 498 were excluded as unrelated to the topic. Subsequently, 71 articles were selected for full-text retrieval. Four reports could not be retrieved. The remaining 67 articles underwent full-text evaluation for eligibility. Based on predefined criteria, 8 studies using herbal mixtures (in which the independent effect of Dioscoreae Rhizoma Ultimately, 27 studies met the eligibility criteria and were retained for final analysis. Of these, 25 were in vivo animal studies and 2 were human studies. The study selection process, including identification, screening, and inclusion, is illustrated in the PRISMA flow diagram ( Figure 1 3.2. Characteristics of the Included Studies 3.2.1. Description of the Human Studies Two clinical trials were incorporated into this review, both investigating the effects of Dioscoreae Rhizoma Liang et al.

Description of the In Vivo Studies A total of 25 in vivo studies were included in this review. Most were conducted in rodents: 8 in rats and 14 in mice. The remaining three studies used common carp, rainbow trout, and weaned lamb, respectively. The experimental disease models varied widely, encompassing gastric lesions, colitis, CRC, food allergy, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and immunosuppression, as well as healthy models aimed at evaluating gastrointestinal and immune functions.

Risk of Bias Assessment for Included Human Studies The risk of bias assessment for the two human studies included in this review was conducted using two different tools. For the randomized trial by Liang et al. [ 12 13 3.3.1. Bias Arising from the Randomization Process Liang et al. [ 12 13 3.3.2. Bias Due to Deviations from Intended Interventions Liang et al.

Bias in Selection of the Reported Result Neither study had a pre-registered protocol or publicly available statistical analysis plan. Although both reported the outcomes described in their respective methods sections, the lack of a predefined plan raises the potential for selective reporting. Therefore, Liang et al. rated it as having some concerns [ 12 13 3.3.6. Bias Due to Confounding This domain is not applicable under the Cochrane RoB 2 framework. The study by Pramana et al.

Risk of Bias Assessment for Included Animal Studies The methodological quality of the included animal studies ( n Supplementary Table S1 3.4.1. Sequence Generation Of the 25 studies, 8 clearly described appropriate random sequence generation (e.g., random number tables, lottery methods), and were rated as low risk of bias. Twelve studies used vague terms like “randomization” without methodological clarification and were rated as having some concerns. Four studies provided no information on sequence generation and were classified as no information. One study explicitly reported non-random or intentional assignment methods and were rated as high risk of bias. 3.4.2. Baseline Characteristics Among the 25 studies, 21 reported no significant baseline differences or demonstrated adequate balance between groups, and were thus rated as low risk of bias. Four studies lacked statistical comparison or used vague descriptions, resulting in a rating of “some concerns.” None of the studies were categorized as providing “no information” or high risk of bias. 3.4.3. Allocation Concealment Only 5 studies described allocation concealment procedures and were rated as low risk of bias. Three studies hinted at concealment but lacked detail, resulting in a rating of “some concerns.” The remaining 17 studies made no mention of allocation concealment and were rated as “no information.” 3.4.4. Random Housing Sixteen studies provided no information on housing practices (e.g., random or treatment-group housing), and were rated as no “information.” Four studies offered unclear statements such as “housed separately,” leading to a rating of “some concerns.” The remaining five studies explicitly reported random housing or cage allocation, and were rated as low risk of bias. 3.4.5. Blinding of Caregivers and Investigators Only four studies described appropriate blinding procedures for caregivers or investigators and were judged to have a low risk of bias. Four studies used terms such as “blinded” or “double-blind” without adequate elaboration and were categorized as having “some concerns.” Sixteen studies lacked any information on this aspect and were marked as “no information.” Additionally, one study explicitly indicated that outcomes were assessed without blinding or involved highly subjective endpoints and was therefore considered at high risk of bias. 3.4.6. Random Outcome Assessment Four studies clearly reported randomized outcome assessment and were classified as having a low risk of bias. Fourteen studies did not provide sufficient information regarding the order of measurements or assessor independence and were rated as “no information.” The remaining seven studies were judged to have “some concerns” due to vague descriptions or insufficient procedural detail. 3.4.7. Blinding of Outcome Assessment Two studies reported assessor blinding or employed objective measurements and were rated as having a low risk of bias. Sixteen studies were judged to have “some concerns” due to limited information on the blinding of outcome assessors. Five studies lacked any information on this domain and were categorized as “no information.” Additionally, two studies explicitly stated that outcomes were assessed without blinding or used highly subjective endpoints and were therefore considered to be at high risk of bias. 3.4.8. Incomplete Outcome Data Among the 25 included animal studies, 23 either reported no attrition or provided clear and adequate justifications for excluded data and were therefore assessed as having a low risk of attrition bias. In contrast, two studies lacked sufficient explanation for missing or incomplete outcome data and were thus rated as having a high risk of bias in this domain. 3.4.9. Selective Outcome Reporting Fourteen studies reported prespecified outcomes or showed consistency with the study objectives and were rated as having a low risk of bias. Nine studies did not provide sufficient detail to evaluate the completeness of reporting and were judged as having “some concerns.” Two studies omitted critical endpoints without justification and were considered at high risk of reporting bias. 3.4.10. Other Sources of Bias Sixteen studies fulfilled at least two quality assurance criteria, such as sample size justification, ethical approval, or appropriate statistical analysis, and were therefore considered to have a low risk of bias. Seven studies raised “some concerns” due to incomplete methodological transparency or potential conflicts of interest. Two studies lacked sufficient information on these aspects and were marked as “no information.” 4. Discussion 4.1.

Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions This review is the first to systematically analyze the multifaceted effects of Dioscorea Rhizoma Dioscorea Rhizoma However, only two clinical studies were included, both with limited sample sizes and one using a non-randomized, uncontrolled design. The lack of high-quality RCTs assessing the isolated effects of Dioscorea Rhizoma Future research should include large-scale, well-designed RCTs with standardized interventions, dosage protocols, and validated biomarkers to better assess the clinical utility of Dioscorea Rhizoma 5.
