However, its exact contributions to colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unidentified. We aimed to ascertain the prognostic significance of TIMP3 in CRC patients through a bioinformatic approach. GEPIA, UALCAN, Kaplan–Meier plotter, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, TIMER, TISIDB, the ScTIME database, TISMO, TIDE, CAMOIP, and TISCH2 were employed to comprehensively analyze the differential expression, prognostic value, genetic alterations, signaling pathways, immune cell infiltration, tumor microenvironment (TME) and associated genes of TIMP3 in CRC patients. Compared to adjacent normal tissues, we observed a significant downregulation of TIMP3 expression in CRC samples. Gene interaction networks elucidated that TIMP3 and its associated genes play a pivotal role in cancer progression, particularly in processes critical to colorectal cancer, such as extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. Analysis of the TME further indicates that TIMP3 expression was intricately associated with diverse immune cell types infiltration levels, chemokines, and immunomodulators. Most importantly, those with elevated TIMP3 expression had improved immunological scores.

Introduction Colorectal cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors of the gastrointestinal tract due to its high morbidity and mortality rate [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the integrity of healthy tissues is significantly influenced by the ratio of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [ 12 13 14 13 15 16 In addition, TIMP3 has been shown to induce endothelial apoptosis and to directly interact with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 to prevent angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 TIMP3, a member of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases family, is vital for regulating immune infiltration and inhibiting tumor growth in multiple cancer types. In glioblastoma, elevated TIMP3 expression is associated with improved patient survival and enhanced infiltration of immune cells [ 24 25 26 27 With the rapid advancements in immune infiltration research and microarray technology, bioinformatics has become an essential approach for analyzing the expression patterns and prognostic relevance of TIMP3 gene in CRC. Integrating relevant databases and applying advanced technologies are key to conducting more comprehensive and insightful investigations. This study entailed a thorough bioinformatics analysis of TIMP3 across numerous databases, with the goal of determining its clinical importance, prognostic implications, and expression patterns in CRC. While previous studies have examined the association of TIMP3 with prognosis and pathogenesis in cancer [ 28 29 2. Results 2.1. TIMP3 is Highly Expressed in Normal Cells Compared to CRC We determined the differential expression of the TIMP3 gene in matched normal tissues and different types of malignancies (pan-cancer) through an online search of the GEPIA database ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Analysis of the data using the GEPIA 2.0 tool indicated a statistically significant decrease in TIMP3 gene expression in CRC ( p Figure 1 Figure 1 To strengthen our understanding of the role of TIMP3 in CRC, we utilized TCGA data from UALCAN to assess TIMP3 protein expression and its association with the clinicopathological characteristics of CRC. The analysis revealed a significant decrease in TIMP3 protein expression in CRC samples compared to normal samples ( p Figure 2 Figure 2 p Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.2. The Immune Response in CRC Tissues Is Enhanced by TIMP3 and Its Co-Expressed Genes Following an analysis of TIMP3 expression and its prognostic implications in COAD patients, using LinkedOmics, we identified co-expressed genes and associated pathways to explore its potential biological roles in colon cancer. LinkedOmics’ volcano plot ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.3. TIMP3 Displays an Intricate Association with Immune-Related Regulatory Molecules We next explored the intricate connections between TIMP3 and various components such as chemokines, receptors, immune inhibitors, and stimulators using the comprehensive resources of the TISIDB database. This in-depth analysis aimed to enhance our comprehension of the intricate interplay between TIMP3 expression and immune infiltration. According to our findings, multiple immunoinhibitors and immunostimulators showed positive associations with the levels of TIMP3 in COAD, including ADORA1, BTLA, CD96, KDR, IL10, CD27, CD40, and CXCL12. In COAD, TIMP3 was negatively correlated with multiple immune stimulators and immunoinhibitors, including CD160 and KLRC1 ( Figure 4 Figure 5 2.4. Genetic Alteration of TIMP3 Is Significantly Associated with Survival of CRC Patients Genetic alterations of TIMP3 TIMP3 TIMP3 Figure 6 26/D202Gfs Figure 6 Figure 6 We also looked into the possibility that patient survival in colorectal cancer was related to variations in the TIMP3 gene. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the genetic alterations were not associated with poorer overall survival (OS) ( p p p p Figure 7 2.5. Single-Cell Expression Analysis Highlights TIMP3’s Role in TME Remodeling and Immune Regulation We analyzed the CRC_EMTAB8107, CRC_GSE146771, CRC_GSE166555 and CRC_GSE179784 colorectal cancer datasets to investigate TIMP3 expression across different cell populations within the TME. The results showed that TIMP3 expression was broadly distributed throughout a variety of immune cell types, including B cells, conventional CD4 + + Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 The widespread expression of TIMP3 in almost every kind of immune cell suggests that it plays a critical role in regulating immune suppression in the TME. This might involve suppressing immune cell activation, encouraging immune inhibitory cell growth and activity, and altering signaling pathways linked to immune evasion. Among all cell types, fibroblast cells had the highest expression of TIMP3; therefore, cell communication analysis was performed to understand its relevance. These results indicated strong interactions between fibroblast cells and monocytes/macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, CD4 + + Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 2.6. TIMP3 Modulates Immune Outcomes in the Tumor Microenvironment at a Single-Cell Level Twenty primary cell types were identified from the cell populations ( Figure 9 Figure 9 + p + In CRC, the circle plots revealed that CD8-PDCD1 and NK FC3RGA cells interacted with other CD4-CTLA4-Treg cells the most, demonstrating their active biological connections ( Figure 9 Figure 9 p 2.7. Immune Cell Infiltration and TIMP3 in Patients with CRC The onset and progression of cancer are significantly influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its interactions with cancer cells [ 30 + + p –11 + p –10 8+ p –2 p –21 p –11 p –23 p –7 p –1 p –1 Figure 10 Using the gene module feature of TIMER3.0, we further explored how the expression of TIMP3 correlates with the degree of immune infiltration in COAD patients. Using the gene module feature of TIMER3.0, we further analyzed the correlation between TIMP3 expression and immune cell infiltration in COAD patients. TIMP3 expression showed significant elevation in fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells across multiple CRC datasets. A similar trend was also found after correlation analysis: TIMP3 was found to be positively corelated with fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells ( Figure 10 p p Figure 10 2.8. TIMP3 Affects the Immune Microenvironment of CRC Tissues in TIMP3 High Low To explore the influence of TIMP3 on the TME, CAMOIP was used to detect the infiltrated proportions of immune cells using TCGA-CRC data. The variations in the 22 different TIIC types between TIMP3 high low low + + high Figure 11 high 31 high Low high Figure 11 We next evaluated the immunological score of CRC patients with differential TIMP3 expression, since TIMP3 can influence the TME in CRC, particularly fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial-associated cells. When compared to TIMP3 low high Figure 10 high Figure 11 We used a GSEA enrichment approach to analyze the top 20 enriched GO-BP, GO-CC, GO-MF, and Reactome terms in the CAMOIP database in order to better understand the potential function of TIMP3 in CRC. Angiogenesis, blood/vascular development, MAPK cascade and cytokine signaling, and cell morphogenesis/differentiation are anticipated to be enriched by TIMP3-Low. The prevalence of mutations in oncogenic drivers is greater in TIMP3-low cancers. Angiogenesis, inflammation, and MAPK signaling pathway enrichment were seen in the TIMP3 low Figure 11 The findings also indicated that immunoglobulin complex, collagen trimer, and the external encapsulating structure of the plasma membrane were the primary GO-CC terms ( Figure 11 Figure 11 Figure 11 2.9. Predictive Value of TIMP3 in Modulating Immunotherapy Using survival outcomes and treatment response based on human immunotherapy cohorts, we evaluated the efficacy of TIMP3 in predicting response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in the TIDE database in comparison to other canonical biomarkers, such as Custom, Merck 18, B clonality, T clonality, IFNG, CD8, CD274, TMB, MSI score, and TIDE. According to Figure 12 Additionally, we used TISMO database analysis to determine the expression of TIMP3 in cancer immunotherapy. The findings demonstrated that various immunotherapeutic responses were linked to TIMP3 expression ( Figure 12 Figure 12 3. Discussion Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third globally among the most prevalent cancers and remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths [ 32 33 Studies reveal that TIMP3 (24-kDa glycoprotein), a member of the TIMP family of proteins, acts as a potent tumor suppressor by preventing tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Notably, TIMP3 distinguishes itself within the TIMP family as the only member that can bind strongly to the extracellular matrix, making it a crucial protein in the control of metastasis [ 28 34 35 35 36 Our study represents a pioneering effort in integrating data from various sources, including transcriptome, mutation, mRNA, protein, and immune infiltration expression datasets of TIMP3 in CRC. Using multiple databases, such as GEPIA, UALCAN, GeneMANIA, KM Plotter, TIMER, TISIDB, cBioPortal, TIMER, LinkedOmics, TISMO, ScTIME, and TISCH2, we observed notable variation in the expression of TIMP3 within CRC. In particular, TIMP3 expression was lower in COAD tissues than in normal tissues, and a significant correlation emerged between the clinical stages of COAD patients and TIMP3 expression. These findings imply that TIMP3 is a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in suppressing the development, progress, and metastasis of CRC. The multidimensional analysis, encompassing diverse data types, enhances our understanding of the intricate role that TIMP3 plays in CRC pathogenesis. In this study, significant downregulation of TIMP3 was detected in several cancer types, such as lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), kidney chromophobe (KICH), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) tissues, in addition to CRC. Analysis of the top 50 interactors of TIMP3 coupled with a protein–protein interaction network revealed that these genes are predominantly connected to extracellular structures and functions and play a substantial role in angiogenesis. Through GO and KEGG enrichment analyses using the GeneMANIA (software version 3.5.2) program and LinkedOmics ( http://linkedomics.org/admin.php The prevalence, development, and spread of cancer are intricately associated with the extent of immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 39 40 43 43 44 45 46 Establishing connections between these genes not only enhances our understanding, but also facilitates the identification of potential multi-gene-based therapeutic strategies for clinicians. Data from cBioPortal revealed that sequence changes in TIMP3 are infrequent events in CRC. In 2850 analyzed CRC samples, the combined frequency of structural variants, copy number alterations, and point mutations was merely 1%. The limited occurrence of TIMP3 sequence and copy number alterations in CRC strongly suggests that they are unlikely to serve as primary drivers of the observed under-expression of TIMP3. Consequently, our investigation leans towards the likelihood of an alternative molecular mechanism contributing to this phenomenon. CD4 + + 47 + + Chemokines, classified as chemotactic cytokines, play a crucial role in mediating immune cell trafficking, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis [ 48 49 50 51 52 53 We also investigated the function of TIMP3 in the TME and discovered that its expression was favorably connected with immune cells such CD8 cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further revealed that TIMP3 is associated with multiple immune-related pathways. These findings imply that TIMP3 could be involved in the CRC TME. The expression levels of various genes associated with immunity in a variety of tumor types were correlated with TIMP3 expression. Our validation results from the TIDE database also demonstrated that TIMP3 had a greater predictive value for response to immunotherapy. This suggests that, for the majority of tumor types, TIMP3 has superior predictive potential for immunotherapy response, as many modules showed AUC values of more than 0.5. According to current research, our findings could offer a fresh approach to immunotherapy biomarker creation and mining. Diverse immune cell types play distinct roles in the growth of tumors. Although M1 macrophages, NK cells, and CD8 + high TIMP3 has the potential to be a therapeutic target and an indicator of tumor susceptibility to numerous anticancer drugs, in addition to being a biomarker for predicting the development of cancer [ 54 55 Limitations This study has several limitations that must be addressed in future research. Our conclusions are based entirely on bioinformatics analyses of public databases, and experimental validation is necessary to confirm these findings. Due to the absence of clinical cohorts of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing immunotherapy, TIMP3’s role in predicting immunological responses in CRC could not be evaluated. While functional enrichment analysis and PPI network construction provided useful insights into TIMP3-associated genes, these methods may not fully capture the complexity of gene functions in specific biological contexts. Further experimental studies, such as immunohistochemistry and western blotting, are needed to analyze the protein expression levels of relevant immune-related genes. We have identified genes associated with differential TIMP3 expression levels in CRC that could offer similar clinical value, due to their comparable roles in CRC. However, the clinical application of immune-related gene signatures must be validated in larger prospective trials. TIMP3 and related gene expression can be quantified using q-PCR in CRC cell lines and patient samples, and protein expression can be analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting to establish its association with clinical and pathological characteristics. Gene knockout or overexpression experiments, pathway analysis, and mechanistic studies can provide further insights in the molecular pathways and cellular processes involved in CRC pathogenesis. Furthermore, while the correlation between TIMP3 expression levels and clinical outcomes like overall survival and disease stage provides valuable predictive insights, it is important to note that these conclusions are based on correlation studies and retrospective data, and hence require experimental validation. Ultimately, expanding our research regarding TIMP3’s molecular mechanisms in influencing cancer patient prognoses offers potential for improving tumor diagnosis and treatment. TIMP3 emerges as a promising biomarker with potential applications in cancer research and clinical practice, making it a novel target for further investigation. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1.

Conclusions In conclusion, our research highlights the significant differential expression of TIMP3, particularly in colorectal adenocarcinoma, where it emerges as an influential factor in prognosis and clinical traits. Its expression is intricately linked with immune infiltration in CRC, suggesting a regulatory role in the immune microenvironment and contributing to its prognostic impact. As a promising biomarker, TIMP3 holds the potential for predicting outcomes in CRC cases with immune infiltration. With all aspects considered, this work bridges the gap between immune response and gene expression in colorectal cancer (CRC), expanding our knowledge of TIMP3 as a tumor suppressor and immune landscape regulator with potential implications for immunotherapeutic targeting. Our analysis underscores TIMP3’s immunoregulatory properties, positioning it as a predictive indicator for patient prognosis. TIMP3 influences immune cell infiltration, including T cells and macrophages, making it a potential target or co-target in immunotherapeutic strategies. It can serve as prognostic biomarker, as TIMP3 expression levels have been correlated with patient survival across various cancers, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and thyroid cancer. Low TIMP3 expression is frequently associated with poor prognosis, increased tumor aggressiveness, and metastasis. It may also be used as a predictive marker for drug sensitivity in colorectal cancer.
