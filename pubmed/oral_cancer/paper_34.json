These disruptions may lead to health risks from delayed or reduced care. Health system resilience (HSR) – a critical factor in maintaining health services during crises – refers to a system’s ability to anticipate, prepare for, absorb, respond to, recover from, and adapt to disruptions. To be effective, HSR must also be equitable, ensuring that all socioeconomic groups have access to healthcare services during crises. Sweden’s approach, which relied on public adherence to government recommendations rather than enforcing restrictions, presents a unique case for studying HSR. Aim This study aims to evaluate aspects of HSR in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic by analysing changes in essential health service utilisation across different phases of the pandemic, and by examining sociodemographic differences in utilisation by education and sex. Method This study utilises interrupted time series analysis to evaluate changes in healthcare service utilisation across various levels of the Swedish health system with stratification by education and sex. Primary care was measured through diabetes diagnoses, emergency care through appendicitis cases, inpatient care through hospital admission for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and cancer diagnostics through diagnosis rates. Data were obtained from various population based Swedish health registries through the SWECOV project. Results The findings highlight varying degrees of disruptions and resilience across different sectors. Emergency care, primary care, and symptom-based cancer diagnosis showed signs of recovery after an initial drop, whereas cancer screening, was more affected. In the case of inpatient care for IBD, the number of admissions declined, though the length of hospital stays remained unchanged. Education level did not impact healthcare utilisation for most indicators, and differences between men and women were generally small. Conclusion The Swedish HSR during the COVID-19 pandemic was challenged but remained intact in most healthcare sectors. The health system on different levels also managed to a large degree cater for the diagnoses covered in this study, largely independent of educational level and sex. As data availability increases with time further research will help gain a deeper understanding of the outcomes of the pandemic on health services unrelated to COVID-19, including the role of education in influencing healthcare utilisation.

Sweden took a unique approach during the early phase of the pandemic by relying on public adherence to government recommendations, rather than strict lockdowns. While other countries gradually reduced their non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) later in 2020, Sweden largely maintained its initially moderate strategy throughout the year, making it an interesting case for studying health system resilience [ 1 2 3 4 Sweden had one of Europe’s lowest scores on the Oxford Stringency Index, a composite measure based on indicators such as school closures, workplace closures, and travel bans that provides a systematic way to compare government responses to the pandemic across countries [ 5 The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a health system as all organisations, people, and actions aimed at promoting, restoring, or maintaining health [ 6 7 8 9 7 Sociodemographic factors, such as education, significantly influence access to healthcare services, and the pandemic has exacerbated existing disparities in healthcare utilisation across different socioeconomic status (SES) groups globally [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Ensuring equitable resilience is crucial, as socioeconomic disparities and sex can exacerbate the impact of disruptions on vulnerable groups [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 24 To our knowledge, no studies provide a comprehensive overview of health system resilience in Sweden, and the effect of education and sex, during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly given Sweden’s unique approach of relying on public adherence to government recommendations rather than strict restrictions. Methods Aim This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the utilisation of health services across four sectors, and how it might have differed depending on educational level and sex: (i) primary care, (ii) inpatient care, (iii) emergency care, and (iv) cancer diagnostics – offering insights into how Sweden’s health system can inform global strategies for maintaining essential healthcare services during crises. Study design The primary method used for this analysis is interrupted time series (ITS) analysis, a quasi-experimental study design. Data were collected from SWECOV, a comprehensive infrastructure linking multiple Swedish registers and capturing nearly the entire population, before, during and after the pandemic as defined below. Data sources Data was obtained through the SWECOV project, which combines 53 population registers with individual-level data covering 15.7 million Swedish residents (alive 1990–2022) for the purposes of COVID-19 related research [ 25 26 27 The time periods for our analysis were defined as follows: (i) the pre-pandemic period: January 1st, 2018, to March 10th, 2020, (ii) the pandemic period: March 11th, 2020, to February 8th, 2022, and (iii) the post-pandemic period: February 9th, 2022, to December 31st, 2022. The pandemic period was defined based on the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 by the WHO [ 28 29 Indicators and variables The study analyses the utilisation of services of different health system sectors: primary care, inpatient care, emergency care, and cancer diagnostics. For each sector variables were predefined and selected based on previous literature as well as on data availability to represent that specific sector, and no clear link to COVID-19 infection. For Primary care, we assessed number of new type 2 diabetes diagnoses from 2018 to 2020, using the first prescription of oral antidiabetic drugs (excluding insulin, but including GLP-1 receptor agonists) from 2017 onward, identified through the ATC code A10B, based on data from the Prescribed Drug Register (PDR) [ 30 22 24 31 For Inpatient Care, we analysed both the average length and number of hospitalisations for IBD patients from 2018 to 2022, using data from the National Patient Register (NPR) [ 32 To represent Emergency Care, number of appendicitis diagnoses from 2018 to 2022, extracted from the NPR was chosen. Appendicitis is a condition that typically requires emergency care. Appendicitis as an indicator has been used in a previous study to assess the capacity of emergency care during the pandemic in South Korea [ 33 Finally, to study how the health system managed to maintain Cancer Diagnostics, the number of new diagnoses of two different types of cancer was assessed, cervical and oesophageal cancer. These diagnoses, spanning from 2018 to 2022, are based on data from the National Cancer Register (NCR) to which reporting is mandatory [ 34 35 36 22 23 37 SES was measured through a proxy: education level. The longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labour market studies (LISA) provided data on education level from one to seven, where one is “Less than 9 years of education” and 7 is “doctoral education”. For this analysis we chose to use 2 categories: low and high education. Low education comprised Less than 9 years of education (e.g., incomplete compulsory school) or 9–10 years of education (e.g., completed compulsory school) or upper secondary education (2–3 years, e.g., gymnasieskola) or post-secondary education of less than 2 years. Whereas high education included: Post-secondary education of 2 or more years without a degree, post-secondary education with a degree (e.g., bachelor’s or master’s), or doctoral education (PhD or equivalent) [ 38 39 Data adjustment and visualization Data for diabetes first prescriptions and cervical cancer diagnoses were manually adjusted for seasonality, as both conditions exhibit annual fluctuations in diagnosis rates, likely due to changes in healthcare utilisation and diagnostic practices during holiday periods. Moving averages were applied to some indicators in the graphical representations to effectively illustrate the results. Data analysis Graphical representations of the data were created to facilitate interpretation of changes over time, with tables summarising average utilisation and percentage changes before, during, and after the pandemic, stratified by education and sex. Education was not included for appendicitis, as a large proportion of patients were minors who had not yet completed their education. Structural breaks between the three different time periods, pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic were tested using the Wald test to determine significant shifts. The Wald test was used to evaluate the null hypothesis of no structural break to determine whether any changes at the beginning or at the end of the pandemic are statistically significant compared to normal fluctuations throughout the years. Results Primary care (new prescriptions for diabetes type 2) At the start of the pandemic, prescriptions for oral antidiabetic medications and GLP-1 analogues dropped substantially, indicating a decline in primary care utilisation. However, by autumn 2020, the number of prescriptions had nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels. (Fig. 1 1  Fig. 1 a b c When dividing the population by education group the results show some differences. People of lower education level utilised the primary care system less for first A10B prescriptions as the pandemic began. People in this group are also more sensitive to seasonal trends, especially during the summer (Fig. 1 There are no strong differences between men and women when it comes to A10B first prescription. Prescriptions went down for both groups, slightly more for men than for women (Fig. 1 Inpatient care (IBD admissions) The number of days spent in any hospital for IBD showed no significant changes over time before, during, or after the pandemic (Fig. 2 1  Fig. 2 a b The length of hospitalisation for IBD was similar, independent on level of education (Fig. 2 IBD hospitalisation length is no different in men and women throughout the entire observation period and showed no changes over time (data not shown). However, the number of weekly hospital admissions of IBD patients decreased significantly at the start of the pandemic and did not fully recover in the post-pandemic period, possibly continuing a decreasing trend seen already before the pandemic. (Fig. 3 1  Fig. 3 a b c The overall rate of the higher education group is lower when it comes to IBD admissions. Both lower and higher education group experienced a drop at the start of the pandemic, although it was more pronounced in the higher education group (Fig. 3 IBD admissions are over time higher in women than in men, excluding a small dip in the end of 2020 when women’s admissions dip lower than those of men. Neither group has recovered and returned to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the observation period (Fig. 3 Emergency care (appendicitis diagnoses) During the pandemic, there was an increase in the number of appendicitis diagnoses followed by a substantial decline by the end of the pandemic, with numbers returning to pre-pandemic levels. The number of appendicitis diagnoses per day ranges from a low of 32 (pre- and post-pandemic) to a peak of 38 diagnoses per day (pandemic period). (Fig. 4 1  Fig. 4 a b Appendicitis cases are throughout the study period higher in men than in women but pattern over time is similar for both sexes. (Fig. 4 Cancer diagnostics (cervical and oesophageal cancer diagnoses) Number of diagnoses of cervical cancer per week declined during the pandemic. While there were signs of recovery after February 2022, the observed increase was insufficient to account for all the missed diagnoses during the pandemic (Fig. 5 1  Fig. 5 a b There was a decrease in number of cervical cancer diagnoses in both the higher and lower education groups. Towards the end of 2020 the diagnosis rate is still lower than before the pandemic in both groups, but the lower education group demonstrates a higher rate of diagnoses than the higher education. Neither group recovers by the end of the observation period (Fig. 5 Following a decline in oesophageal cancer diagnoses shortly after the pandemic began, recovery started within a few months. The number of diagnoses then remained relatively stable throughout the post-pandemic period. (Fig. 6 1  Fig. 6 a b c For oesophageal cancer there is a decrease in diagnoses in both higher and lower education group. The higher education group has an overall lower incidence of cases (Fig. 6 The incidence of oesophageal cancer is higher in men than in women. At the beginning of the pandemic there is a small decrease in cases diagnosed in men that then recovers by mid 2021. In women there is an increase in diagnoses between mid 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 (Fig. 6 Wald test The Wald test fails to reject the null hypothesis for IBD hospitalisation length, showing no significant change between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, or between the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. It also fails to reject the null hypothesis of no structural break at the end of the pandemic for the number of IBD admissions, and cervical and oesophageal cancer diagnoses. However, the Wald test rejects the null hypothesis for all the other indicators meaning that the structural breaks are statistically significant (Table 1  Table 1 Wald test testing for structural break at start (11th of March 2020) and end (9th of February 2022) of the pandemic Pre-pandemic vs. pandemic Pandemic vs. post-pandemic Chi2 Wald test Chi2 Wald test Diabetes type 2, new diagnoses 6.035 P IBD length of admissions 0.518 P 2.018 P IBD number of admissions 14.643 P 2.017 P Appendicitis diagnoses 26.4 P 29.7330 P Cervical cancer diagnoses 8.058 P 1.69 P Oesophageal cancer diagnoses 6.404 P 2.876 P IBD = inflammatory bowel disease *Statistical significance Discussion In this study, we evaluated the resilience of the Swedish health system by analysing changes in essential health services utilisation before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and by examining sociodemographic differences in utilisation by education and sex. All sectors that were assessed experienced initial disruptions. The analysis of service utilisation over time revealed a mixed picture: Primary care, as indicated by new prescriptions for type 2 diabetes, initially declined but recovered rapidly. Inpatient care for IBD experienced a reduction in admissions, although the duration of hospital stays remained stable. Emergency care, reflected by number of appendicitis diagnoses, showed a surprising increase in cases during the pandemic. Cancer diagnostics were significantly affected, with cervical cancer diagnoses declining markedly throughout the pandemic, while oesophageal cancer diagnoses rebounded swiftly after an initial drop. When examining sociodemographic differences, disruptions varied by education and sex but were generally not large. The results of this study are, to some extent, supported by previous research. One study covering ten different countries assessed changes in outpatient visits, emergency room visits, inpatient admissions, surgeries and trauma admissions during the pandemic finding significant disruptions across a wide range of health services [ 24 22 A decrease in primary care utilisation during the pandemic has been seen in several other contexts [ 7 22 24 An analysis of sociodemographic differences revealed a more nuanced picture. When stratified by education, a more pronounced drop in primary care utilisation was observed among individuals with lower education. This could be explained by barriers such as limited access to healthcare services, lower health literacy, or financial constraints, which may in turn reduce awareness of available services, decrease the frequency of healthcare, or complicate navigation the healthcare system. By contrast, differences between men and women were small, suggesting that sex did not play a major role in primary care utilisation during the pandemic. Inpatient care results are consistent with prior studies in the US, UK, and Germany reporting significant disruptions in inpatient care [ 40 42 43 44 46 47 When examining sociodemographic differences, distinct patterns emerged. When stratified by education, the higher education group had a lower rate of hospitalisation, which may reflect better disease management or lower incidence of the disease in this group in general. Individuals with higher education levels may be more proactive in managing their health, leading to earlier detection of complications. The drop in cases in line with the start of the pandemic was more pronounced in the higher education group indicating that this group may have been more worried about being exposed to the virus during a hospitalisation and therefore taking further precautions to avoid hospitalisation. Despite these differences in hospitalisation rates, the length of hospitalisation for IBD remained unchanged for both groups, indicating that the severity of cases, once admitted, did not differ significantly between the education groups. Although women generally had higher admission rates for IBD than men, the pattern of decline during the pandemic was similar for both groups. This suggests that the pandemic’s effect on inpatient care utilisation was not strongly sex-dependent, but rather influenced by other factors such as education and system adaptations. The pattern of service utilisation over time in emergency care contrasts with reports from other countries. Although there were some early indications from both Sweden and Greece that COVID-19 infection may have increased the risk of appendicitis [ 48 49 50 51 51 52 The service utilisation over time for cervical cancer diagnostics was severely disrupted. The sharp decline in cervical cancer diagnoses due to disrupted screening services aligns with global findings of disrupted cancer care during the pandemic [ 22 24 37 53 22 23 37 53 54 55 54 34 In contrast, the service utilisation over time for oesophageal cancer diagnostics was largely stable. Diagnostics seem to not have been affected as much as cervical cancer by the pandemic. A possible explanation for this is the severe symptoms that patients with this disease usually present with, facilitating its detection even during the pandemic. An analysis of sociodemographic differences revealed subtle patterns. For oesophageal cancer, men showed a more rapid recovery in diagnoses after the initial decline compared to women, who experienced a temporary increase during mid-pandemic. These findings suggest sex-specific dynamics in diagnostic pathways. When stratified by education, a decrease in diagnoses was observed in both higher and lower education groups, with the higher education group having an overall lower incidence of cases. Overall, disruptions to healthcare utilisation during the pandemic differed somewhat by education and sex. A more pronounced drop in type 2 diabetes diagnoses was seen in the lower education group, while IBD admissions fell more steeply in those with higher education. Sex differences, on the other hand, were smaller overall but remained visible: for example, IBD admissions were higher among women throughout, appendicitis more frequent in men, and oesophageal cancer showed slightly different recovery patterns by sex. These findings align with earlier studies suggesting social gradients in delayed care may vary depending on diagnosis and healthcare level [ 56 57 Strengths of the present study include the nationwide population-based coverage of the registers included. The data from the Swedish population-based healthcare registries is considered highly reliable and with high coverage [ 58 59 22 23 32 33 37 53 60 61 62 Perhaps the most important lesson learned from the study of these indicators is how to continue cancer screening and plan ahead before the next health crisis hits. Further research is also needed to better understand whether changes in IBD admissions indicate a failure to recover from the initial shock or simply the system adapting and becoming more efficient in the aftermath of the pandemic. Additional research on potential biological mechanisms between COVID-19 and appendicitis would be valuable. If this were indeed the case, it could be relevant especially in countries that saw a decrease in appendicitis cases meaning that they missed even more cases than previously anticipated. Exploring socioeconomic factors, such as occupation, country of birth, and income, could provide valuable insights into varying health-seeking behaviours and further clarify disparities in healthcare access and utilisation. While this study focuses specifically on Sweden, its findings may also be relevant to other countries that choose to adopt a pandemic response approach similar to Sweden’s in future crises. Overall, the findings emphasise the importance of maintaining routine care during pandemics by adapting quickly to the initial shock to avoid long lasting effects on patients. The health system managed to a large degree cater for the diagnoses observed, independent of educational level. We highlight areas for improvement in crisis preparedness, emphasising the importance to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic to improve the health system’s resilience to be adaptable and to ensure utilisation of health services during future public health emergencies, and the need for future research.
