Although biologics have been used in the clinic for more than eight decades, they are mostly unaffordable, thereby limiting their access to a large global population. The high cost is largely due to their production in cell culture systems (bacteria, yeast, CHO cells) requiring prohibitively expensive fermentation systems, purification of host cell proteins (>99%) to minimize allergic reactions, and instability of purified proteins requiring cold chain/transportation and invasive delivery through injections. Therefore, my lab pioneered the approach to develop recombinant proteins in edible plant cells that could be delivered orally via capsules or topically using chewing gums, eliminating the need for fermentation, purification, or cold chain. FDA approval of biologics bioencapsulated in plant cells has demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the cost of drugs (<5%) and a fraction of the regulatory cost for launching new drugs. Some of the recent advances are discussed in this editorial. 2 Overcoming the Biologics Barrier: Cost, Delivery, and Global Access Biologics are unavailable or unaffordable for a large majority of the global population because of the way they are produced and delivered. The estimated average cost to develop a new biological product is ≈$2.6 billion. [  1 ] [  2  3  4 ] [  5 ] [  2  3 ] Strikingly, the per capita prescription of drug spending in the U.S. is the highest in the world. The interquartile range of biological product prices ranged from $18861 to $288759 between 2008 and 2021. [  2  3  4  5  6 ] [  2  3 ] [  7 ] Insulin has been used in the clinic for eight decades and yet limitations of the truncated form or injectable delivery have not yet been addressed. Insulin injections delivered to the peripheral circulation are a key contributor to hypoglycemia and associated cardiac autonomic neuropathy. [  8 ] [  9 ] [  10 ] [  11 ] Beyond affordability and patient compliance challenges due to invasive drug delivery, injectable proteins face several other challenges. One of the most common challenges is anti‐drug antibodies, especially in recombinant protein injections to treat hemophilia or lysosomal storage diseases. [  12 ] [  2  12 ] 3 Cross‐Kingdom Gene Expression: Translating Plant Platforms into Biopharmaceutical Innovation In early investigations, I developed a foreign gene expression system in chloroplasts using reporter genes. [  13  14 ] [  15  16  17  18 ] [  2  4  19  20  21  22  23 ] In depth knowledge and understanding of genetics and genomics are essential to push boundaries of biotechnology. For example, our early investigations on the expression of human blood proteins in chloroplasts were unsuccessful because of differences in their genomes and protein synthetic machinery. So, the first step was to sequence several chloroplast genomes and understand codon usage/hierarchy of highly expressed genes. [  23  24 ] [  25  26 ] [  2  3  4 ] 4 The Quiet Joys of Recognition: What Really Matters in Science Looking back, the most rewarding moments were receiving late‐night emails from collaborators at the National Institutes of Health or USAMRID stating that “all immunized animals that we shipped survived anthrax or plague aerosol challenge.” It is quite exciting that the vaccines we developed in plants were effective against pathogen challenge. Recognition by peers is also rewarding, especially when they were received unexpectedly. For example, when I was inducted as a Fellow of AAAS, the chair of the nomination committee was unhappy that I wasn't even a member. I had to pay for a Science journal subscription before I received this recognition at the AAAS Boston meeting, 2007. Likewise, my invitation to go to Rome in 2004 to receive the recognition of a Fellow of the oldest National Academy of Sciences in the globe was sent to the wrong addresses. I trashed the envelope, thinking that it was junk mail with several misdelivered stamps. Only later I realize that I was indeed the fourteenth American member in the 250‐year history of this academy, and Benjamin Franklin was the first American. I am now an endowed professor at the University of Pennsylvania, founded by Ben Franklin. However, these days, newly emerging AI tools like Scholar GPS rank provide the least biased quantitative measures of scholarship. Again, I was surprised to be ranked first or in the top ten globally in several fields, including genetic engineering and biopharmaceuticals. However, I encourage my mentees to enjoy recognition when they are received but that shouldn't drive their research ambition. Evaluation of the proposed hypothesis and observing the results of the experimental design are the greatest long‐lasting rewards. 5 Advice to Young Scientists: Think Beyond Your Field, Work Across Systems Based on my career, one key guidance I would offer is to look for multidisciplinary collaboration opportunities to advance one's career. This requires research beyond one's area of expertise or comfort zone. Collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists enhances understanding of mechanistic aspects and the development of treatment options. Let me illustrate this one specific example. One should feel comfortable cloning genes from bacteria, yeast, fungal, human, and animal genomes to explore biotechnology applications. For example, oral cancer is initiated by HPV, anaerobic bacteria ( F. nucleatum P. gingivalis Candida albicans 6 Shaping Research Ecosystems: Journals, Industry, and the Public Sphere Serving as the founding editor (2002) and Editor‐in‐Chief (2012–2022) of Plant Biotechnology Journal (PBJ) has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences in my career. I certainly encouraged multidisciplinary articles that combined plant, animal, and human biology aspects. However, it was challenging to find multidisciplinary expertise within the same reviewer, and therefore, I sent manuscripts to different reviewers to review different sections of the same manuscript. Likewise, I encouraged special issues on genome editing before other journals recognized their importance, and now PBJ is a leading journal in this field, and genome‐edited crops are receiving regulatory approval around the globe. Therefore, I promoted a combination of basic and translational aspects of genomes and genetics. It was quite rewarding to see a young journal surpass hundred‐year‐old journals in ranking and citations. I am delighted to see several of my mentees serving the scientific community in similar roles as Executive Editors or Editors‐in‐Chief in plant science or medical journals. Investigators must utilize knowledge gained from basic science to real‐world applications because most research funding is received from taxpayers. There is a misconception that universities are ivory towers, to focus on fundamental science and industries should focus on translational research. Although I receive most of my funding from federal agencies, I have also been funded for several decades by pharmaceutical companies like Novo Nordisk, Shire, Takeda, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer, startup companies and foundations, including Gates Foundation, Bayer Hemophilia Foundation, and American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association. Industries and foundations fund mostly translational research projects. When mentees are trained in multidisciplinary research and interact with industry, they learn valuable lessons in regulatory approval, documentation, rigor, and reproducibility of observed results, essential to launching products and benefiting the global communities. These days, journalists play a key role in writing news stories that bring breakthrough innovations to the attention of investors. I realized the power of social and news media outlets of well‐written news articles, without exaggeration and scientific jargon, reaching millions of Twitter exchanges or news stories in more than a hundred global languages. Several journals track Altmetric scores and provide authors with global outreach to evaluate the timely impact of scientific publications. Cross‐sector partnerships require coordination of funding agencies, industries, foundations, and publishers. It takes an entire village to change the status quo and break the traditional disciplinary boundaries and silos. 7 Power of International Collaborations Science has no national boundaries. In the past four decades, I have had the privilege of hosting investigators in my lab from all continents. I introduced Associate Editors from all continents when I served as the Editor in Chief of PBJ, which dramatically enhanced journal citation and ranking, especially due to social media exchanges of published articles in different global languages. I also worked hard to convert PBJ to an Open Access Journal so that readers around the globe could have free access, without paying a journal subscription. Although many of my mentees pursue successful careers in academia or industry in the United States, those who return to their home countries have established wonderful research programs. This summer, I was quite impressed by the accomplishments of my mentee, Dr. Shuangxia Jin, Dean at Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, when I gave a keynote address in the 120th Anniversary of Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, organized by Dr. Jin. The following week, I visited India to give a keynote speech organized by another mentee, Dr. Shashi Kumar, at the United National Institute (ICGEB, New Delhi), and thrilled to observe algae from his lab were tested by the first Indian astronaut in space station. These are great examples of international collaborations that require multidisciplinary skills. 8 Beyond Balance: Work and Life as One This topic is discussed a lot more these days, with the misconception that one negatively impacts the other. Indeed, forty years ago, when I moved to the US, many of my postdoctoral colleagues worked late nights, during weekends, and scheduling lab meetings during weekends, especially during the winter months, was challenging. Most of my colleagues never complained and have successful professional and personal lives. Several of my mentees who had children during their graduate or postdoctoral studies had excellent time management skills and are highly successful in their personal and professional lives. In contrast, those who limited their time in the lab due to work‐life balance changed jobs frequently, with an uncertain future. From my personal experience, juggling the responsibility of Editor in Chief of a major journal, reviewing thousands of manuscripts, writing grants to support a very large number of investigators in my lab, responsibilities as founder of biotech companies, prosecution of >100 patents, FDA regulatory approval documentation, teaching and professional travel couldn't be done within 40 h in any week. Even when I am on vacation, I keep thinking of projects, ideas, and outcomes of lab investigations. Therefore, my life and work are deeply integrated and inseparable.
