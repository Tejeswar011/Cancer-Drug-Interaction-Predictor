They enable targeted administration and sustained release of bioactive compounds, minimizing side effects while maximizing efficacy 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Chitosan, a biodegradable and biocompatible polysaccharide derived from chitin, is an exceptional carrier for plant extracts due to its mucoadhesive properties, positive charge, and ability to enhance drug stability and bioavailability 42 43 44 45 46 47 This study aimed to develop an innovative therapeutic approach for amikacin-induced AKI by combining the regenerative potential of MSCs with the enhanced delivery of Aloe vera Aloe vera Aloe vera in vivo Aloe vera’s Materials and methods Aloe vera extraction method Aloe vera Aloe barbadensis http://www.theplantlist.org Aloe vera Nanoparticles Preparation Aloe vera extract nanoparticles (AVENPS) Five g of AVE powder were weighed and placed in a container with 20 mL of 38% HCl solution 39 in vivo While numerous advanced methods for generating carrier-free nanoparticles exist- such as flash nanoprecipitation for superior size control 48 49 50 51 39 52 39 52 39 52 Aloe vera extract loaded Chitosan nanoparticles (AVE-CSNPS) AVE-CSNPS were prepared using a modified ionic gelation method optimized for bioactive compounds encapsulation 47 53 54 Aloe vera Determination of total phenolic content (TPC) The TPC of AVE, AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method. Samples were prepared by dissolving 1 mg/mL in methanol, followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and filtration to remove particulates. The assay was performed by mixing 100 µL of sample with 500 µL of freshly prepared 10% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, vortexing for 30 s, and incubating for 5 min at 25 °C in the dark. Subsequently, 400 µL of 7.5% sodium carbonate solution was added, and the mixture was incubated for 60 min. The result was read at 765 nm and expressed as mg GAE/g. Determination of total flavonoid content (TFC) The TFC of the samples (AVE, AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS) was quantitatively determined using the aluminum chloride colorimetric method with quercetin as the reference standard. In brief, 0.5 mL of diluted sample was mixed with 1.5 mL of 95% ethanol, followed by addition of 0.1 mL of 10% aluminum chloride solution, 0.1 mL of 1 M potassium acetate, and 2.8 mL of distilled water. The reaction mixture was vortexed thoroughly and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min in the dark to allow for complete color development. The absorbance was then measured at 415 nm and the result was expressed as mg QE/g. Determination of encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and drug loading (DL%) The EE% and DL% capacity of AVE-CSNPS was evaluated using validated analytical methods 54 54 For the AVE-CSNPS, classical encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and drug loading (DL%) were determined, as a distinct polymer carrier matrix entraps the bioactive compounds. In contrast, the carrier-free AVENPS are composed solely of self-assembled Aloe vera Characterization of AVE and AVENPS Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis The phytochemical profiles of AVE, AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS were characterized using a Thermo Scientific Trace GC1310-ISQ mass spectrometer equipped with an advanced TG-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film thickness). The analytical method was optimized for maximum resolution of bioactive compounds with the following temperature program: initial oven temperature: 50 °C (held for 2 min), ramp 1: 10 °C/min to 230 °C (held for 2 min) and ramp 2: 5 °C/min to 290 °C (held for 2 min final elution). Ultra-high purity helium carrier gas was maintained at a constant flow rate (1.0 mL/min) to ensure optimal peak separation. The injector port was set at 250 °C in split mode (20:1) with a 1 µL injection volume, while the mass spectrometer interface and ion source were stabilized at 260 °C to prevent condensation of high-boiling-point compounds. To minimize solvent interference, a 3-minute solvent delay was used prior to mass spectral acquisition. The ISQ single quadrupole mass detector operated in electron impact mode at 70 eV, scanning a mass range of 50–650 m/z with a 0.2 s/scan rate. System calibration was performed using perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) for mass accuracy verification. Data acquisition and processing were conducted via Thermo Scientific Xcalibur™ software (v4.0), with compound identification achieved by matching mass spectra against the NIST 17 Mass Spectral Library (match threshold > 85%) and verified with authentic standards when available. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis The phenolic and bioactive component profiles of AVE, AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS were analyzed using a HPLC system (Agilent 1260 series) equipped with a quaternary pump, thermostatted column compartment, and diode array detector (DAD). Separation was achieved on an Eclipse Plus C18 reversed-phase column (4.6 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm particle size) maintained at 40 °C for optimal peak resolution and reproducibility. The mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in ultrapure water and (B) acetonitrile, delivered at a constant flow rate (0.9 mL/min) using the following linear gradient elution program: 0–5 min: 82% A → 80% A, 5–8 min: 80% A → 60% A, 8–12 min: 60% A → 82% A and 12–20 min: 82% A (column re-equilibration). A 5 µL volume of filtered sample was injected in partial loop mode to ensure precision. Detection was performed at 280 nm using DAD, with simultaneous monitoring at 254 and 320 nm to confirm peak purity. Data acquisition and processing were conducted using Agilent OpenLAB CDS ChemStation software, with peak identification based on retention time matching and UV spectral comparison against authenticated reference compounds. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis For determination of the elemental composition in AVE, AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS, ICP was used after an ashing process. Dried samples (2.5 g) was burned in stages up to 570 °C, then the produced ash was treated with a mixture of acids (HCl and HNO 3 2 2 3 In vitro characterization For both the coagulation and anti-inflammatory assays, fresh rat blood was collected in-house from healthy adult male Sprague Dawley rats (weighing 200–250 g) bred in the institutional animal facility of Faculty of Science, Cairo University. The rats were housed under standard conditions (12-h light/dark cycle, 25 ± 2 °C, 50–60% humidity) with ad libitum access to water and chow. Blood was drawn via cardiac puncture under anesthesia (50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital) following the approved protocol (CU-IACUC approval no. CUIF6122). Heparinized blood (for anti-inflammatory assays) and citrate-anticoagulated plasma (for coagulation tests) were prepared immediately after collection. All procedures adhered to the ARRIVE guidelines and institutional ethical standards for animal welfare, minimizing discomfort and sample variability. Rats were used instead of mice for practical considerations where larger blood volume/animal (rats vs. mice) allowed for sufficient sample replicates without requiring excessive animal numbers. All in vitro assays were validated to ensure reproducibility and sensitivity. Reproducibility was confirmed by performing each experiment in triplicate ( n In vitro antioxidant activity The DPPH antioxidant assay is a gold-standard, widely validated method in phytochemistry. Our protocol followed the classic methodology of Blois 55 In vitro coagulation activity The clotting assays [PT (prothrombin time) and PTT (partial thromboplastin time)] were conducted using commercial diagnostic kits from recognized manufacturers, which are pre-validated for accuracy and reproducibility in clinical and research settings. The use of citrate-anticoagulated rat plasma and strict temperature control (37 °C) are critical standard practices for these assays 56 In vitro anti-inflammatory (membrane stabilization) assay The hemolysis (membrane stabilization) assay is a recognized model for estimating anti-inflammatory activity in vitro 57 2 In vitro cytotoxicity (MTT) assay HEK-293 cell line (100 µL/well, 10 5 2 Bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells The mouse BM-MSCs cells (sixth passage) were purchased from Cyagen, USA (MUBMX-01001). BM-MSCs were isolated from the C57BL/6 mouse’s healthy bone marrow, demonstrating a strong differentiation and proliferation capacity. Following the manufacturer’s guidelines, the flow cytometry findings indicated that CD117 and CD31 were negative (< 5%). Conversely, more than 70% of Sca-1, CD29, and CD44 tests were positive. Experimental design Male BALB/c mice were purchased from the animal house colony, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt; and kept under standard experimental condition (22 ± 2 °C, 12 h dark/light cycle and 50 ± 2% humidity) for one week for acclimatization. Animals were fed standard mouse chow and water ad libitum, throughout the experimental time; and the work was performed in line with the ARRIVE guidelines 2.0. The sample size was calculated by power analysis method and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Cairo University (CU-IACUC) under the number (CUIF6122). The required number of animals in each group have to be < 6 to accomplish 80% power with a 0.05 significance. The researchers performing the following experiments and statistics analysis were blinded to groups’ allocations. The selection of administration routes was based on the biological and physicochemical nature of each therapeutic agent. MSCs require intravenous (IV) delivery to ensure viability, systemic distribution, and homing to the injured kidney, as oral administration would result in their complete degradation within the gastrointestinal tract. Conversely, Aloe vera Thirty five BALB/c mice were randomly allocated into seven groups (5 mice/group): group I: healthy negative control mice (NC), group II: untreated amikacin induced-kidney injured mice (positive control) (PC), group III: amikacin induced-kidney injured mice treated with MSCs (AMK-MSCs), group IV: amikacin induced-kidney injured mice treated with MSCs and AVE (AMK-MSCs/AVE), group V: amikacin induced-kidney injured mice treated with MSCs and AVENPS (AMK-MSCs/AVENPS), group VI: amikacin induced-kidney injured mice treated with MSCs and CSNPS (AMK-MSCs/CSNPS), and group VII: amikacin induced-kidney injured mice treated with MSCs and AVE-CSNPS (AMK-MSCs/AVE-CSNPS). Kidney injury induction was performed according to Batoo et al 58 6 Analysis of kidney function In the serum samples, urea, creatinine and uric acid were measured by colorimetric kits (ab83362, ab65340 and ab65344, respectively; abcam, USA). For the collection of urine samples, the animals were placed separately in metabolic cages (with free access to water) overnight. Albumin was determined by colorimetric kit (abx298891, abbexa, UK) in the urine samples. Oxidative stress measurements Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in kidney tissue homogenates using ELISA kits (MBS741034 and MBS2707323, respectively; MyBioSource, USA). ELISA procedures followed the manufacturer’s guidelines and precautions. Immunological measurements Inflammatory markers (IL-1β, TNF-α, CRP, and IL-6) and the anti-inflammatory marker (IL-4) were measured in kidney tissue homogenates using ELISA kits (ab197742, ab208348, ab222511, ab222503 and ab100710, respectively; Abcam, UK). ELISA procedures followed the manufacturer’s guidelines and precautions. Statistical analysis Units were chosen based on the standard reporting conventions and sensitivity ranges for each specific assay kit to accurately reflect the biological concentrations of the respective biomarkers. The data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and given as means ± standard deviations (SD). The Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used to evaluate mean differences, and results were deemed statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05. No animal was excluded from the analysis ( n Results Phytochemical composition of AVE, AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS GC-MS analysis The GC-MS analysis showed significant differences in the phytochemical profiles among AVE, AVENPS, and AVE-CSNPS with respect to the abundance of key bioactive components. Hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) was the dominant compound in all samples (AVE: 14.73%, AVENPS: 13.60% and AVE-CSNPS: 14.53%). Also, methyl 12-hydroxyoctadecenoate showed a high abundance across samples (AVE: 14.3%, AVENPS: 13.4% and AVE-CSNPS: 14.22%). Most compounds showed < 15% variation between AVE and AVENPS. 10-Octadecenoic acid methyl ester maintained similar levels between AVE (11.51%) and AVENPS (11.07%). Stearic acid content was nearly identical in AVE and AVENPS (6.31% and 6.00%, respectively). In addition, slight decreases were observed in AVENPS for some compounds such as 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid methyl ester (AVE: 0.82% Vs. AVENPS: 0.51%), octadecanoic acid methyl ester (AVE: 1.49% Vs. AVENPS: 1.17%) and the permethylated glycolipid derivative (AVE: 0.16% Vs. AVENPS: 0.33%). AVE-CSNPS contained intermediate values for most phytochemical components between AVE and AVENPS (Table 1 HPLC analysis HPLC quantification of phenolic compounds revealed excellent preservation of bioactive constituents in both AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS compared to the AVE (Table 2 ICP-MS analysis ICP-MS analysis revealed significant differences in the elemental composition of AVE, AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS (Table 3 Heavy metal analysis showed that lead decreased from 1.30 ppm in AVE to 0.50 ppm in AVENPS, with AVE-CSNPS at an intermediate level (1.03 ppm). Nickel and cobalt were completely absent in AVENPS but present in trace amounts in AVE (1.73 and 0.66 ppm, respectively) and AVE-CSNPS (0 and 0.04 ppm, respectively). Chromium levels dropped significantly from 2.23 ppm in AVE to near-undetectable levels in both nanoparticle formulations. Silver and mercury were absent in all samples, confirming the safety of the formulations. These results demonstrated that while nanoparticle preparation reduced certain elemental concentrations, CSNPS loading mitigated these losses, particularly for essential minerals. The near-complete removal of toxic heavy metals (Ni, Co, Cr) in AVENPS and AVE-CSNPS suggested a purification effect during nanoencapsulation, while AVE-CSNPS maintained a balanced mineral profile closer to the original extract.

Physical properties Particle size distribution DLS analysis showed distinct size distributions for the prepared nanoparticles (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 DLS ( A B C Surface charge (zeta potential) Zeta potential measurements in Figure (1 C) demonstrated that AVENPS had a moderately negative charge (− 22.8 mV), attributed to the anionic functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl) in AVE constituents. In contrast, CSNPS displayed a positive charge (27.35 mV) due to the protonated amino groups of chitosan. Remarkably, the AVE-CSNPS showed a higher positive zeta potential (31.92 mV) than unloaded CSNPS, suggesting that AVE components may have synergistically enhanced the surface charge, possibly through interactions that exposed additional cationic sites on chitosan or reduced aggregation-induced charge masking. This elevated positive charge further reinforced the formulation’s potential for mucoadhesion, colloidal stability, and cellular uptake. EE%, DL% and retention efficiency The phytochemical analysis revealed distinct patterns in bioactive compound recovery between nanoparticle formulations (Table 4  Table 4 Comparative analysis of TPC, TFC, EE%, DL%, and retention efficiency in AVE, AVENPS, and AVE-CSNPS.

The AMK-MSCs/CSNPS group showed intermediate effects, suggesting that the combination of AVE-CSNPS with MSCs provided the most comprehensive renoprotection. These findings highlighted the synergistic potential of AVE-CSNPS in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs for kidney injury, possibly through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and regenerative mechanisms.

In contrast, AMK-MSCs/CSNPS had more modest effects (MDA: 7.8 ± 0.6 nmol/mg tissue; SOD: 54.2 ± 4.3 U/mg tissue), underscoring the critical role of Aloe vera Inflammatory markers The evaluation of inflammatory mediators revealed a robust anti-inflammatory effect of the combined MSCs and AVE-CSNPS therapy, demonstrating superior modulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared to other treatment groups (Fig. 5 The AMK-MSCs/AVENPS group showed particularly strong suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α: 646.4 ± 6.8 pg/g tissue; IL-6: 181.6 ± 5.4 pg/g tissue), suggesting enhanced bioavailability of Aloe vera Aloe vera  Fig. 5 cytokine levels in kidney tissue showing IL-1β (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) p Discussion Traditional herbal medicine has utilized plant-derived phytochemicals for centuries due to their therapeutic benefits, minimal side effects, and cost-effectiveness 59 60 61 62 63 64 The present study successfully developed and characterized two nanoformulations of Aloe vera 65 66 67 68 69 The nanoparticle yield from the AVENPS process was sufficient for the comprehensive preclinical assessments conducted in this study. However, it is acknowledged that the acid precipitation method, while ideal for generating a carrier-free comparator for mechanistic studies, presents challenges for large-scale therapeutic production. These include the need for extensive purification (dialysis) and its relatively lower retention efficiency. In contrast, the ionic gelation method employed for AVE-CSNPS is recognized for its greater potential for scalability and was a key factor in its selection as the lead therapeutic candidate from this work. The physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles revealed crucial structure-function relationships that determined their therapeutic potential. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that AVE-CSNPS (40.52 nm) were larger than both AVENPS (27.04 nm) and unloaded CSNPS (35.36 nm), consistent with successful encapsulation of AVE within the chitosan matrix as reported by Abreu et al 70 71 72 73 74 75 Aloe vera in vivo The in vitro 47 53 76 77 47 53 The therapeutic potential of MSCs is significantly constrained by several critical limitations, including poor post-transplantation survival rates, inefficient homing to injury sites following systemic administration, variable secretory activity dependent on local cytokine environments, and incompletely understood mechanisms of action 78 80 81 82 83 84 85 87 The in vivo Aloe vera Aloe vera in vivo 88 89 90 Aloe vera 54 Notably, the superior in vivo in vitro in vivo In conclusion, the study demonstrated that AVE-CSNPS synergistically enhanced MSCs therapy for kidney injury by preserving the phytochemical integrity, improving bioavailability, and amplifying antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects more than AVE or AVENPS. While this study demonstrated the synergistic effect of AVE-CSNPS and MSCs therapy for kidney injury, certain strategic considerations need further exploration. The current findings were based on a well-established amikacin-induced AKI model, which, while highly reproducible, does not fully recapitulate the complexity of chronic kidney disease progression in humans. Additionally, the 4-week treatment period, though sufficient to observe significant therapeutic effects, may not reveal long-term outcomes such as tissue remodeling or potential late-stage immune responses. Finally, the doses were administered based on the equivalent mass of the initial crude extract; future studies normalizing doses to bioactive content could provide further mechanistic insight. These aspects, however, did not diminish the validity of the observed synergistic mechanisms but rather highlighted opportunities for future research. Subsequent studies could extend these findings by employing progressive fibrosis models to evaluate long-term renoprotection and investigating dose-escalation protocols to optimize the therapeutic period with high-resolution histopathological analysis. Such targeted investigations would further strengthen the translational potential of this combinatorial approach while building upon the robust foundation established in this work.
