AQP5 competitively binds DHX9 with KPNB1 to inhibit the nuclear translocation of the transcriptional regulatory protein, DHX9, and downregulate the expression of the key enzyme ASS1 and L-arginine production. p Considering that AQP5 transcriptionally inhibits ASS1 in GC cells, we screened transcription factors or regulatory factors mediating this effect using reverse chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses ( Table S8 Figure S13 Figures 3 Figure 3 Figure S13 Figure S13 Figure S13 19 Figures 3 Figure S13 Most cytoplasmic proteins are transferred to the nucleus via nuclear transporter proteins. 20 Table S9 Figure S14 Figures 3 S14 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figures S14 Figures 3 Figure 3 Decreased L-arginine in the TME limits NO synthesis in NK cells weakening their anti-tumor ability L-arginine is a substrate for the production of polyamines, creatine, and proline, essential for cell survival and proliferation. We therefore assessed the metabolic alterations in NK cells following L-arginine treatment using untargeted metabolomics. However, L-arginine supplementation did not significantly increase polyamine, ornithine, creatine, or proline in NK cells ( Table S10 The synthesis of NO by NK cells is mediated by constitutively expressing the endothelial NOS (nitric oxide synthase), which supports their cytotoxic functions. 21 + Figures 4 S15 + Figures 4 S15 Figures S15 Figure S15 Figure 4 Explore the mechanism of AQP5 + (A) NO OD(optical density) value in NK cells co-cultured with AQP5 + − n (B–D) NO OD value (B); proliferative capacity (C); and cytotoxicity (D) in NK cells co-cultured with AQP5 + − + n (E–K) Images (E), tumor volume (F), tumor incidence (G), L-arginine levels (H), NK cell proportion (I), proportion of TNF-α + + fl/fl fl/fl cre fl/fl fl/fl cre n (L and M) Representative images (L) and statistical analysis (M) of metastatic nodules in the lungs established with AQP5-overexpressed MFC cells in Inos fl/fl fl/fl cre fl/fl fl/fl cre n p Then, we further analyzed whether the low-arginine TME created by AQP5 + fl/fl cre/- fl/fl fl/fl cre/- Figure S16 fl/fl Figures 4 + + fl/fl fl/fl cre/- Figures 4 fl/fl cre/- fl/fl Figures 4 + Decreased L-arginine anabolism promotes the TCA cycle in AQP5 + Arginine affects cellular bioenergetics, including ATP levels, the ADP/ATP ratio, and oxygen consumption rates (OCRs). 22 + – Figure 5 + + Figures 5 + Figure S17 + Figure 5 Evaluate the effect of AQP5 on the bioenergy of GC cells (A) L-Arginine uptake ratio in AQP5 + − n (B) Intracellular ATP levels in AQP5 + − n (C and D) Oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) of AQP5 + − n (E) L-glutamic acid level detected by targeted metabolic mass spectrometry in tumor tissues expressing AQP5 ( n (F) Amino acid levels in AQP5 + − n (G) Schematic diagram of the TCA cycle and UC.

All cell lines were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 Table S1 Method details Cell sorting We designed single-guide RNAs targeting the 3′ end of the AQP5 gene. A donor plasmid containing a mCherry coding sequence flanked by homology arms matching the AQP5 genomic region was constructed. The sgRNA (carrying puromycin resistance), Cas9, and donor plasmid (carrying neomycin resistance) were co-transfected into target cells. After 48–72 h, cells were screened for fluorescence to identify successful knock-in. The transfected cells were subjected to antibiotic selection to identify positive cells. Subsequently, the cells were sorted based on mCherry fluorescence intensity: mCherryhigh cells were designated as AQP5+, while mCherrylow/non cells were designated as AQP5-. The sorted populations were collected and used for downstream experiments. Reverse-ChIP The reverse-chip kit was utilized for this study. Cells (3 × 10 8 Table S8 Tumor dissociation and single-cell preparation Subcutaneous tumors were aseptically harvested from tumor-bearing mice and placed in cold PBS supplemented with 2% FBS.

After the addition of arginine, the cells were incubated for 24 h. Arginine concentration in the culture medium was assessed using ELISA. The arginine uptake ratio was calculated as follows: 1- (concentration of arginine in the final medium sample - concentration of arginine secreted by the cells)/concentration of arginine added initially. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing scRNA sample collection, library preparation, and sequencing Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed by Genedenovo Biotech Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China) utilizing the Illumina platform. Tumors from AQP5+ and AQP5- MFC cells were transplanted into C57B6/J mice and excised after 28 days for analysis. The tumors were cut into 1 mm 3 scRNA-seq data processing Raw sequencing data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was processed with Cell Ranger 3.0.2 (10x Genomics). The scRNA-seq data was screened to generate a gene expression matrix using DNBelab C series scRNA analysis software (MGI). The reference genome (Ensemble assembly: Sscrofal1.1) was downloaded for this analysis. Cells were preserved based on the following criteria: detection of over 200 and under 5,000 genes, with mitochondrial gene expression (MT%) limited to below 30%. Following the generation of the unique molecular identifier (UMI) count profile, quality control and subsequent analyses were conducted using Seurat 3.0. Gene expression for each cell was normalized with the “LogNormalize” method, which scales total expression by a factor of 10,000 and applies a logarithmic transformation. For data alignment, 1,000 highly variable genes were selected from each matrix, and the ‘FindIntegrationAnchors' and ‘IntegrateData' functions in Seurat were implemented. Clustering was achieved with the “FindClusters” function to identify sub-cell type clusters. t-SNE visualizations depicted the clusters from datasets originating from two donors. The “FindAllMarkers” function in Seurat was applied to identify differentially expressed marker genes in each cluster, utilizing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for statistical analysis. Flow cytometry Tissues or adherent cells were converted into single-cell suspensions and stained with the antibodies listed in key resources table Tissue microarrays construction Tissue microarrays were constructed from gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues (Shanghai Biochip Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The arrays were stained for AQP5, EPCAM, CD3, CD56, and ASS1. Two pathologists independently evaluated the staining intensity and the level of protein expression across the sections. qPCR Total RNA was extracted and purified with RNA Easy Isolation Reagent (Vazyme) following the manufacturer’s protocol. One microgram of total RNA was then reverse transcribed using the PrimeScript RT Kit (Vazyme). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) was conducted with the SYBR qPCR Mastermix Kit (Vazyme). Primer sequences are listed in Table S1 Targeted metabolomics UHPLC-MS/MS high-throughput targeted metabolomics of cell supernatants Metabolite extraction from cell supernatants The samples were thawed in an ice-water bath and vortexed for 30 s. A 50 μL aliquot from each sample was transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Following this, 200 μL of pre-cooled extraction solution (acetonitrile-methanol, 1:1, with isotopically labeled internal standards at −40°C) was added, and the mixture was vortexed for an additional 30 s before sonication for 15 min in the ice-water bath. After incubation at −40°C for 1 h, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (RCF = 13,800 × g, R = 8.6 cm) for 15 min at 4°C. A 100 μL aliquot of the resulting clear supernatant was then transferred to an auto-sampler vial for UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. UHPLC-MS/MS high-throughput targeted metabolomics of cell sediment samples Metabolites extraction from cell sediment An extraction solution (1,000 μL) composed of pre-cooled acetonitrile-methanol-water (2:2:1) with an isotopically labeled internal standard was added to the sample. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and then chilled in dry ice. A freeze-thaw cycle was performed three times using liquid nitrogen, followed by an additional 30-s vortex and 15 min of sonication in an ice-water bath. The samples were then incubated at −40°C for 1 h. Centrifugation was carried out at 12,000 rpm (RCF = 13,800 × g, R = 8.6 cm) and 4°C for 15 min. Finally, a 100 μL aliquot of the clear supernatant was transferred to an auto-sampler vial for UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. UHPLC-MRM-MS analysis UHPLC separation was achieved using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II system equipped with a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm). Mobile phase A comprised 1% formic acid in water, and mobile phase B was 1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The column temperature was maintained at 35°C, with the auto-sampler set to 4°C and an injection volume of 1 μL. An Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, outfitted with an AJS electrospray ionization interface, facilitated assay development. Key ion source parameters included capillary voltages of +4000/-3500 V, nozzle voltages of +500/-500 V, nitrogen gas temperature of 300°C, gas flow rate of 5 L/min, sheath gas temperature of 250°C, sheath gas flow rate of 11 L/min, and nebulizer pressure of 45 psi. MRM parameters were optimized via flow injection analysis using standard solutions of the individual analytes introduced into the mass spectrometer’s API source. The most sensitive transitions were determined during MRM scans, allowing for the optimization of collision energy for each Q1/Q3 pair. Q1/Q3 pairs exhibiting the highest sensitivity and selectivity were designated as “quantifiers” for quantitative analysis, while additional transitions served as “qualifiers” to confirm the identity of the target analytes. Data acquisition and processing were performed using Agilent MassHunter Work Station Software (B.08.00). Untargeted metabolomics Metabolite extraction for untargeted analysis Approximately 107 cultured cells were harvested, followed by the addition of 800 μL of cold methanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) to precipitate proteins and extract metabolites. The resulting mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was carefully collected, and the remaining solution was evaporated using a vacuum centrifuge at 4°C. For liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, the dried samples were reconstituted in 100 μL of acetonitrile/water (1:1, v/v) and placed into LC vials. LC-MS analysis Polar metabolites were analyzed in untargeted metabolomics using a Sciex TripleTOF 6600 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer, coupled with hydrophilic interaction chromatography via electrospray ionization (ESI). Liquid chromatography was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm; Waters, Ireland) employing a gradient of solvent A (25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM ammonium hydroxide in water) and solvent B (acetonitrile). The mass spectrometer operated in both negative and positive ionization modes, utilizing information-dependent acquisition for product ion scans in high-sensitivity mode. Parameters included fixed collision energy at 35V ± 15 eV, declustering potentials of 60 V for positive and −60 V for negative modes, exclusion of isotopes within 4 Da, and monitoring of 10 candidate ions per cycle. Cell proliferation assay For cell proliferation assays, 2,000 cells were plated in each well of 96-well plates. Daily assessments of cell viability were conducted over four days using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (GLPBIO), following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Absorbance readings at OD450 were recorded to create cell growth curves. Additionally, cell proliferation was analyzed using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) with the CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit (Thermo Fisher). Sorted lymphocytes were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 5% FBS at 1 × 106 cells/mL and incubated with 1.25 μM CFSE for 5 min at room temperature. After thorough washing, the stained cells were cultured in medium for 6 to 7 days. Cell division was quantified by measuring the reduction in CFSE fluorescence using flow cytometry. Immunochemistry Human tissues embedded in paraffin were deparaffinized using xylene, and antigen retrieval was achieved by boiling the samples for 20 min. The tissues were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Afterward, secondary antibodies were applied for 30 min at room temperature, and staining was finalized with an EnVision-HRP kit. Differential protein display analysis Cells were lysed with WB&IP buffer (Beyotime) containing protease inhibitors (Boster Biological Technology). A total of 20 μg of protein from each sample was combined with 5× loading buffer and heated for 5 min. Proteomic analysis was performed using iTRAQ (Shanghai OE Biotech Co., Ltd). Differential expression was defined by a p Co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting Cells were lysed with WB&IP buffer (Beyotime) containing protease inhibitors (Boster Biological Technology). The resulting lysates were subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4°C with designated primary antibodies, followed by either protein A/G precipitation for 2 h or incubation with magnetic beads linked to tagged antibodies (Biomake). The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted in SDS sample buffer. The eluted immune complexes were separated via SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Equal protein amounts were loaded onto 7.5%, 10%, or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated overnight with specific primary antibodies. Following three washes with 1× TBST buffer, secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Signal detection was performed using Luminata Crescendo western horseradish peroxidase substrate (Vazyme). Immunofluorescence A total of 1 × 105 cells were cultured in a 24-well plate with pre-inserted slides. After 48 h, the culture medium was removed. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Blocking was achieved with 5% BSA. Primary antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. Following this, a fluorescent secondary antibody, diluted in the blocking solution, was applied in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 5 min, and the slides were mounted using fluorescent mounting medium. An upright fluorescence microscope was used to observe and assess the positive cell staining index. ChIP assay A ChIP assay was performed on AGS cells using the ChIP kit (Abcam, #ab117137) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The promoter region of the ASS1 gene, which contains the DHX9 regulatory element, was immunoprecipitated with an anti-DHX9 antibody, using rabbit IgG as a control. The resulting purified DNA fragments underwent real-time PCR with primers specific to the ASS1 promoter. The ChIP signal from the anti-DHX9 antibody was normalized to the IgG control signal to determine the fold change. Details of the primers used are provided in Table S1 Luciferase reporter assays The pGL3-ASS1-promoter recombinant luciferase reporter vector and pRL-TK plasmid were co-transfected into AGS cells to perform a dual luciferase reporter assay, with pRL-TK serving as an internal control. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and relative light units were quantified using a Promega luciferase assay kit. Luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase fluorescence intensity. Protein profiling Cells were lysed with WB&IP buffer (Beyotime) containing protease inhibitors (Boster Biological Technology). A total of 20 μg of protein from each sample was combined with 5× loading buffer and heated for 5 min. Proteins were separated via 12.5% SDS-PAGE at a constant current of 14 mA for 90 min. Visualization of protein bands was achieved using Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Trypsin digestion was performed on the proteins. The resulting peptides were desalted using C18 cartridges (Empore SPE Cartridges, standard density, bed I.D. 7 mm, 3 mL volume; Sigma), concentrated via vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted in 40 μL of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed with a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The raw MS data for each sample were compiled and analyzed for identification and quantification using MaxQuant software (FDR <1%, ≥2 unique peptides). Cell migration assay Assays were performed using 24-well Transwell plates with 8-μm polyethylene terephthalate membrane filters (Falcon, Becton-Dickinson). In the upper chamber, 105 cells were seeded in serum-free DMEM, while the lower chamber contained DMEM with 15% FBS. Cells were permitted to migrate for 18 h. Migrated cells on the lower filter surface were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 1% crystal violet, and counted in three randomly chosen fields via microscopy. NK cell cytotoxicity assay The CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Kit was utilized to assess the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. In this assay, target cells (1.5×10 4 5 ATP measurement ATP levels were quantified using the ATP Determination Kit, following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Arginine/glutamine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Arginine and glutamine concentrations in mouse or human tissues and cellular lysates were determined using the L-arginine/Glutamine kit following the manufacturer’s guidelines. NO activity assay Cells were collected and resuspended in diluted DAF-FM DA at a concentration of 107cells/mL, followed by a 20-min incubation at 37°C in a cell culture incubator. This process was carried out in a centrifuge tube, with the tube inverted every 3 to 5 min to maximize interaction between the probe and the cells. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) to eliminate any unincorporated DAF-FM DA. Fluorescence intensity was then assessed using a microplate reader. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) assay Cells were plated in an XF96 cell culture microplate at a density of 104 cells per well, with three replicates. On the same day, 180 μL of hydration solution from the XF96 Extracellular Flux Assay Kits was added to the lower compartment, and the cells were hydrated overnight at 37°C in a CO2-free incubator. The Seahorse XF Basic Medium was prepared, with its pH adjusted to 7.4. The following day, cells were washed twice with Seahorse XF Basic Medium, and 175 μL of the medium was added to each well, followed by a 1-h incubation at 37°C in a CO2-free environment. Drugs, including Oligomycin, DMSO, FCCP, DMSO, Antimycin A, and Rotenone, were diluted to the desired concentrations and introduced into the upper layer of the XF96 Extracellular Flux Assay Kits, with 25 μL added to each well. After 30 min, the XF96 kits were removed, and the lower layer was substituted with a cell plate that had been incubated in a 37°C CO2-free incubator for 1 h before analysis.
