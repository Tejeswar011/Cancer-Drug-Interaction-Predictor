Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most significant and rapidly growing chronic diseases worldwide, affecting an estimated 537 million adults in 2021, with projections reaching 783 million by 2045 [ 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 7 8 9 Medicinal plants (MPs) have been integral to human healthcare systems for millennia, forming the basis of both traditional and modern therapeutics [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 Lawsonia inermis Nigella sativa Ziziphus spina-christi Allium cepa Allium sativum Cymbopogon schoenanthus Matricaria aurea Phoenix dactylifera Portulaca oleracea Reichardia tingitana Salvadora persica Solanum lycopersicum Trigonella foenum-graecum Withania somnifera Ziziphus lotus 14 15 16 The therapeutic relevance of MPs extends beyond metabolic disorders. In dermatology, plant-based formulations have shown promise in promoting hair growth and managing alopecia through mechanisms such as enhancing microcirculation, modulating inflammatory pathways, and reducing oxidative stress (Alopecia and the Role of Herbal Medicine in Hair Growth Promotion: Mechanisms, Efficacy, and Safety). These multi-target actions align with the principles of integrative medicine, which favor interventions capable of addressing interconnected pathological processes [ 17 Several MPs traditionally used in the UAE have been validated for antidiabetic activity through in vitro, in vivo, and limited clinical studies.

The search included combinations of keywords such as “ Capparis spinosa Citrullus colocynthis Morus alba Rhazya stricta 2.2. Study Selection Studies were included if they focused on at least one of the selected medicinal plants and provided original data on their antidiabetic or metabolic effects. Eligible studies also reported phytochemical profiles or mechanisms of action and were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Studies were excluded if they lacked experimental or clinical relevance, addressed unrelated health outcomes, were non-English without translation, or consisted of narrative reviews without original research data. 2.3. Data Extraction Data from the included studies were extracted based on plant species, bioactive constituents, mechanisms of antidiabetic activity, and observed outcomes. Information related to study design, dosage, and safety was also recorded. The findings were synthesized thematically and organized according to the plant species selected. A narrative approach was applied to analyze and present the collective evidence. 3. Phytochemical Profiles of the Selected Plants 3.1. Capparis spinosa Caper is a versatile perennial plant that is native to the UAE, thriving in mountainous areas, rocky terrains, limestone formations, wadis, and roadsides, with a flowering period from February to April [ 23 19 24 18 20 25 The nutraceutical value of caper has been highlighted through its potential as a natural antioxidant and preservative in food systems. Research has demonstrated that its bioactive compounds enhance food preservation, packaging, and safety, making it a valuable addition to innovative food technologies [ 19 26 27 26 Furthermore, a comparative metabolomic study of wild and cultivated caper from Sardinia reveals significant qualitative and quantitative differences in the bioactive compounds across plant parts, including buds, flowers, and leaves. The findings reveal high levels of glucosinolates, with glucocapparin and rutin as prominent compounds that contribute to their anticarcinogenic and antioxidant properties [ 28 Quantitative studies have reported that the total flavonoid content in caper fruit extracts ranges from 10.3 to 14.6 mg quercetin equivalents (QE)/g. In contrast, the total phenolic content ranges from 22.4 to 34.9 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g, depending on the extraction method and geographic origin [ 5 19 29 30 4 In summary, caper stands out as a plant of remarkable nutritional, medicinal, and industrial significance. Its multifaceted benefits, including its functional properties in food preservation and its array of health-promoting activities, make it an excellent candidate for ongoing scientific research and commercial development ( Figure 1 3.2. Citrullus colocynthis Bitter apple is a valuable perennial plant that is widely distributed in desert regions; it is native to the UAE, where it thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, flowering from May to October [ 23 31 32 33 21 32 34 35 36 Recent research has highlighted the diverse biological activities of bitter apple, which include antioxidant, cytotoxic, antidiabetic, antilipidemic, insecticidal, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties [ 21 32 37 38 39 40 Apart from its pharmacological significance, the bitter apple holds substantial nutritional value. Its seeds are rich in protein, essential minerals, and edible oils, hence making it a necessary resource for nutraceutical development [ 41 Phytochemical analyses of bitter apple fruit have identified cucurbitacin E as a major triterpenoid, with concentrations reaching up to 3.7 mg/g in methanolic extracts [ 38 21 37 42 43 Bitter apple offers immense potential for medicinal, nutritional, and industrial applications. Its bioactive compound profile, traditional uses, and recent scientific evidence establish it as a promising candidate for further research and commercial exploitation in addressing various health and environmental challenges ( Figure 1 3.3. Morus alba White mulberries are a versatile perennial tree. Renowned for its traditional and medicinal uses, white mulberry has been extensively cultivated, including on private farms in the UAE. It thrives in the UAE’s climate, flowering between March and June [ 23 44 45 Phytochemical studies reveal that white mulberry contains a diverse array of bioactive compounds, including tannins, steroids, alkaloids, flavonoids, anthocyanins, phenolic acids, and stilbenoids, which are responsible for its wide-ranging pharmacological properties [ 44 46 47 48 4 Modern scientific investigations corroborate the traditional medicinal uses of white mulberry and further highlight its potential in treating various health conditions. The plant has demonstrated antimicrobial, anticancer, cardioprotective, and immunomodulatory effects [ 29 49 50 46 47 Quantitative profiling of white mulberry leaves revealed high levels of DNJ, ranging from 0.11 to 0.36 mg/g DW, responsible for its α-glucosidase inhibitory activity [ 30 29 38 22 Figure 1 3.4. Rhazya stricta Rhazya, or harmal-e-shami, is a perennial shrub. In some regions, it is also referred to as Desert Milkweed or Aqeeq (in Arabic-speaking areas). It is a medicinal plant widely found in arid regions, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia. It is native to the UAE [ 51 52 23 30 51 Phytochemical studies have identified glycosides, alkaloids, tannins, and triterpenes as the primary active compounds in harmal-e-shami leaf extracts. These compounds exhibit promising pharmacological activities, including antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [ 52 53 53 Modern scientific investigations continue to corroborate the traditional medicinal uses of harmal-e-shami. A study evaluated its antidiabetic potential through phytochemical profiling of root extracts, revealing its efficacy in lowering blood glucose levels [ 30 Table 1 Quantitative assessments show that harmal-e-shami leaf extracts contain alkaloids at concentrations up to 3.8% dry weight, including compounds such as rhazinilam and rhazimine [ 54 55 30 56 Figure 1 Table 1 Figure 1 Representative illustrations of the four medicinal plants native to the UAE: caper, bitter apple, white mulberry, and harmal-e-shami. biology-14-01146-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Medicinal plants in the UAE: phytochemical profiles, traditional uses, and pharmacological potential of caper, bitter apple, white mulberry, and harmal-e-shami.

Overview of Antidiabetic Properties of Medicinal Plants in the UAE 4.1. Capparis spinosa Caper is a plant recognized for its diverse phytochemical composition and has been extensively studied for its therapeutic potential, particularly in the management of diabetes. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of its bioactive compounds suggests that specific hydroxyl group configurations play a critical role in their antidiabetic effects. Notably, quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol contain a hydroxyl group at position 4′, while quercetin, isorhamnetin, and myricetin possess an additional hydroxyl group at position 3′. These structural features are considered essential for their biological efficacy in regulating glucose and managing diabetes [ 24 In vivo studies have substantiated the antidiabetic potential of caper. A study demonstrated that administering 20 mg/kg of aqueous fruit extract significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [ 61 11 62 The therapeutic potential of caper in managing T2DM has been increasingly supported by both preclinical and clinical evidence. In a well-characterized animal model of T2DM induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin, oral administration of caper fruit extract at doses of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg for 28 days significantly improved glucose tolerance and reduced fasting blood glucose levels. These effects were accompanied by enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and preservation of pancreatic histological architecture. Notably, the antidiabetic efficacy observed was comparable to that of metformin administered at 50 mg/kg, suggesting a mechanistic overlap involving oxidative stress modulation and β-cell protection [ 18 Clinical findings corroborate the preclinical data. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, daily supplementation with 400 mg of caper fruit extract for eight weeks in patients with T2DM resulted in statistically significant reductions in both fasting blood glucose ( p p 57 Further supporting its metabolic benefits, another randomized controlled study demonstrated that caper oxymel, a traditional preparation, effectively slowed the progression of hyperglycemia and contributed to a significant reduction in body mass index among diabetic individuals [ 1 Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of caper as a safe and effective natural adjunct for glycemic control and metabolic regulation in T2DM. However, larger-scale and longer-term clinical trials are warranted to validate these outcomes and to explore the underlying mechanisms in human subjects. In summary, caper exhibits strong antidiabetic potential supported by both preclinical and clinical evidence. Its effects are primarily mediated by flavonoids that enhance insulin sensitivity, reduce blood glucose, and protect against oxidative stress, making it a promising candidate for future therapeutic applications. 4.2. Citrullus colocynthis Bitter apple contains a diverse array of bioactive compounds that contribute to its therapeutic potential, particularly in diabetes management. Studies systematically reported the presence of cucurbitacins (triterpenoids and their glycosides) in this species, including cucurbitacins A–L and cucurbitacin E 2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside [ 38 63 64 21 37 65 20 21 66 21 67 42 68 69 70 71 72 73 43 74 75 21 Bitter apple exhibits potent glucose-lowering and β-cell protective effects attributed to its content of cucurbitacins, alkaloids, and flavonoids. A study demonstrated that aqueous and ethanolic extracts of bitter apple seeds significantly reduced blood glucose levels and improved insulin responsiveness in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [ 67 66 43 In conclusion, bitter apple has demonstrated effective glucose-lowering, β-cell regenerative, and anti-inflammatory properties. Its bioactive compounds, particularly cucurbitacins and alkaloids, contribute to its potential role in diabetes management, though dosage safety remains a key consideration. 4.3. Morus alba White mulberry is widely recognized for its diverse phytochemical profile, comprising bioactive compounds with significant pharmacological properties, particularly in the management of diabetes and related metabolic disorders. Among its key bioactive constituents, chlorogenic acid, a phenolic compound from the hydroxycinnamic family, is known for its antioxidant and antidiabetic properties [ 29 76 29 77 29 Flavonoids such as rutin and quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucoside (Q3G) further enhance the antidiabetic potential of white mulberry due to their dual antidiabetic and anti-obesity effects. These flavonoids regulate glucose uptake by activating the Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways while modulating lipid accumulation in adipocytes [ 45 78 29 76 Extensive research has identified multiple mechanisms through which white mulberry exerts its antidiabetic effects. Early investigations recognized DNJ and phenolic acids, including chlorogenic acid, as primary contributors to its hypoglycemic activity [ 58 50 45 Recent clinical studies have reinforced these findings. A systematic review concluded that white mulberry significantly reduces postprandial glucose and insulin levels, although further rigorous trials are necessary to confirm its long-term efficacy [ 22 59 79 Moreover, Sangzhi alkaloids (SZ-A), derived from white mulberry twigs, have been shown to promote insulin secretion, protect β-cell function, and prevent β-cell dedifferentiation and apoptosis, making them a promising target for diabetes treatment [ 80 White mulberry is recognized for its hypoglycemic effects, mainly due to bioactive compounds such as DNJ, chlorogenic acid, and rutin. A systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that white mulberry leaf extract significantly reduces postprandial glucose and insulin levels, with additional benefits on lipid profiles and oxidative stress markers in clinical studies [ 22 58 Overall, white mulberry exhibits a well-documented antidiabetic profile through mechanisms such as α-glucosidase inhibition, insulin sensitization, and reduction of oxidative stress. Its clinical efficacy and favorable safety data support its use as a functional food or complementary therapy. 4.4. Rhazya stricta Harmal-e-shami has been extensively investigated for its potential role in diabetes management, with studies yielding variable outcomes regarding its effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin regulation in animal models. Some research indicates that harmal-e-shami extracts do not produce significant changes in glucose concentrations or other measures of glucose homeostasis in diabetic rats [ 30 51 51 60 The hypoglycemic activity of harmal-e-shami is further substantiated by its ability to inhibit key enzymes involved in hyperglycemia, including dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and β-secretase. Additionally, harmal-e-shami has been shown to enhance glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, a critical regulator of glucose metabolism [ 30 51 51 54 Among the different extract fractions, the ethyl acetate fraction (EF) of harmal-e-shami has demonstrated auspicious glucose-lowering effects, exhibiting efficacy comparable to that of standard antidiabetic drugs [ 51 30 81 These findings collectively reinforce the antidiabetic potential of harmal-e-shami as a natural therapeutic agent. Its ability to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism, combined with its enzyme-inhibitory and hormone-regulating properties, underscores its promise for further exploration in diabetes treatment. Future research should focus on the isolation and purification of active compounds, as well as their clinical evaluation, to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of harmal-e-shami in diabetes management. Harmal-e-shami exhibits antidiabetic effects through enzyme inhibition and hormonal regulation. A study on root extract fractions showed DPP-IV inhibition of up to 61%, β-secretase inhibition of up to 83%, and elevated GLP-1 secretion, which led to significantly reduced glucose and HbA1c levels in diabetic mice [ 30 60 52 In summary, harmal-e-shami shows multifaceted antidiabetic activity, including DPP-IV inhibition, GLP-1 enhancement, and adiponectin modulation. While findings are promising, further standardized and clinical studies are needed to validate its therapeutic applications ( Table 2 5. Additional Pharmacological Activities of the Reviewed Medicinal Plants 5.1. Capparis spinosa Beyond its antidiabetic effects, caper has demonstrated notable anticancer activity, particularly through flavonoids like rutin and kaempferol, which induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in vitro [ 25 82 83 20 83 84 85 S. aureus E. coli 19 86 20 5.2. Citrullus colocynthis Bitter apple possesses potent anticancer activity, especially through cucurbitacin E, which induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells at concentrations of 5–20 µg/mL [ 21 40 87 88 89 32 37 89 S. aureus P. aeruginosa Bacillus subtilis 34 37 87 88 Candida krusei C. albicans C. parapsilosis C. glabrata Aspergillus flavus 90 91 92 5.3. Morus alba White mulberry exhibits strong anticancer potential, primarily due to flavonoids like morusin and stilbenoids, which inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in prostate, liver, and breast cancer models [ 46 93 94 45 94 95 96 H. pylori Candida albicans 47 46 93 97 93 95 5.4. Rhazya stricta Harmal-e-shami contains numerous indole alkaloids with established cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines, including HeLa and HL-60, with IC 50 30 53 98 99 100 101 Klebsiella pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus 52 51 6. Conclusions and Future Perspectives This review consolidates current evidence on the antidiabetic properties of four medicinal plants commonly used in the UAE: caper, bitter apple, white mulberry, and harmal-e-shami. These plants contain a diverse range of bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, cucurbitacins, and polyphenols, that act through various mechanisms, such as α-glucosidase inhibition, insulin sensitization, antioxidant activity, and modulation of metabolic pathways. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that caper and white mulberry are particularly promising due to their consistent hypoglycemic effects and favorable safety profiles. bitter apple and harmal-e-shami also show significant potential, although further studies are needed to address variability in efficacy, standardization, and potential toxicity. Despite the therapeutic potential of these plants, several challenges remain. These include the lack of standardized extracts, a scarcity of large-scale clinical trials, and gaps in understanding their long-term safety and efficacy. Future research should focus on isolating active compounds, clinically validating herbal formulations, and exploring their synergistic effects with conventional antidiabetic drugs. Preserving and scientifically validating the UAE’s native medicinal flora represents a significant opportunity for developing culturally relevant, plant-based interventions for chronic diseases, such as diabetes. With continued investment in research, these plants may make substantial contributions to sustainable healthcare solutions and the discovery of natural product-based drugs.
