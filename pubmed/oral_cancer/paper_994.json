This process proceeds through two distinct stages: a priming phase, characterized by transcriptional activation, and a triggering phase, in which inflammasomes, cytosolic multiprotein complexes, are activated to initiate inflammatory signaling cascades. Canonical inflammasomes, the first to be identified, have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse inflammatory disorders. In contrast, noncanonical inflammasomes have only recently been characterized, and their precise contributions to immune regulation and disease development remain incompletely defined. Diabetes mellitus (DM), simply diabetes, represents a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders marked by chronic hyperglycemia and is associated with a broad spectrum of complications. The involvement of canonical inflammasomes in DM and its complications has been well demonstrated. More recently, however, accumulating evidence has uncovered crucial roles for noncanonical inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of DM and related complications This review comprehensively discusses current advances in understanding the regulatory functions of murine caspase-11 and human caspase-4/5 noncanonical inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of DM and diabetes-associated complications, highlighting their potential as novel therapeutic targets. caspase-4 caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome diabetes diabetes-associated complications Kyonggi University Research Grant 2025 This work was supported by Kyonggi University Research Grant 2025. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction An inflammasome is a cytosolic multiprotein complex that serves as a key platform for inducing inflammatory signaling cascades [ 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly known as diabetes, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the two most prevalent forms of the disease. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages the pancreas, resulting in a lack of insulin production. Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in causing this autoimmune response [ 3 3 3 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2. Noncanonical Inflammasomes 2.1. PRRs PRRs are crucial components of inflammasomes, serving as sensors that detect PAMPs and DAMPs. Canonical inflammasome PRRs recognize PAMPs and DAMPs and subsequently assemble canonical inflammasomes by engaging caspase-1, either directly or via the adaptor protein ASC [ 1 2 1 2 Figure 1 Figure 1 2.2. Ligands Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an endotoxin derived from Gram-negative bacteria and was identified as the main PAMP detected by noncanonical inflammasomes [ 25 26 1 2 27 27 Recent studies have demonstrated that additional molecules also can act as PAMPs for noncanonical inflammasome activation. The oxidized phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (oxPAPC) has been shown to directly bind to caspase-11, initiating the caspase-11-dependent noncanonical inflammasome pathway in dendritic cells [ 28 28 The glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) found on the surface of Leishmania 29 29 Secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps), key virulence factors of Candida albicans 30 30 2.3. Activation and Signaling Pathways As mentioned earlier, LPS is taken up through receptor-mediated endocytosis and becomes enclosed within endosomes, from which it must be released into the cytosol for sensing by caspase-4/5/11. Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), a family of IFN-inducible GTPases, attach to endosomes, causing the loss of membrane integrity and membrane disruption, which eventually allows LPS to escape into the cytosol, where it can interact with caspase-4/5/11 [ 1 2 Once LPS is released from endosomes, caspase-4/5/11 sense cytosolic LPS by direct binding between their CARDs and the lipid A moiety of LPS, and this interaction results in the formation of LPS-caspase-4/5/11 complexes, which subsequently oligomerize via CARD–CARD interactions to assemble caspase-4/5/11 noncanonical inflammasomes ( Figure 1 1 2 31 32 31 32 The activation of noncanonical inflammasomes subsequently initiate the signal transduction cascades of inflammatory responses. Upon the activation of noncanonical inflammasomes, GSDMD is proteolytically cleaved at 276 aspartic acid residue, generating two different GSDMD fragments, N-terminal (N-GSDMD) and C-terminal GSDMD (C-GSDMD) [ 1 2 1 2 + 1 2 1 2 Figure 2 3. Roles of Noncanonical Inflammasomes in Diabetes and Its Complications 3.1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by high blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and a relative deficiency in insulin. It represents approximately 90% of all diabetes cases [ 33 33 Recent studies have highlighted the role of noncanonical inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Fender et al. investigated the involvement of caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome in the context of diabetic heart disease associated with T2DM in mice [ 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 Wang et al. demonstrated the relationship with and effect of oral microbiota on caspase-11 noncanonical inflammatory pathway in patients with T2DM [ 35 35 35 An observational cross-sectional study by Arunachalam et al. investigated the involvement of the caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis pathway in the gingival tissue of individuals with T2DM [ 36 36 In summary, these studies highlight the regulatory functions of murine caspase-11 and human caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasomes in the development of T2DM. However, their expression and activity varied across different tissues affected by T2DM, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms. The regulatory function of the caspase-4/11 noncanonical inflammasomes in T2DM pathogenesis is described in Figure 3 3.2. Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) Diabetic nephropathy (DN), also known as diabetic kidney disease (DKD), is a severe chronic complication of diabetes characterized by damage to the kidneys’ filtration system due to prolonged high blood glucose levels. This damage can progressively impair kidney function and may eventually lead to kidney failure [ 37 37 Studies have recently demonstrated the critical involvement of noncanonical inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of DN. Chen et al. explored how gut microbiota-derived OMVs regulate tubulointerstitial inflammation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DN rats and HK-2 human renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) [ 38 38 38 Ito et al. reported that the caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome is involved in renal injury in diabetic BTBR ob/ob mice [ 39 39 Shao et al. investigated the involvement of the murine caspase-4/11 noncanonical inflammasome and GSDMD-driven pyroptosis in glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) and in a mouse model of DN induced by STZ [ 40 40 40 Cheng et al. demonstrated the regulatory role of caspase-4/11 noncanonical inflammasomes and GSDMD-driven pyroptosis in the renal injury in podocytes and a mouse model of DN induced by HFD and STZ [ 41 41 41 41 In summary, these findings emphasize the functional involvement of caspase-4/11 noncanonical inflammasomes in the development and progression of DN. Nonetheless, their specific contributions and underlying mechanisms in renal injury during DN pathogenesis remain largely unclear, strongly demanding the need for further research to elucidate their regulatory functions in different renal cell types during DN pathogenesis along with the associated molecular pathways. The involvement of caspase-4/11 noncanonical inflammasomes in DN pathogenesis is illustrated in Figure 4 3.3. Diabetic Periodontitis (DP) Diabetic periodontitis (DP) is a severe form of gum disease that occurs more commonly and with greater severity in people with diabetes. Individuals with advanced periodontitis have a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes compared to those with healthy gums [ 42 43 Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal roles of noncanonical inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of DP. Li et al. investigated examined the therapeutic effects of a tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA)-loaded metformin complex (TMC) on DP pathogenesis by modulating caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome in macrophages and a DP mouse model induced by HFD and ligature [ 44 44 44 Arunachalam et al. reported an observational cross-sectional study to investigate the role of pyroptosis triggered by caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasome activation in the gingival tissues of patients with DP and T2DM [ 36 36 36 In summary, these findings provide critical evidence that caspase-4/11 noncanonical inflammasomes are associated with DP by promoting pyroptosis and inflammatory responses. However, their regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated DP, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood, highlighting the demand for further studies to elucidate their regulatory roles and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated DP. The regulatory functions of caspase-4/11 noncanonical inflammasomes in diabetes-associated DP pathogenesis are depicted in Figure 5 3.4. Other Diabetes-Associated Complications Enteric neuronal degeneration describes the progressive damage and loss of enteric neurons, the nerve cells within the enteric nervous system [ 45 46 45 46 47 48 49 A recent study demonstrated the regulatory function of the noncanonical inflammasome in DEN pathogenesis. Ye et al. showed that caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis contributes to DEN pathogenesis in mice with Western diet (WD)-induced enteric nitrergic neuronal degeneration [ 50 50 50 50 50 In diabetes, particularly when kidney function is impaired, excess fluid can accumulate in the body, resulting in hypervolemia [ 51 51 52 53 52 53 A study highlighted the regulatory involvement of the noncanonical inflammasome in diabetic HD (DHD) pathogenesis. In a cross-sectional analysis, Ulrich et al. examined the involvement of the caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasome in inflammatory responses among DHD patients and found that the activity of caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasome was significantly elevated in DHD patient serum [ 54 1 2 54 In summary, these findings suggest that noncanonical inflammasomes contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated complications, such as DEN and DHD. However, the molecular mechanisms of caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome-triggered pyroptosis in enteric neuronal pyroptosis in obese subjects or diabetes patients are still largely unknown. Furthermore, only increased expression of caspase-4 was observed in DHD pathogenesis, which requires demonstrating the regulatory functions of caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasome along with the underlying mechanisms during the pathogenesis of DHD. The regulatory functions of noncanonical inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of DEN and DHD are illustrated in Figure 6 4. Conclusions and Perspectives This study provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances delineating the regulatory functions of murine caspase-11 and human caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications, including T2DM, DN, DP, DHD, and DEN. Emerging evidence from relevant animal models and diverse disease-associated cellular models, as summarized in Table 1 Although noncanonical inflammasomes have emerged as regulators in diabetes and its complications, canonical inflammasomes, particularly NLRP3, remain better established as central mediators through their broad regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways across diverse cell types [ 55 56 57 58 22 24 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 Despite substantial evidence supporting the regulatory roles of noncanonical inflammasomes in diabetes and its complications, most studies discussed in this review have primarily focused on murine caspase-11 using mouse and cell models. Although murine caspase-11 is the functional ortholog of human caspase-4/5, they may differ in the following aspects. 1) Murine possesses only a single caspase-11, whereas humans have both caspase-4 and caspase-5, which may differ in their expression patterns (normal vs. pathological conditions), activation requirements, and relative contributions to disease pathogenesis. Human data are often caspase-4-focused, with the role of caspase-5 being less well defined. Therefore, direct generalization of murine caspase-11 findings to human caspase-4/5 as a whole may have the risk of either underestimating or overestimating their relevance. 2) The structural chemistry of LPS lipid A may be different between murine caspase-11 and human caspase-4/5. Caspase-4 can recognize certain under-acylated forms of lipid A (e.g., those from Francisella 67 68 69 70 71 + 1 2 72 In conclusion, murine caspase-11 and human caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasomes are pivotal contributors to the pathogenesis of diabetes and diabetes-associated complications, primarily by promoting tissue damage through GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and inflammatory responses at disease sites via functional interactions with other cellular molecules. Defining the regulatory functions and the underlying molecular mechanistic pathways of noncanonical inflammasomes in association with diabetes and its complications will be critical for the development of targeted therapies and the advancement of translational studies in the patients suffering from diabetes and diabetes-associated complications.

Caspase-4/5/11 noncanonical inflammasomes undergo autoproteolytic cleavage to generate their active forms, which subsequently process GSDMD. The cleavage of GSDMD results in pore formation within the plasma membrane, thereby driving pyroptotic cell death. In parallel, active caspase-4/5/11 noncanonical inflammasomes engage the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to proteolytic activation of caspase-1. Activated caspase-1, in turn, mediates the proteolytic maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, which are released through GSDMD pores. Figure 3 Regulatory roles of noncanonical inflammasomes in T2DM. In HFD-induced diabetic mice, ventricular tissues exhibit enhanced caspase-11 autoproteolysis accompanied by elevated caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome–dependent inflammatory responses and pyroptosis. In patients with T2DM, serum levels of caspase-4, LPS, and IL-1β are markedly increased. Consistently, gingival tissues from T2DM patients show upregulated expression of caspase-4 and GSDMD, together with caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasome-activated inflammatory responses. Figure 4 Regulatory roles of noncanonical inflammasomes in DN. In STZ- or HFD/STZ-induced models of DN in mice and rats, renal tissues show caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome activation, accompanied by caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome-mediated inflammatory responses and pyroptotic injury. Similarly, caspase-11 expression is elevated in the kidneys of diabetic BTBR ob/ob mice. Caspase-4 and caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasomes are activated in fBEV-stimulated human TECs, as well as in HG-stimulated mouse and human GECs and podocytes, leading to inflammatory responses, GSDMD processing, and pyroptosis. Figure 5 Regulatory roles of noncanonical inflammasomes in DP. In HG-stimulated mouse RAW264.7 macrophages, activation of the caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome drives inflammatory responses and pyroptosis. In an HFD/ligature-induced mouse model of DP, caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome is activated, promoting osteoclastogenesis and alveolar bone resorption. Gingival tissues from patients with T2DM and DP show elevated expression of caspase-4 and GSDMD, with their expression levels positively correlating with both periodontal disease severity and diabetic clinical parameters. Figure 6 Regulatory roles of noncanonical inflammasomes in DEN and DHD. In overweight and obese patients, nitrergic enteric neurons exhibit increased susceptibility to pyroptotic cell death. In a WD-induced mouse model of DEN, activation of the caspase-11 noncanonical inflammasome drives pyroptosis of myenteric neurons, resulting in impaired colonic motility. Caspase-4 noncanonical inflammasome activity is elevated in the serum of DHD patients. ijms-26-08893-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Regulatory roles of noncanonical inflammasomes in diabetes and diabetes-associated complications.
