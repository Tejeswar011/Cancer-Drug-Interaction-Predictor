This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/404355-glomangioma-of-the-renal-artery-a-rare-case-of-a-glomus-tumor Glomus tumors are rare mesenchymal neoplasms originating from the glomus bodies of the skin. When found in the kidney, these tumors are uncommon, with very few documented cases in the medical literature. Our comprehensive review identified only a very limited number of reported primary renal glomus tumors. Although the majority of these tumors are benign, two cases have been reported as malignant and one as having indeterminate malignant potential. We describe a rare case: a 69-year-old male patient with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer and possible local recurrence in the anatomical region of the proximal left renal artery, identified as a new finding during scheduled follow-up examinations. The same evaluation also revealed an asymptomatic left hydronephrosis with impaired renal parenchymal function, attributed to previous therapeutic interventions. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of glomangioma, a type of glomus tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the 23rd documented case of a primary benign renal glomus tumor, and based on the existing literature, there are no other case reports describing this tumor arising from the renal artery. Given that primary renal glomus tumors are rare and can mimic other mesenchymal kidney neoplasms on imaging, thorough evaluation of any kidney tumor is crucial. This should include detailed histopathological and immunohistochemical studies, as accurate diagnosis is vital for patient management, since these tumors typically follow a benign course after surgical removal. core biopsy glomagioma glomus body glomus tumor percutaneous ct-guided biopsy renal artery pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction An unusual benign neoplasm arising from the neuro-arterial plexus is known as a glomus tumor. The glomus body is a specialized arteriovenous anastomosis that operates without an intervening capillary network, functioning primarily in temperature regulation. Although glomus tumors are infrequent, representing under 2% of all soft tissue tumors [ 1 1 5 Extra-digital glomus tumors are exceptionally rare, as glomus bodies are typically absent from visceral organs [ 1 4 5 1 6 The present case report describes the 23rd reported case of a glomus tumor of the kidney [ 1 6 7 9 Case presentation An unusual benign neoplasm arising from the neuro-arterial plexus. A 69-year-old male patient, who had previously undergone surgery and chemotherapy for transitional cell urinary cancer, presented for a scheduled 18-month follow-up. Abdominal CT and PET-CT scans (Figures 1a 1d 2a 2b Figure 1 (a) Relatively well-defined lesion at the proximal left renal artery (arrow) in axial view (portal-venous phase) and (b) in coronal view (portal-venous phase). (c) Arterial phase showing the same relatively well-defined, heterogeneously enhancing lesion at the proximal left renal artery (arrow) in axial view. Note the lesion’s close proximity to the left renal artery (arrowhead). (d) PET-CT image of the same lesion at the left renal artery (arrow), measuring 2.2 × 1.8 cm with an SUVmax of 2.8.

Note the needle’s access path (arrow) and the tip of the core needle within the lesion (circle in 2a and arrowhead in 2b), verified just before sampling. In total, two filamentous tissue fragments of brownish-hemorrhagic color and fibroelastic consistency, measuring 1.7 cm and 1.5 cm in length, were obtained and sent for histological examination. The examined specimen was reported to be a generally benign pericytic (perivascular) kidney lesion, consisting histologically of three components: glomus cells, which were small and uniform with well-defined cell borders (H&E stain, Figure 3 4 5 Figure 3 Glomus cells, small and uniform with well-defined cell borders (red circle). Figure 4 Thin-walled, capillary-sized vessels without atypia (red circle). Figure 5 Smooth, elongated muscle cells without atypia (red circle). The above histomorphological findings were suggestive of glomangioma/glomus tumor of the kidney. The decision not to proceed with surgical resection was made after an MDT meeting that included a medical oncologist, a surgical oncologist, and a radiologist. The primary therapeutic focus remained on managing the patient’s malignant transitional cell carcinoma rather than the benign glomangioma. Given the patient’s poor overall clinical status at the time, the MDT reached a consensus to prioritize palliative chemotherapy. Surgical intervention remained a potential option, contingent on significant improvement in the patient’s general condition and a favorable response to chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the patient’s clinical decline precluded further consideration of resection. He continued chemotherapy and passed away approximately six months later due to complications of the malignant disease. Discussion Glomus bodies, which are specialized arteriovenous physiological structures, have a dense nerve supply. The first description of a glomus tumor was made by Masson in 1924. These tumors are perivascular mesenchymal neoplasms composed of cells that closely resemble the modified smooth muscle cells of normal glomus bodies. Glomus tumors are found in both sexes with nearly equal frequency, though they are slightly more common in females, particularly in subungual locations. They are most often seen in young adults between 20 and 40 years old. Typically, they present as small, reddish-blue nodules on the extremities, especially under the nails, and are accompanied by pain [ 5 7 8 9 2 6 8 It is notable that approximately 25% of these tumors develop in internal organs, which typically do not contain glomus bodies. This can make diagnosis challenging. The exact process by which glomus tumors form in these internal organs is not well understood, as most originate from soft tissues with normal glomus structures. A small number of primary glomus tumors have been reported in the medical literature in locations such as the female reproductive system, digestive system, bones, lungs, mediastinum, larynx, trachea, oral cavity, pancreas, liver, and sinonasal area [ 1 2 7 1 2 6 Typically, glomus tumors are found in the renal parenchyma, the functional tissue of the kidney. However, there have been rare instances of glomus tumors arising in unusual locations [ 1 6 7 9 The range of possible differential diagnoses includes solitary fibrous tumor, myopericytoma, paraganglioma, angiomyolipoma, renal hemangioma, juxtaglomerular cell tumor, carcinoid tumor, and lymphoma. Other considerations include Ewing sarcoma, leiomyoma, and renal cell carcinoma [ 7 9 Percutaneous image-guided biopsy is the only indicated procedure for the diagnosis of such lesions situated deep within the retroperitoneal space. Notably, CT-guided fine-needle biopsy (FNB) was technically demanding and carried a high risk of bleeding due to the lesion’s proximity to the renal artery (Figure 1c Based on existing literature, this represents the first histologically proven case of a primary renal glomus tumor arising from the renal artery. Radiologically, these tumors can mimic other mesenchymal neoplasms of the kidney, posing a diagnostic challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the histological and immunohistochemical similarities between glomus tumors and other renal tumors, which can lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, a thorough investigation, including advanced imaging, image-guided biopsy, and detailed histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of any incidentally found renal tumors, is crucial for accurate identification, as glomus tumors typically follow a benign clinical course after resection. Conclusions The occurrence of primary renal glomus tumors, of which we present the 23rd case (renal glomangioma), is infrequent and, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case arising from the renal artery. Radiologically, these tumors can mimic other mesenchymal neoplasms of the kidney, posing a diagnostic challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the histological and immunohistochemical similarities between glomus tumors and other renal tumors, which can lead to misdiagnosis. Consequently, a thorough evaluation of any incidentally detected kidney tumor is essential for accurate identification of a glomus tumor. This evaluation should include advanced imaging and, most importantly, image-guided biopsy followed by detailed histopathological and immunohistochemical studies. Such an approach is crucial, as glomus tumors usually follow a benign course after surgical removal. Our case highlights the critical importance of interventional radiology in securing a definitive diagnosis for these rare and complex renal masses.
