Surgical treatments are often ineffective in this subset of the population. We sought to investigate the role of tongue fat in the normal and overweight populations. In this prospective cohort study, patients underwent overnight polysomnography and MRI using a Dixon sequence. Volumetric reconstruction evaluated the size and distribution of tongue fat deposits in subjects with and without sleep apnea. The study included 86 patients; mean age of 42.2 (SD 11.2) years, 16% female.

Study design and methods This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines provided by the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) Institutional Review Board (IRB). The study protocol was approved by the IRB (#2018-BOT). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their inclusion in the study. In this prospective cohort study, patients were recruited immediately after undergoing an overnight type 1, fully attended, seven channel in lab polysomnography at an American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) accredited lab at a single institution over a 24-month period, in compliance with the approved institutional IRB protocol. The investigators were blinded to whether the patients had OSA. Recruited subjects meeting inclusion criteria then underwent MRI of the face utilizing a two-point Dixon sequence to separate water from fat signal. All MRIs were performed on a 3.0-T scanner within one week of PSG, prior to final interpretation of the patients’ PSG. Image analysis with Amira Software 2020.3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was performed by a neuroradiologist with 15 years of experience in head and neck imaging, who was blinded to patient BMI and PSG results. Eligible participants included adults ≥ 18 year of age eligible for care at military treatment facility undergoing a PSG for evaluation of sleep apnea who could obtain an MRI. We excluded those with a history of head and/or neck radiation, history of tongue surgery, history of oropharyngeal cancer, current pregnancy, or those with a relative or absolute contraindication to undergoing MRI. None of the enrolled participants had a history of stroke resulting in tongue paralysis. One subject was excluded due to dental braces and severe metallic susceptibility artifact obscuring tongue visualization on face MRI. The study size was determined to be adequate via comparative results by reproducing known, significant associations at the end of the study period. Demographics including age and sex were collected by chart review. Height and weight were measured at the time of PSG, and BMI was calculated from these measurements. BMI was classified according to Adult BMI CDC guidelines, with obesity subdivided into Class 1 (BMI of 30 to < 35 kg/m 2 2 2 14 1 Multiple logistic regression testing including Fisher Exact and Wilcox rank sum tests were performed to assess for associations among demographics, BMI, AHI, tongue volume, tongue fat volume, and tongue fat fraction. Volumetric analyses of patients with OSA were compared to their matched controls without. Results are reported in accordance with STROBE guidelines. Results A total of 86 patients met inclusion criteria, with all patients completing both a PSG and MRI.

Values generated by volumetric analyses are unitless. Measured variables from PSG data included AHI, from which classification of OSA was determined. Measured variables from Amira image analysis of the face MRIs included tongue volume (mL), mean tongue signal (unitless), mean adipose signal (unitless), tongue fat fraction (%), and tongue fat volume (mL). The median AHI was 7.4 events per hour (IQR, 12.9), with 41.9% ( n Fisher Exact testing was performed to assess for significant associations of gender and BMI category with OSA, with no significant associations found. Wilcox rank sum test was performed to assess for significant associations of demographic and measured variables with OSA.

Example screenshot of Amira image analysis software to segment the tongue and to measure total tongue volume (mL) on the in-phase T2-weighted images with multiplanar reformats. Mean signal in the tongue volume on the fat-only images (not shown) was divided by mean signal in parapharyngeal adipose tissue to yield an estimate of tongue fat fraction (%), which was then multiplied by total tongue volume to yield an estimate of tongue fat volume (mL) for each subject.

Regression lines for tongue fat fraction ( A B P Discussion Our study suggests that excess tongue fat does not appear to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of OSA in the non-obese or overweight (BMI < 30 kg/m 2 n In contrast to previous studies of tongue fat and its relationship to obstructive sleep apnea, our study is unique in that it assesses this relationship in a lower BMI population. No patients in our cohort had a BMI ≥ 35. In fact, only about 20% of our study population was obese compared to roughly 40% of the US adult population. This likely reflects the well described phenomenon of a lower prevalence of obesity in military communities compared to the general population 15 2 16 4 17 4 In the obese population, the role of tongue fat as a contributor to OSA is well described. This may help to explain why obese and morbidly obese patients are difficult to treat, as the most commonly used current therapies do not target tongue fat 18 19 20 21 22 11 23 24 13 25 26 27 Conclusions Tongue fat does not play a significant role in the pathophysiology of OSA in the non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m 2 2 Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
