Immune dysregulation can result in sustained activation of the immune system, leading to systemic chronic inflammation. This condition significantly disrupts immune homeostasis and is intimately associated with the onset of numerous chronic systemic diseases. Currently, the treatment of diseases related to immune dysregulation confronts several challenges, most notably the substantial side effects and inconsistent efficacy of long-term immunosuppressive drug use. Consequently, developing immunomodulatory strategies that balance efficacy and safety has emerged as a prominent research focus. Plant-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (PVLNs), natural nanomaterials secreted by plant cells, exhibit significant potential in immunomodulation owing to their excellent biocompatibility, minimal immunogenicity, and cross-species communication capabilities. This paper reviews the biogenesis, composition, and properties of PVLNs, emphasizing the mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunomodulation they mediate and their applications in diseases characterized by immune disorders. It also analyzes the challenges related to target delivery, stability optimization, drug loading, and storage encountered in their engineering. In the future, as the mechanisms of PVLNs are more deeply understood and nanotechnology continues to advance, their potential in precision immunotherapy and clinical translation is anticipated to be further augmented.

It is responsible not only for recognizing and eliminating foreign pathogens but also for regulating bodily homeostasis. However, under certain conditions, the immune response may become aberrant, leading to immune dysregulation. This can result in immune imbalance and chronic inflammation, subsequently causing a range of chronic diseases [ 1 2 3 4 5 In recent years, the advancement of nanotechnology has directed scholarly attention to Plant-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (PVLNs), a class of Membrane-bound nanostructures isolated from plant sources, exhibiting lipid bilayer architectures and bioactive cargo. PVLNs are small membranous structures secreted by plant cells, characterized by distinct physicochemical properties and biological functions. Typically, they contain lipid bilayers loaded with various active molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and other metabolites, enabling them to transmit information within plants and across species. Compared to synthetic nanoparticles, PVLNs offer higher biocompatibility and lower toxicity, making them an ideal platform for drug delivery. Furthermore, their accessibility and cost-effectiveness present promising opportunities for developing innovative therapeutic strategies [ 6 Importantly, an increasing number of studies demonstrate that PVLNs possess notable immunomodulatory properties. They can directly modulate host immune responses by affecting immune cell differentiation, phenotype, and function, and indirectly influence immune processes by modifying signaling pathways in the local microenvironment. For instance, certain PVLNs have been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory factor levels in the local microenvironment, effectively alleviating inflammatory responses. They also induce immune cells to adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype and promote tissue repair, thereby enhancing healing following immune dysregulation [ 7 Although some reviews have summarized the role of PVLNs in regulating the immune microenvironment and anti-inflammatory responses, there remains a relative paucity of reviews on their role in modulating immune cell function and intervening in systemic diseases induced by immune dysregulation. This paper aims to summarize recent advancements in PVLNs related to immune regulation. We will concentrate on the mechanisms by which PVLNs regulate intrinsic and adaptive immune cells and outline research progress on their immunomodulatory therapies in various systemic diseases. Additionally, we will discuss the prospects and challenges associated with developing plant-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles for engineered modifications and clinical applications. 2 Biogenesis and acquisition of PVLNs PVLNs are exosomal nanoparticles secreted by plants, primarily derived from edible sources such as ginger, soybeans, and grapes, with sizes typically ranging from 30 to 400 nm. Due to their stable structure and abundant availability, PVLNs exhibit significant potential as natural drug delivery systems and therapeutic carriers, progressively emerging as a focal point in nanomedicine and plant functionality research [ 8 2.1 Biogenesis of PVLNs PVLNs have emerged as a prominent area of nanomedicine research in recent years, with their biogenesis, composition, and application properties garnering significant attention. Currently, the biology of PVLNs is not completely characterised. Some studies suggest that PVLNs' generation pathways mainly include three types ( Fig. 1 9 10 11 12 [13] [14] [15] Fig. 1 Origin, composition, and biogenesis of PVLNs. PVLNs can be derived from various plants, and their components primarily include lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, and various plant-derived bioactive substances. There are roughly three pathways for PVLNs biogenesis: (1) MVB pathway: Early endosomes (ESE) are formed through encapsulation of extracellular components and membrane proteins via invagination of the plasma membrane. These endosomes mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release vesicles into the extracellular space. (2) EXPO pathway: MVBs are formed after material exchange with the Golgi apparatus, and upon maturation, they fuse with the plasma membrane to release vesicles. (3) Vacuolar pathway: MVB-derived vesicles fuse with vacuolar vesicles to form intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), which are then transported to the extracellular space through fusion with the plasma membrane. Fig. 1 2.2 Composition of PVLNs PVLNs exhibit considerable diversity in their composition, encompassing lipids, proteins, RNA, and other bioactive molecules characteristic of plants. These components contribute to the unique stability and functionality of PVLNs. For instance, the lipid bilayer structure of PVLNs not only enhances exosome stability but also resists degradation in complex environments [ 16 17 18 2.3 Application advantages of PVLNs PVLNs possess distinct application advantages compared to extracellular vesicles (EVs) from various sources ( Table 1 19 20 21 22 23 24 Table 1 Application characteristics of PVLNs, ADEVs, BEVs, and SLVNs. Table 1 Vesicles PVLNs MDEVs BOMVs SLVNs Sources/Materials Fruits, vegetables, cereals, teas, medicinal plants, etc. Blood, urine, saliva, milk, etc Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli Phospholipids, polymers, proteins, fatty acids, etc. Preparation Methods Methods: Differential centrifugation, density gradient centrifugation, ultrafiltration, immunoaffinity capture, and size exclusion chromatography Thin film hydration, reverse phase evaporation, solvent injection, microfluidics Features The presence of the cell wall complicates the preparation and purification processes, necessitating the combination of physical and chemical methods to effectively isolate high-purity vesicles. The separation is relatively straightforward, with ultracentrifugation and density gradient centrifugation being commonly used and the procedures well-standardized. The purification of bacterial vesicles may require additional steps to remove bacterial components, such as endotoxin, especially when vesicles are isolated from Gram-negative bacteria. Preparation methods are diverse, and the choice depends on factors such as the particle size of the desired liposome, encapsulation efficiency, and production scale.

High, natural origin, low immunogenicity Lower (unmodified), the presence of PAMP can cause an inflammatory response and tissue damage, and toxicity can be reduced by modifying genes responsible for LPS synthesis or by neutralising endotoxin. It can be adjusted to reduce toxicity by adjusting the composition or modification. References [ 6 [ [25] [26] [27] [ 28 29 [ 30 31 3 Mechanisms of PVLNs' effects on intrinsic immune cells The immune system comprises two main defense mechanisms: innate immunity and adaptive immunity, forming a dynamic network of immune responses through spatial-temporal synergies and molecular interactions. Innate immunity acts as the first line of host defense against infections, rapidly recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This process orchestrates the nonspecific defense by phagocytes (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages), natural killer cells (NK cells), and the complement system [ 32 33 3.1 Macrophages In homeostatic conditions, macrophages serve as the primary phagocytic cell population residing in tissues throughout the body. Upon pathogen invasion, macrophages are the first cells to encounter and respond, playing a crucial role in the immune system through the following functions: 1. Pathogen clearance: Recognition, internalization, and degradation of pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and fungi) through surface receptors. Additionally, macrophages kill pathogens by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NADPH oxidase and nitric oxide (NO) via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), while also secreting lysosomal enzymes and antimicrobial peptides. 2. Antigen Presentation: As vital antigen-presenting cells (APCs), macrophages present antigens to CD4 + Fig. 2 34 Fig. 2 The mechanisms of PVLNs regulating the macrophage phagocytosis, polarization, and antigen presentation capabilities. Fig. 2 3.1.1 Regulation of macrophage phagocytosis Macrophages primarily eliminate pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis, thereby contributing to tissue homeostasis. This multi-step process involves phagosome formation and lysosome fusion to ensure effective clearance, thus maintaining immune homeostasis and serving as a crucial component of the body's immune defense [ 35 Previous studies have demonstrated that plant-derived vesicle-like nanostructures (PVLNs) can enhance macrophage phagocytic function through modulation of the activation or inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In one study, exosome-like nanovesicles derived from Catharanthus roseus (CLDENs) were internalized by macrophages, resulting in a significant increase in TNF-α secretion, which activated the NF-κB pathway by inducing its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Activated NF-κB subsequently upregulates the expression of the transcription factor PU.1. PU.1-mediated gene reprogramming enhances macrophage phagocytic activity, as evidenced by a FITC-dextran uptake assay demonstrating a significant increase in macrophage phagocytic efficiency. These findings indicate that CLDENs can regulate macrophage phagocytic function via the TNF-α/NF-κB/PU.1 signaling axis [ 36 37 38 Although direct evidence regarding the regulation of macrophage phagocytic function by plant-derived vesicle-like nanostructures (PVLNs) remains limited, certain plant-derived bioactive compounds have been demonstrated to modulate phagocytic activity through extracellular receptor-mediated intracellular signaling pathways and by influencing cytokine secretion [ 39 40 41 42 43 Current research on macrophage phagocytic activity has primarily centered on the modulatory effects of plant extracts. In contrast, PVLNs exhibit greater therapeutic potential in disease applications compared to plant extracts, suggesting that future studies should prioritize exploring the role and mechanisms of PVLNs in regulating macrophage phagocytic behavior. 3.1.2 Regulation of macrophage antigen presentation function Antigen presentation by macrophages is a crucial step in activating the adaptive immune system. Macrophages capture antigens through various mechanisms such as phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis [ 44 45 Once internalized into macrophages, PVLNs can enhance their ability to present pathogen antigens by modulating some of the aforementioned antigen-presenting processes. This enhances the activation of specific T cells and improves the efficiency of anti-infection immunity. The regulatory mechanisms primarily include: (1) Regulation of MHC and co-stimulatory molecule expression on the surface of macrophages is a critical aspect of immune modulation. Studies have demonstrated that exosome-like nanovesicles derived from Catharanthus roseus (CLDENs) upregulate the expression of MHC class II molecules and co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., CD86) on the surface of macrophages via the TNF-α/NF-κB/PU.1 signaling axis, thereby enhancing antigen presentation. CLDENs induce TNF-α secretion, activate NF-κB phosphorylation, and promote its translocation into the nucleus, thereby transcriptionally upregulating the expression of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1. PU.1 promotes MHC II gene expression and co-stimulatory molecule synthesis, thereby amplifying antigen processing and T cell activation [ 36 46 47 48 49 + 50 3.1.3 Regulation of macrophage polarization Macrophages are highly plastic immune cells, with their polarization being a dynamic process influenced by intracellular signaling pathways, inflammatory mediators, metabolic states, and redox balance. Classical M1 polarization is typically activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli like bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), whereas M2 polarization relies on anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). Activation of intracellular signaling pathways, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the signal transducer and activator of the transcription (STAT) family, is crucial in this process. Furthermore, metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, along with redox state regulation, significantly influence macrophage polarization [ 51 PVLNs exhibit significant potential in regulating macrophage polarization due to their bioactive components and distinct immunomodulatory properties. The primary mechanisms through which PVLNs influence macrophage polarization include: (1) Direct regulation of inflammatory signaling pathways: PVLNs can modulate macrophage polarization by directly activating or inhibiting specific inflammatory signaling pathways. For example, ceramide lipids enriched in ginseng-derived vesicles have been shown to activate the MyD88 signaling pathway via the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway, thereby inducing M2-to-M1 macrophage transition [ 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 These findings suggest that PVLNs regulate macrophage polarization via multiple mechanisms, collectively underscoring their substantial potential in immune regulation and disease therapy. This bidirectional regulatory effect on macrophages is closely associated with the specific binding of PVLNs components to macrophage surface receptors, thereby activating corresponding anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. However, the precise effects of the molecular contents of various plant-derived vesicles on macrophage polarization remain unclear. Further characterization of the molecular components within these vesicles and their functions may help elucidate the mechanisms by which they influence macrophage activity, thereby identifying more precise targets for immunotherapy. 3.2 Dendritic cells DCs are pivotal antigen-presenting cells within the immune system, crucial for bridging innate and adaptive immunity, maintaining immune homeostasis, and modulating immune responses. The maturation and activation of DCs involve a complex, multilayered regulatory process primarily mediated by PRRs. These receptors detect exogenous and endogenous signals, activating signaling pathways including TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB, LR3/TRIF/IRF3, and NLRs/PAMPs/DAMPs/IL-1β. Mature dendritic cells (mDCs) exhibit significant phenotypic and functional changes, characterized by up-regulation of surface co-stimulatory molecules like CD80, CD86, and the migration-associated receptor CCR7. mDCs possess an enhanced capability to process and present antigens, secreting substantial quantities of cytokines like IL-12 and IFN-γ. These alterations drive the differentiation of Th1, Th2, or Treg cells, initiating and regulating adaptive immune responses through interactions with T cell immune synapses [ 59 By modulating their maturation and activation states, DCs can differentiate between pathogens, tumors, and self-antigens, thereby playing roles in either immune activation or inhibition. Studies have demonstrated that PVLNs from different sources can exert immunosuppressive or stimulatory effects in different diseases by regulating the number of activated DCs and their differentiation direction( Fig. 3 + 60 + 61 62 60 63 Fig. 3 The pathway mechanism of PVLNs regulating dendritic cell differentiation. Fig. 3 In immunotherapy, targeting the maturation and activation of dendritic cells can enhance the efficiency of anti-tumor immune responses and reduce side effects caused by excessive immune reactions. Currently, the use of biological factors or nanocarriers to modulate the maturation state of dendritic cells is a significant focus in vaccine development and anticancer therapies. The role of PVLNs in regulating dendritic cell maturation and activation presents a promising avenue for research, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms of action. 3.3 Other cells (NK cells, neutrophils) Neutrophils and Natural Killer (NK) cells are two crucial components of the innate immune system, playing vital roles in immune defense, inflammatory responses, and immunomodulation. Neutrophils contribute significantly to immunomodulation and resistance to pathogen invasion through various mechanisms. Neutrophils rapidly accumulate at the site of infection by recognizing Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and removing pathogens through phagocytosis. They subsequently kill the pathogens by producing ROS and releasing lysosomal enzymes [ 64 65 66 67 68 Natural Killer (NK) cells are another essential component of innate immunity and serve as the primary effector cells in non-specific immune responses. They can directly kill target cells by releasing perforins and granzymes, inducing apoptosis in virus-infected and tumor cells. To maintain immune homeostasis, NK cells avoid attacking normal cells by recognizing self-MHC molecules. Additionally, NK cells modulate the immune microenvironment by secreting cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, which activate macrophages, DCs, and T cells, thereby amplifying the immune response [ 68 By modulating the function of these cells, PVLNs may hold promise in the treatment of infectious, oncological, and autoimmune diseases. However, current research regarding the regulation of neutrophil and natural killer (NK) cell functions by PVLNs remains limited. Nevertheless, existing studies have demonstrated that PVLNs regulate neutrophil recruitment and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Exosomes derived from Coptis chinensis ( Cc Fig. 4 69 70 Fig. 4 The pathway mechanism of PVLNs in regulating the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Fig. 4 Similarly, direct studies on the immunomodulatory effects of PVLNs on NK cells are scarce. Nonetheless, some research has confirmed that plant polysaccharides can enhance NK cell cytotoxicity and secretion, thereby boosting anti-tumor immunity [ 71 4 Mechanisms of action of PVLNs in regulating adaptive immune cells Adaptive immunity is a crucial defense mechanism in higher organisms, characterized by the recognition of specific foreign antigens by APCs. This recognition activates immune effector cells, leading to either humoral immunity, via antibody neutralization, or cell-mediated immunity, such as cytotoxic T-cells clearing infected cells. Adaptive immunity relies heavily on the functions of T cells and B cells, which exert their protective effects through distinct mechanisms. Research has confirmed that PVLNs not only modulate the fundamental functions of the innate immune system but also exert significant effects on adaptive immune modulation, immunosuppression, and immune enhancement by influencing T cell activation, differentiation, and proliferation( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 The mechanism of PVLNs in regulating the pathways of T cell activation, differentiation, recruitment, and reprogramming. Fig. 5 4.1 T-cell T-cell activation is central to the adaptive immune system, involving complex signaling by APCs. APCs present antigenic peptides through the MHC, providing the initial signal for binding to the T-cell receptor (TCR). TCR signaling alone is insufficient for full T cell activation; additional signals, such as CD28 binding to B7, along with cytokine signals like IL-23 and IL-6, are necessary to facilitate T cell activation. Activated T cells rely on a specific cytokine environment for subsequent differentiation and development [ 72 73 4.1.1 Regulation of T-cell activation According to research reports, PVLNs influence T cell activation both directly and indirectly. PVLNs can activate T cells by directly binding to surface receptors, such as C-type lectin receptors. For instance, garlic-derived nanoparticles (GNPs) can directly induce the activation and proliferation of γδ T cells by binding to C-type lectin receptors, such as Dectin-1, on intestinal γδ T cells via specific surface ligands, thereby regulating T cell activation. This process not only bypasses the traditional major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-dependent antigen presentation pathway but also promotes the secretion of high levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by γδ T cells through activation of the C-type lectin receptor signaling cascade, including Syk kinase and the downstream nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Ultimately, these effects reshape the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor immune responses. However, the precise mechanisms by which GNPs induce T cell differentiation remain to be elucidated [ 74 Additionally, PVLNs can indirectly influence T cell activation by affecting the antigen-presenting functions of APCs. For example, Exosome-like particles derived from broccoli regulate the expression of antigen-presenting molecules on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) through activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway within these cells. Furthermore, these particles suppress the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-S6 kinase (S6K) axis, thereby attenuating the differentiation of T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) subsets. Collectively, this regulatory network maintains intestinal immune homeostasis by suppressing T cell activation and the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators [ 60 4.1.2 Regulation of T-cell differentiation direction PVLNs primarily affect specific subsets, such as Th1 cells. For instance, ceramide, a key lipid component of GDNPs, induces macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-12p70 via a TLR4-dependent signaling pathway. IL-12 is crucial for Th1 cell differentiation, activating more CD4 + 50 75 Additionally, T cell reprogramming, defined as a change in the direction of differentiation, can be induced by external factors such as cytokines under specific circumstances. T cell reprogramming typically alters immune function, facilitating the differentiation of T cells into specific subtypes, such as from CD4 + + + + + + 76 However, it has been demonstrated that PVLNs can mitigate inflammatory responses by modulating microbial metabolism, thereby inducing reprogramming of differentiated T cells. For example, exosome-like nanoparticles derived from Portulaca oleracea L. (PELNs) significantly elevate intestinal indole derivative levels by enhancing the proliferation and metabolic activity of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri. These metabolites activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in conventional CD4 + + + + 77 4.1.3 Regulation of T-cell recruitment Chemokines are pivotal in T-cell recruitment and directed migration. PVLNs regulate T-cell recruitment by enhancing chemokine secretion from various immune cells. For instance, certain PVLNs, like ginseng-derived exosomes (GDNPs), have been demonstrated to interact with receptors on T cell surfaces by upregulating chemokine expression (e.g., CCL5, CXCL9), thus promoting T lymphocyte infiltration and contributing to antitumor immune responses [ 50 74 4.2 B-cell B cells are crucial components of adaptive immunity, producing specific antibodies to recognize and neutralize pathogens and participating in the formation of immune memory to confer long-term protection to the organism [ 78 However, certain phytochemicals found in plant extracts, such as curcumin and resveratrol, have been shown to regulate B cell differentiation and function through multiple molecular targets. Curcumin induces the differentiation of B cells into immunoregulatory B10 cells (CD19 + + + 79 80 81 82 The role of PVLNs in regulating adaptive immunity has unveiled their growing potential in the treatment of various diseases, particularly in anti-inflammatory responses, immune tolerance, allergies, and autoimmune diseases. Currently, PVLNs have demonstrated a regulatory role in T cell-mediated adaptive immunity. Future research should explore how PVLNs could regulate B-cell functions to achieve comprehensive control over adaptive immunity. 5 PVLNs in immune-related diseases PVLNs, as natural nanocarriers, have garnered significant attention in the fields of immunomodulation and disease treatment recently, owing to their low immunogenicity, high biocompatibility, and ease of preparation. Research indicates that PVLNs transport active components like miRNAs, proteins, and lipid molecules. These components can directly or indirectly modulate the immune system to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and pro-restorative effects through various mechanisms ( Fig. 6 Table 2 Fig. 6 Administration routes and mechanisms of action of PVLNs in treating various immune-related diseases.

Inhibit pathogenic bacteria and promote the growth of probiotics [ 106 5.1 Diseases of the digestive system The immune system is crucial for the proper functioning of the digestive system. To maintain immune homeostasis in the gut, the immune system must effectively defend against pathogens while avoiding excessive responses to food antigens and commensal microbes. Disruption of this balance can result in increased inflammation or immunosuppression [ 107 108 109 Traditional treatments for digestive diseases, such as immunological agents and anti-inflammatory drugs, can be effective in the short term [ 110 111 The development of inflammatory diseases and tumors in the gastrointestinal system is closely linked to chronic inflammation [ 112 113 Fig. 7 86 114 Fig. 7 Application of Plant-Derived Exosome-Like Nanoparticles (PVLNs) in Digestive Diseases.

Fig. 7 In recent years, the gut microbiome has been recognized as a crucial ecosystem that regulates host immune homeostasis and influences disease susceptibility. Accumulating evidence indicates that PVLNs not only directly interact with intestinal mucosal immune cells but also substantially impact the metabolism and activity of the gut microbiota, thereby facilitating multi-level immune regulation [ 115 116 89 43 77 117 5.2 Skin diseases The cutaneous immune system maintains skin barrier integrity and protects against tissue injury, infection, and diseases by regulating inflammation and promoting repair [ 118 119 In recent years, nanomaterial-based transdermal drug delivery platforms have significantly enhanced the absorption and diffusion of drugs across the skin barrier [ 120 121 92 91 122 75 [123] [124] [125] 2 2 126 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Application of PVLNs in Treating Skin Wounds.

(B) Scavenging Effect of BFR-EVs on Excess Intracellular ROS: Changes in intracellular ROS levels induced by H 2 2 Fig. 8 However, the precise anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms of PVLNs require further investigation before clinical application. Future research should focus on analyzing the roles of each component in inflammation, oxidative stress, and the healing processes of skin wounds. Additionally, it is crucial to explore how PVLNs can precisely regulate inflammatory mediators in wounds to ensure effective bactericidal action in the early stages while preventing excessive inflammatory responses. 5.3 Metabolic diseases The immune system interacts dynamically with metabolic organs to maintain metabolic homeostasis. This is achieved through mechanisms such as cytokine secretion, metabolic signal sensing, and regulation of immune cell functions. Metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, often involve abnormal activation of the immune system and a chronic inflammatory state. This includes the sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6, known as \"metabolic inflammation\". These inflammatory factors disrupt insulin signaling pathways, leading to insulin resistance. This exacerbates metabolic disorders by promoting lipid accumulation and hepatic steatosis [ 127 128 Research has shown that PVLNs can interact with immune cells, modulate their activation and metabolic activities, and inhibit pro-inflammatory factor expression, thus alleviating metabolic inflammation. For instance, Garlic-Derived Exosome-Like Nanoparticles (GaELNs) were observed to lower levels of pro-inflammatory factors like IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in an obese mouse model, reducing obesity linked brain and systemic inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect is attributed to the binding of Phosphatidic Acid (PA) from GaELNs to mouse Brain Acid Soluble Protein 1 (BASP1), a Ca 2 129 Additionally, oxidative stress is a key pathological mechanism in metabolic diseases, which PVLNs mitigate by enhancing the synthesis of intracellular antioxidant enzyme systems ( Fig. 9 95 Fig. 9 Applications of PVLNs in Metabolic Diseases.

Fig. 9 5.4 Cardiovascular diseases Cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Their development is intricately linked to chronic inflammation and immune imbalance [ 130 32 131 132 133 134 Studies indicate that PVLNs can decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, in vascular calcification through their specialized components, thus slowing down disease progression. For instance, Panax ginseng-derived exosomes (PDNs) lower levels of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-6) and boost the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) in brain tissue by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway via specific lipid fractions. This action inhibits microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory responses, thereby alleviating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury [ 97 Fig. 10 100 98 Fig. 10 Application of PVLNs in cardiovascular disease.

Fig. 10 5.5 Neurodegenerative diseases The onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) are closely linked to immune imbalances, especially when the dynamic balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is disrupted [ 135 136 137 Immunomodulatory therapies have shown potential in ameliorating neuroinflammation and slowing down the process of CNS damage [ 136 138 48 Existing studies have reported that the therapeutic mechanism of PVLNs in neurodegenerative diseases lies in the regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated inflammation and the reduction of oxidative stress to protect the neurological effects such as Pueraria Mirifica exosomes can be administered intranasally, allowing them to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. By delivering bioactive microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from traditional Chinese medicine, these exosomes enhance PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitochondrial autophagic clearance, preserve mitochondrial respiratory chain integrity, replenish cellular ATP levels, mitigate neuroinflammation resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction, and promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the Parkinson's disease (PD) environment, thereby alleviating PD symptoms [ 101 Fig. 11 102 139 Fig. 11 Application of PVLNs in Neurodegenerative Disease.

Fig. 11 5.6 Infectious diseases Infectious diseases are caused by diverse pathogens, predominantly bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These microorganisms invade the host via multiple pathways, disrupting tissue architecture and impairing the host's immune defense system, ultimately triggering disease development. Pathogens, particularly bacteria, employ mechanisms including surface adhesion factors, toxin secretion, and biofilm formation to evade immune clearance, thereby facilitating chronic and persistent infections [ 140 141 Current therapeutic approaches for infectious diseases primarily depend on antibiotics, antiviral agents, and immunotherapies. However, these conventional therapies confront numerous challenges, including the emergence of bacterial resistance and viral mutations associated with prolonged antibiotic administration, thereby complicating treatment efficacy [ 142 143 144 Recent studies indicate that PVLNs exhibit diverse biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which contribute to the regulation of microbiota stability, inhibition of pathogen growth, promotion of tissue repair, and mitigation of adverse effects associated with conventional therapies. Notably, specific lipid components on the surface of PVLNs, such as phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), bind to bacterial surface receptors, facilitating selective recognition and uptake. For instance, ginger-derived PVLNs (GELNs), enriched in PA, specifically interact with the HBP35 protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen implicated in periodontitis, thereby facilitating GELN uptake [ 104 116 Fig. 12 104 Fig. 12 Application of PVLNs in Infectious diseases.

Under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution International License(CC BY 4.0). Fig. 12 Furthermore, certain PVLNs can directly neutralize virulence factors secreted by pathogens. For example, dandelion-derived PVLNs (TH-EVNs) specifically bind extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), exerting anti-virulence effects that inhibit hemolytic reactions and significantly reduce hemolysis rates. Experimental evidence suggests that the neutralization mechanism of TH-EVNs is likely due to the physical barrier they form, thereby preventing host cell infection by S. aureus EVs [ 105 145 5.7 Relationship between family and genus of plants and disease efficacy In recent years, the therapeutic efficacy of PVLNs in diverse immune-related diseases has been increasingly substantiated. Compared to conventional chemical drugs and biologics, PVLNs demonstrate distinct biological advantages, including multi-target regulation, excellent biocompatibility, and minimal toxicity and adverse effects. Analysis of the correlation between the plant families yielding PVLNs and their target diseases reveals that specific plant families preferentially correspond to certain therapeutic areas ( Table 3 Table 3 Comparison of PVLNs treatment with conventional therapies in various immune-related diseases.

Disadvantages •The mechanism of action is complex and difficult to analyze. •Batch stability is challenging. •Clinical data are lacking. •Large-scale production is difficult. •Significant systemic side effects •Resistance (e.g., antibiotics) •Safety risks for long-term use •Some conditions are managed only symptomatically Ref. [ 16 157 158 [ [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] Among PVLNs derived from plants targeting gastrointestinal diseases, those from the Zingiberaceae family are rich in gingerol, which exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-motility effects by inhibiting COX-2 and TNF-α pathways, partially overlapping with traditional immunosuppressants (e.g., anti-TNF agents) but with a milder profile [ 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 In summary, the selection of plants for PVLNs derivation should be guided by aligning their bioactive components with the core pathological mechanisms of the targeted diseases, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysregulation. The therapeutic efficacy of these plants can be further corroborated by evidence from traditional medical systems. Moreover, by integrating chemical taxonomy with genomics and proteomics and harnessing advances in artificial intelligence, bioactive plant compounds can be identified and analyzed through predictive modeling to forecast their medicinal efficacy and therapeutic potential, thereby enabling more precise disease interventions [ 156 6 Preparation and engineering of PVLNs The therapeutic efficacy of PVLNs largely depends on their bioactive constituents—including miRNAs, lipids, and enzymes—and the preservation of their structural integrity. However, the complex plant tissue matrix—comprising cellulose networks, polysaccharides, and phenolic compounds—poses significant challenges for efficient and damage-free isolation. Existing isolation methods exhibit limitations regarding yield, purity, and bioactivity retention, thereby necessitating the development of more efficient and standardized isolation and characterization strategies to ensure reproducibility in functional studies and clinical translation. 6.1 Separation, purification, and characterisation techniques for PVLNs Compared to MDEVs, the extraction methods for PVLNs share similarities yet also exhibit differences [ 170 171 172 36 173 174 175 The core separation and purification strategy for pre-treated PVLNs must balance purity and activity. Methods for extracting and separating plant exosomes primarily include differential ultracentrifugation, density gradient centrifugation, immunoprecipitation, filtration, microfluidic technology, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [ 24 Table 4 176 56 17 177 Table 4 Comparative analysis of PVLNs extraction methods. Table 4 Method Separation Principle Advantages Limitations Ref. Ultracentrifugation Based on particle density and size differences, separation via high-speed sedimentation.

High specificity, ideal for functional studies, and High separation efficiency. High cost, relies on commercial antibody availability, Low throughput, unsuitable for large-scale applications. [ 17 193 Extracted PVLNs can be characterised using various methods, including optical analysis techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) for particle size distribution and Zeta potential analysis, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for tracking individual particles. Morphology and size can be visually assessed using microscopy imaging techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, the analysis of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and other active molecules in PVLNs can be further elucidated through detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), protein blotting, mass spectrometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to clarify their molecular composition [ 178 Currently, there are no unified standards for the extraction and characterisation of PVLNs. Some studies have proposed Tetraspanin-8 (TET8, a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins with functional homology to the mammalian exosome marker protein CD63) as a potential plant marker. Currently, TET8 antibody immunoprecipitation is used to enrich specific PVLNs, but it is not present in all plant exosomes and serves as a marker for specific subtypes [ 179 180 The scalability of PVLNs in clinical applications is hindered by low yields, high energy consumption, and contamination risks from plant-specific impurities (such as polysaccharides and polyphenols), which increase production costs. To enhance economic efficiency, strategies such as optimizing plant species selection (e.g., high-yielding Zingiberaceae) and integrating separation methods with large-scale production potential (e.g., tangential flow filtration [ 181 6.2 Engineering for the design of PVLNs Nanoparticles, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles, and bio-derived vesicles, are widely utilized as carriers for the targeted delivery and controlled release of drugs. The primary advantage of nanoparticle carriers lies in their ability to enhance the bioavailability of drugs while simultaneously minimizing toxicity and side effects within the body. Nonetheless, the clinical application of these carriers is hindered by challenges such as carrier stability, safety, and long-term storage, necessitating sophisticated engineering design in drug delivery and immunomodulation [ 194 195 157 6.2.1 Improvement of targeting The treatment of diverse diseases, including intestinal inflammation, tumors, and neurodegenerative disorders, underscores the necessity for the precise delivery of PVLNs to specific target tissues or cells. Compared to artificial nanocarriers, PVLNs possess intrinsic targeting abilities—such as specificity for the gastrointestinal tract and other organs—primarily due to the presence of distinctive lipids and protein adhesion molecules on their surfaces. However, their natural targeting properties are often insufficient to achieve the precise therapeutic outcomes required for the treatment of various diseases. Nevertheless, the abundance of bioactive molecules on the PVLN surface offers numerous sites for surface modification, thereby enabling extensive customization through engineering approaches. Such modifications can enhance their in vivo targeting efficiency and improve therapeutic efficacy [ 196 To further enhance the specific targeting of drug carriers and minimize damage to non-targeted tissues, the key to engineering PVLNs for improved targeting lies in developing carriers with active targeting properties through the modification of specific targeting molecules. In a recent study, researchers employed hydrophobic insertion to conjugate folic acid (FA-PEG-Chol) onto ginger exosome membranes, generating folic acid-modified ginger-derived exosome-like vesicles (FA-GDEVs). In a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model, FA-GDEVs selectively accumulated in inflamed joints and were efficiently internalized by pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. Mechanistically, FA-GDEVs activated the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, facilitating the polarization shift from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, thereby significantly alleviating joint swelling and cartilage erosion [ 197 198 101 6.2.2 Improvement of drug loading capacity PVLNs have recently emerged as a novel drug delivery platform, characterized by a diverse array of bioactive components. However, in therapeutic applications, exogenous drugs or nucleic acids are frequently loaded onto PVLNs to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. Conditions including chronic wounds, cardiovascular diseases, and tumors necessitate drugs possessing anti-inflammatory, tissue-regenerative, and anticancer properties. Therefore, investigating effective drug loading strategies is a critical step toward the development and optimization of their clinical applications. Drug loading strategies for extracellular vesicles (EVs) are generally classified as either active or passive, according to their underlying mechanisms. Passive loading depends on diffusion and lipophilic interactions between drug molecules and vesicular membranes, typically involving the co-incubation of PVLNs with drug molecules at defined temperatures. Although this approach is relatively straightforward, it often results in lower encapsulation efficiency. In contrast, active loading employs physical or chemical methods to transiently disrupt the vesicle membrane, forming temporary pores that facilitate drug entry or improve drug-carrier affinity through covalent modifications. Methods such as electroporation, ultrasonic treatment, and freeze-thaw cycles are commonly used for active loading. This strategy can increase the drug loading capacity of PVLNs by more than eleven-fold [ 158 199 200 201 202 It is important to note that drug encapsulation ability is a crucial factor in demonstrating drug delivery efficiency. Some drugs, such as indocyanine green, have remodeled the structure of PVLNs through osmotic stress, resulting in an increase in long hydrocarbon chain lipids and a decrease in intracapsular proteins. This remodeling facilitates the expansion of the internal space of PVLNs, thereby enhancing drug loading capacity [ 203 Although a wide range of drug loading and release technologies have been developed, challenges remain in their standardization. For instance, there are significant differences in loading efficiency, drug stability, and membrane integrity across different techniques. Moreover, balancing efficient drug loading with the preservation of post-release bioactivity requires further investigation. Therefore, future engineering of PVLNs will focus more on improving loading efficiency and release precision while avoiding excessive damage to their natural membrane structure. 6.2.3 Enhancement of stability and slow-release property The natural stabilizing properties of PVLNs significantly influence their mode of drug delivery. PVLNs have been reported in various delivery modes, including oral, injectable, and transdermal delivery. Among these, oral delivery is currently the most commonly used, primarily due to the higher stability of PVLNs in acidic environments compared to other nanocarriers, which demonstrates unique resistance to acidic and enzymatic degradation [ 204 205 206 Experimental results indicate that PVLNs demonstrate substantial acid tolerance and enzymatic stability when administered orally for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, in systemic therapies such as intravenous administration, the rapid clearance of PVLNs by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) shortens their half-life, thereby limiting bioavailability and therapeutic persistence. Therefore, enhancing the in vivo stability of PVLNs and prolonging their circulation time represent key research directions for improving their efficacy in the treatment of systemic diseases. The circulating half-life of PVLNs and the reduction of non-specific immune clearance can be significantly improved by membrane surface modification techniques. For instance, PEGylated corn-derived extracellular nanoparticles (cNPs) exhibit enhanced retention in systemic circulation, with retention rates positively correlated with the degree of PEGylation. Owing to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, these cNPs can be efficiently delivered to tumor tissues [ 207 208 6.2.4 Enhancement of immunomodulation PVLNs exhibit substantial potential in immune regulation owing to their bioactive compounds derived from plant sources. However, their immunoregulatory effects in their natural state remain constrained and insufficient to fulfill the requirements for effective immune modulation in specific immune-related diseases, including autoimmune and infectious diseases. Consequently, engineering PVLNs to augment their application within the immune system has emerged as a prominent area of research. Membrane hybridization represents an effective strategy to boost the immunomodulatory effects of PVLNs. By fusing PVLNs with membranes from diverse origins, such as bacteria, immune cells, or even tumor cell membranes, new functional properties can be imparted. For instance, it has been reported that hybrid bacterial-plant nanovesicles (BPNs), formed by fusing bacterial outer membrane vesicles with spinach-derived nanovesicles, effectively target tumor tissues and activate immune cells, promoting tumor-associated antigen presentation and enhancing immune responses [ 209 210 211 Due to the complexity and diversity of PVLNs, the development of their engineering still requires further exploration. Future advancements in plant vesicle modification methods could include: 1. Multifunctional modification: Combining multiple modification strategies, such as chemical coupling with genetic engineering, to endow plant vesicles with multi-targeting capabilities and functions. 2. Smart response modification: Developing intelligent modifications capable of responding to specific environmental stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, or enzymes) to enable vesicles to release drugs under specific conditions. 3. Personalized customization: Customizing the targeting modifications of plant vesicles to suit the specific needs of individual patients, thereby improving the precision and effectiveness of treatment. Through these modification approaches, plant vesicles are expected to become safe, effective, and controllable drug delivery systems in the future, providing a new tool for the advancement of precision medicine. 7 Optimization of PVLNs’ storage The storage of PVLNs is crucial to ensuring their stability and functionality. Currently, the primary method for long-term storage of PVLNs involves cryopreservation at −80 °C. This approach slows the degradation of EVs and maintains the stability of their lipid bilayer membranes and protein components, preserving their biological activity. Studies have shown that storing EVs in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C can maintain their activity for up to one week, whereas freezing at −20 °C or −80 °C preserves their integrity for much longer durations [ 212 213 Optimizing storage methods for EVs is essential to maintaining their stability and functionality. Developing innovative storage solutions, such as room temperature-stable formulations, represents a promising research direction [ 214 215 8 The safety and ethics of PVLNs Although PVLNs are regarded as promising biological therapeutics owing to their low immunogenicity, natural origin, and sustainability, systematic safety and ethical evaluations are urgently needed before clinical translation. Currently, systematic investigations into the toxicological profiles of PVLNs remain limited. As PVLNs are exogenous nanoparticles, there is a theoretical risk of eliciting abnormal immune responses or even infections in the host. Most current studies focus on the short-term efficacy and functional characterization of PVLNs. Although some animal studies indicate that PVLNs do not cause acute toxicity or systemic infections following oral or injectable administration in mice [ 216 217 218 Importantly, lower immunogenicity does not equate to a lack of allergenicity. Certain bioactive components derived from plants, such as proteins and lipids, may induce allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, typically manifesting as asthma [ 219 220 221 222 The development and application of PVLNs also encompass a range of ethical considerations, including the sustainability of source materials, standardization of production processes, informed consent, and risk disclosure. The procurement of plant materials should adhere to principles of sustainable development and biodiversity conservation to avoid adverse environmental impacts. As a novel biopharmaceutical, PVLNs should be accompanied by comprehensive risk disclosure to participants before clinical trials, particularly regarding uncertainties related to allergies, infections, and immune regulation, to ensure participants’ right to informed consent and autonomy. Currently, only a limited number of clinical trials involving PVLNs have been conducted. Two clinical trials have been completed, investigating inflammatory bowel disease ( NCT04879810 NCT01668849 9 Future and perspectives In recent years, natural PVLNs have demonstrated distinctive anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and tissue-repairing properties, and have increasingly been developed and applied for the treatment of systemic diseases related to immune dysregulation. This review summarizes the latest advancements and applications of PVLNs in modulating both innate and adaptive immunity, aiming to highlight their substantial immunomodulatory potential. Nevertheless, despite their promising prospects, current research on PVLNs faces several challenges, particularly regarding mechanistic elucidation, standardized preparation, and clinical translation [ 16 Although multiple studies have demonstrated that PVLNs modulate immune responses by regulating cytokine secretion, influencing immune cell function, and reducing oxidative stress [ 223 8 Future PVLN research should adopt multidisciplinary approaches, foster technological innovation, and emphasize clinical validation to facilitate systematic breakthroughs in understanding their immunomodulatory mechanisms and applications. First, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer novel approaches for optimizing PVLN loading. Integrating deep learning with high-throughput screening can enable multi-parameter prediction and engineered design of PVLN loading efficiency, targeting capabilities, and libraries of active ingredients. For instance, current machine learning models can effectively predict the toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties of medicinal plants using large experimental datasets, thereby facilitating the intelligent design of efficient delivery systems for immunomodulatory agents [ 156 224 225 For clinical applications, a phased translational research roadmap is recommended: the initial phase should involve multi-center, multi-model animal studies to systematically evaluate the safety, efficacy, and immune regulatory capacity of PVLNs; the second phase should advance small-scale preclinical trials to optimize preparation processes and quality control standards; and the third phase should involve designing multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trials to validate efficacy and safety in specific disease contexts (such as autoimmune disorders and tumor immunotherapy). Standardization efforts should focus on establishing internationally recognized protocols for PVLN traceability, purification, characterization, and functional testing to facilitate industrialization and clinical translation. Overall, research on PVLNs in immune regulation is progressing rapidly. Although limitations remain in mechanistic elucidation, technical optimization, and clinical validation, their potential therapeutic value is increasingly apparent. By further strengthening basic research, refining preparation processes, developing more precise characterization techniques, and fostering multidisciplinary collaboration alongside clinical application, this field is poised to achieve significant breakthroughs, offering new possibilities for the treatment of diverse immune-related diseases.
