Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a kind of mental disorder with high mortality, suicide and relapse rates, and might be the world's leading cause of health burden by 2030. Growing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is closely linked to depressive pathogenesis and suggests that MDD can be called a microglia disease. And activation of the P2X7R/NLRP3 signaling pathway in microglia is a key mechanism causing nerve damage. In addition, it is recently found that gut microbiota might initiate neuroinflammatory processes underlying MDD, and gut microbiota dysbiosis can be affected by sleep to ameliorate neuroinflammatory processes. In this paper, we reviewed recent advances about gut-brain axis interactions with neuroinflammation, which might shed light on the mechanisms and treatment of depression. neuroinflammation MDD gut-brain axis microglia astrocytes The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Global statistics have indicated approximately half of annual 800,000 suicide deaths are due to individuals diagnosed with MDD. Notably, depressed individuals exhibit a nearly 20-fold higher risk of suicide mortality compared with the general population ( 1 2 The monoamine hypothesis has dominated MDD research, and the first-line treatment for MDD are still conventional antidepressants which primarily target monoamine neurotransmitter modulation ( 3 5 6 7 In addition, emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in neuropsychiatric disorders, including MDD, anxiety, and Alzheimer’s disease. Promisingly, the probiotic Bifidobacterium adolescentis 8 9 10 11 2 Gut-brain axis The brain regulates gastrointestinal sensory, motor, and secretory functions via neuroendocrine pathways including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system. The gut in turn influences the central nervous system (CNS) through different pathways such as gut microbiota-derived metabolites, neurotransmitters, hormones, etc., which influence the enteric nervous system (ENS) and the immune system. This complex bidirectional pathway can be called the brain-gut axis (GBA). The gut microbiota (GM), comprising over 10 14 Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria 12 Many substances are involved in the gut-brain axis, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and peptides that are not absorbed by the host. These substances can be metabolized by intestinal microorganisms to produce a variety of biologically active substances, including amino acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), organic acids, phenolic compounds, phenylalanine derivatives, and indoles ( 12 2.1 Gut-brain axis and sleep Emerging research showed that sleep disorder is not only an important process that accompany MDD, but also showed significant cross-talk with the gut microbiota. Many recent studies have proved that microbiota can affect sleep through some specific pathways, and gut microbiota might be the reason for sleep changes at ageing, thus both the gut microbiota and sleep changes are suggested to be significant signatures that are associated with health and disease in the last decades of life ( 13 14 15 16 17 18 Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus 17 18 In addition, it is of our interest that chronic sleep disruption impacts gut microbiota. A study in animals has revealed that chronic sleep fragmentation alters taxonomic profiles of fecal microbiota and induces systemic and adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance ( 19 phyla Verrucomicrobia Lentisphaerae 20 21 22 2.2 Gut-brain axis and neuroinflammation Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory response caused by dysregulation of the synthesis and release of various pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brain ( 23 24 Clinical studies have discovered the presence of various inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in brains of patients with MDD patients who committed suicide, and the levels of these inflammatory factors were significantly higher than those of normal individuals ( 25 26 28 26 2.3 The GBA and neuroinfllamation in MDD In recent years, with the rapid advancement of molecular biology, the gut microbiota has become a prominent topic in scientific research. Gut microbiota are composed of several species of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The dominant gut microbial phyla are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria Verrucomicrobia Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Lactobacillus Bacillus Clostridium Enterococcus Ruminicoccus Clostridium Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Bacteroides Prevotella Actinobacteria Bifidobacterium 29 30 Lactobacillus reuteri Blautia producta Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been increasingly linked to a variety of chronic diseases, including metabolic, immune, and neurological disorders ( 30 Odoribacter, Rikenella, Streptococcus, Anaerotruncus Clostridium, and Helicobacter 31 32 33 In addition, antibiotics can clear the gut of bacteria, thereby reducing bacterial translocation, decreasing the liver burden, and alleviating neuroinflammation, thus providing therapeutic effects. For example, rifaximin, an unabsorbable, broad-spectrum, gastrointestinal-specific antibiotic, lowers serum ammonia and endotoxin levels, potentially alleviating symptoms ( 34 35 36 37 Compared with healthy populations, patients with MDD exhibit significant alterations in gut microbiota diversity and taxonomic composition. Metagenomic analyses found that MDD patients demonstrate elevated relative abundances of Eggerthella(Actinobacteria), Subdoligranulum Coprococcus (Lachnospiraceae) Ruminococcaceae. Clostridiales Sellimonas 38 39 40 41 GBA-targeted interventions has demonstrated potential antidepressant therapy effects, and it is found that matrine can reverse CUMS-induced Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio imbalance in mice, concurrently upregulating hippocampal BDNF expression to ameliorate depressive behaviors ( 42 Lactobacillus helveticus 43 44 45 27 Recent studies have found that gut microbiota-derived metabolites play a pivotal regulatory role in the pathogenesis of MDD (  Figure 1 12 46 Akkermansia 46 47 48 38 49 Bacteroidetes Firmicutes 50  Figure 1 Figure 1 A schematic cartoon shows the interaction between gut microbiota and neuroinflammation to induce MDD. The brain-gut-microbiota axis interacts through neural signaling, immune signaling, and chemical signaling. When gut microbiota dysbiosis occurs due to stress or other factors, the released metabolites (SCFAs, LPS, TMAO) can cause damage to the CNS (increased BBB permeability, glial cell activation, neuronal damage). The stress response to CNS damage can further alter the gut microbiota, stimulating inflammatory responses, creating a vicious cycle that leads to MDD.

Diagram showing interactions between the CNS, ENS, and gut. The central nervous system (CNS) includes activated microglia and astrocytes leading to inflammation and neuron damage. Blood-brain barrier disruption involves astrocyte and monocytes. The enteric nervous system (ENS) and gut depict intestinal barrier disruption, influenced by microbial metabolites like TMAO, SCFAs, LPS, and bacteria such as Lactobacillus reuteri and Escherichia coli, impacting inflammatory mediators IL-6 and IL-18. 3 Core pathways of gut microbiota in regulating neuroinflammation 3.1 Gut microbiota-glia axis in neuroinflammation The results of a growing number of studies ( 51 52  Figure 1 53 54 55 Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) can stimulate resting-state microglia through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or ATP receptors, respectively, and convert them to the M1 type under the action of IFN-γ ( 56 57 33 26 58 59 Interestingly, it is recently found that gut microbiota is a critical regulator of microglial function and stress susceptibility. Some studies reported that germ-free mice exhibited reduced expression of genes associated with inflammation and immune surveillance in microglia, alongside higher cell density and distinct morphological features—including a more segmented morphology, longer processes, and increased branching complexity ( 60 28 28 Lactobacillus reuteri 61 62 Lactobacillus reuteri Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium 63 64 3.2 Astrocytes, microglia and neuroinflammation Astrocytes are also involved in neuroinflammation in MDD via interaction synergistically with microglia, for example, upon microglial activation, astrocytes can amplify inflammatory signals and produce neurotoxic factors ( 65 67 68 69 70 71 Christensenellaceae Blautia Lactobacillus 72 Astrocytes are the most sensitive cells in the brain, that can sense the environmental changes such as cytokines, metabolites ( 73 74 75 Broadly, gut microbiota can regulate astrocyte through immune, vagal, neuroendocrine, and microbial metabolite-mediated pathways. Immune pathways play a pivotal role in preserving the homeostasis between the gut microbiota and astrocytes. Gut dysbiosis generates pro-inflammatory cytokines that cross the BBB, activating astrocytes and microgila to drive their transition to an inflammatory phenotype. Under steady-state conditions, TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) expression in astrocytes is driven by interferon-γ (IFNγ) produced by meningeal natural killer (NK) cells. LAMP1 + + 76 77 78 56 3.3 Microglia in neuroinflammation in MDD There are two steps that activate inflammation in microglia: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or ATP receptors. In response to chronic stress, PAMPs or DAMPs activate pattern-recognition, neuroinflammation in microglia can be activated by damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) or pathogen- associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to activate NFκB, and TLR-mediated activation of the NF-κβ pathway serves as the first signal and promotes the up-regulation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. As a second step, ATP activation of P2X7R encourages the binding of NLRP3 to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and activates caspase-1, which converts and releases IL-1β and IL-18 precursors into mature forms (  Figure 2 + Figure 2 Microglia and neuroinflammation under MDD. The classic NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires two steps: the priming process involves pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)/damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or cytokine-induced NF-κB activation. After NF-κB enters the cell nucleus, the transcription of inflammasome-related genes is unregulated. The activation process requires various exogenous and endogenous molecules (such as ATP, etc.). Other signaling events, such as K + Diagram illustrating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Signal 1 involves PAMPs/DAMPs binding to TLR4, leading to NF-kB activation and priming of NLRP3. Signal 2 is triggered by ATP via the P2X7 receptor, causing potassium efflux. This leads to NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, activating caspase-1. Caspase-1 converts pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, IL-1β and IL-18. Components include MyD88, ASC, and inactive NLRP3. 3.4 Molecular mechanism of neuroinflammation in MDD 3.4.1 TLRs, NF-κB, and MDD TLRs belong to a family of pattern recognition receptors, the first line of immune defense in the human body. Even though there are a diverse repertoire of TLRs (e.g., TLR2 for bacterial lipoproteins, TLR3 for dsRNA, TLR7/8 for ssRNA, TLR9 for CpG DNA), TLR4 is arguably the most critical member in the context of sensing specific danger signals associated with neuroinflammation macrophages and microglia express. TLR4 recognizes PAMPs and DAMPs, as well as heat shock proteins, high mobility group proteins, LPS, and microbial-associated pattern molecules in macrophages and microglia. It is believed that TLR4 receptors can signal through both MyD88 and non-MyD88 pathways to activate NF-κB, thereby promoting the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that TLR4 activation plays a vital role in neuroinflammation and is an independent risk factor for MDD severity. Some studies found that experimental animals given lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an agonist of the TLR4 receptor, can exhibit depressive-like behaviors such as decreased interest, pleasure, appetite, and increased despair time ( 79 8 73 80 3.4.2 ATP/P2X7R and MDD Stress induced ATP release plays a pivot role in neuroinflammation in MDD patients, and P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), an ATP-gated non-selective cation channel, that is widely expressed in glial cells and neurons, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis, sensory pathways, and immune response. P2X7R not only promotes microglia migration and phagocytosis but also regulates microglia secretion of pro-inflammatory factors and chemokines. Studies have shown that extracellular ATP can combine with P2X7R to promote the release of pro-inflammatory factors, such as IL-1β and IL-18, which enhance neuroinflammation ( 81 82 Several studies have also confirmed the involvement of P2X7R in the development of neuroinflammation which triggers MDD, and it is found that the expression of P2X7 is positively correlated with MDD. For example, Ren et al. ( 83 84 85 86 87 + + 3.4.3 NLRP3/Caspase-1 and MDD The relationship between the NLRPs (NOD-, LRR, and pyrin domain containing) family and MDD has attracted much attention in recent studies, particularly the NLR family pyrin structural domain 3 (NLRP3). NLRP3 is activated enzymatically and binds to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), which recruits pro-Caspase1 protein, to form NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles. NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles mediate the proteolytic cleavage of pro-Caspase1, activating caspase-1 and ultimately inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activity of NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles and its moderate regulation determine the morphology of microglia and the intensity of neuroinflammatory responses (  Figure 2 88 It has been shown that patients diagnosed with MDD have significantly elevated mRNA levels of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in their blood ( 89 90 91 92 93 46 94 3.5 Gut microbiota modulates the inflammation pathways Gut microbiota collaborates with the molecular mechanisms described above to regulate neuroinflammation, forming an intricate gut-brain axis network. For example, LPS and butyrate are two important microbial metabolites in neuroinflammation. Butyrate produced by the Lachnospiraceae family inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), thereby blocking the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit. Meanwhile, LPS binds to the TLR4/MD2 complex, triggering MyD88/TRIF-dependent IKK phosphorylation, thereby releasing IκB’s inhibition of NF-κB and driving the transcription of TNF-α and IL-6. And improving LPS levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88 pathway with herbal formula Zuogui Jiangtang Jieyu (ZJJ) by downregulating Gram-negative bacteria abundance alleviated diabetes-associated MDD ( 95 96 97 98 P2X7R is expressed in intestinal cells and plays a role in both health and disease in the gastrointestinal system. Under pathological conditions, the intestinal barrier is disrupted, leading to decreased levels of ZO-1 and claudin-1, increased ATP release by the microbiota, and activation of P2X7R. When the concentration of extracellular ATP produced by the intestinal microbiota is high, the sIgA response induced by intestinal lymphoid tissue is suppressed, thereby facilitating the colonization of pathogenic bacteria ( 99 100 The assembly and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes are key steps in the process by which gut microbiota dysbiosis drives neuroinflammation, which in turn promotes the onset and progression of MDD. Caspase-1 inhibition via genetic knockout or pharmacological intervention reduces depression and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Depressive behavior was improved in NLRP3-/- mice, and the types of gut bacteria (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Ruminococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroidetes) were also altered ( 101 102 103 104 4 The effects of neuroinflammation on the nervous system 4.1 Neuroinflammation affects synaptic plasticity Synaptic plasticity underpins both structural and functional plasticity of the nervous system, with structural plasticity denoting alterations in the quantity, morphology, and architecture of the pre- and post-synaptic membranes and their interstices resulting from internal and external stimuli. Conversely, functional plasticity pertains to alterations in the intensity or efficacy of synaptic transmission, primarily long-term synaptic plasticity, encompassing long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term MDD (LTD). Impaired synaptic plasticity can readily result in cognitive and emotional learning and adaptions, and finally emotional related problems, including MDD. In the resting state, microglia govern synaptic pruning to enhance synaptic functional stabilization. When glial cells are activated due to neuroinflammation, too much secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines influence synaptic plasticity. Nguyen et al. ( 105 106 4.2 Neuroinflammation inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis Chronic stress can lead to atrophy, apoptosis, and reduction in the number of hippocampal neurons; thus, neuronal regeneration is a crucial mechanism for recovery from MDD ( 2 107 Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) refers to the neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and maturation processes in the adult hippocampus. The AHN comprises a sequence of neurogenic cascade reactions wherein the DG undergoes asymmetric divisions to produce neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which subsequently differentiate into adult neuronal cells. The surviving adult neuronal cells evolve into immature neurons, ultimately maturing into DG granule neurons that integrate into the established hippocampal circuitry. The heightened expression of pro-inflammatory genes in mice subjected to Repeated social defeat (RSD) indicated a notable decrease in early neuronal markers DCX on day ten post-RSD. At the same time, impaired differentiation of NPC neurons proliferating during RSD was observed after 28 days, coinciding with the activation of neuroinflammation ( 108 109 111 Indeed, it is found that the number of NCSs in the DG region of the hippocampus is reduced in MDD patients, and vascularization is decreased. In addition, neuroimaging studies have shown ( 112 113 114 4.3 Neurotrophic factors Briain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is one of the most well-studied neurotrophic factors, a key player in psychiatric disorders, and one of the reliable biomarkers used to monitor MDD. BDNF can initiate multiple signaling pathways by activating distinct receptor types, primarily the TrkB and the p75 neurotrophic factor receptor (p75NTR) pathways, which can activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by binding to TrkB, etc ( 115 116 Cytokines released during glial cell activation at neuroinflammation are posited to obstruct neurotrophic signaling in neurons, thereby impeding BDNF-induced activation of PI3K and Erk1/2, which subsequently hinder axon growth and neuronal marker expression, culminating in neuronal apoptosis ( 117 118 119 120 121 5 Conclusion and limitations With the advances of research on MDD, there has been a better understanding of the specific mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in MDD. The brain-gut axis, which is a complex interactive system, plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of MDD. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota can produce metabolites that compromise barrier functions and trigger the release of inflammatory factors. Additionally, these metabolites activate glial cells, leading to neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis, ultimately contributing to neuroinflammation. Therefore, targeting the brain-gut axis to suppress glial cell activity and reduce their inflammatory activation may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for MDD. In addition, sleep disorders, which is related with both the etiology of MDD and also affects the gut microbiota, can modulate the inter-play among the gut microbiota and neuroinflammation. However, many concerns about precise mechanisms of the brain-gut axis in MDD remain to be elucidated. Further elucidation of these mechanisms will lay the foundation for developing novel antidepressant drugs, breaking through the limitations of traditional monoamine-based treatments. For example, traditional monoamine hypothesis suggested that MDD is due to limitation of the three monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine and 5-HT), and antidepressants that can increase in these three monoamines can alleviate MDD. The role of brain-gut axis in modulation of the monoamines are still need to be explained, indeed, 90–95% of serotonin in the whole body is produced in the gastrointestinal tract, thus the interplay between brain-gut axis with monoamines might shed more light on the mechanisms of MDD.
