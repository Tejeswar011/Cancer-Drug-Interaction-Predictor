In recent years, research interest in the sexuality of gender minority individuals has grown, as shown by the increasing number of publications on this topic. Accordingly, a comprehensive systematic review which synthesizes the range of sex-related variables captured in research studies with non-binary people is needed. This analysis examined 12 years of quantitative sex research, aiming to (1) outline what is known about the sexuality, sexual health, and relationship satisfaction of non-binary people; and (2) appraise measures used in this literature for the inclusivity of non-binary identities (focusing on language and terminology). Searches were conducted on PsycINFO, Web of Science, and MEDLINE for papers in Italian or English between 2012 and 2024, and 44 articles were included for synthesis. Papers covered a wide range of topics, showing that non-binary people often report non-monosexual sexual identities (e.g., queer, pansexual), more attraction to and relationships with other non-binary individuals, and similar levels of sexual and relationship satisfaction as binary transgender people. However, the language and tools employed within the research were not always expansive or inclusive enough to adequately represent non-binary people’s experiences. For example, gender minority individuals were often grouped together for analysis, hiding likely within group differences. Future research should use gender-neutral language and measures and consider non-binary individuals separately, in order to better understand their specific sexual health, well-being, and relationship needs and outcomes.

Transgender (or trans) is a word used to describe the identity of someone who identifies with a gender that does not match the sex they were assigned at birth (American Psychological Association & National Association of School Psychologists, 2015 2021 2020 Nonetheless, although others have noted the importance of recognizing that the intersection between one’s gender, self-identification, and sexuality can shape individual health needs (Zeeman et al., 2017 2016 2022a 2019 2023 2024 2016 2022 Although sexual health has long been recognized as a broad and multifaceted construct (e.g., Edwards & Coleman, 2004 2023 2021 2022 2015 As this field is evolving rapidly, a clearer understanding of the existing literature on the sexuality and sexual health of non-binary individuals is needed to better comprehend and evaluate the state of the science, how non-binary people are being identified and included in sex research, and if and how their experiences are being captured. Current Systematic Review The current systematic review synthesizes 12 years of quantitative research on the sexuality and sexual health of non-binary populations, including a wide range of sexual constructs (such as sexual orientation, fluidity, sexual well-being, and sexual satisfaction), to develop a broader understanding of the literature in this area and to acknowledge the multifaceted and complex nature of sexuality and sexual health. We chose to include articles published in the last 12 years to capture recent and current understandings and conceptualizations of non-binary identities. More specifically, we decided to focus on research published after 2012 for two main different reasons: From a research perspective, 2012 marks the year the US Gallup poll collected data related to sexual orientation and transgender identity for the first time (Gallup Organization, 2012 2012 2015 From a generational perspective, we wanted to include studies with millennials (individuals born between 1981 and 1996) as well as gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012) as participants. This is because younger individuals are more likely to identify as non-binary (Statistics Canada, 2022 2022 2022 2022 This review adds to existing systematic reviews (e.g., Marshall et al., 2020 2023 2019 More specifically, the underlying research questions of this review are: What does quantitative research tell us about sexuality, sexual health, well-being, and relationship satisfaction/quality among non-binary adults? How inclusive of non-binary people is quantitative sex research with respect to measurement and terminology? Method For this systematic review, we adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al., 2021 2013 1 Table 1 Inclusion/exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria 1. Includes variables relating to sexuality, sexual health, or relationship satisfaction/quality (including sexual orientation, sexual fluidity, sexual satisfaction, sexual well-being, sexual function/dysfunction, orgasm, sexual fantasy, sexual preferences, sexual distress, and sexual behavior) 1. Exclude if only data on HIV/STI prevalence, treatment, or preventive measures (e.g., PrEP) are presented, as this is the focus of previous systematic reviews (e.g., Dang et al., 2022 2018 2. Published in peer review publications 2. Grey literature, conference articles, theses, and other non-peer reviewed publications 3. Empirical analysis (primary research and secondary data analysis were included) 3. No empirical analysis 4. Directly involves non-binary and/or transgender individuals as participants 4. Exclude if study only reports others’ perceptions or opinions, such as family members or partners 5. Presents quantitative analyses (more specifically, used a quantitative measure to assess sexuality, sexual health, or relationship related constructs). Mixed-method studies that included a quantitative approach to data relating to sexuality and relationships were also included 5. Qualitatively analyses 6. Mean sample age over 16 years 6. Mean sample age below 16 years, focus on children 7. Published in English or Italian 7. Other languages were not included in this review 8. Published between 2012 and 2022 (initially, later updated to 2024) 8. Articles published prior to 2012 were not examined 9. Has separate analyses/descriptives for individuals that identify outside the gender binary (accepted labels were all labels relating to non-binary identities, such as \"non-binary,\" \"genderqueer,\" \"agender,\" or labels that group multiple identities outside of men and women together, such as \"other\") 9. Papers that did not differentiate non-binary and binary trans or cis people were not included 10. Includes samples from Europe, North America, and/or Australia and New Zealand 10. Due to cultural differences in the understanding and categorizations of non-binary genders, papers referring to non-western samples were not included Information Sources Initial searches were conducted on the databases PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Web of Science in September 2022. Searches were then updated in August 2024. Hand searches were also performed by manually searching the reference lists of included papers. Search Strategy The keywords (in title or abstract) used to perform the search are reported in Supplementary Table 1. Some of the keywords referring to gender are now obsolete and were included with the aim of capturing older or more medicalized literature. Selection Process For the English papers, the initial number of retrieved articles in September 2022 was 22,864, of which 5535 were identified as duplicates. For the Italian articles, 36 were initially retrieved, of which one was a duplicate. The updated searches conducted in August 2024 returned a total of 3296 additional English papers and one Italian paper that had been published between October 2022 and August 2024. Duplicates were identified through a mix of manual screening and use of the Endnote software automatic screening tool. Overall, only one Italian language paper was included past the screening phase, but it was later excluded because the full-text could not be retrieved. (Figs. 1 2 Fig. 1 PRISMA chart for English searches Fig. 2 PRISMA chart for Italian searches After piloting inclusion and exclusion criteria, all titles, abstract and full texts were sourced and screened by the first author, while the last author screened 20% independently. Inter-rater reliability was calculated between 0.84 and 0.91 for each phase, and discrepancies were discussed until resolved. Any papers which were unclear as to their inclusion were also screened by both and and subsequently discussed. After the initial search, 192 English language articles were identified. However, it is relevant to highlight that after screening for the inclusion of non-binary participants, 155 of these articles (80.7%) did not include any non-binary participants or did not report separate analyses for non-binary and binary transgender individuals and were therefore excluded. An additional 8 articles were excluded as they reported on samples from outside Europe, North America, Australia, and/or New Zealand. Lastly, one paper was identified through handsearching, resulting in 30 articles included after the initial search. During the search update, 97 papers were identified for possible inclusion; however, 52 of these (53.6%) were excluded as they did not separate between binary trans and non-binary participants. As such, an additional 14 papers were added following the search update, resulting in a total of 44 papers included in this review. Data Extraction Data extraction was completed primarily by the first author in consultation with the other authors, following a standardized protocol based on a piloted and pre-agreed extraction table that included: Study date/location/authors Sample information and sampling method Demographics (e.g., gender identity of participants, age, ethnicity and race for whole sample and non-binary participants when available) Method of asking about gender identity and trans identity Sexual variables considered in the study (e.g., sexual orientation, sexual fluidity, etc.) Scales used to measure main sexuality constructs (completed by non-binary people) Main findings After information was extracted, authors discussed any queries or uncertainties until consensus was reached. For extracted demographics, separate data were included for non-binary participants when available. If unavailable, only general sample characteristics were reported. For other variables, results were only reported if separate analysis for non-binary individuals were available. Study Risk of Bias Assessment To appraise the quality of all included studies, the standard quality assessment criteria for evaluating primary research papers for quantitative studies was used (Kmet et al., 2004 Two reviewers independently assessed a sample of papers (10% of total), and any disagreements were discussed until resolved. Inter-rater reliability was calculated at 0.74. After this, the first author completed the quality assessment in consultation with the second and third authors, with any doubts being discussed until consensus was reached. Data Analysis For the primary research question, studies were grouped for synthesis based on the reported sexual and relationship related variables. Information relating to study design, study and participant characteristics, and gender identity assessment and non-binary labels was synthesized in a narrative manner. For the secondary research question, we report which scales were used to assess sexuality, sexual health, and relationship satisfaction and whether these measures were inclusive of the non-binary population (e.g., whether they used gender-neutral language in terms of pronouns, body parts etc., or if they recognized the existence of genders outside of men and women—for instance when asking about sexual attraction). Results Quality Assessment Most studies (39/44) were high quality, while five papers were classified as moderate quality.

Non-binary individuals reported attraction toward both men and women (Anzani & Prunas, 2020 2020 2023 2019 2022b 2022 2022a 2022 2023 Gender of Sexual Partners Regarding the gender of sexual partners, both Holt et al. ( 2023 2022 2020 2023 2024 2018 2018 Sexual Fantasy Three papers reported exploring non-binary people’s sexual fantasies. Although there were no significant differences in fantasies about dominance/control and partner humiliation between non-binary and cisgender participants, non-binary people reported significantly less arousal than cisgender adults in relation to some fantasies (such as kink or sexual engagement with attractive and older/more experienced partners; Anzani & Prunas, 2020 2020 M M M M 2024 M M 2024 2024 Sexual Behavior Higher Risk Behaviors In terms of higher risk sexual behavior, Kattari et al. ( 2019 2016 2022 Conversely, one study including Australian transgender individuals found that non-binary people were as likely as trans binary people to have had condomless intercourse in the last year, but more likely to report ever having used drugs for sex (Holt et al., 2023 One paper looked at casual sex during Covid-19 lockdown, finding that this was not associated with gender identity (Nadarzynski et al., 2023 Lastly, one paper found that being non-binary was not significantly associated with higher likelihood of having had sex with someone of unknown STI/HIV status in the past 12 months (Pletta et al., 2022 2024 Number of Sexual Partners Number of sexual partners in the last year and across the lifetime was similar between non-binary and binary transgender aged 14 to 21 (2.7 partners in the last 12 months and around 5 lifetime partners; Fisher et al., 2018 2021 Being Sexually Active and Other Sexual Behaviors Holt et al. ( 2023 2020 2023 2024 2024 Sexual Fluidity The two papers that examined sexual fluidity both focused on the US context. The first paper (Katz-Wise et al., 2016 n 2016 2023 2023 Sexual Satisfaction and Relationship Satisfaction Three papers looked at both sexual and relationship satisfaction (Holt et al., 2023 2018 2024 2021 2023 2022b Relationship Structure Three papers discussed monogamous and non-monogamous relationship structures in relation to non-binary individuals. Non-binary people were more likely than cisgender men (16.7% vs. 1.8%) to be in polyamorous relationships (Rutherford et al., 2021 2023 2020 Sexual Health Attendance and Negative Experiences in Health Care Four studies looked at sexual health care attendance and discrimination experiences. In a sample of LGBT UK adults, identifying as non-binary was not associated with sexual health clinic attendance compared to other trans people (Hibbert et al., 2020 2021 In terms of negative experiences and discrimination within sexual health care, one paper found that AFAB non-binary individuals reported the most “gender insensitivity” (i.e., experiences of transphobia and cisgenderism), and non-binary participants in general found hospitals to be the most gender insensitive providers while community-based services were the least insensitive (Rosenberg et al., 2021 2021 Other Sexual Variables: Sexual Function, Well-Being, Self-Concept, Consent Attitudes, Porn Use, Assertiveness, Pleasure, and Desire Other sexual variables were considered in single studies only and tended to focus on whether significant differences occurred between non-binary and binary (both trans and cis) individuals. Regarding sexual desire (Mark et al., 2018 2021 2021 Non-binary people reported greater discrepancies than cisgender people (but not trans binary people) in relation to “actual/ought” sexual self-concept (their ideas of who they currently are and their self-imposed expectation on who they should be in relation to their sexuality) and “actual/ideal” sexual self-concept (their ideas of who they are compare to who they would like to be as a sexual being; Kennis et al., 2022a 2022a 2022a M M M 2024 2020 2023 2024 2024 Lastly, Perez and Pepping ( 2024 2024 Discussion The current systematic review aimed to analyze the existing quantitative research on the sexuality and sexual health of non-binary people to synthesize and evaluate the literature results, appraise language inclusivity, and discuss potential gaps in knowledge. Most papers that investigated sexual orientation reported that non-binary people typically endorsed non-monosexual identities and identities that do not reference gender (e.g., queer, pansexual). This might reflect a tendency of non-binary individuals to move away from sexual identity labels that are not reflective of their gender expansiveness (Kuper et al., 2012 2016 2022 2014 In relation to sexual health, studies found that non-binary people often experienced cisgenderism and transphobia from their care providers, which has been linked with negative health effects, such as less frequent STI testing in gender-diverse individuals (Rosenberg et al., 2021 2021 2021 2021 2024 Another topic of interest for this review was the use of inclusive language in quantitative sex research with non-binary participants. Generally speaking, studies that measured sexual attraction and behavior did so in a way that ignored genders outside the binary, focusing on attraction toward men and woman only. Consistently, although most studies included an option to articulate one’s sexual identity label using a text box, some of the analyzed papers included only a small range of default options, which might not be appropriate for non-binary people. Importantly, an understanding of sexual orientation that is rooted in a binary conceptualization of gender might be inadequate and reductive for individuals who endorse a trans and/or non-binary identity (Galupo et al., 2014 In relation to other sexual variables, although not all items used were reported, overall language appeared to be gender neutral, with authors sometimes changing the original scale’s verbiage to improve inclusivity. In some cases, “binary” pronouns, a gendered prospective or references to biological sex (Anzani & Prunas, 2020 2021 2018 2023 Reviewed papers had some limitations. In relation to study characteristics, all papers were cross-sectional (or only performed cross-sectional analysis), which limits our understanding of how sexual and relationship related variables might evolve over time. Additionally, authors often did not, or were unable to, include non-binary people as a standalone group for their inferential analysis. This resulted in all individuals who did not neatly fit the gender binary being relegated to an “other-gender” category or in non-binary and binary transgender people being grouped together. Consequently, much of the information reported in this review comes from descriptive statistics, limiting our ability to generalize results to the wider non-binary population. Moreover, trans identification within the non-binary population was mostly disregarded and not assessed which could impact our understanding of how non-binary people who identify as trans and those who do not, differ in relation to their sexuality. Gender categorization in quantitative research should explore cisgender/transgender and binary/non-binary self-classifications and account for uncommon labels as chosen by participants (Beischel et al., 2023 The assimilation of different gender identities in a single subgroup appeared to be due to the inability of most studies to recruit a significant number of non-binary individuals, to the point where meaningful statistics that focused on a non-binary subgroup could not be performed. Issues with recruitment may be partially explained by the fact that non-binary people are a relatively small and marginalized population (e.g., at the 2021 UK census, non-binary people represent 0.06% of people over 16 living in England and Wales; Office for National Statistics, 2023 2021 We also found that measures used to assess sexual variables by the included studies were mostly created ad hoc and/or were not validated for use with non-binary or transgender populations. This reflects a more pervasive issue with research on gender-diverse individuals: a lack of validated psychometric tools for gender minority populations (Keo-Meier & Fitzgerald, 2017 2020 From our analysis, it is apparent that this field is expanding and that literature on non-binary people is becoming more prevalent (as supported by the fact that 33/44 papers included in this review were published between 2020 and 2024). Nonetheless, research in this area is in its infancy. Notably, during the screening phase of this review, most of the research identified by the search strategy was not inclusive of non-binary people and either did not differentiate between trans and non-binary samples or did not mention non-binary people at all. Accordingly, the majority of papers retrieved via searching were not included in this review (see Supplementary Table 2). Even when the papers met inclusion criteria, non-binary people often seemed to be an afterthought, with measures lacking appropriate validation and language representing experiences outside of binarism. This is particularly true of older research included in this review. More empirically sound research, specifically focusing on the non-binary population as the main group of interest, is especially needed. Finally, the wider societal impact of non-binary inclusive research warrants significant attention, with data showing a growing trend among younger generations to identify outside the gender binary (e.g., Gallup Organization, 2024 2022 2022 2020 Recommendations for Future Research Based on the described findings and current limitations of the field, some recommendations can be made. In general, more research of non-binary experiences on sexual topics, such as sexual well-being, satisfaction in sexuality and relationships, sexual fluidity, fantasy, and assertiveness is needed. Such research needs to have appropriately powered samples, and where possible, a longitudinal design to assess changes over time. Studies that explore differences between binary transgender and non-binary individuals are especially lacking and this limits our understanding of possible differences between them. It is likely that binary transgender and non-binary individuals have different sexual needs and experiences which should be accounted for. In terms of measurement, there is a need to produce, adapt and/or validate scales with non-binary people to increase confidence in the legitimacy of results. When assessing sexual identity, presenting a variety of label options, particularly plurisexual and gender-neutral options like pansexual and queer, should be the norm. Similarly, non-binary identities should be included as response options in relation to sexual attraction and behavior related items (e.g., when assessing the gender identity of past, current, or potential partners), to allow non-binary people (and their partners) to more easily express their full range of sexual feelings and experiences. When conducting research with this population, authors also need to ensure that language is neutral and that any ambiguity (e.g., confusion between sex/gender) or unnecessary focus on sex assigned at birth is avoided. Finally, researchers need to ensure that gender diversity is kept at the forefront of research by involving non-binary people in studies about non-binary people from the very beginning. Limitations of This Systematic Review This systematic review has several limitations. Firstly, the focus on western samples and definitions of what it means to be non-binary might have created bias. However, this was an intentional choice because of variations in cultural understandings about non-binary identities. Additionally, we recognize that western categorizations of non-binary identities are also subjected to cultural influences, which can further limit our analysis. Secondly, this review focused only on quantitative research published in English and Italian, and we are therefore unable to discuss how qualitative studies might have addressed sexual variables in non-binary populations and in other languages. Selection bias might have impacted the researchers’ impartiality; however, this was addressed by means of detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria and two independent coders being involved in the screening process. Conclusion Although studies that include non-binary people are increasing, literature with a specific focus on non-binary individuals is still severely lacking. In order to fill current gaps in knowledge in a meaningful way, researchers need to establish a clearer focus on individuals that challenge and/or disrupt gender binarism by validating tools for non-binary people, using inclusive language, and enhancing community consultation practices. Amplifying non-binary voices within academia has the potential to generate credible and impactful research that provides a more nuanced understanding of non-binary people’s sexuality. This will directly benefit the sexual health of gender-diverse populations who have been previously marginalized both within and outside of the research literature focusing on sexual experience.
