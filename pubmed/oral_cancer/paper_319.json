Sensitivity was measured using serial dilutions of quantified plasmids and specificity was evaluated by incorporating DNA from 18 common STI pathogens. The assay’s suitability as a point-of-care testing (POCT) tool was evaluated with the criteria outlined in Target Product Profiles (TPPs). Results The EasyNAT CT/NG assay demonstrated high concordance with Real-Time PCR, with rates of 98.5% for CT and 99.0% for NG. Concordance in urine samples reached 98.6% for CT and 100% for NG, while cervical swabs showed both 97.7% for CT and NG; vaginal and urethral swabs achieved 100% for both pathogens. Among the 198 samples, one urine specimen tested negative for CT by Real-Time PCR but positive by the EasyNAT CT/NG assay, a positive result confirmed by the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG assay. Two cervical swabs, negative for CT and NG by Real-Time PCR, yielded invalid results with the EasyNAT CT/NG assay but were confirmed negative or CT and NG by the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG assay. The EasyNAT CT/NG assay reliably detected CT and NG in turbid specimens, though it may fail with severely hemolytic samples. Its detection limit was 400 copies/mL, with no cross-reactivity observed across 18 other pathogens. Conclusion The EasyNAT CT/NG assay offers rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of CT and NG, proving valuable for infection screening and early diagnosis. It shows promise as a rapid POCT method.

Unlike traditional PCR methods, CPA does not require thermal cycling, making it suitable for POCT and resource-limited settings. The mechanism of CPA involves the use of a strand displacement DNA polymerase and a set of primers that facilitate the exponential amplification of target DNA under constant isothermal conditions (63 ± 2 °C) [ 16 Mycobacterium tuberculosis 17 Mycoplasma pneumoniae 18 Malaria 19 SARS-CoV-2 20 This study aims to evaluate the clinical performance of the EasyNAT CT/NG assay for detecting CT and NG, comparing its efficacy with that of in-house Real-Time PCR, in order to assess its suitability as a rapid POCT method. Materials and methods Sample collection and preparation Patients who visited the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University for CT and NG detection between October 2022 and May 2023 were enrolled in the study. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Based on preliminary data showing a low positivity rate (~ 15%) in routine clinical testing, an enrichment sampling strategy was implemented to ensure adequate statistical power for diagnostic method comparison. All Real-Time PCR positive samples were included in the study, while Real-Time PCR negative samples were randomly selected to achieve the final study cohort of 198 samples. For female participants, endocervical swabs, vaginal swabs, and urine specimens were collected; for male participants, urethral swabs and urine specimens were obtained. Each swab (endocervical, vaginal, or urethral) was placed in a tube with 1 mL of sterile saline, and vortexed to release the sample material. Urine samples were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded and the remaining 1 mL of sediment. All preprocessed specimens were divided into two aliquots, upon which CT and NG tests were conducted immediately. Clinical performance evaluation of the EasyNAT CT/NG assay Two aliquots of preprocessed specimens were analyzed: one was tested for CT and NG using conventional in-house Real-Time fluorescence PCR assay, while the other was evaluated for CT and NG using the EasyNAT CT/NG assay. Real-time PCR assay Each sample was analyzed for CT and NG using automated nucleic acid extraction and real-time fluorescence PCR (Anadas9850, AMPLLY Biotechnologies, Xiamen, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Post-amplification, the software automatically determined the threshold and detection results based on quality control standards. EasyNAT CT/NG assay The EasyNAT CT/NG assay employs a targeted molecular approach to simultaneously detect CT and NG through amplification of pathogen-specific genetic markers. The assay specifically targets the CDS3 gene for CT detection and the porA pseudogene for NG identification. To ensure assay validity and monitor for potential inhibition or technical failures, an exogenous Bacillus subtilis gene serves as the internal control, providing reliable quality assurance throughout the testing process. All tests were performed strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 100 µL of the test sample was added to the cartridge, followed by the addition of the CT/NG DNA extraction solution. The cartridge was then placed in the nucleic acid amplification detection analyzer (UC0208, Ustar Biotechnologies, Hangzhou, China), and the test was initiated by closing the lid and pressing start. Results were automatically displayed and saved upon completion (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Comparison of Conventional Real-Time PCR and EasyNAT Assays for CT/NG Detection: Workflow and Time Efficiency Sensitivity and specificity of the EasyNAT CT/NG assay Sensitivity To determine the sensitivity of the EasyNAT CT/NG assay, CT and NG bacterial solutions, quantified by digital PCR, were serially diluted to 1600, 800, 400, and 200 copies/mL. For each concentration, 100 µL was added to the cartridge after transferring the entire CT/NG DNA extraction solution. The assay was performed using the nucleic acid amplification detection analyzer (UC0208, Ustar Biotechnologies, Hangzhou, China), with 20 replicates per concentration. Specificity To evaluate the specificity of the EasyNAT CT/NG assay, 18 common reproductive tract pathogens were diluted to a final concentration of 10 6 6 Evaluation of the EasyNAT CT/NG assay as a POCT Target Product Profiles (TPPs) criteria provide structured checklists designed to guide both the development and evaluation of STI POCTs. TPPs outline 36 features for POCTs in surveillance, focusing on: (1) Intended Use: Rapid, accurate diagnosis of CT and NG infections for sexually active individuals, high-risk groups, and symptomatic/asymptomatic patients; (2) Performance: ≥90% sensitivity and ≥ 95% specificity; (3) Operational and Usability: Easy to use, room temperature storage, ≥ 12-month shelf life, minimal waste; (4) Cost: < US$ 5, suitable for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); (5) Quality Standards: Internal controls, external QC compatibility. Detailed criteria will be presented in the “Results” section. This study assessed the EasyNAT CT/NG assay against these TPPs for its suitability as a POCT. Statistical analysis The performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive coincidence rate, and negative coincidence rate of the EasyNAT CT/NG assay for detecting CT and NG were evaluated using the conventional real-time fluorescence PCR as the reference standard.

A total of 198 specimens were collected: 88 endocervical swabs (44.4%), 72 urine samples (36.4%), 28 vaginal swabs (14.1%), and 10 male urethral swabs (5.1%). Specimens were assessed for turbidity and hemolysis. Among urine samples, 39 (54.2%) were turbid and 1 (1.4%) was hemolytic. For endocervical swabs, 26 (29.5%) were turbid and 5 (5.7%) were hemolytic. Vaginal swabs showed turbidity in 11 cases (39.3%), with no hemolysis, while one urethral swab (10%) exhibited turbidity, with no hemolysis observed.

Similarly, 196 samples showed consistent NG results, with 2 samples displaying divergent results (Kappa = 0.904). Among the urine samples, 72 provided concurrent NG results, whereas 71 samples reported consistent CT results, and 1 sample yielded a different outcome between the assays (Kappa = 0.972). For endocervical swabs, 86 samples showed concordant CT and NG results, while 2 samples exhibited discrepancies between the assays for both CT (Kappa = 0.913) and NG (Kappa = 0.651). Additionally, 28 vaginal swabs and 10 urethral swabs yielded concurrent CT and NG results across the two assays. Analysis of 198 clinical samples demonstrated that the EasyNAT CT/NG assay had 100% positive concordance for both CT and NG compared to Real-Time PCR, with negative concordance rates of 98.5% for CT and 99.0% for NG (Table 2 n n n 3 ® 4  Table 2 Overall performance of CPA compared to Real-Time PCR for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoeae n CPA qPCR Positive Negative Overall Positive Negative (%) (%) (%) CT Positive 106 ab 1 e 100 96.7 98.5 Negative 0 89 cd Invalid 0 2 f NG Positive 28 ac 0 100 98.8 99.0 Negative 0 168 bde Invalid 0 2 f a, 13 individuals tested positive for both CT and NG with two assays b, 93 individuals tested positive for CT but negative for NG with two assays c, 15 individuals tested positive for NG but negative for CT with two assays d, 74 individuals tested negative for both CT and NG with two assays e, 1 individual tested negative for CT and NG with Real-Time, but positive for CT and negative for NG with CPA assay f, 2 individuals tested negative for CT and NG with Real-Time PCR, but invalid for CT and NG with CPA assay  Table 3 Performance of CPA compared to Real-Time PCR for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Sample type Pathogen CPA RT-PCR PC a NC b OC c Positive Negative (%) (%) (%) Urine CT Positive 38 g 1 100 97.1 98.6 ( n Negative 0 33 NG Positive 20 g 0 100 100 100 Negative 0 52 ES d CT Positive 45 h 0 100 95.3 97.7 ( n Negative 0 41 Invalid 0 2 NG Positive 4 h 0 100 97.6 97.7 Negative 0 82 Invalid 0 2 VS e CT Positive 15 i 0 100 100 100 ( n Negative 0 13 NG Positive 2 i 0 100 100 100 Negative 0 26 US f CT Positive 8 j 0 100 100 100 ( n Negative 0 2 NG Positive 2 j 0 100 100 100 Negative 0 8 a b c d e f g, 7 urine specimens were both positive of CT and NG h, 3 endocervical swabs were both positive of CT and NG i, 2 vaginal swabs were both positive of CT and NG j, 1 urethral swab was both positive of CT and NG  Table 4 Xpert ® Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoeae C. trachomatis N Cases Specimen type Characteristics Real-Time PCR CPA Xpert Real-Time PCR CPA Xpert Case 31 Urine Severe turbidity - + + - - - Case 129 Endocervical swab Severe hemolysis - Invalid* - - Invalid* - Case 139 Endocervical swab Severe hemolysis - Invalid* - - Invalid* - Invalid*, Inner Control (IC) failed Sensitivity and specificity of the EasyNAT CT/NG assay Sensitivity Sensitivity testing revealed that the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the limit of detection was 332.18 copies/mL for CT and 319.21 copies/mL for NG.

It achieves optimal sensitivity and specificity for urine, vaginal, and urethral swabs but only meets minimal standards for endocervical swabs. Additionally, the assay exceeds the recommended cost of 5 USD and lacks eco-friendliness due to its single-use cartridge. However, it supports non-invasive sampling, provides data connectivity, and features user-friendly automated preparation with a simple three-step process. It also includes a sample adequacy control for quality assurance.

POCT enables rapid diagnosis and immediate treatment, which are essential for controlling STI transmission [ 21 22 23 24 In clinical settings, the predominant commercial nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) platforms employed in the duplex detection of CT and NG are the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG, Aptima Combo 2 and Roche Cobas 4800 CT/NG. These platforms have received FDA approval and demonstrate exceptional sensitivity, ranging from 95.6 to 100%, as well as specificity, ranging from 98 to 100%, for both pathogens [ 25 28 The Cepheid Xpert, Aptima Combo 2, Roche Cobas 4800, and EasyNAT platforms are capable of detecting a variety of sample types, including urine, vaginal swabs, and cervical swabs. Notably, the Cepheid Xpert and Aptima Combo 2 extend this capability to include rectal and throat swabs, as approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [ 28 30 31 32 16 32 33 In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened global experts to review POCT technologies for STIs including CT and NG, and finally proposed TPPs outlining 36 analytical and operational characteristics for POCTs in surveillance, screening and case management [ 34 In summary, the EasyNAT CT/NG has the following main shortcomings. Primarily, it functions as a qualitative rather than a quantitative test, lacking the capability to quantify DNA and assess the effectiveness of infection treatment. Secondly, the cost of this assay is now slightly above the WHO standard of under USD 5, necessitating a reduction. Additionally, it cannot detect antimicrobial resistance in NG, a critical need given the challenges in developing POCTs for resistance to antibiotics like ceftriaxone and azithromycin [ 35 36 Conclusion The EasyNAT CT/NG assay exhibits strong concordance with Real-Time PCR in clinical samples. Its simplicity and rapid 30–45 min turnaround time, combined with high sensitivity (detection limit of 400 copies/mL for CT DNA and/or NG DNA) and specificity (no cross-reactivity with other pathogens), make it a suitable POCT for CT and NG detection.
