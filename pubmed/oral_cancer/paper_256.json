Dietary habits are changing, and information about cashew‐induced anaphylaxis is limited. Methods Cases of tree nut‐induced anaphylaxis (TIA) registered from 2007 until April 2024 were extracted from the European Anaphylaxis Registry and analyzed. Results 1389 cases of TIA out of 5945 registered food‐induced reactions (23%) were identified. 1,083 cases with confirmed elicitor status, including 845 children (median age 4 years, 61% male) and 238 adults (38 years, 40% male), were selected for further analysis. The most frequent elicitors among children were cashew ( n n n n n n Conclusion Cashew is an increasing, relevant allergen leading to anaphylaxis and is now the most frequent cause of TIA among children. These findings highlight the need for effective prevention and treatment measures. Almond was a frequent elicitor among adults and should be further monitored. The acute management requires improvement to comply with current guidelines.  Tree nut‐induced anaphylaxis constitutes 23% of food‐induced anaphylaxis among the anaphylaxis registry. Confirmed elicitors differed between children ( n n Cashew‐induced anaphylaxis increased from 2007 to 2024 among children but rarely affects adults ( n almond allergy cashew allergy European Anaphylaxis Registry hazelnut allergy tree nut anaphylaxis NORA e.V 10.13039/501100013362 Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 10.13039/100015879 409525714 Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 10.13039/501100002347 01EA2107B Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) 10.13039/501100001659 310030_207705 The Swiss Cancer Research Foundation KFS‐5979‐08‐2023 EU‐H2020‐MSCA‐COFUND EURIdoc programme 101034170 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  V.

Our data shall support a better clinical understanding of TIA‐affected patients and support measures for improved management. 2 Methods 2.1 European Anaphylaxis Registry The European Anaphylaxis Registry (EAR) [ 17 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05210543 18 2.2 Data Extraction We filtered the EAR (data reported from 2007 (beginning of data collection) until April 4th, 2024) for the elicitor group “tree nut”, which include hazelnut, cashew, walnut, almond, Brazil nut, macadamia nut, pecan nut, pistachio and the category “other rare/unidentified nuts”, which includes for example reactions to nut mixtures where no single nut was identified as the elicitor. Pine nut seeds were not included in the analysis. Except for the overall cohort description, we focused only on cases with confirmed elicitor status. 2.3 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using R, version 4.3.1 (2023‐06‐16) [ 19 20 www.graphpad.com For descriptive analysis, we used Pearson's Chi 2 3 Results 3.1 Case Identification The EAR consists of 16,988 cases meeting the definition of anaphylaxis based on the NIAID/FAAN criteria (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Flow chart depicting the selection process of tree nut‐induced anaphylaxis among cases from the European Anaphylaxis Registry.

In the vast majority of cases, this amount was below or equal to one tablespoon (Figure 3 p p p p FIGURE 3 Amount of allergen‐containing food eliciting the reaction, separated by children and adults. Whiskers indicate the 95%‐confidence intervals. Among children, 36% reacted to less than a teaspoon, and at least six pediatric reactions were elicited by inhalation or skin contact (cashew ( n n n The time between exposure and onset of symptoms was age‐dependent. In 67% of children, the reaction occurred within the first ten minutes and in 96% within less than one hour after allergen contact. Among adults, only 42% reacted within the first ten minutes but 92% within the first hour ( p 3.10 Previous Allergic Reactions and Awareness of the Allergy A previous reaction to the allergen causing the anaphylactic reaction was reported among 25% of children and 33% of adults. Despite that, only 23% of children and 21% of adults were aware of their tree nut allergy beforehand. 3.11 Adrenaline Use, Hospitalization and Long‐Term Management Among patients with a lay treatment, 47 children (13%) and 1 adult (3%) used an AAI. A voluntary question about the availability of an AAI before the reaction was introduced later and revealed that at least 111 children and eleven adults were prescribed an AAI before the reaction, which would suggest a frequency of 42% of children and 9% of adults using the available AAI during the reaction. However, these numbers have to be interpreted with great caution, because it might lead to an overestimation of the actual AAI use as eventually more patients were prescribed AAIs. During professional first‐line treatment, 42% of children and 39% of adults received adrenaline. Adrenaline was used slightly more frequently if the reported reaction was a repetitive reaction instead of a first reaction: during lay treatment, adrenaline was used in 18% of repetitive and 9% of first reactions ( p p S1 3.12 Reporting Countries Anaphylactic reactions to tree nuts were mostly reported from Germany ( n n n S2 3.13 Development of TIA EAR To better understand the elicitor profile of TIA over time, we analyzed the relative frequency of cashew, hazelnut, walnut, and other tree nuts among all reported cases of food‐induced anaphylaxis from 2007 to 2024. As the absolute numbers of reactions are affected by the annual total number and activity of participating centres, we propose the relative frequency among food‐induced anaphylaxis as a proxy. There is a clear increase in the relative frequency of cashew‐induced anaphylaxis from 2007 to 2024 (year of report, Figure 4 S3 FIGURE 4 Relative frequency of cashew‐induced and tree nut excluding cashew‐induced anaphylaxis among all food‐induced anaphylaxis over time. Thin lines indicate exact annual frequencies; thick lines are smoothened. 4 Discussion We report on > 1,000 cases of physician‐diagnosed, real‐life episodes of TIA based on data from the EAR. Tree nuts accounted for 23% of all reported food‐induced anaphylaxis, which confirms their role as one of the most important food allergens in Europe [ 24 Cashew is the most frequent cause of TIA among children, while adults were rarely affected (334/345 cases, 97% pediatric cases). Similar observations in a smaller cohort were made among Swedish emergency department visits, where cashew elicited ten of 24 cases of TIA [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 27 32 31 32 33 5 We observed a clear increasing rate of cashew‐induced anaphylaxis among reported reactions to food. Cashew has been less widespread and relatively easy to avoid in the past [ 32 34 35 36 37 14 38 39 40 41 23 As described previously, hazelnuts and walnuts were frequent elicitors among children and adults in our cohort. Both of these tree nuts contain various allergenic proteins, including storage proteins, LTP, and PR‐10 proteins [ 6 42 43 13 13 15 12 13 44 45 23 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 12 13 44 45 The majority of TIA in our cohort were of moderate severity according to Ring and Messmer and Brown's severity grading systems. Only six patients suffered from cardiac and/or respiratory arrest; none of them had a fatal outcome. This contrasts with previous reports, where tree nuts along with peanuts and cow's milk were frequent elicitors of fatal food‐induced anaphylaxis [ 53 54 54 55 56 57 We present data on more than 1000 physician‐reported real‐life cases of TIA. The data is derived from specialized allergy centers, which ensures high data quality, but might lead to a bias towards more severe or initial reactions to a specific allergen. An under‐representation of adults cannot be excluded, and the prevalence of TIA in general is not reflected. The structure of the EAR prevents us from using newer, food allergy‐specific severity‐grading systems such as the criteria presented from the World Allergy Organization [ 58 Author Contributions V.H. performed the statistical analysis and wrote the manuscript.
