While remarkable work has been done to develop therapies, there is still a need for more treatments to fight this disease. Recently, it was suggested that nisin, an FDA-approved antimicrobial compound, may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Here, we show that nisin does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Surprisingly, nisin treatment leads to reduced host-cell death during infection in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that nisin may mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced pathology.

Nisin reduces the viability of several cell types, including a bovine epithelial cell line, [ 17 18 19 11 1  Fig. 1 Nisin does not affect Vero E6 viability or proliferation. Vero E6 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of nisin for 72 h, and cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. ns, not statistically significant, one-way ANOVA Nisin does not affect peak viral load of SARS-CoV-2 After confirming that nisin did not affect Vero cell viability, we set out to determine if nisin reduced viral load during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because we hypothesized that nisin would interfere with viral entry, we pretreated the host cells with nisin and maintained nisin in the culture media throughout infection. Surprisingly, nisin had no effect on viral load of the Wuhan (Fig. 2 2  Fig. 2 Nisin does not affect peak viral load during infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vero E6 cells were infected with ( A B p p p p Nisin promotes host cell survival during SARS-CoV-2 infection After 48 h of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we started to observe cytopathic effects (CPE), most notably cell rounding and loss of the cell monolayer, with severe CPE at 72 h post-infection. Interestingly, we noticed that the nisin-treated cells showed less CPE at both timepoints. To assess the effects of nisin on host-cell viability, we quantified the viable adherent cells using methylene blue. We observed a dose-dependent increase in viable cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, starting at 48 h post-infection and amplified by 72 h post-infection (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Nisin promotes host cell survival during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vero E6 cells were infected with the original Wuhan strain (WA1) or the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 and treated with nisin at the indicated concentrations. Cell viability was measured by crystal violet (CV) staining ( A B p p p p This increase in viable cells after nisin treatment could be the result of increased proliferation, a decrease in cell death, or a combination thereof. Because nisin does not increase proliferation of uninfected cells (Fig. 1 3 Discussion We set out to determine if the bacteriocin nisin exhibited antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that nisin would interfere with viral entry into host cells, thereby reducing viral load during infection. Surprisingly, nisin had no effect on peak viral load during in vitro infection. However, we observed that nisin promoted cell survival during SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner; thus, nisin may ameliorate infection without reducing viral load. While the antibacterial properties of bacteriocins have been well established, the antiviral properties of these antimicrobial peptides are less well studied and have mixed results. Bacteriocins purified from different bacterial species have been shown to inhibit the enveloped viruses influenza virus A strains H7N7 and H7N1 [ 20 21 Staphylcoccus aureus 22 23 24 11 17 17 It is unclear exactly how nisin reduces cell death induced by SARS-CoV-2. Nisin has been shown to reduce cytotoxicity in Vero cells after treatment with colistin [ 25 26 27 28 27 9 29 30 31 32 18 Cell death during viral infection is a double-edged sword for the host; death of infected cells may benefit the host by stopping the production of new virions and remove a replicative niche, but extensive cell death may lead to tissue damage and increased pathology. Cell death is associated with severe COVID-19 [ 29 30 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 39 34 44 45 Here, we show that nisin reduces cell death during SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro in a dose-dependent manner without affecting viral levels. Thus, nisin may be another weapon in the fight against COVID-19, especially when paired with an inhibitor of viral replication, as combination therapy is a promising strategy [ 46 Materials and methods Cell culture Vero E6 and Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells (kind gifts from Dr. Melanie Ott, UCSF) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eaglel’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA) and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 ® Nisin titration Vero E6 cells were seeded in complete media in a 96-well plate at 4 × 10 4 SARS-CoV-2 infection All work with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted at Biosafety Level 3. One day prior to infection, Vero E6 cells were seeded in complete media in 24-well tissue culture plates at 2.5 × 10 5 4 Plaque assay Supernatants from infected cells were removed 48 h post-infection and stored at -80 °C until plaque assays were performed as previously described [ 47 5 2 RNA isolation and RT-qPCR Cells were washed with DPBS and lysed in Buffer RLT (Qiagen, Netherlands). Lysates were stored at -80 °C until RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Netherlands). Viral RNA was quantified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs, USA), with primers and probes for SARS-CoV-2 proteins N1 (FAM) and N2 (VIC) Research Use Only (RUO; IDT, USA) multiplexed for 45 cycles on QuantStudio 3 Real Time qPCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the kit’s manual. Crystal violet staining Cells were washed with DPBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA). Cells were then stained with a crystal violet solution (20% methanol, 0.1% crystal violet (Fisher Scientific, USA)) and rinsed with water to remove excess stain. To quantify staining levels, crystal violet from dry cells was solubilized in methanol, and absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an Infinite M Nano + plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). Ethidium homodimer III assay Cells were stained with Ethidium Homodimer III (EthD-III) using the EarlyTox Live/Dead Assay Kit (Molecular Devices, USA) for 1 h according to manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence was measured using an Infinite M Nano + plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft) and Prism (GraphPad) using the statistical tests indicated in the figure legends. Data presented here are from a minimum of triplicate measurements from representative experiments.
