Various factors, such as chemical pollutants, drugs, and alcohol, can cause liver injury. 1 2 3 4 5 6 - 9 1 2 5 Several researchers have efforts to find a novel protective agent to reduce the liver adverse effects of CBZ. For example, in one study, rats co-treated with quercetin and CBZ demonstrated marked improvement in both physiological and structural alterations of liver compared to the CBZ-alone ones. 9 Nigella sativa 8 6 et al 7 Melatonin (MEL; N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine) is an indolamine hormone mainly synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan by the pineal gland and many other organs in mammals. This lipophilic and polymorphic hormone plays an important role in eliminating free radicals and stimulating anti-oxidant enzymes and thus, protecting various tissues, including the liver, against different toxicants. 10 11 12 A review of previous studies showed that MEL improves liver and pancreatic tissues injuries in streptozotocin-diabetic rats via 10 13 14 Materials and Methods Chemicals. Carbendazim (purity: 97.00%) and melatonin (powder, ≥ 98.00%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Company (St. Louis, USA). All other chemicals were obtained from Merck Company (Darmstadt, Germany), unless otherwise stated. Animals. This study followed the institutional guidelines regarding the care and use of laboratory animals. The study protocol was approved by the Animal Experiment Committee in Ilam University, Ilam, Iran (No: IR.ILAM.REC.1402.015). All animals were bred and handled in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Twenty-eight male Wistar rats (7 - 9 weeks old and 220 - 250 g) were raised in a 12 hr light/dark cycle at constant room temperature (22.00 ± 2.00 ˚C) with a standard diet in the Veterinary Medicine Laboratory Animal Husbandry Center, Ilam, Iran. Study protocol. After adaptation to new laboratory conditions, the animals were randomly grouped (n = 7) as follows: Negative control group: Rats were intra-peritoneally injected with physiological saline, CBZ group: Rats were given 150 mg kg -1 -1 -1 -1 15-18 Histology and histomorphometry. Excised livers samples were fixed in a 10.00% buffered formalin solution for 48 hr. They were subjected to standard routine tissue processing technique, including dehydration by graded ethyl alcohol concentrations, clearing in xylene, and embedding in paraffin. Then, 5.00-μm-thick tissue sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin method. Histological photographs of liver were taken using a light microscope (BH-2; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera and image analysis software (True Chrom Metrics; Tucsen, Fuzhou, China). Afterwards, all sections were evaluated for the degree of liver alterations, and photographs were evaluated quantitatively. For histom-orphometry examination, six random fields of each section were selected and in each of them, the following parameters were counted and expressed numerically between 0 and 100% according to the methods proposed previously. 19 , 20 per 2 Immunofluorescence examinations. Sections were subjected to dehydration and rehydration with xylene and graded alcohol, respectively. To detect non-specific tissue antigens, the slices were placed in citrate buffer for 10 min in an autoclave (pH: 7.40, 121 ˚C, and two atmospheres). The activity of endogenous peroxidase was removed by 3.00% H 2 2 -1 Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. For qRT-PCR assay, 100 mg of liver tissue was separated and placed in a test tube with 1.00 mL radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (pH: 8.00; sodium chloride: 150 mM, sodium dodecyl sulfate: 0.10%, Tris: 25.00 mM, phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride: 1.00 mM, and sodium fluoride: 50.00 mM). It was mixed and homogenized using a homogenizer. In order to determine the amount of protein in the samples, the Bradford method was used. 21 ® 6 6 6 Statistical analysis. The results were analyzed using SPSS Software (version 16.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, USA). The descriptive values were expressed as the mean ± standard error. To evaluate the normality of the data, the Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used. To determine the difference between the groups, one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey post hoc p Results During this study, one death occurred in the group treated with CBZ. Nevertheless, the animals did not show clinical symptoms during the study. Macroscopic observations showed that animals did not have any anatomical abnormalities. To test whether MEL has hepatoprotective activities, the biochemical and histological changes were evaluated after a liver damage had been induced by CBZ. To evaluate liver injury, liver function enzymes (AST and ALT) in sera were evaluated. The CBZ administration significantly ( p p Fig. 1 The results confirmed obvious hepatic tissue alterations, including increase in degenerated hepatocytes, hyperemia of sinusoids, and leukocyte infiltration, after CBZ treatment. Interestingly, MEL had a protective effect on the liver parenchyma and general integrity of the hepatic blood vessels. Only slight blood congestion was seen in some sections ( Figs. 2 3 Figure 3 On the contrary, CBZ + MEL group showed a significant decrease in the scoring of almost all lesions compared to the group receiving CBZ, and in some parameters it was almost similar to the control group ( Fig. 4 Fig. 1 The effect of melatonin on changes in serum liver function markers caused by carbendazim in rats.

Caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 immunoexpressions in hepatic tissues of all experimental groups are illustrated in Figures 5 8 As shown in Figures 5-8, unlike the control group, the fluorescence intensity of caspase-3 and Bax in the liver tissue increased significantly, whereas the fluorescence intensity of Bcl-2 decreased significantly in the CBZ group. However, treatment of rats with MEL plus CBZ up-regulated the immunoexpression of Bcl-2 and down-regulated the immunoexpression of caspase-3 and Bax ( Figs. 5 8 The expression pattern of miR-122 in liver tissue belonging to the different experimental groups was tested by qRT-PCR method. To confirm the amplification of the specific parts of miR-122, absence of non-specific genes, and pairing of primers, the correctness of performing qRT-PCR reactions was confirmed by drawing standard efficiency graphs, amplification plots, and melting curves.

A very low expression of miR-122 was found in the liver tissue in control and MEL receiving groups. Also, a significant decrease in the expression of miR-122 was observed in CBZ + MEL group compared to CBZ group. Discussion Recently, many reports have found that pesticides and fungicides cause several human and animal health problems, including liver dysfunction. 4 , 5 9 , 22 - 24 Previous studies have reported that CBZ administration in rats has the ability to induce apoptosis, consequently leading to hepatic dysfunction in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 22 , 24 25 - 27 28 29 - 30 31 32 - 34 Along with our histological results, the biochemical findings also confirmed the hepatotoxicity of CBZ. So, the serum levels of AST and ALT, the most indicative markers of liver deterioration, showed significant elevations. These findings are in accordance with the previous studies. 9 , 22 , 24 32 The MEL as a natural anti-oxidant, lipophilic, and polymorphic hormone has long been known to have many biological activities, including protective effects against liver damage. 2 35 - 36 35 One of the limitations of this research was the lack of electron microscopy to examine the details of the structure of the liver and the organs involved in CBZ intoxication, as well as the protective effects of MEL. Another limitation was the absence of determination of anti-inflammatory factors related to MEL-induced hepatoprotection. So far, no study has reported the protective effect of MEL against liver toxicity caused by CBZ; so, the present findings are worth innovation. One of the strengths of this research is the investigating of the possible relationship between hepatic tissue alterations, apoptosis pathway, and miR-122 expression. However, it is important to acknowledge that the discovery of the relationship between MEL, apoptosis, and miR-122 expression requires further investigation. In the present study, increased expression of miR-122 in CBZ group could be related to increased immuno-reactivity of apoptosis marker proteins, and consequently liver histological abnormalities. Furthermore, MEL-mediated hepatoprotection in CBZ-treated rats could involve regulatory mechanisms on miR-122 silencing and anti-apoptosis pathways. Taken together, our results provide a new insight into the ameliorative role of MEL supplementation against CBZ-induced hepatotoxicity.
