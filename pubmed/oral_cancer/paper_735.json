Introduction Among the most important anthropogenic activities that generate trace metal (TM) residues are metallurgy, the leather industry, vehicle emissions, aquaculture and intensive agriculture [ 1 2 3 4 5 One of the more profitable fisheries in the Gulf of California is the finescale triggerfish fishery [ 6 2 7 8 9 10 11 12 The fine-scale triggerfish Balistes polylepis 13 14 15 16 17 15 16 18 19 Despite the significance of B. polylepis B. polylepis 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area NAV is a coastal lagoon complex (~24,000 Ha) located in the southeastern part of the Gulf of California (25.4°–25.7° N and 108.85°–108.55° W) [ 20 21 20 22 Figure 1 2.2. Sample Collection With the assistance of a local fisherman with a valid fishing permit issued from National Fisheries Commission, which is the agency in charge of regulation and issuing licenses of fishing and aquaculture permits [ 23 Balistes 2.3. Sample Preparation To avoid alterations in the results of trace metal concentrations, the plastic and glass material was washed with phosphate-free soap and rinsed with running water. It was then immersed in hydrochloric acid (FAGALAB ® ® ® 24 25 2.4. TM Analysis Detection and quantification of TM were performed by the standard acidic digestion method of the muscles [ 26 ® 3 Muscle samples were set with the acid to react for 4 h until a clear solution was obtained. After the digestion period samples were allowed to cool at room temperature. The resulting solution was placed into a 50 mL flask with deionized water (FRAMAR ® The TM concentrations were determined by triplicate samples following the method NOM-117-SSA1-1994 [ 26 ® Table 1 (1) T M  r e c o v e r y  ( % ) = T M  C e r t i f i e d  v a l u e  ( m g / k g ) R e s u l t e d  T M  ( m g / k g ) × 100 Subsequently, the reading was carried out in the AAS, which begins by optimizing the equipment specifications, such as air and acetylene flow, burner height, slot width, and lamp wavelength for each metal used. After the stabilization time, the calibration curve of each element was read, considering seven calibration points with an average correlation coefficient above 0.99 to ensure accuracy in the analysis of samples and data analyzed in the laboratory. Due to the high content in the samples, Fe, Zn, and Mn were diluted with deionized water. For the concentration of TMs, a linear regression equation (Equation (2)) in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was carried out [ 26 (2) Y = a x + b Y a b To obtain the concentration, x 2.5.

Non-Carcinogenic Risk (THQ) The non-carcinogenic risk of each TM was evaluated based on the Target Hazard Quotient ( THQ 31 THQ EDI RfD RfD 27 (4) T H Q = E D I  R f D Therefore, if the THQ THQ Hazzard Index (HI) HI THQ B. polylepis HI (5) H I =  ∑ I = 1 n T H Q i 2.7. Carcinogenic Risk The incremental probability of a person to develop any type of cancer (ILRC) [ 32 CSFs measure the relative potency of carcinogens due to oral exposure. The EPA has developed CSFs as a result of the quantitative evaluation of exposure (oral) to a carcinogen, calculating the increase in cancer cases in a population [ 33 34 ILCR −4 (6) I L C R  = E D I T M × C S F T M  o r  R f D T M CSFs measure the relative potency of carcinogens due to oral exposure.

Statistical Analysis One-way ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis test for normal and non-normal distribution were performed, respectively. In the case of significant differences, post hoc Tukey HSD (normal distribution), and Conover, Dunn, and Nementi (non-normal distribution), were performed. A Person’s test was performed to determine correlation [ 36 1 3. Results 3.1. Trace Metal Concentrations The size and weight of the fishes showed a normal distribution ranging from 13.0 to 29.50 cm and 60 to 430 g, respectively. Person’s test showed a correlation between size and TM concentration (Pearson α = 0.05; p p p The TM concentration sequence was Zn > Fe > Mn > Cu = Pb > Ni > Cd. The average, maximum and minimum concentration (mg/kg ± SD) were described for each TM. Mn, Zn, Cd, and Pb were the TM concentrations that exceeded the different TM maximum residues limits (MRLs) established by different agencies ( Table 2 After Kruskal–Wallis analyses, a significant highest Zn concentration was described (α = 0.05), while the rest of the TM concentrations showed non-significant differences ( Figure 2 After Kruskal–Wallis statistical analysis (α = 0.05) among sampling periods with FE and Zn concentrations, Fe showed significantly different concentrations during December 2017. The lowest TM concentration was in winter 2018 ( Figure 2 41 42 43 By collecting periods, Cd showed significantly ( p Figure 3 3.2.

On the other hand, Hi > 1 indicates adverse non-cancer health effects including all THQs of the TM over the exposure lifetime ( Table 3 3.4.
