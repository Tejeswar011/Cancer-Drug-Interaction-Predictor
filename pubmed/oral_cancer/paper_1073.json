A key driver of resistance is a subpopulation of tumor cells called glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), which assist the tumor in resisting therapies and regrowth. This review explores the potential of using existing drugs, already approved for other diseases, to target GSCs. Several promising candidates are presented, including drugs used for treating diabetes, high blood pressure, infections, and neurological diseases, many of which can cross the blood–brain barrier. Some of these work by disrupting GSC energy production, others by blocking tumor-promoting signals, and several increase the effectiveness of current chemotherapy. By identifying safe, accessible drugs that target GSCs and improve response to treatment, this approach could open new and faster paths to improve GBM patient outcomes. Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the deadliest types of cancer, characterized by a short life expectancy after diagnosis, mostly related to therapy resistance and recurrence. GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) reside within the tumor and contribute to these features; therefore, finding drugs that specifically target such cells holds promise to halt GBM progression. The primary objective of this work is to comprehensively review and discuss the potential of hard drug repurposing to target GSCs. Several studies evaluating drugs showing anti-GSC activity, originally approved for non-cancer indications, were identified. These mainly included antidiabetics (e.g., Metformin, Phenformin, and Sitagliptin), antihypertensives (e.g., Nicardipine, Doxazosin, and Prazosin), antimicrobials (e.g., Pyrvinium pamoate, Flubendazole, and Clofazimine), and central nervous system-acting drugs (e.g., Chlorpromazine, Fluvoxamine, and Disulfiram). Relevant candidates include those that disrupt GSC metabolism, namely impairing mitochondrial function, such as Metformin, Chlorpromazine, and Pyrvinium pamoate. Multiple signaling pathways may be involved, namely the Wnt, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 pathways, among others. Also significant were those drugs tested in combination, resulting in increased sensitivity to Temozolomide (TMZ), the standard pharmacological treatment available for GBM. Some repurposed agents, such as Disulfiram and Metformin, have already reached clinical testing, although none have yet been incorporated into clinical practice. Importantly, major translational barriers remain, like limited blood–brain barrier penetration and the lack of robust clinical trials. In conclusion, drug repurposing is an affordable and suitable strategy to target GSCs, impairing cell viability, reducing stemness, and enhancing their sensitivity to TMZ, which has potential that should be further explored to improve patients’ clinical outcomes. drug repurposing glioblastoma glioma glioblastoma stem-like cells cancer stem cells This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain cancer, arising from glial stem or precursor cells, as a subtype of gliomas [ 1 2 3 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 A key contributor to treatment failure is the pronounced cellular heterogeneity of GBM, which resembles the complexity of a developing organ and contains cells with stem-like properties [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) at the apex of the tumor cell hierarchy or as a source of less differentiated cells in GBM tumors has been a topic of debate. In this context, a revised definition was proposed in 2024, defining GSCs as cells with long-term self-renewal capacity that generate diverse progeny, while lacking the ability to fully differentiate [ 24 23 25 26 27 28 19 23 29 30 31 21 One increasingly promising approach to circumvent the limitations of traditional drug discovery is drug repurposing, that is, the identification and development of new therapeutic uses for existing drugs. This strategy is especially attractive in the context of GBM, given the high attrition of novel oncologic agents and the urgent clinical need. As highlighted by Ashburn and Thor (2004), drug repurposing reduces cost, accelerates timelines, and leverages existing safety data, thereby accelerating the translational pipeline for anti-cancer therapies [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 Within the domain of GSC-targeted therapy, drug repurposing has gained traction as a method to identify agents capable of selectively impairing stemness properties and sensitizing these cells to standard therapies. However, despite progress in oncology, drug repurposing for GSCs remains underdeveloped. Preclinical challenges include accurately modeling GSC biology, limited systematic testing of repurposed drugs in GSC-enrichment conditions, and additional pharmacological barriers posed by the BBB. At the mechanistic level, therapeutic strategies have focused on three major axes: (i) developmental signaling pathways (e.g., Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt) that sustain stemness; (ii) metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial dependencies that underlie GSC survival; (iii) epigenetic regulation, which enables phenotypic plasticity and therapy evasion [ 21 43 44 45 46 This review explores the landscape of drug repurposing strategies focused on targeting GSCs, with particular emphasis on the repositioning of drugs not originally approved to treat cancer. We summarize the molecular mechanisms underpinning GSC-directed therapies, review landmark and emerging repurposing studies, and assess their translational potential. Ultimately, we argue that an integrated drug-repurposing approach, especially leveraging non-cancer agents with BBB penetrance, holds promise to overcome GSC-driven therapy resistance and address the persistent challenge of GBM treatment. 2. Drug Repurposing in Glioblastoma 2.1. Soft Repurposing in Glioblastoma “Soft repurposing” refers to the strategy of adding new cancer indications for established cancer medicines, an approach that is based on the existence of shared molecular pathways either activated or inhibited between different types of cancers [ 34 3 47 48 49 50 51 52 Many of these examples have been extensively reviewed elsewhere, although most of the studies have primarily focused on targeting the bulk of the tumor instead of specifically targeting glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). In summary, soft repurposing builds on drugs already validated in oncology, while hard repurposing explores drugs from non-oncologic fields, thereby offering greater novelty but also distinct translational challenges. The repurposing of drugs originally developed for conditions other than cancer has a higher potential for innovation and, therefore, will be the focus of this review. 2.2. Hard Repurposing in Glioblastoma Several drugs originally developed for conditions other than cancer have shown promise when repurposed for GBM treatment, so-called “hard repurposing”. These include approved drugs used to treat diabetes mellitus, such as Metformin, antimalarial drugs such as Mefloquine, Chloroquine, and Lumefantrine, and also several drugs used for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Memantine and Pimavanserin, respectively), and schizophrenia or epilepsy (Fluphenazine, Fluspirilene, Valproic Acid, and Levetiracetam) [ 50 53 2.3. Glioblastoma Models for Drug Testing Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), a subpopulation of tumor cells with self-renewal, multipotency, and high tumorigenic potential [ 18 54 55 56 19 56 55 57 3. Specific Targeting of Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells with Repurposed Drugs 3.1. Search Strategy and Selection of Studies To comprehensively explore the strategies to target CSCs in adult GBM with hard-repurposed drugs, a systematized search protocol was defined. The search was performed in PubMed, using the following combination of predefined keywords: (“glioblastoma” OR “glioma” OR “GBM”) AND (“cancer stem cell*” OR “glioma stem cell*” OR “CSC”) and (“drug*” AND (“repurpos*” OR “reposition*”)), on 3 December 2024 ( Table 1 A total of 60 potentially relevant articles were identified. From these, 16 were review articles. Although related to the topic, such reviews did not comprehensively focus on hard-repurposing strategies targeting GSCs, the main goal of the current review. Only studies of adult GBM (IDH1/2–wildtype) with an explicit focus on GSCs in preclinical or translational/clinical settings that evaluated hard repurposing (drugs previously approved for non-oncologic indications) were included. Studies on pediatric GBM, IDH-mutant or non-GBM gliomas, CSC studies not specific to GBM/GSCs, and drugs already approved for any cancer indication were excluded. In total, 28 original articles met these criteria, and their data were extracted and are summarized in Table 2 In addition, the reference lists of relevant reviews and original articles were searched to capture potential repurposed drugs targeting GSCs that may have been missed by the initial search; eligible studies identified through this process were included in the subsequent subsections. Where clinical trial NCT identifiers are provided, they refer to records on ClinicalTrials.gov, and the trial information reflects the database status as assessed on 4 September 2025. 3.2. Identification of Repurposed Drugs Targeting Glioma Stem-like Cells From the selected articles, many different drugs with the potential to target GSCs were identified ( Table 2 Table 3 3.2.1. Repurposed Drugs Used in Patients with Diabetes Metformin is one of the most prescribed drugs for treating prediabetes and diabetes, belonging to the biguanide family of antidiabetic drugs [ 86 85 85 87 88 Figure 1 89 58 88 89 90 Multiple clinical trials, including ongoing studies, are evaluating Metformin in GBM. A completed randomized, prospective, multicenter, controlled Phase II trial ( NCT03243851 91 In GSC-enriched tumor spheres that were generated from GBM primary tumors, Phenformin (another biguanide derivative) inhibited GSC proliferation and self-renewal [ 80 80 Figure 1 Also for type 2 diabetes treatment, Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) inhibitor that increases the levels of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) [ 92 63 63 63 Figure 1 NCT07003542 3.2.2. Repurposed Drugs Used in Patients with Hypertension Based on the complexity of the disease and its difficult control, there are different classes of antihypertensive drugs in the market, such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha and/or beta-adrenergic receptors (AR) blockers, among others [ 93 Nicardipine is a member of the calcium channel blocker class used for hypertension [ 94 68 Figure 1 68 Doxazosin, a long-acting α1-adrenegic receptor (α1-AR) antagonist used in the treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia [ 95 71 Figure 1 96 In cells with stem-like properties isolated from patient-derived GBM tumors that were resistant to TMZ, the treatment with Prazosin (an α1-AR and α2B-AR antagonist antihypertensive drug) induced cell apoptosis, inhibited tumor growth, and prolonged the survival of orthotopic xenografted mice. In this context, Prazosin’s cytotoxic effect was independent of α1-AR and α2B-AR and relied on inhibition of the AKT pathway ( Figure 1 83 3.2.3. Antimicrobial Repurposed Drugs Cancer cells rely on both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration for obtaining energy. Targeting GSC metabolism, which depends heavily on mitochondrial function, is a promising approach for cancer treatment [ 97 98 Antibiotics and Semi-Synthetic Derivatives About a decade ago, erythromycins (e.g., Azithromycin), tetracyclines (e.g., Doxycycline), and glycylcyclines (Tigecycline) were evaluated in several cell lines representative of different cancers (including the GBM established cell line U87 MG), where they inhibited tumor sphere formation [ 84 In several patient-derived GBM cell lines enriched for GSCs [ 99 Figure 1 67 67 Similarly, Minocycline, a semi-synthetic tetracycline, showed selective cytotoxic activity against GSCs, but not against the established cell line U251 [ 58 Importantly, Azithromycin, Doxycycline, and Minocycline may cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), making them more attractive for repurposing in GBM [ 100 101 102 101 Anthelmintics Pyrvinium pamoate, a synthetic anthelmintic drug, inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [ 103 Figure 1 70 More recently, Flubendazole, from the benzimidazole class, was tested in the U251 and LN229 GBM cell lines, inducing cell death by ferroptosis accompanied by p53 and transferrin receptor (TFRC) upregulation, as well as solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) downregulation ( Figure 1 60 104 105 Antifungals The azole antifungals Ketoconazole and Posaconazole increased survival in mice intracranially transplanted with patient-derived GSCs compared to untreated controls [ 75 106 NCT04869449 NCT04825275 Antimycobacterials Clofazimine, mainly used for the treatment of leprosy [ 107 76 76 108 3.2.4. Repurposed Drugs Used in Patients with Central Nervous System Diseases Central nervous system (CNS) drugs are a broad class of medications that primarily target the brain and spinal cord, used to treat a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions. These may include those used to specifically target tumors within the CNS (such as TMZ for GBM), those used for managing cancer-related symptoms or complications [ 109 Antipsychotics Several typical antipsychotics used in the treatment of schizophrenia, including the phenothiazines Trifluoperazine and Chlorpromazine, as well as the diphenylbutylpiperidine derivative Fluspirilene, have demonstrated preclinical activity against GSCs. Trifluoperazine was identified in a mitochondrial inhibitor drug screen as selectively cytotoxic to patient-derived GSCs in vitro, alongside Pyrvinium pamoate [ 70 The treatment of GBM patient-derived cell lines displaying stem-like properties with Chlorpromazine inhibited GSC viability, reduced the formation of tumor spheres, and decreased the expression of stemness markers [ 66 110 66 78 Figure 1 58 Chlorpromazine has been repurposed for GBM treatment in two clinical trials: an active yet incomplete Phase II trial ( NCT04224441 MGMT NCT05190315 Fluspirilene significantly reduced the viability of patient-derived GSCs and decreased their ability to form tumor spheres in a dose-dependent manner [ 77 Figure 1 77 In contrast to typical antipsychotics, the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics Quetiapine and Brexpiprazole, also approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, have shown potential to target GSCs through distinct mechanisms. Quetiapine was shown to reduce proliferation and induce the preferential differentiation to the oligodendrocyte lineage of the murine GBM cell line GL261 cultured in vitro under GSC-enriching conditions, through inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [ 79 Figure 1 111 79 Brexpiprazole was evaluated in CSCs from multiple cancer types, including the GS-Y03 patient-derived cell line [ 73 82 Trifluoperazine and Chlorpromazine are commonly linked to extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and anticholinergic effects [ 112 113 114 115 116 Other CNS Drugs Fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used as an antidepressant, inhibited GSC invasion, both in vitro and in vivo, prolonging survival in orthotopic xenografts. Its mechanism involves inhibition of actin polymerization, which can be related to the suppression of both FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and AKT/mTOR signaling [ 81 Figure 1 Despite presenting moderate translational potential based on robust preclinical efficacy, Fluvoxamine use in GBM is limited by serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated adverse effects and significant drug–drug interaction risks due to potent CYP1A2/2C19 inhibition [ 117 The potential of Disulfiram, a drug used to treat chronic alcoholism [ 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 69 125 69 126 126 127 58 65 Disulfiram, often combined with Copper, has been evaluated in several clinical trials for GBM, including both newly diagnosed and recurrent cases. Across eight registered trials, four were completed ( NCT02715609 NCT01907165 NCT03034135 NCT02678975 NCT03151772 NCT03363659 NCT01777919 122 123 128 129 128 122 123 124 128 129 Importantly, safety concerns have emerged, particularly in larger randomized trials. The addition of Disulfiram and Copper to chemotherapy in recurrent GBM did not improve survival but led to significantly higher rates of severe (grade ≥ 3) and serious adverse events, including hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity [ 122 123 124 128 129 Finally, Trihexyphenidyl, an anti-Parkinsonian agent, was identified in a robotic drug screen and reduced proliferation in a GSC-enriched tumor sphere model (GBM1) [ 72 130 3.2.5. Other Repurposed Drugs and Broader Therapeutic Strategies for Hard Repurposing in GSCs Additional candidates for hard repurposing to target GSCs include N 131 132 59 Figure 1 61 CUSP9, from “coordinated undermining of survival paths”, refers to a combination of nine approved non-cancer drugs, aiming to simultaneously block several signaling pathways [ 133 134 74 Figure 1 NCT02770378 135 Using a bioinformatics-based approach that analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patient-matched primary and recurrent GBM from four public cohorts, without direct drug testing, one study validated the repurposing potential of previously investigated agents and identified additional candidates for future evaluation. The top-ranking target compounds considered to be effective against GSCs were Rosiglitazone, Nizatidine, Pantoprazole, and Tolmetin [ 64 In silico screening also allows the identification of novel drug candidates for targeting GSCs. This is possible using publicly available datasets and online resources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the LINCS Data Portal, and the Connectivity Map (CMap) portal. With such a strategy, Dogra and colleagues identified different potential molecular targets in GBM, including in GSCs, with significant impact on patient survival, and candidate drugs, such as Drospirenone and Eltrombopag (used mainly as a contraceptive drug and to treat thrombocytopenia, respectively), which will need to be experimentally validated for their anti-tumor potential against GSCs [ 62 4. Discussion GBM remains one of the most intractable and lethal human cancers, characterized by high heterogeneity, pronounced therapeutic resistance, and poor clinical outcomes [ 2 136 24 137 66 70 77 79 Nevertheless, BBB penetration remains a significant limitation. Compounds like Clofazimine and Pyrvinium pamoate, although effective against GSCs, display poor CNS bioavailability, necessitating reformulation or novel delivery strategies for clinical translation [ 76 84 The unique metabolic dependencies of GSCs have become a focal point for repurposing. Several identified drugs, including Metformin, Phenformin, Sitagliptin, Fluvoxamine, Chlorpromazine, and antibiotics like Doxycycline or Tigecycline, directly or indirectly target mitochondrial function or glycolysis. This supports the emerging notion that disrupting energy metabolism can selectively affect therapy-resistant GSCs, particularly those relying on OXPHOS [ 63 80 84 85 Notably, in a recent review, Tang et al. (2025) emphasized metabolic rewiring in GSCs, including amino acid metabolism [ 21 Single-agent therapies often fall short due to GBM’s redundancy in survival pathways. Several studies evaluated drug combinations, for instance with TMZ, showing enhanced efficacy or reversal of TMZ resistance. For example, Nicardipine, Phenformin, Chlorpromazine, and Quetiapine sensitized GSCs to TMZ, either by affecting autophagy, promoting apoptosis, or targeting stemness pathways [ 66 68 79 80 69 Tang et al. identified key GSC regulatory pathways, including Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, STAT3-PARN, TFPI2-JNK-STAT3, and endogenous retroviral elements like HML-2 [ 21 77 79 Several limitations affect the comprehensiveness of the literature search, hinder the comparability of the studies, and complicate the evaluation of the translational potential of drug repurposing for targeting GSCs. First, terminological inconsistency may have complicated our systematized search. GSCs are referred to by varied terms like glioma stem cells, stem-like cells, brain tumor-initiating cells, or glioblastoma/glioma-initiating cells. Similarly, terms like “neurospheres”, “spheroids”, and “tumor spheres” are used interchangeably without standard definitions. Establishing minimal criteria for defining GSCs, such as validated stemness marker expression, functional self-renewal capacity in vitro, and tumorigenicity in orthotopic in vivo models, would improve reproducibility and comparability across studies. Second, variable GSC models are used in different studies. Several studies used established GBM cell lines (e.g., U87, LN229, and A172) and/or patient-derived GSCs, with diverse culture conditions and inconsistent validation of stemness, and not all confirmed tumorigenicity in vivo, an essential benchmark for true GSC identity. Furthermore, xenograft models are limited by their lack of immunocompetence, restricting evaluation of drug–immune interactions, which are increasingly recognized as critical in GBM biology. Third, the studies presented heterogeneous experimental designs; that is, xenograft studies varied in mouse strain, implantation site (subcutaneous vs. orthotopic), and drug administration route, affecting translational relevance. Fourth, while we aimed to focus on IDH 1 Importantly, we were able to comprehensively describe and integrate several studies that found the potential of some drugs to be repurposed for GBM treatment, many of them supporting clinical trials. Although several repurposed regimens have been, or are being, evaluated clinically, none have been formally incorporated into standard care. Contributing factors include slow accrual in this relatively uncommon disease, frequent reliance on single-arm studies with historical controls, lack of consistent benefit at diagnosis or relapse, and pharmacokinetic constraints; that is, agents that cross the BBB in other settings may still fail to achieve therapeutic concentrations within GBM tissue [ 128 The intersection of GBM biology with neuroscience, the emerging field of cancer neuroscience, opens new therapeutic avenues. As Tang et al. noted, GSCs exploit neural developmental programs and immune-privileged niches to persist. The recognition that GSCs modulate immune evasion through PD-L1, TFPI2, and other cytokines suggests that repurposed immunomodulatory agents (e.g., Fluvoxamine and Disulfiram) might have dual activity. Moreover, strategies like CAR-T cells targeting GSC-specific antigens (e.g., IL13Rα2 and GRP78) represent a powerful complement to pharmacological repurposing, especially when combined with BBB-permeable agents or metabolic modulators [ 21 Progress in this field will benefit from collaborative efforts that enhance methodological consistency and strengthen translational relevance. This includes the refinement of experimental models that more accurately capture the complexity of human GBM. For example, three-dimensional humanized models based on brain organoids have emerged as valuable translational platforms for studying drug repurposing [ 138 139 Moving forward, advancing drug repurposing research for GSCs will require the adoption of clear and consistent terminology across studies, as well as the promotion of open data sharing to facilitate robust comparative analyses. In addition, closer alignment between preclinical findings and clinical endpoints is essential to bridge the gap between bench and bedside. Incorporation of next-generation omics technologies, AI-driven screening approaches, and microfluidic-based patient-derived models may further accelerate identification and prioritization of the most promising repurposed candidates. Strengthening these foundational aspects while simultaneously incorporating advanced organoid models and mechanistic studies of drug interactions will support a more cohesive research landscape and help to advance promising repurposed candidates toward meaningful clinical impact. 5. Conclusions Drug repurposing offers a promising strategy to accelerate the development of effective therapies for GBM, particularly by targeting GSCs, which play a central role in treatment resistance and tumor recurrence. Evaluation of diverse drug classes, especially CNS-active agents and compounds that modulate cancer metabolism, has revealed several candidates capable of impairing GSC viability, reducing stemness, or enhancing sensitivity to TMZ. Among them, Metformin, Disulfiram, and Chlorpromazine stand out as leading candidates for clinical translation, particularly in rational combinations with TMZ and radiation. Future trials should also consider patient stratification based on GSC-associated molecular signatures to better capture treatment responsiveness. To fully realize the potential of this approach, future progress will depend on the adoption of standardized methodologies, rigorous functional validation of GSC models, and incorporation of emerging molecular insights. Further exploration of less studied signaling pathways and integration of concepts from fields such as cancer neuroscience may reveal novel therapeutic targets. Ultimately, a coordinated, multidisciplinary effort grounded in both preclinical and clinical rigor will be key to translating repurposed drugs into durable and effective treatments for this aggressive disease.
