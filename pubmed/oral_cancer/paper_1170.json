This narrative review critically evaluates the efficacy, safety, and clinical applications of letrozole across diverse infertility contexts. Compared to clomiphene citrate, letrozole is associated with higher ovulation and live birth rates, a lower risk of multiple gestation, and a more favorable endometrial environment. Its pharmacokinetics—marked by transient estrogen suppression and a short half-life—limit embryonic exposure, supporting its favorable safety profile. Emerging data from large, randomized trials and meta-analyses demonstrate no increase in congenital anomalies, miscarriage, or adverse perinatal outcomes in letrozole-conceived pregnancies. Moreover, maternal side effects are generally mild, and the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is low. Letrozole has also shown utility in mild stimulation protocols, fertility preservation for estrogen-sensitive malignancies, and clomiphene-resistant PCOS. Key clinical strategies—such as early-cycle initiation, lowest effective dosing, and individualized monitoring—optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing potential risks. While long-term offspring data remain limited and mechanistic concerns persist, current evidence robustly supports letrozole as a safe and effective option for OI, balancing reproductive success with maternal–fetal safety across a range of infertility indications. letrozole ovulation induction polycystic ovary syndrome clomiphene resistance infertility management ovarian hyperstimulation estrogen-sensitive cancers This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months of regular unprotected intercourse [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Ovulation induction with pharmacotherapy is a cornerstone of infertility treatment for anovulatory women [ 8 9 6 10 6 11 12 13 14 Although letrozole is used off-label for infertility in many countries, early concerns about teratogenicity led to its categorization as a pregnancy category X drug based on its oncological use. Subsequent observational reports and case series suggested a possible association with congenital anomalies, but these were later discredited due to significant methodological flaws, including small sample sizes and lack of comparison groups [ 15 16 16 Over the past decade, large randomized trials and meta-analyses have largely quelled safety concerns, demonstrating no significant increase in birth defects or pregnancy loss associated with letrozole compared to other fertility treatments [ 17 18 19 The aim of this narrative review is to critically evaluate the efficacy of letrozole for ovulation induction, assess its fetal safety profile, and provide clinically relevant guidance for its application in reproductive medicine. Current clinical guidelines and high-quality evidence are synthesized to elucidate the pharmacological mechanisms, therapeutic efficacy, and safety of letrozole across various clinical scenarios, including PCOS, unexplained infertility, combination protocols, and special populations. Data from preclinical models and mechanistic studies concerning potential teratogenic pathways are also examined. Strategies to mitigate risk are outlined, with emphasis on optimizing patient outcomes and minimizing theoretical fetal exposure. This review aims to support evidence-based clinical decision-making regarding the use of letrozole in infertility treatment and to identify areas requiring further investigation. 2. Pharmacology of Letrozole 2.1. Mechanisms of Action Letrozole is a non-steroidal, third-generation aromatase inhibitor that competitively blocks the cytochrome P450 19A1 (CYP19A1) enzyme, preventing conversion of androgens (androstenedione, testosterone) to estrogens (estrone, estradiol) [ 20 21 22 23 Intra-ovarian aromatase inhibition also causes a temporary accumulation of androgens within the follicular microenvironment. These androgens up-regulate FSH-receptor expression and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production in granulosa cells, thereby amplifying follicular sensitivity to FSH and further enhancing folliculogenesis [ 24 25 26 The differential endocrine pathways underlying ovulation induction with letrozole compared to clomiphene citrate are illustrated in Figure 1 2.2. Pharmacokinetics and Dosing for Infertility Letrozole exhibits nearly complete oral bioavailability (≈99.9%) and is well-absorbed following administration. Its mean terminal elimination half-life ranges between 41 and 48 h (approximately 2 days), and steady-state concentrations are typically achieved after one week of daily dosing. Metabolism is primarily hepatic—mainly via CYP2A6 (with lesser roles for CYP3A4)—to inactive metabolites that undergo glucuronidation; approximately 90% of letrozole is excreted in the urine, predominantly as conjugates [ 27 In ovulation induction protocols, letrozole is administered orally at 2.5 mg daily for five days, commonly initiated from cycle day (CD) 3 to CD 5 of a spontaneous or progesterone-induced menses. Ovulation generally occurs around 7–10 days after the final dose. Dose escalation to 5 mg or 7.5 mg daily—while still limited to five days—may be employed in non-responders, though evidence supporting higher dosing remains moderate [ 28 29 30 31 32 2.3. Comparison with Clomiphene and Gonadotropins Letrozole differs pharmacologically and clinically from both clomiphene citrate and injectable gonadotropins (FSH ± LH). Clomiphene has a long half-life with active metabolites that persist for weeks, often inducing anti-estrogenic carry-over effects into subsequent cycles. In contrast, letrozole’s shorter half-life (~2 days) allows each treatment cycle to remain hormonally independent [ 17 Importantly, letrozole does not antagonize estrogen receptors in peripheral tissues, while sparing endometrial development. Randomized controlled trials in women with PCOS have demonstrated significantly greater endometrial thickness with letrozole (mean ~9.16 mm) compared to clomiphene (~4.46 mm), along with improved uterine blood flow [ 33 34 Clinically, letrozole increases monofollicular ovulation rates, demonstrates superior efficacy in clomiphene-resistant PCOS populations [ 35 36 37 Gonadotropins remain the most potent ovulation-induction modality—achieving pregnancy rates of 15–30% per cycle—but carry significant risks: high rates of multifollicular development, multiple gestation, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), necessitating intensive monitoring [ 38 39 Letrozole exhibits distinct pharmacological properties and clinical characteristics when compared with clomiphene citrate and injectable gonadotropin preparations (FSH ± LH), as summarized in Table 1 3. Clinical Effectiveness of Letrozole in Ovulation Induction Letrozole is now the preferred first-line oral agent for ovulation induction in many infertility practices, reflecting the robust evidence supporting its use. Its efficacy has been evaluated across various patient populations and in comparison with alternative therapies. Guidelines now reflect these findings: the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline for PCOS recommends letrozole as first-line pharmacologic therapy for anovulatory infertility [ 6 2 40 Unexplained infertility is often managed with empiric ovarian stimulation combined with IUI, and letrozole has emerged as an effective and safer alternative to clomiphene in this context. In the NICHD network trial (Diamond et al., 2015), live-birth rates after up to four IUI cycles were similar between letrozole (18.7%) and clomiphene (23.3%), yet multiple-gestation rates were much lower with letrozole (13% vs. 32% for gonadotropins) [ 8 41 42 Combining letrozole with other agents expands its clinical utility, particularly in complex or high-risk cases such as estrogen-sensitive malignancies. In such contexts, co-treatment with letrozole during controlled ovarian stimulation—commonly referred to as COST-LE (Controlled Ovarian Stimulation with Letrozole)—has been shown to lower peak estradiol levels by approximately 70% without compromising oocyte yield [ 43 44 45 n 46 47 Dose extension and resistance management strategies are essential when patients fail to ovulate on standard letrozole regimens, and several approaches have been developed to address this challenge. One commonly used method is extending the duration of letrozole administration to 7–10 days, which can overcome resistance in many non-responders. A 2024 randomized controlled trial comparing a 7-day versus a conventional 5-day regimen showed ovulation rates of 90% versus 80%, respectively (not statistically significant), with similar pregnancy outcomes—supporting the use of extended dosing before increasing the daily dose [ 48 49 6 4. Fetal and Maternal Safety Profile Letrozole’s safety in the context of infertility treatment has been examined through preclinical studies and extensive clinical data. Early concerns prompted by animal findings and isolated reports have given way to a robust body of evidence supporting a favorable fetal and maternal safety profile. Below, we review the key evidence on preclinical teratogenicity, human congenital anomaly risk, neonatal outcomes, and maternal adverse events including ovarian hyperstimulation considerations. 4.1. Preclinical Data Initial animal studies raised theoretical safety concerns. In pregnant rats, letrozole exposure during organogenesis led to dose-dependent increases in post-implantation loss and fetal malformations [ 50 51 52 53 53 13 In summary, while animal models indicated possible skeletal malformations and placental abnormalities from letrozole, these preclinical signals necessitated careful monitoring but did not conclusively predict human risk. The early animal data prompted caution and further investigation into letrozole’s safety in human pregnancy, as discussed below. 4.2. Congenital Anomalies in Humans Initial case reports and a non-peer-reviewed study in the mid-2000s raised alarm about possible congenital cardiac defects in letrozole-exposed pregnancies, leading some regulators to temporarily contraindicate letrozole in women of childbearing age [ 54 13 19 p 19 Pundir et al. (2021) conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the reproductive safety of letrozole. In their meta-analysis of 46 studies including 4697 letrozole-associated pregnancies, the overall rate of congenital malformations in infants conceived with letrozole was 2.15%, which is comparable to background rates [ 17 17 17 17 17 Overall, the high-quality evidence now available provides reassurance that letrozole does not increase the incidence of congenital anomalies or spontaneous pregnancy loss in humans [ 17 17 4.3. Neonatal and Perinatal Outcomes Beyond congenital anomalies, the perinatal outcomes of letrozole-associated pregnancies have been extensively studied to identify any subtler risks to newborns. Key outcomes such as birth weight, gestational age at delivery, and neonatal health indicators (e.g., Apgar scores and neonatal complications) appear to be similar between letrozole and other fertility treatments. For example, a recent cohort study in China compared 194 singleton births from letrozole ovulation induction to 154 from non-letrozole treatments and found no adverse differences in birth outcomes [ 19 19 19 13 13 p 55 40 19 4.4. Maternal Adverse Events and OHSS Risk Mitigation From the maternal standpoint, letrozole is generally well tolerated and offers certain safety advantages over alternative ovulation induction therapies. Its pharmacologic profile—a short-acting aromatase inhibitor—confers a relatively mild side-effect burden. Clinical trials have noted that letrozole’s side-effect profile is favorable when compared to clomiphene. In the largest randomized trial in polycystic ovary syndrome, clomiphene was associated with significantly more frequent vasomotor symptoms (notably hot flushes), whereas letrozole users reported slightly higher rates of mild fatigue and dizziness [ 40 40 40 40 56 57 17 Another critical maternal safety consideration in infertility therapy is the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Letrozole-based regimens inherently carry a low risk of OHSS because they stimulate recruitment of only one or a few follicles and keep peak estradiol concentrations well below the thresholds typically reached with gonadotropins [ 58 39 In controlled ovarian-stimulation (COS) protocols for high-risk patients—particularly women with PCOS who exhibit high antral-follicle counts or very high serum AMH—letrozole has been evaluated as an adjunct to mitigate hyper-response. Co-administration of letrozole with a GnRH-antagonist protocol significantly reduced the incidence of moderate–severe early-onset OHSS and lowered total estradiol exposure [ 59 60 61 59 61 Crucially, these estradiol-sparing effects were achieved without compromising key efficacy outcomes—pregnancy rates, endometrial thickness, embryo yield, and live-birth rates remained equivalent to standard COS protocols [ 62 63 64 Thus, although careful cycle monitoring is still mandatory, letrozole—used either as a sole oral agent for anovulatory infertility or as an adjuvant in high-responder IVF cycles—provides an effective strategy to temper OHSS risk. Together with its very low multiple-pregnancy rate and mild side-effect profile, these data support the view that letrozole is a safe, first-line option for ovulation induction from a maternal standpoint. 5. Mechanistic Insights into Potential Teratogenicity Despite robust clinical data supporting the fetal safety of letrozole, initial concerns regarding its potential teratogenicity stemmed from mechanistic hypotheses related to the critical role of estrogens in early embryonic development. Estrogens are essential regulators of key developmental processes, including tissue differentiation, angiogenesis, and organogenesis during the earliest stages of pregnancy [ 65 66 The theoretical concern that letrozole might exert teratogenic effects has been primarily linked to its potential to cause estrogen deprivation during the critical window of organogenesis. Between weeks 3 and 8 post-fertilization, a finely regulated estrogenic milieu is essential for the normal development of key embryonic structures, including the neural tube, heart, and limb buds [ 65 52 53 22 32 52 17 67 Another mechanistic concern related to potential teratogenicity involves placental aromatase suppression during early gestation. The human placenta exhibits increasing aromatase (CYP19A1) activity beginning in the late first trimester, playing a critical role in the local conversion of androgens to estrogens [ 68 53 67 A more speculative yet important area of investigation concerns epigenetic and genomic alterations potentially induced by transient hormonal perturbations during gametogenesis or early embryogenesis. Although assisted reproductive technologies (ART) as a whole have been associated with subtle epigenetic changes, such as altered DNA methylation patterns at imprinted loci [ 69 67 Taken together, these mechanistic pathways—estrogen deprivation during organogenesis, transient placental aromatase inhibition, and theoretical epigenetic modulation—offer plausible explanations for the early safety concerns associated with letrozole use in fertility treatment. However, the convergence of mechanistic safeguards (short duration, early-cycle timing, low dosage) with consistently reassuring clinical data has largely dispelled these concerns, supporting letrozole’s safety profile in ovulation induction. 6. Risk Mitigation Strategies and Clinical Recommendations Optimal safety with letrozole relies on administering the drug only in the early follicular phase, at the lowest effective dose, with appropriate ultrasound/hormonal monitoring and patient-specific protocol adjustments. Contemporary guidelines and multiple clinical trials confirm that, when these principles are followed, letrozole provides excellent efficacy with minimal maternal or fetal risk. Optimal timing of administration: Letrozole should be started on cycle day 2–3 and limited to a 5 (occasionally 7)-day course so that treatment finishes by about cycle day 7–9; with a terminal plasma half-life of ~45 h, drug levels are negligible by the time of ovulation, thereby minimizing embryonic exposure [ 22 Randomized and retrospective studies comparing start days (CD 3 vs. 5) demonstrate equivalent or superior pregnancy rates when letrozole is confined to the earliest follicular days, supporting this timing strategy [ 70 Use the lowest effective dose: Most anovulatory women ovulate on 2.5 mg daily for five days; higher doses (5–7.5 mg) yield more follicles but not consistently higher live-birth rates and may slightly increase multiple-pregnancy risk [ 71 72 73 Ultrasound and hormonal monitoring: Mid-cycle transvaginal ultrasound (≈CD 12) confirms response, helps time intercourse/IUI, and detects rare over-response (>2 mature follicles) that would increase multiple-gestation risk [ 74 74 75 Personalization of protocol: Personalized protocol adaptation is essential to optimize letrozole efficacy and minimize risks across different clinical subgroups. In women with PCOS, current international guidelines recommend lifestyle optimization—including a modest weight loss of 5–10% in those with a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m 2 6 76 For patients with high ovarian reserve or those at elevated risk of hyper-response—such as individuals with numerous antral follicles—treatment should commence with the lowest effective letrozole dose (typically 2.5 mg daily) to minimize the risk of multifollicular development, with cautious escalation only if anovulation persists [ 20 28 77 Letrozole also plays a critical role in fertility preservation protocols for patients with estrogen-sensitive malignancies, particularly breast cancer. In this setting, co-treatment protocols incorporating letrozole during controlled ovarian stimulation have been shown to significantly attenuate peak estradiol levels while preserving oocyte yield. Importantly, the use of such protocols in breast cancer survivors has not been associated with an increased risk of cancer recurrence, and is therefore widely adopted in oncofertility practice [ 78 79 Counseling and informed consent: Letrozole for infertility remains off-label in many jurisdictions; informed consent should summarize large randomized evidence showing higher live-birth and lower twin rates versus clomiphene (27.5% vs. 19.1% live-birth; 3.4% vs. 7.4% twins) [ 40 39 71 72 Adjunctive precautions: Progesterone luteal support can be considered in women with prior luteal-phase deficiency, though not mandatory for standard oral cycles [ 75 22 7. Knowledge Gaps and Future Directions Despite significant advances in our understanding of letrozole’s role in infertility treatment, several knowledge gaps persist and opportunities for further research remain. Large multicenter prospective studies are still needed. Most randomized trials to date focus on PCOS or single-center cohorts; systematic reviews repeatedly note that rare outcomes can only be conclusively assessed by much larger registries [ 17 80 Long-term offspring follow-up is limited. Nearly all studies stop at birth or early infancy. The only published pregnancy-registry follow-up to 3 years reported normal growth and cognitive development in letrozole-conceived children versus clomiphene/gonadotropin controls, but adolescence and adult reproductive health remain unstudied [ 81 Epigenetic and genomic effects require deeper exploration. Reviews of ART highlight potential imprinting and DNA-methylation changes after assisted conception, yet letrozole-specific data are scarce [ 69 82 Real-world data and registries can complement RCTs. Retrospective population-based cohorts from China and Europe already suggest no excess neonatal morbidity with letrozole [ 19 Unanswered clinical questions persist. For example: - Managing non-responders: Extended 7- or 10- day regimens rescue ovulation in up to 90% of letrozole-resistant PCOS patients, but comparative trials versus immediate gonadotropin step-up are lacking [ 73 - Dose and duration optimization: Recent comparative work in 2024 confirmed better follicular recruitment with higher starting doses or extended courses, but robust live-birth data are still lacking [ 30 - Upper age limits: Evidence is sparse on whether women ≥ 40 years benefit meaningfully from oral letrozole versus expedited IVF; pragmatic trials stratified by age and ovarian reserve could guide practice. - Combination regimens: Meta-analyses call for studies on low-dose letrozole combined with other oral agents or mild FSH to enhance unexplained infertility outcomes without increasing multiples [ 62 - Patient-reported outcomes: Quality-of-life and treatment-burden data comparing letrozole with clomiphene or injectables are scarce; dedicated PRO instruments should be incorporated into future trials [ 83 8. Conclusions The evidence reviewed confirms that letrozole occupies a uniquely favorable position at the intersection of clinical efficacy and fetal–maternal safety for ovulation induction. Robust randomized trials demonstrate that, compared with clomiphene citrate, letrozole yields higher ovulation, pregnancy, and live-birth rates—particularly in anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome—while at the same time reducing the incidence of multiple gestation and avoiding the anti-estrogenic endometrial effects seen with selective estrogen-receptor modulators. Mechanistically, its brief, early-cycle aromatase inhibition induces a physiologic, monofollicular response and is largely cleared before the critical window of human organogenesis, a pharmacokinetic profile that underpins its reassuring fetal safety record. Extensive meta-analyses and large cohort studies now show no increase in congenital anomalies, miscarriage, or adverse perinatal outcomes relative to alternative therapies or natural conception, and maternal adverse events are generally mild and transient. When used according to guideline-endorsed principles—early follicular timing, lowest effective dose, ultrasound monitoring, and individualized protocols—letrozole offers a highly favorable benefit–risk profile across diverse infertility scenarios, including unexplained infertility, mild stimulation protocols, and fertility preservation for estrogen-sensitive cancers. Continued vigilance remains essential. Large multicenter registries and long-term follow-up of offspring will further clarify rare outcomes, potential epigenetic effects, and optimal management of letrozole-resistant cases, while real-world data can refine cost-effectiveness and patient-reported experience. Nonetheless, the current totality of evidence supports letrozole as the preferred first-line oral agent for ovulation induction and as a versatile adjunct in assisted-reproduction protocols, aligning effective fertility care with the paramount goals of maternal and fetal safety.

( A B https://BioRender.com/57b481f biomedicines-13-02051-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Comparison of ovulation induction agents (letrozole vs. clomiphene vs. gonadotropins vs. gonadotropins (FSH ± LH)). Aspect Letrozole (Aromatase Inhibitor) Clomiphene Citrate (SERM) Gonadotropins (FSH ± LH) Mechanism Inhibits aromatase → lowers estrogen → releases GnRH/FSH from negative feedback. Stimulates endogenous FSH surge for follicle development. Blocks estrogen receptors in hypothalamus/pituitary → perceived hypoestrogenic state → increased GnRH/FSH. Also binds peripheral receptors (anti-estrogen effect on endometrium, cervix). Direct ovarian stimulation with exogenous FSH (±LH), bypassing the hypothalamus. Higher likelihood of multifollicular recruitment without careful dose titration. Typical Regimen An amount of 2.5–7.5 mg orally and daily for 5 days (e.g., CD 3–7). Can extend to 7–10 days if no response. Off-label use for OI. An amount of 50–150 mg oral daily for 5 days (CD 3–7). Max ~6 cycles recommended. FDA-approved for OI. Daily subcutaneous injections (~75–150 IU FSH) for ~10–14 days with ultrasound monitoring. Often combined with hCG trigger; used with IUI/IVF. Ovulation Rate In total, ~60–80% in anovulatory PCOS (higher than clomiphene in RCTs). Many CC-resistant patients will ovulate on letrozole. In total, ~50–70% in anovulatory PCOS (lower in clomiphene-resistant cases). Diminished efficacy in obese PCOS. In total, >80–90% with adequate dosing (nearly all will ovulate given sufficient stimulation). Risk of multifollicular ovulation rises with higher doses. Live Birth/Success Higher cumulative live birth rate in PCOS vs. clomiphene (27.5% vs. 19.1% over up to 5 cycles). Comparable pregnancy rates to clomiphene in unexplained infertility. Often used before moving to IVF. Proven efficacy for decades; ~15–20% live birth over ~6 cycles in PCOS, but inferior to letrozole in recent trials. Historically first-line in unexplained infertility (now often replaced by letrozole). Per-cycle live-birth is context-dependent:• IUI: ~10–15%• Controlled ovarian stimulation + IUI (unexplained): up to ~30%• IVF: live-birth per transfer ~30–50%; risk of multiples mitigated with single-embryo transfer. Multiple In total, ~3–5% (mostly twins). Lowest risk among OI agents due to monofollicular tendency. High-order multiples (≥triplets) are rare. In total, ~5–8% (mostly twins). Higher than letrozole, as clomiphene often yields 2–3 follicles. Triplets uncommon but have been reported. Highest if multiple follicles are inseminated:• IUI twin rates ~20% when many follicles develop• Significant risk of higher-order multiples without careful cancelation criteria• In IVF, risk is controllable via single-embryo transfer. Endometrial Effect Neutral or positive—does not deplete estrogen receptors. Endometrium usually remains receptive (adequate thickness). Implantation rates in letrozole cycles are favorable. Negative—estrogen receptor down-regulation can thin endometrium and reduce cervical mucus quality. This can lower implantation despite ovulation success. Typically positive (supraphysiologic E2 thickens endometrium); however, very high E2 (e.g., in OHSS) may impair receptivity; luteal support often required if GnRH-agonist trigger is used. Side Effects Mild and related to estrogen drop: reversible fatigue, dizziness, headaches in ~5–10%. Hot flashes less common. Menopausal-type side effects: hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, breast tenderness. In total, ~1–2% report visual blurring or scotomata. Bloating, injection-site discomfort, mood changes. Primary concern: OHSS in over-responders; requires preventive monitoring and cycle adjustments. Monitoring Ultrasound monitoring recommended for safety, but in low-resource settings sometimes minimal monitoring is performed. Very inexpensive per pill. Ultrasound monitoring improves safety (to check follicle number/size). Low cost per pill. High medication and monitoring costs.
