Summary The current generation of highly successful atherosclerosis treatments, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduction, blood pressure management, and smoking cessation, has largely focused on ameliorating factors perceived to drive incident disease and its complications. The adverse contributions of these factors have typically been identified through epidemiological studies. The therapeutic strategies that arose in response focused on risk factors for disease development Graphical abstract Choudhury et al. explore next-generation atherosclerosis therapies. They identify a shifting focus from risk factor management alone to patient-specific, mechanistically informed treatments. Leveraging advanced technologies (cell therapies, monoclonal antibodies, siRNA, mRNA, and gene editing), emerging approaches intend to reverse or regress established disease and incorporate systems-level interventions beyond the atherosclerotic plaque.

Processes of atherogenesis are rehearsed in detail elsewhere. 1 , 2 3 Activated T helper 1 (Th1) lymphocytes produce interferon (IFN)-γ, which activates macrophages and exacerbates atherosclerosis. Other cell types generate protective mediators: T helper 2 (Th2) lymphocytes release the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and regulatory T (Treg) cells produce transforming growth factor β. 4 5 5 6 Figure 1 Figure 1 Processes driving atherosclerosis and opportunities for therapeutic intervention In the top left, the arterial wall is shown, highlighting the recruitment of immune cells such as monocytes and their differentiation into macrophage foam cells, along with the activation of T helper (Th) cells and B cells. Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) expression and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), contribute to the propagation of vascular inflammation. This section highlights where processes of inflammation can be targeted by interventions to ameliorate disease progression TET2 DNMT3A Over the past 30 years, there has been a growing appreciation of “inflammation” as an important factor in atherogenesis and its complications. 7 8 A deeper understanding of plaque biology has been powerfully advanced by contemporary techniques, not least RNA sequencing. Unsupervised analyses of bulk sequencing of human carotid plaques at scale have suggested a new transcriptome-based functional categorization, 9 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 13 14 15 Analysis and interpretation of large, complex “-omics” datasets will be deepened and accelerated by expanding shared data repositories and tools to uncover cellular function and characteristics, 16 17 , 18 19 tissues processes individual patients Here, we will review novel approaches to well-established clinical risk factors, e.g., through LDL-cholesterol reduction and will attempt to provide a contemporary context for a next generation of approaches, some of which extend far beyond the atherosclerotic plaque and draw in systems-level drivers of disease and opportunities for new classes of therapeutic intervention. Novel approaches to LDL reduction The central role for intensive LDL-cholesterol reduction in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is firmly established and accepted. Knowledge of the pathways that govern hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL receptor activity has allowed them to be effectively manipulated, by interventions targeting multiple points. In addition to HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins) and bempedoic acid, 20 21 , 22 23 Especially for statins, a large body of clinical evidence demonstrates efficacy and safety and suitability for long-term use. 24 25 A radical proof-of-principal approach has demonstrated that CRISPR base editing, delivered in vivo 26 in vivo 27 28 While LDL cholesterol has been effectively targeted, lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is genetically determined and confers cardiovascular risk but without currently available approved specific therapies. 29 , 30 , 31 32 33 34 , 35 36 Although treatment of LDL cholesterol has made substantial clinical impact, it is important to recognize that populations at risk do not remain static. The risk factor landscape and therapeutic backdrop has changed substantially in recent decades. In many parts of the world, the population is aging, the prevalence of smoking has diminished, while obesity, sedentary lifestyle and type 2 diabetes are increasing. Approaches to risk management should incorporate an additional reality that a high proportion of individuals are (or could be) already receiving effective disease-modifying therapies. The opportunities to further reduce cardiovascular risk by conventional interventions (e.g., by reducing LDL cholesterol to ever lower levels) are receding. In meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials, Ridker and colleagues have recently shown that, among patients receiving contemporary statins, with effective LDL-cholesterol reduction, inflammation assessed by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was a stronger predictor for risk of future cardiovascular events and death than LDL cholesterol. These data fall into a broader landscape that identifies a role of inflammation as a target for reducing risk in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We have argued before that a shift in emphasis toward the consideration of processes inflammation 8 Processes of inflammation It is over 30 years since markers of systemic inflammation (measured by the acute-phase proteins: C-reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A) were associated with adverse outcomes, initially in patients with acute coronary syndromes 37 38 39 40 41 As discussed in greater detail, in the following sections, the functional status of cells within and beyond the plaque is sensitive to a complex network of regulatory factors, including genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental cues from cytokines, DAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, interactions with reactive oxygen species, matrix components, and metabolites. Understanding their roles and interactions is opening new possibilities for therapeutic interventions. Treating inflammation Treatments of inflammation have reported benefit in the context of established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT) was a placebo-controlled trial of colchicine 0.5 mg daily in patients who had recently had an MI. The primary major adverse cardiac event (MACE) endpoint occurred in 5.5% of the patients in the colchicine group, as compared with 7.1% in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77; p 42 p 43 n . n 44 . 45 46 In part, clinical judgments around colchicine are hindered because the relevant mechanisms of its action remain unresolved. Colchicine functions as a microtubule disrupter with anti-inflammatory effects 47 , 48 , 49 50 , 51 , 52 53 , 54 50 , 55 56 The Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) trial recruited patients with prior MI and elevated hsCRP. 57 p p p p 58 p p p p 59 While the relative absolute . 60 Mendelian randomization studies examining the effects of genetically determined CRP show that it does not have a casual role in coronary heart disease. 61 62 63 64 Cellular reprogramming-immunomodulatory therapies Cellular processes within the plaque are complex and dynamic. 5 65 Macrophages are a key cell type in atherosclerosis, occupy a range of functional states and, can alter their properties and behavior in response to the local chemokine/cytokine environment, 66 12 66 67 −/− 68 69 , 70 The immune system also has endogenous 71 −/− p 72 Accordingly, there is a rationale to enhance the activity of the Treg population. Aldesleukin (recombinant IL-2) caused an enrichment of Tregs, without causing T effector activation, and was not associated with adverse effects in a small phase 1b/2a clinical trial. 73 74 An alternative approach is to administer IL-4 and/or IL-13 (which are physiologically produced by Th2 cells to induce alternative macrophage activation), which results in anti-inflammatory and tissue repair capacities. 75 −/− in vivo 76 77 There is also an expanding literature on the contributions of B lymphocytes in atherosclerosis based on clinical observations, studies in mouse models, and in vitro 78 79 Sequencing over 1,700 B cells from mice with atherosclerosis and control mice revealed 56 antibodies from expanded B cell clones in atherosclerosis. About one-third targeted atherosclerotic plaques, indicating diverse lesion antigens, trigger responses. Proteomics identified ALDH4A1, a mitochondrial enzyme, as a target of antibody A12. Injection of A12 antibody in mice reduced plaque growth and LDL levels, highlighting its possible therapeutic role in cardiovascular disease. 80 In a small phase 2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04776629 81 NCT06927739 Overall, there is increasing interest in B cell-based therapeutics for atherosclerosis, including the antibody administration already noted, but also a vaccine approach and the adaptation of a multiplicity of strategies used in treating autoimmune diseases, and lymphoid cancers. Cellular reprogramming-atherosclerosis regression Clinical trials have evaluated the effects of drug interventions on atherosclerosis regression. In ASTEROID, an early observational study, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) demonstrated a 6.1% reduction in total atheroma volume at 24 months in 507 patients taking 40 mg rosuvastatin daily. 82 83 p 84 85 Progression or persistence of atherosclerosis is a manifestation not only of pro-atherogenic processes but also of the failure to remove inflammatory and necrotic material, including through dysfunctional efferocytosis. Identification of the factors that determine cellular function and failed inflammation resolution offers possibilities for reprogramming and fundamental lesion remodeling. 86 , 87 87 88 89 90 75 76 To date, clinical interventions have not targeted specifically the pathways and processes of atherosclerosis regression, but awareness of the resolution of atherosclerosis, distinct from retarded progression, and knowledge of its regulation will bring forward the possibility to harness endogenous repair processes and to treat established lesions.

By combining small numbers of markers, relatively superficial inferences were made about potential function. The advent of single-cell sequencing, particularly combined with spatial data, provides hugely greater functional information and, potentially, insight. 13 , 91 , 92 in vivo 93 , 94 95 13 96 omic Considerations in diabetes Globally, approximately half a billion people have diabetes. 97 98 99 100 , 101 , 102 , 103 104 100 , 105 , 106 107 Elevated blood glucose drives vascular complications, 108 109 110 110 , 111 , 112 , 113 , 114 115 We have reasoned that these “legacy effects” might be “recorded” in a cell type with (1) unusually long persistence, (2) agency in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, and (3) evidence of relevant modifiable programming. Elevated glucose reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) culminating in distinct chromatin modifications (e.g., histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation) in HSCs and their macrophage progeny. 116 , 117 , 118 in vivo 116 118 , 119 , 120 , 121 , 122 123 , 124 125 , 126 , 127 116 Clonal hematopoiesis in atherosclerosis Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has emerged as a novel and substantial age-associated risk factor for atherosclerosis. Work to elucidate the etiology is ongoing (see the following text) but promises to offer an attractive avenue for targeted therapeutic intervention at a large scale. CHIP is defined as the acquisition of a somatic mutation of a known hematological driver gene, identified in peripheral blood cells. 128 , 129 130 131 Initial work by Jaiswal et al. demonstrated the association of CHIP with a 1.4-fold increased risk of death, unaccounted for by the increased risk of hematological malignancy. 132 133 The majority of CHIP involves a single mutation, and 80% of cases involve mutations in the epigenetic regulator genes ASXL1 TET2 DNMT3A 130 , 134 JAK2 ASXL1 TET2 133 DNMT3A Translational work has uncovered the role of dysregulated inflammation in CHIP-associated atherosclerosis. Transplantation of TET2 LDLR −/− 135 JAK2 136 ASXL1 137 Understanding the sequence of events in the development of atherosclerosis among individuals with CHIP is pivotal in determining whether CHIP is causative, or merely a biomarker, in atherosclerosis. HPSCs remain largely dormant but exit quiescence in response to physiological stress—a process that provokes DNA damage. 138 139 116 Recent work from Díez-Díez et al. sought to assess the temporal development of CHIP and femoral atherosclerosis measured with ultrasound. 140 Notwithstanding the complexities of large-scale genetic screening, clinicians must consider what future preventative intervention for CHIP-associated atherosclerosis might look like. To date, much of the discussion has centered around targeting inflammatory pathways. In the CANTOS trial, the use of canakinumab to induce IL-1β blockade showed a signal toward benefit among patients with TET2 141 142 TET2 TET2 143 It remains to be seen what effect such therapies might have on the development of atherosclerosis in humans with CHIP. The ultimate therapy might instead be one aimed at eradicating the mutant HSPC clone, rather than one aimed at mitigating its effect. JAK2 More work is required to fully understand the relationship between the mutant CHIP clone and atherogenesis. Collaboration between cardiology and hematology clinicians and scientists has been essential to the progress so far and will likewise be instrumental in implementing future clinical interventions. Conclusion and future prospects Emerging from many of the interlinking strands surveyed earlier is a complex systems biology in which atherosclerosis reflects disordered local and systemic processes of homeostasis, which are intimately entwined in the fabric of “metabolism” and inflammation. Data are emerging on further specific neural interconnections in relation to immune function, 144 145 146 147 148 , 149 The future of atherosclerosis treatment is poised to benefit from a range of emerging technologies, offering innovative and personalized approaches. RNA-based therapeutics, such as siRNA therapies like inclisiran, are a rapidly advancing treatment option by targeting specific genes, such as PCSK9, with infrequent dosing. Similarly, antisense oligonucleotides targeting apolipoprotein C3 or Lp(a) are being explored to manage lipid profiles, while mRNA therapies hold promise for enhancing the expression of beneficial proteins to promote vascular health. Immunomodulatory approaches are also advancing. Beyond existing treatments such as colchicine and canakinumab, targeted anti-inflammatory agents are being developed to modulate the immune response and reprogram processes of inflammation. Vaccines targeting oxidized LDL and other atherosclerosis-specific antigens, as well as Treg modulation, are being investigated to maintain a balanced immune response, reducing pathological inflammation. Advanced drug delivery systems are enabling more precise therapies. Nanomedicine platforms are being designed to deliver drugs directly to atherosclerotic plaques, with plaque-specific targeting using antibodies against macrophage markers or neovascular components. Looking further ahead, opportunities are already emerging in proof of concept for CRISPR-based gene editing and epigenetic reprogramming and for interventions that capitalize on expanded appreciation of the roles of circadian rhythm, sleep, stress, diet, gut microbiota, and in utero Acknowledgments R.P.C. and J.C. are funded by the BHF-MRC Centre of Research Excellence in Advanced Therapeutics MR/Z504865/1 SI/F/24/21170016 MeRIAD Novo Nordisk Foundation 10.13039/100000002 NIH HL084312 HL131481 HL151328 Bristol Myers Squibb Declaration of interests R.P.C. is the UK Chief Investigator for the ZEUS trial (sponsor Novo Nordisk) and serves on the Global Expert Panel for that trial.
