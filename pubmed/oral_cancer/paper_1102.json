The practice of radiotherapy (RT) is shifting worldwide from 3-dimensional conformal RT to modern RT techniques for LAPC, but there is insufficient evidence whether these advanced RT techniques would translate into better treatment outcomes. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on modern RT techniques for LAPC. Modern RT techniques for LAPC show favorable survival outcomes and low toxicity rates, compared with historical data. Considering modern RT techniques showed similar efficacy, the optimal RT technique is individually selected according to clinical practice and resource availability.

Introduction Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies globally, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of <12% [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Theoretically, combining radiotherapy (RT) with chemotherapy could provide local disease control in addition to systemic disease control. However, several phase III randomized trials investigating concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) using two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT) for LAPC have reported conflicting results regarding OS, despite demonstrating improved local control in patients treated with CCRT [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 On the other hand, stereotactic body RT (SBRT), a novel RT technique delivering higher doses to the tumor in a few fractions, has been applied for LAPC and several prospective and retrospective studies have recently reported promising results [ 13 14 15 Globally, the practice of RT is transitioning from 3DCRT to modern RT techniques, including IMRT, SBRT, and PBT, across all cancers, but there is insufficient evidence whether these advanced RT techniques would translate into better treatment outcomes [ 16 17 2. Methods and Materials This systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines ( Supplementary Table S1 18 2.1. Search Strategy The search strategy was developed by all authors in consultation with a professional librarian at Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, Bucheon. Specific keywords were identified using the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) model ( Supplementary Table S2 2.2. Selection Criteria Only studies evaluating the treatment outcomes of modern RT techniques including IMRT, SBRT, and PBT to treat LAPC for radical intent were included. LAPC has several definitions, but we defined it as non-metastasized and unresectable pancreatic cancer. For this study, we defined SBRT as delivering ≥5 gray (Gy) per fraction in ≤6 fractions. Eligible studies were prospective or retrospective in design, included ≥10 patients, and reported at least one relevant endpoint, such as survivals and/or toxicities. When overlapping patient populations were present, the study with the largest sample size was selected. However, studies from the same institution were independently included if they were reported in distinct periods or with individual outcomes. The following were excluded: studies involving pediatric patients, studies evaluating patients with recurrent disease or distant metastases, and studies involving patients with a history of prior RT. 2.3. Data Extraction Relevant data were independently extracted by two authors, focusing on patient demographics, treatment characteristics, survivals, and toxicities. The main outcomes focused on efficacy, including local progression-free survival (LPFS), PFS, OS, as well as safety, which included acute and late severe toxicities. Survival rates were obtained at 1-, 2-, and 3-year intervals after the start of initial treatment. In cases where data were presented only graphically, survival outcomes were estimated indirectly from descriptive plots. Severe toxicity was mainly defined by crude rates of grade ≥ 3 toxicity by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale. Specific toxicity endpoints included acute hematologic toxicity (HT) and gastrointestinal toxicity (GIT) during RT, as well as late GIT following RT. 2.4. Quality Assessment The quality assessment of non-randomized studies, including case-control and cohort studies, was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [ 19 2.5. Statistical Analysis Meta-analysis was conducted using the DerSimonian–Laird random effects model [ 20 I 2 I 2 21 p p https://rexsoft.org/ 3. Results Initially, a total of 1411 studies, 1323 studies from four databases and 88 studies from additional sources, were identified. After multiple screening, 197 studies were selected for a full-text review and 144 were excluded for the following reason: (1) no treatment outcomes (n = 63); (2) no details on RT techniques (n = 30); (3) overlapping patients from same institution (n = 27); and so on. The PRISMA flow diagram, presented in Figure 1 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 23 33 3.1. Study Characteristics All 53 studies were prospective or retrospective observational studies. The quality of each study assessed using the NOS was medium to high ( Table 1 Supplementary Table S3 Supplementary Table S4 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 3.2. Efficacy Survival outcomes for individual cohorts following treatment initiation are summarized in Table 2 Using random effects analysis, pooled rates for 2-year LPFS, PFS, and OS were 54% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39–69%), 11% (95% CI, 8–16%), and 29% (95% CI, 25–34%), respectively ( Figure 2 Table 3 Supplementary Table S5 10 3.3. Safety Details regarding the overall incidence of severe toxicities during and after RT are presented in Supplementary Table S6 Figure 3 3.4. Publication Bias Funnel plots and of Egger’s regression test results for the included studies are presented in Supplementary Figure S1 4. Discussion The role of RT in treating LAPC is still under debate. Mixed results were reported in several randomized trials comparing CCRT with chemotherapy alone for the treatment of LAPC [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 RT 75 76 77 78 In this study, pooled 1- and 2-year OS rates with modern RT techniques were 71% (95% CI, 66–76%), and 29% (95% CI, 25–34%), respectively. The pooled rates of acute and late GIT ≥ grade 3 were minimal at 0% (95% CI, 0–1%) and 2% (95% CI, 1–4%), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the efficacy and safety of modern RT techniques for unresectable LAPC, aligned with recent changes in clinical practice. In spite of improved systemic control, the local control rate of conventional fractionated RT was insufficient, leading clinicians to change their preference from conventional fractionated CCRT to new RT techniques, i.e., SBRT [ 79 64 80 81 58 3 82 Several studies were conducted to identify the optimal RT scheme for treating LAPC. One meta-analysis, comparing SBRT with conventional fractionated RT using 3DCRT or IMRT from studies published between 2004 and 2016, reported a significant OS benefit for the SBRT group [ 83 84 15 33 NCT03704662 Another tool to improve efficacy is PBT. Pancreatic cancer is considered to be a radioresistant tumor [ 85 86 87 88 65 Traditional treatment strategy for LAPC is CCRT administered over 5–6 weeks, followed by chemotherapy. On the other hand, SBRT is completed quickly within 1–5 fractions, minimizing delays in chemotherapy initiation, and is generally well-tolerated by patients. Several SBRT studies tried new approaches, such as upfront SBRT followed by chemotherapy; however, early distant metastases occurred soon after SBRT in some patients [ 56 63 As approximately 30% of patients with LAPC present occult metastatic disease at diagnosis, ICT can help to select a subgroup of patients without early metastatic progression who can potentially better benefit from RT [ 89 90 91 92 11 3 5 4 93 94 95 Technical advance from 2DRT to 3DCRT requires the change in practices from using solely bony and muscular landmarks to a more complex use of computed tomography-based anatomy to define target volume of the tumor and regional lymph nodes (LN), and results in wide variation in the target delineation across all cancers [ 96 97 98 p 99 100 p The current meta-analysis has some limitations. First, the majority of included studies were retrospective, and no phase III randomized trials compared IMRT, SBRT, and PBT. We indirectly compared modern RT techniques from single-arm studies. The heterogeneity of observational studies and potential selection bias may have affected the pooled analysis [ 101 102 103 Supplementary Table S3 104 Supplementary Table S4 44 46 5. Conclusions From the current systematic review and meta-analysis, modern RT techniques for LAPC show favorable survival outcomes and low toxicity rates, compared with historical data. Between modern RT techniques, IMRT, SBRT, and PBT showed similar efficacy. Since almost all studies have single-arm design, and chemotherapy regimens have changed over time, conclusions must be drawn with caution. Therefore, the use of modern RT techniques is individually selected according to clinical practice and resource availability. Further studies will be needed to better evaluate the optimal RT scheme and find the combination strategy with the modern chemotherapy regimens.
