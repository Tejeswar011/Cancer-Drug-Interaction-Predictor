Cytokines and growth factors play central roles in modulating immune regulation, inflammation, and tissue repair, thereby representing critical biomarkers for the enhancement of diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring. This review provides a comprehensive overview of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as growth factors, emphasizing their pathogenic roles and clinical relevance across various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Key pro-inflammatory cytokines—such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-γ—are examined regarding their contributions to disease progression and activity, alongside anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and IL-4, which regulate immune tolerance and inflammation resolution. Growth factors, such as TGF-β, are analyzed for their dual roles in immune modulation, fibrosis, and tissue remodeling. Cytokine signature profiles employed as diagnostic tools are discussed, together with the need for assay standardization. Advances in multiplex and omics technologies facilitating biomarker discovery are also reviewed. Finally, current and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting cytokines and growth factors, such as anti-TNF agents, IL inhibitors, anti-interferon therapies, and JAK/STAT pathway blockers, are explored. cytokines growth factors autoimmune diseases Regione Campania Fondo di Rotazione 183/1987 This study was supported by Regione Campania Fondo di Rotazione ex L. 183/1987 for the project entitled “LABoratory Innovations for Rare INflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases Treatment—LABIRINT”. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cytokines are soluble proteins essential for coordinating and regulating the differentiation, maturation, and activation of immune cells through a network of interconnected signaling pathways. These proteins, secreted by different types of cells, bind to specific receptors on the surface of target cells to mediate diverse effects on cellular signaling and communication. An imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines reflects immune dysregulation, which can trigger inflammatory responses and lead to tissue and organ damage [ 1 2 3 4 1.1. Rheumatoid Arthritis RA is a chronic autoimmune condition that primarily targets the joints, leading to symptoms such as redness, swelling, and joint pain, and, in severe cases, to restricted mobility. Affecting about 1% of the population, RA is characterized by inflammation of the synovial membrane, which progressively leads to the degradation of cartilage and bone, ultimately resulting in joint deformity and chronic disability. Although the exact cause of RA is unknown, the immunological events occurring in the synovial tissue and synovial fluid have been well documented. Synovial macrophages are a key source of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6, which drive inflammation, activate fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and enhance osteoclastogenesis, which contributes to bone erosion. Once activated, FLSs become aggressive cells capable of producing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade cartilage. Cartilage itself can release proteases in a feedback loop that further exacerbates damage [ 5 6 1.2. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus SLE is a multifaceted inflammatory autoimmune disorder marked by alternating phases of relapse and remission, during which multiple organs and systems can be affected. Key immunological features include the production of autoantibodies and activation of the complement system, resulting in the formation and deposition of immune complexes that contribute to tissue injury and multiorgan involvement. The differentiation and functional development of CD4 + 7 1.3. Psoriatic Arthritis PsA is a heterogeneous, chronic, inflammatory immune-mediated disease characterized by musculoskeletal inflammation (arthritis, enthesitis, spondylitis, and dactylitis). It generally occurs in patients with psoriasis or a family history of psoriasis [ 8 9 10 1.4. Ankylosing Spondylitis AS is a prevalent form of chronic arthritis that primarily affects the axial skeleton (spine and sacroiliac joints) but can also involve peripheral joints like other spondyloarthritides, including psoriatic arthritis. AS is not a classic autoimmune disease: it does not have a female predominance and is not associated with MHC class II alleles, nor does it show significant autoantibodies or clinical response to drugs targeting T or B cells. It is therefore considered a hyperinflammatory disease driven by abnormal innate responses to tissue stress. Pathological features include chronic inflammation (synovitis, enthesitis, and osteitis), focal bone destruction, and pathological bone formation, which can lead to joint ankylosis. About a third of patients also have extra-articular manifestations, such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis), and acute anterior uveitis [ 11 1.5. Systemic Sclerosis Finally, systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease characterized by connective tissue involvement, a complex pathogenesis, and highly variable clinical manifestations. The disease arises from intricate interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers such as chemical exposures and infections. These factors cause endothelial injury, immune activation, and chronic inflammation, leading to the release of cytokines and growth factors like TGF-β that stimulate fibroblast activation and excessive collagen production, driving vascular damage and progressive cutaneous and internal organ fibrosis [ 12 13 1.6. Cytokines and Growth Factors in Autoimmune Diseases Despite their differences in clinical presentation, autoimmune and immunological-mediated disorders share a common underlying cause: immune system dysfunction. Chronic inflammation, abnormal immune cell activation, and overproduction of cytokines and growth factors all contribute to tissue damage and remodeling. Across these illnesses, cytokines and growth factors play critical roles in immunological dysfunction. Their dysregulation not only initiates and maintains inflammation, but it also causes structural alterations in tissues such as bone erosion, fibrosis, and glandular destruction. Understanding these molecular pathways is critical for designing targeted therapeutics capable of breaking the loop of immune-mediated harm and improving patient outcomes. Table 1 2. Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in Autoimmune Diseases 2.1. Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) 2.1.1. TNF-α Protein and Physiological Role TNF-α is a multifunctional cytokine with a broad range of effects on different cell types. It plays a central role in regulating inflammatory responses and has been widely implicated in the development of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Structurally, TNF-α is a homotrimeric protein composed of 157 amino acids and is primarily produced by activated macrophages, T lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Functionally, TNF-α initiates the release of numerous inflammatory mediators, including other cytokines and chemokines. It exists in both a soluble form (sTNF-α) and a transmembrane form (tmTNF-α) [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 2.1.2. TNF-α in Autoimmune Diseases TNF-α plays a central role in the pathogenesis of RA. Its expression is significantly elevated in RA patients, and overexpression of TNF-α in transgenic animal models has been shown to induce autoimmune arthritis [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dysregulation of TNF-α significantly contributes to the tissue damage that characterizes the systemic nature of the disease. TNF-α promotes lymphocyte apoptosis and impairs the clearance of apoptotic cells, leading to defective removal of cellular debris. This defective clearance results in the persistence of apoptotic remnants that expose modified or clustered self-antigens. Such exposure breaks immune tolerance by activating autoreactive lymphocytes, thereby promoting autoantibody production and amplifying autoimmune responses. Furthermore, the clustering of diverse intracellular antigens within apoptotic blebs facilitates a broad autoimmune response [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 TNF-α is also one of the abundant cytokines in inflammation related to SS; it is secreted by activated macrophages and T-cells and contributes to the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines (e.g., IL-8), increasing the influx of other immune cells to the glandular tissue [ 33 34 35 36 TNF-α is also involved in the inflammatory process of AS. At the enthesis site (enthesis), it binds to TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors on endothelial cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts, activating NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. This results in a marked increase in the expression of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6), chemokines, and adhesion molecules (ICAM, VCAM), with a recall of neutrophils and other white blood cells into the joint [ 37 38 39 40 Finally, in systemic sclerosis, TNF-α was found to be elevated in SSc patients, and its higher serum levels, influenced by specific TNFA gene promoter polymorphisms, correlate with an increased risk of cancer in these patients [ 41 42 2.2. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) 2.2.1. IL-1β Protein and Physiological Role IL-1β is a pivotal pro-inflammatory cytokine and a key member of the IL-1 family, a group of 11 cytokines integral to orchestrating immune and inflammatory responses. Renowned for its potent inflammatory activity, IL-1β exerts profound effects on the pathogenesis of several chronic inflammatory systemic diseases such as Atherosclerosis, Metabolic Syndrome, Type 1 Diabetes and RA [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 2.2.2. IL-1β in Autoimmune Diseases In RA, IL-1β is a pivotal mediator in both the initiation and perpetuation of joint inflammation and destruction. Its role extends beyond merely driving inflammation; IL-1β actively contributes to synovial hyperplasia by stimulating fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) to proliferate and produce pro-inflammatory mediators [ 50 51 52 Recent studies have demonstrated increased serum levels of IL-1β in SLE patients, correlating with disease activity and severity [ 53 54 55 56 57 In recent years, IL-1β has received increasing attention for its key role in the pathogenesis of primary Sjögren’s syndrome [ 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 Recent studies have shown that IL-1β gene expression is significantly increased in patients with psoriatic arthritis compared to both healthy subjects and patients with cutaneous psoriasis alone. Notably, a 2022 study reported a more than 22-fold increase in IL-1β expression in PsA patients compared to controls, whereas the increase in patients with only cutaneous psoriasis was much more modest [ 69 70 71 72 IL-1β expression and activity are also elevated in SSc patients. Increased IL-1β levels have been observed in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of SSc patients [ 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 high high high low 75 2.3. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) 2.3.1. IL-6 Protein and Physiological Role IL-6 is a small polypeptide that has a four-helix bundle structure and interacts with a membrane-anchored IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) present on target cells. It is produced by several cell types like B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, mesangial cells, vascular endothelial cells, mast cells, and dendritic cells, and it can be activated by IL-1β and TNF-α [ 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 This cytokine plays a regulatory role in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages by modulating the production of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) [ 84 85 86 2.3.2. IL-6 in Autoimmune Diseases In RA, IL-6 is highly expressed in synovial tissue and fluid, and its levels correlate with synovial inflammation and damage [ 87 88 89 90 + 91 92 93 94 90 95 IL-6 is frequently elevated in serum, saliva, and tears of patients with SS [ 96 97 98 99 In AS, IL-6 is involved in the regulation of inflammation, T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation, and bone metabolism [ 100 101 102 In PsA, IL-6 contributes to the IL-17–driven inflammatory axis. Genetic and environmental triggers (dysbiosis, biomechanical stress) activate innate cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) to release cytokines (IL-12, IFN-α, IL-23, TGF-β, IL-6, IL-1β) that polarize T cells [ 103 104 105 IL-6 serum levels correlate with disease severity features, including digital ulcers, calcinosis, anti-Scl70 antibodies (commonly associated with diffuse SSc), and impaired lung function. IL-6 is also linked with increased cardiovascular risk in SSc patients [ 106 107 108 109 2.4. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) 2.4.1. IL-17 Protein and Physiological Role IL-17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in immune responses, especially at mucosal barriers. The IL-17 family comprises six structurally related cytokines (IL-17A-F), with IL-17A being the most studied and biologically significant member. While IL-17 is well known for its involvement in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, its physiological functions are essential for host defense, tissue repair, and maintenance of barrier integrity [ 110 111 + 112 113 114 2.4.2. IL-17 in Autoimmune Diseases IL-17 is highly abundant in the synovial fluid and tissues of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. It drives inflammation by stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which contribute to tissue degradation [ 115 116 117 118 119 IL-17 shows significantly increased expression in the salivary glands of SS patients, in association with the severity of local inflammation and systemic involvement [ 120 41 121 122 123 124 The onset of inflammation in AS results from a complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that disrupt immune regulation. The most significant genetic link is with the HLA-B27 allele of the MHC-I gene on chromosome 6. Specifically, in spondylitis, the abnormal expression of the HLA-B27 allele may contribute to the disease by binding to cells that express the natural killer receptor KIR3DL2, which recognizes the HLA-B27 homodimer. This interaction triggers the production of IL-17, a cytokine involved in driving inflammation in AS [ 125 126 127 The IL-23/IL-17 axis plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Th17 cells produce the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17 and drive the expression of related molecules such as MMP3, CCL1, CCL20, and IL-6, all of which are significantly upregulated in the blood, synovium, and skin of PsA patients [ 128 129 Finally, SSc patients with detectable IL-17A also showed increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-22 and higher Th17 cell frequency. These patients tend to have reduced lung function and a significantly higher prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) compared to patients without detectable IL-17A. Furthermore, SSc patients with both detectable IL-17A and high IL-6 levels exhibit more pronounced lung impairment and increased PAH prevalence than those with undetectable IL-17A and low IL-6 [ 130 131 2.5. Interferon-Gamma (IFN-γ) 2.5.1. IFN-γ Protein and Physiological Role Interferons (IFNs) are a broadly expressed group of cytokines, classified into type I, II, and III based on the signaling receptors they engage [ 132 133 134 135 136 2.5.2. IFN-γ in Autoimmune Diseases In the early stages of RA, IFN-γ contributes to the initiation and amplification of inflammatory responses [ 137 138 139 140 In SLE, elevated levels of IFN-γ have been associated with disease activity and severity, contributing to the pathogenesis of SLE through the IFNGR1/2-pSTAT1-TBX21 signaling axis, promoting Th1 cell differentiation and activation, as well as B-cell complex formation, thereby exacerbating autoimmune responses [ 141 142 IFN-γ represents, probably, the most highly expressed cytokine in patients with SS [ 143 101 144 145 + 146 147 Several studies have documented a significant increase in IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood of patients with AS compared with healthy controls. The finding suggests that IFN-γ may contribute to the maintenance of the chronic inflammatory state of the disease [ 148 149 IFN-γ plays a complex and dual role in the pathogenesis of PsA, with both therapeutic potential and pro-inflammatory effects observed across studies. IFN-γ induced localized psoriasis at injection sites and failed to normalize inflammatory biomarkers or improve cutaneous manifestations. Mechanistically, IFN-γ drives PsA progression through multiple pathways: elevated IFN-γ+ CD8+ T-cells correlate with disease activity in PsA scores and synovial inflammation. These cells synergize with IL-17A-producing Th17 cells to sustain joint damage; CXCL10 specifically associates with PsA development in psoriasis patients [ 150 151 A large transethnic meta-analysis of GWAS, including 4436 SSc cases and 14, 751 controls, identified a significant association with the SNP rs4134466 in the Blimp-1 gene, which regulates IFN-γ gene expression [ 152 153 3. Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines as Biomarkers in ADs 3.1. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) 3.1.1. IL-10 Protein and Physiological Role IL-10 is a cytokine that plays a key role in regulating immune responses, and it is produced by activated immune cells [ 154 155 156 157 158 159 154 160 161 3.1.2. IL-10 in Autoimmune Diseases In RA, this persistent activation of PRRs leads to continuous release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the autoimmune pathology and joint damage. Regulatory mechanisms, especially involving the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, act to limit this process by suppressing key adaptor molecules like MyD88 and promoting degradation of signaling proteins such as TRAF6 [ 162 163 164 165 Despite its well-established anti-inflammatory properties, the role of IL-10 in SLE remains controversial. While some studies report a positive correlation between IL-10 levels and disease activity or damage indices, others do not support this association [ 166 167 In SS, IL-10 production appears to be impaired: studies in patients and mouse models have found reduced levels of IL-10 and CD4+IL-10+ T cells [ 168 169 170 IL-10 gene promoter polymorphism-1082 A>G (rs1800896) was found to occur more frequently in AS patients, with individuals carrying the A/G or G/G genotypes having about three times higher risk of developing the disease compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, AS patients exhibit elevated serum levels of IL-10, indicating dysregulation of IL-10 production in the disease. These findings suggest that genetic variations in the IL10 gene influence both susceptibilities to AS and the systemic expression of IL-10, which likely affects the modulation of inflammatory and immune responses in AS [ 171 3.2. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) 3.2.1. IL-4 Protein and Its Physiological Role IL-4 is a critical cytokine produced mainly by Th2 cells that regulates B cell differentiation, survival, and memory formation, particularly by modulating germinal center B cells through downregulation of the transcription factor BCL6. This regulation must be precisely balanced, as both excessive and impaired IL-4 signaling can disrupt memory B cell development, leading either to failed differentiation or apoptosis without proper survival signals [ 172 173 174 175 176 177 3.2.2. IL-4 in Autoimmune Diseases Recent research underscores IL-4’s dual role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis and therapeutic potential. A critical function of IL-4 is its suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation, key drivers of RA pathology. For example, IL-4 reduces inflammatory activity by lowering IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels in synovial macrophages and fibroblasts [ 178 179 In the context of SLE, IL-4 plays a critical and supportive role in sustaining the immunosuppressive functions of Treg cells. IL-4 significantly enhances the suppressive activity of Tregs. This is particularly important in SLE, where immune dysregulation is prominent, and Treg dysfunction contributes to the loss of peripheral tolerance and the expansion of autoreactive lymphocytes [ 180 An analysis of cytokine levels in tears from patients with SS showed a significant increase in IL-4 compared with healthy controls and patients with dry eye not associated with SS. These data suggest that IL-4 might contribute to local inflammation and glandular dysfunction in SS [ 181 More insights come from studies in PsA, where emerging evidence positions IL-4 as a disease-modulating cytokine influencing both inflammatory pathways and bone-related immune processes. IL-4 has been identified as a potential PsA-specific biomarker, with strong correlations to genes governing immune regulation and osteoclast differentiation [ 182 183 184 4. Growth Factors as Biomarkers in ADs 4.1. Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) 4.1.1. TGF-β Protein and Physiological Role TGF-β is a key and multifaceted regulator of immune responses, first identified over thirty years ago as a modulator of immune cell function. TGF-β influences both the intensity and nature of immune reactions to microbial threats and plays a crucial role in preserving immune tolerance and maintaining homeostasis in response to self-antigens and harmless environmental antigens under steady-state conditions [ 185 186 187 4.1.2. TGF-β in Autoimmune Diseases In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis [ 188 189 190 In SLE, TGF-β signaling is often impaired. Studies have shown that the expression of TGF-β type I receptor (TGFβRI) is decreased in naïve CD4+ T cells of SLE patients, correlating with disease activity. Elevated levels of IL-6 in SLE patients can downregulate TGFβRI expression through the JAK/STAT3 pathway, further disrupting TGF-β signaling. This impairment may contribute to the loss of immune tolerance and the development of the autoimmunity characteristic of SLE [ 191 A particular relevance to the pathogenesis of AS concerns the interaction between TGF-β and HLA-B27. Studies have shown that HLA-B27 expression alters the TGF-β signaling pathway, involving a physical interaction between HLA-B27 and the TGF-β type I receptor (ALK5). This interaction leads to increased phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, a key molecule in the downstream signal transduction of TGF-β, in B27 rat T cells. This alteration could contribute to the abnormal expansion of pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (Th17) cells and an altered phenotype of T-regs [ 192 In SSc, abnormal activation of TGF-β is a signature of the disease, leading to excessive stimulation of fibroblasts and increased production of extracellular matrix components, causing the characteristic tissue fibrosis in the skin and internal organs [ 193 194 195 196 4.2. Other Growth Factors Involved in Autoimmune Diseases Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) drives macrophage polarization in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), contributing significantly to disease pathology [ 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 Figure 1 5. Challenges in Biomarker Development Cytokines and growth factors are central to immune regulation and tissue repair, making them attractive biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring. However, their inherent biological variability, such as short serum half-lives, low baseline concentrations, and context-dependent expression, complicates reliable measurement. For instance, cytokines involved in inflammation and immune response often fluctuate rapidly and may lack tissue or toxicity specificity, limiting their predictive power for certain conditions [ 204 205 206 207 The absence of standardized protocols for biomarker discovery and validation remains another significant barrier. Variability in sample handling, assay platforms, and data interpretation undermines the reliability of cytokine and growth factor measurements, hindering regulatory approval and clinical adoption [ 208 209 210 211 212 Multiplex technologies could greatly enhance the clinical management of autoimmune diseases by enabling simultaneous measurement of multiple immune markers, capturing disease complexity more effectively than single biomarkers [ 213 6. Therapeutic Implications Therapeutic strategies targeting cytokines and growth factors have become essential in the management of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases due to the critical roles these molecules play in regulating immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Advances in our understanding of their complex biology, alongside the development of precise targeted therapies, have significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with various autoimmune conditions. These therapeutic agents can be broadly classified into three categories based on their mechanisms of action: those that act on soluble signaling molecules by preventing or potentiating their activity, those that modulate cytokine or growth factor receptor activation, and those that interfere with intracellular signaling pathways—such as kinase inhibitors—that disrupt downstream signal transduction ( Figure 2 6.1. Targeting Secreted Immune Mediators in Autoimmune Therapy Pro-inflammatory cytokines play pivotal roles in driving autoimmune inflammation and consequent tissue damage. Therapeutic strategies targeting these cytokines have revolutionized treatment paradigms for autoimmune diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TNF inhibitors, exemplified by infliximab, disrupt cytokine-mediated signaling cascades, effectively reducing inflammation and improving clinical symptoms. Their efficacy is well-established through numerous clinical trials, leading to their widespread recommendation as first-line therapies in rheumatoid arthritis [ 214 215 216 217 218 219 Regarding systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), anti-TNF therapy is rarely used due to the potential induction of lupus-like syndromes, although etanercept has occasionally been employed with some success for refractory arthritis in clinical observational studies [ 220 221 Another target is IL-17, produced mainly by Th17 cells, which is foundational in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, PsA, and AS. IL-17 blockade, via agents like secukinumab and bimekizumab [ 222 223 In SS, IL-17 seems to have a role in the first phases of the disease, since IL-17 was found highly expressed in minor salivary glands of patients with disease duration less than 10 years, but not in their serum [ 224 Growing evidence supports their potential use in SS, with clinical studies investigating effects on sicca symptoms and dry eye manifestations (CTI: NCT01250171 A potential role of direct inhibitors of IL-17 in lupus nephritis has been suggested, since Th17 cells are involved in SLE pathogenesis as combination therapy, and after some successful case reports described in the literature, a phase III RCT to evaluate secukinumab in patients with active lupus nephritis has been conducted (CTI: NCT04181762 Although strong preclinical rationale supports IL-17 as a therapeutic target in RA, clinical trials provide mixed data; some demonstrate efficacy in biologic-naïve patients or those unresponsive to TNF inhibitors, whereas others indicate limited therapeutic impact, suggesting that IL-17 is not the sole pathological mediator in RA inflammation [ 225 Also, IL-12/IL-23 are involved in the IL-17 activation pathway. Ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12/IL-23, was approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis in 2013, but it has shown favorable outcomes in a phase II randomized controlled trial for patients with active lupus [ 226 227 Tildrakizumab, risankizumab, and guselkumab are IL-23p19 inhibitors, effective for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [ 228 Novel monoclonal antibodies against IL-1β, such as canakinumab, are under clinical evaluation, showing promising modulation of disease activity and favorable safety profiles [ 229 230 Immunotherapeutic strategies are increasingly focusing on enhancing regulatory cytokines such as IL-10. Studies conducted on recombinant human IL-10 (rhIL-10) for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have shown weak and inconsistent efficacy, partly attributable to its short half-life and the presence of pro-inflammatory properties that may counterbalance its beneficial effects [ 231 232 233 6.2. Targeting Cell Surface Receptors in Autoimmune Therapy Tocilizumab is an anti-IL-6 receptor antagonist and is approved in several countries for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, thanks to clinical trials and real-world data that confirm its efficacy from both a clinical and radiological point of view [ 234 235 Among connective tissue diseases, the most consistent data regarding the efficacy of IL-6 pathway inhibition came from the FocuSSced trial, in which tocilizumab or placebo was administered to patients with SSc [ 235 Although the primary endpoint of the study, which was the improvement of skin fibrosis, was not met, it was noted that patients treated with tocilizumab had an improvement and stabilization of respiratory outcomes in the context of systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease [ 236 237 Considering the integral role of this cytokine in SS, the drug has also been tested in a randomized controlled trial in patients with SS. Nevertheless, tocilizumab did not improve systemic involvement and symptoms during treatment [ 238 239 240 Clinical and preclinical studies have also underscored the therapeutic potential of IL-1β blockade in rheumatic disease. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in reducing joint inflammation and slowing structural damage in RA patients, while showing no significant benefit in psoriatic arthritis [ 241 242 Anti-interferon α receptor monoclonal antibody anifrolumab targets the IFN-α receptor and has shown promise in SLE following TULIP I and II trials, impacting multiple type I and II IFN-induced gene modules/pathways and type III IFN-λ protein levels [ 243 244 The presence of an IFN signature has been observed also in other connective tissue diseases like Sjogren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and a subset of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, so multiple trials targeting this pathway are starting to recruit or have already recently started. A pivotal Phase III study, referred to as the DAISY trial (CTI: NCT05925803 Moreover, a phase 2 multicenter study, TarIFNiRA (CTI: NCT03435601 245 6.3. Targeting Intracellular Signaling Pathways in Autoimmune Therapy JAK-STAT inhibition has become a new therapeutic option for several rheumatologic conditions in recent years. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) are small oral molecules that prevent the phosphorylation of JAKs, thus interfering with the production of several inflammatory cytokines. The efficacy and safety of several JAKis, such as tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and filgotinib, in patients with RA, PsA, and AS have been comprehensively investigated in several clinical trials. Consequently, JAK inhibitors have been approved and registered as a treatment for patients with this inflammatory arthritis. In patients with RA, JAKi are efficient in reducing disease activity, pain, and morning stiffness; in reaching ACR response; in suppressing radiographic joint damage progression; and in improving bone properties in patients naive to biological treatment as well as in patients with inadequate response to previous lines of therapy [ 246 247 In patients with psoriatic arthritis, JAKi studies demonstrated that these drugs are effective for cutaneous and articular manifestations, for dactylitis and enthesitis, and also for slowing radiographic progression [ 248 249 250 251 Since the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway is responsible for an increase in IFN production, multiple JAK inhibitors (JAKi) are currently being considered in patients with SLE. In general, the results of phase II and phase III studies and real-life observations are not always consistent, and as a result, JAKi are not currently considered to be first-line treatments in patients with SLE, but their use is limited to clinical manifestations that do not respond to conventional treatment with traditional and biological DMARDs. Tofacitinib, a prevalent JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitor, has been successfully tested in preclinical studies and afterwards in phase I/II clinical trials with good results in the improvement of cardiometabolic and immunologic parameters associated with the premature atherosclerosis in SLE, including type I IFN gene signature and circulating NETs [ 252 The results of a retrospective analysis of a SLE Chinese cohort (CSTAR: Chinese SLE Treatment and Research Group) involving 109 patients with active mucocutaneous and joint involvement have recently been published. Patients treated with tofacitinib experienced a better resolution of these manifestations when compared to methotrexate, with a comparable safety profile [ 253 Mucocutaneous manifestations such as alopecia, as well as arthritis, seem to be the kind of manifestations that respond best to the addition of JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib, confirming that these drugs may be an effective therapeutic option for treating patients with these involvements, especially when they have been resistant to previous treatments. Another JAK inhibitor, baricitinib, has been more extensively studied in patients with SLE, even in this case showing efficacy in controlling skin and joint manifestations [ 254 Despite the positive results of the initial trials and the satisfactory results of several case reports described in the literature in patients with cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and renal involvement, the two phase 3 trials, SLE-BRAVE I and SLE-BRAVE II, failed to reach the objectives [ 255 More recently, a newer generation JAKi, which selectively inhibits JAK1, upadacitinib, has proven to be effective in patients with moderate to severe SLE, and these positive results have also been confirmed by the long-term extension study. Upadacitinib seems to be able to reduce steroid intake, activity of disease, and type I IFN pathway protein expressions [ 256 NCT05843643 Finally, another JAK1 inhibitor, filgotinib, has been used in a phase II multicenter study in patients with class V lupus nephropathy, demonstrating good results, despite the small number of participants [ 257 The JAK/STAT pathway also takes part in the process of SS by affecting many cytokine signals, and several basic studies suggest that JAK inhibitors may be effective for pSS. Currently, there are several studies that suggest the efficacy of this class of drugs in Sjogren’s syndrome; however, more consistent results are needed to be able to use them more safely and consciously in our clinical practice. One of the first drugs in this class to be tested with laboratory studies was tofacitinib. The efficacy of tofacitinib has been studied in one retrospective and one prospective cohort of patients with SS, analyzing changes in clinical and laboratory parameters, as well as modifications in circulating T cell subsets. Despite several limitations in study design, tofacitinib improves multiple parameters, suggesting its potential use as a therapeutic option in SS patients [ 258 Following the positive results of the pilot study on baricitinib in SS patients in terms of reduction in activity of analyzing disease [ 259 NCT05016297 Filgotinib, a JAK-1 preferential inhibitor, has been tested, together with other TYK inhibitors, in a recent randomized trial. Although either primary or secondary endpoints were not met, it seems that a group of patients with highly active systemic disease, based on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and high patient-reported SS symptoms, could benefit from the therapy with filgotinib [ 260 The use of JAK-i is also increasing in systemic sclerosis; through inhibition of multiple inflammatory cytokines, JAK-I could also block critical mediators in the fibrotic process, thereby reducing skin and visceral fibrosis. A recent systematic review on the use of JAK inhibitors in systemic sclerosis shows that there are almost a hundred cases of patients successfully treated with JAK inhibitors, and in most cases, the type of disease involvement was a combination of skin and interstitial or skin and gastrointestinal involvement. Tofacitinib was used by most patients, and an improvement was reported in almost 90% of cases, while adverse effects were reported by approximately half of the patients [ 261 JAK inhibitors could represent a promising tool in these patients, and their efficacy and safety need to be confirmed with further studies. While JAK inhibitors exhibit promising therapeutic potential for several rheumatic diseases, they have potential side effects that warrant careful consideration. JAK-STAT pathways are also involved in key biological processes like adipogenesis and hematopoiesis; therefore, these drugs could cause various predictable side effects. Moreover, regarding safety, the ORAL Surveillance study found that patients with RA aged 50 or more who had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, if treated with tofacitinib, had an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with those treated with TNFi and also an increased risk of malignancy [ 262 Similarly, baricitinib and TNF inhibitors were compared in patients with RA in an observational study: baricitinib was associated with a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism and major cardiovascular events [ 263 As a result, both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued a statement cautioning against the use of all JAKi as the first option in patients over 65 years of age, smokers, and those with cardiovascular risk factors, a history of thromboembolic events, or a history of malignancy. Nintedanib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor able to turn off growth factors such as TGF-beta, FGF and PDGF receptors, has gained significant attention for its antifibrotic properties, particularly in the management of interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with various autoimmune and connective tissue diseases [ 264 NCT02999178 265 266 267 NCT02597933 268 269 270 271 272 273 7. Conclusions Autoimmune diseases exhibit significant heterogeneity and complex cytokine networks, making personalized medicine essential for optimal treatment. Biomarker-driven strategies enable tailored cytokine and growth factor modulation, improving efficacy while reducing adverse effects. This approach relies on molecular, genetic, and immunologic biomarkers to stratify patients and customize therapies. Combination treatments targeting multiple cytokines or integrating cytokine inhibitors with conventional immunosuppressants are being explored to enhance synergy, control disease better, and overcome partial responses. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including variable patient responses, infection risks, and compensatory cytokine pathways that limit durability. Advances in multiplex biomarker profiling, genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, combined with machine learning, are facilitating the development of next-generation, patient-specific therapies. Integration of genetic, proteomic, and clinical data helps predict individual treatment responses and identify non-responders early. Furthermore, emerging modalities such as nanobodies, exosome-based delivery, and gene editing offer higher target specificity, improved drug stability, and reduced systemic effects, all aiming to achieve more precise and durable cytokine-targeted treatments. In summary, the future of cytokine and growth factor modulation in autoimmune diseases is poised for a transformative leap through the fusion of biomarker-driven personalized medicine, cutting-edge therapeutic technologies, and innovative combination strategies. This combination will allow the delivery of treatments that are not only more effective but also safer and finely tailored to individual patient profiles. As reported and discussed in this review, it is clear that cytokines and growth factors play a pivotal role as master regulators of immune function, where their dysregulation drives both the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmune pathology. Their dual capacity to mediate inflammation and immune regulation underscores the necessity of fine-tuned cytokine targeting, which only personalized approaches can achieve. By leveraging integrated biomarker information and advanced delivery systems, future therapies aim to recalibrate cytokine networks precisely, minimizing collateral immune suppression and enhancing long-term disease remission.
