Introduction Inflammation is a fundamental pathological response of the body, representing a defensive reaction of vascularized living tissues to various injurious stimuli. It is a common feature of the pathological processes of numerous diseases. While inflammation can be beneficial in resisting harmful external stimuli and limiting injury progression, excessive or dysregulated inflammatory responses, such as those seen in autoimmune disorders, can exacerbate tissue damage and contribute to disease severity. 1–3 4,5 Disulfiram (DSF), an FDA-approved medication for alcoholism, has recently emerged as a promising anti-inflammatory agent. It is a disulfide derivative of diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC), and it possesses the chemical structure C 10 20 2 4 2 5 2 2 2 Fig. 2A 6 ii 2 7 8–11 7 12 et al. 13,14 15–17 12,18–21 22–24 23,25 Traditionally administered orally for alcoholism, DSF exhibits poor pharmacokinetic properties that limit its therapeutic efficacy. 26–28 via 29 30,31 32–35 This review first explores the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of DSF, including both GSDMD-related and non-GSDMD-related pathways. Subsequently, it provides a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in DSF-based nano-delivery strategies designed for inflammatory diseases, to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects by optimizing drug-delivery systems. Finally, contemporary researches on the therapeutic applications of DSF in inflammatory diseases are summarized, highlighting emerging trends and innovative delivery approaches that expand its clinical potential ( Fig. 1 8,36–38 Fig. 1 Illustration of the anti-inflammatory mechanisms, delivery strategies, and disease spectrum of DSF.

Anti-inflammatory mechanisms of DSF In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of DSF, revealing multiple molecular pathways through which it exerts its therapeutic effects. 39 40 22,41 2.1 GSDMD-related mechanisms The Gasdermin (GSDM) family comprises a group of structurally related proteins implicated in immune-related pore formation. Among them, GSDMD contains three distinct domains: an N-terminal cytotoxic domain, a C-terminal inhibitory domain, and a central flexible linker 42,43 Fig. 2B via 14 Fig. 2 (A) The molecular structure of DSF. (B) Overall structures of human GSDMDs. 50 50 GSDMD palmitoylation plays a pivotal role in the membrane translocation of N-GSDMD. Hu et al. 12 S 44 et al. 45 12,46–48 et al. Fig. 2C 22 et al. 49 The inflammatory factors and other mediators of immune responses released through GSDMD pores can be inhibited by DSF in inflammatory responses. 20 44,51,52 53,54 55 56,57 58 2.2 Non-GSDMD-related mechanisms 2.2.1 RNF115-STING As a dimeric transmembrane protein on the endoplasmic reticulum, the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is crucial for DNA-associated signaling communication. After the DNA in the cytoplasm binds to cyclic guanine nucleotide–adenine nucleotide synthetase, STING is activated by second messenger cGAMPs that bind to STING proteins and cause conformational changes. 59–61 62,63 64 via 22 22 2.2.2 RIPK1 Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a key serine/threonine kinase involved in cell death regulation, consisting of an N-terminal kinase structural domain, an intermediate RHIM structural domain, and a C-terminal death domain. 65,66 et al. 23 2.2.3 FROUNT FROUNT proteins can regulate monocyte/macrophage migration via 67 68 24 Chen et al. in vivo in vitro 69 et al. 70 via 2.2.4 Others In addition to these well-defined pathways, several emerging targets have been implicated in DSF's anti-inflammatory effects. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) plays a pivotal role in modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which governs antioxidant responses, as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, which drives pyroptotic cell death. Consequently, GSK-3β is intricately linked to oxidative stress, pyroptosis, and inflammatory processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that DSF mitigates oxidative-damage-associated pyroptosis and inflammation by downregulating GSK-3β and NLRP3, thereby attenuating LPS-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in both in vivo in vitro 71 et al. 72 41 3.

(D) Cellular uptake of targeted nanoparticles visualized via n n n 32 32 3.2 Polymeric nanomedicine Homopolymers, copolymers, and natural polymers have been widely used in the design and preparation of various polymeric nanomedicine carriers. Polymeric nanomedicine can be more easily engineered into smart nanoparticles with a wide range of stimulus-responsive structures. Consequently, the application of polymeric nanomedicine improves the water solubility of conventional medicines and offers high responsiveness to local stimuli. 97 Encapsulating DSF with quaternized palmitoyl glycol chitosan, characterized by a significant positive surface charge (+50.9 ± 1.3 mV), enhances the colloidal stability of nanoparticles and results in improved pharmacokinetics of DSF. 98 74 99 co via in vitro in vivo 33 Some polymeric nanomaterials have limitations, such as poor pharmacokinetics, premature drug release into the bloodstream, accumulation in non-target tissues, and limited drug penetration in target tissues. Although the controllability of the physicochemical properties of nano-delivery systems can be increased by the addition of stabilizers, the addition may be detrimental to the bioavailability and blood concentration maintenance time of DSF. 100 101 1 4 5 Fig. 4A Fig. 4B and C 1 4 5 102,103 et al.

(C) Mean plasma concentration–time profiles of CuET SP and CuET NCs following oral administration at a dose of 60 mg kg −1 0–24 −1 75 75 In recent years, metal–organic frameworks have attracted increasing interest as nanocarriers. Due to their high specific surface area and porosity, they can be used for the high loading of therapeutic drugs, and with the assistance of organic materials, they can enhance certain properties of metal-based nano-delivery systems and reduce the side effects produced by metals. 34 2+ 2+ in situ 76 2+ 113 114 3.4 Peptide-based nanoparticles Peptides are inherently water-soluble, and peptide–drug conjugates, formed via 115,116 117–119 In vivo 77 Notably, peptides and proteins often possess functional domains that can themselves exert therapeutic effects, potentially acting synergistically with DSF. Lactoferrin (LF), a multifunctional glycoprotein with potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, has been incorporated into a DSF-LF nanoparticle system (DSF-LF NPs) that combines the immunosuppressive activities of both components. This formulation effectively inhibited macrophage pyroptosis and the release of inflammatory cytokines in both LPS-induced sepsis and UC models. 35 120 4. The spectrum of inflammatory diseases treated by DSF Beyond its well-characterized molecular mechanisms and advancements in nano-delivery systems, DSF has demonstrated therapeutic potential across a wide range of inflammatory disease models. Its ability to inhibit key inflammatory pathways, particularly GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, has positioned DSF as a versatile candidate for the treatment of inflammation-driven conditions. This section provides a detailed overview of DSF's application in various non-oncologic inflammatory diseases, including respiratory, digestive, autoimmune, urinary, infectious, and other systemic disorders. 4.1 DSF for respiratory diseases SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, primarily targets the respiratory system and is associated with various pulmonary complications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts were made to identify effective therapeutic agents, and a retrospective cohort study reported that DSF use was associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. 121 122 123,124 125 Beyond viral infections, various etiological factors can induce lung injury and provoke inflammatory responses, resulting in symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and chest pain. Zhao et al. 126 et al. Fig. 6A Fig. 6B 127 76 Fig. 6 The therapeutic potential of DSF in respiratory system diseases, digestive system diseases, and autoimmune diseases. (A and B) DSF inhibited GSDMD to suppress NET formation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This figure has been reproduced from ref. 127 127 128 128 129 129 Additionally, a recent bioinformatic analysis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient samples from the GEO database revealed elevated expression of GSDMD in airway epithelial cells. Subsequent in vivo 20 4.2 DSF for digestive diseases DSF has demonstrated substantial therapeutic potential for use in various digestive tract inflammatory diseases, functioning by targeting pyroptosis and modulating the associated inflammatory pathways. Hepatitis, characterized by hepatocellular degeneration, necrosis, and inflammation, may progress to cirrhosis if left untreated. DSF has been shown to mitigate hepatocyte pyroptosis and suppress hepatic inflammation by downregulating NLRP3, GSDMD, and caspase-1 expression both in vitro in vivo 51 130,131 132 Akkermansia muciniphila via 133 Acute pancreatitis (AP), which is often accompanied by severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever, requires urgent therapeutic intervention due to its potential progression to systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Recent findings have demonstrated that DSF exerts significant protective effects in AP by targeting GSDMD and modulating multiple inflammatory pathways. DSF administration led to reduced serum levels of lipase, amylase, TNF-α, and IL-6, thereby alleviating pancreatic inflammation ( Fig. 6C 128 23,134,135 In the context of IBD, such as radiation-induced enteritis and UC, DSF has demonstrated efficacy through the inhibition of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. Notably, it has been reported that dual deficiency of GSDMD and GSDME is essential for achieving optimal therapeutic benefit in colitis. 72 71,75,136,137 138 4.3 DSF for autoimmune diseases The prevalence of autoimmune diseases has steadily increased, driving demand for effective immunomodulatory therapies. DSF has shown promising efficacy in mitigating various autoimmune conditions and transplant-associated immune rejection. In vitro Fig. 6D Fig. 6E Fig. 6F 129 139,140 17,141 22 142 As critical mediators of inflammatory injury, macrophages contribute to both acute cellular allograft rejection and chronic injury, with their infiltration linked to poorer graft function and prognosis. 143 et al. 144 145 146 4.4 DSF for urinary diseases Kidneys can suffer from various inflammatory diseases, and irreversible renal failure can easily occur if the diseases are not treated properly. DSF has demonstrated robust therapeutic efficacy in various renal inflammatory disorders. Specifically, DSF inhibits monocyte and macrophage recruitment by targeting the FROUNT signaling pathway, thereby reducing inflammatory infiltration and tissue injury in models of glomerulonephritis. 24,70 Studies have shown that DSF exhibits good therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of glomerulonephritis. 70,147,148 In vitro in vivo e.g. 149 Fig. 7A Fig. 7B 147 et al. 148 Fig. 7 The therapeutic potential of DSF in urinary system diseases, infectious diseases, and other inflammatory diseases. (A) DSF alleviated podocyte injury by inhibiting ADR-induced pyroptosis. (B) The expression levels of NLRP3, N-GSDMD/GSDMD, caspase-1/pro-caspase-1, and IL-1β/pro-IL-1β were significantly decreased. This figure has been reproduced from ref. 147 147 + + 150 International Journal of Biological Sciences 150 151 151 4.5 DSF for infectious diseases Severe infections may progress to sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated host immune response and potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction. Recent studies have highlighted the role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, alongside the activation of inflammasomes and STING1, in exacerbating coagulation and systemic inflammation during sepsis progression. 152 153–155 et al. 156 In vitro In DSF-treated CLP mice, platelet activation, measured by the percentage of CD41 + + Fig. 7C Fig. 7D 150,157,158 via 159–161 In vivo 150 4.6 DSF for other inflammatory diseases In addition to respiratory, digestive, autoimmune, urinary, and infectious conditions, DSF has shown therapeutic efficacy in other inflammation-associated diseases through the inhibition of GSDMD activation and NET formation. Notably, DSF impairs the activation of peptidylarginine deiminase 4, which plays a key role in the formation of NETs by mediating histone citrullination. Since NETosis is closely linked to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and GSDMD, DSF effectively suppresses this cascade. In patients with diabetic foot ulcers, DSF treatment significantly decreased the expression of NET markers, such as citrullinated histone H3 and cell-free DNA, as well as key proteins in the NLRP3 signaling pathway, indicating strong anti-inflammatory activity. 162 p 163 In vivo Fig. 7E 151 in vitro in vivo 164 165,166 5. Summary and prospect This review highlights recent advances in the research on the anti-inflammatory effects of DSF and elucidates its underlying mechanisms. Its central mode of action involves the covalent modificationof cysteine residues crucial for palmitoylation and depalmitoylation on GSDMD, thereby disrupting its proper membrane localization and oligomerization. Given the pivotal role of GSDMD in pyroptosis and inflammatory responses, the inhibition of this pathway by DSF significantly attenuates inflammation. 48 DSF has emerged as a broad-spectrum therapeutic agent with demonstrated efficacy across systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, metabolic disorders, and infectious diseases. 167 72,126,156 72,126,156 36,168 Nano-delivery systems offer a promising solution to overcome DSF's pharmacokinetic limitations. The four major nanotechnologies discussed—lipid-based, polymer-based, metal-based, and peptide-based systems—each possess unique advantages and limitations. Collectively, they enhance DSF's solubility, targeting efficiency, and therapeutic index while minimizing systemic toxicity. Although the research on nano-delivery systems in inflammation is less extensive than in oncology, the accumulating evidence underscores the potential of nanotechnology to extend DSF's clinical utility for inflammatory diseases. However, nanomedicines still face some problems in applications. Currently, the most common route of nanomedicine delivery is the parenteral route, which cause adverse reactions in long-term administration of nanomedicines. Also, patient compliance and the convenience of drug administration may make this route inferior to the oral route. Furthermore, nanomedicine application is limited in clinical drug trials and industrial production links. Although the preclinical research related to nano-delivery systems is booming, the clinical translation rate is low. Most of the preclinical–clinical translations involve basic nanomedicines, while nanomedicines with specific functions, good targeting characteristics, and environmental sensitivity have not yet been successfully applied. 169 In conclusion, DSF exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties and, when integrated with nano-delivery strategies, holds significant promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. However, to bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical practice, further efforts are required to optimize nanocarrier design, enhance formulation scalability, and establish robust regulatory frameworks. Advancing these aspects will be key to unlocking the full therapeutic potential of DSF in future anti-inflammatory applications.
