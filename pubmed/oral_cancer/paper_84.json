Current treatments lack efficacy, being natural compounds explored as alternatives. Chestnut shells (CS) are rich in (poly)phenols with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties. This study aims to develop orodispersible films (OFs) with CS extract as active ingredient to manage OM. Methods OFs, prepared by solvent casting and incorporating the CS extract, were characterized regarding physicochemical, antioxidant/antiradical, and anticancer properties, as well as bioactive compounds permeation through in vitro ex vivo Results OFs revealed excellent features: thickness (125 µm), tensile strength (43.05 MPa), elongation (75.28%), weight (19 mg/cm 2 Conclusion CS-OFs offers a promising approach for preventing and treating OM, enhancing efficacy and patient comfort by delivering bioactive compounds directly to the oral mucosa. chestnut shells oral mucositis antioxidants solvent casting buccal in vitro porcine mucosa ex vivo assay FCT/MCTES, Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia and Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior UID/50006 Laboratório Associado para a Química Verde—Tecnologias e Processos Limpos as well as by Portuguese national funds through projects UIDB/50006/2020, UIDP/50006/2020, LA/P/0008/2020 Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P., in the scope of the project UIDP/04378/2020, UIDB/04378/202 Research Unit on Applied Molecular Biosciences—UCIBIO LA/P/0140/2020 Aliança para a Investigação e Ensino Superior The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are consistently observed at physiologically relevant concentrations (10–100 µg/ml extract equivalents), whereas antimicrobial and antitumor effects generally require higher doses ( 18 Oral dosage forms continue to be the prevalent approach for drug administration owing to patient compliance and convenience, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility for large-scale manufacturing, when compared to injections and inhalers ( 20 21 4 20 21 22 24 25 This study aimed to incorporate the CS extract into OFs and evaluate their capacity to alleviate OM symptoms. To achieve this objective, the mechanical, physicochemical, antioxidant/antiradical, and cytotoxic properties of the formulated OFs were quantitatively assessed, along with the permeation of key bioactive compounds, using validated in vitro ex vivo 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals All chemicals and standards used were of analytical reagent grade, while all chromatographic solvents were of HPLC-HRMS grade specifications.

( 14 R 2 4 2 n 2.4.9 2.4.12 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) SEM analysis was performed using a high-resolution (Schottky) Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope with x-Ray Microanalysis and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (FEI Quanta 400 FEG ESEM/EDAX Genesis X4M). Samples were coated with an Au/Pb thin film for 80 s and with a 15 mA current by sputtering using SPI Module Sputter Coater equipment. 2.4.13 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) The interactions between the OFs polymeric matrix and the incorporated extract were evaluated using an FTIR Nicolet 6700—Diamond Point (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and the potassium bromide (KBr) method ( 29 −1 −1 2.4.14 Thermal properties (DSC) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the OFs and lyophilized chestnut shells extract were obtained using a DSC 200 F3 Maia (Netzsh-Geratebau GmbH, Germany) with an empty aluminum pan as a reference. 5–10 mg of samples were placed in a sealed aluminum pan and heated from 0 to 200°C at a ramping rate of 10°C/min. Nitrogen was used as the purging gas at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. The onset temperatures were calculated using the Proteus Analysis software (version 6.1, Netzsh-Geratebau GmbH, Germany). 2.4.15 Mucoadhesive strength Porcine buccal mucosal tissue was obtained from a local slaughterhouse to evaluate the mucoadhesive properties of the prepared films. Using a texture analyzer coupled with a mucoadhesion rig (A/MUC) from Stable Micro Systems ( 30 2 n 2.5 Cytotoxicity OFs cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay in two human cancer cell lines, namely HSC3 and TR146, as well as in an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. Passages 18, 33, and 39 were used for HSC3, TR146, and HaCaT cells, respectively. Cells were cultured and plated as described by Ferreira et al.

The solvent gradient ( v/v m/z 33 − m/z Compounds identified were putatively annotated using the MS-finder and MS-dial software (open source version 4.25, created by Prof. Masanori Arita team (RIKEN) and Prof. Oliver Fiehn team (UC Davis)) ( 35 37 http://phenol-explorer.eu/ http://foodb.ca/ Quantitative analysis was performed by using a validated chromatographic method ( 38 Gallic acid: R 2 3-Hydroxybenzoic acid: R 2 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid: R 2 Dihydroferulic acid R 2 Epicatechin: R 2 Chlorogenic acid: R 2 Phlorizin: R 2 Naringin: R 2 Rutin: R 2 Protocatechuic acid: R 2 in vitro ex vivo 2.9 Statistical analysis Results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, following verification of normality and homogeneity of variances with the Shapiro–Wilk and Levene's tests, respectively. Tukey's HSD test was used for post hoc p 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Preparation of OFs In addition to their resistance and stability, OFs must be manageable and flexible. Moreover, OFs must have adequate mucoadhesive properties and release the bioactive compounds, allowing the permeation through the buccal mucosa. The OFs polymers used in the present study were selected after conducting a literature review and obtaining preliminary results (data not shown). Based on qualitative parameters such as flexibility and uniformity, HPMC E10M, a semi-synthetic polymer derived from cellulose, was selected. The application of cellulosic polymers in the production of solid extended-release dosage forms is facilitated by their exceptional film-forming properties and extensive grade selection, despite not being pH-responsive ( 39 39 40 40 The thin, transparent, homogeneous, flexible, and mucoadhesive coatings produced by the HPMC E10M formulation exhibited no visible fissures or air bubbles. CS-loaded OFs exhibited a brown coloration ( Figure 1 41 42 Figure 1 Formulated OFs after detachment from petri dishes: (A) (B) Two round film samples labeled A and B on a beige surface. Sample A is translucent and clear, while Sample B is opaque and dark brown. 3.2 Characterization of OFs 3.2.1 Mechanical properties The mechanical features of an optimal OF is determined by a variety of factors, including the microstructural network and constituents, interplay between matrix additives and preparation conditions, plasticizer, and pre-existing intermolecular forces ( 43 45 Table 1 Table 1 Mechanical properties of formulated oral films (OFs), placebo and loaded with C. sativa n Formulation Thickness (µm) Rupture tensile strength (MPa) Elongatio n Young's modulus (MPa) Folding endurance Placebo OFs 136 ± 8 a 47.76 ± 1.11 a 60.18 ± 7.43 a 1,245.28 ± 26.43 a >300 CS-loaded OFs 125 ± 9 a 43.05 ± 1.29 a 75.28 ± 7.27 a 1,141.74 ± 39.71 b >300 Different letters (a, b) in the same column means significant differences between samples ( p In addition to affecting mucoadhesion and oral comfort, film thickness is an essential factor related to the accuracy of the drug dosage. The barrier characteristics of the buccal mucosa and the rate of dissolution and disintegration may also be affected by thickness. Placebo and CS-loaded films (136 and 125 µm, respectively) showed no significant differences ( p 26 OFs must possess a substantial tensile strength to endure the stress associated with its production, packaging, transportation, and routine handling, because an insufficient tensile strength will result in rapid drug release from the matrix. As shown in Table 1 p 46 Tedesco et al. studied the production of an OF with HPMC E15 incorporating peanut skin extract and reported a maximum tensile strength of 26.63 MPa ( 47 48 Elongation is an indicator of flexibility, in which the concentrations of polymer, plasticizer, and extract are key aspects. CS-loaded OFs revealed a similar elongation percentage (75.28%) to placebo OFs (60.18%), with no significant differences ( p 49 40 49 The tensile strength and elongation results corroborate the Young's modulus values, indicating resistance to deformation. As the tensile strength decreased and the elongation percentage increased, the Young's modulus decreased. The Young's modulus of the placebo OFs was significantly higher (1,245.28 MPa) than that of the CS-loaded OFs (1,141.74 MPa) ( p 50 After being folded more than 300 times in the same place, the OFs were still unbroken, without signs of degradation, and showed a high level of flexibility, probably due to the presence of glycerol, denoting high mechanical strength. These results are in line with previous studies demonstrating the excellent mechanical performance of HPMC polymers ( 51 3.2.2 Physicochemical properties The physicochemical properties of OFs, such as weight, moisture content, swelling capacity, disintegration time, and surface pH, are crucial for the patient compliance. As reported in Table 1 2 p OFs' mucoadhesion (related to comfort application) and stability (specifically microbial contamination) are highly influenced by the moisture content. A suitable water content not only mitigates the fragility of the OFs, but also acts as a powerful plasticizer ( 23 20 p Table 2 Table 2 Physicochemical properties of formulated orodispersible films (OFs), placebo and loaded with C. sativa shells (CS) extract ( n Formulation Weight (mg/cm 2 Moisture content (%) Swelling capacity (%) Disintegration time (min:s) Surface pH Placebo OFs 18.0 ± 1.25 a 4.36 ± 0.37 a 9.13 ± 0.19 a 18:35 ± 1:17 a 6.98 ± 0.09 a CS-loaded OFs 19.0 ± 0.25 a 4.25 ± 0.35 a 7.31 ± 0.89 b 20:43 ± 1:38 a 6.94 ± 0.19 a Different letters (a, b) in the same column means significant differences between samples ( p The rate of drug release and mucoadhesive properties of the OFs, which are affected by the structure and composition of the polymeric matrix, can be determined through swelling evaluation ( 52 53 54 55 The disintegration time indicates the onset of the drug action. A low disintegration time leads to a faster release and absorption of the loaded drug through the oral mucosa. The disintegration time was evaluated in artificial saliva (pH 6.8) at 37°C to mimic the oral conditions. Placebo OFs disintegrated after 18 min and CS-loaded OFs after more than 20 min, without significant differences ( p 48 Surface pH is an important attribute of OFs intended to be applied to mucous membranes, since it can be related to eventual local damage or irritation, causing discomfort to patients. The pH of human saliva ranges from 6.2 and 7.6, with a specific value of 6.3 for the buccal mucosa ( 56 3.2.3 Stability Stability assays are essential for the development of new drug delivery systems. Additionally, these tests should be performed on OFs to determine the behavior of their components and identify any potential degradations or interactions. Products must be stable after manufacturing to comply with the standards set by the International Council of Harmonization (ICH), with packaging providing mechanical protection and acting as a crucial barrier against light, moisture, and oxygen ( 26 57 Table 3 Table 3 Effects of storage at room temperature and accelerated conditions on the properties of the C. sativa shells (CS) extract loaded Oral Films (OFs) ( n CS-loaded OFs Storage conditions (25°C/65% RH) Time (days) Rupture tensile strength (MPa) Elongation (%) Folding endurance Disintegration time (min:s) Surface pH Physical appearance 0 43.05 ± 1.29 75.28 ± 7.27 >300 20:43 ± 01:38 6.94 ± 0.19 – 15 42.78 ± 1.45 76.31 ± 5.79 >300 19:33 ± 02:55 6.89 ± 0.24 No change 30 43.20 ± 1.34 77.02 ± 5.54 >300 20:13 ± 01:36 6.91 ± 0.13 No change 60 44.05 ± 2.03 77.89 ± 3.41 >300 21:01 ± 00:59 6.92 ± 0.09 No change 90 41.05 ± 1.79 76.12 ± 4.76 >300 20:22 ± 01:41 6.95 ± 0.21 No change Accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) 0 41.27 ± 1.35 76.82 ± 5.86 >300 19:27 ± 01:13 6.92 ± 0.15 - 15 42.35 ± 2.64 75.87 ± 6.15 >300 20:14 ± 02:41 6.87 ± 0.18 No change 30 41.63 ± 1.67 74.23 ± 4.69 >300 21:53 ± 02:05 6.94 ± 0.26 No change 60 40.97 ± 2.53 74.75 ± 2.71 >300 22:05 ± 01:52 6.83 ± 0.21 No change 90 39.05 ± 1.39 73.87 ± 3.67 >300 22:43 ± 00:43 6.74 ± 0.18 No change As can be observed, the folding endurance of the OFs remained in the acceptable range of more than 300-fold even after 90 days of storage at 40°C/75% RH. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in terms of tensile strength, elongation, physical appearance, disintegration time, or surface pH. The absence of significant differences for all parameters at room temperature (25°C/65% RH) or under accelerated conditions (40°C/ 75% RH) indicate a good physicochemical stability for the developed OFs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed the stability of OFs using natural extracts as active ingredients. 3.2.4 Phenolic content and antioxidant/antiradical activities One of the main triggers in the development of OM is oxidative stress, which can be minimized with the use of natural antioxidants, particularly delivery systems. Table 4 Table 4 Total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (FRAP and DPPH) of formulated oral films (OFs), placebo and loaded with C. sativa shells (CS) extract ( n Formulation TPC (mg GAE/g film) DPPH (mg TE/g film) FRAP (µmol FSE/g film) Placebo OFs ND ND ND CS-loaded OFs 37.05 ± 1.20 143.42 ± 3.41 0.142 ± 0.01 ND, Not Determined. As expected, placebo OFs did not show results for these assays. In a previous study, our team evaluated the phenolic content of the dry CS extract and reported a TPC value of 239.53 mg GAE/g DW ( 14 v/v 14 The same ratio was not observed in the antioxidant/antiradical assays. However, due to the potential interference of the polymer or plasticizer in these assays, it is expected that the OFs would yield lower results than the dry extracts. The CS-loaded OFs achieved a result of 143.43 mg TE/g film (dry extract: 426.88 mg TE/g DW) and 0.142 µmol FSE/g film (dry extract: 4,092.98 µmol FSE/g DW) for the DPPH and the FRAP assays, respectively. A potential reason may be the low ability of the natural antioxidants present in the extract to scavenge DPPH free radicals or to bind to the FRAP ions, as they are entrapped in the polymeric matrix, particularly when the polymer is selected for its sustained release profile ( 58 Nonetheless, it should be highlighted that natural polyphenols are susceptible to oxidation and degradation under thermal or environmental stress, which can occur during film drying or prolonged storage. 3.2.5 SEM For ideal buccal application, the morphology of OFs should be homogeneous to ensure a uniform distribution of the bioactive content through the polymeric mixture. Additionally, interactions between drugs, polymers, and plasticizers may result in a rough OFs surface ( 26 Figure 2 Figure 2 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the produced oral films: (A) (B) Side-by-side comparison of two electron microscope images labeled A and B. Image A shows a uniform textured surface. Image B displays a smoother surface with scattered small particles. Both images are magnified at five thousand times and have a scale bar of twenty micrometers. The microscopic appearance of the OFs placebo (A) presented a homogeneous, continuous, and smooth surface, despite the presence of white dots in both OFs that were more noticeable in the CS-loaded OFs (B). These results are in line with the ones of Porfírio et al. , 59 3.2.6 Polymer and extract interactions FTIR was employed to assess the impact of CS extract incorporation on the intermolecular forces within the HPMC E10M OFs ( Figure 3 Figure 3 FTIR spectrum: (A) C. sativa (B) (C) Three overlapping infrared spectroscopy graphs labeled A, B, and C show absorbance versus wavenumbers from 4000 to 500 centimeters inverse. Graph A is purple with a peak around 3300, B is red with peaks at 3500 and 1000, and C is green showing peaks at 3500 and 1000. Each graph displays distinct absorption peaks and patterns. The extract introduction resulted in the emergence of new peaks in the OFs, suggesting potential modifications to the chemical structure of the HPMC matrix. Notable differences were observed in the 3,600–3,100 cm −1 60 61 62 The alterations observed in the 2,950–2,850 cm −1 −1 63 62 64 Based on the chemical nature of the constituents, it is not expect drastic shifts or new peak formations, supporting the physical compatibility of the components. 3.2.7 DSC The DSC thermograms, represented in Figure 4 Figure 4 DSC thermograms of C. sativa Graph showing endothermic heat flow versus temperature for four samples: CS extract, HPMC E10M polymer, Placebo OFs, and CS-Loaded OFs. The CS extract shows the highest peak around 125°C, while the CS-Loaded OFs have the lowest peak. Since there is a mixture of (poly)phenols in the matrix that can interact with each other, the thermal degradation may occur with the conversion of some compounds into different phenolic acids ( 14 65 3.2.8 Ex vivo mucoadhesive strength Mucoadhesion is influenced by the polymers physicochemical characteristics, such as charge, concentration, functional groups, and environmental factors. In fact, low-molecular-weight polymers are more effective at permeating mucous, whereas high-molecular-weight polymers become entangled with mucin more frequently. HPMC and other polymers in the cellulose derivative class have hydroxyl and carboxyl groups substituted for their natural cellulose backbones. Carboxyl groups attract water, resulting in significant diffusion and enlargement of polymer chains. Pharmacokinetics are improved through ionic and hydrogen bonding with mucin oligosaccharides, which prolongs the residence time of carboxylic groups at the application site. Furthermore, the flexibility of the polymeric matrix facilitates the formation of a greater number of hydrogen bonds ( 43 The mucoadhesive strength of the OFs was evaluated in porcine buccal mucosa using a texture analyzer, and the detachment force and work of adhesion were measured ( Table 5 Table 5 Mucoadhesive strength of formulated orodispersible films (OFs), placebo and loaded with C. sativa shells (CS) extract ( n Formulation Detachment force (N) Work of adhesion (N/mm) Placebo OFs 1.89 ± 0.41 0.26 ± 0.01 CS-loaded OFs 1.77 ± 0.23 0.19 ± 0.02 The detachment force was much lower than the one reported in other studies ( 66 67 p 66 67 3.3 Cytotoxicity In addition to the mechanical and biodegradable properties, polymer biocompatibility is a critical factor for its use in pharmaceutical applications. The MTT assay was performed on TR146, HSC-3, and HaCaT cells after 24 h of exposure to the OFs, as illustrated in Figure 5 Figure 5 Effects of placebo and CS-loaded OFs exposure on the viability of TR146 (A) (B) (C) n p Bar graphs labeled A, B, and C depict cell viability percentages across different concentrations of Placebo and CS-Loaded OFs. Graph A shows general decline with increased concentration, Graph B shows moderate decrease with notable drop at 100%, and Graph C highlights significant reduction at higher concentrations for both groups. Red bars represent Placebo OFs and green bars represent CS-Loaded OFs, with error bars indicating variability. TR146 and HSC-3 are human tumorigenic oral cell lines, commonly used as cellular models for studies on the oral cavity, while HaCaT is a human immortalized keratinocyte line derived from normal skin that has similarities with epidermis and epithelial tissue of the oral mucosa ( 68 69 70 The toxicity of CS-loaded OFs was higher than the placebo at the highest tested concentration (100%, no dilution), with viabilities of 47.22% and 67.91%, respectively. Similarly, as the placebo OFs led to a viability of 46.00% in the HSC-3 cell line, exposure to CS-loaded OFs resulted in a viability of 8.62%. This evidence confirmed the cytotoxic effects of the CS extract on both tumorigenic cell lines at the highest tested concentration. However, for diluted concentrations of OFs, this effect was not observed. Regarding HaCaT cells, a higher viability was observed after exposure to the highest concentration of the CS-loaded OFs (61.2%) than after exposure to the placebo OFs (35.06%), being categorized as classes 2 and 3, respectively. These results confirm the antitumor effect of the CS extract owing to the selectivity of its cytotoxic effects. Moreover, the reduced cellular viability may be due to the high viscosity of the polymer, which prevents the proper cellular division in 2D cellular models. 3.4 Metabolomic profile 3.4.1 in vitro The permeation of natural compounds from prepared OFs must be evaluated to assess their absorption across the buccal epithelium.

Regarding the CS extract, a total of 24 compounds were presumptively annotated, with a greater abundance of lipids (6 compounds, representing 25%) and amino acids (5 compounds, representing 21%), followed by (poly)phenols (5 compounds, representing 21%), organic acids (4 compounds, representing 17%), alcohols and polyols (3 compounds, representing 12%), and carbohydrates (1 compound, representing 4%) (see Supplementary Table S3 in vitro The amino acid L-tyrosine permeated the porcine buccal mucosa up to 66.76% and 135.84% at 30 min for the CS extract and CS-loaded OFs, respectively. This amino acid can be converted from phenylalanine (also identified in the CS extract) through hydroxylation, and is recognized for its antioxidant properties that protect the skin from the oxidative stress induced by UV radiation, supporting the skin's natural repair mechanism and promoting tissue regeneration ( 84 84 ® 85 85 Ellagic acid was also identified, permeating 6.26% and 60.75% of the CS extract and CS-loaded OFs, respectively. This phenolic acid is well known for its antioxidant activity in lipid peroxidation and metal chelation, which safeguards cells against oxidative damage. It also shows chemopreventive, antimicrobial, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antimutagenic activities ( 86 Overall, in vitro ex vivo ex vivo in vitro ex vivo in vitro ex vivo in vitro ex vivo Phenolic compounds often display limited oral (gastrointestinal) bioavailability due to the poor permeability and extensive first-pass metabolism. To address this, the present work targets buccal delivery, aiming a local action in the oral mucosa, while enabling transmucosal absorption that circumvents the first-pass metabolism. Consistent with this rationale, the in vitro ex vivo in vivo Potential strategies to enhance the polyphenols release in future studies include the use of polymer blends, such as combining HPMC with more hydrophilic or mucoadhesive polymers like PVA or chitosan, to better modulate the film hydration and control the release profile. Additionally, the incorporation of release enhancers or permeation modulators, such as surfactants, bile salts, or natural terpenes, may facilitate the phenolic compounds diffusion from the polymeric matrix. These approaches have shown promising results in other mucoadhesive and buccal delivery systems for improving the release and mucosal uptake of bioactives. Such strategies are particularly relevant for polyphenolic compounds, which often display limited mobility due to their molecular complexity and potential interactions within the polymer network. Generally, the incorporation of CS extract into orodispersible films resulted in a stable and functional delivery system with promising antioxidant, mucoadhesive, and permeation properties. Key bioactive compounds successfully permeated through in vitro ex vivo This study represents a preclinical proof of concept rather than a complete pharmacological evaluation. The findings support the buccal delivery of the selected phenolics, but further research is needed to confirm efficacy and safety in vivo 4 Conclusion This study demonstrated that CS extract can be successfully incorporated into OFs, yielding a stable and functional delivery system with antioxidant, mucoadhesive, and permeation properties relevant to OM prevention. Key phenolics, including epicatechin, protocatechuic acid, and isorhamnetin, permeated through in vitro ex vivo in vivo Acknowledgments The authors kindly thank Sortegel (Sortes, Portugal) for the samples.
