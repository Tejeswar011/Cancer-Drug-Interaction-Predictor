Introduction Pneumocystis jirovecii, P. carinii 1 2 P. jirovecii 2 PJP typically occurs in patients with profound cellular immunosuppression, including those with HIV, hematologic malignancies, solid organ transplants, or receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapies [ 2 3 1 3 1 4 This disease often presents as a subacute respiratory illness with fever, non-productive cough, and progressive dyspnoea [ 3 4 4 5 6 Despite its clinical impact, diagnosing PJP in critically ill patients remains challenging. The gold standard involves detection of P. jirovecii 7 8 9 3 10 10 1 3 4 Advances in real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and qPCR have markedly improved the sensitivity of P. jirovecii This systematic review aims to synthesize current evidence on the use of oropharyngeal wash-based PCR for the diagnosis of PJP in immunocompromised individuals, specifically in terms of (1) diagnostic accuracy; (2) feasibility and utility in critically ill patients; and (3) potential to substantiate timely and safe interventions in the ICU. In an era of precision and rapid diagnostics, addressing this evidence gap is crucial to improving outcomes in vulnerable patient populations. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Search Strategy and Data Sources We conducted a systematic review based on a comprehensive literature search performed between May and June 2025, aimed at identifying studies evaluating the detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii 2.2. Eligibility Criteria Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met all of the following criteria: (1) Included adult patients (≥18 years) who were immunocompromised due to an underlying disease or immunosuppressive therapy; (2) Employed PCR-based detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) Studies involving paediatric or immunocompetent populations; (2) PCR detection from lower respiratory tract samples only (e.g., spontaneous or induced sputum, mini-bronchoalveolar lavage [mini-BAL], or bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]); (3) Non-original research, including reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, editorials, opinion pieces, comments, conference abstracts, case reports with fewer than 10 patients (defined for the statistical power required for the diagnostic accuracy study intended in this review, limiting the diagnostic accuracy discrepancies in smaller-numbered studies), or studies with insufficient data; (4) Studies published before 1990, after June 2025, or in languages other than English. 2.3. Study Selection and Data Extraction Screening and data extraction were conducted independently and in random order by three investigators using the Rayyan ® 2.4. Quality Assessment The methodological quality and risk of bias of included studies were assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Three reviewers independently evaluated each study across four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The outcomes of the quality assessment were used to guide the interpretation of results and to perform sensitivity analyses. Studies identified as having a high risk of bias in key domains were evaluated separately to assess their potential impact on pooled estimates. The customized QUADAS-2 Checklist for review and the risk of bias assessment table are both included in the Electronic Supplementary Materials Tables S7 and S8 2.5. Data Synthesis A qualitative synthesis was performed to summarize the key characteristics and findings of the included studies. For the quantitative synthesis, we conducted a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy using a bivariate random-effects model (Reitsma model) to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, accounting for between-study heterogeneity. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to visualize diagnostic performance. Diagnostic accuracy data from each study (TP, FP, FN, TN) were used as input. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 p p 3. Results The literature search yielded 228 records, of which 92 duplicates were removed, leaving 136 publications for title and abstract screening. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 112 records were excluded, primarily due to irrelevant outcomes, inappropriate study populations, unsuitable publication types, or incompatible study designs. A total of 24 articles proceeded to full-text screening by all investigators (see PRISMA diagram, Figure 1 Table 1 Supplementary Materials Tables S1–S5 Table S6 3.1. General Characteristics of Included Studies The 12 studies included in this review [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 n Pneumocystis jirovecii P. jirovecii 11 12 13 14 18 19 20 21 15 17 18 20 21 16 20 22 All included studies focused on immunocompromised adult populations, as defined by the inclusion criteria. Most patients were HIV-positive, with only two studies (16.7%, n 16 22 13 19 21 16 3.2. Oropharyngeal Wash Collection and Detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii by PCR Across the studies included in this systematic review, the diagnostic utility of oropharyngeal wash samples for the detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii 3.2.1. Reference Standards Most of the included studies ( n 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 20 21 15 22 3.2.2. OW Sample Collection Protocols All studies employed sterile saline for OW collection, with 10 mL being the most frequently employed target volume [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 19 14 15 17 18 20 21 The study by Huang et al. specifically assessed the influence of both gargling duration and technique [ 17 The technique depicted in Figure 2 3.2.3. Factors Influencing Diagnostic Sensitivity Several pre-analytical factors were identified across the included studies as influencing the sensitivity of OW-based PCR testing. According to Huang et al., the following variables were associated with improved detection rates: Pre-sample cough induction, promoting mobilization of lower respiratory tract secretions; Prolonged and effective gargling, with 60 s being superior to shorter durations; Timing of collection, with samples obtained earlier in the disease course—prior to extended anti-PJP treatment—showing higher positivity rates [ 17 These findings were further supported by studies utilizing quantitative PCR (qPCR), which showed higher detection rates in patients with greater fungal loads and shorter durations of prior treatment [ 18 3.2.4. Safety and Feasibility No adverse events or complications related to OW collection were reported in any of the included studies, reinforcing the excellent safety profile of this procedure. In contrast to BAL, OW is non-invasive, simple, well-tolerated, and repeatable, representing a significant clinical advantage. 3.2.5. Sample Handling, Storage, and Transport Regarding transport, only one study [ 17 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 20 21 22 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 21 13 8 19 21 Three studies targeted RNA [ 17 20 22 17 20 22 3.3. Diagnostic Accuracy and Risk of Bias Assessment We performed a quantitative synthesis of diagnostic performance across the twelve studies evaluating PCR-based detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii The pooled sensitivity was 0.683 (95% CI: 0.592–0.759) and pooled false-positive rate was 0.082 (95% CI: 0.047–0.141), corresponding to a pooled specificity of 0.918 (95% CI: 0.859–0.953), as depicted in Figure 3 Figure 4 The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.887, indicating a high overall diagnostic accuracy. The normalized partial AUC, restricted to the observed false-positive rate range, was 0.698, reflecting moderate performance in the most clinically relevant specificity domain. A consistent sensitivity–specificity trade-off was evident across studies ( Figure 5 Between-study heterogeneity was moderate. The Zhou and Dendukuri I 2 2 Risk of bias, assessed using QUADAS-2 tool, was generally low across most domains. High risk was noted in patient selection in four studies, primarily due to case–control designs or poorly defined inclusion criteria. The index test was low risk in nearly all studies, with only one study rated high due to limited reporting on PCR thresholds or blinding. The reference standard was low risk in most studies, although three studies were rated high due to incomplete alignment with accepted PJP definitions. Applicability concerns were mainly related to patient selection (5/12 studies) and the reference standard (3/12 studies), while the index test was consistently applicable ( Tables S7 and S8 Supplementary Materials Finally, Deeks’ funnel plot asymmetry test indicated no significant evidence of publication bias ( p 4. Discussion This systematic review demonstrates the significant role that the use of PCR detection in oropharyngeal wash samples represents as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of PJP in immunocompromised patients. Our results are similar to recent meta-analyses investigating various non-invasive tools [ 23 24 23 25 24 In the last few years, PJP diagnosis has evolved, and PCR methods in induced sputum, as well as in BAL samples may now be used, according to the most current guidelines for both HIV (CDC/NIH guidelines [ 8 9 13 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Based on this review, the authors suggest a number of recommendations as guidelines for the clinical management: (1) Screening—OW PCR may serve as an initial test in moderate-to-high risk patients when other sampling methods are not feasible; (2) Positive result—A positive OW PCR, particularly when using qPCR to exclude colonization, may justify early treatment while waiting for definitive diagnosis; (3) Quantitative testing—Use of quantitative PCR methods is recommended to improve diagnostic accuracy; (4) Negative result—In stable and non-high-risk patients, a negative result may rule out infection; however, if clinical suspicion remains high, further diagnostic work-up is warranted. Additionally, the collection technique depicted in Figure 2 Strengths of this systematic review include a focused research question addressing a clinically relevant and present topic, PRISMA guideline adherence with a prospective search strategy, and prospective protocol registration in the PROSPERO database, thus providing scientific transparency, minimizing the risk of selective reporting and enhancing reproducibility. Moreover, the application of strict inclusion criteria ensured comparable patient populations and outcomes, strengthening the validity of pooled estimates. Furthermore, quality appraisal through the QUADAS-2 tool plainly documented risk of bias and applicability concerns, where most studies were found to be low risk in key domains, adding credibility to the synthesized results. The inclusion of safety analysis and identification of the influence of sample collection factors (e.g., gargling duration, cough induction, timing relative to treatment initiation) on diagnostic yield, adds practical, procedure-specific insights. The meta-analysis applied a bivariate random-effects model (Reitsma model) to jointly estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity, appropriately accounting for between-study heterogeneity. The inclusion of summary ROC curves, heterogeneity statistics, and publication bias testing (Deeks’ test) reflects a high level of statistical thoroughness. Lastly, clinical recommendations applicable in low-resource settings and with the potential to guide early treatment initiation, were provided. On the other hand, regarding limitations, the number of included articles was small, hampering the ability to characterize diagnostic performance. Despite its suggested use since the early 1990s, OW PCR remains relatively non-utilized. Furthermore, considerable methodological heterogeneity was observed across studies, particularly in PCR platforms, molecular targets and positivity thresholds—most likely attributable to evolving technological advancements. Nonetheless, these can obviously affect the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility. Moreover, the importance of differentiating infection versus colonization in these immunosuppressed patients cannot be undermined [ 24 26 9 Additionally, despite broadening the inclusion criteria for all immunocompromised patients, the great majority of the papers focused on HIV patients. As stated before, the epidemiology of PJP is transforming by moving away from untreated and severe cases of HIV and AIDS patients, to targeting other immunocompromised groups either by disease (haematological malignancies and others) or by pharmacological intervention (systemic corticosteroids, immunomodulators, etc.) [ 27 28 29 30 31 While our findings highlight the method’s clinical utility, they also reveal current limitations—including heterogeneity in PCR methodologies, variable reporting of pre-analytical conditions, and an overrepresentation of HIV-positive cohorts. Overall, despite acceptable methodological quality, variability in patient selection and reference standard criteria should be considered when interpreting pooled diagnostic performance. Hence, expanding research into non-HIV immunosuppressed populations and standardizing collection and analysis protocols will be critical for validating and optimizing this technique. Ultimately, in an era where rapid, patient-friendly diagnostics are increasingly essential, OW-based PCR has the potential to improve timely PJP detection, guide early therapeutic decisions, and ultimately reduce morbidity and mortality in vulnerable patient groups. 5.
