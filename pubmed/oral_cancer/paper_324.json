Tasmania has the lowest dental practitioner-to-population ratio in Australia, alongside long wait times and limited access to care in rural and regional areas. This perspective explores the demographic and workforce distribution trends that influence oral health service delivery in Tasmania using Census data, regulatory records, and key public sector audits. We highlight critical gaps in service provision and policy, reflect on the implications of the workforce maldistribution, argue for expanding the oral health therapy workforce and explore the transdisciplinary approaches currently implemented that prioritise sustainable, community-integrated oral health care. Such models align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), but also encompass SDGs 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13 and 17, which respond to environmental and social contexts. This perspective highlights the intersections of planetary health, oral health, and community well-being, arguing that sustainable, health-centred solutions must address both human and environmental health outcomes. sustainable development goals oral health workforce distribution access to care islands The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Systems Integration Introduction The island of Tasmania is Australia's smallest state, renowned for its clean air, natural beauty, and high quality of life. A 2025 study by Monash University found that Tasmania ranked as the healthiest state in Australia based on its Environmental Quality Health Index (EQHI), with Hobart named the healthiest capital city ( 1 2 2 More than half of all Tasmanian adults (58.4%) live with at least one chronic condition the highest proportion of all jurisdictions in Australia ( 3 4 5 2 6 7 Tasmania has the highest rural and remote population dispersion in Australia, with 32% of young people residing outside the four major local government areas ( 8 6 9 10 11 In response to global concerns, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the FDI World Dental Federation have prioritised oral health within broader public health agendas. The FDI Vision 2030 reaffirms the importance of oral health in managing noncommunicable diseases and achieving health equity ( 12 13 14 While no specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target explicitly addresses oral health, oral health professionals are recognised as part of the broader health workforce under SDG3: Target 3.c.1 ( 15 16 17 18 This paper explores the intersection of the Sustainable Development Goals and oral health in Tasmania, focusing on workforce distribution and access to care. A snapshot of the oral health situation in Tasmania Poor oral health is associated with being older, low levels of education and income, being Indigenous, and with living in rural areas ( 19 21 22 24 25 28 Yet, Tasmania has much to commend. Oral Health Services Tasmania (OHST), the island's public oral health sector, operates 33 clinics statewide, including three Special Care Dental Units in hospitals ( 29 30 31 OHST's innovative care includes graduate training programs ( 32 33 34 24 Preventive programs for schoolchildren (e.g., Fissure Sealants, Fluoride Varnish, Lift the Lip) and pregnant women (Smiles for Two) reflect SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities; Target 10.2) and SDG 3 (Target 3.8), while enhancing community health literacy in line with SDG 4 (Quality Education). Special services, including Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Tasmania offer conscious sedation for medically complex or hospitalised patients ( 24 Nearly all (96.6%) Tasmanians with access to reticulated water receive fluoridated water ( 35 37 38 Conversely, about 13% of Tasmanians smoke daily ( 39 40 41 Systemic barriers, including a reactive funding model, under-served regions, and limited integration of prevention undermine population access to routine care. Aged care residents and incarcerated individuals are disproportionately affected ( 24 42 43 Population dynamics and workforce distribution Tasmania's estimated population was 575,496 in mid-2024, growing slowly at 0.31% annually ( 44 45 46 47 48 49 These demographic trends suggest that demand for health services, including dental care, will continue to rise, particularly among older adults. Yet this growth has not been matched by proportional increases in the oral health workforce, especially outside of metropolitan areas. Professional dental workforce According to the National Rural Health Alliance, Tasmania has the lowest dental practitioner density in Australia, with only 26.5 dental practitioners per 100,000 residents which is far below the national average of 72.5 per 100,000 ( 50 51 In June 2023, there were 19,179 registered dentists nationally, with the women entering the profession increasing to 52.4% up from 43.5% in 2018/19 ( 52 53 In contrast, dental hygienists, therapists, and oral health therapists (5,314 practitioners) make up 10.8% of the dental workforce and 0.6% of the total regulated health workforce with stronger rural presence including 7.8% practising in regional areas and 7.3% in large rural towns ( 54 55 Practitioner density remained low in Tasmania, whereas South Australia (39.7) and Western Australia (29.1) showed comparatively higher ratios (AHPRA, 2024). Encouragingly, this group has grown by 14.5% over the past five years, with the greatest gains in large rural and inner regional areas, aligning with SDG 3: Target 3.c, which calls for investment in and equitable distribution of the health workforce ( 56 By December 2024, the total number of registered dental practitioners in Australia rose to 28,677, comprising 25,454 with general registration, 1,882 with both general and specialist registration, 74 with specialist registration, 59 with limited registration, and 1,205 with non-practising registration ( 57 58 Meanwhile, the dental services industry generated $10.9 billion in revenue in 2022–23, employing 56,810 jobs across 19,119 businesses ( 58 58 Most dental services are privately funded, with $2.9 billion in private health insurance benefits paid for 44.8 million services in 2021–22 ( 58 59 Despite trends toward corporatisation of practices, access to dental care in regional Tasmania remains limited due to a thin and uneven workforce, infrastructure constraints, and restricted public funding. These factors collectively pose a challenge to achieving equitable oral health outcomes and underscore the urgency of targeted workforce development initiatives in underserved regions. Workforce scope and strategic use of Oral Health Therapists (OHTs) in Tasmania Although limited empirical evidence links the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) directly to dental workforce distribution, they provide a strategic framework to guide policy and investment decisions. In Tasmania, where access disparities persist, aligning workforce development with the SDGs offers a promising path forward. The oral health workforce in Tasmania includes several regulated professional categories under the Dental Board of Australia (DBA) ( 60 “Oral health therapists have qualifications in both dental therapy and dental hygiene. They can assess, diagnose, treat, manage, and prevent oral disease. Their scope includes restorative procedures, fillings, extractions, periodontal care, and broader oral health promotion across all age groups.” Evidence from international contexts shows that dental therapists and oral health therapists (OHTs) can improve oral health access and outcomes in underserved populations. For example, deployment of dental therapists in Alaska Native communities has been linked to increased preventive care, improved access, and reductions in extractions and emergency dental visits ( 61 62 In Tasmania, OHTs are well-suited for workforce deployment models such as those implemented by Oral Health Services Tasmania (OHST), where they are more commonly employed in underserved areas than dentists. This strategy aligns with SDG3: Target 3.c, which promotes increased health workforce investment and more equitable distribution of healthcare providers. The process advances SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) by addressing persistent gaps in access for rural and remote populations. The deployment of OHTs in rural areas also supports SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by strengthening the health resilience of these communities. Workforce sustainability of OHTs is concerning with national average age of OHTs at 43.5 years, with Tasmania showing a higher proportion of practitioners aged 50 and over ( 56 Aboriginal and torres strait islander dental workforce The National Health Workforce Dataset (NHWDS) provides insights into the low but growing representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander professionals in Australia's health workforce ( 63 64 65 Although representation remains low, initiatives show the potential of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce participation to deliver culturally safe care. Aboriginal dental assistants have been trained to safely apply fluoride varnish in regional, rural, and remote schools, improving preventive care and access for children ( 66 67 These developments support SDG 3 and SDG 10 by improving access and equity, while also advancing SDG 4 (Quality Education) through strengthened training pathways. Efforts to strengthen Indigenous representation reflect the importance of cultural safety ( 68 69 Why are dental practitioners not going rural? A rural background and rural training are strong predictors of rural practice. Graduates from rural areas are significantly more likely to return to these regions ( 70 72 73 74 75 While some practitioners value the rural lifestyle and community connection, financial and lifestyle incentives continue to favour urban practice ( 76 77 78 79 Ongoing revision and renewal of national strategies for rural dental training is needed to improve access and workforce distribution ( 80 Expanding and retaining the rural dental workforce directly supports SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Strengthening rural health workforce contributes to local economies, improves access to essential services, and supports sustainable development. It also reinforces broader goals around equity, resilience, and sustainable community development. Policy and systems implications Tasmania presents a strong case for why more empirical evidence is needed to evaluate progress towards the key SDGs identified in this perspective on oral health. Despite promising policy shifts and workforce innovations, it remains unclear to what extent current strategies are advancing these global goals in practice over time. Research is urgently required to assess real-world outcomes, track progress against equity and sustainability indicators, and inform future investment. Guided by the National Rural Health Alliance (NRHA) ( 50 We recommend more actionable, specific policy measures including; expanding rural training pathways and recruiting students from rural backgrounds to address maldistribution; providing early, practical rural placements to foster long-term retention and improve cultural competence in care delivery; aligning dental policy with universal health coverage principles to ensure to ensure equitable, lifelong access; standardising and strengthening financial, relocation, and career progression incentives to make rural practice more attractive; and guaranteeing access to continuing professional development and mentorship opportunities. Embedding oral health in interprofessional education and integrating dental services within primary health teams, particularly in community settings can strengthen care as seen across multiple settings. Flexible, community-based models like the Primary Care Rural Integrated Multidisciplinary Health Services (PRIM-HS) offer more sustainable solutions ( 81 Future policy directions must prioritise sustained funding for research, implementation, and evaluation of community-integrated oral health programs to ensure evidence-based approaches are scalable, equitable, and responsive to Tasmania's changing demographic and environmental contexts. Conclusion Tasmania's oral health system faces ongoing challenges: workforce shortages, service inequities regional disparities, and rising preventable disease. Innovative partnerships such as those with the Royal Flying Doctor Service and public–private collaborations may alleviate some pressures. However, gaps remain, particularly in preventive care and equitable access. This perspective underscores the relevance of nine Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in guiding equitable and sustainable oral health reform in Tasmania. By aligning with global priorities, particularly around prevention, education, workforce development, infrastructure, climate resilience, and partnerships, islands can build a more inclusive and effective oral health system. Realising this vision will require ongoing collaboration, policy innovation, and a commitment to data-driven action to ensure that no community is left behind.
