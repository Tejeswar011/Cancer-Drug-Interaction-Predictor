Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the inflammatory form of MAFLD, can progress to more severe forms including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and even liver-related death [ 1 2 3 Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) attach to hydrophobic molecules like long-chain fatty acids, which plays vital roles in modulating inflammation response and lipid transport [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 −/− 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 1 1 12 12 4 db/db 12 4 Materials and methods Chemistry All target compounds were synthesized based on commercial chemicals, solvents and materials, and the reaction process was monitored by thin layer chromatography. 1 13 In vitro FABP1 inhibitory activity assay The FABP1 inhibitory activity of target compounds was performed according to the previous report by Kane and Ber [ 17 50 Docking study For docking study, the structure of FABP1 protein was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 6DRG), which was further prepared by AutoDockTools (version 1.5.6). Then the configuration of the grid box was established based on the original cocrystal ligand GW7647, and the molecular docking was performed by Autodock Vina (Version 1.1.2). Finally, the protein-ligand configurations were visualized by PyMOL (Version 2.5.0). Cell culture The LX-2 (Hepatic stellate cell, HSC), HRMC (Renal mesangial cell), and NHCF-V (Cardiac fibroblast) cell lines were provided by Novo Nordisk. LX-2 (20,000 cells/well), HRMC (6000 cells/well) and NHCF-V (5000 cells/well) were seeded in 96 well plates (poly-L-lysin coated) in 2% FBS complete medium and incubated 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 12 2 Animals Male db/db Chronic administration in WD + CCl 4 Eight weeks old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into six groups ( n 4 4 18 12 Chronic administration in MCD diet-fed db/db mice Eight weeks old male C57BL/6 mice fed with a standard chow diet were set as normal control ( n db/db n 12 Chronic administration in CCl 4 Eight weeks old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups ( n 4 12 Serum and liver biochemistry analyses Plasma parameters, including aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) were determined using the automatic biochemical analyzer (Beckman Coulter, AU5811, Tokyo, Japan). Total Cholesterol Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng, A111-1-1), triglyceride Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng, A110-1-1), non-esterified fatty acid kit (Nanjing Jiancheng, A042-2-1) and hydroxyproline kit (Nanjing Jiancheng, A030-2-1) were applied for quantification of liver TC, TG, NEFA and hydroxyproline levels following manufacturer’s protocols. Liver histopathology and immunohistochemistry 10% formalin-fixed liver sections were embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome staining in accordance with standard protocols. The MAFLD activity score (NAS) of each mouse was evaluated by a histopathologist blinded to mouse treatment and group designations (Samples with scores > 5 was designated as “MASH”, and samples with scores < 3 were designated as “Not MASH”) [ 19 Morphometry analysis of adipose tissues The white adipose tissues (WAT) and brown adipose tissues (BAT) of model group, GFT505 treated group and compound 12 treated group were isolated immediately after sacrifice and washed with ice-cold saline before fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin. The sections were embedded in paraffin after dehydrate. Four-micron sections were cut and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin for histopathological assessment at 400 × magnification. The deparaffinized sections of WAT from each mouse were exposed to mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) actin antibody (Servicebio, Cat# GB112174 Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Total RNA was isolated from LX-2, HRMC, NHCF-V cell lysates, or mouse liver using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). The complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared with ReverTra Ace reverse transcriptase (TOYOBO, Japan, FSQ-301). Real-time RT-PCR was carried out by the SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO, Japan, QPK-201). The results were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt Statistical analysis All data were expressed as mean ± SD and analyzed by GraphPad 7 Software. The one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison post hoc test was used to detect a difference of each group.
