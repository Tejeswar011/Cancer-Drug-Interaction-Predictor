As survival into adulthood increases, there is an urgent need to refine strategies for long-term follow-up and the early detection of Fontan-related sequelae. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current evidence regarding the use of circulating blood biomarkers as non-invasive tools for assessing and monitoring Fontan physiology. We critically analyzed available studies investigating serum biomarkers related to key pathological mechanisms associated with Fontan failure, encompassing not only cardiac dysfunction but also systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, hepatic and renal impairment, and altered bone metabolism. Several biomarkers have shown promise in reflecting global systemic impairments as well as end-organ involvement in Fontan patients. However, current data are insufficient to support evidence-based clinical recommendations for standardized specific biomarkers, mainly due to the small sample sizes, heterogeneous patient populations, and limited longitudinal data in the available studies. Only a large-scale, prospective, multi-center, and multidisciplinary research will permit us to identify a panel of specific biomarkers of clinical utility in this population. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches could be applied to integrate all these heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, “omics”-based studies, including proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and microRNA profiling, hold great potential for uncovering novel biomarkers and pathophysiological pathways, ultimately paving the way for precision medicine in the management of Fontan patients.

Introduction The functionally single ventricle represents the most complex congenital heart defect (CHD), affecting roughly 1 in 10,000 individuals [ 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 5 The Fontan operation, first described in 1971 for repairing tricuspid atresia [ 4 6 7 3 The term Fontan “failure”, referring to the physiological dysfunction resulting from chronically elevated central venous pressure (CVP) and reduced cardiac output (CO) [ 8 9 Figure 1 Therefore, there is a dual need: on one hand, to identify biomarkers capable of detecting early signs of Fontan circulatory failure; on the other, to determine biomarkers associated with the onset and progression of multiorgan dysfunction. This approach is essential to optimize follow-up strategies and improve the management of long-term complications in this unique population [ 7 In 2019, the AHA Scientific Statement highlighted a critical gap in characterizing Fontan pathophysiology and proposed a cardiovascular surveillance testing scheme to drive the clinical decision-making [ 3 3 The 2020 ESC guidelines on adult congenital heart disease stated that catheterization should be considered early in the presence of clinical deterioration, such as reduced exercise capacity, unexplained edema, new-onset arrhythmia, cyanosis, or hemoptysis [ 1 3 In recent years, several studies have evaluated several biomarkers not only strictly associated with cardiovascular impairment but also involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to global body failure in different cohorts of patients with Fontan circulation, seeking correlations with adverse clinical outcomes [ 5 This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the principal circulating biomarkers investigated in post-Fontan patients, with a particular focus on their clinical significance and prognostic value ( Figure 2 2. Pathophysiological Pathways Reflected by Circulating Biomarkers A biomarker is generally defined as a “characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention” [ 10 11 12 In this section, we summarize the principal studies performed in cohorts of post-Fontan patients, presenting the available evidence in alignment with the key pathophysiological pathways that are currently recognized as being involved in, or altered during, the development and progression of Fontan failure. A more detailed discussion can be found in previous reviews by Rajpal et al. (2017) [ 13 5 2.1. Hemodynamic Stress and Cellular Injury Fontan failure encompasses a diverse range of clinical presentations, including heart failure (HF) and/or portal hypertension, which often necessitate Fontan revision or heart transplantation [ 5 5 2.1.1. BNP and NT-proBNP Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a polypeptide hormone synthesized, stored, and secreted by cardiac muscle cells, plays a major role in many pathophysiological processes. Its blood levels have been shown to be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of cardiac dysfunction and/or heart failure [ 14 15 The scientific statement of the American Heart Association on the “Evaluation and Management of the Child and Adult with Fontan Circulation” highly recommend the evaluation of serum BNP or NT-proBNP levels once in childhood, every 1–3 years in adolescents, and every 1–2 years in adults [ 3 3 1 16 In 2004, Ohuchi et al. first identified the serum concentration of BNP as an independent factor able to classify patients according to NYHA class II and III/IV [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 22 n 23 23 24 NT-proBNP resulted in drastically high levels in pediatric Fontan patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), and a strong correlation with the severity of disease was observed. Fontan patients without CHF had NT-proBNP levels similar to healthy children [ 25 25 NT-proBNP was found to be a fundamental marker for the identification of patients with significant ventricular dilation or dysfunction [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 28 32 32 Recently, Buendía Fuentes et al. (2023) investigated the role of NT-proBNP and several other biomarkers with respect to clinical complications in a prospective study involving 66 Fontan patients [ 33 33 34 2.1.2. Troponins Troponins are essential regulatory proteins involved in the contractile apparatus of striated and cardiac muscle that are released into the bloodstream in response to myocardial injury. Hence, they serve as sensitive and specific biomarkers of cardiac damage [ 35 36 5 37 2.1.3. The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) A number of studies investigated the role of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) that represents a key endocrine/paracrine network modulating some cardiovascular functions [ 38 38 16 39 40 40 41 2.1.4. Galectin-3 Emerging evidence indicates that Gal-3 may serve as a biomarker of cardiac disease, including myocardial dysfunction and acute HF [ 42 43 43 43 31 2.2. Inflammation Inflammation is the body’s natural defense mechanism against injury or infection and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, including HF [ 44 45 46 2.2.1. C-Reactive Protein C-reactive protein (CRP) is a pentameric protein synthesized by the liver in response to inflammation. In the clinical setting, CRP functions as an acute-phase reactant, primarily induced by IL-6 acting on the hepatic gene responsible for CRP transcription during inflammatory or infectious processes [ 47 48 49 2.2.2. Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) After the Fontan procedure, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α, have been found elevated [ 49 50 51 51 52 53 18 Saraf et al. (2020), in addition to elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, found that GDF-15 (growth/differentiation factor-15), a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) cytokine superfamily, was significantly increased in Fontan patients with clinical events [ 52 52 54 32 32 32 2.3. Endothelial Dysfunction Endothelial dysfunction appears to be a consistent feature across all stages of single ventricle CHD palliation, although the precise timing of its onset remains unclear. Abnormal endothelial function has been documented in Fontan patients and has been associated with impaired cardiac output during orthostatic stress testing [ 55 56 2.3.1. Endothelin-1 Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a peptide primarily produced by endothelial cells of blood vessels and cardiomyocytes, has prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory effects with a pivotal role in the development of various cardiovascular diseases. Evidence has highlighted high ET-1 concentration in the blood of Fontan patients [ 57 58 59 60 29 1 2.3.2. Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a large multimeric glycoprotein produced mainly by endothelial cells. It has a major role in facilitating platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury, and in transporting coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the bloodstream [ 61 62 63 31 2.3.3. Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), competes with L-arginine at the active site of eNOS and promotes endothelial cell apoptosis. Increased ADMA levels were found to be associated with endothelial dysfunction in both healthy individuals and those with cardiovascular disease [ 64 65 66 2.4. End-Organ Involvement: Hepatic Congestion and Fibrosis The passive venous return directly into the pulmonary circulation increases arterial oxygen saturation, leading to a significant rise in CVP. All that results in several extracardiac consequences. including the Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) that has emerged as a notable comorbidity of Fontan circulation [ 67 68 69 70 71 Diagnosis of FALD is challenging due to the absence of reliable physical exam findings, relatively normal laboratory values, and the lack of pathognomonic imaging features, and liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis [ 71 68 69 71 2.4.1. Bilirubin, GGT, AST and ALT Regarding the more classical liver parameters such as bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), evidence shows that FALD differs from other hepatic diseases, including viral hepatitis. In Fontan patients, the increase in AST and ALT is usually mild, while GGT or total bilirubin levels are often increased [ 72 72 73 74 74 2.4.2. Hepatocyte Growth Factor Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a mesenchymal cytokine with a pivotal role in the development of various epithelial and endothelial cells, is released after endothelial injury [ 75 76 77 77 2.4.3. Suppression of Tumorigenicity 2 The suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) is a protein involved in a number of pathophysiological processes, especially related to inflammatory and autoimmune disease [ 78 79 80 In patients with Fontan circulation, sST2 levels were among the most critical predictors of acute heart failure [ 81 31 82 32 2.4.4. Cholesterol Metabolism Evidence reported that hypocholesterolemia (defined as lipoprotein levels below the fifth percentile of the general population adjusted for age, sex, and race) is commonly found in patients with Fontan circulation [ 83 84 85 85 84 85 85 86 87 87 2.4.5. Glucose Metabolism The exact pathophysiology of abnormal glucose metabolism in Fontan patients is incompletely understood, and it is not excluded that it may have different causes, including myopenia, since skeletal muscle is a major consumer of plasma glucose. However, evidence suggests that hepatic dysfunction might largely contribute to the abnormalities in glucose homeostasis observed in Fontan patients [ 88 89 88 88 2.5. End-Organ Involvement: Renal Dysfunction As the Fontan population continues to grow, cardiorenal syndrome has emerged as a significant yet often underrecognized complication, reflecting the complex bidirectional interplay between cardiac and renal dysfunction [ 90 90 90 Cystatin C and Creatinine Renal dysfunction (defined as an eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 90 91 Cystatin C is a 13-kilodalton protein, constantly produced by all nucleated cells, filtered at the glomerulus, and metabolized in the proximal tubule. Cystatin C-based eGFR resulted significantly lower in the Fontan group compared with healthy controls and was associated with adverse outcomes (while creatinine-based estimates are not) [ 92 93 94 2.6. End-Organ Involvement: Bone (dys)Metabolism Patients with Fontan palliation may have decreased bone formation and/or increased bone resorption, resulting in bone loss and ultimately osteoporosis due to low cardiac output and chronic, albeit mild hypoxia [ 95 2.6.1. Vitamin D Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in a few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis from 7-dehydrocholesterol or are ingested from food. Then, it must be activated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-vitamin D) and finally to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] [ 96 97 98 99 100 98 101 2 102 2.6.2. Parathyroid Hormone Calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the blood is primarily regulated by the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands secrete the parathyroid hormone (PTH), a polypeptide, in response to low blood calcium levels. PTH promotes the production of active vitamin D in the kidneys. Together with vitamin D, PTH regulates calcium and phosphate balance by acting on bones, kidneys, and the small intestine. When serum calcium levels decrease, PTH secretion increases; conversely, elevated calcium levels trigger a negative feedback mechanism that suppresses PTH release. The regulation of calcium by PTH is complex, and disruptions in this system can have important clinical consequences. Elevated levels of PTH were independently associated with a higher risk of HF in the general population [ 103 99 104 100 100 95 95 2.7. Systemic Metabolism and Stress Response Patients with Fontan circulation frequently exhibit alterations in systemic metabolism and stress-related pathways, reflecting the chronic hemodynamic burden and multisystem nature of the Fontan physiology. Alterations in systemic metabolism as well as the response to different stresses largely influence the general homeostasis, leading to a series of disturbances, including endothelial dysfunction and progressive end-organ alterations. 2.7.1. Red Blood Cell Distribution Width Anemia is particularly common in patients with complex CHD and ventricular dysfunction, especially those with Fontan, physiology which has been associated with increased mortality [ 105 The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of variation in the erythrocyte size (anisocytosis), automatically calculated in a standard complete blood count test (as the ratio between the standard deviation of the erythrocyte volume and the mean corpuscular volume). Higher values have been associated with higher mortality in heart failure [ 106 62 62 107 2.7.2. Adrenomedullin The peptide hormone, adrenomedullin (ADM), has a pivotal role in vasodilatation as well as in the maintenance of endothelial function [ 108 59 59 109 110 2.7.3. Uric Acid Serum uric acid (UA), the final metabolite of purine metabolism, has been closely associated with cardiovascular diseases. Uric acid causes inflammation and increases oxidative stress in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, contributing to endothelial dysfunction [ 111 112 17 2.7.4. Norepinephrine Norepinephrine (NE), one of the primary endogenous catecholamines released by the adrenal medulla as well as the central and sympathetic nervous systems, may act as a hormone and neurotransmitter. NE plays a critical role in modulating cardiovascular homeostasis [ 113 114 16 39 115 2 40 17 3. Methodological Challenges of Biomarker Research in the Fontan Population This review has outlined the available evidence on serum biomarkers in Fontan circulation, evaluating their association with specific pathophysiological sequelae. While numerous biomarkers have been proposed to characterize the pathophysiological complexity of the Fontan circulation, only a limited subset currently holds potential for clinical application. The interpretation of a role for a specific biomarker in the Fontan population is challenged by several methodological limitations. First, most available investigations are based on small, single-center cohorts, often with wide age ranges and heterogeneous surgical histories, which hinder reproducibility and generalizability. Second, study designs are predominantly cross-sectional, thereby limiting the ability to establish temporal relationships between fluctuations in biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Longitudinal studies that might allow the evaluation of temporal changes within the same population, offering a greater insight into disease course and supporting causal inference, remain scarce. Third, variability in laboratory methods and cutoff values further complicates the comparison of results across different cohorts. Altogether, these methodological variables may explain the multiple discrepancies between studies. In addition, clinical endpoints are inconsistently defined, ranging from surrogate measures of Fontan physiology to composite adverse outcomes, making it difficult to identify robust predictors. Finally, confounding factors such as medication use, comorbidities, and age-related changes in biomarker expression are often underreported or not adequately controlled. Addressing these methodological challenges will be crucial to advancing the field toward reliable, evidence-based biomarker applications in clinical practice. 4. Future Perspectives 4.1. From Single Biomarkers to an Integrated Biomarker Panel The only biomarker recommended by current clinical guidelines is BNP/NT-proBNP [ 3 80 116 Figure 3 In 2022, a study by Truong et al. [ 117 117 4.2. The Emerging “-omics” Technologies In addition to conventional biomarkers, emerging “-omics” technologies—including proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and miRNome—could offer exciting new avenues for understanding Fontan pathophysiology ( Figure 3 These platforms enable the identification of biomolecular patterns that reflect metabolic, inflammatory, and vascular dysfunctions long before overt clinical manifestations occur. For instance, in an initial clinical metabolomics investigation examining serum amino acid profiles in Fontan patients, adult individuals with Fontan circulation demonstrated a dysregulated amino acid metabolome compared to healthy controls [ 64 64 118 To further investigate the lipid and lipoprotein imbalance observed in Fontan circulation, the same cohort of patients was analyzed for small organic molecules within extended phospholipid and acylcarnitine metabolic pathways [ 87 119 120 120 Novel insights might also emerge from the analysis of the miRNome—the complete profile of microRNA (miRNA) profiling—in Fontan patients. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and play key roles in various biological processes, including inflammation, fibrosis, metabolism, and cardiac remodeling [ 121 122 Moosmann et al. (2021) reported that PLE in Fontan patients was associated with pronounced immunological disturbances, including severe lymphopenia, T cell deficiency, marked alterations in T cell differentiation, and an increased frequency of regulatory T cells [ 123 123 123 124 124 These findings underscore the potential of “omics”- based approaches not only to identify novel early biomarkers, but also to uncover previously unrecognized pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the diverse complications seen in Fontan circulation. This mechanistic insight could pave the way for the development of targeted therapies, ultimately improving outcomes for this complex and vulnerable patient population. Continued investment in large-scale, collaborative, multi “-omics” research is essential to move the field from descriptive studies toward precision medicine in the management of Fontan physiology. 5. Conclusions The growing interest in identifying biomarkers for the progression of Fontan physiology reflects an increasing awareness within the cardiology community of the challenges posed by this unique and complex population. The investigations conducted thus far represent only a fraction of the potential biomarkers that may prove useful for risk stratification, early detection of complications, and individualized management. However, while these initial findings are promising, the field must now move beyond exploratory analyses. There is a pressing need for prospective, longitudinal, and multicenter studies to rigorously validate candidate biomarkers and clarify their role in clinical decision-making. As the Fontan population ages and long-term complications become more prevalent, it is essential that research strategies evolve accordingly. Importantly, given the multisystem nature of Fontan-associated pathophysiology—affecting not only the heart but also other organs—future studies should be multidisciplinary in design. Such research should not be confined solely to the domain of cardiology but should actively involve hepatologists, nephrologists, hematologists, and other relevant specialists. A collaborative, integrative approach will be crucial to fully understanding the complex interactions between organ systems in Fontan patients and to developing effective, holistic strategies for surveillance and treatment. Only through this interdisciplinary effort can we hope to improve long-term outcomes and quality of life for this growing patient population.

This figure was partially created using BioRender ( https://www.biorender.com/ Figure 2 Schematic representation of circulating biomarkers associated with major potential complications related to Fontan failure, including cardiac and circulatory dysfunction (hemodynamic stress and cellular injury-associated biomarkers), hepatic congestion and fibrosis, renal dysfunction, bone (dys)metabolism, vascular/endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, as well as biomarkers linked to systemic metabolism and stress response. Cardiac dysfunction is strictly associated with abnormal levels of BNP/NT-proBNP–the only biomarker highly recommended in the management of Fontan patients by current guidelines [ 3 https://www.biorender.com/ Figure 3 Schematic representation of the progressive evolution in biomarker-based monitoring strategies for patients with Fontan circulation. The pyramid structure illustrates three conceptual levels. Level 1(base): current clinical practice relies primarily on conventional biomarkers such as BNP and NT-proBNP, as well as standard imaging techniques, which lack sensitivity for early detection and have no standardized cut-off values specific to this population. Level 2: emerging candidate biomarkers, including RDW, cystatin C, hs-CRP, CA125, GDF-15, might enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy if investigated in longitudinal, multicenter studies. Level 3: Artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches will integrate heterogeneous datasets, i.e., circulating biomarkers and clinical/imaging data, with the goal of improving risk stratification and outcome prediction in complex conditions. Level 4 (apex): future perspectives involve multi-“omics” approaches such as proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and microRNA profiling (miRNome), which offer promising opportunities to identify novel biomarkers, reveal previously unrecognized pathophysiological mechanisms, and support the development of precision medicine strategies tailored to the unique and complex Fontan population. BNP: brain natriuretic peptide; NT-proBNP: N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide; RDW: red blood cell distribution width; hs-CRP: high sensitive C-reactive protein; CA125: carbohydrate antigen 125; GDF-15: Growth/differentiation factor-15.
