Exposure to zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) is more likely due to their wide utilization in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. Therefore, serum neuromarkers and hippocampal tissue were examined for the potential prophylactic impact of folic acid in four groups of rats, each consisting of 10 animals. The first group had 150 mg/kg ZnONPs orally every day for 2 weeks. The second group received 10 mg/kg of folic acid intraperitoneal (ip) for 1 week, followed by ZnONPs daily for 2 weeks. The third group received folic acid only, while the control group was given distilled water. At the end of the experiments, hippocampi were examined, and serum concentrations were measured for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), and neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL). ZnONPs-exposed animals exhibited significantly lower levels of GFAP and MBP ( p p p Keywords glial fibrillary acid protein monoamine oxidase A myelin basic protein neurofilament light chain neuronal biomarkers Deanship of Research, Jordan University of Science and Technology 20200132 The Deanship of Research at JUST supported this research project financially (grant number 20200132). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) have a molecular weight of 81.38 g/mol and are known for their white color and absence of odor [ 1 1 Annually, the worldwide production of ZnONPs is approximately ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 million tons [ 2 2+ 3 2 The existing research on the potential toxic effects of ZnONPs has highlighted their cytotoxic effects, including alterations in cell viability, disruptions in cytoskeletal structure, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), using in vitro cell culture models. However, there are a scarcity of data concerning their toxicity on the genetic material, the nervous system, embryonic development, and other related areas [ 2 While many studies have examined the neurotoxic effects of ZnONPs at the molecular and cellular levels, currently, there is no research on the protective role of folic acid in mitigating the neurotoxicity of these nanoparticles. A previous study has demonstrated that supplementation with quercetin can alleviate cerebellar neurotoxicity induced by ZnONPs [ 4 5 Folic acid, or called vitamin B9, is an essential B-vitamin that is a critical substance for the development and functioning of the nervous system. It is essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA, which maintain integrity of cells, including nerve cells [ 6 6 Research reported that folic acid can mitigate the neurotoxic effects caused by lead exposure in young rat offspring [ 7 The present study examined the potential neurotoxic effect of ZnONPs on adult rats and assessed folic acid protective effect. This was achieved by analyzing four neuronal biomarkers in serum: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), myelin basic protein (MBP), and neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL). In addition, hippocampi from rats were examined for histopathological changes. The selected biomarkers as well as neuronal tissue serve as key indicators of the effects of ZnONPs on the nervous system and the potential protective properties of folic acid. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethical Use of Animals The animal experiments followed ethical guidelines outlined in the National Guide for the Animal Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) with the approval number 18/2/3/16. The national guidelines are in accordance with Guidance on the operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and associated guidelines. All necessary precautions were taken to ensure laboratory health and safety during the experimental procedures described in this study. 2.2. Animal Housing and Acclimatization Conditions Forty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, 12 weeks and weighing between 248 and 295 g, were divided into four groups of 10 and housed in the Animal Care Unit. An assigned veterinarian monitored the health of the rats throughout the study. The rats were given 1 week to adapt after being transferred to stainless-steel wire cages and a bedding of hardwood chips. They had free access to water and standard chow. The temperature of the experimental room was maintained at approximately 25 ± 2°C and humidity of 26% with a twelve-hour light: dark cycle. 2.3. ZnONPs and Folic Acid Treatment Protocols Four groups of rats were treated as the following: The first group received distilled water for 1 week, followed by a daily oral administration of 150 mg/kg body weight of ZnONPs for 2 weeks. The second group received an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 10 mg/kg folic acid for 1 week prior to the ZnONPs treatment, which continued for 2 weeks. The third group received folic acid for 1 week and then distilled water for 2 weeks. The control group received only distilled water for the 3-week duration of the study. All doses were freshly prepared in distilled water upon administration to the rats. The doses were adjusted from previous studies on ZnONPs [ 8 9 7 2.4. Processing of Samples About 2 mL of blood samples were taken retro-orbitally by the end of the experiment [ 10 11 2.5. Measuring GFAP, MAOA, MBP, and NEFL Using ELISA The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure the neuro biomarkers GFAP, MAOA, MBP, and NEFL. For this purpose, rat ELISA kit was purchased from MyBioSource, USA (GFAP MBS2505953; MAOA MBS2703950; MBP MBS450557; and NEFL MBS763661). Optimum serum dilution was determined following a pilot run that was conducted for the three kits using 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:9 sample dilutions. Based on this, the dilution of 1:9 was selected for all assays except NEFL, which required 1:2 dilution. Based on the instructions provided by the manufacturer [ 12 A total of 50 μL per each serum sample was placed in a well of a 96-microwell plate, followed by the addition of 40 μL of diluent per well. Then, 100 μL of each kit specific conjugated antibodies was added to each well and incubated for 60 min at 37°C (GFAP and MAOA), and 90 min for MBP and NEFL. After incubation, the wells were washed three times with washing solution and tapped gently against a paper towel. Each kit substrate solution was then added to each well and incubated in a dark place at 37°C for 15 min for GFAP and MAOA, while MBP required 30 min, and NEFL required 20 min. After incubation, stop solution was added to each well, changing the color from blue to yellow. Samples were processed in triplicates and measured at 450 nm wavelength using the microplate reader Multiskan Go spectrophotometer (model 1510, Thermo Fisher, UK). 2.6. Histopathological Examination and Semiquantitative Scoring The hippocampi from two rats per group were preserved in 10% formalin. The samples were then sectioned into 4 μm slices using an HM 325 rotary microtome (Thermo Scientific, USA). Section processing followed a previously established protocol [ 13 14 Semiquantitative scoring of tissue was adopted with modification from a previously published protocol [ 15 Table 1 2.7. Statistical Analysis of Data The data were calculated as mean ± standard deviation (M ± SD) [ 16 17 18 10 19 p 3. Results 3.1. Measurements of GFAP, MAOA, MBP, and NEFL The average levels of serum GFAP were measured in the four different groups of rats: ZnONPs overdosed rats, rats with folic acid prior to ZnONPs overdose, rats treated with folic acid only, and control rats given distilled water. The concentration of serum GFAP was found 1.53 ± 0.14 pg/mL in ZnONPs overdosed rats, 1.81 ± 0.30 pg/mL in rats with folic acid prophylaxis, 1.61 ± 0.30 pg/mL in rats treated with folic acid only, and 1.58 ± 0.37 pg/mL in control rats. The animals without prophylaxis showed significantly lower levels of serum GFAP compared to the animals with prophylaxis, as well as the animals treated with folic acid only and the control animals ( p Figure 1 The mean concentration of serum MAOA was 8.16 ± 0.54 U/mL in the rats exposed to an overdose of ZnONPs, while rats that received folic acid prophylaxis had a lower mean concentration of 5.25 ± 1.99 U/mL. The group that received folic acid treatment alone had a mean concentration of 4.32 ± 1.56 U/mL, while the control had a mean concentration of 4.46 ± 1.26 U/mL. The rats without folic acid prophylaxis had significantly higher levels of serum MAOA compared to all other groups, including the control group ( p Figure 2 The mean concentrations of serum MBP were found 1.62 ± 0.68 ng/mL in rats exposed to ZnONPs overdose, 5.02 ± 3.49 ng/mL in rats with prophylaxis, 5.72 ± 3.53 ng/mL in rats treated with folic acid only, and 3.72 ± 3.02 ng/mL in the control group. The rats exposed to ZnONPs without folic acid prophylaxis had significantly lower levels of serum MBP compared to rats with prophylaxis, rats treated with folic acid only, and the control group ( p Figure 3 The average concentrations of serum NEFL were measured at 76.50 ± 22.34 pg/mL in ZnONPs intoxicated rats, 84.94 ± 27.13 pg/mL in rats with prophylaxis, 78.20 ± 20.62 pg/mL in rats treated with folic acid only, and 80.60 ± 32.54 pg/mL in the control group. Statistical analysis showed that there were no significant differences in NEFL levels between all groups. For a visual presentation of the NEFL levels in the serum of rats, please refer to Figure 4 3.2. Histopathological Findings The dentate gyrus was examined across the four experimental groups, revealing distinct histopathological alterations, which are illustrated in Figure 5  Figure 6 Tissue from folic + ZnONPs group versus tissue from ZnONPs group revealed significant reduction in all pathology parameters, supporting folic acid's protective role. Control samples provided baseline for distinguishing ZnONP-induced effects from natural variability. Folic acid supplementation alone did not significantly alter granule cell morphology compared to controls, confirming that observed neuroprotection in the folic + ZnONPs group was not due to artifactual changes.

Discussion To address the increasing use and advantages of ZnONPs, it is important to conduct a thorough investigation to elucidate the biological consequences arising from exposure to these nanoparticles. One of these possible consequences is neurotoxicity, which is the negative impact on the nervous system due to exposure to toxic substances [ 20 GFAP is considered as an indicator of astroglial activation and astrocytosis [ 21 21 22 21 21 22 23 21 24 MAOA is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of amine neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin [ 25 25 26 MBP is a critical component of the myelin sheath, which is a protective layer that surrounds and insulates axons. Damage or deficiency to the myelin sheath can result in axonal loss and severe demyelination diseases [ 27 28 29 Regarding NEFL in the serum, it can serve as an indicator of neuronal cell death in the brain and can be used as a good biomarker of neurotoxicity because neurofilaments are released when the axon of a neuron is damaged [ 30 31 24 Histopathological findings revealed that ZnONPs induced neuronal damage in the dentate gyrus part of hippocampus, including shrinkage, vacuolation, and cell death. These findings are consistent with those of a previous study, which reported that ZnONPs induced incomplete neural tube closure through various cell death modes, including neuronal apoptosis and autophagy [ 32 33 34 5. Conclusions This study examined the neurotoxicity resulting from excessive oral exposure to ZnONPs in rats and evaluated the potential protective effect of folic acid. The research assessed the impact by analyzing the levels of four neuronal biomarkers (GFAP, MAOA, MBP, and NEFL) in rats' serum. The findings indicated that ZnONPs had detrimental effects on all the evaluated biomarkers, except for NEFL. Furthermore, ZnONPs induced neuronal damage in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus while folic acid prophylaxis partially ameliorated tissue toxicity, preserving some neuronal structure. Overall, the administration of folic acid as a preventative measure reduced the toxicity of ZnONPs. These findings inspire future research to explore alternative biomarkers of neurotoxicity caused by nanoparticles to enhance our understanding of their mechanism and develop more efficient preventive strategies against their toxicity.

The cytoplasm contains prominent basophilic cytoplasmic Nissl's granules and is surrounded by thin neuropil. The dentate gyrus contains 3 layers from left to right, the molecular layer (M), the granule cell layer (G), and the polymorphic layer or called the hilus (P). All identified features (e.g., arrows/circles) are reference established in Bancroft's Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques. Sections were stained by H&E and examined at x400. Scale bars represent 100 μm at 400 magnification and 500 μm at 100× magnification. Figure 6 A schematic diagram illustrating the overall procedure and significant discoveries of this research.
