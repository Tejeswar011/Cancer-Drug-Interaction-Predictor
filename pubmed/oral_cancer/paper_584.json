Objectives: To investigate the salivary BDNF’s ability to act as a potential biomarker for detecting the risk of developing EDs among young females. Design and methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Amman, Jordan, with a total of 216 nutrition students completing the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) to assess the risk of developing EDs, the Cohens’ Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) to measure stress levels, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) to assess physical activity levels. Dietary intake was analyzed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. A nested sample of 34 females from both extreme EDs was selected and tested for salivary BDNF levels. Results: The nested sample of 34 female nutrition students 22.00 (2.75) years old with body mass index (BMI) of 23.60 (3.35) kg/m 2 p Conclusion: BDNF is not a robust biomarker of risk for EDs. The changes in salivary BDNF levels could reflect individual ED eating patterns rather than indicating a direct causative role in the disorder’s development. According to our results, psychiatric consultation for ED detection remains the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment. brain-derived neurotrophic factor dietary intake disordered eating risk perceived stress levels metabolic equivalent young nutritionist Jordanian female adults pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes cover-date January-December 2025 typesetter ts1 Introduction Eating disorders (EDs) are a group of serious psychiatric illnesses characterized by abnormal eating patterns that result in social behaviors that have a significant impact on individuals’ quality of life and ability to interact socially.  1  2  3  4  5 From an etiological perspective, many factors contribute to the development of EDs. 6 7 8 11 8 11 8 11 Recent research has focused on the potential role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in disease progression.  12  13  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20 The elevated prevalence of EDs/DE among females may be associated with a range of biological, psychological, and societal variables.  11  21 13 21  22  13  23  24  25  26 University students enrolled in health-related majors—particularly those in nutrition and dietetics—appear particularly vulnerable to DE behaviors. This vulnerability may be due to increased exposure to food- and body-related knowledge, heightened body image awareness, and internalization of dietary control ideologies promoted in their curriculum. A recent study found that between 4% and 32% of nutrition and dietetics students are at high risk for developing EDs.  27 Materials and methods Study design A cross-sectional multistage study was conducted in Jordan to assess the prevalence of DE and to examine salivary BDNF levels as a potential biomarker for ED risk. The reporting of this study conforms to the STROBE statement for observational studies  28 Supplemental Material 1 This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Jordan (Decision ID: UOJ-REC-03-56). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before their enrollment in the study. Stage 1: The prevalence of ‘high-risk’ versus ‘low-risk’ EDs A total of 216 participants were recruited. The inclusion criteria for participants were as follows: (1) female, (2) healthy (free from known medical conditions), (3) aged 18–25 years, and (4) studying nutrition and dietetics at the University of Jordan/Nutrition and Food Technology Department between January and December 2023. The exclusion criteria were: (1) male participants, (2) during menstrual period, (3) pregnant and lactating, (4) use of any medication in the past 7 days, and (6) a known history of psychiatric disorders. In the first stage, we collected demographic information, including age, height, and weight, to compute the body mass index (BMI) for all 216 participants. They completed the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) questionnaire to assess the risk of developing EDs using an online questionnaire distributed through various recruitment strategies, such as social media advertisements, word-of-mouth, and professional contacts. All the data were coded and stored in a secure Google Drive accessible only to the researchers. In this study, the standardized and validated Arabic translation of the EAT-26 was used.  29  30  31  32 Stage 2: Measuring BDNF and other factors for those at ‘high risk’ versus at ‘low risk’ of developing EDs A nested sample of 34 females was selected based on their EAT-26 scores. Participants with scores in the upper quartile (above the 75th percentile; high-risk group, n n Participants in this stage were asked to provide a salivary BDNF mouth swab and complete other questionnaires, such as the Arabic version of Cohen’s PSS-10 scale (PSS-10) to assess participants’ stress,  33  34  35 For the BDNF test, 34 females were asked to perform passive saliva collection to determine BDNF levels. Saliva samples were collected by mouth swabbing with a cotton stick and then stored in tubes from all participants in the morning following an overnight fast. Particular attention was given to ensuring the absence of the menstrual cycle in the same month during which the EAT-26 questionnaire was completed. The salivary samples were stored at −20°C for 30–40 days with no protease inhibitor added per the manufacturer’s kit instructions, which ensured the stability of BDNF without the inhibitors. We used a BDNF ELISA kit (CV%: 12%) to measure BDNF levels in the saliva (GenoChem World, Valencia). 36 37 The perceived stress score PSS-10 is a 10-item questionnaire designed to evaluate self-reported stress.  33  38 The IPAQ-SF, a validated tool for estimating physical activity among adults, was used to quantify the participants’ physical activity levels.  34 The FFQ was used to assess the regularity of food consumption in the five major food categories. In six categories (rarely or never, once to three times/month, three to six times/week, once to two times/week, twice/day, once/day), participants were asked how frequently they had generally consumed the 30 primary food items. 38 35  35 All questionnaires are available in Supplemental Material 2 Statistical methods Descriptive statistics are presented as the median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables, and counts and percentages were used to summarize categorical data in the study. Reporting descriptive statistics in this manner (i.e., median and IQR) allows for appropriate characterization of the data given its nonnormal distribution, enabling suitable interpretation of the results for the reader. The Mann‒Whitney test was used to compare the differences between the high-risk ED group and the low-risk ED group. This statistical analysis method is appropriate for nonparametric data and can be used to compare two independent groups. By utilizing this statistical test, we were able to determine whether there were significant differences in BDNF levels between the two groups of participants. Spearman’s rank correlation was used to explore relationships between different study variables. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient is an important statistical measure used in this study to explore relationships between different variables being analyzed. It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables, allowing researchers to quantify the degree of association between variables such as BDNF levels, age, and BMI. Calculating correlations helps identify which variable pairs are more strongly related and may warrant further investigation into potential causal relationships. Understanding these interrelationships provides a crucial context for interpreting the overall study findings and results, as correlations can guide more advanced modeling techniques, such as logistic regression, used to predict ED risk based on BDNF while controlling for other factors. The risk of ED based on BDNF was predicted using logistic regression analysis after adjustments for age and BMI. The odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) are reported. The R Statistical Computing program (version R 4.3.2) was used to perform the statistical analyses for this study, with significance set at p Results Results of Stage 1: The prevalence of ‘high-risk’ versus ‘low-risk’ EDs A total of 250 female university students participated in this stage, and 216 provided usable responses (response rate 90%). The median age was 23 years (IQR = 4.00 years), and the BMI was 22.51 kg/m 2 2 Results of Stage 2: Measuring BDNF and other factors for those at ‘high risk’ versus at ‘low risk’ of developing EDs The second stage included 34 participants with the lowest scores (i.e., from the 25th percentile for EAT-26 scores with an EAT-26 score of approximately 10) who were labeled ‘low-risk’ ( n n The demographic characteristics of the 34 participants included in stage 2 are presented in Table 1 2  39 Table 1.

We hypothesized that salivary BDNF might be associated with EDs  40  13 In contrast, salivary BDNF levels among our study group did not show such alterations concerning EDs. The BDNF level was within the normal concentration range. This outcome is consistent with the findings of Mandel et al.  41  42  43  22 Our findings appear to contradict the anticipated outcome, as there was no statistically significant difference between BDNF levels in EDs in the higher-risk and lower-risk groups. However, a simple correlation between BDNF and factors such as starvation or increased body weight did not exist.  22  44 22 45 In the current study, BMI significantly differed between the higher- and lower-risk groups, with higher BMIs observed in the high-risk group. This finding is consistent with several studies showing that obesity and EDs have common maintenance and risk factors, including self-dissatisfaction, dieting, concerns about shape/weight, and unhealthy weight control behaviors, which are very common among young adults. 13 22 46  47  48  49  50  51  52 Despite the lack of association between BDNF and physical activity levels, our results showed increased physical activity within the high-risk group, which may have led to an increase in the levels of BDNF. Both BDNF and exercise are associated with improvements in neurogenesis.  45  53 Surprisingly, our study did not show a significant difference in the consumption of different food groups between the high- and low-risk groups. The high consumption of artificially sweetened beverages among women with ED is intriguing.  54  55 Associations between BDNF and BMI, stress, or the intake of different food groups were not detected in our study. In contrast, previous studies revealed positive correlations between BDNF serum levels and BMI, suggesting that BDNF concentration changes in the circulation are secondary to the dysregulation of energy balance. 44 56  57  19  58  57  59 In addition, it has been suggested that stress and biological system responses play a role in BDNF changes.  58  60 61 62 Finally, several factors may explain the lack of significant differences in salivary BDNF levels between the low-risk and high-risk ED groups. The fact that BDNF levels in saliva reflect peripheral rather than central nervous system concentrations, potentially limiting their sensitivity as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric conditions, Moreover, BDNF is influenced by various endogenous factors such as hormonal fluctuations, especially estrogen. Limitation The study’s limitations were that the small sample size limited the statistical power to detect differences in BDNF levels between groups due to the limited availability of BDNF kits and the fact that female participants was used, rather than both sexes. Therefore, our results do not necessarily represent males. Furthermore, the onset of ED may influence the levels of BDNF. Since BDNF increases with time, increased BDNF could be affected by a long diagnosis period.  62 Conclusion Salivary BDNF may not appear as a biomarker for ED among young females. The changes in salivary BDNF levels could reflect individual ED eating patterns rather than indicating a direct causative role in the disorder’s development. These results advocate the use of psychiatric consultation for the detection of EDs, emphasizing the need for sophisticated detection beyond biomarkers such as BDNF. As salivary BDNF showed no utility as an ED biomarker in this preliminary study, future work should explore longitudinal designs, larger samples including male and female, and CSF–serum–saliva BDNF correlations to explore the intricate correlation between BDNF and EDs.
