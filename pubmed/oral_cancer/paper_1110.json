The introduction of multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy has led to improvements in response rates and survival rates. Additionally, the application of these therapies is expanding beyond advanced-stage cancer to include their combination with local therapies at the intermediate stage. Further efforts are needed to optimize treatment selection and develop new drugs to improve the prognosis of patients. Abstract The focus of treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has shifted significantly from local therapy to systemic drug therapy. Recently, the efficacy of drug therapy for HCC has made rapid progress. We have transitioned from eras of sorafenib monotherapy and sequential therapy with multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors that slightly improved patient prognoses, to an era where the introduction of immunotherapy combining atezolizumab and bevacizumab has achieved further improvements in patient prognosis. The availability of highly effective drugs has expanded the range of diseases treatable by drug therapy. Additionally, instead of initiating drug therapy at advanced stages, combining it with local therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization at an earlier stage with the aim of achieving a cure has become possible, improving treatment outcomes further. Currently, the number of regimens available for HCC, including combinations of multiple drugs and local therapies, has increased, leading to numerous clinical trials. Additionally, HCC cases that were previously unresectable are now resectable after drug therapy, necessitating the establishment of a resectability classification system. This review summarizes the current evidence for drug therapy for HCC and discusses future treatment strategies, treatment combinations, and prospects. hepatocellular carcinoma systemic chemotherapy combination immunotherapy molecular targeted agent combination of locoregional therapy and systemic chemotherapy This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Until around the year 2000, the treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) focused on the surveillance of high-risk cases with hepatitis C or hepatitis B for its early detection, with local therapy being the primary treatment modality. Advances in systemic therapy progressed little after the introduction of the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (mTKI) sorafenib in 2008 as a first-line treatment for HCC [ 1 2 Another mTKI, lenvatinib, demonstrated non-inferior overall survival (OS) compared with sorafenib and had favourable progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORR) as a first-line therapy [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Drug therapy was initially indicated for advanced cancer where local therapies such as resection or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) were not feasible, and was primarily targeted at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C. However, the concepts of TACE-refractory [ 10 11 12 13 2. Advances and Prospects in Systemic Therapy for Advanced-Stage HCC 2.1. Advances and Prospects in First-Line Therapies In 2008, the SHARP trial demonstrated that sorafenib significantly outperformed placebo in terms of OS and PFS for the treatment of advanced HCC, making it the first oral mTKI approved as a systemic drug therapy for HCC [ 1 14 15 16 3 17 18 ICIs have demonstrated promising therapeutic effects in various types of cancer; however, nivolumab monotherapy for HCC failed to demonstrate superiority over sorafenib [ 19 20 7 Cancer cells can be classified as “immune hot” (high infiltration of CD8+ and CD3+ T cells in colon cancer tissues), “immune cold” (low immune cell infiltration), both of which were closely associated with survival rates [ 21 22 23 24 Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy is thought to exert its antitumour effect through the combined effects of an ICI plus an anti-VEGF inhibitor, by suppressing immunosuppressive Tregs, restoring the immune activity of CD8+ cells [ 25 26 27 28 7 29 n Durvalumab (anti-PDL-1 antibody) plus tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4] antibody), the first combination regimen of two ICIs, significantly improved OS compared with sorafenib in the HIMALAYA trial (16.4 months vs. 13.8 months [HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.92]) [ 8 8 In May 2025, the results of the CheckMate9DW study of nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) plus ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) therapy were published [ 9 p In 2025, the results of the HEPATORCH trial were published [ 30 p p In the CheckMate 459 single-agent trial, nivolumab was not superior to sorafenib with an OS of 16.4 months vs. 14.7 months [ 19 31 Pembrolizumab was effective in the Phase II KEYNOTE-244 single-agent trial, with an ORR of 16% and a median OS of 17 months [ 32 p 33 2.2. Recent Developments in First-Line Therapy for HCC Numerous trials aimed at developing first-line drugs for future use are currently underway. Among the trials with published results, in addition to the previously mentioned LEAP-002 trial, the COSMIC 312 trial compared cabozantinib plus atezolizumab with sorafenib. An interim analysis failed to demonstrate an improvement in the OS (15.4 months for cabozantinib plus atezolizumab vs. 15.5 months for sorafenib), but the PFS was significantly improved (6.8 months vs. 4.2 months; HR 0.63, p 34 The anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab demonstrated non-inferior OS prolongation compared with sorafenib in the RATIONALE-301 trial, with a median OS of 15.9 months vs. 14.1 months (HR 0.85), and an objective response rate of 14.3% vs. 5.4% [ 35 There are also several ongoing Phase II/III clinical trials ( Table 1 NCT05904886 36 37 NCT05665348 Regarding the development of drugs with mechanisms of action other than immune checkpoint inhibition, a Phase II/III trial is currently underway comparing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and tremelimumab plus durvalumab with the TGF-β inhibitor livmoniplimab and the PD-1 antibody budigalimab ( NCT06109272 38 NCT05883644 39 40 NCT04720716 41 42 NCT05408221 43 The NCT04401800 44 NCT04310709 45 NCT05924997 46 2.3. Advances and Prospects in Second-Line and Beyond Therapies To date, following the failure of sorafenib, the only agents with randomized prospective trial evidence as second-line or later therapies are regorafenib (RESORCE trial) [ 4 6 5 4 5 47 6 Pembrolizumab demonstrated a statistically non-significant improvement in OS of 13.9 months vs. 10.6 months (HR 0.781, 95% CI: 0.611–0.998, p 48 There are currently no treatment regimens with evidence supporting their use as second-line therapy following ICIs. However, in the IMbrave150 trial, the rate of progression to second-line therapy was 35% [ 49 Currently, the IMbrave251 trial ( NCT04770896 50 NCT05201404 51 NCT04696055 52 A Phase II study of TQB2450, an anti-PD-1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, in combination with anlotinib, is also ongoing in patients with HCC who have failed ICI therapy (FAITH trial; NCT06031480 53 54 55 56 Table 2 2.4. Treatment Algorithms for Advanced HCC in the Guidelines of Various Countries (As of May 2025) Although guidelines have been published by various countries worldwide, this review will discuss the drug therapy algorithms for advanced HCC as outlined in the representative guidelines of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), and the Japanese Society of Hepatology (JSH). The most recently revised guidelines are those of the ESMO, which were published in 2025 [ 57 The EASL guidelines discuss various drug therapies in the section on systemic therapies. For patients with advanced HCC, preserved liver function (Child–Pugh A), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–1, they recommend combinations including at least one PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, provided there are no contraindications (Level of Evidence 1, strong recommendation, strong consensus). Regarding the choice of drugs, combination therapy containing PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors should be considered for the first-line standard of care for those without contraindications to ICIs (and bevacizumab). There is no evidence to support the use of one option in preference to another. As a treatment-switching strategy, mTKIs are considered a second-line option if progression is confirmed after ICI plus VEGF combination therapy. In cases of Child–Pugh B or higher, or risk of liver failure, ICIs are noted to be used with caution. There are no clear differences in treatment selection based on the etiology of HCC, and no overall effect on treatment efficacy has been observed. Furthermore, the guidelines emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary team-based patient-centred decision-making and urge optimal choices at each stage of treatment and diagnosis [ 58 According to the AASLD recommendations [ 59 According to the JSH guidelines [ 60 61 As such, treatment sequences and drug therapy usage differentiation for HCC vary slightly between the guidelines of different countries, and there is currently no clear evidence for any particular sequence. Drugs for treating advanced HCC are broadly classified into molecular-targeted drugs centred around VEGF inhibitors and ICIs, and the development of treatments has mainly focused on combinations of two or three of these drug types. Currently, the combination of two or three ICIs with different mechanisms of action (anti-PD-1 antibodies/anti-PD-L1 antibodies/anti-CTLA-4 antibodies) or the combination of a molecular-targeted drug with any ICI is the mainstream treatment for advanced HCC. For “immune hot” tumours, monotherapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies/anti-PD-L1 antibodies is expected to be effective. For “immune altered (excluded)” tumours, a combination of anti-VEGF antibodies and anti-PD-1 antibodies/anti-PD-L1 antibodies is likely to be effective. For “immune cold” tumours, a combination of anti-PD-1 antibodies/anti-PD-L1 antibodies and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is likely to be effective. Additionally, a combination of ICIs was reported to be beneficial in some HCC cases, with effects lasting over a long period [ 62 However, various immune-related adverse events have been reported in patients treated with drug combinations. Even when using the same ICIs, immune-related adverse events may differ depending on the type of ICI [ 9 30 63 3. Advances and Prospects for the Use and Combination of Drug Therapy and Locoregional Therapy for Intermediate- and Advanced-Stage HCC 3.1. Differentiation Between Drug Therapy and Local Therapy Unlike other cancers, liver cell cancer has several local treatment options, such as ablation therapy and TACE. Therefore, local therapy has traditionally been considered the primary treatment for middle-stage cancer. In particular, TACE has historically been considered appropriate if the cancer is confined to the liver. TACE provides long OS when a complete response (CR) is achieved with initial treatment, but the prognosis is poor when a CR is not achieved [ 64 65 (i) Unlikely to respond to TACE: confluent multinodular type, massive or infiltrative type, simple nodular type with extranodular growth, poorly differentiated type, intrahepatic multiple disseminated nodules, or sarcomatous changes after TACE. (ii) Likely to develop TACE failure/refractoriness: Up-to-7 criteria out nodules. (iii) Likely to become Child–Pugh B or C after TACE: Up-to-7 criteria out nodules (especially bilobar multifocal HCC) modified albumin–bilirubin grade 2b. The Up-to-7 criteria is a classification standard based on whether the sum of the tumour size and number exceeds 7, reflecting the tumour volume. A retrospective analysis by Kudo et al. compared groups that received lenvatinib therapy and those that underwent TACE in a propensity-matched control analysis of a group where TACE was expected to be ineffective and reported that lenvatinib was more effective in terms of OS and PFS [ 66 67 Regarding the future prospects of TACE and systemic drug therapy, the ABC-HCC trial ( NCT04803994 68 NCT04777851 69 3.2. Combination of Drug Therapy and Local Therapy In 2019, Kudo et al. reported that sorafenib plus TACE significantly improved PFS compared with TACE alone [ 70 71 12 13 In 2023, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab followed by curative conversion (ABC conversion) therapy combining atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy with TACE, radiofrequency ablation, and resection was reported. This treatment achieved a CR rate of 30% and a complete remission (cancer-free, drug-free) rate of 19% [ 72 NCT03778957 73 A large-scale randomized controlled clinical trial is currently underway to evaluate the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab therapy with TACE for unresectable HCC (IMPACT trial jRCTs051230037) [ 74 75 76 77 78 79 Table 3 4. Systemic Therapy and Radical Treatment Conventionally, drug therapy has been indicated only for HCC when resection is not feasible. However, reports have increasingly suggested that conversion resection may be possible after drug therapy [ 80 81 82 83 5. Advances and Prospects of Drug Therapy as Adjuvant Chemotherapy After Surgery Regarding postoperative chemotherapy for HCC, an interim analysis of the IMbrave050 trial reported that the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab significantly improved PFS in patients with high-risk HCC following surgery [ 84 85 NCT03383458 86 NCT03847428 87 NCT03867084 88 89 90 6. Differences in the Efficacy of Drug Therapy Based on HCC Histological Subtypes and Gene Expression HCC is histologically and pathologically highly diverse, and several subtypes have been suggested to influence the prognosis and treatment response. However, there are currently no high-level randomized trials demonstrating differences in treatment efficacy associated with HCC subtype. A pathological subtype termed macrotrabecular-massive (MTM) HCC is defined by the presence of predominant (>50%) macrotrabecular architecture (more than six cells thick) and is associated with cancer malignancy [ 91 92 93 94 CTNNB1 95 96 7. Future Directions of HCC Chemotherapy Currently, various drug development efforts are underway for HCC at different stages, including multiple combination immunotherapies and novel molecular-targeted agents for advanced HCC, combinations of TACE with molecular-targeted agents for HCC classified as BCLC B, combinations of TACE with combination immunotherapy, combinations with radiation therapy, and chemotherapy aimed at preventing tumour recurrence. At present, the prognosis for liver cancer is still poor, but future drug therapy for HCC is expected to shift from a treatment approach focused on extending survival by sequentially administering single agents to a treatment approach aimed at achieving a cure by combining various drugs and local therapies. Although further long-term survival is expected, challenges remain regarding how to optimize the use of various drugs, including their selection and sequence of administration, and the development of appropriate biomarkers that include genetic mutations and histological characteristics for optimal drug use. Regarding the treatment of HCC, treatment sequences based on evidence such as gene mutations, which have been proposed for other cancers, have not yet been developed. In the future, it is likely that treatment development, including individualized treatment, will be necessary. 8. Conclusions Systemic therapy for HCC has evolved rapidly over the past decade. Currently, many Phase III trials are underway. In clinical practice, it is essential to correctly understand these rapid changes in treatment and respond quickly and accurately. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed. Finally, it will be important to understand the advantages and limitations of current drug therapies in clinical practice and new drug development to address these challenges.
