This waste contains valuable phytochemicals like carotenoids, essential oils, (poly)phenols, pectin, and vitamins, which can be used as nutraceuticals or key ingredients in functional foods for managing diabetes and obesity. Repurposing citrus peel waste offers an excellent opportunity to advance biorefineries and the bioeconomy. Compounds derived from citrus have attracted attention for their potential therapeutic effects on diabetes and obesity, and their effectiveness depends on various mechanisms.

Introduction Obesity is a multifaceted disorder characterised by excessive dysregulation of body weight due to modification of adipose tissue 1 2 3 4 5 As obesity is primarily caused by excess energy, drugs that reduce energy imbalance are of research interest. The currently used anti-obesity drugs act through various mechanisms of action, including reducing food intake (appetite suppressants/satiety inducers), increasing energy expenditure (mitochondrial uncouplers), promoting fat mobilisation (leptin analogues/agonists, GLP-1 agonists) and decreasing digestion/absorption of food (pancreatic lipase inhibitors) 6 , 7 This review discusses pancreatic lipase inhibitors, which slow down the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) into fatty acids (FA) in the small intestine (as depicted in Figure 1 8 Figure 1. Diagram illustrating citrus peels that contain potential nutraceuticals, which can serve as drug targets for digestive enzymes. These nutraceuticals may be utilised to influence the breakdown of starch by amylolytic enzymes, specifically α-amylase and α-glucosidase, resulting in the production of glucose. Additionally, they can aid in the breakdown of triacylglycerols (TAGs) by pancreatic lipase into fatty acids (FAs). The figure was created in www.biorender.com T2D is a metabolic disease in which tissues resist insulin exposure 9 10 11–13 14–16 17 One approach to treating T2D is to limit glucose production and absorption into the bloodstream. In the human body, glucose originates from the breakdown of dietary carbohydrates 15 18 14 19–21 Figure 1 22 Citrus fruits are among the most widely produced, processed and consumed in the world 23 Citrus bergamia Citrus paradisi Citrus sinensis Citrus limon Citrus aurantiifolia Citrus reticulata Citrus maxima Figure 2 23 24 25 Figure 2. Citrus fruit cultivars of bergamot ( Citrus bergamia 1 Citrus paradisi 2 Citrus sinensis 3 Citrus limon 4 Citrus aurantiifolia 5 Citrus reticulata 6 Citrus maxima 7 The demand for natural and plant-based therapies is increasing, and CPs are an accessible and cost-effective source of potential bioactive compounds 26 in vitro 2. Methodology The literature source approach applied to this systematic review used electronic databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Elsevier, and Web of Science to search for reviews and in vitro in silico n in vivo 3. Different classes of major compounds found in citrus peels Phytochemicals present in CPs, such as essential oils, carotenoids and phenolics, are useful in various industries, including food and cosmetics and are beneficial in combating lifestyle diseases 27 in vitro 3.1. Carotenoids Carotenoids are a class of compounds with an isoprenoid basic structure ( Figure 3a 25 28 29 30 Citrus sinensis 31 Figure 3. Basic structures of different classes of compounds in citrus peel. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) 3.2. Essential oils Essential oils are a mixture of volatile compounds typically derived from terpenes, a class of chemicals made up of isoprenes, which are five-carbon units 32 Figure 3b Figure 3c 33 34 , 35 36 35 , 37 3.3. (Poly)phenols 3.3.1. Flavonoids Flavonoids consist of a 15-carbon skeleton with two six-carbon phenyl rings linked by a heterocyclic ring with an embedded oxygen, as shown in Figure 3d 25 38 25 , 39 Citrus-derived flavonoids exist in glycoside or aglycone forms, with the aglycone not occurring naturally but linked to the glycosides through a sugar moiety 40 O C 41 42 43 3.3.2. Phenolic acids Phenolics contain a single phenol group that may be substituted with various functional groups, such as one or more hydroxyl groups or a carboxylic acid group (phenolic acids) 44 45 Figure 3f Figure 3g 46 47 These citrus peel-derived compounds, including pectin, (poly)phenols, carotenoids and essential oils, have been well studied for their pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-bacterial and cytotoxic activities 25 , 42 in vitro in vitro 3.4. Pectin Pectin polymers consist of alternating α-1,4-linked galacturonic acids and α-1,2-linked rhamnose residues in the backbone ( Figure 3e d l 48 , 49 50 25 34 24 51 4. The mechanism of action of amylolytic enzymes and pancreatic lipase against their respective substrates It is essential to understand how the substrates interact with amylolytic and lipolytic enzymes prior to examining the inhibitory effects of potential phytochemicals against these enzymes. α-Amylase breaks down starch, specifically targeting α-(1,4) glycosidic linkages, releasing maltotriose and maltose from amylose, as well as glucose, maltose, and limit dextrins from amylopectin 52 , 53 Sus scrofa 54 , 55 56 α-Glucosidase hydrolyses α-1,4-glucosidic linkages in disaccharides and oligosaccharides, releasing glucose into the intestinal lumen, where it is then absorbed into the bloodstream 57 Saccharomyces cerevisiae 58 58 Pancreatic lipase hydrolyses dietary triglycerides (TGs) into monoglycerides and free fatty acids through a serine hydrolase-type catalytic process 59 Sus scrofa 60 61 60 5. Virtual screening of citrus peel phytochemicals against T2D and obesity enzyme targets: amylolytic enzymes and pancreatic lipase In the field of drug discovery, computational techniques are commonly used to screen for potential compounds that target specific proteins as disease targets. These techniques involve the use of computer-aided methods to filter small groups of predicted compounds from compound libraries, which are then tested experimentally for biological activity 62 63 Computational techniques include quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) and quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods to help correlate the molecular descriptors and their biological activities. QSPR refers to the prediction of the chemical properties of desired compounds, whereas QSAR models biological activities 62 , 64 Virtual screening identifies molecules with high binding affinities for specific protein targets and associates molecular descriptors with biological activities 65 , 66 in vitro 67 in vitro 65 The docking score is influenced by the binding interactions between the ligand and the binding site of the target proteins, which include non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces, as illustrated in Figure 4 68 69 70 54 , 55 Figure 4. Binding interaction network of the best-docked compounds in the active sites of α-amylase (PDB ID: 1DHK) and α-glucosidase (PDB ID: 3AJ7), as reported in Table 1 Binding interaction network of the best-docked compounds in the active site of pancreatic lipase (PDB ID: 1ETH) as reported in Table 1 Numerous phytochemicals found in CPs, such as chlorogenic acid, hesperidin, naringenin, and quercetin, exhibited higher binding affinities than acarbose and orlistat against the respective protein targets of these FDA-approved drugs when assessed with AutoDock Vina v1.1.2 ( Table 1 71 71 Table 1.

Structure–activity relationship (SAR) of citrus peel compounds towards amylolytic enzymes and pancreatic lipase The structural features of compounds play a significant role in their bioactivity. The chemical class of compounds and the different configurations in the molecular structure within the chemical class influence the binding affinity and, in turn, their bioactivity towards protein targets. For example, (poly)phenols have been shown to exhibit stronger binding affinities than other classes of compounds, such as essential oils, towards amylolytic enzymes and pancreatic lipase ( Table 1 in silico 91 6.1. Carotenoids Several studies have identified carotenoid extracts from natural sources as potent inhibitors of metabolic enzymes, including α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase 92 93 93 Carotenoid compounds are characterised by some structural features that influence their biological properties and activities; structural features such as their long chains conjugated double bond (polyene), presence of different functional groups, oxygenated derivatives (xanthophylls) and terminal ring structures 94 95 , 96 Carotenoids are widely recognised for their antioxidant properties and their potential anti-diabetic and anti-obesity activities 93 , 97 , 98 6.2. Essential oils Previous studies have reported the binding affinity of various essential oils, such as terpenes, limonene, terpinene, and pinene, to α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase, with varying affinities ( Table 1 75 75 99 in vitro 100 in silico Table 1 75 88 88 Most studies have investigated the amylolytic enzymes and pancreatic lipase inhibition activities of essential oils as extracts 101 , 102 6.3.

Pectin The effects of pectin on the regulation and digestion of starch and lipids have been studied extensively. Obtaining the structural details of pectin samples is crucial for analysing structural relationships. These include molecular weight, sugar linkages, side-chain composition, and the extent of acetylation, methylation, and esterification. Comparing the functions of structurally distinct pectins is necessary to understand their SAR 111 Pectin extracted from lemons has a high concentration of eriocitrin and has been reported to be a more potent inhibitor of α-glucosidase than other citrus species 112 34 113 113 , 114 A study by Espinal-Ruiz et al. 114 114 In a study conducted by Liang et al. 115 44 115 116 111 7. In vitro 7.1. Amylolytic enzyme inhibitory properties of citrus peel-derived phytochemicals Several studies have demonstrated the inhibition of amylolytic enzymes by CP-derived essential oils as a promising alternative approach to T2D management. For example, Dang et al. 117 102 d 118 C. sinensis C. limon 101 101 A comparative study by Rangarajan et al. 119 119 120 Citrus aurantium 120 121 Citrus aurantium 121 Flavonoids have also shown promise in controlling T2D and metabolic syndrome by inhibiting α-glucosidase and lowering blood lipid levels 122 89 50 Table 2 123 Table 2 105 C. sinensis 50 > Table 2.

Nonetheless, further research is needed to explore the potential synergistic effects of combining (poly)phenols with acarbose for T2D and obesity treatment. Acarbose has many side effects that might be mitigated by these natural compounds. There are also no studies showing combination therapies, with the possibility of synergistic effects between (poly)phenols and acarbose, which requires further exploration. These phenolic compounds are produced in varying amounts in different citrus species and can be extracted to various degrees depending on the method employed 40 7.2. Pancreatic lipase inhibitory properties of citrus peel phytochemicals Pancreatic lipase is the enzyme responsible for digesting 50–70% of triglycerides into monoacylglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA), which are then absorbed into the body. Inhibiting pancreatic lipase is a major target in combating obesity, as it reduces fat absorption and overall energy intake 124 Ocimum basilicum 125 126 127 Citrus junos sieb. Citrus limon 127 Six bioactive flavonoids (3,5,6,7,8,3′,4′-heptamethoxyflavone, didymin, hesperidin, narirutin, nobiletin and tangeretin) from C. reticulata 128 50 128 80 Capsicum frutescens 50 K i 90 C. sinensis 50 Pectin extracted from fresh grapefruit peels ( C. paradisi 50 50 113 Table 2 129 114 24 , 130 , 131 A study was conducted to evaluate the impact of pectin on lipase, α-amylase, alkaline phosphatase and protease enzymatic activities. The results indicated that pectin polysaccharides (PPs) were non-competitive inhibitors of these enzymes. The inhibitory effect became more pronounced with higher concentrations and molecular weights of PPs, with lipase being the most susceptible to inhibition 114 Phenolics are well reported for their pancreatic lipase inhibition action; for example, several studies showed that most phenolic compounds inhibit pancreatic lipase, but not more than orlistat. Caffeic acid, ρ-coumaric acid and gallic acid showed similar inhibition at concentrations 400 times higher than orlistat 80 , 82 109 in vitro 50 It is important to consider other factors such as antioxidant properties, gastrointestinal stability, cytotoxicity, and their effects on the microbiome. As mentioned above, combination studies should be considered to study any possible synergistic effects between (poly)phenols and orlistat to mitigate side effects and produce a more efficient treatment. The metabolic pathways by which these phytochemicals are produced should be further explored. Furthermore, Citrus depressa extracts To date, numerous studies have focused on CP extracts for their inhibitory properties against amylolytic and pancreatic lipase enzymes; however, there are limited studies assessing the inhibition of these enzymes by isolated and pure phytochemicals. This calls for more studies to be carried out using these isolated and pure phytochemicals to better elucidate SAR for each chemical class of CP-derived phytochemicals. This review has, nonetheless, highlighted that several in silico 132 It is worth noting that most in vitro 50 K i 50 K i in vitro 133 in vitro 7.3. Digestive enzyme inhibitory properties of citrus peel phytochemicals Digestive enzymes, such as pepsin, trypsin and protease in the gastrointestinal tract, can be inhibited by citrus peel phytochemicals, leading to unwanted cross-reactions that can cause nutritional deficiencies 137 138 139–141 Beneficial cross reactions of citrus peel phytochemicals can include the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a well-known target for diabetes and obesity treatment 142 143 8. Study limitations: in silico in vitro There is a lack of standardisation of extraction methods, as different extraction techniques can yield varying concentrations and profiles of phytochemicals, leading to inconsistencies in bioactivity results across different studies conducted with these differently acquired CP extracts from the same citrus cultivar. Hence, ensuring the purity and concentration of extracted compounds can be challenging, impacting reproducibility in studies. Many studies report inhibitory concentrations against these enzyme targets without including the compounds’ mode of inhibition (kinetic studies). Understanding the mode of inhibition is essential for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the compounds’ effectiveness. Reported research studies use human, rat or porcine-derived digestive enzymes to screen for the potential bioactivity of the CP extracts. However, this can lead to variations in the reported efficacy of the said phytochemical due to subtle differences in structural and biochemical properties of the various protein homologues used in these studies. This calls for standardised in vitro Lastly, in vitro in silico in vitro in silico in vivo In silico in vitro 144 9. Conclusion and future perspectives This review has highlighted a gap in the potential utility of CP-derived phytochemicals, which have not yet been reviewed for their role as amylolytic enzymes and pancreatic lipase inhibitors, potentially serving as lead anti-diabetic and anti-obesity agents ( Figure 5 in vitro K i Figure 5. Summary of the range IC 50 www.biorender.com For instance, changes in the number and position of functional groups on a phenolic compound could dramatically alter its ability to bind to the enzyme’s active site. These potential bioactive compounds could mitigate the side effects of currently used drugs such as acarbose, therefore, warranting their further investigation through in vivo Acknowledgments All authors contributed equally to this systematic review.
