Introduction Shoulder pain, experienced as acute or chronic, can be caused by supraspinatus tendinitis. Triggers may include carrying heavy loads in front of and away from the body, injuries from throwing with the hands, or aggressive usage of exercise equipment. Younger people, due to overuse or improper use of the shoulder joint, develop acute supraspinatus tendinitis, which frequently does not receive proper treatment and rest. Older people are more likely to develop chronic supraspinatus tendinitis, and it typically manifests more gradually or subtly, without any identifiable prior trauma [ 1 2 The severe and persistent discomfort caused by supraspinatus tendinitis causes intense, ongoing pain that frequently interferes with sleep and affects around 19–25% of the general population during their lifetimes. The primary site of discomfort is the deltoid muscles. It is moderate to severe and could cause the affected shoulder to gradually lose its range of motion. The patient often wakes up during the night while turning over onto the afflicted shoulder [ 3 4 5 6 7 The supraspinatus has been well studied in recent years, since the rotator cuff muscle is most commonly damaged. Despite its small dimensions, this muscle has been well-described, but there is still much left to learn and discover, especially because chronic supraspinatus tendinopathy is a common pain syndrome that causes functional and labor disabilities in the population. The most common alterations caused by tendinopathy include neovascularization, disordered fibrils, and increased tendon thickness. All of the above usually appear after repetitive microtrauma, which is typically brought on by loading activities [ 8 9 The actual management protocol for supraspinatus tendinitis includes physical rest, drugs such as anti-inflammatories, local injections with corticosteroid, and conservative rehabilitation procedures such as physiotherapy. Many studies in the literature have examined the impact of physiotherapy procedures (TENS, ultrasound, laser), and more modern ones, such as shockwave therapy, in particular, on musculoskeletal disorders. We want to provide a comprehensive overview and summarize the advantages of using shockwave therapy (ESWT) for the supraspinatus muscles due to the lack of specificity in the literature regarding the limits and the ability of practitioners to use ESWT [ 7 8 9 10 After reviewing treatment protocols in the literature, we intend to highlight the need for a more comprehensive understanding and establish that the optimal number of sessions, intensity, pulses, and treatment intervals differ when treating shoulder tendinopathy. This narrative review aims to synthesize the existing information and set current directions for the conservative treatment of tendinopathy, focused on the supraspinatus muscle. Different types of passive physical therapy are often prescribed in conjunction with medical treatment. However, there are no guidelines for physical therapy in MSK conditions, including shoulder tendinopathies, with practical recommendations graded according to the scientific evidence. In recent years, many studies have shown promising results in improving function, restoring range of motion, reducing pain, and improving ADL in patients with supraspinatus tendinopathy. This narrative review aimed to Briefly overview the current literature on the pathogenesis of supraspinatus tendinopathies; Provide the most recent and convincing evidence on the ESWT effects on supraspinatus tendinopathy; Compare the importance of using ESWT in different stages of supraspinatus tendinopathy, an essential aspect for future practice and recommendation in the rehabilitation area. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Extraction From January 2024 to July 2024, research was conducted across several significant databases, including PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, Academic Search Premier, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink, to develop a narrative review of the actual literature regarding the use of ESWT on shoulder supraspinatus tendinopathy. We used the operators “AND”, “OR”, and “shoulder” OR “rotator cuffs” OR “conservative treatment” OR “Shockwave”, OR “Physical Therapy”; the following essential phrases were added and combined: (“exercise” OR “acute exercise” OR “chronic exercise” OR “training” OR “physical activity” OR “endurance training” OR “resistance training”) for the selection of studies. In addition, relevant studies were found in the full-text publications’ reference lists and by searching related articles and citations in the PubMed database. The authors submitted the article in the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols with the number INPLASY202480067. A narrative review with systematic elements (rather than a meta-analysis) was conducted because of the significant heterogeneity of the included studies concerning the type of physical therapy method, participant characteristics, and physical activity level. 2.2. Study Selection—Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria We performed research through the medical literature, including clinical studies that met the criteria of being published after 2014 and having a minimum seven-point score on the PEDro scale (see Table 1 2.3. Characteristics of the Included Articles Two authors (M.-D.A. and R.N.) separately evaluated the titles selected from the abovementioned literature search based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria (over 300 articles). At each step of exclusion, we used the title and abstract of each of the 300 articles first selected, and after that, we performed a full-text screening of the articles remaining, as noted in Table 2 Initially, we identified a total of 1517 records, and later, we added 7 more records. Then, we began removing duplicates and performed English language detection, also excluding several articles (via review of title and abstract), resulting in 311 records. We performed a more detailed assessment of the articles, and we found 21 studies that met all our criteria for the final stage, excluding reports with minimal evidence, not focused on musculoskeletal pain of the shoulder, or with no outcome measure. ( Figure 1 In order to ensure the best validity and reliability of the study, the two authors assessed the reviews, and all discrepancies were discussed with another reviewer (B.I.M.). We used a quality assessment for our included studies, evaluating the methodology of the study and the risk of bias; in this way, we could easily examine the results in context with the strength of the evidence. 2.4. Risk of Bias We performed the risk of bias analysis for each type of study, as follows: For RCTs/prospective-randomized clinical trials, we used RoB 2 (Cochrane) as an instrument, evaluating the type of randomization, allocation of participants to the study, blinding, loss to follow-up, and selective reporting. For observational/retrospective studies, we used ROBINS-I, and we analyzed participant selection, confounding, intervention classification, loss, and selective reporting. For narrative reviews, we calculated the intrinsic high risk of bias based on literature selection, type of selective reporting, and presence or absence of standardization. For meta-analyses/systematic reviews, we used AMSTAR 2, and we evaluated the inclusion criteria, search strategy, quality assessment of included studies, statistical analysis, and error reporting—see Table 3 Based on the risk of bias table for these articles, we can draw the following conclusions regarding the effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in supraspinatus tendinopathy: 1. Quality of evidence Most studies are narrative reviews and observational studies (retrospective or mechanistic), which have a high risk of bias. This means that their results should be interpreted with caution, as literature selection and selective reporting may exaggerate the positive effects of ESWT. The available RCTs [ 20 22 26 2. Results from meta-analyses Systematic reviews and meta-analyses [ 13 23 28 However, the high heterogeneity between studies (type of ESWT—radial vs. focal, energy, frequency, combinations with physiotherapy) and the variable quality of RCTs lead to a moderate risk of overestimation of effectiveness. 3. Involvement of observational and narrative studies Retrospective studies and narrative reviews generally suggest that ESWT reduces pain and improves function, but these conclusions are more susceptible to bias. Bibliometric and mechanistic studies [ 15 17 4. Overall conclusion regarding the bias risk The efficacy of ESWT in supraspinatus tendinopathy is likely proven, especially for reducing pain and improving function, but Strong clinical evidence is limited to only a few RCTs, which carry a moderate risk of bias. Narrative reviews and observational studies may exaggerate effects. Heterogeneity of the ESWT protocol limits the generalizability of the results. Practical interpretation: ESWT can be considered a therapeutic option, but the level of evidence is moderate, and recommendations should be individualized. Ideally, better-controlled and standardized RCTs are recommended to confirm efficacy and safety. 3. Histological Aspects Regarding Tendon Structure in Pathology This section aims to present a general overview regarding the structural histological aspects of the tendon in pathological conditions. We based this section on the current literature database, including the 21 studies included in our review. The supraspinatus muscle is an important muscle in the shoulder joint that assists in stabilizing the shoulder by reducing the inferior gravitational stresses that the weight of the upper limb exerts downward on the shoulder joint. The supraspinatus muscle abducts the arm at the shoulder by firmly pressing the head of the humerus against the glenoid fossa [ 4 1 4 1 2 4 1 3 3.1. Tendon Structure Tendons, which connect muscle to bone, are flexible, pliable structures. Their primary job is to transmit the force produced by the muscles to the bone system, which makes movement around a joint easier. As a result, they are relatively inert, rigid structures that can withstand strong stresses. Collagen makes up the majority of tendon tissue and is hierarchically parallel to the tendon’s long axis, giving it a high tensile strength. Various non-collagenous proteins are also present in small amounts in the tendon, yet they play crucial physiological roles [ 29 Four structural subunits within the supraspinatus tendon were identified by Fallon et al. after studying the histological morphology of the tendon: (a) the tendon proper, (b) the attachment fibrocartilage (which measures approximately 2.8 cm in length), (c) the rotator cable (an extension of the coracohumeral ligament), and (d) the capsule [ 30 30 31 32 33 Histologically, the attachment fibrocartilage region resembled compressible fibrocartilage. As a perpendicular extension of the coracohumeral ligament, the rotator cable is situated between the tendon and the joint capsule and properly runs parallel to the tendon’s axis [ 32 33 34 31 32 The inferior part of the tendon fuses with the joint capsule around 1 cm before the attachment to the bone. The supraspinatus tendon and muscle both enter the greater tuberosity of the humerus through an opening below the acromion process. The superior portion of the tendon is joined to the coracohumeral and transverse humeral ligaments. The muscle can move the humerus into abduction in this position and location. Together with the deltoid, the supraspinatus plays a role in the movement of abduction at the beginning and throughout the range of motion. It has also been demonstrated that the supraspinatus makes a minor contribution to the humerus’ lateral rotation [ 5 32 The extracellular matrix (ECM) content divides the insertional supraspinatus tendon anatomically into four transitional layered zones: 1. The first zone consists primarily of type I collagen and a modest amount of decorin (proteoglycan associated with collagen, representing a common component of connective tissue and the extracellular matrix). The tendon proper may be thought of as this region. 2. Type II and III collagen make up the majority of the second zone, with trace amounts of type I, IX, and X collagen creating fibrocartilage. 3. Mineralized fibrocartilage made of type II and X collagen, aggrecan (proteoglycan), and other proteins serves as the boundary for the third zone. 4. The effective bone–tendon connection is defined by the collagen fiber orientation in the fourth zone, which is created by type I collagen [ 35 3.2. Tendon Changes in Tendinopathy Although some hypotheses have suggested that tendinopathy occurs by inflammation via the separation of collagen fibers and degeneration from recurrent stress leading to microtrauma, more recent research showed that in some cases (chronic Achilles tendon disease), there is no inflammation present [ 6 36 37 37 The tendon continuum is a new approach that Cook and Purdum have suggested for dealing with tendon pain [ 38 39 38 39 40 38 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 42 43 42 43 49 39 49 51 52 53 54 39 38 47 Figure 2 The pathophysiology of tendinopathies has also been explained by several alternative models. To understand the positive response to loaded therapeutic exercises shown in other studies, Littlewood et al. examined the implications of the central nervous system (CNS) [ 55 56 43 In conclusion, it is challenging to build a simple and robust model that takes into account all facets and phases of the condition due to the complexity of normal tendon structure, the multifaceted nature and magnitude of the tendon’s response to injury, and the obstacles in developing an experimental model that mimics load-related tendon pathology in humans. Whatever the initial event (overstimulation of resident tenocyte, collagen disruption/tearing, inflammation), tendon pathology is defined by a significant cell response to injury. Due to the complexity of these processes and interconnections, it is improbable that any one model can adequately explain all facets of the etiology of tendon pathology and its connections to pain and function. 3.3. Histological Changes Associated with Supraspinatus Tendinopathy Under the microscope, tendinopathy is differentiated from normal tendons by four major changes, as presented in Table 3 57 The histological changes to the tendon (as it can be seen in Table 4 51 53 58 The articular surface of the anterior insertion on the humerus, where the stresses are believed to be the largest, is where lesions of the supraspinatus tendon appear to begin. It has been hypothesized that excessive mechanical pressures at the supraspinatus tendon insertion enhance the rate of collagen synthesis and turnover, which are frequently linked to tendon tears and ruptures [ 2 33 From the cellular point of view, tenocytes, the most prevalent cell type in the tendons, are in charge of maintaining the health of the tendons by secreting ECM and collagen [ 59 42 47 60 61 In regards to whether inflammatory cells are present or absent in tendinopathy, there is still some disagreement. While some researchers claim that degenerating tendons do not include inflammatory cells, others maintain that the emergence of tendinopathy is accompanied by the presence of inflammatory cytokines [ 43 59 62 41 63 64 4. Risk Factors Associated with Tendinopathy Many different etiologic factors seem to contribute to tendon diseases, as is summarized in Figure 3 1 65 33 One explanation for the different types of tendinopathy is that different triggers may start the process, which progressively leads to distorted cell–cell and cell–matrix communication. As a result, the cell and matrix organization of the tendon tissue is lost, inevitably resulting in tendon rupture. In this process, endogenous tendon stem cells and progenitor cells can respond abnormally to signals and choose entry into alternative cell outcomes, which results in tendinous fattening and calcification. Exogenous lineage cells can also be activated, causing vascular and neuronal ingrowth, inflammation, and pain [ 59 1 43 Genetics plays a major role in the majority of intrinsic risk factors for common tendon and ligament problems [ 66 67 68 69 70 71 Aging has been linked to tendinopathy and has been demonstrated to negatively affect tendon characteristics, especially after the age of forty [ 72 39 73 74 One of the main causes of supraspinatus tendinopathy is believed to be impingement syndrome, which is caused by the mechanical compression of the rotator cuff tendons and is influenced by the shape, angle, and existence of acromion–clavicular spurs [ 75 76 34 77 4 77 78 The risk of developing tendinopathy and its poor prognosis have been linked to obesity and its comorbidities, such as hyperglycemia, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia [ 79 80 81 62 79 80 81 82 62 83 43 62 2 2 84 The patient’s age, gender, mobility, and general state of health may also have an impact on the healing process. All things considered, it can be challenging to determine the “one size fits all” or averaged kinetics of the complete tendinopathy process for human populations. Numerous biological characteristics, lifestyle-related factors, pharmaceutical drugs, and other variables are thought to have a significant impact on the development of chronic tendon diseases. In Figure 3 In addition to mechanical challenges, which are considered to be one of the main early causes of tendinopathy, several systemic (intrinsic), highly individualized factors also appear to have an important bearing on tendinopathy. Age and aging, gender, height and weight, dominant arm-affected genetics, hormonal background (such as menopause, pregnancy), pre-existing disorders (such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, adiposity, and chronic gouty arthritis), and prior tendon injuries are thus ranked to influence the biological aspect of tendon pathogenesis by lowering the tendon’s ability to tolerate load and by modulating repair responses [ 54 61 85 86 87 Several extrinsic factors, including environmental factors, are responsible for increased stress on the tendon, including active daily life and professional physically demanding activity, poor nutrition, alcohol abuse, pharmacological agents (e.g., fluoroquinolone and quinolone drugs, corticosteroids, statins, contraceptive medication, and hormone replacement therapy) [ 59 87 88 89 90 91 5. Biological and Therapeutic Effects of Conservative Treatment Using ESWT The supraspinatus has been extensively investigated, since the rotator cuff muscle is most frequently injured. Though this small, but important, muscle has been well documented, much remains to be discovered and learned, particularly since chronic supraspinatus tendinopathy is a prevalent pain syndrome that impairs function and movement in the general population. The conservative treatment of tendinopathies is a must for patients who wish to regain a normal life. We focused our investigation on ESWT, since this component piqued our interest in conducting an actual research study of the literature on conservative treatment. 5.1. Shockwave Therapy—Mechanism of Action For musculoskeletal disorders, shockwave therapy represents an efficient and non-invasive conservative treatment. To alleviate pain and promote tissue repair, ESWT releases growth factor, activates stem cells, promotes anti-inflammatory qualities, and increases blood flow [ 23 Table 5 11 18 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 Extracorporeal shockwave therapy was first used as a noninvasive medical treatment for kidney stones in 1980. Since that time, the area of use has revolutionized to applications for musculoskeletal pathology, the end final stage of ischemic heart disease, prostatitis, neurological pathologies, and wound healing [ 17 18 95 104 105 106 9 107 Cellular mechanisms that transform mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals are known as mechanotransducers. Increased intracellular tension, cellular adhesion, and migration are examples of short-term responses. It is believed that several overlapping and cross-talking signaling pathways can mediate the long-term effect of ESWT [ 101 102 108 The damaged area should receive shockwaves. To locate the area to be treated, palpatory methods or ultrasound localization may be performed. It seems that both choices are equally advantageous [ 109 After reading application protocols throughout the literature, we found that the intensity, pulses, and number of sessions used for shoulder tendinopathy vary [ 110 111 The protocols for rotator cuff (including supraspinous muscle) tendinopathy for ESWT vary in the literature, as noted in Table 6 18 19 20 21 112 In summary, shockwaves reduce pain, aid in tissue repair, and boost bone growth. Nevertheless, we know little about the physiological process by which they produce all these effects. Furthermore, it is quite challenging to determine the number of sessions, the intervals, and the intensity at which ESWT should be applied, considering the wide range of protocols found in the literature. Therefore, additional studies need to present clear methodologies and results to establish guidelines in this sense [ 11 5.2. Shockwave Therapy—Side Effects and Contraindications For the best individualized treatment of our patients, we must first ensure that we use shockwaves safely in order to ensure the best results. In order to reduce risks, next we will list the main contraindications. Contraindications of using shockwave therapy [ 11 18 113 Coagulation disorders; Conditions that promote bleeding; Neurovascular pathologies; Infections; Tumors; Rheumatoid arthritis; Growth plate issues; Pregnancy. Shockwave therapy is widely considered as a safe, non-invasive option for musculoskeletal disorders. As for any therapeutic procedure, in the literature, the studies also mention side effects after ESWT, including pain, local redness, local swelling, mild local inflammation, and erythema on the skin [ 18 6. Summary and Future Scope This narrative review provides an in-depth overview of some of the most recent studies on supraspinous tendinopathy, highlighting tissue damage and the advantages of conservative treatment with shockwave therapy. Numerous tendinopathies of the lower and upper limbs demonstrate the positive effects of ESWT, pointing to the benefits of this conservative procedure [ 11 23 114 As can be seen in Figure 4 We have reviewed the 21 articles included in the study to provide a broad perspective on the use of shockwaves and their promising conservative treatment, both for the histological and clinical stage of supraspinatous tendinopathy. The methodological protocol of ESWT varies significantly in the literature. We focused our review on the benefits produced in the musculoskeletal field, especially for shoulder pathologies. The clinical applications of ESWT can be clearly observed in the paper by Rola et al., published in Biomedicines Figure 5 Due to the confirmed efficacy of ESWT in multiple branches of medicine, it can be used as an adjunct or a standalone therapy [ 114 115 116 12 22 10 ESWT represents an acoustic disturbances that travel through a material carrying energy, with two stages of shockwaves, including a near-instantaneous jump with a tiny pulse width at −6 dB and a high peak positive pressure, sometimes as high as 100 MPa (500 bar) but more frequently between 50 and 80 MPa [ 105 16 19 106 Majidi L. et al, in their meta-analysis published in April 2024, studied many investigations from the literature, evaluating the impact of ESWT used alone or in combination with alternative treatments (other physiotherapy procedures), demonstrating its impact on reducing pain for different types of tendinopathy, using lower intensities and for a long duration of treatment [ 23 As Katz NB et al. pointed out in their article, ESWT may also impact estrogen levels in the body, but ultimately, it yields similar effects on both sexes, female and male [ 117 A study published by Shahabi points out the need for more rigorous study designs by highlighting a critically low protocol evaluation of the effect of ESWT on tendinopathies [ 8 In their review in 2020, Simplicio C et al. mentioned and discussed the efficacy of radial and focused ESWT on many musculoskeletal disorders, including tendinopathy, and they suggest that for severe patients, the results of therapy indicate a low success rate [ 16 In their narrative review published in 2018, Reilly et al. pointed out that in the literature, after performing a blinded placebo ESWT treatment, the evidence of ESWT treatment represents a reasonable treatment for musculoskeletal conditions, with low bias risk [ 18 In 2018, a retrospective study was conducted by Chou Wen-Yi et al. with 36 athletic and non-athletic patients, divided into two groups, and presented a rate of satisfaction of 53.8% and 52.1%, respectively [ 19 In the literature, there are also articles that point out the efficacy of ESWT combined with other conservative procedures, such as kinetotherapy. For example, Frassanito et al. published a randomized controlled trial in 2018, pointing to the significant improvement in both groups during the follow-up and a better improvement in pain on the VAS scale at the end of follow-up ( p 20 Numerous research studies that we reviewed demonstrated a notable improvement in shoulder functional status and pain reduction on the VAS scale, as mentioned by Moya D et al. (2015), Carlisi E. et al. (2018), Majidi L. et al. (2024), and Su X. et al. [ 21 22 23 24 The findings from the literature we evaluated for the use of shockwaves for tendinopathies reinforce the benefits of conservative treatment. Also, ESWT combined with other physiotherapy procedures or kinetotherapy reduces pain significantly better than ESWT used alone. ESWT is now a part of the multimodal, individualized treatment plan in the clinical practice of supraspinous tendinopathies, specifically for patients who do not respond to conservative approaches. Using concepts from the current literature regarding the mechanism of ESWT and its application to tendinopathy disease, we provided a broad overview of studies on the use of shockwaves as a treatment for supraspinous tendinopathy. In conclusion, even if shockwave therapy displays therapeutic potential, cautious optimism should be maintained about its use, and more randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm its therapeutic efficacy in order to improve its indications, parameters, and use in musculoskeletal disorders. 6.1. Strengths All the studies included present specific methodologies regarding shockwave therapy and include quantitative data with reliable, precise, and consistent information. 6.2. Limitations The present paper presents a limitation that may have influenced our conclusion. Initially, we eliminated several studies based on their availability and publishing status, and we might have overlooked pertinent studies that were published in a language other than English. The absence of a rigorous methodology, transparent reporting of results, and a sufficient sample size may have impacted the review’s overall quality. Also, we have limited the quantitative synthesis of our results 7. Conclusions Examining papers from the past 10 years, this review looks at how the supraspinous muscle changes in rotator cuff disease and also intends to point out how conservative rehabilitation treatment, including new procedures such as extracorporeal shockwave therapy, becomes a common substitute for conventional surgical methods, yielding good results and increasing the patient’s quality of life [ 118 The multifaceted pathophysiology of supraspinous tendinopathies, including degenerative alterations, mechanical overload, and compromised healing responses, makes them a complex clinical entity. Recent findings highlight the value of a thorough diagnostic and treatment strategy, with shockwave therapy (ESWT) as a conservative treatment option. According to available data, shockwave therapy has demonstrated significant improvement in function, improving participants’ discomfort, quality of life, and pain relief. It can also be combined with isometric strength exercises. Given the substantial risk of bias and heterogeneity, our findings should be interpreted cautiously. The need for more research to optimize parameters and provide standardized clinical guidelines is highlighted by the variety of treatment procedures. Improving patient outcomes for supraspinous tendinopathies will require a better comprehension of the pathology, and individualized treatment needs to be further investigated. This research supports the necessity for additional long-term monitoring to improve treatment protocols and draw solid conclusions.
