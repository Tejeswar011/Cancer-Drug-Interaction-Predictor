Objective This study aims to assess the global, regional, and national burden of iodine deficiency among women of reproductive age (WRA) from 1990 to 2021. Methods Utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, this study reports age-standardized rates per 100,000 population and average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) in incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLD) of iodine deficiency among WRA, facilitating a comparative analysis of the burden across regions and nations. Moreover, Joinpoint analysis was utilized to assess temporal trends, the slope index and concentration index of inequality were used to assess the health inequality across countries. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model was employed to forecast the burden up to 2044. Results A notable upward trend in the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of iodine deficiency among WRA was observed globally from 1990 to 2021, and this trend is projected to remain relatively stable between 2021 and 2030. The global ASIR increase from 171.3 per 100,000 population (95% CI 122.8, 228.2) in 1990 to 193.6 (95% CI 141.7, 253.2) in 2021 with an AAPC at 0.36 (95% CI 0.26, 0.47). Moreover, the global age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) and age-standardized YLD rate (ASYR) demonstrated decreased trend with the AAPC of −0.31 (−0.35, −0.27) and −1.05 (−1.19, −0.92), respectively. In 2021, countries with low sociodemographic index (SDI) exhibited the highest iodine deficiency burden. The highest burden of iodine deficiency was observed in Central Sub-Saharan Africa, while East Asia exhibited the highest increase in ASIR, ASPR and ASYR. Women of 20–24 years showed the highest increase in the age specific incidence rate globally. The significant absolute and relative health inequality was also observed and the gap has been narrowed. Conclusions Over the past three decades, there has been an overall upward trend in the ASIR of iodine deficiency among WRA globally. Health inequalities related to iodine deficiency was still prominent across countries. Iodine deficiency among WRA remains a significant public health issue. It is crucial to prioritize the development of effective, targeted strategies and implement monitoring mechanisms to enhance the iodine levels among WRA. iodine deficiency epidemiology women of reproductive age Global Burden of Disease incidence The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

This study examines the global epidemiological patterns of iodine deficiency in WRA, highlighting temporal trends, regional age-related variations, and health inequality to emerge a comprehensive assessment of the iodine deficiency burden globally. Materials and methods Data source and case definitions The GBD 2021 provided data on iodine deficiency among WRA of 15–49 years, estimating the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with 371 injuries and diseases, covering 95 maternal, neonatal, nutritional and communicable diseases, 234 non-communicable diseases, and 40 injuries, across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The categorization of countries and territories encompasses 21 regions and seven super regions on the basis of epidemiological similarities and geographic closeness. GBD 2021 study calculated the socio-demographic indexes (SDI) for all countries. SDI is calculated by considering lag-distributed income per capita, average years of educational attainment, and fertility rates in females under 25 years of age ( 21 https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2021/sources 22 23 Cross-country health inequality analysis The health inequality concerning the burden of iodine deficiency was conducted using the absolute slope index and the concentration index ( 23 23 24 Projections of iodine deficiency burden to 2044 The Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model was employed to analyze and forecast trends in the burden of iodine deficiency up to 2044. BAPC uses integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) for full Bayesian inference ( 25 26 Statistical analysis The age-standardized rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated applying direct standardization method by calling the ageadjust.direct function from epitools based on the world standard population from the GBD Study 2021 ( 21 27 28 P Results Global burden of iodine deficiency for WRA in 2021 GBD 2021 estimated that, 2,503,319.6 new cases [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 1,800,060.7, 3,324,741.5], 61,931,118.2 (95% UI 50,490,007.5, 74,375,422.6) prevalent cases and 1,016,939.8 (95% UI 522,768, 1,811,645.9) YLD of iodine deficiency were recorded to have occurred in WRA globally ( Table 1 Table 1 Figure 1 Table 1 Figure 1 Supplementary Figure S1A Supplementary Table S2 Supplementary Figure S3A Supplementary Table S2 Supplementary Figure S3B Supplementary Table S2 Supplementary Figure S3C Supplementary Table S2 Supplementary Figure S3C Figure 1 Association between SDI and age-standardized rates of iodine deficiency among WRA in 2021.

The health inequality in iodine deficiency burden among WRA This study identified notable absolute and relative health inequality in the age–standardized incidence, prevalence and YLDs burden of iodine deficiency. The slope index of inequality showed a narrowing gap in the ASIR of iodine deficiency between countries and territories with the highest and lowest SDI, declining from −240.17 (95% CI −305.77, −174.57) in 1990 to −164.73 (95% CI −218.59, −110.88) in 2021 ( Figure 6A Figure 6B Figure 6C Figure 6D Figure 6E Figure 6F Table 2 Figure 6 Table 2 Health inequalities index of Iodine deficiency burden cross countries from 1990 to 2021.

Projections of iodine deficiency burden to 2044 The global incidence cases of iodine deficiency among reproductive-age women will show an upward trend from 2021 to 2044. The age-standardized incidence rate is projected to remain relatively stable between 2021 and 2030, followed by a slight decline from 2030 to 2044 ( Supplementary Figure S12A Supplementary Figures S12B,C Discussion Based on data from the GBD Study 2021, our research first identified a modest but significant elevation in ASIR of iodine deficiency among WRA globally from 1990 to 2021. This elevation was predominantly observed in 8.33% of the countries analyzed. Moreover, the global age-standardized incidence rate is projected to remain relatively stable between 2021 and 2030. The iodine deficiency burden inversely correlated with the SDI, with the highest ASIR observed among low–SDI countries. Specifically, WRA aged 20–24 years demonstrated the highest increase in age specific incidence rate globally. Notably, the health inequality in iodine deficiency burden has diminished over the past 32 years. These findings provide insights into the epidemiological characteristics of iodine deficiency among WRA, highlighting the need for effective interventions and ongoing monitoring to address the issue from a global perspective. Previous studies have indicated a decline in the global ASIR of iodine deficiency among the general adults and children from 1990 to 2019 ( 15 16 15 29 31 3 5 32 33 The global ASIR of iodine deficiency has significantly increased since 2010, particularly in low-middle SDI countries. Notably, this upward trend was more pronounced in India (APC 2010 − 2015 34 35 While iodine deficiency among WRA exhibited a declining trend in most countries, 8.33% of the countries demonstrated an upward trend. Notably, the Philippines, China, and Pakistan recorded the highest increases in AAPC. Philippines was the only one among 41 middle SDI countries to show an upward trend in the ASIR of iodine deficiency from 1990 to 2021. The ASIR in 2021 was approximately 1.15-fold higher than that in 1990 (AAPC = 2.51). Similar increasing trends were observed in the ASPR and ASYR, with AAPCs of 1.79 (a 73.56% increase from 1990) and 0.79 (a 28.09% increase from 1990), respectively. Furthermore, a slight upward trend in ASIR was observed between 2018 and 2021. A cross-sectional study in the Philippines ( 36 Our study revealed that East Asia exhibited the greatest increases in the ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR among 21 GBD regions. China was the sole country in East Asia to show an upward trend in ASIR from 1990 to 2021, recording the most significant increase in ASIR among 46 high–middle SDI countries, with an AAPC of 1.04 and representing 38.02% increase in ASIR, which is inferior to the Philippines. In China, salt iodization was first implemented in iodine-deficient areas in 1979. Subsequently, a systematic USI policy was implemented nationwide in 1994 in compliance with WHO recommendations, yielding remarkable achievements. However, China's iodine status shift from adequate to excessive between 1997 and 1999 ( 5 P P P 37 38 39 40 Although only 8.33% of countries exhibited an upward trend in the ASIR of iodine deficiency among WRA, the burden remained significant in specific countries. This study identified the highest burden of iodine deficiency among WRA in Central Sub-Saharan Africa across 21 GBD regions. In 2021, The ASIR in Central Sub-Saharan Africa was twice the global average, while the ASPR and ASYR were fivefold higher than global level. Moreover, a study in the Democratic Republic of Congo revealed that approximately 36.3% of pregnant women were exposed to household salt samples with insufficient iodine content (< 15 ppm) ( 41 Among 46 high-middle SDI countries, the highest burden of iodine deficiency among WRA was observed in Italy. The ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR of iodine deficiency in Italy were more than fourfold those in Spain, a Western European country with comparable SDI values. This finding was consistent with results reported in published studies in Italy. One study reported a UIC of 74 μg/L during pregnancy in 2006 ( 42 43 44 Health inequality provides a more comprehensive evaluation of population health shifts compared to merely the average of health indicators ( 25 22 7 Pregnant women require more iodine than the general population due to heightened fetal thyroid hormone synthesis and increased maternal renal clearance. Iodine deficiency in pregnancy has been associated with impaired fetal growth and neurodevelopmental deficits in offspring. While the adverse effects of severe iodine deficiency during gestation are well-established ( 45 An observational study from the ALSPAC cohort revealed that mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency in early pregnancy adversely affected child cognitive development, even in a population with mild iodine deficiency ( 46 47 48 49 50 The limitations of using Grade 2 goiter as an indicator of iodine deficiency in this study should be carefully considered when interpreting the results. Thyroid size reflects long-term iodine nutrition status (accumulated over months to years), and changes in goiter prevalence do not immediately correspond with the current iodine deficiency status ( 1 7 8 Conclusion The incidence of iodine deficiency among women of reproductive age increased significantly globally from 1990 to 2021, with the highest burden observed in low-middle SDI and low SDI quintile countries. Health inequalities in iodine deficiency remained pronounced across countries. The data emphasize the necessity of routinely iodine status monitoring in WRA. Such monitoring, combined with assessments of thyroid function in WRA, should be conducted routinely, and iodine supplementation can be administered when indicated.
