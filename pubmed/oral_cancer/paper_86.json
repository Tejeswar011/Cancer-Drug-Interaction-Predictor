This paper describes HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B testing and diagnosis in young women and men accessing sexual and reproductive health services and identifies opportunities to integrate prevention interventions. Methods The study was conducted in eight primary healthcare and four mobile clinics in South Africa, integrating HIV PrEP within prevention services. Programme data were collected and analysed from women and men ≥15 years accessing services for the first time between June 2023 and March 2024. Results Of 10,007 clients, 89.4% were female and 65.5% 18─24 years. Overall, 70.9% were provided HIV PrEP. Among females, 16.8% were provided contraceptives for the first time. HIV was identified in 1.2% of males and 2.2% of females tested and with results available, syphilis in 5.6% and 5.0%, and hepatitis B in 1.7% and 0.9% respectively. An HIV diagnosis was less likely among older age groups and those enrolled in school and more likely among those with part-time relative to full-time employment. Syphilis was less likely among older age groups and those reporting consistent condom use. Hepatitis B was more likely among those who had used oral PrEP before. Conclusions Opportunities for integrated prevention interventions, aligned to triple elimination, include condom programming, contraception, point-of-care testing, PrEP and vaccination. Integrated care delivered through HIV prevention programmes provides an opportunity to treat and prevent HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B, and offer contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies.

Substantial investment has been made in scaling access to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV, particularly for young women. In South Africa, HIV PrEP is available at over 4,000 health facilities, and the country has initiated almost 1.5 million people on oral PrEP as of May 2024 ( 8 The objectives of this paper are to describe the testing and diagnosis of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B in a population of young women and men accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in eight primary healthcare clinics and four linked mobile clinics in South Africa; and to identify and discuss opportunities for integration of triple elimination efforts with a focus on HIV prevention and SRH programmes. 2 Methods 2.1 Study setting This cross-sectional study is embedded within a large, ongoing Unitaid-funded implementation study (Project PrEP), which is evaluating the introduction of PrEP (including new PrEP methods) in primary healthcare settings through integrated HIV prevention and SRH services, with a focus on girls and young women 15─24 years. The project is implemented in eight fixed Department of Health facilities and four linked mobile clinics in four areas of South Africa: Tshwane (peri-urban area) in Gauteng, Gqeberha (peri-urban area) and Mthatha (rural area) in the Eastern Cape, and eThekwini (urban area) in Kwa Zulu Natal. These sites have been supported by Project PrEP to provide integrated, youth-friendly SRH services since 2018. Sites were selected to participate in Project PrEP based on the incidence of HIV and teenage pregnancy in their surrounding communities, as well as their proximity to learning institutions which serve young people. The first phase of the project supported the introduction of oral PrEP in South Africa and has been described elsewhere ( 9 2.2 Data collection and analysis This study utilized routine programme monitoring and evaluation data from women and men ≥15 years accessing SRH and HIV prevention services through Project PrEP, at their point of entry to project services. Data encompassed client demographics and socio-behavioural characteristics, documented in clinic files by the consulting healthcare provider. Data on pregnancy, contraception use, presence of STI signs and symptoms and STI treatment in the preceding three months were also documented. Additionally, data on the provision and results of rapid point-of-care HIV testing, pregnancy screening, syphilis testing, HBV testing, the initiation of PrEP and the provision of contraception were recorded. HIV testing was provided to consenting clients, following a two-step serial testing algorithm aligned with national HIV Testing Service guidelines ( 10 11 12 We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive analysis of routinely collected data from clients accessing clinical services for the first time at project sites between June 2023 and March 2024. To examine the association between independent variables and the binary dependent variables HIV, syphilis, and HBV test results, while holding other variables constant, we fit multivariable firth's logistic regression models. Given the pronounced imbalance in HIV status (195 HIV-positive vs. 9,219 HIV-negative), syphilis status (168 positive vs. 3,136 negative), and hepatitis B status (32 positive vs. 3,218 negative), Firth's penalized logistic regression was used to correct for bias in maximum likelihood estimates that can arise under such conditions and prevent overfitting ( 13 p 14 3 Results Table 1 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n Table 1 Characteristics of clients accessing SRH and HIV prevention services, by sex.

The likelihood of testing positive for HIV and syphilis decreased with age, highlighting the importance of accessible prevention interventions for adolescents. In keeping with prior studies reporting the protective effect of school completion on HIV acquisition ( 15 16 4.1 Condoms Condoms are the only currently available multipurpose prevention technology, preventing pregnancy, HIV and other STIs; they are cost effective and should be the cornerstone of any integrated prevention package ( 17 18 19 20 21 22 18 23 17 4.2 Contraception Among women presenting for SRH services, opportunity exists to conduct pregnancy screening and provide contraceptive services. As highlighted through our study, almost half of women accessing services were not using any contraceptive at their first visit, but 17% were provided with contraception for the first time through integrated services. South Africa has a high unmet need for contraception, reported at 19% among women of reproductive age in a 2016 Demographic Health Survey ( 24 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 4.3 Point of care screening and testing POC testing for STIs facilitates earlier diagnosis and linkage to treatment, and is acceptable and feasible in low and middle income settings ( 33 34 35 36 South African national guidelines recommend HBV surface antigen screening for all pregnant women during the first trimester ( 37 11 38 39 40 41 42 The use of self-testing may provide further opportunity to reach partners and social networks with screening and testing services, optimising identification, and early treatment of infection to prevent transmission and reinfection. HIV self-test kits are available in South Africa, and secondary distribution has been acceptable in antenatal care settings ( 43 44 4.4 Pre-exposure prophylaxis In keeping with other implementation studies in the region ( 45 46 9 7 47 48 39 49 50 39 49 49 49 4.5 HBV vaccination HBV vaccination has been a key success in combatting hepatitis infection, with widespread adoption of childhood immunization globally ( 40 51 52 40 37 37 39 4.6 Linkage to treatment Linkage to care and treatment for individuals diagnosed with HIV, HBV, or syphilis through SRH programmes should be prioritized and is the second pillar of triple elimination efforts. Ideally this should be provided on the same day, by the same healthcare provider and at the same service point, to facilitate integrated care. National guidelines in South Africa recommend a first line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen which includes TDF and lamivudine (3TC), which has the benefit of treating both HIV and hepatitis B ( 39 53 4.7. Limitations Although this study was conducted across four geographical areas of South Africa, the sampling frame did not include a representative sample of all SRH service users and the findings may not be representative of other contexts, particularly where the burden of HIV, HBV and syphilis differs. These data were collected from healthcare users who had presented for SRH and HIV prevention services and may not fully represent populations who have not accessed or experience barriers to accessing healthcare services. It is also notable that clients known to be living with HIV or who were pregnant would likely have received services at other service points in the clinic, and this data would not be representative of these populations. Incomplete laboratory results, particularly for syphilis and hepatitis B, may also have introduced bias. In addition, the lack of data on treatment outcomes for clients diagnosed with HIV, hepatitis B or syphilis and the cross-sectional study design limits analysis of outcomes and trends over time. The proposed opportunities for integration of triple elimination efforts that are discussed, are drawn from the data in our analysis and literature from the field but would be further supported by implementation research to determine their acceptability, feasibility, and cost effectiveness in specific contexts. 5 Conclusion There are multiple opportunities for integrated prevention interventions, aligned to triple elimination efforts, including condom programming, contraception, POC testing, PrEP and vaccination. Leveraging investments and models of integrated care delivered through HIV prevention programmes focused on girls and young women may provide additional opportunity for triple elimination efforts by treating and preventing HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B prior to women becoming pregnant, in addition to offering integrated contraception services to prevent unintended pregnancies.
