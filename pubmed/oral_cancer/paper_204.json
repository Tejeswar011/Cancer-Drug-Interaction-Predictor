A BSTRACT Actinomycosis is a very peculiar suppurative and fibrosing infection prevalent in the developing countries. Diagnosis of actinomycosis is a challenging and lengthy process because of the vague clinical signs and lack of proper tests in the routine laboratories. Here, we present a very intriguing case of an adult male presenting to the surgery outpatient department (OPD) with a gluteal mass and flank tenderness. The case was investigated with full work up and later, finally diagnosed as a case of psoas abscess due to actinomycetes. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of the chemotherapy in such rare cases will not only negate the deleterious effects of this disease but will also improve the quality of life of the patient. This case report can prove to be an essential guide and aid to the primary care physicians in diagnosing this relatively uncommon pathogen and early intervention in the form of chemotherapy as well as referral to higher centres will prove to be highly beneficial for the patient.

Actinomyces is an anaerobic Gram-positive rod which usually resides on mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts. Mycetoma is a typical manifestation seen due to this particular pathogen. Actinomycosis can virtually infect any part of the human body; but the most common endogenous infections are cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic actinomycosis.[ 1 Psoas muscle abscess is a relatively rare phenomenon and presents clinically as fever, flank pain with decreased mobility and increase in leucocyte counts. Cases of psoas abscess are rare and potentially life-threatening, usually more prevalent in the tropical subcontinent. Majority of the reports of primary psoas abscess are seen in the younger and adolescent age group, while secondary cases are present in the elder patients secondary to pathologies such as tuberculosis, spondylitis, and Crohn’s disease.[ 2 From the perspective of a microbiologist, actinomycetes is a notorious pathogen with varied manifestations starting from a simple lymphocele to florid abscess formation and chronic granulomatous lesions. Hence, the diagnosis of actinomycosis at rare body sites requires a high index of suspicion both on the part of treating physicians as well as the laboratory microbiologists investigating the case.[ 2 Here, we present a very intriguing case of an adult male presenting to the surgery outpatient department (OPD) with a gluteal mass and flank tenderness. The case was investigated with full work up and later, finally diagnosed as a case of psoas abscess due to Actinomycetes. Case Report A 44-year-old man, shopkeeper by profession presented to the outpatient department (OPD) of General Surgery with chief complains of pain in the abdomen since last 20 days. The pain was insidious in onset, gradually progressive, associated with fever which was high grade, undocumented, and associated with chills and rigors. On further enquiring, the patient informed that the pain was not radiating or migrating and there was no urinary hesitancy and pain during micturition Past history was insignificant in the form of any trauma or surgeries and also no similar complaints were reported by the patient. Family History was insignificant and he was not on any long-term medications. In the hospital course, the said patient was admitted in the ward with the above complaints and a thorough clinical examination and all necessary investigations were taken. Contrast enhanced CT (CECT) scan showed hepatomegaly as well as bulky right psoas muscle with large amount of collection in the right psoas muscle extending up to the level of the right acetabulum and a small amount of fluid collection in adjacent part of the right retroperitoneal space, with a small amount of fluid collection in the right quadratus lumborum muscle and adjacent posterior part of the right transverse abdominis muscles. Based on the above findings a differential diagnosis of Intramuscular hematomas or Abscesses was made. Ultrasonography (USG) on subsequent day revealed Hepatomegaly, Right renal cortical cysts and Right-sided psoas abscess likely. Evidence of a large anechoic cystic collection measuring 16 × 13 × 9 cm with a volume of 1042 mL was noted adjacent to the right kidney. The lesion showed dense internal coarse echoes and debris within it. Hence, it was likely a Right-sided psoas abscess and was planned for USG guided Pigtail insertion to drain abscess. USG guided Pigtail insertion to drain abscess was done and almost 1500 ml of pus was drained out and sent for microbiological cultures [ Figure 1 Figure 1 Image showing pig tail insertion in the flank region for psoas abscess drainage Gram stain of the sample yielded multiple gram positive filaments, both branching and beaded forms. Further, modified ZN staining revealed the structures to be non- acid fast; thus excluding the possibility of Nocardia species [ Figure 2a b Figure 3a b Figure 2 (a and b) Staining showing branching filaments of Actinomyces. Above-Gram stain, Below- Modified Z N stain (Encircled area) Figure 3 (a and b) Media showing colony characteristics of Actinomyces species. Above- SDA media; Below-Chocolate Agar (Arrows point towards the colonies) Further, gram as well as modified ZN staining ruled out the possibility of Nocardia species and strengthened the possibility of Actinomyces species as gram positive, non-acid fast, filamentous bacteria. The colonies were further subjected to species identification using various biochemical tests as: Indole, methyl red, urease, casein, xanthine, nitrate reductase and hypoxanthine to see the hydrolysis of media, utilization of acetamide, citrate, L-rhamnose and D-sorbitol. Based on the cultural, morphological, and biochemical reactions the isolate was identified as Actinomyces species Antibiotic susceptibility testing was further done and the isolate was found sensitive to ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin clavulanate, Clindamycin, Minocycline, Linezolid and was resistant to meropenem and other carbapenems. The patient was started on high dose penicillin G intravenously for 5 days followed by oral Amoxycillin -clavulanic acid with clindamycin for 3 weeks. Significant improvement was noted in the abscess and almost no pain in the flank within two months of treatment. The patient was advised further follow up after a month in OPD with oral antibiotics and multivitamins. Discussion Actinomycosis is a very peculiar tropical infection comprising of suppurative and granulomatous fibrosing infestations. This unique infection is much more prevalent in the developing countries, and threefold higher in men compared with women (except the pelvic form).[ 3 4 The major risk factors implicated in the cases of actinomycosis include poor oral hygiene, alcoholism, the use of IUD, and some immunocompromised conditions such as diabetes mellitus and the use of immunosuppressive agents.[ 5 6 7 8 Definite diagnosis of actinomycosis basically relies on either the culture report or histopathology of the infected tissue or organ.[ 9 7 8 9 The drug of choice would consist of a β- lactam and a β-lactamase inhibitor. Doxycycline, clindamycin, and erythromycin can be tried as alternative agents in cases of β-lactam allergy. Usually, oral antibiotic therapy should be maintained for about 2 to 6 months in mild cases and 6 to 12 months for severe cases. For abdominopelvic form of actinomyces infection, surgery is reserved only for complicated cases such as an extensive abscess. As, in our case the case was managed by draining the abscess first by pig tail insertion and later, the antibiotic course followed, leading to a favourable outcome in the patient.[ 9 10 Advancements in culture and widespread use of novel techniques like MALDI-TOF, real-time PCR, and multiplex PCR have led to the marked reporting and diagnosing of such rare actinomyces infections.[ 11 12 Conclusion Actinomycosis a rare and neglected infection of the tropical developing countries. It is varied clinical presentation and lack of timely diagnosis and initiation of therapy, results in unfavourable outcomes. High degree of suspicion on the part of treating clinicians and diagnosing lab personnel’s is required for early diagnosis and prompt initiation of the chemotherapy as it will not only negate the deleterious effects of this disease but will also improve the quality of life of the patient. The current study highlights the importance of primary care physicians in counselling and educating the patients as well as identifying their possible risk factors which will help to mitigate the effects of this rare filamentous bacterial pathogen.
