Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, epithelial barrier dysfunction, gut microbiota imbalance, and immune dysregulation. Clinically, UC is characterized by bloody diarrhea, mucosal inflammation, and a relapsing-remitting course, with diagnosis typically confirmed by clinical, endoscopic, histological, and laboratory findings. Despite the increasing number of therapeutic options, including corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologics, many patients still experience suboptimal responses or adverse events, and some ultimately require colectomy. In this context, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has attracted attention as a complementary approach due to its multi-target mechanisms and historical use in gastrointestinal diseases. This review summarizes recent evidence on the application of TCM in UC, including its theoretical foundations, active compounds, and modulation of key signaling pathways such as TLR4/NF-κB, NLRP3, JAK/STAT3, PI3K/Akt, Notch, and AMPK/mTOR. Additionally, we highlight clinical data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating TCM formulas either as monotherapy or in combination with conventional treatments. Some studies report improvements in symptom scores, inflammatory markers, and endoscopic healing when TCM is combined with agents like mesalazine. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution. Most RCTs are single-center with small sample sizes, lack placebo control, and show considerable heterogeneity in intervention protocols and outcome assessments, making quantitative comparisons to standard therapies, such as remission rates or adverse event frequencies relative to mesalazine or biologics, being limited. Therefore, while TCM demonstrates therapeutic potential in UC management, more rigorous evidence is needed to establish its comparative efficacy and safety. Future studies should include large-scale, multicenter, placebo-controlled RCTs with standardized endpoints, and consider integrating TCM syndrome differentiation with modern pathophysiological frameworks to enhance clinical relevance and translational value.

Its incidence has increased globally over recent decades, posing a substantial burden on healthcare systems and patients’ quality of life. 1 2 3 Mesalazine is recognized as the primary treatment for mild-to-moderate UC, while topical and systemic corticosteroids are used for recurrent cases. For moderate to severe manifestations of the disease, immunosuppressants and biologics are used. 4 5 6 7 The use of TCM herbal compounds for UC is supported by empirical clinical practice and increasingly by experimental studies demonstrating anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and barrier-protective effects, which are often mediated through modulation of signaling pathways, including TLR4/NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome, JAK/STAT3, PI3K/Akt, and Notch. 8 9 Additionally, potential herb-drug interactions and the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with certain TCM formulations warrant careful consideration. The lack of regulatory standardization, variability in plant sourcing and extraction methods, and insufficient reporting of adverse events further complicate clinical translation. These issues highlight the importance of evaluating TCM interventions not only based on traditional use but also in accordance with modern pharmacological principles and clinical trial standards. Based on these considerations, this review examines how TCM may contribute to the treatment of UC by summarizing recent findings from molecular studies, experimental research, and clinical trials. The discussion aims to relate TCM principles to known pathophysiological mechanisms of UC and to evaluate current evidence on efficacy and safety. In doing so, we aim to clarify the relevance of TCM in UC management and highlight existing challenges, such as limited pharmacokinetic data and regulatory variability, to guide future research. Clinical Signs In UC, the manifestation of symptoms typically occurs in a gradual manner and can persist for several weeks to months. Following the initial period of morbidity, if therapeutic interventions prove ineffective, the disease trajectory is marked by episodes of recurrent mucosal inflammation interspersed with periods of symptom remission. Common clinical manifestations include diarrhea, hematochezia, and difficulties with defecation. The likelihood of UC diagnosis is heightened in patients with a prolonged history of bloody diarrhea and nocturnal bowel movements. UC is frequently associated with distal conditions, such as proctitis and proctocolitis, where patients may predominantly experience rectal bleeding, tenesmus, and defecation challenges. Notably, paradoxical constipation may occur in up to 10% of individuals with rectal or left-sided colitis. 10 Acute weight loss is prevalent in pediatric populations; however, linear growth is often preserved, in contrast to Crohn’s disease, which typically impairs linear growth. 11 12 12 Approximately 30% of individuals diagnosed with UC exhibit extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs). 13 14 15 16 17 18 14 19 Figure 1 Figure 1 Clinical manifestations of UC. Diagnosis In the evaluation of UC, clinicians must establish a comprehensive differential diagnosis. A thorough medical history should be obtained, encompassing inquiries regarding travel history, medication use, including antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tobacco exposure, and recent hospitalizations. 20 20 21 22 23 24 25 21 25 26 When evaluating patients exhibiting symptoms of UC, it is essential to consider additional conditions such as malignancy, bleeding hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, vasculitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. 12 20 Patients diagnosed with UC should undergo a comprehensive physical examination to evaluate extraintestinal manifestations associated with the condition. The presence of pallor may serve as an indicator of anemia. 20 Preliminary laboratory assessments should encompass a comprehensive blood count, electrolyte levels, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function evaluations, iron studies, vitamin D concentrations, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin levels, and stool analyses for microbial infections, with a particular emphasis on Clostridium difficile. 27 28 Laboratory indicators have been investigated as potential markers for assessing the disease activity and severity. Notably, serum CRP levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates can remain within normal ranges in patients with severe UC. 29 30 31 Colonoscopy is considered to be a fundamental method for the diagnosis of UC. However, the exclusive use of endoscopy to differentiate IBD from non-IBD colitis presents certain limitations, necessitating additional clinical and histological information to enhance the diagnostic accuracy. It is recommended that an ileocolonoscopy be conducted, with a minimum of two biopsies 32 33 34 Microscopic examination should be conducted by a pathologist with specialized knowledge in Gastroenterology. 21 34 32 Figure 2 Figure 2 Diagnosis of UC. Pathophysiology The existing literature predominantly focuses on comparing the pathophysiological mechanisms of UC with those of Crohn’s disease; however, significant distinctions between the two conditions remain. The morbidity mechanisms associated with UC are closely linked to defects in colonic epithelial cells, mucosal barrier, and epithelial barrier. Notably, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), which serves as a negative regulator of NF-κB-dependent inflammation, is diminished in colonic cells derived from UC patients, indicating a potential causal relationship. 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses to microbial antigens in individuals with UC are well documented. Patients diagnosed with UC exhibit an increased accumulation of neutrophils and deployment of chromatin-based extracellular traps at sites of mucosal injury within the colon, which contribute to the persistence of inflammation by enhancing the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). 46 47 48–50 Atypical responses of effector T helper (Th) cells and imbalances in T regulatory cells lead to the dysregulated production of several critical cytokines, thereby shifting the therapeutic focus of UC towards anti-cytokine agents. The cytokines involved include TNF, interferon-gamma, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22, all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of UC through various mechanisms. 51 52 53 Humoral immune responses remain relatively under-explored. A recent investigation into the molecular and phenotypic attributes of intestinal and circulating B cells identified significant disruptions, characterized by a reduction in both diversity and maturity. 54 The gastrointestinal microbiota has been associated with UC. 55 44 56 57 The expression levels of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 are elevated in the colonic cells and lamina propria of individuals with active UC; however, the relationship between mucosal inflammation and the increased expression of these receptors remains ambiguous, as it is uncertain whether inflammation is a causative factor or a resultant effect. 58 59 60 48 Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of IBD. 61 62 Elevated levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and nuclear IgG have been documented in individuals diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. However, a disproportionate increase in IgG1 antibodies has been observed specifically in patients with UC. The role of B cells in contributing to disease morbidity remains ambiguous, as it is uncertain whether they are active participants in pathogenesis or merely reactive to disruptions in the intestinal barrier. Preliminary findings indicate that UC may be characterized as a Th2 disorder, whereas Crohn’s appears to be associated with Th1 responses. Analysis of colonic lamina propria cells from patients with UC revealed the presence of Th2-polarized T cells that produce IL-5. 63 64 65 66 One study reported a novel subset of CD4-positive Th cells that are influenced by transcription factor PU.1, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of UC. 67 Lastly, recent advances have highlighted the complex interplay between genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, immune responses, and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of UC. Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous UC-related loci, such as those involved in epithelial barrier integrity (eg, HNF4A, ECM1) and immune regulation (eg, IL23R, NOD2), which predispose individuals to dysregulated mucosal immunity. 68 69 69 70 71 Pathophysiological Mechanisms of TCM in the Treatment of UC UC is classified within the framework of TCM as a form of “chronic dysentery” and is associated with the “intestine”. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying UC are characterized by complex interactions across multiple systems and levels. According to TCM, the fundamental cause of this condition is attributed to deficiencies in the spleen and kidney, whereas the accumulation of dampness, heat, blood stasis, and toxins represents a more superficial manifestation. These factors are interrelated and contribute to a pathological cascade involving qi stagnation, blood stasis, and fluid retention. 72 Research has demonstrated that the excessive activation of inflammatory cells and the aberrant release of inflammatory mediators are central to the pathogenesis of UC. 73 74 75 76 77 The NLRP3 signaling pathway represents a significant intracellular signal transduction mechanism, comprising NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and pro-caspase-1. Research has demonstrated a strong association between NLRP3 and UC onset and progression. This pathway exacerbates intestinal inflammation and damage by modulating the expression of proteins involved in inflammatory responses and apoptosis, thereby influencing the course of UC. 78 79 80 81 81 The JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway represents a critical intracellular transduction mechanism for JAK and STAT cytokines, which are essential for the regulation of gene transcription. This pathway plays a significant role in various biological processes, including immune regulation, inflammatory responses, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. 82 83 84 85 86 Triptolide, the principal active compound derived from Tripterygium wilfordii, exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. ZT01, a novel derivative of triptolide, has been shown to mitigate the toxicity associated with triptolide while preserving its pharmacological efficacy. 87 88 89 90 91 The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway primarily comprises phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt. Dysregulated activation of this pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of UC, contributing to inflammation, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. PI3K activates Akt by generating phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3), which subsequently interacts with phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt. Akt serves as a pivotal component in cellular signaling, modulating processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation 92 93 94 Rhein, the principal bioactive compound derived from rhubarb, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-fibrotic properties. Research conducted by Dong et al 95 Paeoniflorin, 96 97 Additionally, Astragalus polysaccharide, an active component of Astragalus membranaceus, has been shown by Zhao et al 98 The Notch signaling pathway, which encompasses DNA-binding proteins, Notch receptors, and Notch ligands, is integral to the regulation of intestinal stem cell differentiation and proliferation, maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis, and preservation of antimicrobial function in intestinal epithelial cells. 99 100 101 Aloesin A, an active compound derived from aloe, has been shown to protect the mucosal barrier by inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway, resulting in the decreased expression of Notch1, Hes1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in murine models of UC, while simultaneously enhancing the expression of ATOH1, MUC2, IL-10, ZO-1, and Occludin. This modulation reduces inflammation and mitigates the progression of UC. 102 103 104 Figure 3 Figure 3 Pathophysiological mechanism of ulcerative colitis (UC). Green arrows indicate the activation or upregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways (TLR4, NF-κB, NLRP3) and downstream cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6). Red arrows represent the downregulation of the anti-inflammatory factor PPAR-γ. These changes lead to immune activation and gut microbiota dysbiosis, contributing to intestinal inflammation in UC. Cross-Talk and Coordination Among Signaling Pathways Regulated by TCM in UC The signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of UC, including NF-κB, JAK/STAT3, NLRP3, PI3K/Akt and Notch, have been shown to not function independently but instead form an interconnected regulatory network, which orchestrates key biological processes such as mucosal inflammation, epithelial barrier function, and immune regulation. 105 106 107 108 Several TCM formulations may also exert coordinated effects on these interrelated pathways. For instance, Gegen Qinlian Decoction has been shown to simultaneously inhibit NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 signaling in DSS-induced colitis models, resulting in reduced expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, as well as improved epithelial barrier integrity. 109 110 Collectively, these interconnected signaling pathways highlight the importance of examining TCM-based treatment for UC from a systems biology perspective. Future research should focus on elucidating the hierarchical organization and regulatory interactions among these pathways, and on determining how specific herbs or multi-component TCM prescriptions modulate this network to exert comprehensive and sustained therapeutic effects. Treatment of UC with TCM Gao et al 111 Gao et al 112 Cao et al 113 Figure 4 Figure 4 Mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating UC. Green arrows indicate TCM-induced upregulation of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin), T cell modulation, and barrier repair. Red arrows indicate downregulation of inflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) via signaling pathway adjustment. Although numerous clinical studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of TCM in UC, most are single-center and small-sample RCTs. While such studies provide important preliminary evidence, their limited sample sizes and lack of multicenter design may reduce generalizability and increase the risk of sampling bias. To date, high-quality, large-scale multicenter RCTs evaluating the efficacy and safety of TCM interventions in UC remain scarce. Furthermore, systematic reviews and meta-analyses integrating existing data are also limited. Therefore, future research should prioritize the design and implementation of rigorously conducted multicenter trials, along with comprehensive evidence synthesis approaches, to enhance the reliability and clinical applicability of TCM-based treatments for UC. TCM Combined Therapy for UC Chen et al 114 Fan et al 115 Ye et al 116 Figure 5 Figure 5 Comprehensive treatment strategy combining traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. Green arrows indicate positive outcomes, such as an increased remediation rate. Red arrows indicate reductions in key clinical indicators, including Mayo endoscopic score, recurrence rate, and complications. This combined approach achieves synergistic anti-inflammatory effects and promotes intestinal barrier repair. Practical Considerations for Clinical Integration of TCM Treatment To facilitate the integration of TCM into clinical practice for UC, it is important to consider treatment strategies tailored to different disease stages and severities. In the active stage, where inflammation and symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia are prominent, TCM interventions often focus on resolving heat, dampness, and pathogenic factors. For example, modified Gegen Qinlian Decoction has been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in patients with large intestine damp-heat syndrome. 117 118 119 In the remission stage, therapeutic goals shift toward stabilizing the disease, maintaining mucosal healing, and preventing relapse. Shenling Baizhu Powder has been used in this context, particularly for patients with spleen deficiency and dampness accumulation, by modulating the Th17/Treg balance and enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. 120 Regarding disease severity, patients with mild to moderate UC generally respond well to oral TCM formulations, either as monotherapy or as adjuncts to standard treatments. In contrast, those with severe disease may require a combined regimen incorporating TCM and conventional agents such as mesalazine or immunosuppressants to achieve symptom control and mucosal repair. 9 121 Innovative Mechanisms and Emerging Research Directions in TCM Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis Recent advances in TCM research have identified various innovative mechanisms that offer new perspectives on UC treatment, complementing traditional theories with modern biomedical insights. One notable direction involves the regulation of ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent programmed cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation. Studies have demonstrated that TCM monomers such as curculigoside can upregulate GPX4 expression, enhance intracellular glutathione synthesis, and reduce malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, thereby suppressing ferroptosis in DSS-induced colitis models. 122 Curcuma longa 122 123 In parallel, the gut microbiota and its metabolites have emerged as critical mediators of TCM’s therapeutic effects in UC. Metabolomic profiling of TCM-treated models has revealed altered levels of uric acid and other key metabolites following administration of Shaoyao Decoction, with significant changes observed in both proximal and distal colonic tissues. 124 125 Another emerging focus is the modulation of the gut-brain axis, wherein TCM interventions exert neuroimmune regulatory effects. Herbal treatments targeting serotonin (5-HT) signaling have shown promise in alleviating both gastrointestinal symptoms and mood disturbances associated with UC. 125 Beyond single mechanisms, TCM compounds are capable of regulating multiple types of programmed cell death (PCD), including apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. For instance, curcumin not only inhibits ferroptosis but also modulates autophagic processes by downregulating Atg12, Beclin-1, and LC3II expression in colonic epithelial cells, 126 Importantly, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and network pharmacology is accelerating the identification of novel TCM targets in UC. Wu et al employed machine learning to construct a compound-target-pathway network based on metabolomic data of Shaoyao Decoction, identifying key molecular targets such as STAT3, IL-1B, IL-6, AKT1, and ICAM1, and confirming high-affinity interactions with active metabolites including quercetin, baicalin, kaempferol, and wogonin. 127 128 Building on these advances, these advances reflect a broader trend in TCM research toward the integration of high-throughput technologies and data-driven methodologies, contributing to a more refined and scientifically grounded approach to UC management. Conclusion While current therapies for UC, including biologics and small-molecule inhibitors, have improved disease control, issues such as high cost, limited accessibility, and long-term safety concerns remain. In this regard, TCM, with its multi-target and multi-pathway regulatory properties, offers a potential complementary approach. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have shown that TCM can reduce inflammation, regulate immunity, and protect the intestinal barrier by modulating pathways such as NF-κB, JAK/STAT3, PI3K/Akt, and NLRP3. However, the clinical translation of TCM is limited by the lack of direct comparisons with standard therapies and insufficient data on pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and long-term safety. Few studies have evaluated how TCM compares to biologics or small molecules in terms of efficacy, cost, and accessibility. Furthermore, most clinical trials remain small, single-center studies without standardized endpoints. To strengthen the role of TCM in modern UC management, future research could adopt a more rigorous and translational framework, such as designing multicenter randomized controlled trials that directly compare TCM interventions with standard therapies such as biologics and small-molecule inhibitors. In addition to efficacy endpoints, future studies could incorporate dose-finding protocols, pharmacodynamic assessments, and long-term safety monitoring. The integration of biomarker-based patient stratification, such as inflammatory profiles, microbiota composition and genetic susceptibility, could improve the precision of TCM application. Furthermore, aligning TCM syndrome differentiation with internationally accepted disease classification systems may enhance its clinical relevance. To elucidate the molecular basis of TCM efficacy, network pharmacology, high-throughput screening, and multi-omics approaches could also be applied. Together, these strategies may provide a more comprehensive understanding of TCM mechanisms and support its safe and evidence-based inclusion in contemporary treatment strategies for UC.
