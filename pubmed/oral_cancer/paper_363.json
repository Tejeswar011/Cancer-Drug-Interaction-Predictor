Previous investigations have indicated a declining trend in HFMD incidence and a shift towards later age of onset [ 10 11 This study aimed to explore the trends in HFMD incidence among different gender and age cohorts in Guangzhou from 2013 to 2023. We utilized Joinpoint regression modeling to assess changes in incidence rates among these groups. Additionally, we employed a SARIMA model to analyze case trends and project the incidence rate for subsequent two years. Our findings will support health authorities in refining HFMD prevention and control strategies, enabling them to adjust their public health priorities for a more effective response to the epidemic. Methods Study area Guangzhou, situated at coordinates 22°26′-23°56′N and 112°57′-114°3′E in southern China, lies at the northern periphery of the Pearl River Delta, adjacent to the South China Sea. As the capital of Guangdong Province, it serves as a pivotal center for trade, commerce, and transportation in South China. Renowned for its rich cultural diversity, Guangzhou attracts a significant number of immigrants from both domestic and international backgrounds. This substantial influx of population results in a pronounced occurrence of infectious diseases, notably including one of the highest rates of HFMD in China. Data collection Data regarding cases of HFMD, including fundamental demographic information (sex, date of birth), disease severity (classified as mild or severe), and key dates (symptom onset and diagnosis where applicable), were extracted from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System for the period 01/01/2013 to 31/12/2023. These data were accessed for research purposes on 20/08/2024. No personally identifiable information was collected or retained during or after the study. Annual demographic statistics stratified by gender and age group for the same period were sourced from the Guangzhou Statistical Yearbook 12 Statistical methods Joinpoint regression. The Joinpoint regression model is employed for trend analysis in time series data or other ordered data, and it finds extensive application in epidemiological trend studies [ 13 14 S1 File By calculating the annual percent change (APC), average annual percent change (AAPC), and their 95% confidence intervals ( CI P 15 SARIMA model. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, established in the early 1970s by George Box in the United States and Gwilym Jenkins in the United Kingdom, is a prominent tool for predicting infectious diseases [ 16 18 The model was developed using R software (version 4.4.0) with the packages “tseries,” “forecast,” “ggplot2,” and “Metrics.” The optimal model was selected using the “auto.arima” function, where a two-tailed P Results Epidemiological overview of hand, foot, and mouth disease Between 2013 and 2023, Guangzhou documented a cumulative total of 694,145 cases of HFMD, resulting in an average annual incidence rate of 403.60 per 100,000 individuals. Among these cases 20 were categorized as severe. The incidence of HFMD demonstrated biennial peaks and pronounced seasonality. With the exception of 2020, each year exhibited a bimodal distribution. Cases were recorded across all age demographics, with children under the age of five representing 92.35% of the overall cases ( Fig 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0333544.g001 Fig 1 Temporal distribution of HFMD incidence in Guangzhou from 2013 to 2023. The figure illustrates the monthly number of cases (blue bars) and the corresponding incidence rate per 100,000 population (orange line) from 2013 to 2023. The x-axis is marked by years and key monthly intervals (e.g., “1 5 9” denotes the 1st, 5th, and 9th months within each year), depicting the temporal trends and cyclical fluctuations in disease occurrence over the decade. Analysis of trends in HFMD incidence rates Gender-based trends in incidence rates. During the study period (2013–2023), the reported incidence rate of HFMD in Guangzhou remained stable, with an AAPC of −2.64% that lacked statistical significance ( P Fig 2 P 10.1371/journal.pone.0333544.g002 Fig 2 Gender-specific incidence trends of HFMD in Guangzhou from 2013 to 2023. The figure depicts the temporal trends in disease incidence (per 100,000 population) between 2013 and 2023, analyzed using Joinpoint regression and stratified by gender (male, female) as well as the overall population. The blue dots and their connecting line represent the overall population; green triangles and their connecting line denote males; and black dots and their connecting line signify females. All groups exhibit “0 Joinpoints,” indicating a single linear trend over the period. Furthermore, this visualization captures the year-on-year changes in the data between males and females during this period. Trends in incidence rates by age groups. The analysis indicates that the incidence rates of HFMD in Guangzhou display notable trends when evaluated across different age categories.

This figure depicts the spatiotemporal dynamics of disease cases from 2013 to 2025. The black curve represents the actual historical case counts over the period 2013–2023. The blue curve and its surrounding shaded area correspond, respectively, to the projected case counts for 2024–2025 and their associated confidence intervals. Discussion This study employed the Joinpoint regression model and the SARIMA model to analyze the epidemic trends of HFMD in Guangzhou from 2013 to 2023, and to forecast the outbreak trajectories over the subsequent two years. The findings indicate that while the overall incidence rate remained relatively stable during the research period, notable disparities in incidence trends were observed across different age groups. Epidemiological trend analysis of HFMD in Guangzhou over the 11-year period from 2013 to 2023 demonstrates a non-significant downward tendency in the average annual percentage change of incidence. This trend exhibits consistency with the epidemiological pattern observed in Jiangsu Province, China during 2009–2023, while showing divergence from that recorded in Shanghai between 2011–2021 [ 19 20 11 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 This study further investigates HFMD incidence trends across different gender groups. Results from Joinpoint regression analysis demonstrate that the AAPC estimates of incidence rates for both males and females yield no statistically significant differences. This suggests that prior interventions have a minimal impact on the gender differences observed. Current interventions primarily encompass population-wide strategies, including health education, vaccination initiatives, and non-pharmaceutical measures such as hand hygiene practices. Existing research indicates no significant gender-based disparities in adherence to these intervention measures [ 29 24 30 31 32 32 Furthermore, this study elucidates the long-term incidence trends of HFMD across different age groups. The findings reveal a significant decline in HFMD incidence among children aged 1 year and younger, as well as those in the 1-year-old age group. Conversely, a significant upward trend has been observed in the incidence among children aged 6 years and older. This age-specific pattern is consistent with previous nationwide studies in China, which have indicated an increasing prevalence of HFMD among populations aged 3 years and older [ 11 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 42 In addition to analyzing historical incidence trends, this study employed SARIMA models to forecast future HFMD dynamics. The forecasting results indicated that after reaching a peak in 2023, the number of HFMD cases is expected to show a declining trend, which aligns with the historical pattern of HFMD experiencing periodic peaks approximately every other year. Nevertheless, the projected case numbers remain at relatively elevated levels, emphasizing the importance of sustained monitoring and preventive measures to prevent the occurrence of large-scale outbreaks in the future. Based on the comprehensive findings of this study, several targeted recommendations are proposed. Firstly, enhanced surveillance of HFMD cases should be implemented for children aged six years and older, with particular focus on school environments and extracurricular activity settings, accompanied by the enforcement of more stringent preventive protocols. Secondly, there is an urgent need to optimize vaccine strategies, including accelerating the research, development, and promotion of vaccines targeting CVA6 and CVA10, to effectively reduce the transmission of HFMD caused by non-EV71 enteroviruses. Additionally, public health intervention measures should be further strengthened, with specific emphasis on promoting good personal hygiene practices among preschool and school-aged populations. This includes advocating for regular handwashing, improving environmental cleanliness standards, and minimizing close contact in high-risk groups to mitigate the risk of viral transmission. This study has certain limitations. Firstly, the HFMD cases analyzed may only represent a fraction of the actual infections and cases within the population. Due to the recent decrease in severe cases, some patients with mild symptoms may not seek medical treatment, resulting in an apparent decline in HFMD trends. Nevertheless, HFMD case data were extracted from China’s National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System, a comprehensive and authoritative surveillance platform. We made strenuous efforts to maximize the inclusion of all reported cases during the study period, thereby enhancing the reliability of our results. While we acknowledge the potential underreporting of mild cases, this national surveillance system still provides a robust foundation for capturing the overall epidemiological trends of HFMD. Secondly, given that HFMD cases predominantly occur among children, the reported decline in case numbers may also correlate with the decreasing birth rate in Guangzhou, which may not accurately reflect the actual temporal trends. However, Joinpoint analysis employed age-stratified incidence rates, with age-specific population data used as denominators for each group. This methodological approach effectively accounted for the impact of birth rate fluctuations on the structure of the susceptible population, thereby minimizing interference from underlying population changes. Conclusions From 2013 to 2023, the incidence rate of HFMD in Guangzhou has shown a consistent trend, primarily impacting children under five years of age. Nevertheless, this overall consistency obscures notable variations among different age demographics; specifically, the incidence rates for infants under one year and children aged one have demonstrated a downward trajectory, while there has been an increase in rates for children aged six years and older. Predictions suggest that HFMD cases may decrease and stabilize over the next two years. It is essential to continually enhance surveillance efforts and implement comprehensive public health interventions to facilitate the timely identification of shifts in disease trends. This approach will aid health authorities in refining control strategies and aligning public health priorities, thus ensuring more effective responses to HFMD outbreaks.
