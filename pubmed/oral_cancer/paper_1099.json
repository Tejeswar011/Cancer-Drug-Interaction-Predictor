Red Ginseng—Introduction Panax ginseng Panax 1 Panax P. ginseng 2 Panax 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 3 4 4 One such population is those with alcohol use disorder (AUD). AUD is a widespread concern, estimated to affect 28.9 million people over the age of 12 in the U.S. based on the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), and is estimated to be implicated in 3.8% of all global deaths [ 5 6 7 8 8 9 10 7 10 11 1 8 11 Recently, interest has been growing in KRG’s potential to mitigate several of AUD’s pathophysiological processes. Ginsenosides, the primary bioactive components of KRG, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anxiolytic, and neuroprotective effects in many preclinical studies and some human trials [ 7 8 10 2 3 4 6 7 12 13 14 15 16 2 3 4 12 To conduct this narrative review, the authors used various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Sciences to find relevant literature. Some examples of search terms include the following: Panax ginseng Panax ginseng 2. Red Ginseng—Active Constituents and Mechanism of Action Ginsenosides, ginseng’s primary bioactive constituents, are built on a steroid-like skeleton with a wide variety of side chains, differentiating them into over 180 documented types [ 1 7 1 17 1 10 18 19 7 10 10 10 Figure 1 10 The versatility of ginsenosides’ therapeutic applications can be attributed to the compounds’ capacity to impact a plethora of cellular and biochemical mechanisms [ 1 8 12 13 8 8 14 2.1. Interference in Alcohol Absorption and Metabolism When consumed orally, ethanol is absorbed through epithelial cells in the GI tract, then enters the bloodstream, and eventually gets transported to the liver. Here, ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which is then converted to acetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) [ 2 15 2 12 Ginsenosides play a multifactorial role in combating these physiological changes induced by alcohol use, with a plethora of sources citing KRG extract’s ability to decrease ethanol absorption in the GI tract [ 7 16 20 21 21 More recent work suggests that ginseng may additionally speed up the metabolism of alcohol in the blood by promoting the expression of ADH and ALDH [ 2 22 23 24 25 22 23 25 25 26 19 24 2.2. Anti-Inflammatory Effects Outside of potentially modulating GI ethanol absorption and metabolic enzyme levels, ginseng is well-known for its robust anti-inflammatory effects [ 1 2 3 4 5 18 19 2 1 2 12 Luckily, ginsenosides have been found to inhibit several components of this inflammatory cascade. Rh1, Rh2, and compound K are known to suppress production of NO and PGE 2 1 1 27 The anti-inflammatory effects of these individual ginsenosides mirror KRG’s effects when given as an extract. A study with alcohol-treated mice found that co-administering KRG lowered levels of TNF-α and NF-κβ, while expressing higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein usually inhibited by TNF-α and NF-κβ that fosters neuronal growth and maturation [ 22 22 15 15 2.3. Modulation of Neurotransmitter Systems Following chronic alcohol exposure, the body downregulates the number or sensitivity of GABA receptors and increases the number or sensitivity of glutamate receptors in an effort to counter alcohol’s sedative effects [ 8 12 28 13 7 16 29 30 3 4 5 13 7 3 4 5 6 2.4. Additional Potential Mechanisms in Long-Term Alcohol Use Another study carried out with rats induced with AFLD demonstrated that coadministration of KRG resulted in partial reversal of the alcohol-induced suppression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and consequent upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in the liver [ 31 31 15 Additionally, some of the anti-inflammatory properties of ginsenosides are linked to their immunomodulatory effects [ 1 1 1 1 1 Panax ginseng Figure 1 3. Red Ginseng—Therapeutic Effects KRG has been cited to have a role in treating a wide range of ailments, including cardiovascular disease, central nervous system disorders, cancers, diabetes, inflammation, and addiction management [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 3 4 6 7 12 13 14 15 16 Table 1 2 3 4 12 3.1. Symptom Relief in Ethanol-Induced Hangovers—A Human Study A 2014 study [ 23 2 3 4 12 26 23 3.2. Effects on Alcohol Withdrawal in Animal Models Unfortunately, few subsequent projects on KRG’s impact on AUD have been carried out with human subjects. However, there have been a multitude of experiments with animal subjects that provide additional evidence for KRG’s utility in this area. A 2023 study compared the behaviors of ethanol-intoxicated mice with various levels of KRG extract pre-treatment [ 22 8 22 A 2014 study [ 29 4 5 6 13 29 These results are supported by a series of prior animal studies [ 29 30 31 30 32 28 23 29 33 3.3. Modulation of Addiction-Related Neurocircuitry It is worth noting that substance addictions are speculated to develop from alterations to neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in structures of the mesolimbic pathway of the brain, the same area of the brain affected in the previously mentioned 2014 study [ 3 4 5 13 7 4 5 6 Figure 2 3.4. Protective Effects Against Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease A frequent comorbidity of AUD is alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). KRG has been shown in many studies to have strong potential for use in counteracting some of the disorder’s most deleterious effects, including downregulation of inflammatory cascades, control of oxidative damage, and minimization of fat accumulation in the liver [ 15 31 Taken together, these findings suggest that KRG may offer several therapeutic benefits in the context of AUD, particularly in mitigating withdrawal symptoms, supporting cognitive function, and attenuating common comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and AFLD. However, while animal studies provide strong foundational evidence, the limited number of rigorous human trials underscores the need for further clinical validation before KRG can be recommended in AUD treatment protocols. 4. Red Ginseng—Side Effects KRG’s safety profile remains an area of ongoing debate due to conflicting clinical data stemming from a low number of trials and different preparation techniques of extracts throughout studies. The side effects reported throughout the literature span hepatic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, endocrine, and gynecological systems, though many findings are either of minimal clinical significance or in conflict with the results of similar studies. 4.1. Hepatic Concerns Herb-induced liver injury (HILI) is among the most significant risks associated with herbal and dietary supplements, particularly in individuals with pre-existing liver damage, including those with alcohol use disorder [ 4 55 56 57 Panax ginseng 57 4 55 56 Panax ginseng 34 34 35 34 4.2. Cardiovascular Effects Animal and clinical studies offer mixed insights into Panax ginseng 36 37 38 In humans, a study involving 30 healthy adults showed a statistically significant, albeit clinically minor, QTc prolongation and a modest drop in diastolic blood pressure after ginseng ingestion [ 34 39 4.3. Neuropsychiatric Effects Several case reports have linked ginseng use to acute manic episodes [ 34 40 34 40 34 4.4. Endocrine and Gynecologic Effects The structural similarity between ginsenosides and steroid hormones like estradiol has raised some concerns about ginseng’s potential endocrine-disrupting effects. A pair of case reports describe gynecomastia in a man who had ingested ginseng for a long period of time, and a 12-year-old boy who experienced gynecomastia after consuming ginseng for a month, with the gynecomastia resolving after discontinuing the boy’s ginseng prescription [ 34 41 42 34 34 34 Taking all these potential effects into consideration, KRG generally seems to be regarded as safe when used appropriately, but several reports of hepatic, cardiac, psychiatric, and endocrine effects, especially in high doses or vulnerable populations, warrant caution. The conflicting data across studies also highlights the importance of standardizing ginseng preparations and conducting more large-scale, controlled trials to clarify its risk profile. 4.5. Collective Side Effect Profile There appears to be a limited number of clinical trials designed specifically to evaluate the side effects of Panax ginseng Table 2 Panax ginseng 4 56 4 56 4 Panax ginseng 5. Red Ginseng—Drug Interactions Panax ginseng 35 43 44 58 59 5.1. Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome describes a severe drug reaction characterized by autonomic hyperactivity, neuromuscular abnormalities, and mental status changes as a result of a person taking multiple agents that raise serotonin levels [ 60 60 2A 61 45 Panax ginseng Meyer 46 Panax ginseng 60 60 2A 47 Panax ginseng 5.2. Warfarin and Antiplatelets Despite being widely researched, the nature of ginseng’s interaction with warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist used widely as an anticoagulant, remains inconclusive and controversial [ 43 Panax ginseng 48 48 43 43 However, not all studies have supported this interaction. A 2008 two-week randomized controlled clinical trial of 25 ischemic stroke patients receiving warfarin either with or without Panax ginseng 44 Panax ginseng Panax ginseng 43 44 3 Panax ginseng Panax notoginseng 59 Beyond its potential warfarin interactions, the same 2019 review suggested that ginseng exhibits potential interactions with aspirin, a widely used antiplatelet drug [ 59 49 50 Panax notoginseng 49 50 50 5.3.

Imatinib Panax ginseng 62 62 Panax ginseng 35 35 35 6. Discussion and Summary of Results from Human Experiments and Case Reports A significant limitation of the current research on KRG is the small scale and low quantity of the human experimental studies that have been carried out, with most recruiting fewer than 30 participants. For example, Kim et al. (2022) studied 13 Korean men and demonstrated that the bioavailability of certain ginsenosides (Rg3, Rk1 + Rg5, F2, compound K) was improved when ginseng was administered in bioconverted form, while Lee et al. (2014) enrolled 25 men and reported reduced plasma ethanol levels and attenuated hangover symptoms after ginseng ingestion despite elevated acetaldehyde levels [ 10 23 42 Other small trials have investigated drug–herb interactions. Yuan et al. (2004) worked with 20 healthy U.S. adults and found that American ginseng reduced the anticoagulative effect of warfarin, whereas Lee et al. (2008) (with 25 Korean stroke patients) reported no significant changes in warfarin’s activity, highlighting important inconsistencies in KRG’s interaction with the medication [ 43 44 52 53 Taken together, these experiments suggest that ginseng may influence drug metabolism and exert antioxidative effects, but conclusions are constrained by small sample sizes, short durations, and variable ginseng formulations. In the absence of animal data, these findings would provide only tentative, low-certainty evidence for human benefit, heavily limited by lack of replication and absence of Phase II/III trials. Clinical case reports and small series add further insight but underscore significant safety and heterogeneity concerns. Paik et al. (2015) and Norelli et al. (2015) document manic patients in individuals without prior history [ 34 40 54 34 34 39 35 48 Sample sizes in these case reports are uniformly small ( n 7. Conclusions As it stands, Panax ginseng 23 Due to its relatively lax regulations as a supplement, Panax ginseng Panax ginseng Panax ginseng Panax ginseng With all these gaps in mind, there is a pressing need for more research into the specific mechanisms, drug interactions, and appropriate dosing regimens of KRG and its ginsenoside components. To address some of these gaps, future research should prioritize larger, randomized, placebo-controlled human trials that move beyond acute hangover mitigation to a more holistic evaluation of KRG’s efficacy in treating individuals diagnosed with AUD. Discerning KRG’s potential to reduce alcohol cravings, mitigate a wider range of withdrawal symptoms, improve mood patterns, and prevent relapses over longer periods of time with longitudinal follow-up would provide a more complete picture of KRG’s potential efficacy as a supplement for individuals with AUD. Comparing these outcomes to more standard AUD pharmacotherapies would also be helpful in clarifying the extent of KRG’s therapeutic potential. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular changes, hormonal alterations, and mood irregularities in participants throughout these studies would be useful in better determining KRG’s side effect profile. Such research would benefit from the development of a more widely recognized, standardized KRG formulation with clearly defined ginsenoside profiles to improve reproducibility between studies. In addition, incorporating pharmacokinetic assessments in tandem with investigations of the clinical outcomes would help elucidate the role of individual variability (from differences in factors such as diet, gut microbiota composition, genetic expressions of metabolic enzymes, and medication regimens) in the overall therapeutic response. Finally, broader investigation into differential responses across sexes, age groups, genetic backgrounds, and common comorbidities, such as liver disease or depression, will be critical for clarifying KRG’s overall clinical utility in the AUD population. Beyond the limitations of the collective evidence base, another major limitation of this review is its conduction in a narrative format rather than as a systematic review or meta-analysis. Consequently, our process of identifying and selecting literature for the review was not standardized with predefined inclusion or exclusion criteria. While we attempted to include the most relevant and representative studies, there is potential that selection bias remains in our assembled study set, as certain publications might have been unintentionally overlooked due to issues with study accessibility or visibility within the databases we utilized. In addition, there is an inherent risk of interpretive bias in how the evidence was synthesized. Thus, the conclusions drawn from this work should be interpreted as a broad synthesis of existing knowledge rather than as a definitive, systematically derived evaluation.

[ 10 Human 13 Korean men Republic of Korea Key ginsenosides Rg3, Rk1 + Rg5, F2, and compound K all showed higher oral bioavailability when KRG was given in its bioconverted form with hydrophobic ginsenosides removed (e.g., Rb1) compared to its usual extract form. [ 23 Human 25 men Republic of Korea After consuming ethanol, men who consumed ginseng directly after had lower plasma ethanol concentrations in the initial hour and reported less subsequent hangover symptoms than the placebo group. Interestingly, ginseng group also had higher acetaldehyde levels despite this compound being associated with hangover symptoms, suggesting ginseng’s antioxidative effects may have masked the detrimental symptoms of higher acetaldehyde levels. [ 29 Animals—rats 4–6 rats for each part of experiment Republic of Korea and China Rats induced with ethanol withdrawal that received KRG expressed less anxious behavior than those that did not. A subsequent experiment showed this anxiolytic effect was blocked by a selective D2 receptor antagonist, but not a D1 receptor antagonist. [ 31 Animals—rats 40 rats Republic of Korea Rats receiving ethanol and KRG showed dose-dependent lower liver weight, hepatic triglycerides, total cholesterol, and plasma triglycerides compared to ethanol-only group. Additionally, they had less hepatic inflammatory cells, less fat droplets, no necrotic cells, and reversed AMPK suppression, all of which suggest a protective effect for AFLD. [ 18 Animals—various 4 rats, 5 mice Republic of Korea Rats and mice were found to have differences in the ginsenosides they absorbed from oral KRG extract, with mice showing Rg3 and compound K in the plasma (akin to humans), while rats did not. Additionally, the species metabolized certain ginsenosides (i.e., Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd) at different rates. Highlights the importance in species selection when extrapolating findings to human models. [ 13 Animals—rats 36 rats Republic of Korea Rats with induced morphine withdrawal that were given ginseng were found to have reduced anxious and depressed behavior using an elevated plus maze and forced swimming test. Changes in these rats’ CRF and neuropeptide Y expressions were identified in the hypothalamus when compared to controls. [ 21 Animals—rats 32 rats Republic of Korea, USA Absorption of ethanol in the GI tract was found to be 21.0% less in rats that received KRG compared to controls, with little difference found when administered intraperitoneally. Demonstrates KRG lowers ethanol’s oral bioavailability when given concurrently. [ 25 Animals—mice 20 mice Republic of Korea Serum ethanol and acetaldehyde levels of mice were reduced in groups that were administered non-ginsenoside compounds from steam-dried ginseng berries. Most abundant of these compounds included linoleate, palmitic acid, and linoleic acid. [ 26 Animals—mice Republic of Korea ALT and AST activity in mouse plasma, along with ethanol and acetaldehyde levels, were reduced in mice that received injections from ginseng sprouts prior to being given alcohol. This coincided with PCR determining higher expression of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase genes in the mice that received ginseng sprouts. Finally, the study showed the ginseng sprouts had a strong antioxidative effect in vitro. [ 28 Animals—mice 10–15 mice for each experiment Republic of Korea Elevated plus-maze model was used to examine anxiolytic effects of ginsenosides in mice. Found that those receiving ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, and a Rg5/Rk showed less anxious behavior than those without. Anxiolytic mechanism of the compounds was hypothesized to be due to their interaction with GABA A B [ 30 Animals—various 58–88 rats or mice for the 5 experiments conducted India Red and white ginseng were given orally to mice and rats, with their behaviors in open-field and elevated plus-maze tests. Neither showed effects on first dose, but when given twice over 5 days, anxiolytic effects were comparable to that of mice given diazepam. [ 32 Animals—chicks 80 + 64 five-day-old male chicks USA 64 five-day-old male chicks were injected with between 0.25 and 5.0 mg of ginsenoside Rb1. The chicks were found to have dose-dependent decreases in separation distress compared to the negative control chicks. [ 33 Animals—various 10 mice or rats for each experiment China An intestinal metabolite of ginseng, 20(s)-protopanaxadiol (S111), was found to have antidepressant effects in mice and rats comparable in potency to fluoxetine. This was consistent with dissection results that showed increased levels of monoamines in the brains of groups receiving S111 through anti-reuptake effects. [ 34 Human 4 case reports Republic of Korea Documents two cases of mania: a 56-year-old woman with previously diagnosed major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms on haloperidol and clomipramine, and the other a 26-year-old male with no psychiatric history, both of whom experienced a manic episode after starting to take ginseng capsules for 2 weeks and 2 months, respectively. Neither had any further instances of similar episodes with cessation of ginseng. 34 [ 35 Human 1 case report USA 26 y/o man taking imatinib for 7 years for chronic myelogenous leukemia presented with elevated ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin along with acute lobular hepatitis on liver biopsy 3 months after starting to drink energy drinks containing Panax ginseng [ 36 Animal 30 male rats China Extracts of white and red ginseng were injected into mice, with no significant EKG or obvious histological abnormalities being observed compared to controls. However, mice receiving ginseng did have comparatively high creatine kinases and decreased calcium ATPase activity, suggesting potential subclinical myocardial damage or calcium mishandling. [ 37 Animal 40 male rats Turkey Rats given KRG extract were found to have decreased blood pressure, elevated troponin I and myoglobin levels, and signs of diastolic dysfunction in comparison to negative controls. Histopathologic changes suggestive of potential myocardial injury and altered Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase gene expression were identified in these rats as well. [ 38 Animal 45 guinea pigs Republic of Korea Following an hour of normothermic ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion, guinea pigs previously fed for two weeks with KRG were found in comparison to negative controls to have improved aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output, and left ventricular systolic pressure. Animals also were found to have less dramatic EKG changes, suppressed lactate dehydrogenase and cardiac troponin I levels, and lower oxidative stress markers. [ 39 Human 1 case report USA 43 y/o woman consuming multiple caffeinated beverages along with 4 L of KRG beverages daily for at least six months presented with multiple instances of syncope, tonic clonic seizure, and prolonged QTc (up to 720 ms). No subsequent episodes occurred when the patient stopped consuming KRG. Suggests that prolonged use of KRG may pose cardiac risks when taken with other stimulants. [ 40 Human 2 case reports USA Documents two instances of patients experiencing manic episodes with no prior psychiatric history: one was a 23 y/o man who had been administered cannabis and unspecified “large quantities” of red ginseng every day for a month prior to his breakthrough manic episode; the other was a 79 y/o male who experienced a manic episode after he started consuming more than his baseline ginseng intake at around 3 to 4 “condensed drinks” per day. Symptoms of mania disappeared a few days after stopping ginseng intake. [ 41 Human 1 case report Turkey 39 y/o woman with history of smoking, coffee consumption, and frequent use of ginseng orally and topically developed menometrorrhagia and sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats. Symptoms were resolved within two weeks of stopping consumption of all these things. Authors speculate that ginseng could have contributed to abnormal uterine bleeding and tachycardia. [ 42 Human 22 women 21–30 y/o Republic of Korea KRG was found to reduce urinary levels of bisphenol A and malondialdehyde, an oxidative stress biomarker, in young women. Also improved constipation and menstrual pain/irregularity. [ 43 Human 20–9 men, 11 women USA Healthy adults part of a 4-week study received warfarin consecutively over 3 days at the start of week 1 and 4. Starting in week 2, half took American ginseng twice daily, and the others took a placebo. The group receiving ginseng exhibited significantly lower peak INR and plasma warfarin concentrations two weeks after starting ginseng, indicating that American ginseng reduced warfarin’s anticoagulant effect. While the authors suggested the ginsenosides may have increased warfarin’s metabolism or clearance through interactions with hepatic enzymes, no specific mechanism was explored or proposed. [ 44 Human 25–13 men, 12 women Republic of Korea 2-week study of 25 ischemic stroke patients receiving warfarin either with or without Panax ginseng Panax ginseng [ 45 Animals—various 10 mice/6 rats per experiment China Ginsenoside Rb1 was found to improve mobility and reverse depressive behavior in rodents subjected to chronic stress, with neurochemical assays finding associated increases in brain levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Suggests Rb1 may exert antidepressant effects through modulation of monoamine systems in the CNS. [ 46 Animals—rats 24 rats per experiment Republic of Korea In tail suspension and forced swim tests, white ginseng alleviated immobility and depressive behaviors in rats, with associated decreases in serum corticosterone levels and increased hippocampal serotonin concentrations noted. Serotonin concentrations were even higher than the rats receiving fluoxetine as a positive control. Suggests white ginseng may have antidepressant effects through modulation of stress responses and serotonin activity. [ 47 Animals—mice 4–6 mice per group, 5–9 groups per experiment Republic of Korea Mice induced with serotonin syndrome with 5-HT 2 [ 48 Human 1 case report USA 47 y/o man on a stable warfarin regimen had his INR dropped from 3.0–4.0 to 1.5 within two weeks of starting Panax ginseng [ 49 Animals—rats 12 rats China Co-administration of Panax notoginseng P. notoginseng [ 50 Animals—rats 12 rats China Co-administration of Panax notoginseng 49 [ 51 Animals—rats 6 rats Taiwan Selegiline’s bioavailability in rats was dropped from approximately 18% to 7.2% with low-dose ginseng but increased markedly to 29% with high-dose ginseng administration. The authors suspect these effects to be mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2, which metabolize selegiline into desmethyl-selegiline and L-methamphetamine. [ 52 Human 12–8 men, 4 women USA Participants were given single doses of midazolam and fexofenadine before and after 28 days of receiving oral KRG. KRG treatment was found to reduce midazolam exposure, indicating CYP3A enzyme induction, while fexofenadine pharmacokinetics were scarcely altered, indicating a lack of P-glycoprotein interaction. Recommended to check if patients are on any CYP3A substrates before permitting ginseng use. [ 53 Human 14 healthy men Republic of Korea 14 men had plasma samples collected after being given a variety of medications, including caffeine, losartan, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, fexofenadine, and midazolam both before and after being supplemented with KRG for two weeks. Weak inhibition of CYP3C9 and CYP3A4, and weak induction of CYP2D6 were identified through pharmacokinetic changes, but none were clinically significant. [ 54 Human 1 case report Canada 42 y/o woman who regularly consumed ginseng experienced symptoms of overstimulation (i.e., insomnia, tension headaches, visual hallucinations) after being started on phenelzine for depression. When phenelzine was reintroduced without ginseng, depression did not improve, but overstimulation was not experienced. Authors propose ginseng may have enhanced phenelzine’s psychoactive effects through inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase, though evidence of this mechanism is limited. diseases-13-00285-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Panax ginseng System Reported Side Effect Evidence Type Number of Cases (Patient Count) Hepatic Herbal-induced liver injury (HILI)-nonspecific to ginseng Literature review [ 4 55 56 China: Incidence of 6.38 per 100,000; Iceland: 3 per 100,000 [ 4 55 56 Cardiovascular Cardiac pathologies/myocardial damage (QT prolongation, tachycardia, ST depression, T wave inversion, AV block, troponin elevation, LDL elevation, diastolic dysfunction, HFpEF) Animal study (rats) [ 37 Dose dependent: Panax ginseng Panax ginseng QT prolongation Review [ 34 30 Arrhythmia Case study [ 39 41 34 3 [ 34 41 Elevated creatine kinase, increased cardiac contractility Animal study [ 36 Not specified TIA secondary to hypertensive crisis Review [ 34 1 Hypotension Review [ 34 ~13 GI Morning diarrhea Review [ 34 ~45 CNS/ Manic psychosis Case study [ 40 2 Manic episode Review [ 34 2 Nervousness Review [ 34 ~33 Sleeplessness Review [ 34 ~26 Depression Review [ 34 ~13 Reproductive/endocrine Menometrorrhagia Case study [ 41 1 Gynecomastia Review [ 34 2 ",
