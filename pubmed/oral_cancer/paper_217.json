The risk factors contributing to this trend have not been thoroughly studied, creating challenges in prevention strategies. Methods A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted to identify the association between sweet food consumption and breast cancer among women in Yemen. A total of 127 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer (cases) and 254 women who had never been diagnosed with any type of cancer (controls) were enrolled. The controls were matched to the cases based on age ± 2 years, place of residence (urban or rural), and menopausal status. Conditional logistic regression was used to accommodate the matching, and crude odds ratios (COR), adjusted odds ratio (AOR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. The level of significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results Women who consumed sweets three to seven times per week (AOR, 5.27; 95% CI 2.35–11.79) or one to two times per week (AOR, 2.98; 95% CI 1.39–6.37) were almost five and three times more likely to have breast cancer, respectively. Similarly, those who consumed pan-fried bread three to seven times per week (AOR, 2.17; 95% CI 1.02–4.61) or one to two times per week (AOR, 2.12; 95% CI 1.14–3.92) were nearly two times more likely to have breast cancer than those who consumed it rarely or never. Additionally, having a family member with a history of any kind of cancer increased the risk of developing breast cancer by more than twofold (AOR, 2.19; 95% CI 1.27–3.78). Conclusion Health education campaigns are urgently needed to raise awareness among the population about the risks associated with frequent consumption of sweets and pan-fried bread in relation to breast cancer development among women.

About 99% of breast cancer cases are found in women, while only 0.5–1% occur in men [ 1 1 2 3 4 7 8 Dietary habits are key determinants of human health, influencing the risk of various diseases and health conditions [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Increased consumption of milk [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 23 24 24 23 Breast cancer among women in Yemen is the most common type of cancer, accounting for 30.8% of the total cancer cases among women, with around 2,872 new cases recorded in 2022 [ 25 26 27 Methods Study design, setting, and population A matched case-control design was employed from June to August 2024. Female patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed breast cancer (diagnosed within the past six months) who were admitted to or visited the outpatient clinics of the oncology center in Sana’a city were recruited as cases. Females with breast cancer diagnosed more than six months prior to the interview, those with metastases, or those with a history of old cancer were excluded. The oncology center is the largest of its kind in Yemen and is well-equipped to handle various types of cancer, receiving patients from all governorates across the country. For each case, two female control were selected. These controls self-reported not being diagnosed with any type of cancer or having any tumors and were matched based on age (within ± 2 years), place of residence (urban or rural), the governorate from which the cases originated, and menopausal status. The controls were selected from relatives of non-cancer patients admitted to one of the following hospitals in Sana’a city: Al-Jamhory, Al-Kwait, and Al-Thwara. With a power of 80% and an alpha level of 0.05, assuming the proportion of smokers is 0.50 among the controls and the odds ratio is 2, along with a correlation of smoking between cases and controls of 0.2, the required sample size is 120 cases and 240 controls. Accounting for a 5% nonresponse rate, the final sample size is adjusted to 127 cases and 254 controls. All cases that met the inclusion criteria and were present during the data collectors’ visits were included in the study. Data collection began with the cases until the required sample size was reached, followed by data collection from the controls. The cases in this study were from various governorates in Yemen. Due to financial and security constraints, it was difficult to select controls from the same communities. Instead, controls were chosen from the relatives of non-cancer patients admitted to hospitals, ensuring they were from the same governorates and shared similar living conditions, whether rural or urban. Data collection Data regarding breast cancer diagnosis, including the date of diagnosis, histopathology results, tumor size, and grade, were collected from the patients’ files. Demographic information, dietary habits, and lifestyle data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. A medically trained team conducted the data collection. The study includes several independent variables that provide essential demographic and behavioural related information. Education level refers to the highest formal education attained, categorized as no education, primary education, or secondary and above. Marital status indicates the current marriage status of women, including married, ex-married, and single, while work status reflects whether women are employed or unemployed. Additionally, smoking status identifies tobacco use history, dividing participants into never smokers, current smokers, and former smokers. The number of children refers to the total number of children born to a woman, categorized into groups of 0–1, 2–3, 4–5, and 6 or more children, which ties into the family size variable that denotes the total number of individuals Living in a household, classified as 1–4, 5–6, 7–8, and 9 or more members. The variable received hormone replacement therapy refers to whether women have ever received this treatment, categorized as yes or no, and oral contraceptive usage is noted with responses of no or yes. The presence of a family member with cancer is recorded either yes or no. Physical activity was assessed using the international physical activity questionnaire-short form [ 28 29 The Diet History Questionnaire II from the Canadian National Cancer Institute, designed to assess intake over the past year, was adapted for Yemeni contexts before use [ 30 31 Data analysis Causal model analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the frequency of sweet consumption and breast cancer in women. Stata version 16 was used to analyze the data, employing conditional logistic regression to account for matching. Initially, the crude odds ratio was calculated to assess the association between the main outcome (breast cancer) and the main exposure (sweet food). Bivariate analysis was then conducted to examine the association between other exposure factors and breast cancer. Variables that showed significant associations with breast cancer in the bivariate analysis were subsequently evaluated in relation to the main exposure (sweet foods). Variables that were associated with both breast cancer and sweet foods in the bivariate analysis were identified as confounders and included in the final model. The adjusted odds ratio, along with the 95% confidence interval, was estimated, and a p-value from the Likelihood ratio test of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 127 cases and 254 controls were included in this analysis. The mean age of the cases was 43.7 ± 10.2 (SD) years, and the mean age of the controls was 43.3 ± 13.1 (SD) years. Approximately 45.0% of both cases and controls resided in rural areas, and one-third of both groups were post-menopausal. Unexpectedly, the percentage of women with a secondary level of education or above was higher among the cases (29.1%) than the controls (16.1%), and this difference was statistically significant (COR, 3.21; 95% CI 1.73–5.94). The majority of both cases and controls were married ( p p p p p p 1  Table 1 Respondents’s characteristics by cases and controls status Variables cases controls COR (95% CI) p  n %  n %  Age of respondents in year (Mean ± SD) 43.7 ± 10.2 43.3 ± 13.1  Place of residence Urban 70 55.1 140 55.1 Rural 57 44.9 114 44.9  Menopausal Status Pre-menopausal 86 67.7 172 67.7 Post-menopausal 41 32.3 82 32.3  Education level of respondents No education 61 48.1 168 66.2 Ref < 0.001 Primary 29 22.8 45 17.7 2.09 (1.16–3.76) Secondary and above 37 29.1 41 16.1 3.21 (1.73–5.94)  Marital status of respondents Married 94 74.0 187 73.6 Ref 0.604 EX-married 20 15.8 47 18.5 0.86 (0.49–1.52) Single 13 10.2 20 7.9 1.38 (0.60–3.18)  Work status Unemployed 120 94.5 233 91.7 Ref 0.321 Employed 7 5.5 21 8.3 0.65 (0.26–1.57)  Smoking status Never smoker 91 71.7 177 69.7 Ref 0.911 Current smoker 20 15.7 42 16.5 0.92 (0.51–1.67) Former smoker 16 12.6 35 13.8 0.87 (0.44–1.73)  Physical activities level Low 14 11.0 39 15.4 Ref 0.467 Moderate 42 33.1 76 29.9 1.55 (0.75–3.20) High 71 55.9 139 54.7 1.44 (0.73–2.85)  Number of children born to women 0–1 31 24.4 43 16.9 Ref 0.013 2–3 28 22.1 46 18.1 0.73 (0.37–1.45) 4–5 30 23.6 52 20.5 0.69 (0.33–1.45) 6 and more 38 29.9 113 44.5 0.35 (0.17–0.70)  Family size 1–4 28 22.1 34 13.3 Ref < 0.001 5–6 37 29.1 53 20.9 0.76 (0.38–1.52) 7–8 31 24.4 50 19.7 0.69 (0.35–1.38) 9 and more 31 24.4 117 46.1 0.26 (0.13–0.54)  Received Hormone therapy Yes 6 4.7 6 2.4 Ref 0.212 No 121 95.3 248 97.6 0.46 (0.14–1.55)  Ever Used Oral Contraceptives No 85 66.9 187 73.6 Ref 0.156 Yes 42 33.1 67 26.4 1.43 (0.87–2.32)  Family history with cancer No 81 63.8 205 80.7 Ref 0.001 Yes 46 36.2 49 19.3 2.35 (1.45–3.81) n % COR CI SD Ref Women who consumed sweet foods (three to seven times per week, COR: 6.09, 95% CI 2.91–12.76), or (one to two times per week, COR: 3.72; 95% CI: 1.82–7.63), pan-fried bread (three to seven times per week, COR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.50–5.98) or (one to two times per week, COR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.46–4.46) pan-fried chicken (one to two times per week, COR: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.58–5.57), pan-fried fish (one to three times per month, COR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.06–4.55), eggs (three to seven times per week, COR: 2.61; 95% CI: 1.29–5.25), dairy products (three to seven times per week, COR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.12–3.26), bread made from white flour (more than one time per day, COR: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.39–5.27), and soft drinks (one to two times per week, COR: 2.84; 95% CI: 1.50–5.37) were at higher risk of breast cancer compared to those who consumed these foods rarely or never.

Lastly, the consumption of meat, fish (oven-broiled, or grilled/barbecued), vegetables, pulses, whole grains, animal fats, and coffee at any frequency was not associated with breast cancer (Table 2  Table 2 Distribution of cases and controls by frequency food intake Food intake cases controls COR (95% CI) p  n %  n %  Sweets < 0.001 Rare or never 18 14.2 81 31.9 Ref 3 to7 times per week 36 28.3 27 10.6 6.09 (2.91–12.76) 1 to 2 times per week 33 26.0 43 16.9 3.72 (1.82–7.63) 1to3 times per month 40 31.5 103 40.6 1.67 (0.88–3.17)  Bread (pan-fried) Rare or never 38 29.9 126 49.6 Ref 0.001 3 to7 times per week 24 18.9 28 11.0 2.99 (1.50–5.98) 1 to 2 times per week 42 33.1 55 21.7 2.56 (1.46–4.46) 1 to 3 times per month 23 18.1 45 17.7 1.73 (0.90–3.30)  Chicken (pan-fried) Rare or never 100 78.7 233 91.7 Ref 0.001 1 to 3 times per month 27 21.3 21 8.3 2.97 (1.58–5.57) Chicken 3 to 7 times per week 43 33.9 56 22.1 Ref 0.044 1 to 2 times per week 57 44.9 124 48.8 0.62 (0.37–1.02) 1 to 3 times per month 27 21.2 74 29.1 0.50 (0.28–0.89)  Fish (pan-fried) Rare or never 45 35.4 78 30.7 Ref < 0.001 3 to7 times per week 25 19.7 20 7.9 2.19 (1.06–4.55) 1 to 2 times per week 31 24.4 45 17.7 1.25 (0.68–2.31) 1 to 3 times per month 26 20.5 111 43.7 0.37 (0.20–0.66) Fish Rare or never 96 75.6 187 73.6 Ref 0.664 1 to 3 times per month 31 24.4 67 26.4 0.89 (0.53–1.49)  Meat 3 to 7 times per week 23 18.1 34 13.4 Ref 0.205 1 to 2 times per week 28 22.1 45 17.7 0.92 (0.45–1.88) 1 to 3 times per month 76 59.8 175 68.9 0.64 (0.35–1.16)  Vegetable Rare or never 35 27.6 91 35.8 Ref 0.194 3 to7 times per week 30 23.6 39 15.4 1.95 (1.06–3.58) 1 to 2 times per week 32 25.2 63 24.8 1.28 (0.72–2.26) 1 to 3 times per month 30 23.6 61 24.0 1.25 (0.71–2.19)  Fruit 1 to 2 times per week 23 18.1 26 10.2 Ref 0.033 1 to 3 times per month 39 30.7 69 27.2 0.60 (0.30–1.20) During seasons 65 51.2 159 62.6 0.42 (0.21–0.82)  Eggs Rare or never 29 22.8 80 31.5 Ref 0.012 3 to7 times per week 25 19.7 25 9.8 2.61 (1.29–5.25) 1 to 2 times per week 41 32.3 64 25.2 1.68 (0.94–2.99) 1 to 3 times per month 32 25.2 85 33.5 1.01 (0.55–1.86)  Milk and dairy products Rare or never 41 32.3 108 42.5 Ref 0.044 3 to7 times per week 44 34.6 59 23.2 1.92 (1.12–3.26) 1 to 2 times per week 14 11.0 38 15.0 1.03 (0.51–2.06) 1 to 3 times per month 28 22.1 49 19.3 1.52 (0.83–2.74)  Pulses and nuts Rare or never 44 34.7 103 40.6 Ref 0.351 3 to7 times per week 30 23.6 44 17.3 1.54 (0.87–2.76) 1 to 2 times per week 22 17.3 35 13.8 1.39 (0.76–2.56) 1 to 3 times per month 31 24.4 72 28.3 1.02 (0.59–1.75)  Bread made from white flour Rare or never 23 18.1 60 23.6 Ref 0.004 More than once a day 45 35.4 49 19.3 2.71 (1.39–5.27) 3 to7 times per week 30 23.6 60 23.6 1.31 (0.66–2.60) 1 to 2 times per week 18 14.2 47 18.5 0.91 (0.44–1.85) 1 to 3 times per month 11 8.7 38 15.0 0.73 (0.31–1.66)  Whole grains Rare or never 91 71.6 174 68.5 Ref 0.287 3 to7 times per week 9 7.1 31 12.2 0.54 (0.23–1.22) 1 to 2 times per week 15 11.8 21 8.3 1.37 (0.66–2.83) 1 to 3 times per month 12 9.5 28 11.0 0.82 (0.39–1.72)  Animal oil Rare or never 79 62.2 177 69.7 Ref 0.365 1 to 2 times per week 33 26.0 51 20.1 1.40 (0.85–2.27) 1 to 3 times per month 15 11.8 26 10.2 1.28 (0.64–2.55)  Coffee Rare or never 39 30.7 67 26.4 Ref 0.743 3 to7 times per week 56 44.1 111 43.7 0.87 (0.51–1.48) 1 to 2 times per week 12 9.6 27 10.6 0.77 (0.35–1.68) 1 to 3 times per month 20 15.7 49 19.3 0.70 (0.37–1.35)  Red tea More than once a day 74 58.3 114 44.9 Ref 0.036 3 to7 times per week 37 29.1 102 40.1 0.53 (0.32–0.88) 1 to 2 times per week 16 12.6 38 15.0 0.61 (0.32–1.18)  Soft drinks Rare or never 72 56.7 178 70.1 Ref 0.005 1 to 2 times per week 25 19.7 21 8.3 2.84 (1.50–5.37) 1 to 3 times per month 30 23.6 55 21.6 1.41 (0.81–2.45) n % COR CI Ref In multivariable analysis (Table 3  Table 3 Multivariable analysis of the association between frequency sweet consumption and breast cancer among women Variables COR (95% CI) P AOR (95% CI) P  Sweet consumption Rare or never Ref < 0.001 Ref < 0.001 3 to7 times per week 6.09 (2.91–12.76) 5.27 (2.35–11.79) 1 to 2 times per week 3.72 (1.82–7.63) 2.98 (1.39–6.37) 1to3 times per month 1.67 (0.88–3.17) 1.42 (0.72–2.82)  Bread (pan-fried) consumption Rare or never Ref 0.001 Ref 0.049 3 to7 times per week 2.99 (1.50–5.98) 2.17 (1.02–4.61) 1 to 2 times per week 2.56 (1.46–4.46) 2.12 (1.14–3.92) 1 to 3 times per month 1.73 (0.90–3.30) 1.72 (0.86–3.45)  Red tea consumption More than once a day Ref 0.036 Ref 0.732 3 to7 times per week 0.53 (0.32–0.88) 0.80 (0.46–1.40) 1 to 2 times per week 0.61 (0.32–1.18) 0.88 (0.43–1.81)  Family history of cancer No Ref 0.001 Ref 0.004 Yes 2.35 (1.45–3.81) 2.19 (1.27–3.78) COR CI AOR Ref Discussion Our findings revealed that frequently consumption of sweet food is a strong predicators of breast cancer in Yemen. The misconceptions among Yemeni women about the importance of certain sweets, along with the enjoyable flavors of these treats, may lead to increased consumption. This trend could contribute to a higher incidence of breast cancer in Yemen, which is already the most prevalent type of cancer in the country. Frequent consumption of sweets, particularly those high in refined sugars and unhealthy fats, may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer through several interconnected mechanisms. One of the primary concerns is the contribution of high sugar intake to obesity [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 Our findings contribute to the existing literature by generating the hypothesis of an association between frequent consumption of sweets and breast cancer in women. This research highlights the potential health risks associated with high sugar intake, particularly within the context of traditional dietary practices. By examining the relationship between sweet consumption and breast cancer development, the importance of raising awareness among women about the nutritional implications of their dietary choices is emphasized. This finding can inform public health initiatives aimed at promoting healthier eating habits and reducing cancer risk within the population. Similarly, our study did identify a significant association between pan-fried bread and breast cancer development. Pan-fried bread, also locally known as khameer, is commonly consumed by Yemenis for breakfast. Pan-fried bread is often made from refined flours and can be high in simple carbohydrates and unhealthy fats, which may lead to increased insulin resistance and inflammation, both of which are implicated in breast cancer development. In Yemen, pan-fried bread is typically prepared in small cafes or by street vendors, and it is sometimes made at home. It is usually consumed hot, and the practice of repeatedly heating oils is common. Repeatedly heated cooking oils can produce a variety of compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which have been identified as carcinogenic [ 15 38 39 40 Our findings align with other research [ 41 43 44 45 In bivariate analysis, women who drank red tea three to seven times a week were less likely to have breast cancer compared to those who consumed it more than once a day. However, this relationship disappeared in multivariable analysis, which may be due to the strong impact of sweet food intake on breast cancer risk. This finding is similar to those from China [ 46 47 48 As a case-control study design, recall bias may occur in this study, as cases were often more likely to remember details about their exposures compared to controls. Additionally, the retrospectively self-reported data on food consumption may lead some cases and controls to inaccurately estimate their dietary frequencies. Furthermore, the study did not employ a complete dietary assessment method, which means that information on the quantities of food consumed was lacking, hindering the ability to estimate energy intake and potentially confounding the relationship between risk factors and breast cancer. Despite the fact that most sweets and other food types are traditional items that have been part of the local diet in Yemen for decades, and that dietary habits often reflect long-term patterns, there is a possibility that breast cancer may have developed many years before the interviews, as it is a slow-growing disease. Additionally, some participants may have altered their dietary habits prior to the specific timeframes asked about in the study. Consequently, potential bias may occur. To address this potential bias, further cohort studies are recommended. Some reproductive factors, such as the age at first birth, the duration of hormone replacement therapy, and family history of breast cancer, were not addressed in this study. Further research that includes these factors is needed. There is also a possibility that some controls might already have undiagnosed cancer. However, given the relatively low incidence of breast cancer in the population, the number of undiagnosed cases among the controls would be minimal and unlikely to significantly influence the results. Conclusion Frequent consumption of sweets and pan-fried bread, at rates of three to seven times per week or one to two times per week, is strongly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among women in Yemen. Policymakers, respected donors, and non-governmental organizations should raise community awareness about the risks associated with the frequent consumption of these foods. This could be achieved through a national health education campaign utilizing various media channels, schools, and initiatives focused on nutritional and hygiene awareness. Further cohort or experimental studies that use a comprehensive assessment of dietary intake are important to establish a causal relationship between sweet food consumption and breast cancer in women.
