Introduction Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is the preferred general term for a wide group of diseases, known as interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), which primarily affect the pulmonary interstitium and can lead to the fibrotic remodeling of the lung tissue [ 1 1 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 2. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 97 consecutive patients diagnosed with IPF and PPF, and treated with nintedanib, were enrolled. Patients were enrolled at the Pneumology Department of the University Hospital of Trieste and the Pneumology and Respiratory Pathophysiology Department of the Hospital of Udine. The retrospective data collection was conducted during the months of October, November, and December, subsequent to obtaining approval from the ethics committee and in strict adherence to the timelines outlined in the retrospective study approval protocol. The diagnosis of IPF and PPF was performed in accordance with the current guidelines, based on clinical evaluation, lung function tests, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans, and multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) encompassing pulmonologists, radiologists, pathologists, rheumatologists, and cardiologists with experience in the field of ILDs [ 9 2.1. Radiological Assessment All patients recruited into this study underwent chest HRCT at baseline and at follow-up with a frequency variable between 6 months and 12 months from diagnosis. The chest HRCTs were, where possible, all performed in the same reference center, to avoid confounding factors linked to the different machinery in use and to allow evaluation by radiologists with expertise in the study of interstitial diseases. Each chest HRCT was reviewed in the context of MDD and, whenever diagnosis was made solely based on imaging, the pattern that received the greatest consensus from MDD was considered as definitive. Independently from which group they belonged to, patients were divided according to the radiological pattern into two subgroups: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern and non-UIP pattern. 2.2. Respiratory Functional Assessment Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including FVC and DLCO assessments, were recorded at baseline (when treatment with nintedanib was established) and throughout the follow-up 6 and 12 months after therapy. When available, we also reported PFTs performed 12 and 6 months before therapy. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, functional tests conducted at these appropriate intervals were not always available. Therefore, we also considered as valid PFTs performed ±2 months from the established time. Lung function assessments were predominantly carried out using the same spirometer at the same recruitment center, to minimize variability related to equipment and operators’ differences. To evaluate the impact of nintedanib on lung function, we calculated for every patient the slope between FVC and DLCO at baseline and FVC and DLCO at 12 months after treatment, and we compared the average decline in the two indices. We excluded patients who discontinued therapy before 12 months, and we included patients that at that time were still alive. 2.3. Assessment of Comorbidities We screened all patients for comorbidities known to be associated with ILDs, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), history of exposure to pneumotoxic agents, and lung cancer. Moreover, to evaluate the impact of comorbidities on survival, we calculated for every patient the CCI score; it encompasses history of myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, peptic ulcer disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, moderate to severe chronic kidney disease, and either solid or hematologic tumors. 2.4. Stage Assessment The stage of pulmonary fibrosis was assessed through the ILD-GAP score and ILD-GAPC score, in order to evaluate the role of comorbidities on patients’ survival and to assess the precision of these scores in predicting mortality. 2.5. Statistical Analysis Data were recorded in an electronic database. Statistical analysis was performed by using IBM SPSS Statistics 30.0. Continuous variables were assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. The parametric t-test was used to compare continuous variables and identify differences between the two groups. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan–Meier curves, and differences between groups were evaluated through the log-rank test. The rate of decline in FVC and DLCO was estimated by interpolating serial pulmonary function tests collected during the follow-up. FVC and DLCO declines were expressed as % of predicted values rather than milliliters to avoid the reduced sensitivity associated with the linear interpolation in cases where absolute decline in milliliters was often unavailable. The relationship between variables was assessed through multiple linear regression, and variability within the regression model was investigated by analysis of variance (ANOVA). A p 3. Results A total of 97 patients affected with fibrosing ILDs (64 diagnosed with IPF and 33 diagnosed with PPF) and treated with nintedanib were retrospectively recruited; of them, 62 were followed by the Pneumology Department of the University Hospital of Trieste and 35 by the Pneumology and Respiratory Pathophysiology Department of the Hospital of Udine. Demographics, comorbidities, PFT, and chest HRCT pattern were investigated at baseline ( Table 1 3.1. Population Within the IPF patients, 75% ( n p Nine patients were primarily affected by CTD-ILDs, six had iNSIP, five had fHP, five had IPAF, two had post-COVID-19 ILDs, two iatrogenic ILDs, and the remaining four were affected by other forms of pulmonary fibrosis (one fibrotic OP, one fibrotic sarcoidosis, one PAP, and one UC-ILD). The most represented category was that of CTD-ILDs (29%), among which there were four SSc-ILDs, three RA-ILDs, one Sjögren-related ILD, and one Ant synthetase syndrome. 3.2. Radiological Pattern All patients underwent chest HRCT scans and were discussed in the MDD to define the radiological pattern. No semiquantitative analysis of lung involvement was performed. Among them, 89% ( n 3.2.1. Histological Pattern In line with major guidelines, none of the patients with a definite UIP pattern on chest HRCT underwent lung biopsy. Among patients with a probable UIP pattern, lung biopsy was performed only in two of them, confirming a histological UIP pattern. Three individuals with indeterminate for UIP pattern at HRCT underwent lung biopsy, which confirmed the presence of a histological pattern compatible with UIP. Only two patients with PPF did not undergo lung biopsy due to the unfavorable risk/benefit ratio. In one of them the histological finding of NSIP pattern confirmed the primary diagnosis, while the others were non-specific fibrotic forms. 3.2.2. BAL Cellularity Nine patients underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to detect cell differential counts and to rule out possible infectious agents before treatment was established. BAL cellular counts showed the following: macrophagic alveolitis in five of them, a neutrophil predominance in two of them, and lymphocytosis in one case in which diagnosis of IPF was still confirmed by cryobiopsy; in the remaining case BAL was not decisive due to poor cellularity in the sample. Within the eight PPF patients that underwent BAL, the most recurrent pattern was lymphocytosis (defined by the presence of at least 20% lymphocytes), which was detected in 75% of patients, followed by macrophage alveolitis, which was found in three patients. 3.2.3. Comorbidities Among 64 patients, 50 (77%) were current or previous smokers. Exposure to known pneumotoxic agents, such as asbestos and wood dust, was identified in 11 patients (17%). Other common comorbidities included gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) in 17 patients (27%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 8 individuals (12.5%), and pulmonary hypertension and lung cancer were found in 7 (11%) and 6 (9.5%) patients, respectively. In the PPF group a prevalence of current or previous smokers (37.25%) and patients suffering from GERD (42.4%) or pulmonary hypertension (15.1%) was found. Less frequent were exposure to pneumotoxic agents (15.1%), COPD (12.1%), and lung cancer (6%). 3.2.4. Stage Assessment According to the ILD gender/age/physiology score (GAP score), 40.6% of patients were at stage I, 48.4% at stage II, and 10.9% at stage III, while its form adjusted for comorbidities, named the ILD gender/age/physiology/comorbidities score (GAPC score), showed a prevalence of patients at stages II (50%) and III (42.2%) and only 5/64 patients at stage I. Regarding PPF, 93% of patients were at stages I and II according to the ILD-GAP score. However, most of them (79%) were found to be at stages II and III if screening with ILD-GAPC score corrected for the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score (CCIS). According to the second scoring system, only 7 out of 33 patients were at stage I ( Table 2 Table 3 3.3. Treatment with Nintedanib in the Two Populations 3.3.1. Subgroup Analysis: IPF Among the IPF group, treatment with nintedanib was established in 73% ( n n Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 2 Figure 3 3.3.2. Subgroup Analysis: PPF Among the PPF group, nintedanib was introduced according to the guidelines when progression was demonstrated in at least two of the three (clinical, physiological, and radiological) domains within the past year, without alternative explanation [ 9 Even in this case, almost all patients (31 of 33) received a full dosage of nintedanib of 300 mg per day, while only 2 patients received an initial daily dose of 200 mg. One third of patients with PPF ( n Figure 1 Figure 3 3.4. Survival Assessment We recorded 33 deaths during the follow-up, 24 (72.7%) of which were from the IPF group and 9 (27%) of which were from the PPF group. The remaining 65% of overall patients were still alive at the end of observation. In total, 14/33 dead patients had discontinued nintedanib before death occurred, and among all the patients who discontinued the drug, only 23.8% (5/21) were still alive at the end of observation. Among the patients who discontinued treatment, death occurred in 57% of patients from the IPF group (8/14) and 85.7% of patients from the PPF group (6/7). Survival rates were 89% at 12 months, 91% at 24 months, and 89% at 36 months among the overall population. In the IPF group, survival rates were 92.80%, 92.80%, and 86.7% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, while in the PPF group survival rates were 95.90%, 97.90%, and 99%, respectively, during the same observation period. Among patients with ongoing nintedanib therapy, the percentage of the number of events was 25%, while in the group of patients who discontinued the drug death occurred in 58.8% of cases. In the overall population, the estimated mean survival of patients with ongoing nintedanib was 70.22 months, while patients who suspended the drug had a mean survival of 44.47 months, with a statistically relevant difference between the two subgroups ( p Table 4 Figure 4 Stratifying patients into the two populations of study (IPF and PPF), only in the PPF group was there a statistically significant difference between patients with ongoing therapy and patients who discontinued nintedanib ( p Table 5 Figure 5 p Table 5 Figure 5 3.5. Impact of Nintedanib on Lung Function Among the overall population treated with nintedanib, there was an increase in FVC % at 12 months of treatment of +0.51 ± 18.4%. Among patients who discontinued therapy before 12 months, the mean annual decline in FVC was −4.41 ± 9.4%, which was faster but not significantly different from the mean annual decline in patients with ongoing therapy at 12 months ( p p Table 6 The annual decline in DLCO among the overall population treated with nintedanib was −6.33 ± 15.7%, slightly more marked among the PPF group (−7.87 ± 15.5%) compared to the IPF group (−5.62 ± 15.8%), although no statistically significant difference was demonstrated between the two populations ( p p Table 7 3.6. Potential Predictors of Mortality in ILDs In our study, we screened patients for the previously mentioned negative prognostic factors (advanced age at diagnosis, male sex, UIP pattern on HRCT, longitudinal decline in FVC % after 12 months of treatment with nintedanib) and for the most common comorbidities associated with ILDs, and we lastly derived ILD-GAP and ILD-GAPC scores for each patient [ Table 3 This study showed that ILD-GAPC score was more predictive than ILD-GAP score and that the presence of multiple negative parameters at the same time, including advanced age at diagnosis, male sex, UIP pattern on HRCT, and longitudinal decline in FVC (%) after 12 months of treatment, in addition to nintedanib suspension, could cumulatively influence early mortality ( p In the IPF population, stage III PF for the ILD-GAPC score was the greatest predictor of mortality ( p p Table 8 4. Discussion Our study provides valuable real-world insights into survival, disease progression, and response to antifibrotic therapy with nintedanib in both IPF and PPF patients. When contextualized with the existing literature, several findings emerge that both align with and extend current knowledge. Firstly, the average age at ILD diagnosis in our cohort was 70.74 ± 10.7 years, notably older than the mean age reported in prior studies, which typically ranges from 65 to 70 years [ 16 17 18 Gender distribution in our cohort—male predominance in IPF and female prevalence in CTD-ILDs—corroborates established epidemiological patterns documented in prior studies [ 6 19 20 The high prevalence of comorbidities such as GERD, COPD, lung cancer, and pulmonary hypertension mirrors previous large cohort studies [ 8 21 22 Regarding antifibrotic therapy, our findings align with current guidelines, which recommend nintedanib for IPF and, more recently, for PPF with progressive features. In our real-world setting, nintedanib was generally well tolerated and was discontinued by 20 patients (20.6%), similar to reported rates in the INPULSIS trials [ 8 17 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 Our analysis showed that the patients who maintained therapy exhibited a mortality rate of 25% versus 58.8% among those who discontinued it. This is in line with the findings from the CZECH EMPIRE registry where IPF patients treated with nintedanib had longer survival compared to those without treatment [ 24 55 56 57 58 In the PPF subgroup, the survival difference between patients continuing versus discontinuing nintedanib was particularly pronounced (71.11 vs. 27.44 months, p 25 26 27 Our multivariate analysis identified nintedanib suspension and stage III ILD (per ILD-GAP score) as strong predictors of mortality across all ILD patients. This aligns with prior studies emphasizing the prognostic value of ILD-GAP indices [ 28 29 Lung function trajectories showed modest improvements or stabilization with nintedanib, consistent with the INPULSIS trials and world data from a Dutch registry on IPF and PPF where FVC decline was attenuated but not reversed [ 8 30 27 5. Conclusions This real-world study provides meaningful insights into the clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of patients with IPF and PPF receiving antifibrotic treatment with nintedanib. Our findings support and extend the existing evidence, showing nintedanib is generally well tolerated and may contribute to improved survival in patients with both IPF and PPF. These results suggest that the benefits of nintedanib may extend beyond spirometry stabilization due to its broader antifibrotic effects on multiple disease pathways. The finding that nintedanib discontinuation and advanced ILD-GAP stage are key predictors of mortality highlights the importance of sustained treatment and timely disease staging. Although age, FVC decline, and UIP pattern are prognostic factors with a well-established role, particularly in IPF, there remains a clear need for more sensitive and specific biomarkers to guide clinical decision-making, especially within the heterogeneous field of PPF. However, given the observational nature of this study and the lack of significant differences in lung function trajectories, these results should be interpreted with caution, as reverse causation and indication bias may have influenced outcomes. Despite certain limitations, including relatively small sample size, absence of histopathological confirmation, and variability in treatment duration, this study enhances the complexity of fibrotic ILDs and multifactorial mechanisms driving disease progression. Moving forward, larger prospective studies integrating molecular and imaging biomarkers are essential to improve patients’ stratification and guide personalized treatment approach across the ILD spectrum. Future prospective studies with larger cohorts and comprehensive histological data are needed to better delineate predictors of response and optimize individualized treatment strategies.

ILD-GAPC score is a novel model that combines the ILD-GAP model with the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score (CCIS), a summed score of 19 comorbidities weighted according to severity, which could also be a prognostic indicator in patients with ILDs [ 35 36   ILD-GAP ILD-GAPC Model Score ILD diagnosis IPF/UC-ILD 1 0 0 CVD-IP 2 3 4 −2 −2 Gender Female 0 0 Male 1 1 Age ≤60 0 0 61–65 1 1 >65 2 2 % FVC 5 >75 0 0 50–75 1 1 <50 2 2 %DLCO 6 >55 0 0 36–55 1 1 ≥35 2 2 Cannot perform 3 3 CCIS 7 0–1  0 2–3 1 ≥4 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 jcm-14-06665-t003_Table 3 Table 3 ILD-GAP and ILD-GAPC models applied to our patients.
