The severity of these wounds is frequently exacerbated by persistent inflammation and the formation of bacterial biofilms, which significantly hinder skin regeneration. In this study, a pharmaceutical hydrogel-based wound dressing was developed and evaluated, incorporating silver nanoparticles synthesized with cinnamon essential oil that serves as both a stabilizer and antimicrobial agent, polymeric beta-carotene nanoparticles, and Centella asiatica Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Centella asiatica Centella asiatica alginate-hydrogel silver-cinnamon nanoparticles beta-carotene polymeric nanoparticles centella asiatica antimicrobial regenerative This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Chronic wounds can significantly impact patient lifestyle, and they may result not only from traumatic injuries but also as a consequence of underlying chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, or venous insufficiency, conditions that are increasingly prevalent in the general population. Unlike acute wounds, which typically heal within 8 to 12 weeks, chronic wounds are clinically defined by their failure to progress through the normal stages of healing, often remaining unhealed beyond three months. At the wound site, a persistent state of inflammation develops due to abnormal cellular and molecular interactions, largely exacerbated by infection and prolonged tissue damage. This pathological environment is marked by a complex interplay of biological factors, including elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 5 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Advanced wound dressings have emerged as a critical component of modern wound care, designed to meet the stringent requirements of chronic wound environments. Ideal dressings must not only serve as a physical barrier against external contaminants, given the compromised integrity of the skin, but also maintain a moist wound environment, absorb excess exudate, allow gas exchange through porosity, and provide anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Moreover, antimicrobial properties are essential, alongside ensuring biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-allergenicity [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 Recent clinical and preclinical studies have emphasized that these multifunctional features directly contribute to improved healing outcomes in chronic wounds when compared with conventional dressings such as gauze [ 23 24 25 26 27 Therefore, the human body possesses an intrinsic ability to initiate complex healing processes in response to injury. However, in certain pathological conditions, such as chronic wounds, this capacity becomes severely impaired. Chronicity can overwhelm the body’s natural regenerative mechanisms, particularly when infections, necrotic tissue, and persistent inflammation are involved. In such cases, external intervention is essential to stimulate and support tissue regeneration and restore the physiological balance. Modern advancements in biomedical engineering have enabled the refinement of traditional healing materials through the integration of nanotechnology and targeted synthesis strategies. These developments involve the use of common yet biologically compatible compounds, re-engineered to exhibit enhanced physicochemical properties that elicit favorable biological responses [ 28 29 30 31 Various strategies have been explored for chronic wound treatment. For instance, topical antimicrobials are effective in reducing low-grade contamination but may not suffice in controlling established infections, and their prolonged use beyond two weeks is generally discouraged. Iodine, widely used in clinical settings, shows notable antimicrobial activity but may pose allergenic risks. Hypochlorous acid and chlorhexidine also offer broad-spectrum antibacterial efficacy. A key requirement in the selection of antimicrobial agents is that they must selectively target bacterial cells without compromising the viability of host skin cells. Recently, silver nanoparticle-based dressings have gained increasing clinical attention due to their potent and broad-spectrum activity against biofilm-forming pathogens, representing a promising advancement in chronic wound therapy [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa 40 41 42 43 This study employs silver nanoparticles (Ag), widely recognized for their antimicrobial efficacy against prokaryotic and biocompatible relationship with eukaryotic cells [ 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 Centella asiatica 60 61 62 63 64 Figure 1 2. Results and Discussion The results are presented in the order corresponding to the sequential development of each material. Accordingly, the first part of this section includes the physicochemical characterization data of the Ag nanoparticles and the BC@PVP polymeric nanoparticles. 2.1. Silver (Ag) and Polymeric Beta-Carotene (BC@PVP) Nanoparticles Characterization X-ray diffraction analysis was employed to investigate the crystalline structure and lattice parameters of the synthesized silver nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 2 The resulting powder was further analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the morphology and size of the silver nanoparticles. Figure 3 Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was employed to assess the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of the Ag nanoparticles, providing insight into their physicochemical behavior in suspension. The results are illustrated in Figure 4 The physicochemical characteristics of the silver nanoparticles have been investigated, and the next step involves the characterization of the BC@PVP polymeric nanoparticles, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic agents prior to their incorporation into the hydrogel formulations. Accordingly, Figure 5 The FTIR analysis highlights the presence of functional groups specific to each component used in the synthesis of BC@PVP polymeric nanoparticles. Figure 5 −1 2 3 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 2 −1 Table 1 BC@PVP nanoparticles were further analyzed to investigate their morphology, elemental composition, and particle size using scanning electron microscopy. As shown in Figure 6 The BC@PVP polymeric nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light scattering to evaluate their hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential. Figure 7 In summary, Ag nanoparticles were successfully synthesized, with silver identified as the only crystalline phase in the XRD diffractogram. Their spherical morphology and nanoscale physical dimensions were confirmed by SEM micrographs. Although DLS analysis indicated a strong tendency toward particle aggregation, the AgNPs maintained high stability even in their agglomerated state. Similarly, the BC@PVP polymeric nanoparticles exhibited characteristic functional groups as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, along with spherical morphology and clear identification of individual particles in SEM images. Their physical dimensions remained within the nanometric scale, while the hydrodynamic diameter was significantly higher due to particle aggregation, which is consistent with the moderate colloidal stability observed in suspension. In the next stage, the synthesized Ag nanoparticles and BC@PVP polymeric nanoparticles were incorporated into alginate-based wound dressing formulations, where they serve as therapeutic agents to support the healing process of chronic wounds. Section 2.2 2.2. Alginate-Based Wound Dressings Characterization The successful integration of therapeutic agents into the polymeric matrix was confirmed through FTIR spectroscopy analysis of the developed wound dressings. The resulting spectra, presented in Figure 8 Due to the predominance of alginate in the developed formulations, the main functional groups identified across all wound dressings are associated with the alginate matrix. The hydrophilic character of the samples is evidenced by the broad absorption band around 3200 cm −1 −1 −1 − −1 −1 2 Centella asiatica −1 Centella asiatica −1 Centella asiatica Figure 9 The control sample (ALG), consisting only of the alginate matrix, exhibits a highly porous structure with uneven pore distribution and partial collapse of the internal architecture, likely due to disordered polymeric layering. In contrast, the ALG_Ag sample shows a more cohesive porous network with better-defined and interconnected pores. This structural improvement is attributed to the incorporation of Ag nanoparticles, which appear uniformly distributed throughout the matrix and contribute to pore stability, as revealed in backscattered SEM micrographs. The addition of BC@PVP nanoparticles in the ALG_BC formulation also led to significant morphological changes. While numerous pores are visible, the supporting polymeric structure appears more fragile and less interconnected compared to ALG_Ag, indicating that the polymeric nanoparticles influence the network without reinforcing it to the same degree. The ALG_Ag_BC sample exhibits a hybrid morphology, combining features of both ALG_Ag and ALG_BC. The pore network is visibly more stable than in ALG_BC, reflecting the structural reinforcement provided by Ag nanoparticles, while maintaining the general architecture observed in BC-loaded samples. The silver nanoparticles remain well-distributed, contributing to overall matrix integrity. The final formulation, ALG_Ag_BC_C, includes Centella asiatica The elemental composition of each dressing was examined using the SEM-EDS module, and the results are presented in Figure 10 Figure 11 Centella asiatica The time-dependent swelling capacity of all five wound dressing formulations was evaluated and is illustrated in Figure 12 The lowest swelling rate over the 24-h period was observed for the ALG_Ag sample, which can be attributed to its larger pore network and the partial pore blockage caused by the presence of silver nanoparticles. The ALG_Ag_BC dressing shows a swelling profile comparable to that of ALG_Ag_BC_C, indicating that the addition of the botanical extract does not significantly affect this property of the dressings. Overall, all formulations exhibit swelling ratios exceeding 100%, confirming their ability to effectively absorb wound exudate. The degradation behavior of the hydrogels was evaluated over a 24-h period, with the results shown in Figure 11 Chronic wounds are often associated with severe infections that significantly delay the natural healing process. Modern wound dressing development increasingly focuses on incorporating antimicrobial properties through the addition of active agents. In this study, Ag nanoparticles were included as antimicrobial components, prepared by a green method. Based on this strategy, the alginate-based formulations, ALG, ALG_Ag, ALG_BC, ALG_Ag_BC, and ALG_Ag_BC, were evaluated for their antimicrobial performance against Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Figure 13 Figure 14 The inhibition zone diameter (IZD) test results support the theoretical antimicrobial potential of each material used in the wound dressing formulations. Compared to the control sample (ALG), which lacks inherent antimicrobial properties, a clear enhancement was observed upon the addition of silver nanoparticles. Specifically, the ALG_Ag dressing showed IZDs of 12 mm against S. aureus E. coli S. aureus Centella asiatica The effect of the developed wound dressings on biofilm modulation was assessed by quantifying the number of viable bacteria (expressed as CFU/mL in log in base 10 scale) after 24 h of incubation with S. aureus E. coli 14 S. aureus S. aureus E. coli Centella asiatica 72 73 74 Centella asiatica 75 76 Centella asiatica Assessing the biocompatibility of the developed wound dressing materials in essential to ensure their safety and suitability for potential biomedical applications. To this end, HaCaT keratinocytes were cultured in contact with the alginate-based wound dressings for 24 and 72 h, after which cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay ( Figure 15 After 24 h of culture, HaCaT cells cultured on all dressing formulations exhibited cell viability levels comparable to those cultured on the pristine alginate control (ALG). However, a slight decrease in viability was observed for the ALG_Ag group compared to ALG, although this reduction was not statistically significant, suggesting only a mild cytotoxic effect from silver ions at early exposure. Interestingly, the ALG_Ag_BC_C group showed a statistically significant increase in cell viability compared to ALG_Ag, indicating that the incorporation of beta-carotene and Centella asiatica After 72 h of culture, all experimental groups revealed a statistically significant increase in cell viability compared to their cell viability profile determined after 24 h, indicating that all formulations support human keratinocytes proliferation over time. Moreover, the cell viability of HaCaT cells after 72 h of culture for all samples was similar to the cell viability of human keratinocytes cultured on pristine ALG dressing, except for Alg_Ag. The ALG_Ag group presented a statistically significant decrease in viability, highlighting a persistent cytotoxic effect likely attributable to prolonged silver exposure. Importantly, the ALG_Ag_BC_C formulation exhibited the highest cell viability after 72 h of culture, suggesting a synergistic effect between the beta-carotene and Centella asiatica To complement the MTT assay and further characterize the cytotoxic potential of the wound dressing formulations, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage in the culture medium was measured after 24 and 72 h of HaCaT cell culture in contact with the developed alginate-based wound dressings ( Figure 16 Centella asiatica After 72 h, LDH levels increased in all groups as compared with the results obtained after 24 h, as expected due to extended culture time. At this time point, the ALG_Ag group maintained the highest LDH release among all samples, further confirming persistent cytotoxic effects. Moreover, ALG_BC and ALG_Ag_BC showed similar LDH levels to the experimental control dressing ALG, while ALG_Ag_BC_C showed significantly lower LDH release than ALG_Ag, similar to the control ALG group, suggesting effective cytoprotection over prolonged exposure. The obtained results align with the MTT assay results, demonstrating that while silver triggers a mild cytotoxic stress for human keratinocytes, its effects can be mitigated by the inclusion of antioxidant and bioactive agents such as beta-carotene and Centella asiatica, To further investigate the potential oxidative stress induced by the wound dressing formulations, intracellular ROS levels were quantified after 24 and 72 h of HaCaT contact with the alginate-based wound dressings ( Figure 17 Centella asiatica 2.3. Discussion The experimental results presented in this study highlight the successful development and comprehensive characterization of multifunctional alginate-based wound dressings incorporating green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag) and beta-carotene-loaded polymeric nanocarriers (BC@PVP). Each component was carefully selected for its biocompatibility and therapeutic potential, aiming to address the multifaceted pathology of chronic wounds. The findings confirm not only the efficient integration of these therapeutic agents into the alginate matrix but also their individual and combined contributions to the structural integrity, porosity, antimicrobial performance, biocompatibility, and cell-supportive properties of the final materials. Chronic wounds pose a major clinical challenge due to impaired healing and a high risk of infection. In this context, the development of advanced biomaterials that integrate antimicrobial, antioxidant, and regenerative properties is of critical importance. The strategy applied in this study by combining silver nanoparticles, beta-carotene, and Centella asiatica The synthesis of Ag nanoparticles in this study was a key process, considering the multiple factors that can influence their physicochemical properties depending on the substances involved. The reducing agent used was D-glucose, a common sugar compound naturally produced by plants through photosynthesis. In order to promote nucleation and the formation of a large number of nanoparticles, NaOH provided the necessary alkalinity for the reduction solution. It is also known that the use of D-glucose in Ag nanoparticle synthesis typically leads to the formation of smaller nanoparticles and, implicitly, a higher tendency for aggregation [ 77 + 0 78 79 The results obtained from the physicochemical characterization of the Ag nanoparticles confirm the distinct contributions of each reagent used in the synthesis. Crystallinity of the silver nanoparticles was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, where sharp and well-defined peaks corresponding to metallic silver (Ag 0 80 81 Beta-carotene is a cyclic carotenoid compound characterized by 11 conjugated double bonds, exhibiting high hydrophobicity and pronounced chemical instability [ 82 A similar method for the preparation of beta-carotene solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) was explored by Ashay Jain et al. [ 83 84 85 86 The successful formation of BC@PVP polymeric nanoparticles was further confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of characteristic functional groups associated with both beta-carotene and PVP components [ 65 66 67 68 69 70 Following the successful synthesis and characterization of both Ag nanoparticles and BC@PVP polymeric carriers, the next focus of this study was the integration of these bioactive agents into alginate-based wound dressings and the evaluation of their structural, antimicrobial, and regenerative performance. The spectral modifications observed across all dressing formulations offer strong evidence of the successful incorporation of therapeutic agents and the natural extract into the ALG_Ag_BC_C matrix, thereby supporting the enhanced antimicrobial and regenerative properties of the final dressing [ 87 88 89 The advanced field of wound dressing design and development continuously strives to address the complex requirements of an ideal wound dressing. In this study, the same principles were followed, aligning the material design with the specific challenges posed by chronic wounds. In this context, the polymeric matrix represents the bulk of the dressing, while the therapeutic agents are incorporated in smaller quantities relative to the total material. The selection of alginate as the structural matrix offers several advantages, including excellent biocompatibility, intrinsic porosity, and the ability to incorporate and release therapeutic agents directly at the wound site. SEM micrographs of the five developed formulations confirm the porous nature of the hydrogels, as well as the successful incorporation of the therapeutic agents, which influences the overall morphology of the wound dressings. Ag nanoparticles likely act as rigid inorganic fillers that hinder the formation of ice crystals and allow the pores to form into a continuous structure. In contrast, the incorporation of BC@PVP contributes to increased viscosity and softening of the alginate network, which results in a weaker structural framework around the pores and a more fragile morphology. The dual incorporation of both therapeutic agents appears to balance these opposing effects, leading to a more compact porous matrix. Notably, the addition of Centella asiatica The antimicrobial performance of the five alginate-based hydrogel formulations was assessed by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zone and quantifying the residual biofilm formation after 24 h of incubation with S. aureus E. coli The antimicrobial performance observed in the developed dressings is consistent with the theoretical contributions of the incorporated therapeutic agents. The sample containing only Ag nanoparticles (ALG_Ag) exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect, as expected, given that Ag nanoparticles together with cinnamon oil are well known for their potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity [ 90 91 92 Centella asiatica Centella asiatica 93 94 95 The biological assessment of novel wound dressings is critical to determine their cytocompatibility with skin-relevant cells, such as keratinocytes, prior to advanced studies and in vivo testing. The biological evaluation of the alginate-based wound dressing demonstrated that the presence of silver ions, while beneficial for antimicrobial purposes, exhibited a mild cytotoxic effect and induced oxidative stress in human keratinocytes. However, the incorporation of antioxidant and bioactive agents significantly ameliorated these adverse effects. The ALG_Ag_BC_C formulation, in particular, preserved cell viability, minimized LDH leakage, and maintained ROS levels comparable to or below the pristine alginate control. These findings emphasize the importance of a carefully balanced formulation when designing wound dressings, a formulation that leverages the antimicrobial efficacy of silver while incorporating protective agents to mitigate its cytotoxic effects. Several studies have similarly reported that silver nanoparticles or silver ions can be cytotoxic to human skin cells, highlighting the need for dose control and synergistic design strategies in the development process. In general, because Ag nanoparticles are often coated with organic or inorganic moieties to optimize their interactions with living cells while preserving antimicrobial activity [ 96 Centella asiatica Centella asiatica 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 3. Conclusions This study reports the development of multifunctional alginate-based wound dressings incorporating silver nanoparticles, beta-carotene nanocarriers, and Centella asiatica Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Centella asiatica 4. Materials and Methods The materials used for the development of antimicrobial and regenerative wound dressings in this study include silver nitrate (AgNO 3 Centella asiatica Centella asiatica 4.1. Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles (Ag) The chemical reduction of metallic salt, specifically silver nitrate, was utilized to synthesize Ag nanoparticles. Aqueous AgNO 3 4.2. Synthesis of Beta-Carotene-Loaded Polymeric Nanoparticles (BC@PVP) Beta-carotene-loaded polymeric nanoparticles were prepared using PVP as the encapsulating polymer and Tween 80 as a surfactant. Initially, 100 μL of Tween 80 was dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol under continuous magnetic stirring to ensure uniform dispersion. To this solution, 1000 mg of PVP and 100 mg of beta-carotene were added, and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 30 min to facilitate solubilization. The nanoparticle formation was induced by probe sonication, applied in pulsed mode (30 s on, 10 s off) for a total duration of 3 min. This process enabled the encapsulation of beta-carotene within the polymeric matrix and promoted the formation of nanosized, stable particles dispersed in the ethanolic medium. 4.3. Formulation of Alginate-Based Hydrogels (ALG, ALG_Ag, ALG_BC, ALG_Ag_BC, ALG_Ag_BC_C) For the preparation of the dressings, a 5% ( w v The first sample served as the control formulation, containing only the alginate matrix without any added therapeutic agents, and is referred to hereafter as ALG. The second formulation involved the addition of silver nanoparticles to the ALG matrix at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, and was designated as ALG_Ag. For the third formulation, BC@PVP nanoparticles were added to the alginate matrix to achieve a final concentration of 2 mg/mL, and this sample was labeled ALG_BC. The fourth sample, ALG_Ag_BC, was obtained by incorporating both therapeutic agents (Ag and BC@PVP) into the alginate matrix at the same concentrations used in the individual formulations. To further enhance the bioactivity of the dressings, particularly in line with the green synthesis principles applied throughout this study, a botanical extract of Centella asiatica v v Centella asiatica All samples were frozen for 24 h, followed by lyophilization process for 72 h to obtain the final porous hydrogel dressings. Figure 18 4.4. Investigation Methods The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) technique was used to investigate the phase and crystalline parameters of silver nanoparticles. A PANalytical Empyrean model was operated to perform the analysis purchased from PANalytical (Almelo, The Netherlands) featuring a hybrid monochromator (2xGe 220) on the incident side and a parallel plate collimator found on the PIXcel 3D detector on the diffracted side. Grazing Incidence XRD (GIXRD) mode was applied at ambient temperature, with a fixed incidence angle (ω) of 0.5°, and the 2θ scan range set between 10° and 80°. The system operated using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), at 45 kV and 40 mA. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to identify the functional groups present in the BC@PVP polymeric nanoparticles as well as in the developed wound dressing formulations. The analysis was carried out using a Thermo iN10-MX spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a ZnSe crystal. Spectra were recorded in absorbance mode, with a background spectrum collected prior to each sample measurement. The instrument was set to a resolution of 8 cm −1 −1 Morphological analysis, as well as particle and pore size evaluation, were carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The investigations were performed with an Inspect F50 SEM system (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA), equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) module for elemental characterization. Micrographs were acquired using both secondary electron and backscattered electron detectors, at an accelerating voltage of 30 keV. For Ag nanoparticles, a small amount of dry powder was evenly dispersed on a carbon adhesive tape mounted on an SEM stub. In the case of BC@PVP nanoparticles, 10 µL of the suspension was deposited onto the carbon tape and allowed to gradually air-dry at room temperature. The lyophilized wound dressings were cut into 5 mm discs and mounted directly onto the carbon tape before being introduced into the SEM analysis chamber. The physicochemical behavior of the nanoparticles in liquid suspension was assessed using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Measurements were performed with a DelsaMax Pro instrument (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), equipped with a 532 nm laser. Samples were dispersed in ultrapure water and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 10 min in a water bath prior to analysis, to ensure uniform dispersion and minimize aggregation. To assess the swelling capacity, lyophilized dressings were cut into cylindrical shapes with a diameter of 5 mm. Each sample was immersed in 5 mL of ultrapure water at room temperature. The time-dependent swelling ratio was calculated using the following formula: S w e l l i n g  r a t i o = W t − W i W i × 100 % W i W t The initial stage of dressings degradation was also investigated, as it represents a critical parameter for wound dressing performance. The degradation rate was determined based on the following equation: D e g r a d a t i o n  =  ( 1  −  W 0 − W t W 0 )  ×  100 % W 0 W t 4.5. Antimicrobial Evaluation 4.5.1. Bacterial Strains To evaluate the antibacterial performance of the developed wound dressings, two clinically relevant bacterial strains commonly associated with chronic wound infections were selected. The assay included one Gram-positive strain, Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli 4.5.2. Adapted Disc Diffusion Protocol The evaluation of antibacterial activity for alginate-based dressings was performed using a modified disc diffusion method, adapted to the physical and chemical nature of hydrogels, in accordance with CLSI recommendations (2021). The procedure began with the preparation of a standardized microbial inoculum, consisting of a suspension of bacterial cells in sterile physiological saline, derived from 18–24-h cultures. The cell density was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (approximately 1.5 × 10 8 4.5.3. Monospecific Biofilm Development The antibiofilm activity of the wound dressings was assessed using an in vitro monospecific biofilm model. This assay was designed to evaluate the ability of each formulation to inhibit or reduce bacterial biofilm formation. Circular samples (5 mm diameter) were sterilized by UV irradiation (20 min per side) and placed into sterile 24-well plates, each containing 1 mL of nutrient broth. Subsequently, 10 μL of bacterial suspension (adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard) from S. aureus E. coli 4.6. In Vitro Biological Evaluation 4.6.1. Cell Culture and Experimental Design To evaluate the biocompatibility of the developed wound dressings, the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was employed as in vitro model. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S, Sigma Aldrich), under standard culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO 2 Prior to cell seeding, the wound dressing samples were sterilized by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light for 20 min. HaCaT cells were seeded directly onto the sterilized dressings at a density of 1.5 × 10 4 2 4.6.2. Biocompatibility Assessment Cell metabolic activity was evaluated using the MTT assay as an indicator of cell viability post-contact with the novel wound dressings. After removing the culture medium, cells were incubated with 1 mg/mL MTT solution (3-(4,5-dimethilthiazol-2-il)-2,5-dipheniltetrazolium, Sigma Aldrich) freshly prepared in serum-free DMEM, for 4 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the resulting formazan crystals were solubilized with 2-propanol, and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a FlexStation 3 multimodal reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Cell viability was expressed as a percentage relative to the untreated control group at 24 h, which was set at 100%. To assess membrane integrity and cytotoxic potential, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the culture medium was measured. Cell culture medium samples were collected and analyzed using In vitro Toxicology TOX-7 assay kit (Sigma Aldrich), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After a 30 min incubation with the kit components, the reaction was stopped by the addition of HCl, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm using the Flex Station 3. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were quantified using the fluorescent probe DCFH-DA (2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, Sigma-Aldrich). For this purpose, bioconstructs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 10 μM DCFH-DA diluted in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Excess dye was removed by PBS washing, and fluorescence was measured immediately at excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/530 nm using a FlexStation 3 microplate reader. ROS levels were expressed relative to the untreated control according to the following formula: ROS Production (%) = (Fluorescence of treated cells/Fluorescence of control cells) × 100. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments.
