There is increasing access to curative therapies, such as hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), for people living with SCD. However, more information on pulmonary function in adults with SCD after HCT is needed to best guide decisions for HCT and post-HCT care. Objectives To test the hypothesis that forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 Methods People living with SCD undergoing nonmyeloablative HCT in a prospective cohort at the NIH Clinical Center from 2004 to 2019 were evaluated for enrollment. Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations and descriptive statistics were calculated before HCT and annually for 3 years. Six-minute-walk distance (6MWD) testing was performed. Generalized estimating equations were employed to evaluate interindividual changes in PFT parameters and 6MWD. Results Of 97 patients with SCD undergoing HCT, 41 (42%) were female with median (25th, 75th percentile) age 31.8 (24.8, 38.0) years. Each year of measurement included the following numbers of subjects available for analysis with PFTs: baseline ( n n n n n n n n 1 l CO l CO 1 Conclusions Overall, PFT results remained stable and there was an improvement in D l CO Keywords sickle cell disease pulmonary function nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant Division of Intramural Research 10.13039/100017540 1U01HL156620-01 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
