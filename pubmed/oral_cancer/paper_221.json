However, the regulatory status of these colorants differs across regions. Objective This study aims to systematically identify the color additives found in the list of ingredients of chewing gum products available on Indian online marketplaces and to compare the regulatory frameworks governing these food colorants in India, the European Union (EU), and the United States of America (USA). Methodology Chewing gum products were identified from Indian online marketplaces namely Amazon Fresh, BigBasket, and Flipkart using “chewing gum” as the specific search keyword. The data on color additives listed in the ingredients list of these products were systematically collected, categorized, and evaluated. A comparative regulatory assessment of the food colorants used in chewing gum was also conducted, examining differences in their permitted or prohibited status across India, the EU, and the USA. Results The study assessed CG products [ N Conclusion The study urges the Indian authorities to ban suspected harmful color additives and promote safer alternatives.

Throughout history, natural colorants have been extracted from vegetables, such as carrots and saffron, as well as from minerals like iron [ 10 11 Manufacturers highly depend on artificial food colorants as they enhance product appearance, increase color intensity, and are economically less costly compared to natural alternatives [ 12 However, growing concerns about certain synthetic colorants, such as tartrazine and Titanium Dioxide, have led to debates over their safety, with studies suggesting their association to allergic reactions, particularly in children [ 13 14 Along with these concerns, the small size of CG packaging often results in ingredients lists being printed in microscopic fonts, making it difficult for consumers to read and assess the presence of potentially harmful additives [ 15 Given the rising concerns about synthetic color additives in CG and their potential health implications, this study systematically examines the presence of these additives in CG products available on Indian online marketplaces. Additionally, it evaluates their regulatory status across the USA, the EU, and India to provide insight into global safety standards. Methodology The ingredients list of CG products available on Indian online marketplaces were collected in September 2024. The included data were from three online shopping marketplaces, namely Amazon Fresh, BigBasket, and Flipkart. The search was conducted using “chewing gum” as a specific keyword across the online marketplaces. Inclusion criteria The study includes:  All types of CG products in different forms and flavors. Products priced at INR 200 or below per item. Products with a complete ingredients list, either provided in the product’s in-app description or visible on the pack of the item. Products with minimum customer rating of 3 stars, ensuring consumer acceptance and market relevance, as higher-rated products (4–5 stars) have been proven to influence purchase likelihood and are perceived as more useful in consumer decision-making [ 16 17 Exclusion criteria The study excluded:  CG products classified as doctor-recommended or medicated, as their formulation, purpose, and regulatory standards differ from those of regular CG products. Duplicate products that were available in multiple pack sizes, and those with identical names and ingredients list, to avoid duplication bias. Any other CG products not meeting the specified inclusion criteria, maintaining dataset consistency. Data extraction  Fig. 1 Data extraction flowchart Figure 1 Data collection and standardization The list of ingredients of various CG products were recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Each list has been reviewed, and relevant data were extracted and entered into the MS spreadsheet. The recorded data included the color additives found in the list of ingredients, as well as the brands name and flavor of the CG product. The color additives extracted from the reviewed products have inconsistent naming, such as using International Numbering System (INS) code, E code or the chemical name of the color additive; therefore, the alternative names were also considered. Identification of the regulatory status of color additives in the list of ingredients in chewing gum products The regulatory status of color additives used in CG products sold on Indian online marketplaces was assessed based on information from three major regulatory authorities: the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In India, edible food colors are regulated under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the Food Products Standards and Food Additives Regulations, 2011, specifically Chap. 3.1.2. In addition, the relevant appendices were considered [ 18 19 20 allowed banned restricted limited use 18 20 Statistical analysis A descriptive analysis of the frequency and distribution of color additives in the included CG products was conducted. The MS Excel spreadsheet version 2021 was used to conduct all the analyses. Results Description of the included products The study included 51 CG products from 11 different brands. Among these, 18 were sugar-free, of which 13 were spice-/herbal-flavored and 5 were fruit-flavored. The remaining 33 products contained sugar, including 6 spice-/herbal-flavored and 27 fruit-flavored varieties.

Multiple color additives were identified in the studied CG products, and the majority of products 80.39% contained one colorant, whereas 7.84% contained 2 colorants, 5.88% contained 3 colorants, 3.99% contained 4 colorants and 1.96% contained 5 colorants. It is worth mentioning that having multiple color additives can synergistically contribute to a higher incidence of allergies and asthma [ 21 22 In the current study, 20% of CG products used between 2 and 5 colorants. However, as more colorants are added, the risk of adverse health effects also increases. Some CG products on the online marketplaces in India still contain colorant combinations in their list of ingredients. The number of colorants used in CG products is not the only risk factor, but the type of color additives used also plays a significant role. For instance, the present study revealed that Brilliant Blue FCF is the most widely used colorant, which is found in 15 CG products in the Indian online marketplaces. Although this colorant is permitted for use in the USA, it is restricted with limited use in CG products in the EU and India, as there are concerns about its potential neurodevelopmental effects in rats [ 22 23 24 25 Tartrazine was the second most commonly used colorant in CG products, appearing in 13 products. Although this colorant is permitted in the USA, it is restricted with limited use in CG products in the EU and India, but the EU requires products that contain Tartrazine to display a warning label. This regulation is based on studies suggesting a correlation between Tartrazine and hyperactivity in children, especially those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [ 26 13 27 Titanium Dioxide was present in 7 CG products. Recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of Titanium Dioxide as a food color additive. Similarly, a systematic review of 64 studies on rats exposed to Titanium Dioxide revealed that it can cause oxidative damage by increasing oxidative stress, particularly at higher doses and with long-term exposure [ 14 18 28 29 30 31 18 It was observed that Ponceau 4R was present in 5 products, and Erythrosine was also present in 5 products. The regulatory status of these two colorants varies by region. In the USA, both colorants are banned due to potential health concerns. Ponceau 4R, in particular, has raised concerns due to its potential health implications. Studies in mice have shown that Ponceau 4R impacted DNA migration and neurobehavioral aspects [ 32 32 Erythrosine has also been linked to potential side effects on rats, including serotonergic inhibition and corticosterone changes, which may impact brain function [ 33 34 35 18 19 Sunset Yellow FCF was present in 4 CG products, while Azorubine was present in 3 products. Both colorants are approved for use in India under certain restrictions, despite their link to ADHD. In the EU, while both colorants are permitted, products containing them must display warning labels due to potential health concerns. In the USA, Sunset Yellow FCF is approved for use, although evidence suggested harmful effects at higher doses, including significant histopathological liver damage observed in rats [ 36 37 Carotenes, Amaranth and Vegetable Carbon were each identified in 3 CG products. Carotenes colorant is approved in all three regions. On the other hand, Amaranth is banned in India and the USA to protect public health [ 18 20 19 38 39 40 18 41 19 Anthocyanins, Curcumin, Carmines and Allura Red AC were each identified in 1 CG product. Anthocyanins, and Curcumin are generally considered safe colorants within ADI limits and allowed by the three authorities. Carmines is banned in India and restricted with limited use in the EU, but it is still allowed in the USA [ 18 20 42 43 44 18 20 In addition to the previously mentioned findings, it should be noted that the maximum permitted levels of color additives in CG products significantly differ from one country to another. In India, most natural color additives are regulated under the term GMP, while synthetic color additives are generally limited to 100 mg/kg. Notably, Titanium Dioxide is permitted at a higher level of 10,000 mg/kg in CG products in India [ 18 18 In the EU and the USA, several colorants were banned or restricted, but they are still being used in CG products sold on Indian online marketplaces. In the USA, most permitted color additives follow GMP, but particular colorants are banned. Titanium Dioxide is permitted up to 12,500 mg/kg in CG products [ 20 19 19 A promising solution to address the health and environmental challenges and mitigate the health concerns associated with artificial food colorants is the adoption of natural alternatives derived from vegetable and fruit waste, such as peels and roots. For instance, grape skins, a by-product of wine production, are rich in Anthocyanins, producing deep purple and red pigments [ 45 46 47 48 Conclusion The study highlights significant concerns about the regulatory status of colorants present in CG products available on Indian online marketplaces. The USA and the EU have banned or restricted the use of many color additives found in the CG due to their potential to cause health-related issues, which emphasizes the need for a reconsideration of their safety in India. To address these concerns, the FSSAI could foster the development of healthier CG products by promoting the use of safer and nature-derived coloring additive alternatives that exist in vegetables, fruits, etc. It is critical to raise public awareness about the importance of reading the ingredients list of products and understanding the health-related impact of additives. Furthermore, implementing a comprehensive scoring system to assess the healthiness of CG products based on the number and type of food additives, as well as their toxicological profiles, could improve consumer information, encourage industry reformulation, and help consumers make informed decisions about the safety and healthiness of food products. Limitations of the study The studied data solely rely on the list of ingredients of CG products, but laboratory tests are necessary to determine the precise level of color additives usage. Additionally, it should be noted that the study does not consider the full nutritional profile or other additives present in CG products, such as sweeteners, making it challenging to identify the overall health impact based on all the ingredients. This research included only CG products with customer ratings between 3 and 5 stars. However, information on purchase quantity and frequency could not be considered, as the online marketplaces do not provide such datalimits accurate understanding of the actual exposure of the additives to the consumers. Furthermore, the analysis was limited to products within the defined price range and rating criteria, reflecting only the products available in the selected platforms under these specific conditions. The focus of the research was on the descriptive analysis of color additives in CG products, and it linked the findings with the regulatory status of these colorants to highlight their significance for regulatory compliance and consumer safety. However, due to the small sample size and the categorical nature of the data, inferential statistical analyses were not performed. Therefore, the findings should be interpreted in light of these limitations. Future studies with larger datasets would enable more detailed statistical analyses, and implementing laboratory tests may address these gaps.
