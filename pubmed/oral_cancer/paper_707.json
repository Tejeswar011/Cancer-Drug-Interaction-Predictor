Introduction Infection with Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Types I and II (HTLV-1/2) represents an underestimated public health issue, with a heterogeneous geographic distribution and a significant burden in endemic areas of Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Peru. HTLV-1 affects more than 10 million people worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 HTLV-1/2 is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, vertical transmission (particularly via breastfeeding), blood transfusions, and, in certain regions, through exposure to contaminated blood through unsterile practices, such as scarification rituals or poorly hygienic procedures. These transmission routes are shared with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [ 2 The presence of both HIV and HTLV-1 in an individual’s immune system promotes immune dysregulation, characterized by paradoxical expansion of dysfunctional CD4 + + 9 1 Strongyloides 10 11 In Brazil, the prevalence of HTLV/HIV co-existence is heterogeneous, ranging from 1.3% to 7%. HTLV-1a is the predominant subtype in the Amazon region, while a high endemicity of HTLV-2 has been observed among Indigenous populations and drug users. In Peru, although data are more limited, HTLV-1/2 infection has been documented in both urban and rural populations, with transmission hotspots in the Amazon region and evidence of circulation among Indigenous communities and individuals with similar risk factors to those reported in Brazil [ 5 6 7 10 12 13 14 The Peruvian Amazon is a key area for HIV transmission, with the second-highest cohort of patients in the country receiving antiretroviral treatment after Lima [ 15 16 17 2 3 4 5 The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of HTLV-1/2 infection in a pilot sample of PWH in the Peruvian Amazon, describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of superinfected individuals, and analyze differences compared to HIV-monoinfected patients. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Setting A cross-sectional study was conducted among PWH who were receiving care at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine of the Regional Hospital of Loreto “Felipe Santiago Arriola Iglesias” in Iquitos, Peru. The study period was from 20 October 2023 to 31 December 2023. 2.2. Study Population and Enrollment Criteria Adults aged 18 years and older with confirmed HIV infection who were receiving outpatient care at the Regional Hospital of Loreto were eligible for inclusion. After providing informed consent, participants completed a semi-structured oral interview that collected data on demographics, clinical history and potential epidemiological risk factors. After that, a blood sample was obtained. We planned to estimate the prevalence of HTLV coinfection among ~1000 PWH in care. Using an expected prevalence of 10% according to a previous meta-analysis in Peru [ 18 Separated serum samples were aliquoted and frozen at −20 °C. When 96 samples were obtained, an ELISA kit was used, never exceeding four weeks. The presence of antibodies against HTLV-1/2 was initially screened using a single ELISA assay (HTLV I+II ELISA recombinant v.4.0 96-well kit, Wiener Lab, Rosario, Argentina; catalog number 1671096). A result was considered positive when the optical density value exceeded the negative control by 0.200, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Due to the lack of local confirmatory testing, the 15 serum samples that were positive for HTLV at screening were sent to a HTLV reference laboratory in Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain. To facilitate safe transport from Iquitos without a cold chain, aliquots of frozen serum were applied to Whatman filter paper to create dried serum spots (DSS), which were air-dried, sealed with desiccant, and shipped using standard triple packaging. Upon arrival, DSS were eluted and tested with INNO-LIA HTLV I/II Score (Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan; catalog number 80540), following standard laboratory procedures. While serum/plasma are the manufacturer’s validated matrices, DSS were used exclusively for transport. Molecular assays, including HTLV typing and proviral load, could not be performed, as DNA extracted from cellular fractions (whole blood/PBMCs) was not collected. We performed serologic testing for Strongyloides stercoralis 19 20 Strongyloides S. stercoralis Those who were positive for HTLV 1/2 were contacted again to conduct a more comprehensive interview on risk factors for transmission, including the origin of their parents. 2.3. Statistical Data Analysis Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using the Newcombe method. Comparisons between categorical variables were performed using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test when any expected cell count was <5, while continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test, given the non-normal distribution. Age was analyzed as a continuous variable and, for specific comparisons, dichotomized at the 75th percentile (P75 = 49 years) into <50 vs. ≥50 years. Risk factors associated with HTLV positivity were explored using bivariate analysis, with odds ratios (ORs) used to quantify associations. Subsequently, we fitted a multivariable logistic regression model using a forward stepwise procedure to identify independent risk factors for HTLV positivity. Age and sex were included a priori, and additional covariates with p 2.4. Ethical Considerations The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Regional Hospital of Loreto in Iquitos, Peru (EXP: ID-018-CIEI-2023) and by the Ethics and Research Integrity Committee of Miguel Hernández University of Elche, Spain (DMC.JMRR.230908). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Confidentiality of data was strictly maintained, and results were only disclosed to each participant’s HIV care provider, who ensured appropriate follow-up and treatment. 3. Results 3.1. Overview of the Study Population A total of 293 PWH were included in the study, of whom 66.9% were male, with a median age of 40 years (IQR 30–49). Of the participants, 16.7% had no formal education or had only attended primary school, 21.8% had received a blood transfusion, 94.5% had been breastfed, and 89.9% acquired HIV through sexual transmission. This overview serves as a reference for subsequent subgroup comparisons between HTLV-positive and HTLV-negative participants, described in Table 1 3.2. HTLV Subtypes 15/293 patients tested positive for HTLV during screening. Of them, 14/293 (4.8%) were definitively confirmed: 1/293 was HTLV-1 (0.3% 95% CI 0.06–0.9), 11/293 were HTLV-2 (3.8%, 95% CI 2.1–6.8) and 2/293 (0.7%, 95% CI 0.1–2.7) were non-typeable by INNO-LIA HTLV I/II score ( Figure 1 3.3. Description of HTLV-HIV Co-Existence Of the 14 patients confirmed positive for HTLV, the median age was 55 years (IQR 52–61), and >85% were older than 50 years. All but one were Mestizos (92.9%), while one patient was of the Kukuma race, a tribe that lives on the Marañón River inside Pacaya Samiria National Reserve ( Figure 2 All but 1 (92.9%) had been breastfed; 3 (21.8%) had received a blood transfusion, and only 1 (7.1%) referred to scarification practices. Four (28.6%) patients had non-heterosexual sexual practices or more than five sexual partners. The characteristics of HIV-HTLV co-existence are presented in Table 2 3.4.

Discussion This study confirms the relevance of HTLV-HIV coexistence in patients from the Peruvian Amazon, where HTLV-2 predominates over HTLV-1, in contrast to other regions of South America and the world where HTLV-1 is by far more frequent. Two distinct epidemiological patterns of HTLV-2/HIV superinfection have been described: one in Europe, largely associated with people who inject drugs [ 21 2 8 9 11 12 13 14 22 23 In Peru, the Shipibo-Konibo ethnic group in the Amazonian region exhibits a high prevalence of HTLV-1 (5.7%) and HTLV-2 (3.8%) [ 24 25 8 26 6 6 25 26 8 23 27 The older age observed in patients with HTLV-HIV co-existence has been observed in previous studies [ 28 29 28 30 31 32 Although at least half of the patients’ relatives resided in rural communities along the tributaries and the main course of the Amazon River. The most frequent origin was rural settlements south of Iquitos along the Marañón and Ucayali Rivers, whereas communities along the Amazon River en route to Brazil were less common, which may support the existence of a persistent transmission niche in the Peruvian Amazon [ 2 5 25 The clinical course of HTLV-2/HIV co-existence is heterogeneous. Although HTLV-2 is associated with lower pathogenicity than HTLV-1, some studies suggest that it may modulate HIV progression, with reports of “long-term non-progressor” phenotypes and lower HIV proviral load in individuals with HTLV-2, possibly mediated by increased CD8 + 9 25 One of the main strengths of this study is its focus on epidemiological surveillance strategies for HTLV and HIV, particularly in a region where such data are scarce. By addressing this neglected area, the study contributes valuable information for public health decision-making and future research planning in the Amazon region. However, the study has several limitations. First, the small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings. Second, confirmatory testing was performed on eluates from dried serum spots applied to Whatman paper, a transport method not formally validated by the INNO-LIA manufacturer and which may slightly reduce sensitivity in low-titer samples. However, previous studies using dried-spot matrices for HTLV serology report high specificity and variable sensitivity (≈81–100%), supporting their feasibility in field settings. The results should therefore be interpreted cautiously and confirmed with serum or plasma when possible [ 33 In conclusion, our screening study in the Peruvian Amazon highlights a significant prevalence of HIV–HTLV co-existence, particularly with HTLV-2. Risk factors include age over 50 years. However, awareness and identification of HTLV co-existence remain important, as they can guide appropriate patient follow-up and care strategies. Future multicenter studies with larger cohorts and long-term follow-up are needed to better define the clinical relevance of both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in people living with HIV, especially in endemic areas such as the Amazon region. From a public-health perspective, the ~4% HIV–HTLV coinfection burden supports integrating HTLV testing into HIV clinic workflows, linking positive cases to counseling and Strongyloides Acknowledgments We want to thank the medical staff of the Infectious Diseases Service at Loreto Regional Hospital and Iquitos Hospital, together with the laboratory staff of LIPNAA-CIRNA and Asociación Civil Selva Amazónica, for their support in the field.
