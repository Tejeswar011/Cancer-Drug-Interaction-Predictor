Introduction Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has traditionally been defined as a clinical response to exposure to life-threatening events, with a symptom cluster encompassing intrusive re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and physiological hyperarousal. However, this definition has significantly evolved in recent decades. Current conceptual models have expanded to include not only catastrophic events but also the cumulative effects of chronic interpersonal adversity, socio-environmental stressors, and psychiatric vulnerability, leading to the emergence of broader trauma-spectrum conditions [ 1 2 Within this revised framework, we suggest that heroin use disorder (HUD) may itself serve as a traumatising process, independent of any specific traumatic event [ 3 This leads to the core hypothesis of the present paper: heroin addiction may induce a sustained process of psychological and physiological sensitisation to stress, similar to what is observed in opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Just as repeated withdrawal lowers the threshold for pain sensitivity, repeated episodes of withdrawal and the existential distress associated with heroin use may reduce the threshold for maladaptive stress responses, contributing to a PTSD-like condition without the need for an initial external trauma. We describe this condition as the Post-Heroin Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Spectrum (pH-PTSD/S), a clinical syndrome characterised by intrusive symptoms, affective dysregulation, and hyperarousal in individuals with HUD—even without a traditional trauma history. To support this framework, the following sections will address: The bidirectional relationship between PTSD and substance use, including epidemiological links, clinical symptom overlap, and theoretical models. From classical PTSD to Opioid-Trauma Syndromes, with an emphasis on neurobiological mechanisms of stress sensitisation. Clinical evidence of the post-heroin PTSD spectrum, derived from observational and psychometric data. The implications of this model for trauma-informed care, including a discussion on whether opioid agonist treatment (OAT) can reduce PTSD-spectrum symptoms in this population. Limitations and Strengths of pH-PTSD/S. By reconceptualising heroin dependence as both an addictive and traumagenic condition, this paper aims to promote a neurobiologically integrated and clinically actionable understanding of dual disorders involving HUD and trauma-spectrum psychopathology. 2. The Bidirectional Link Between PTSD and Substance Use 2.1. The Relationship Between PTSD and SUD 2.1.1. Epidemiological Links Between PTSD and SUD Epidemiological research consistently documents a notable co-occurrence between PTSD and SUD across clinical and community samples. Lifetime PTSD prevalence among treatment-seeking SUD patients is high—typically reported to range from 36% to 50%—a pattern that has been repeatedly observed across various clinical settings [ 4 5 6 7 5 8 It is noteworthy that the extent of comorbidity is not consistent; higher co-occurrence is observed among particular groups, notably military veterans [ 9 10 11 12 13 6 14 7 Notably, the presence of PTSD and SUD together results in a significant combined illness burden. Findings from various studies and systematic reviews have shown a moderate to high level of confidence in the negative impact of comorbidity on prognosis and service requirements. Specifically, patients with both conditions exhibit a higher prevalence of medical comorbidities, increased rates of suicide attempts, a greater incidence of legal issues, and considerably higher utilisation of healthcare services compared to those with a single diagnosis [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 2.1.2. Clinical Overlap and Symptom Interactions PTSD and SUD share multiple symptom domains and can worsen each other, making it hard to tell apart disorder-specific features from interactional ones. A key area involves physiological arousal and withdrawal symptoms. Core PTSD signs, such as sleep issues, hypervigilance, and irritability, tend to get worse during substance withdrawal, leading to clinical profiles that resemble or intensify PTSD hyperarousal. Existing evidence ranges from detailed clinical case reports to neurobiological reviews specific to the disorders. These sources suggest that withdrawal can both mimic and strengthen PTSD arousal symptoms [ 5 21 22 23 24 25 26 The clinical literature, when considered collectively, supports a reciprocal symptom-amplification model where PTSD and SUD interact dynamically. This model proposes that symptom domains in one disorder can be intensified by neurobiological and behavioural processes in the other, making diagnosis and management more complex. However, some findings indicate that PTSD is an independent risk factor for poorer outcomes in SUD [ 13 27 Overall, longitudinal syntheses and comprehensive reviews show a largely bidirectional relationship, where PTSD often comes before the development of SUD. At the same time, significant or extended substance use can, in turn, increase vulnerability to subsequent PTSD after new traumatic exposures [ 28 2.1.3. Etiological Frameworks Multiple, not mutually exclusive, etiological models have been proposed to explain the frequent co-occurrence of PTSD and SUD. Each model is supported to varying degrees by epidemiological, clinical, and mechanistic evidence. The Self-Medication Hypothesis (SMH) proposes that individuals might use substances to cope with PTSD symptoms. This theory suggests that traumatic stress causes negative emotional states, which people may attempt to manage by using drugs or alcohol. While this behaviour can offer temporary relief, it often leads to physical dependence and withdrawal, potentially exacerbating PTSD-like symptoms. The SMH, originally developed by Khantzian, suggests that individuals see drug use as the most effective way to relieve psychological distress and suffering. This view describes drug use as a “drive to use,” reflecting the motivations behind self-medication behaviours [ 29 30 Symptoms commonly associated with this condition include anxiety, hyperarousal, impulsivity linked to increased stress reactivity, and memory difficulties. Patients may also exhibit heightened emotional responses to trauma-related cues and intrusive re-experiencing of traumatic memories, especially within the context of conditioned fear responses [ 31 32 5 The SMH also encompasses the idea that substance choice is not random, but rather related to the specific type of distress experienced. For example, adolescents with dysregulated stress reactivity might try to modulate their arousal levels through substance use—either to reduce hyperarousal or to increase hypoarousal states [ 33 34 A substantial body of literature supports a directional pathway in which PTSD precedes substance use or dependence. Preclinical studies indicate that PTSD-related dysregulation of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and noradrenergic systems may gradually heighten stress responses. Patients may therefore self-medicate with sedatives, hypnotics, or alcohol to break this feedback loop or to alleviate distress linked to trauma reminders [ 35 While PTSD is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, SUD is among the most common and clinically significant. Comorbidity between PTSD and SUD complicates clinical outcomes for both conditions [ 17 18 36 In summary, the SMH is well supported by empirical evidence, particularly concerning alcohol use. Its significance has been extensively discussed in comprehensive reviews and research centred on opioids. However, the evidence relating to opioids remains moderate due to a lack of prospective, longitudinal studies [ 4 5 28 The Shared-Vulnerability Model offers an alternative explanation, highlighting complex, convergent vulnerability factors that heighten the risk of both PTSD and SUD. According to this perspective, shared biological, genetic, and environmental mechanisms may account for the concurrent development of the two disorders. Stress circuit dysregulation has been observed in both PTSD and SUD. Dysregulation of the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis contributes to altered stress responses, as documented in both clinical and preclinical studies [ 23 37 25 Neurobiological maladaptations in shared reward and fear regulation systems have also been associated with both disorders. Changes in mesolimbic dopamine, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and noradrenergic pathways have been observed. One key hypothesis proposes that upregulation of the dynorphin/κ-opioid receptor (DYN/KOR) system serves as a common mechanism underlying both negative affect and drug craving [ 24 38 In summary, the Shared-Vulnerability Model indicates that PTSD and SUD may arise from common vulnerability factors affecting core neurobiological systems. Genetic, neuroendocrine, and environmental influences influence brain function, shape behavioural traits, and collectively contribute to stress sensitivity and substance misuse. Elevated catecholamine levels, disrupted HPA-axis functioning, and widespread neurochemical as well as structural changes in brain regions responsible for executive control and decision-making might establish a shared neurobiological basis for both disorders [ 39 The Traumagenic Hypothesis presents an alternative explanation, suggesting that early-life trauma and adverse developmental conditions can lead to enduring neurobiological changes that increase vulnerability to both PTSD and SUD. According to this hypothesis, stress-related disruptions in neurotransmitter systems may influence not only trauma-related psychopathology but also a greater likelihood of substance experimentation, alcohol use, and eventual dependency [ 31 40 11 12 These findings support developmental models of bidirectional vulnerability, which propose that early stress exposure affects neural circuitry in ways that predispose individuals to both PTSD and substance-related disorders. This maladaptive neurodevelopmental pathway encourages behavioural disinhibition and risk-taking tendencies, heightening susceptibility throughout life. Furthermore, childhood adversity has consistently been associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviours, developing substance use disorders, experiencing additional trauma in adulthood, and ultimately meeting the diagnostic criteria for PTSD [ 31 40 Taken together, these observations highlight the vital role of developmental trauma in the co-occurrence and mutual reinforcement of PTSD and SUD. The interaction between early-life adversity, neurobiological changes, and behavioural vulnerability underlines the importance of trauma-informed approaches in prevention and treatment strategies for dual diagnoses. 2.2. The “Addiction-Induced PTSD Vulnerability” Model: SUD as an Independent Risk Factor in Increasing Individual Susceptibility to PTSD The Addiction-Induced PTSD Vulnerability Model further advances this discussion by proposing that substance use disorders (SUDs) may act as independent risk factors that heighten vulnerability to PTSD. While extensive research has examined how prolonged stress and trauma exposure contribute to the development [ 3 6 41 42 43 44 45 46 Physiologically, individuals with SUD often show increased baseline activity of brain stress systems, as evidenced by higher adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and hair cortisol levels compared to healthy controls [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 3 54 55 56 Notably, individuals with SUDs have a higher likelihood of developing PTSD after trauma exposure compared to non-users, due to greater trauma exposure and increased stress reactivity. This was demonstrated in a study of individuals with cocaine use disorder, where trauma sustained during drug procurement resulted in subsequent PTSD [ 57 58 On a neurobiological level, dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis has been consistently observed across various substances, including alcohol, opioids, cocaine, nicotine, and cannabinoids [ 44 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 Animal and human studies have shown that both stress and addictive substances activate overlapping neural circuits, including the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway and the extended amygdala, reinforcing their bidirectional interaction [ 69 70 71 72 73 Overall, dysregulation of the brain’s stress systems is not just a consequence but a key driver of addiction-related processes. This framework supports the hypothesis that SUD may occur before and enhance the development of PTSD by causing persistent neurobiological changes—particularly within the CRF and noradrenergic systems—that reduce resilience to future trauma [ 5 28 3. From Classical PTSD to Opioid-Trauma Syndromes 3.1. Rethinking PTSD: From Diagnostic Criteria to Trauma Spectrum In recent years, the traditional view of PTSD as a separate diagnostic entity has been increasingly challenged by a more nuanced, dimensional perspective. While classical PTSD remains tied to specific diagnostic criteria and the experience of life-threatening events, clinical research has highlighted a broader PTSD spectrum that includes symptom constellations arising from chronic adversity, sustained social stress, or cumulative trauma exposures [ 2 74 Critically, this reconceptualisation has important implications for clinical assessment and intervention. Many individuals experiencing debilitating trauma-related symptoms do not meet the strict criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, yet they exhibit clear signs of emotional, cognitive, and physiological dysregulation. Such cases are particularly common among populations exposed to ongoing low-level threats or structurally embedded stressors. Chronic substance dependence, social marginalisation, and exposure to community violence have all been recognised as environmental factors capable of producing traumatised phenotypes through mechanisms similar to those found in classical trauma models. The impact of prolonged social marginalisation has been confirmed by cross-national longitudinal data. Young adults facing unstable housing, judicial involvement, unemployment, or minority status show higher rates of psychological distress and substance use, along with distinctive patterns of emotional dysregulation and relational dysfunction. These outcomes align with trauma-spectrum presentations and appear to arise not from isolated incidents, but from ongoing exposure to exclusion and structural vulnerability [ 75 Further evidence from the field of health disparities supports this view. Structural racism, discrimination, and exclusion serve as chronic stressors with significant psychobiological effects. Research has shown that racial discrimination can dysregulate the HPA axis through anxiety-related pathways [ 76 77 78 79 Similarly, exposure to community violence—particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged environments—has become a major factor in trauma-related symptoms. Both direct victimisation and witnessing violence are associated with PTSD-like symptoms, which may be subclinical but can still affect daily functioning. Neuroimaging studies confirm that these experiences alter brain connectivity within key emotional and regulatory networks [ 80 81 82 Importantly, these traumagenic contexts are not merely external to addiction; they are arguably fundamental to the heroin-using experience. Individuals with HUD often reside in environments shaped by social exclusion, community violence, and interpersonal instability. Heroin dependence, in this context, develops not only as a response to past trauma but also functions as a chronic traumatising condition in its own right. The lifestyle linked to heroin use—characterised by cycles of withdrawal, criminalisation, precarious survival, and emotional desensitisation—exposes individuals to repeated stressors that can trigger and sustain trauma-spectrum symptoms. From this perspective, heroin addiction should be regarded not simply as a comorbid condition of PTSD but as a source of trauma sensitisation—one capable of producing a PTSD/S phenotype. 3.2. Opioid-Induced Stress Dysregulation and Neurobiological Trauma On a neurobiological level, a complex interaction exists between the endogenous opioid system, its dysregulation in cases of HUD, and the brain’s stress systems. This interaction may explain the observed link between HUD and a heightened risk of subsequent PTSD. To clarify, the hypothesis that HUD increases vulnerability to PTSD through disruptions in the endogenous stress regulatory systems has been proposed [ 28 30 The regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis by the endogenous opioid system happens through three main mechanisms, each helping to modulate stress responses [ 83 84 85 86 86 Therefore, using opioid antagonists to block the endogenous opioid system has been shown to cause disinhibition of opioid regulation of the HPA axis. This results in increased HPA activity, as evidenced by an immediate rise in ACTH and cortisol levels [ 87 88 89 90 Interestingly, endogenous opioids, which are usually released in response to stress, have been shown to contribute to stress-induced analgesia and may be mobilised as a compensatory mechanism in PTSD [ 30 91 92 93 94 28 30 Furthermore, administering exogenous opioids disrupts this balance by inhibiting glucocorticoid release, thereby removing a crucial negative feedback mechanism within the central stress response [ 44 54 65 95 96 97 98 99 28 86 100 101 Finally, HUD has been shown to cause significant dysregulation of the stress system, particularly marked by hyperactivation of the HPA axis, leading to exaggerated cortisol and ACTH responses during both naloxone-precipitated and natural withdrawal [ 96 102 103 104 105 3 95 106 107 65 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 49 116 102 117 54 In summary, HUD has been shown to induce changes in the stress system, resulting in the suppression of glucocorticoids and an increase in CRF and norepinephrine activity. This impairs stress adaptation and extends hyperactivation of central stress circuits. Such dysregulation may promote both relapse and the development of PTSD after trauma that might otherwise resolve without lasting psychopathology. Therefore, these converging lines of evidence suggest that heroin use does not merely correlate with trauma symptoms through environmental factors but actively alters neurobiological systems involved in stress, fear conditioning, and emotional regulation. In this context, heroin dependence also seems to be a neurobiologically traumatising condition, supporting the view that PTSD/S are rooted both in personal experience and in the pharmacological effects of opioids on the traumatisation process ( Figure 1 4. Clinical Evidence of the Post-Heroin PTSD Spectrum This dimensional approach to trauma has become increasingly prominent, particularly in fields such as affective neuroscience and complex trauma research, where symptoms like emotional numbing, interpersonal detachment, and affective dysregulation are recognised as trauma-related, even without a single catastrophic trigger [ 74 118 In the field of SUDs, particularly concerning HUD, this trauma-spectrum model is especially significant. Here, the order may be reversed: instead of trauma resulting in substance use, it is the substance use itself, through its physiological, relational, and existential effects, that can foster trauma-like vulnerability. HUD, notably, demonstrates a persistent pattern of threat, loss, and disintegration that closely resembles prolonged traumatic exposure [ 3 We therefore propose the construct of pH-PTSD/S: a condition in which chronic heroin dependence results in lasting hypersensitivity to stress and emotional instability, presenting as trauma-spectrum symptoms that endure even after detoxification. In current addiction discourse, trauma is mainly viewed as a factor that predisposes individuals to substance use. However, growing clinical evidence and theoretical considerations highlight the need to explore the opposite: the possibility that heroin dependence itself can generate a spectrum of post-traumatic stress. We introduce the concept of PTSD/S—a trauma-like response pattern that develops not from a single catastrophic event, but from the prolonged psychological effects of heroin addiction and the increased reactivity to everyday stressors that follow. Unlike traditional PTSD, which results from sudden, life-threatening events, PTSD/S reflects a long-term sensitisation of the stress response system. People with HUD often exhibit extreme emotional sensitivity even to relatively minor interpersonal conflicts, experiences of loss, or daily frustrations. This phenomenon is not merely psychological fragility; it stems from neurobiological and experiential conditioning through repeated cycles of intoxication, withdrawal, isolation, and existential instability. Heroin impairs the ability to recover emotionally. Repeated exposure to distressing physical states, such as withdrawal crises, mimics patterns of uncontrollable threats that disrupt the brain’s regulatory systems. Over time, the individual becomes hypersensitive to any negative emotional trigger, including common life events like bereavement, rejection, or work-related stress. These experiences are no longer processed with suitable emotional responses but instead trigger intrusive distress, avoidance, and dysphoric arousal: the key characteristics of post-traumatic syndromes. 4.1. Comparative Analysis of Stress Reactivity Before and After Heroin Addiction Onset A significant contribution to understanding trauma-related processes in heroin addiction comes from a study by the Vincent P. Dole Research Group at the Santa Chiara University Hospital in Pisa, Italy. This research explored the role of life events—including losses and potentially traumatic experiences—in the onset and development of HUD, focusing on the emotional responses they elicited before and after the start of continuous heroin use [ 119 The study involved 82 heroin-dependent individuals recruited from addiction services in Central-Northern Italy. Using the Drug Addiction History Questionnaire (DAH-Q) and the Trauma and Loss Spectrum (TALS) instruments, researchers examined the occurrence of significant life events, their emotional impact, and trauma-related reactions, such as avoidance, arousal, and maladaptive behaviours, across two life phases: pre-addiction and addiction. The findings showed that stressful events were common before starting heroin use, with only a small minority reporting no previous exposure to loss or trauma. However, despite the shorter duration of the addiction phase, the number of reported events increased after heroin use began, indicating that addiction itself encourages exposure to traumatic circumstances, especially legal issues, interpersonal ruptures, and ongoing instability. More importantly, participants reported a significant rise in emotional reactivity after heroin initiation. Reactions to loss events grew stronger in 50% of cases, as did the recall of the most serious event (41.5%), emotional numbing (46.3%), maladaptive behaviours (56.1%), and arousal (42.7%). These changes happened without notable shifts in personality traits, suggesting that the drug-using experience itself heightens trauma responsiveness in ways similar to a post-traumatic stress phenotype. These results reinforce broader findings in the literature linking SUDs to higher stress sensitivity and reduced capacity for emotional regulation [ 3 120 121 Importantly, while traditional trauma predictors—such as the death of a parent, parental divorce, and emotional neglect—were dominant before the onset of heroin use [ 3 4.2. Converging Trajectories: Towards a Unified Model of PTSD and HUD The growing recognition of trauma-related psychopathology as a spectrum has opened new conceptual pathways for understanding the complex connection between PTSD and SUDs. Moving beyond dual-disorder models, a dimensional approach allows us to see these disorders not as separate but as interconnected and mutually reinforcing processes. In this context, heroin addiction—when viewed through the lens of traumatic sensitisation and emotional dysregulation—may exemplify the PTSD-SUD spectrum. One of our studies aimed to empirically test this hypothesis by examining the correlations between the severity of heroin addiction and PTSD/S symptoms in a clinical sample of patients undergoing treatment with opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in three Italian addiction units [ 122 Results indicated that the severity of PTSD/S symptoms—particularly arousal, maladaptive coping, and re-experiencing—was positively correlated with the duration of heroin use. Specifically, longer dependence periods and earlier initiation of heroin consumption were linked to more severe trauma-related symptoms. Conversely, patients on higher doses of opioid agonists (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine) reported significantly fewer arousal symptoms, supporting the notion that stable agonist treatment may serve a protective role against trauma responses. Further analyses confirmed that polysubstance users and patients in more advanced stages of addiction exhibited higher scores across nearly all trauma-related domains, including loss, re-experiencing, avoidance, and emotional dysregulation. Patients with a treatment history also showed higher PTSD/S symptomatology compared to those in their initial therapeutic contact, suggesting cumulative sensitisation to trauma throughout the course of addiction. Although some discriminant functions did not reach statistical significance, the clinical pattern remained consistent. Importantly, these findings support previous research indicating that short-acting opioids like heroin interfere with the endogenous opioid system, increasing susceptibility to stress and decreasing emotional resilience [ 3 55 97 98 The broader implication of these findings challenges simple yes-or-no thinking. Instead of seeing PTSD and heroin addiction as separate diagnoses that sometimes overlap, this evidence supports a unified model based on shared vulnerabilities, common neurobiological roots, and mutually strengthening progressions. Traits such as impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and low resilience, often viewed as individual predispositions, could act as transdiagnostic risk factors affecting both disorders [ 123 In summary, our study emphasises that PTSD/S symptoms should be regarded as inherent elements of heroin addiction psychopathology, rather than merely as precursors or co-occurring conditions. The robustness and consistency of the observed correlations imply that HUD both reflects and intensifies traumatised functioning. This realisation calls for a redefinition of clinical strategies—advocating for integrated, trauma-informed approaches instead of isolated treatment pathways—and aligns with the emerging view of PTSD/S as a distinct clinical entity. 4.3. Trauma Without Disaster: PTSD/Symptomatology in Heroin Users Compared to Earthquake Survivors This comparative study aimed to determine whether individuals with HUD, despite never experiencing catastrophic events, display emotional and behavioural responses to loss and trauma similar to those seen in survivors of natural disasters diagnosed with PTSD. Three demographically matched groups were assessed: patients with chronic HUD (N = 77), survivors of the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake (EQ) with diagnosed PTSD (EQ-PTSD, N = 77), and survivors of the same event without PTSD diagnosis (EQ-NPTSD, N = 77). All participants completed standardised instruments, including the SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders) for diagnosing PTSD and the TALS [ 124 Despite differences in age and socioeconomic background between the groups, HUD patients reported levels of PTSD/S symptomatology similar to those observed in the EQ-PTSD group and significantly higher than those in the EQ-NPTSD group. Specifically, HUD patients exhibited elevated scores in domains such as grief reactions, hyperarousal, re-experiencing, avoidance, and maladaptive coping. While their symptom levels were slightly lower than those of the EQ-PTSD group, they were consistently and significantly higher than those of the non-PTSD earthquake survivors. Discriminant function analysis confirmed that the HUD group could not be statistically distinguished from the EQ-PTSD group based on emotional reactions to traumatic and loss-related events [ 125 The results also align with previous research on other chronic health conditions, such as cancer [ 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 96 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 101 141 142 Moreover, consistent with earlier work [ 122 126 122 143 144 97 145 146 122 4.4. Trait Psychopathology and Emotional Reactivity In one of our studies, patients were divided into two subgroups based on the severity of their PTSD/S symptoms, as determined by a TALS total score above or below the cut-off value of 32. The high PTSD/S subgroup (H-PTSD/S) exhibited more severe psychopathology across all five Symptomatologic Checklist (SCL-90)-derived dimensions previously identified as characteristic of SUDs: worthlessness–being trapped (W/BT), somatic symptoms (SSs), sensitivity–psychoticism (S/P), panic–anxiety (PA), and violence–suicide (V/S) [ 147 148 Although clear correlations exist between emotional responses and specific dimensions of psychopathology, no qualitative differences in typology appeared between the L-PTSD/S and H-PTSD/S subgroups. In other words, while symptom severity varied considerably, the fundamental structure of psychopathology remained stable, thus supporting the hypothesis that it is trait-dependent rather than state-dependent, specific to HUD. These findings reinforce prior evidence of a five-factor structure across substances and contexts [ 149 150 151 Furthermore, as the PTSD spectrum appears sensitive to addiction progression, its monitoring could act as a prognostic marker in clinical practice. Patients with heightened PTSD/S symptoms—especially those linked to arousal and aggression—might require customised interventions, including stabilising stress systems through OAT [ 3 152 153 154 4.5. Clinical Profiles of PTSD/S Patients In this study, we aimed to examine the distinct psychopathological and clinical profiles of HUD patients who, during treatment, exhibited a PTSD/S condition (H-PTSD/S) compared with those who did not (L-PTSD/S) [ 155 Data were gathered through a demographic survey and the DAH-Q [ 156 147 157 158 125 159 The presence of Benzodiazepine (BDZ) use and heightened psychopathology were key indicators of H-PTSD/S status, suggesting these factors may indicate treatment resistance or incomplete response to OAT. These findings align with earlier studies linking SUD and PTSD spectrum symptoms [ 122 125 160 4.6. PTSD/S and Long-Term Outcomes of Continuous Treatment A unique longitudinal study spanning almost three decades examined seven HUD patients who received continuous OAT since the early 1990s at Santa Chiara University Hospital in Pisa, Italy [ 161 162 122 148 These findings challenge the prevailing short-term model of opioid agonist treatment. Instead, they advocate viewing HUD as a chronic psychiatric illness that requires indefinite maintenance therapy when specific psychopathological markers—such as addictive behaviours, the persistence of the W/BT dimension, and H-PTSD/S symptomatology–remain unresolved. In line with existing literature [ 163 164 4.7. Future Directions The TALS, developed by the Spectrum Project, has proven valid for assessing PTSD/S symptomatology [ 159 165 166 Preliminary data from the pH-PTSD/S questionnaire indicate that this trauma-spectrum reactivity is measurable and clinically significant. Originally designed to capture trauma-related symptoms in heroin-dependent patients even without discrete trauma exposure, the pH-PTSD/S reflects a functional spectrum of distress originating from the addiction experience itself [ 166 167 The conceptualisation of heroin dependence as a traumatising condition—mediated by the chronic dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system and the consequent sensitisation to stress—has several important implications for future clinical practice and research. From a diagnostic perspective, this model emphasises the need for trauma screening protocols that go beyond identifying discrete, life-threatening events. In patients with HUD, subthreshold and complex trauma symptoms should be actively evaluated using dimensional tools capable of capturing dysregulation-related phenomena. Importantly, we clarify that our hypothesis does not claim that heroin dependence, per se, fulfils Criterion A for trauma exposure as defined in the DSM-5. Instead, we propose that the chronic neurobiological and psychosocial dysregulation linked to heroin addiction may lead to PTSD-spectrum symptoms that remain clinically relevant despite not arising from a single identifiable traumatic event. The PTSD-spectrum framework may therefore provide a more accurate depiction of the emotional and cognitive impairments often seen in this population, as previously discussed [ 93 94 To address potential concerns about diagnostic overlap, we differentiate the post-heroin PTSD-spectrum (pH-PTSD/S) from other clinical conditions. Unlike protracted withdrawal syndrome, which usually resolves over time and is closely associated with pharmacological cessation, pH-PTSD/S indicates a broader pattern of persistent emotional dysregulation, intrusive symptoms, and psychosocial impairment that persist independently of acute withdrawal. Similarly, while affective dysregulation is common in addiction, pH-PTSD/S is characterised by trauma-like features—such as hyperarousal, avoidance, and intrusive memories—that more closely resemble stressor-related psychopathology. In contrast to complex PTSD resulting from external adverse life events, pH-PTSD/S is hypothesised to originate mainly from the cumulative internal traumatisation linked to heroin use itself and its long-term neurobiological effects. From a nosological perspective, we do not propose pH-PTSD/S as a formal diagnostic category within DSM-5 or ICD-11 frameworks. Instead, we view it as a dimensional construct within the broader PTSD spectrum, aimed at capturing stress-related psychopathology in individuals with HUD who do not meet full PTSD criteria but exhibit clinically significant trauma-like symptoms. This conceptualisation is not intended to inflate diagnostic categories but to support trauma-informed assessment and treatment planning through a more nuanced understanding of stress vulnerability in this population. At the service level, the adoption of trauma-informed care models becomes crucial. The high prevalence of trauma-spectrum symptoms in HUD patients necessitates coordinated interventions that combine pharmacological stabilisation with psychotherapeutic strategies aimed at emotional regulation and stress resilience. Service organisation may also benefit from interdisciplinary models that bring together addiction specialists, trauma clinicians, and primary care providers. From a research perspective, the trauma sensitisation hypothesis provides multiple avenues for investigation. Longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether opioid-induced neurobiological dysregulation predicts the development or persistence of trauma-spectrum syndromes. Neuroendocrine biomarkers such as cortisol, ACTH, or CRF levels could be included in routine monitoring routines to observe individual trajectories under OAT. Additionally, neuroimaging studies might help identify structural and functional markers of opioid-induced trauma vulnerability, particularly within the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and brainstem regions involved in stress regulation [ 30 99 Finally, the development and validation of specific tools—such as the PTSD/Spectrum questionnaire proposed in this article—may help improve both diagnosis and treatment tracking in complex dual-diagnosis groups. These instruments could assist in distinguishing between traditional PTSD, subthreshold trauma syndromes, and opioid-induced stress dysregulation, thereby enabling more personalised interventions. In conclusion, the hypothesis that heroin dependence is a traumatising condition in itself opens new perspectives for diagnosis, clinical care, and neurobiological research. Future research should aim to operationalise this model through empirical studies, clinical tools, and revised guidelines for the long-term management of HUD within a trauma-informed framework. 5. Implications for Trauma-Informed Care and the Role of Opioid Agonist Treatment From a clinical perspective, this model promotes a shift from symptom-focused treatment approaches towards interventions that address the fundamental dysregulation of stress regulatory systems. In this context, opioid agonist treatment (OAT)—especially with long-acting formulations such as methadone and buprenorphine—may provide therapeutic benefits that go beyond managing withdrawal symptoms and preventing relapse. Several studies have shown that OAT can reduce hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis hyperreactivity, potentially aiding in the re-stabilisation of neuroendocrine stress responses commonly dysregulated in PTSD and HUD [ 44 54 65 Furthermore, OAT may indirectly decrease PTSD-spectrum symptoms by reducing environmental instability and repeated exposure to high-risk contexts often associated with illicit opioid use. By lowering contact with traumagenic situations—such as homelessness, criminal involvement, and interpersonal violence—OAT offers a more predictable and secure psychosocial environment, which can, in turn, lower the risk of trauma re-exposure and aid emotional regulation [ 52 53 Nonetheless, while observational data suggest that individuals receiving OAT may experience a reduction in PTSD symptom severity, the direct effects of opioid agonists on trauma-related symptoms such as intrusive recollections, dissociation, and hyperarousal remain insufficiently investigated. Randomised controlled trials are needed to clarify whether OAT helps improve PTSD symptoms independently of its effects on substance use. Additionally, the different impacts of full opioid agonists (e.g., methadone) versus partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine) on the neurobiological mechanisms of stress regulation deserve further examination [ 62 86 The converging neurobiological and psychosocial mechanisms underlying both HUD and PTSD support the perspective that OAT, when provided within a trauma-informed framework, may serve a dual purpose: reducing addiction-related behaviours and partially restoring homeostatic stress regulation. Future clinical strategies should include systematic screening for trauma-related symptoms and consider integrated pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions that address both substance dependence and trauma vulnerability within this highly exposed population. 6. Limitations and Strengths of pH-PTSD/S This perspective article is mainly conceptual and aims to generate hypotheses. Although a consistent body of clinical research supports the proposed construct of pH-PTSD/S, it has not yet been formally validated through large-scale, multicentre studies. Many of the cited investigations are observational and conducted within specific clinical settings, which may limit the applicability of their findings to broader populations or healthcare systems. Additionally, the use of self-report instruments—although psychometrically validated—may introduce recall or reporting bias, especially among traumatised or substance-using individuals. Several studies discussed rely on retrospective designs, which may obscure the temporal relationship between heroin use and the development of trauma-spectrum symptomatology. It is also plausible that specific neurobiological alterations attributed to heroin dependence reflect pre-existing vulnerabilities rather than addiction-related changes. Furthermore, although the dimensional model of pH-PTSD/S proposed herein offers a valuable heuristic, its integration into formal diagnostic systems remains speculative and awaits nosological refinement. Nevertheless, this article offers a novel and clinically grounded reconceptualization of heroin addiction, not merely as a comorbid condition but as a chronic traumatising process. A key strength is the integration of empirical evidence and theoretical insights within a unified methodological and cultural framework, which improves the internal consistency of the proposed construct. By moving beyond the traditional dual disorder paradigm, this work introduces a dimensional model that captures the complex lived experiences of heroin-dependent individuals. The examination of neurobiological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms through which heroin use may generate trauma-spectrum features contributes to a more nuanced understanding of addiction psychopathology. Finally, the perspective aligns with contemporary advances in trauma-informed and transdiagnostic approaches to psychiatric care. The inclusion of comparative analyses with traditional PTSD populations and the development of specific screening tools further improve the clinical relevance of the construct, paving the way for future research and more personalised therapeutic strategies. 7. Conclusions This perspective article introduces the construct of pH-PTSD/S, proposing that heroin addiction may itself serve as a chronic traumatising condition. Rather than merely co-occurring with trauma-related disorders, pH-PTSD/S signifies a stress-spectrum syndrome intrinsically linked to the lived experience of long-term heroin dependence.
