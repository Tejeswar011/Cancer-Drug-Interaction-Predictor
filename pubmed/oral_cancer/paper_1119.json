The pathological features of AD include the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and Tau, which disrupt neuronal function and communication, ultimately leading to neuronal loss and brain atrophy. Efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathological changes have led to advancements in diagnostic techniques and potential therapeutic interventions. However, the complexity of AD necessitates further research to develop more effective treatments and, ideally, preventive measures. Extensive research suggests that diminishing mTOR signaling increases lifespan and health span across various species. Increased PI3K/mTOR signaling has been linked to the progression of AD pathology, leading to neuronal degeneration and impairments in cognitive function. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of PF-04691502, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-like pathology using male and female B6.Cg-Tg(APPswe, PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax mice (APP/PS1), a well-established transgenic model of AD. Eighteen-month-old APP/PS1 and wild-type mice received oral administration of PF-04691502 at a dose of 1 mg/kg for 12 weeks. Following the treatment period, spatial learning and memory were evaluated using the Morris water maze. Subsequently, the mice brains were collected for neuropathological and biochemical assessments. Our findings showed that PF-04691502 enhanced cognitive performance in APP/PS1 mice and significantly reduced insoluble Aβ accumulation in the brain. Mechanistically, these effects were associated with enhanced autophagy induction. Treatment with PF-04691502 increased the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, upregulated Beclin-1, and elevated LAMP-2 levels, indicative of stimulated autophagosome formation and lysosomal activity. Overall, these preclinical results suggest that PF-04691502 holds promise as a potential therapeutic agent for AD and other aging-related neurodegenerative diseases involving mTOR pathway dysregulation.

Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide, affecting people’s lives by leading to a gradual loss of cognitive functions, memory, and daily abilities [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Several risk factors have been associated with sporadic AD, including non-modifiable and modifiable ones. The former include gender, age, genetics and family history; the latter include physical activity, smoking, education, staying socially and mentally active, blood pressure and diet [ 8 APP PS1 PS2 9 10 The APP 11 12 13 14 15 PS1 16 PS2 17 18 19 Under physiological conditions, Tau binds to microtubules stabilizing their shape; in AD, this protein undergoes hyperphosphorylation, structural misfolding, and aggregation, resulting in neurofibrillary tangles [ 7 20 21 mTOR is one of the major modulators of autophagy and its activity is regulated by several signaling pathways, including those that detect the cell’s energy level and initiate or stop the production of proteins [ 22 23 24 25 Given the involvement of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in AD pathogenesis, we sought to evaluate the effects of a 12-week daily oral treatment with PF-04691502 on AD-like pathology of 18-month-old APP/PS1 mice. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials Unless otherwise indicated, all compounds were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other chemicals were of the highest commercial grade available. All stock solutions were prepared in non-pyrogenic saline (0.9% NaCl; Baxter, Rome, Italy). 2.2. Animals Adult male and female B6.Cg-Tg(APPswe, PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax mice (30–35 g; 18 months old at the beginning of the study), hereafter referred to as APP/PS1 mice, along with age- and weight-matched wild-type (WT) controls, with no signs of illness or abnormal behavior at baseline, were housed under standardized conditions. No additional specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied. APP/PS1 mice were selected because they represent a well-established model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These mice express a chimeric mouse/human amyloid precursor protein (Mo/HuAPP695swe) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9), both associated with early-onset familial AD in humans. The humanized APP transgene enables the production of human Aβ peptides, which are central to amyloid plaque formation. This model was chosen because APP/PS1 mice reliably develop age-dependent beta-amyloid deposition in the brain, beginning at 6–7 months of age, thereby recapitulating key neuropathological features of human AD. All animals were maintained at 22 ± 1 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle and had free access to food and water. Mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Stock No. 005864), Bar Harbor, Maine, USA. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with Italian animal welfare regulations (D.M.116/92), the European Directive (2010/63/EU), and the ARRIVE guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize pain and distress, including the use of non-invasive oral treatment, enriched housing, and daily monitoring. No unexpected adverse effects related to PF-04691502 administration were observed. Humane endpoints were predefined (e.g., >20% weight loss, severe distress, seizures). Animals were monitored daily, and none required early euthanasia. The animal study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Ministero della Salute (protocol code 938/2024; approval date: 27 September 2024). 2.3. Treatment with PF-04691502 Mice were treated daily with PF-04691502 (HY-15177, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) (1 mg/kg) by oral administration for 12 weeks. The dose was consistent with previously published work [ 26 26 Supplementary Figure S1 2.4. Experimental Groups Both APP/PS1 and WT mice were given PF-04691502 or vehicle daily for 12 weeks ( n WT + vehicle: the animals in this group were vehicle-only-treated (15 males). APP/PS1 + vehicle: the animals in this group were vehicle-only-treated (8 males and 7 females). WT + PF: the animals in this group were treated with 1 mg/kg PF-04691502 (15 males). APP/PS1 + PF: the animals in this group were treated with 1 mg/kg PF-04691502 (5 males and 10 females). Group allocation was known only to the researcher responsible for assigning animals to treatment groups. The personnel conducting the experiments, performing outcome assessments, and analyzing the data were blinded to group allocation to minimize bias. All animals were included in the experiments and subsequent data analysis. 2.5. Behavioral Test The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed for 5 consecutive days to evaluate memory and spatial learning. The test was conducted as previously described [ 27 2.6. Western Blot Analyses Western blot analyses were conducted to assess mTOR levels, Microtubule-Associated Proteins 1A/1B Light Chain 3B (MAPLC3 or LC3), Beclin-1 (BECN1), Sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62), Lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) and phospho-p70 S6 Kinase (p-p70S6 kinase). After the sacrifice, the animal’s whole brains were removed and cytosolic and nuclear fractions were extracted, as described by Ardizzone et al. [ 28 w v 2.7. Immunohistochemical Analysis of Tyrosine Hydrolase (TH) and β-Amyloid 1-42 Immunohistochemistry analysis of TH in the substantia nigra of mouse brains was conducted as described by Esposito and colleagues [ 29 2.8. Congo Red Staining To highlight the presence of amyloid plaques, we conducted a Congo Red staining. After removing the excess paraffin, sections were progressively hydrated with a decreasing scale of alcohol and then processed using a Congo Red kit (04-210822; Bio-Optica, Milan, Italy), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then the slides were dehydrated with an increasing scale of alcohol, up to xylene, and mounted [ 30 2.9. Statistical Analysis Experimental data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), with N t p 3. Results 3.1. PF-04691502 Treatment Improves Spatial Learning and Memory in APP/PS1 Mice PF-04691502 administration did not induce relevant alterations in body weight during the intervention. As shown in the Supplementary Figure S1 To assess the effects of PF-04691502, we tested spatial learning and memory in treated mice using the Morris water maze (MWM). Notably, our study was not powered to identify potential sex differences. On the first day of testing, no significant differences were observed among groups ( Supplementary Figure S2 p Figure 1 The Bonferroni multiple comparisons test revealed that the APP/PS1 + PF group showed significantly improved performance compared to the APP/PS1 + vehicle group on day 2 ( p p p p p p p Supplementary Figure S3A To test reference memory, 24 h after the last training trial, we removed the hidden platform and gave the mice an additional 60-s training trial. We recorded the amount of time taken to cross the location where the platform was hidden ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 p p Figure 1 p Figure 1 p p p Figure 1 Supplementary Figure S3C,D Supplementary Figure S3B 3.2. PF-04691502 Treatment Reduces Hyperactivity of mTOR and p-p70S6K Several laboratories have reported that the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway is overactive in AD and is associated with the accumulation of Aβ and Tau [ 31 32 33 34 35 Figure 2 p p Figure 2 36 Figure 2 p Figure 2 p Figure 2 p p Figure 2 p Figure 2 p 3.3. PF-04691502 Treatment Reduces Aβ Accumulation To assess the efficacy of the treatment on AD-like neuropathology, we first evaluated Aβ pathology by immunohistochemical analysis. We found that Aβ1-42 was significantly reduced in APP/PS1 animals treated with PF-04691502 compared to APP/PS1 animals that received vehicle only ( Figure 3 37 Figure 3 Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S4 3.4. PF-04691502 Modulates Autophagy mTOR is a negative regulator of autophagy [ 38 39 40 41 42 41 43 Figure 4 p p p Figure 4 LAMP-2 is a lysosomal protein required for the final phase of autophagy, which involves the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes [ 44 45 46 47 48 49 Figure 4 p p Figure 4 3.5. PF-04691502 Treatment Increases the Expression of TH Dopamine plays an important role in learning and memory and deficits in this neurotransmitter are linked to AD [ 50 51 52 53 Figure 5 3.6. PF-04691502 Attenuates Glial Activation and Neuroinflammation Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a marked increase in the activation of both astrocytes and microglia in the APP/PS1 group, as indicated by enhanced GFAP and Iba1 immunoreactivity ( Figure 6 Figure 6 4. Discussion Strong evidence links the PI3K/mTOR pathway to AD pathogenesis. In previous studies, we have shown that mTOR is hyperactive in human brains and in transgenic mice of AD brains, demonstrating the close correlation between mTOR and the progression of Aβ and Tau [ 35 36 During the MWM test, both WT and APP/PS1 animals that received PF-04691502 orally showed an improvement in learning and memory throughout the test. PF-04691502 treatment in APP/PS1 animals yielded promising results; indeed, the animals already after a few days began to reach the platform hidden under the surface of the water proving to have learned the position and being able to orient in the space available. These results are consistent with data in the literature linking mTOR hyperactivation with memory deficit in mouse models of AD [ 54 55 56 35 57 58 59 To confirm the action on the target, we evaluated the molecular expression of some key factors of the PI3K/mTOR pathway in the brains of APP/PS1 mice treated with the inhibitor. Treatment with PF-04691502 reduced the levels of p-mTOR, confirming the modulation of this signaling pathway, often linked to the improvement of learning and memory [ 56 60 61 To assess Aβ load in 18-month-old mice, we performed different histological analyses; transgenic animals treated with the vehicle showed numerous Aβ plaques, which were reduced by chronic PF-04691502 administration. This result was also confirmed by Congo Red staining, which revealed a decreased immunopositive signal of Aβ, especially in the cortex and hippocampus. Our findings align with prior research indicating that rapamycin treatment decreases the accumulation of Aβ and fibrillar aggregates of Aβ by approximately 40–50% in 3xTg-AD mice over 16 months [ 58 55 62 63 64 Unlike rapamycin, which selectively inhibits mTORC1, PF-04691502 is a dual inhibitor of mTORC1/2, potentially leading to broader effects on cellular metabolism and survival pathways. Everolimus and temsirolimus, rapamycin analogues and selective mTORC1 inhibitors, have also been studied for their potential neuroprotective effects in AD, due to their ability to enhance autophagy, reduce Aβ accumulation, and alleviate tau pathology [ 65 66 67 25 In recent years, accumulating evidence has demonstrated a link between AD-related memory dysfunction and deficits in dopaminergic signaling in patients [ 68 69 70 50 71 72 73 51 52 53 51 53 The PI3K/mTOR signaling is linked with the modulation of autophagy, a process of degradation and recycling of cellular components, including damaged cellular organelles, poorly folded proteins, and other unnecessary cellular structures [ 74 75 76 77 78 79 33 Our data also suggest that autophagy induction may be impaired in untreated APP/PS1 mice. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that markers such as p-mTOR, Beclin-1, and LAMP-2 are significantly altered in APP/PS1 transgenic mice compared to wild-type mice [ 42 80 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 We acknowledge the limitations of our study related to the lack of sex-based analyses. Our experimental design was not originally conceived to assess sex as a biological variable, and therefore was not powered or structured to systematically evaluate sex-related differences. However, we recognize the scientific relevance of this aspect, particularly in the context of Alzheimer’s disease, where sex-specific differences in pathology and behavior have been previously reported. To address this limitation as thoroughly as possible within the constraints of our study, we have included in the Supplementary Figure S3 Another limitation of our study is the lack of direct evidence regarding PF-04691502 brain penetration, drug levels, and target engagement in central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Although the compound possesses favorable physicochemical characteristics, including moderate lipophilicity, good oral bioavailability, and a relatively low molecular weight (425.5 g/mol), no published preclinical studies have quantitatively assessed its distribution or the extent of sustained target inhibition specifically in the brain. While these properties support the possibility of blood–brain barrier permeability, this remains to be experimentally validated. Notably, PF-04691502 was originally developed as an anticancer drug and underwent a phase 1 clinical trial, where the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined at 8 mg per day. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 fatigue at 8 mg, grade 3 rash at 11 mg, and grade 2 intolerable fatigue at 11 mg. Common treatment-related adverse events comprised fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, hyperglycemia, rash, and vomiting. The observed alteration in glucose homeostasis, characterized by increased fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels, indicates a significant systemic metabolic impact [ 25 5. Conclusions The results shown here suggest that changes in the autophagy pathway following mTOR inhibition improve learning and memory. Thus, although PF-04691502 deserves further investigation to clarify its efficacy and safety, it can be considered a valid therapeutic agent, capable of improving learning and memory while decreasing Aβ deposits in the brain.
