Design and method: An online survey was conducted among 310 U.S. university students from mid-June to mid-July 2021, measuring worry about COVID-19, COVID-19 risk perception (perceived probability and perceived severity), vaccine perception (perceived vaccine safety and perceived vaccine effectiveness), and vaccine acceptance, along with demographics. Three models were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM): (1) worry, risk-perception, and vaccine-perception variables influence vaccine acceptance simultaneously; (2) worry partially mediates the relationships between risk/vaccine-perception variables and vaccine acceptance; (3) risk- and vaccine-perception variables partially mediate the relationship between worry and vaccine acceptance. All models are the originally specified models. Results: Results of SEM analyses suggest that Model (3) fit the data best (CFI = 1.000, TLI = 1.000, and RMSEA = 0.000). SEM analysis for Model (3) found that perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 is negatively, worry about COVID-19 is positively, and perceived vaccine safety (the strongest predictor) is positively associated with vaccine acceptance. Perceived severity of contracting COVID-19 and perceived vaccine effectiveness are non-significant predictors. Worry indirectly affects vaccine acceptance through perceived probability (negative) and perceived vaccine safety (positive). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine campaigns targeting college students should emphasize vaccine safety, use reasonable worry as an emotional cue, and avoid overemphasizing the likelihood of contracting COVID-19.

Clear and transparent campaigns about vaccine safety can significantly motivate college students to accept COVID-19 vaccines. This aligns with Scott et al.’s (2021) review, which emphasized addressing vaccine mistrust to foster acceptance.  1 not Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a national emergency in the U.S. on March 13, 2020 2  3  4  5 Worry about COVID-19 has been identified as an important determinant of COVID-19 vaccine-related intentions and behaviors. Studies conducted in the U.S. have found that lower levels of worry about becoming infected with COVID-19 predict vaccine delay,  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 Although the above studies have consistently revealed an association between worry about COVID-19 and vaccination intentions or behaviors, most have not examined the potential theoretical mechanisms underlying this relationship. Among the above studies, it appears that only Hilverda and Vollmann (2021) have explored such a mechanism, suggesting that worry about COVID-19 mediates the relationship between perceived severity of the disease (a component of cognitive risk perception) and vaccination intention.  9 Theoretical frameworks Individuals’ decisions to accept the COVID-19 vaccine are likely to be influenced not only by cognitive evaluations, such as perceived susceptibility and severity, but also by affective responses (i.e. feelings).  13 The Health Belief Model (HBM) proposes that health behaviors are influenced by perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits and barriers, and self-efficacy (Rosenstock et al., 1988).  14  15 Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) explicitly incorporate affective responses—specifically fear—as an important construct within their models. 16 17 16 17 An important distinction between PMT/EPPM and HBM is that the former explicitly model fear as an emotional construct, while HBM treats feelings more implicitly. Moreover, PMT/ EPPM are narrowly focused on fear, whereas HBM allows for the consideration of a broader range of emotional cues, though not formally defined within the model. The Risk-as-Feelings hypothesis differs fundamentally from the above theories by proposing that (1) feelings have a direct effect on judgments and decisions which “need not be cognitively mediated,” (as opposed to the above theories, which all assume that feelings are mediated by cognitions); (2) feelings mediate, at least partially, the relationship between cognitive evaluations of risk and behavioral decisions/behaviors (again, the opposite relationship posited by the above theories; p. 272).  13 Taken together, these distinctions raise important questions: In the context of COVID-19 vaccination, do feelings and cognitive beliefs each have a direct influence on behavior/intention? Is behavior/intention primarily driven by cognitive beliefs that mediate emotional responses, or by emotional responses that mediate cognitive beliefs? The current study seeks to empirically test these competing assumptions. Worry about COVID-19 The present study focuses on worry, rather than other emotional responses, for several reasons. First, empirical evidence indicates that worry was one of the most prevalent emotional responses during the COVID-19 pandemic, surpassing other negative emotions including sadness, anger, and depression.  18 Second, while fear is a central construct in both Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), it is “a present-oriented and short-lived response to an identifiable and specific threat” (p. 190).  19 20 21  22 Third, worry has consistently been identified as a key emotional factor predicting preventive health behaviors, including vaccination. 23 24 6 7 By focusing on worry, the present study aims to capture an emotional construct that was not only prevalent and enduring during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also theoretically appropriate for explaining protective behaviors (e.g. vaccination) that emerge in response to long-term uncertain health threats. COVID-19 risk perception and vaccine perception In efforts to predict COVID-19 vaccination intentions and behaviors, a substantial body of research has focused on cognitive factors such as risk perception—defined as individuals’ beliefs about the probability and severity of contracting COVID-19 9 25  11 Risk Perception of COVID-19 Several studies have examined how individuals’ COVID-19 risk perception influences their willingness or intention to receive a vaccine. Chen et al. (2023) found that perceived severity of COVID-19 was a significant predictor of vaccination willingness, whereas perceived susceptibility (i.e. the perceived likelihood/probability of getting infected by COVID-19) was not.  8  10  9 Vaccine perception: Safety and effectiveness A second major focus in the literature has been individuals’ beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. Coleman et al. (2024) observed that concerns about both safety and effectiveness were associated with increased vaccine hesitancy.  11  6  26 Although findings vary across studies, a consistent pattern emerges: cognitive beliefs—including perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived severity of COVID-19, and perceived vaccine safety and effectiveness—as well as COVID-19-related worry, appear to play important roles in shaping COVID-19 vaccination intentions and behaviors. However, these predictors have often been studied in isolation or in limited combinations, without an integrated framework that jointly examines their influence. The present study seeks to address this gap by simultaneously examining multiple cognitive and affective predictors of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance—namely, perceived probability, perceived severity, vaccine safety and effectiveness perceptions, and worry about COVID-19. In doing so, it aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how these factors collectively shape vaccine decision-making. College students The present study focused on the college student population for three reasons. First, college students are considered at higher risk for COVID-19 transmission due to their frequent social interactions in shared living spaces, classrooms, and campus events, which facilitate the spread of the virus. 27 28  29 30 31  32  31 Given the role of the college student population in transmission dynamics and the evidence of their vaccine hesitancy, it is important to understand and address college students’ intentions or acceptance toward COVID-19 vaccination. Promoting vaccine uptake across all population sectors—including college students—is essential for preventing future pandemics. Therefore, the present study specifically examines the college student population. Research questions To explain the relationships among worry about COVID-19, COVID-19 risk perceptions (including perceived probability and perceived severity), vaccine perceptions (including perceived safety and perceived effectiveness), and vaccine acceptance among college students, the present study proposes three competing path models, drawing upon the theoretical frameworks reviewed above: (1) worry, the two risk-perception variables, and the two vaccine-perception variables influence vaccine acceptance simultaneously (see Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 1. Hypothesized model (1). Figure 2. Hypothesized model (2). Figure 3. Hypothesized model (3). The following research questions are posed: RQ1: Which of the three proposed models best fit the data? RQ2: Based on the best-fitting model, what are the direct and indirect effects of worry about COVID-19, risk perception of COVID-19, and vaccine perception on vaccine acceptance? Figures 1 3 Method COVID-19 situation and policies during data collection After the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the lead author conducted an online survey from mid-June to mid-July 2021 at a public university in the state of Texas, U.S. As of mid-July 2021, Texas’ positivity rate was over 10%, indicating there was high transmission of the virus in the area.  33  34  35  35 Participant recruitment The lead author contacted instructors at that university who were teaching summer classes, requesting their help with gathering data. A number of these instructors consented to share the survey link with their students and gave extra credit to students who participated in the survey. The survey included measures for all variables in the proposed models, as well as demographic variables. Participants were instructed to review an online consent form and confirm their willingness to participate by selecting “I consent to participate” before starting the survey. Each participant earned extra credit based on their instructor’s criteria. Two screening questions unrelated to the study were embedded in the survey to assess response validity: (1) “Where is the capital of the USA located today?” and (2) “What language is mostly spoken in Mexico?” Each question included multiple-choice answers, with one clearly correct option. Participants who answered either question incorrectly were excluded from the analysis. In total, 12 participants were excluded based on these criteria. In total, 310 students provided valid responses, and they constituted the final sample used in the analyses. Power analysis A power analysis was conducted using the semPower package in R, which supports power analysis for structural equation models.  36  37 Measures The survey assessed worry about COVID-19, COVID-19 risk perception (perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 and perceived severity of contracting COVID-19), vaccine perception (perceived vaccine safety & perceived vaccine effectiveness), and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, along with demographic variables. The present study used a measure of “intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19” as a proxy for measuring COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The assessment items for all key variables were derived from peer-reviewed literature and subsequently adjusted to align with the context of COVID-19. 26 38 40 Table 1 Table 1.

After identifying the best-fitting model, bootstrapping procedures (2,000 resamples) were conducted to test the significance of each mediating path. Bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals were computed for each mediating path, and conclusions regarding statistical significance were drawn based on these intervals. Multiple fit indices were utilized to assess how well the proposed models matched the data. In structural equation models with either continuous or categorical outcomes, a CFI or TLI score above 0.90 reflects a good alignment between the model and the data.  41  41 The chi-square (χ²) statistic was also applied to compare models, as it remains the best test available for identifying issues within a model. 42 43  43 p  44 Results Sample characteristics Table 2 Table 2.

SEM analyses found that only Model (3) shows an excellent fit to the data. Results of Model (3) analyses found that perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 has a direct and negative, and perceived vaccine safety (the strongest predictor) has a direct and positive influence on vaccine acceptance. The impacts of perceived severity of contracting COVID-19 and perceived vaccine effectiveness on vaccine acceptance are non-significant. Worry about COVID-19 has a direct and indirect influence on vaccine acceptance; the indirect influence is mediated by perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 and perceived vaccine safety. Implications of the present study are discussed below. A counterintuitive finding of this study is that perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 has a negative influence on vaccine acceptance. In other words, college students who have higher perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 have lower vaccine acceptance. One possible reason for this finding is fatalistic beliefs.  47  48  47 Perceived severity of contracting COVID-19 was not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance in the present sample. One plausible explanation is the age composition of our participants, who were primarily young adults (mean age = 24.09). Research suggests that younger individuals often perceive themselves as less vulnerable and tend to underestimate the consequences of health-related threats, due to a sense of invincibility or optimism bias.  49  29 The finding that perceived vaccine safety has a direct and positive influence on vaccine acceptance, while perceived vaccine effectiveness had no significant impact, suggests that whether vaccines are safe is much more important than whether they are effective when college students weigh their decisions to accept vaccines or not. One possible explanation is that getting vaccinated is not like taking oral medications, an activity which only involves drinking/eating, which people are used to doing in their daily life; the fact that it requires an injection might make it feel more intrusive,  50  51 Another interesting finding is that effects of worry on vaccine acceptance are partially mediated by perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 and perceived vaccine safety. Although this finding is inconsistent with the risk-as-feelings hypothesis, which suggests that feelings mediate cognition, it is in line with Chen and Liu’s (2023)  52  53 Theoretical implications Our findings carry important theoretical implications. First, the result that worry about COVID-19 is a significant and direct predictor of vaccine acceptance underscores the role of feelings in health-related decision making. This aligns with the risk-as-feelings hypothesis, which posits that emotional reactions can directly influence behavior, particularly in contexts involving uncertainty or risk.  13 Second, the finding that worry indirectly affects vaccine acceptance through perceived probability and perceived vaccine safety suggests that, in the context of deliberate health decisions such as vaccine uptake, it’s more likely that feelings influence decision making through cognitive pathways, rather than that cognition influences decision making through feelings. This supports the central tenets of both the Health Belief Model (HBM)  15  16 Finally, these findings suggest that HBM and PMT offer more appropriate theoretical frameworks for understanding deliberate health behaviors than the risk-as-feelings hypothesis. In other words, while feelings do play a role, cognition appears to be the main driver of deliberate health-related decisions. Limitations This study has some limitations. First, all measures relied on self-reports, therefore, there is a possibility that social desirability may have biased the findings. Nevertheless, the survey questions in the current study were not intrusive, and “not applicable” options were included where appropriate, likely encouraging honest responses from most participants. Second, this study treated perceived probability and perceived severity as distinct and independent predictors. This approach aligns with much of the existing literature on COVID-19 vaccination behavior and intentions. 8 10  25  15 Third, it should be noted that the present sample reported relatively low levels of worry ( M Figure 3 Fourth, this study used a sample of college students, who are mostly younger adults. Compared to older adults or individuals with underlying health conditions, younger adults are less likely to experience severe symptoms—or may even remain asymptomatic—after contracting COVID-19.  29 Fifth, the current sample consisted of a notably high proportion of female participants (69.4%), which surpasses the national average of 58% female undergraduate students in the United States in 2021.  54 Conclusion Despite the limitations mentioned above, the present study represents the first attempt to test three competing models involving cognitions, feelings, and vaccine acceptance in the COVID-19 context. Findings suggest that higher perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 and lower perceived vaccine safety are related to lower vaccine acceptance. Worry about COVID-19 directly and indirectly influences vaccine acceptance, with indirect influences partially mediated by perceived probability of contracting COVID-19 and perceived vaccine safety. Findings contribute to public health research by demonstrating that cognitions, instead of worry, are the main drivers of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Moreover, this study contributes to public health practice by recommending that vaccine campaigns targeting college students focus on vaccine safety, utilize reasonable worry as an emotional cue, and refrain from excessive emphasis on the likelihood of contracting COVID-19. Future research may want to test the three competing models in other health/risk behaviors, including deliberate behaviors and spontaneous ones.
