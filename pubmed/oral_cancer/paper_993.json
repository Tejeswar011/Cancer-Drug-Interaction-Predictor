Introduction 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) is an NAPH-dependent oxidoreductase, which in humans is mainly expressed in the liver, adipose tissue, lungs, central nervous system (CNS), and ovaries [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 11 12 13 13 In light of recent reports on the role of 11β-HSD1 in the development of several types of cancer and the possibility of using 11β-HSD1 inhibitors in pharmacotherapy, the search for new compounds—selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitors—becomes interesting. Already-known 11β-HSD1 inhibitors ( Figure 1 14 15 16 17 H 18 H 19 H H 20 21 22 The aim of this study was, first, to design and synthesize new compounds containing the 2-(cyclohexylamino)thiazol-4(5 H H 23 H 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Chemistry In this work, all new 2-(cyclohexylamino)thiazol-4(5 H Figure 2 N H Section 3.2 Method A, similarly to previously conducted syntheses of pseudothiohydantoin derivatives [ 20 3a 3c 3a 3c 3d 3e 3d e 3d e H 3f 3i 3i 1 13 Table 1 2.2. 11β-HSD Inhibitory Activity The obtained compounds 3a 3i Table 2 H H 20 Moreover, overall, as a series of derivatives, they have so far shown the highest inhibitory activity among all 2-aminothiazol-4(5 H tert H 22 H 21 H 24 H 25 H 26 Among the tested compounds, the best inhibitory effect on 11β-HSD1 was demonstrated by derivative 3h 50 50 3i 50 3i 3h 3g 50 3g 3f Among the derivatives with branched aliphatic substituents, derivative 3d 50 3e 50 The highest activity among the unbranched derivatives was obtained for 2-(cyclohexylamino)-5-propylthiazol-4(5 H 3c 50 3b 50 3b 3a 50 However, tests for the inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 showed that all obtained derivatives of 2-(cyclohexylamino)thiazol-4(5 H 3i 3a Considering the obtained in vitro test results in terms of 11β-HSD1 inhibition potency and selectivity, compounds 3d 3g 3h 2.3. Results of the Docking Studies The binding energies from the docking simulations are shown in Figure 3 20 R S Figure 3 3g Figure 3 The order of theoretically determined binding energies accurately reflects the experimental IC 50 50 Figure 3 3h 3a 50 R p S p 3d 3i 3a 50 50 Given the satisfactory agreement between theoretical and experimental results, we conducted a more detailed analysis to identify the structural aspects of ligand-protein interactions. The summary below is based on analyzing ligand-protein contacts where the distance between any corresponding atom pair is smaller than an arbitrarily accepted value of 0.4 nm. All the studied ligands bind to the protein structure in a nearly identical manner (see Figure 3 26 19 Figure 3 Figure 3 3a 3e 3f 3i Figure 3 The detailed description of the protein-ligand contact pattern focuses on the most potent compound 3h Figure 3 The aliphatic cyclohexyl group present in all studied ligands maintains close contacts with the side chains of Tyr183 and Thr124. These interactions are primarily CH–π interactions and hydrophobic contacts involving only the non-polar parts of the Tyr and Thr sidechains. Similar non-polar interactions occur between the cyclohexyl rings and Val180, although these molecular fragments are slightly farther apart compared to the interactions with Tyr183 and Thr124. The proximity of the NADP + + + In summary, the primary driving force for binding appears to be the hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the non-polar cluster (Leu171, Leu217, Tyr177, and Tyr183), supported by hydrogen bonding with Ser170 and possibly NADP + 20 2.4. Metabolic Activity We observed significant changes in cell metabolic activity in a concentration-dependent manner. In detail, we noted that the metabolic activity of human fibroblast, human brain glioma, and human pancreatic cancer cells increased or remained unaffected except for compound 3f 3f 3g 3c 3f 3i Figure 4 3e 3f 3h 3a 3g 3i Figure 4 3a 3b 3e 3g 3h 3i 3b 3c 3g 3h 3i 3c 3d 3f 3g Figure 4 H H 20 20 21 22 27 The decrease in metabolic activity of the tested MDA-MB-231 and SK-MEL-30 cell lines observed for derivatives with cyclopentylamine and cyclohexylamine groups is at a similar level, and a significant reduction in cell viability is observed mainly at higher concentrations of the tested compounds, above 200 µM.

Evaluation of Intracellular Redox Homeostasis The levels of reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured for all experimental sets at a concentration of 500 µM/each. The highest increase in the level of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was noted for the SK-MEL-30, Caco-2, and MDA-MB-231 lines. These findings demonstrate that the tested compounds exert pro-oxidant activity, a mechanism considered therapeutically advantageous in anticancer strategies. The associated increase in ROS production in these cell lines is likely to compromise cellular homeostasis and trigger apoptotic pathways. In detail, we observed an increase in ROS production for compounds 3a 3b 3e 3i 3b 3e 3i 3e 3i 3h 3i Figure 5 In the case of RNS, we observed an increased level for the BJ line, with the exception of compounds 3a 3d 3f 3g 3a 3i 3g 3h 3b 3c 3g 3h 3a 3b 3f 3h Figure 5 3b 3a 3e Figure 5 3a 3i H 20 GSH is a critical intracellular antioxidant that plays a role in a primary defense mechanism by regulating cellular redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative and nitrosative stress caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The observed depletion of GSH is directly associated with the induction of pro-oxidant stress, as diminished GSH levels compromise the cellular antioxidant defense, thereby increasing the susceptibility of cancer cells to oxidative damage and impairing their capacity to detoxify ROS. This impairment represents a critical event in the initiation of cell death pathways and contributes to the antiproliferative activity of the tested compounds. As expected, glutathione activity increases in response to the presence of water-derived free radicals. Moreover, elevated intracellular GSH levels in cancer cells have been correlated with tumor progression and the development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Similar to the cyclopentylamino derivatives, the strongest GSH reduction was observed for the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Replacing the cyclopentylamino group with the cyclohexylamino group resulted in a significant reduction in GSH levels. Our results provide evidence that cyclohexylamino derivatives exhibit enhanced pro-oxidant activity compared to their cyclopentylamino analogs, with the MDA-MB-231 cell line showing the greatest sensitivity to this effect, while for cyclopentylamino derivatives, the most significant reduction was observed for compounds 3f 3i 3g 20 2.6. Predicting Medicinal Chemistry Structural Alerts In the early stages of drug discovery, a key step is to identify compounds that meet the parameters of medicinal chemistry. This study assessed pseudothiohydantoin derivatives for potential interferences in the assay using the PAINS (Pan-assay interference compounds) test and the Brenk alert. Compounds that interfere with the pan-assay test are structures that interfere with biological assays by giving false positive results [ 28 29 30 3a 3i Supplementary Information Table S1 3.

Conclusions In the presented study, nine new derivatives of 2-(cyclohexylamino)thiazol-4-(5 H 3a 3i 50 In the case of antitumor activity studies, the results indicate that most of the tested compounds do not inhibit the viability of pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) or glioma (U-118) cells and show only limited activity against breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), melanoma (SK-MEL-30), and human colon adenoma (Caco-2) cells. Interestingly, activity against MDA-MB-231, SK-MEL-30, and Caco-2 cell lines is observed only at relatively high concentrations of 200 µM.
