Gallbladder cancer is the most common biliary tract malignancy, primarily affects older women and strongly associated with cholelithiasis. Early detection is critical, as prognosis worsens significantly with disease progression. This case involves a 68-year-old male, who presented with abdominal pain, jaundice, and cachexia. Imaging initially revealed a stage I gallbladder cancer with associated cholelithiasis. Despite recommendations for prompt surgical, histopathological and oncological referral, patient’s socioeconomic barriers delayed intervention. Within 4 months, the cancer progressed to stage IV, with direct invasion of the liver and duodenum, vascular thrombosis, and metastatic lymphadenopathy, ultimately leading to the patient's death. This case highlights the devastating impact of delayed care for gallbladder cancer, underscoring the need for improved access to early diagnosis, timely referrals, strengthening specialized medical services at regional level and coordinated multidisciplinary management of aggressive malignancies.

Despite this, GBC is relatively rare, with a global incidence reaching up to 27 cases per 100,000 individuals. The highest rates are observed in South America and Asia, while Africa is considered a low-risk region. The disease predominantly affects individuals over 50 years of age, and women are up to 4 times more likely to develop it than men [ [1] [2] [3] [4] The most significant risk factor for gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is cholelithiasis as up to 95% of cases are associated with gallstones. Other contributing risk factors include chronic cholecystitis, gallbladder adenomatous polyps, porcelain gallbladder, obesity or overweight, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus (DM). Additionally, a family history of GBC, multiparity, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and chronic bacterial infections (such as Salmonella or Helicobacter species) may increase susceptibility to the disease [ 1 3 5 Ultrasound is typically the first-line imaging modality for suspected gallbladder cancer. Cross-sectional abdominal imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offers higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting GBC and provides detailed assessment of local tumor extent and staging. For ambiguous lesions, nuclear imaging studies play a crucial role in identifying residual disease after treatment and detecting distant metastases that may not be visible on conventional imaging [ 1 [6] [7] [8] GBC is staged using the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification system, established by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The T stage indicates the depth of tumor invasion through the gallbladder wall and into nearby structures, while N stage reflects regional lymph node involvement, and M stage denotes distant metastasis. T1 and T2 tumors are limited to the gallbladder wall, whereas T3 and T4 tumors extend beyond it [ 9 10 Surgical resection remains the most effective and only potentially curative treatment for GBC. Early-stage (T1) tumors can often be cured with radical cholecystectomy, while T2 and T3 tumors may still be resectable but typically require en bloc removal of adjacent organs and regional lymphadenectomy. In contrast, T4 (advanced-stage) tumors are generally considered unresectable [ 9 11 12 13 Patients with stage I GBC have an excellent prognosis, demonstrating a 5-year disease-specific survival rate approaching 100% following simple cholecystectomy. For stage II tumors, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 40% with cholecystectomy alone, but improves significantly to 90% with radical resection (including lymph node dissection and adjacent organ resection when indicated). Stage III tumors show intermediate outcomes, with a 5-year survival rate of 44% following aggressive surgical intervention. In contrast, stage IV, unresectable disease carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of just 2-8 months. Overall, untreated cases demonstrate poor cumulative median survival of 5-8 months and a 5-year survival rate of only 4% [ 1 2 11 14 This case report underscores the radiologically aggressive nature and rapid progression of GBC from stage I to stage IV within 4-months, emphasizing the critical importance of early detection and timely intervention. Whether discovered incidentally or through symptomatic presentation, early-stage GBC must be promptly treated with stage-appropriate therapy to optimize outcomes. Case presentation Clinical history A 68-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), essential hypertension, and peptic ulcer disease was referred to us from a primary health facility for further evaluation. His primary complaint was chronic abdominal pain. An initial abdominal ultrasound revealed a nonspecific gallbladder lesion, prompting referral for dedicated abdominal and pelvic CT imaging to better characterize the gallbladder abnormality. Imaging findings Contrast-enhanced abdominal-pelvic CT imaging revealed a circumferential, lobulated, enhancing soft tissue mass confined to the gallbladder lumen ( Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 1 CT-Scan abdomen, soft tissue windows at the level of gallbladder. (A) axial, (B) coronal, both noncontrasted. (C) axial and (D) coronal, both post oral and intravenous contrast administration. The study demonstrates a 4.8mm dependent gallbladder calculus (yellow arrows), associated with adjacent irregular enhancing wall thickening, suggestive of localized inflammatory changes. A circumferential, lobulated, heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass (measuring 2.4cm×1.7cm) is noted to be confined in the wall of the gallbladder body, causing luminal narrowing (white arrows). No pathologically enlarged regional or para-aortic lymph nodes are identified. Incidental note is made of abdominal aorta multifocal atherosclerotic plaques. Fig 1 – Fig. 2 CT-Scan abdomen and pelvis, soft tissue windows, post oral and intravenous contrast administration. Image (A) axial at the level of bifunction of the main portal vein. (B) coronal at the level of the portal hepatis. (C) axial, at the level of gallbladder and the pancreas and (D) coronal at the level of kidneys. (A), (B) and (C) demonstrate mild to moderate dilation of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary system, involving the right and left hepatic ducts (red arrows), common hepatic duct (yellow arrow), cystic duct (blue arrow), and common bile duct (white arrows). The gallbladder tumor is also seen (stars), without evidence of infiltration into adjacent tissues or organs. Additionally, (D) multiple bilateral thin-walled cortical renal cysts (Bosniak I/II) are noted, the largest measuring 2.5cm in the right lower pole. Fig 2 Initial diagnosis and recommendations Based on imaging findings, the working diagnosis was stage I gallbladder carcinoma (T1bN0M0 per TNM staging) with concurrent cholelithiasis and localized cholecystitis. The patient was scheduled for histopathological confirmation via surgical specimen analysis. Given the potential malignancy, urgent referral to a national tertiary hospital was recommended for comprehensive staging and multidisciplinary management. Follow-up (4-months later) Clinical presentation: The patient was alert but appeared cachectic and ill, with icteric sclerae but no cyanosis. Bilateral pitting edema was noted in the lower extremities. Vital signs during hospitalization included hypertension (BP range: 147/83-158/92 mmHg), tachycardia (HR: 98-112 bpm), and elevated random blood glucose levels (8.4-18.1 mmol/L). Abdominal examination revealed a normal contour with tenderness localized to the right upper quadrant, though no discrete mass was palpable. Imaging findings: Fig. 3 Fig. 3 CT-Scan abdomen, soft tissue windows. (A) axial, noncontrasted. (B) axial, (C) coronal, (D) axial, (E) saggital and (F) coronal all are post intravenous contrast administration. A large (12.8×11.4×11.3cm) ill-defined, heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass (stars) with extensive necrotic/cystic degeneration, arising from the gallbladder, causing marked luminal narrowing and exhibiting aggressive local invasion into liver segments I, IVb, V, and VI, as well as the first and second portions of the duodenal wall (yellow arrows). The mass compresses the hepatic/suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC), resulting in extensive bland thrombosis extending into the infrahepatic IVC and bilateral common iliac veins (white arrows). Additional findings include portal vein dilation (1.8cm diameter) without thrombosis, along with numerous metastatic regional and para-aortic lymph nodes (blue arrows). Fig 3 Laboratory investigations: Final diagnoses Management: Discussion Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract with large majority are adenocarcinomas. Incidence rises with advancing age, typically affecting individuals over 50 years, and demonstrates a marked female predominance, with women affected up to 4 times more often than men [ 1 3 Cholelithiasis is the most significant risk factor for GBC, with gallstones found in up to 95% of cases. The risk of developing gallbladder cancer is about ten times higher in patients with gallstones larger than 3cm [ 1 5 In addition to cholelithiasis, several other risk factors have been associated with an increased likelihood of developing GBC [ 3 5 H. pylori 4 The commonest early-stage symptom presentation for GBC is abdominal pain or biliary colic. Patients with advanced disease may also present with jaundice, from direct invasion and obstruction of the biliary tree. Other systemic symptoms, such as fatigue, malaise and weight loss, may also be present [ 1 15 The diagnostic workup began with a transabdominal ultrasound performed in response to the initial patient's abdominal pain, which revealed nonspecific gallbladder abnormalities. Subsequent evaluation with abdominal CT identified a tumor confined within the gallbladder wall, suggested to represent stage I GBC - T1bN0M0, TNM staging [ 9 7 8 Suspected stage I GBC are often curable with prompt surgical intervention (radical cholecystectomy) [ 11 14 1 4 Due to socioeconomic barriers, the patient was unable to pursue the referral promptly. Within just 4 months, the disease progressed rapidly to stage IV, as confirmed by a follow-up abdominal CT scan. The tumor had directly invaded the liver and duodenum, with multiple regional lymphadenopathies, consistent with T4N2M0 - TNM staging [ 9 2 11 Prompt management of GBC is critical, particularly when the disease is detected at an early stage. Early intervention could have significantly improved outcomes for this patient, as stage I GBC has a disease-specific survival rate of up to 100% at 5 years following simple cholecystectomy. By the time the disease progressed to stage IV, the prognosis became exceedingly poor, as with an overall survival time of just 2-8 months and a 5-year survival rate of only 4% [ 2 11 14 Conclusion and learning points Gallbladder cancer is an aggressive and rapid progressive malignancy and should be considered in older adults, regardless of sex, especially with risk factors such as gallstones, chronic/recurrent cholecystitis, diabetes mellitus and H.
