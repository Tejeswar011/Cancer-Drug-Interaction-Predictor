Dysregulation of AGC2 is implicated in rare genetic diseases and tumorigenesis, making it a promising therapeutic target. Methods In this study, we developed the first integrative platform for the discovery and validation of high-affinity AGC2 modulators, combining in silico screening with biophysical and functional assays. Docking-based virtual screening of chemical libraries was employed to identify candidate inhibitors. Their binding and inhibitory activity were validated via a combination of thermal shift assays and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) performed on n d Results We identified two previously unreported AGC2 inhibitors, suramin and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate. Remarkably, we report the first successful application of ITC to AGC2, overcoming major experimental challenges associated with ITC assays on the SLC25A family members, and achieving greater stability and reproducibility compared to similar assays performed on other family members, such as the ADP/ATP carrier and uncoupling proteins. Additionally, we present the first transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization of proteoliposomes and DDM-based vesicles reconstituted with AGC2, providing direct structural insights into the systems used for biophysical analysis. Conclusions This study establishes a reproducible, and scalable workflow that bridges high-throughput ligand identification with high-resolution kinetic characterization for targeting mitochondrial carriers.

Their function relies on the transport of solutes across the inner mitochondrial membrane, a process mediated by the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) members. This family comprises 53 members in humans, characterized by a conserved tripartite structure of three tandem repeats, each containing two transmembrane α-helices, resulting in six transmembrane helices (H1-H6) [ 1 3 4 5 1 4 5 S1 1 3 S1 1 4 5 S1 It is believed that the prolines and glycines in the PG levels are responsible for the main conformational changes enabling substrate translocation, as the tilt and kink movements of the transmembrane helices of mitochondrial carriers are hinged on these conserved Pro and Gly residues. Prolines in the sequence motifs of odd-numbered helices (H1, H3, and H5) induce kinks that enable the formation of the matrix gate. This gate is stabilized by inter-helix ionic pairs formed between charged residues of the sequence motifs on the odd transmembrane helices [ 1 4 5 S1 1 4 5 S1 The transport mechanism elucidated for the majority of the characterized mitochondrial carriers follows a “ping-pong” model, alternating between the c-state and the m-state via an intermediate state that is partially closed to both the intermembrane space and the mitochondrial matrix [ 1 2 4 6 Among mitochondrial carriers, the Aspartate/Glutamate Carrier paralogs AGC1 and AGC2 are vital for the exchange of aspartate and glutamate, supporting the malate-aspartate shuttle and other essential metabolic processes [ 7 9 NP_003696.2 NP_055066.1 7 7 8 10 SLC25A13 7 8 SLC25A12 7 9 7 Despite AGC2’s critical role, structural and functional characterization remains incomplete due to challenges in studying membrane proteins [ 1 2 4 6 7 11 12 11 12 In this study, for the first time we employ TSA and ITC to investigate AGC2-ligand interactions, and compare the obtained results with those coming from traditional transport assays [ 7 n d 13 14 Results Bacterial expression, purification and reconstitution of the human AGC2 The AGC2 protein (AC: NM_014251.3 NP_055066.1 E. coli S2 1 S3 1 1 S4 S2 Fig. 1 Bacterial expression and purification of AGC2 inclusion bodies.

Panel A N N B C-F C D E F In order to shed light on possible new modulators of AGC2 transport activity catalyzed by the recombinant AGC2, we firstly defined a binding region to be explored through docking-based virtual screening of an in-house developed chemical library. Then, we performed docking experiments using aspartate as ligand, before running the virtual screening of our chemical library. A gridbox involving residues of the predicted binding region between the PG-level 1 and the PGlevel 2 [ 18 19 6 Then, by using the defined gridbox, we performed the virtual screening of our in-house developed chemical library. The list sorted by energy of the 9669 successfully screened ligands is available upon request. Notably, suramin, whose ability in inhibiting AGC1 was previously verified [ 13 6 7 6 7 21 7 Fig. 7 Free energy of binding (LE_LC, expressed in kcal/mol) calculated by autodock for the selected 3 molecules. The LE_LC (namely the energy of the Lowest Energy conformation in the Largest Cluster identified along autodock runs) for the docking of L-aspartate in SLC25A13_AGC2 is shown in green characters. Free energy of binding together with ligand efficiency, number of heavy atoms (hydrogens are excluded from this count) and number of torsions are reported for each investigated molecule. 2D structures of the assayed ligands are also shown Kinetic characteristics of the human recombinant AGC2 Our results about substrate specificity are consistent with previously reported data about the human AGC2 confirming the known AGC2 substrate preferences [ 7 22 The Michaelis–Menten (half-saturation) constant (K m 14 50 8 Fig. 8 Inhibition of the rate of [ 14 14 Thermostability assays To assess the stability and folding state of AGC2 following its reconstitution, thermostability data were collected using the thiol-reactive fluorescent dye N E. coli n d Specifically, we evaluated the binding affinity for the three modulators/ligands/inhibitor (suramin, taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate and mersalyl) that gave the best result from the virtual screening previously carried out (Fig. 9 9 9 B Fig. 9 Inhibitor/substrate-carrier interactions induce specific thermostability shifts with DDM-AGC2 vesicles.

The results also highlight the importance to balance potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profiles in developing therapeutics targeting mitochondrial carriers. Indeed, while radiolabeled transport assays although limited by the availability of radiolabelled substrates and their suitability for high-throughput applications, remain crucial for evaluating functional activity in near-native environments, the integration of docking-based virtual screening of chemical libraries, thermal shift assays (TSA) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) addresses these limitations, enabling the rapid identification of promising candidates, and providing scalable and precise validation platforms for identifying candidate ligands and elucidating their thermodynamic binding parameters. Docking simulations, in particular, serve as a powerful filtering tool to prioritize molecules predicted to have high binding affinity, significantly streamlining the experimental phase. By narrowing down vast chemical libraries to a manageable number of candidates, docking analysis reduces the need for exhaustive high-throughput in vitro screening, a process that would otherwise require years of labor-intensive work. However, it is important to emphasize that docking scores and predicted binding affinities (such as Ki or ΔG) should not be interpreted as absolute values. Discrepancies between computational predictions and experimental results often arise from the inherent variability in ligand properties, such as molecular size, shape, flexibility, and selectivity, as well as limitations in the docking environment, which typically involves rigid receptor models and simplified, solvent-free (in vacuo) conditions. These factors highlight the necessity of experimental validation to accurately assess ligand behavior under physiologically relevant conditions. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for rational drug design, emphasizing the need to balance potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profiles in developing therapeutics targeting mitochondrial carriers. In the present study, the recombinant AGC2 protein was expressed in E. coli Transport assays provided essential functional data but are technically challenging, as they rely on substrates that are often unavailable in radiolabeled forms or prohibitively expensive, limiting their applicability in large-scale studies. By contrast, TSA proved to be a practical and alternative high-throughput screening, leveraging specific substrate-protein interactions that induced stabilization or destabilization of AGC2, leading to measurable changes in the thermal shift (ΔT m m It should be noted that the possibility of using thermostability assays to check the stability of the ligand-bound form relative to the unbound form, looking at the shift in the apparent melting curve of a membrane protein sample, and ITC for determining K D 23 25 26 In our case study, thermal shift assays highlighted distinct stabilization effects induced by the candidate molecules, supporting their specific interactions with AGC2. Among the tested molecules, mersalyl showed the highest ΔT m 7 1 D D These results underscore the complementarity of TSA and ITC in evaluating protein–ligand interactions. While TSA offers a rapid screening platform, ITC provides precise thermodynamic parameters, including binding stoichiometry, enthalpy (ΔH), and entropy (ΔS). The results from ITC on molecules selected in silico by virtual screening and in vitro by TSA, are consistent with transport assays, validating the use of TSA as a reliable high-throughput method for identifying AGC2 modulators. Conversely, both the TSA and ITC based approaches do not discriminate at the moment between translocated substrates or stabilizing inhibitors or activators, highlighting the need for further analysis to clarify their respective capacities in this regard. Remarkably, a targeted set of radiolabeled transport assays can still be employed to assess the abilities of selected molecules to modulate transport activity, while competitive ITC assays will be developed to extract kinetic parameters that may offer insights into transport versus binding-only behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first successful application of an integrated docking-TSA–ITC workflow combined with transport assays for the investigation of AGC. Although similar strategies have been sporadically applied to other SLC25A transporters. such as AAC and UCP, with debated results about poor reproducibility, our approach yields robust and reproducible data, underscoring its potential as a reliable platform for characterizing AGC (SLC25A members) modulators. TEM analysis, uniformity and unicompartment vesicles The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of PL-AGC2 and DDM-AGC2-based vesicles (Amb-AGC2 and FPLC-AGC2) revealed a population of frequent smaller spherical vesicles (diameter of 25–50 nm), containing one or two protein units, with exceptional larger vesicles (150–200 nm) often hosting more than three protein units. This heterogeneity is not unique to AGC2 but has been observed in other studies on membrane transporters, such as proteoliposomes used to study channel proteins and transporters under buffer gradients [ 27 28 In addition, the coherence between binding affinity estimated through ITC on FPLC-AGC2 vesicles and transport assays on PL-AGC2 preparations (according to [ 7 27 29 32 Oligomerization and functional implications The presence of both monomeric and dimeric protein-vesicles observed by TEM (Figure S7 and Figure S9) is consistent with previous findings [ 33 33 E. coli 34 33 34 35 34 36 17 34 37 Structure–property relationships of the investigated ligands within AGC2 and other SLC25A transporters Larger ligands (like carboxyatractyloside or suramin in the AAC, or suramin and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate in AGC2) tend to penetrate less deeply into the substrate-binding cavity of mitochondrial carriers compared to smaller molecules (like aspartate or mersalyl in AGC2). However, the investigated larger molecules are able to establish interactions with residues close both to the matrix gate and to the cytosolic gate, in contrast to smaller ligands, which tend to interact mainly with residues located between the contact points of the similarly located substrate-binding site of mitochondrial carriers and the matrix gate, when mitochondrial carriers are in the cytosolic conformation. More in detail, beyond the interactions formed between all the investigated ligands and the residues of the substrate-binding site or the residues of the m-gate, the sulfate group of carboxyatractyloside, the sulfate and sulfonate groups of taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate, and the sulfonate groups of suramin can form electrostatic interactions with basic residues situated between the contact points of the substrate-binding site and the cytosolic gate (see interactions between the crystallized carboxyatractyloside or the docked suramin and residues K91 and R187 within AAC2, or see interactions between the docked suramin and taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate and residues K405 and K408 in AGC2; Figure S1 1 4 6 Concerning mersalyl, a small organomercurial inhibitor, it also interacts with residues located between the AGC2 binding site and its matrix gate, similarly to what is observed with the substrate aspartate, enabling efficient inhibition with an IC₅₀ in the submicromolar concentration range. In addition to its inhibitory potency, mersalyl caused pronounced destabilization of AGC2, as evidenced by a marked decrease in thermal stability and significant quenching of the fluorescence signal in our assays. These effects likely reflect extensive ligand–protein interactions that destabilize the conformational integrity of the carrier, most likely due to the presence of Hg 2 2 38 39 40 43 2 Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics considerations about the investigated small molecules Mersalyl, a thiol-reactive organomercury compound, likely interacts with cysteine residues near the substrate-binding site, stabilizing AGC2 in a specific conformation. This observation aligns with studies demonstrating that SH-reagents, like mersalyl, significantly alter AGC2 transport activity [ 44 45 Remarkably, mersalyl was historically used as a diuretic [ 46 47 48 49 Notably, suramin, with its polyanionic structure, interacts with positively charged residues in the AGC2 binding cavity, mimicking endogenous substrates such as aspartate. Suramin has a long history of use in treating neglected tropical diseases, such as African trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis [ 50 50 51 Pharmacokinetic studies reveal that suramin has a remarkably long plasma half-life, ranging from 41 to 78 days, depending on the dosage and patient variability [ 51 50 13 13 52 54 13 55 Taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate is observed to contain a cis-decalinic moiety, a sulfate group at the 3-position of lithocholic acid, and a sulfonic group as part of its taurine moiety [ 56 7 13 16 57 13 1 2 4 Remarkably, taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate is a bile salt derivative with amphiphilic properties that influence its pharmacokinetics. It is typically metabolized via enterohepatic circulation, with the liver playing a central role in its processing and recycling. Taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate sulfonate group enhances its solubility and might facilitate intravenous administration [ 58 While specific pharmacokinetic data related to the possible administration of taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate are limited, studies on related bile salts suggest a plasma half-life lower than 30 min, depending on species and experimental conditions [ 59 60 D Conclusion remarks The presented pipeline is not only robust for investigating AGC2 but also adaptable for other mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) members, starting from AGC1. The structural and functional similarities between AGC1 and AGC2 (82% of identical residues comparing their full-length sequences, and more than 96% of identical residues facing the substrate translocation cavities of the two carriers) highlight the potential for a unified strategy in the identification of new modulators of both AGC1 and AGC2. Both paralogs play pivotal roles in mitochondrial metabolism: AGC2 supports the malate-aspartate shuttle, while AGC1 is essential for brain energy metabolism and myelination processes. Dysregulation of each paralog contributes to metabolic disorders and neurological diseases, underscoring their therapeutic relevance. Several avenues for future research emerge from this work. First, TEM analysis provides valuable insights into the structural and functional organization of AGC2 vesicles, revealing systems consisting mainly of 40–50 nm vesicles, containining one or two monomers, and exceptionally 150–200 nm vesicles containing several protein monomers , similarly to what observed with other well-studied membrane transporters [ 38 D m D 16 18 61 7 9 Materials and methods Expression and purification of the human recombinant AGC2 protein The wild-type AGC2 mRNA sequence ( NM_014251.3 E. coli XL-1 blue d E. coli 13 13 62 13 S3 Solubilization and reconstitution of AGC2 into liposomes The AGC2 recombinant protein was solubilized in 8% sarkosyl ( N 13 63 65 13 63 65 l S2 Transport measurements in AGC2 proteoliposomes The obtained AGC2 proteoliposomes (PL-AGC2) were subsequently eluted on Sephadex G-75 columns pre-equilibrated with 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM PIPES–NaOH at pH 6.5 (buffer A) to remove the external substrate not entered in the proteolipsomes. Thus, the eluted proteoliposomes were distributed in reaction vessels, then a control transport assay was started at 25 °C by adding externally [ 14 Solubilization and reconstitution of the recombinant AGC2 protein in DDM-based vesicles The AGC2 protein was first solubilized in buffer A containing 0.8% sarkosyl ( N n d sn sn S2 Size exclusion chromatography for detergent removal in AGC2 reconstituted in DDM based vesicles The excess of sarkosyl was removed from the solubilized protein mixture by repeated passage (10–15 times) over Amberlite XAD-4 resin until the disappearance of foam, indicating effective detergent removal (according to [ 13 63 65 S2 66 1 S3 S2 Transmission electron microscopy In order to identify the localizations of AGC2 monomers, samples of empty liposome (LPs), AGC2 proteoliposomes (PL-AGC2), AGC2 reconstituted DDM-based vesicles (DDM-AGC2), after purification of DDM-AGC2 on amberlite (Amb-AGC2), and DDM-AGC2 after FPLC purification (FPLC-AGC2), were processed for immunogold labelling. Essentially carbonated grids were floated for a few minutes on a drop of diluted suspensions of liposomes, twice rinsed on 0.05 M phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20 (PBST) for 5 min each and incubated for 30 min on a drop of primary antibodies to SLC25A13 raised in rabbit (Recombinant Human Calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier protein Citrin/AGC2, Immunogen residues 1–300, CSB-PA892444ESR2HU, Cusabio Technology LLC Houston USA) diluted 1: 20 with PBST. After floating twice on drop of PBST for 5 min each, the grids were exposed for 15 min to a preparation of colloidal gold 5 nm in diameter conjugated with anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Anti-Rabbit IgG—Gold antibody produced in goat, G7277, Sigma Aldrich- Merck KGaA, Germany) diluted 1: 100 with PBST. Grids were rinsed twice with PBS and twice with glass-distilled water for 5 min each before negative staining by 1% w/v uranyl acetate solution-UA ZERO (AGR1000—UA-Zero® EM Stain, Agar Scientific Ltd Essex UK). After draining off the excess of staining solution by means of a filter paper, the samples were transferred to the electron microscope for examination, using a Philips Morgagni 282D transmission electron microscope, operating at 80 kV. Electron micrographs of negatively stained samples were photographed on Kodak electron microscope film 4489 (kodak Company, New York, USA). For controls, one batch of the same samples was processed without the primary antibodies step and another without negative staining. Dataset from micrographs ImageJ (Rasband, W.S) software was used to extrapolate the measurements from TEM images. The straight-line tool was used to calculate the liposome/vesicle diameter as the average of 8 orthogonal measurements across the vesicle, and to determine the monomer–monomer distance. Excel software (Microsoft Excel-2021) was used to calculate the mean. 3D Comparative modeling Structure determination of membrane proteins has proven to be far from trivial [ 67 36 16 17 18 19 1 5 13 14 20 34 68 1 Virtual screening of a chemical library The chemical library used for our docking-based virtual screening was created by taking all the ligands greater than 10 atoms and lighter than 1200 g/mol from the KEGG ligand database and other molecules from KEGG drugs databas, as previously described [ 13 52 69 13 13 N l N l 7 http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page Before proceeding with the docking runs, the AGC2 3D model was prepared for the docking simulation by converting the AGC2 “. pdb” file in a “.pdbqt” file by using the MGLTools of Autodock4.2. The “.pdbqt” file contained gasteiger charges for every atom present in the original AGC2 “.pdb” file. Similarly, all the ligands (.mol2″ files) contained in our chemical library (energetically minimized) were converted in “.pdbqt” files for the virtual screening by using the Autodock scripts. In order to identify the ideal gridbox to be screened with ligands of our library, searching for new putative AGC2 high affinity ligands, firstly we performed single-docking simulations with aspartate, one of the preferred AGC2 substrates, by using Autodock 4.2, starting from the gridbox defined for investigating the ADP/ATP carrier interactions with its inhibitors [ 13 1 4 Inhibition (IC 50 Transport measurements were performed on PL-AGC2 in presence of different concentrations of the investigated inhibitors, added simultaneously with the radiolabeled substrates.

As described above, excess detergent was removed using Amberlite treatment followed by size exclusion chromatography. To ensure that any residual detergent did not interfere with the calorimetric assays, control ITC experiments were performed using only the reconstitution buffer without protein (i.e., empty vesicles, also observed in TEM assays). These controls showed no interfering heat signals, confirming that any remaining detergent did not significantly affect the measurements. Additionally, any minor background signals were subtracted during baseline correction to ensure accurate interpretation of protein–ligand interaction data.
