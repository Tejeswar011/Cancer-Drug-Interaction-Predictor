Methods This retrospective cohort study queried the 2005 to 2021 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program databases. Reconstructive cases performed by otolaryngologists (CPT: 15756, 15757, 15758, 15842, 20955, 20956, 20957, 20962, 20969, 20970, 20972, 20973, 43116, 43496, 49006, and 49906) with available age values and preoperative laboratory data were included. Liver disease severity was assessed using the AST‐to‐platelet ratio index (APRI), a marker of liver fibrosis, and the Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease‐Sodium (MELD‐Na), which predicts mortality. Mild liver disease (MLD) was classified as an APRI score ≥ 0.7 and a MELD‐Na score < 10. Advanced liver disease (ALD) was defined as an APRI score ≥ 0.7 and a MELD‐Na score ≥ 10. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were performed. Results A total of 5459 cases met the inclusion criteria, of which 93 (1.7%) had mild liver disease, and 105 (1.9%) had advanced liver disease. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression showed that ALD was associated with a significantly higher risk of postoperative complications (OR = 1.62, p p p Conclusion ALD is correlated with increased postoperative complication risks in MFTT surgeries. This study suggests that preoperative liver function assessment and optimization may mitigate surgical risks. Level of Evidence 3. While liver disease is known to affect surgical outcomes, its impact on head and neck microvascular free tissue transfer surgeries remains unexamined. This study uses the NSQIP national database to analyze the relationship between liver disease severity, determined by APRI and MELD‐Na scores, and postoperative complications. Our findings highlight specific risks associated with advanced liver disease, suggesting that targeted preoperative management strategies may benefit these high‐risk patients. free flap head and neck reconstruction liver disease microvascular surgery surgical outcomes pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  A.

The leading causes of mortality from liver disease include complications from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhosis is primarily caused by viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease [ 1 Advanced liver disease (ALD) severely impacts postoperative outcomes by impairing the synthesis of clotting factors and albumin, increasing the risk of bleeding and poor wound healing [ 2 3 4 5 6 Although liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing liver disease, its invasiveness necessitates alternative methods. Thus, multiple metrics have been developed to noninvasively assess liver disease severity and surgical risk. The AST‐to‐platelet ratio index (APRI) noninvasively measures liver fibrosis, with a threshold of ≥ 0.7 showing 77% sensitivity and 72% specificity [ 7 8 9 7 9 This study aims to investigate the relationship between liver disease, as determined by APRI and MELD‐Na scores, and the outcomes of head and neck MFTT surgeries. Elucidating these relationships may provide evidence‐based guidance for the preoperative assessment and management of patients with liver disease undergoing these surgeries. 2 Methods The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for head and neck free flap patients from 2005 to 2021. This national database includes over 150 variables from more than 650 hospitals, maintained by certified surgical clinical reviewers of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) [ 10 11 12 The ACS‐NSQIP Data Dictionary provides definitions for all preoperative and postoperative variables [ 11 9 7 7 9 Differences between the cohorts with no liver disease (NLD), MLD, and ALD were assessed using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for all continuous variables. Pearson's chi‐square test was used to assess the association between liver disease severity and categorical variables, with Fisher's exact test applied when cell counts were less than five. Primary outcomes included 30‐day postoperative variables: return to the operating room (OR), readmission, and complication rates. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with liver disease severity. All analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2, and a p 3 Results 3.1 Preoperative Analysis A total of 5459 patient records met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed from the NSQIP database. Of these, 93 (1.7%) patients had MLD and 105 (1.9%) had ALD, while 5261 (96.4%) patients had NLD. The MLD cohort was younger (60.8, 56.5, and 60.9 years for NLD, MLD, and ALD, respectively; p p p p p p p 1 TABLE 1 Comparing patient characteristics for those with no, mild, and advanced liver disease.

Callander et al. studied the impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on free tissue transfer outcomes, finding no significant association between HCV status and postoperative complications or length of stay [ 13 7 14 4.1 Return to OR In an adjusted model, ALD was significantly associated with a higher risk of unplanned return to the OR and reoperation for head and neck MFTT patients. This finding is consistent with a previous study which found a significant association between ALD and reoperation in head and neck surgeries [ 7 Interestingly, our study observed no significant relationship between ALD and 30‐day postoperative readmission. Previous studies have not specifically characterized the relationship between liver disease and readmission of head and neck reconstruction patients. This is unexpected given that patients with severe comorbidities typically have higher readmission rates. For example, surgical site infections (SSI) have been found to predict readmission [ 15 16 4.2 Complications Our study demonstrated that ALD patients experienced significantly more medical complications, such as pneumonia, unplanned intubation, prolonged use of ventilator (> 48 h), systemic sepsis, and acute renal failure. Although the difference in the occurrence of surgical complications overall was nonsignificant, the occurrence of a superficial SSI and bleeding requiring transfusions was both significantly elevated. The increased incidence of medical complications can be attributed to the immunocompromised state of patients with liver disease. Cirrhosis impairs the immune response due to defects in the innate immune system, including neutrophil burst, phagocytosis, and opsonization, and the presence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome‐like state. Bacterial translocation from the gut to systemic circulation, due to increased intestinal permeability and bacterial overgrowth, further exacerbates the risk of systemic infections. Pneumonia and sepsis, which were significantly higher in ALD patients, likely, contribute to the higher rates of intubation and ventilation, as these conditions can lead to respiratory failure. This aligns with the findings of Bajaj et al., who reported that infections in end‐stage liver disease are associated with high mortality and often require intensive care due to severe sepsis and septic shock [ 17 Our study demonstrated that ALD patients had a 3.8× greater risk of unplanned intubation compared to NLD patients. This underscores the consideration for one to lower the threshold for elective temporary tracheostomy in patients with liver disease who are undergoing complex head and neck surgeries, particularly in reconstructions such as oral cavity where the airway risk is greater at baseline. Previous research has shown that elective tracheostomy can significantly reduce postoperative ventilation time and the incidence of hospital‐acquired pneumonia, highlighting its potential benefits for optimizing respiratory outcomes in high‐risk surgical populations [ 18 19 20 Previous studies have highlighted the increased risk of postoperative complications in patients with liver disease. For instance, our findings were mostly consistent with a prior NSQIP study which characterized the increased morbidity caused by liver disease in all head and neck surgeries [ 7 7 14 The connection between ALD and complications in head and neck MFTT surgeries has not been well documented until now. This study highlights specific complications to improve preoperative evaluation, perioperative management, and patient counseling, aiming to reduce complication rates and enhance outcomes for this high‐risk population. 4.3 Managing Liver Disease This study highlights the association between ALD and postoperative complications in head and neck microvascular reconstruction, echoing findings from other head and neck surgical studies and from other surgical specialties. While optimizing liver function preoperatively remains challenging, evidence supports the role of comprehensive medical management of the complications of ALD, including coagulopathy, immune dysregulation, and hypoalbuminemia to improve surgical outcomes. Correcting coagulopathies in cirrhotic patients preoperatively remains controversial. Vitamin K administration (10 mg per day for 3 days) is sometimes recommended, but its efficacy in cirrhotic patients is unclear [ 21 22 23 23 24 Patients with cirrhosis also suffer from immune dysregulation, which increases the risk of infection following surgery. Those on chronic antibiotics for conditions like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis can continue these medications perioperatively. However, additional prophylactic antibiotics beyond routine intraoperative use are not currently supported [ 24 Nutritional support plays a critical role in managing patients with liver disease. Multiple studies have demonstrated that preoperative total parenteral nutrition in patients with hypoalbuminemia can significantly reduce postoperative complications across various surgical subspecialties [ 25 26 27 28 29 A multidisciplinary approach involving hepatologists, surgeons, medicine physicians, and nutritionists to manage liver dysfunction is imperative to optimize patient outcomes in head and neck reconstruction surgeries. Furthermore, shared decision‐making and patient discussions about surgical risks, benefits, and liver function optimization ensure a personalized and effective treatment plan. This patient‐centered approach fosters better understanding and cooperation, ultimately contributing to improved surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction. 4.4 Limitations and Future Directions This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the retrospective nature of the study design inherently limits the ability to establish causality between liver disease severity and postoperative complications in head and neck MFTT surgeries. Additionally, the reliance on the NSQIP database, while extensive, may be subject to data entry errors, missing data, and coding inconsistencies, which could impact the accuracy of our findings. The exclusion of cases with unknown lab values necessary to calculate the MELD‐Na and APRI scores may have skewed the cohort, potentially affecting the representativeness of our sample. Lastly, the NSQIP database does not provide detailed information on long‐term outcomes beyond the 30‐day postoperative period, limiting our understanding of the longer‐term implications of liver disease on surgical outcomes. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the impact of liver disease on head and neck MFTT surgeries, underscoring the need for tailored perioperative management strategies in this high‐risk patient population. Future research should focus on prospective studies to better establish causal relationships between liver disease and surgical outcomes in head and neck MFTT surgeries. Additionally, investigations into long‐term outcomes and the effectiveness of tailored perioperative management strategies for patients with liver disease are essential to further improve surgical care and patient prognosis in this high‐risk population. 5 Conclusion This study underscores the significant association between ALD and postoperative complications in patients undergoing head and neck MFTT surgeries. ALD is correlated with an increased likelihood of OR returns and reoperation, with no significant association with readmission rates. Our findings highlight the importance of thorough preoperative assessment and the possible role for preoperative optimization of liver function to mitigate surgical risks. While liver disease is associated with poor surgical outcomes, its specific implications in head and neck MFTT surgeries have yet to be investigated. This study characterized these associations and demonstrated the need for tailored perioperative management strategies to improve patient outcomes. Future prospective studies should validate these findings and explore long‐term outcomes to further enhance the care of this high‐risk population.
