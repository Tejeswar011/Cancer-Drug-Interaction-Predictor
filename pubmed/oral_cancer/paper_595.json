The respiratory system relies on a diverse repertoire of epithelial cell types to ensure efficient air conduction and gas exchange. This cellular heterogeneity arises through tightly coordinated intercellular signaling events that extend from embryonic development into the postnatal period. Among the key regulatory pathways, Notch signaling plays an integral role in guiding cell fate determination, proliferation, and differentiation. It is indispensable for the proper formation, maintenance, and repair of the airway epithelium. This review examines the broad influence of Notch signaling on mammalian airway epithelial biology and highlights unresolved questions—particularly those specific to human lung development—where human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived models offer promising tools to bridge existing knowledge gaps. notch signaling lung development airway epithelial cells lung differentiation induced pluripotent stem cells regeneration and repair The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. 2021 Stem Cell Network Innovation Award awarded to APW; 2020 SickKids/CIHR IHDCYH New Investigator grant awarded to APW and the 2023 Canadian Lung Associate (CLA) studentship awarded to YS. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Stem Cell Research Introduction The mammalian lung is the primary site of gas exchange, comprising anatomically and functionally distinct compartments. The upper airway includes the nasal and oral cavities, pharynx, and larynx, whereas the lower airway consists of the trachea, bronchioles, and alveolar sacs. Within the lower airway, proximal regions (trachea and bronchi) function chiefly in air conduction, while distal regions (respiratory bronchioles and alveoli) are specialized for gas exchange, each harboring unique epithelial niches ( Weibel, 2017 Van Scott et al., 2013 Pohunek, 2004 Banov, 1989 Human and mouse lung morphogenesis Lung morphogenesis proceeds through five stages in both humans and mice: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar. The first four stages occur in utero Nikolić et al., 2018 Swarr and Morrisey, 2015 Cardoso and Lü, 2006 Nikolić et al., 2018 Swarr and Morrisey, 2015 Cardoso and Lü, 2006 Nikolić et al., 2018 Swarr and Morrisey, 2015 Cardoso and Lü, 2006 Nikolić et al., 2018 Swarr and Morrisey, 2015 Cardoso and Lü, 2006 Progenitor behavior is patterned along the proximal–distal axis, with region-specific niches guiding proliferation, migration, and differentiation ( Eenjes et al., 2022 Zhang et al., 2024 Noguchi et al., 2020 Candeli and Dayton, 2024 Branchfield et al., 2016 Xu et al., 2020 Hussain et al., 2017 Frum et al., 2023 Rey et al., 2022 Kiyokawa and Morimoto, 2020 Cumplido-Laso et al., 2023 The proximal pseudostratified epithelium contains basal stem cells (BSC), expressing P63 and KRT5, club cells (SCGB1A1+, CCSP+), secretory cell subset (SCGB3A1+, SCGB3A2+) ( Reynolds et al., 2002 Montoro et al., 2018 Plasschaert et al., 2018 Figure 1A Rock et al., 2009 Deprez et al., 2020 Bustamante-Marin and Cilia, 2017 Yuan et al., 2023 Weibel, 2017 Van Scott et al., 2013 Banov, 1989 FIGURE 1  (A) + + (B) A) Comparison of the airway epithelial structure in humans and mice. In humans, the airway is lined with pseudostratified, columnar, and cuboidal epithelium containing diverse cell types, including basal stem cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), and goblet cells. While mice share a generally similar airway structure, they display notable differences—most prominently, a lower abundance of goblet cells. The accompanying legend identifies the distinct epithelial cell types. Features specific to mice are highlighted in red, and those specific to humans are shown in black. B) Schematic representation of the canonical Notch signaling pathway in both its activated and inactivated states. Notably, humans and mice differ in epithelial distribution. In humans, the pseudostratified epithelium spans the entire human conducting airway from the trachea to the bronchioles but in mice, this is confined to the trachea and main bronchi ( Nikolić et al., 2018 Danopoulos et al., 2019 Reynolds et al., 2002 Danopoulos et al., 2019 Basil et al., 2022 Dodd et al., 2024 Kim et al., 2005 Canonical notch signaling Mammals express four Notch receptors (NOTCH1–4, single pass transmembrane protein) and five ligands (JAG1/2, DLL1/3/4), four of them are canonical ligands (JAG1/2, DLL1/4) ( Gomi et al., 2015 Stupnikov et al., 2019 Figure 1B Alabi et al., 2018 D’Souza et al., 2010 Kar et al., 2021 D’Souza et al., 2010 Notch signaling in mouse airway development Notch pathway components are expressed from the earliest lung bud stages (mouse E9–12), orchestrating proximal–distal fate decisions ( Tsao et al., 2008 Kong et al., 2004 Nkx2.1+ Sox2+ Nkx2.1, Bmp4, Sftpc Sox2 Tsao et al., 2008 F/–;Shh /+ , Sox2 Tsao et al., 2009 Spatial and temporal expression patterns of individual Notch receptors and ligands hint at specialized roles. NOTCH1 is enriched in the distal endoderm from E11.5–E13.5, whereas NOTCH2/3 localizes to mesenchyme, as shown by in situ Post et al., 2000 Ito et al., 2000 Uyttendaele et al., 1996 Notch1/2/3 Notch1 Kong et al., 2004 Jag1 Jag2 Jag2 Jag1 Stupnikov et al., 2019 Kong et al., 2004 Zhang et al., 2013 Dll1 Post et al., 2000 Within the proximal epithelium, Notch directs the emergence of cellular diversity ( Figure 2A Ito et al., 2000 Morimoto et al., 2012 Dll1/Dll4 Ascl1 Cgrp Stupnikov et al., 2019 Notch2 Sox2+ Scgb3a2+ Kiyokawa et al., 2021 Notch2 Kiyokawa et al., 2021 Notch1 2 Morimoto et al., 2012 Guseh et al., 2009 Boucherat et al., 2012 Notch2 Cc10+ Morimoto et al., 2012 Sox2+ Notch2 Krt17  + Kiyokawa et al., 2021 FIGURE 2  (A) (B) Comparison diagram of lung progenitor development in mice (left) and humans (right). Mice stages include embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, and alveolar stages, showing pathways of progenitor cell differentiation with Notch signaling. Human stages mirror mice, displaying gestational weeks instead of embryonic days. Various progenitor and differentiated cells are indicated, with arrows representing developmental pathways. Limited studies on NOTCH regulation during human fetal airway development Although limited, current studies on Notch regulation during human fetal airway development highlight a significant knowledge gap. Most of our understanding of Notch receptor–ligand interactions during fetal airway development derives from murine models, which have elucidated roles for Notch1–3 and ligands Dll1/4 and Jag1/2 in proximal–distal patterning and epithelial differentiation ( Stupnikov et al., 2019 Tsao et al., 2008 Tsao et al., 2009 Ito et al., 2000 Zhang et al., 2013 Morimoto et al., 2012 Kiyokawa et al., 2021 Guseh et al., 2009 Boucherat et al., 2012 Figure 2 Chen et al., 2019 Rey et al., 2022 Gomi et al., 2015 Giuranno et al., 2020 Gomi et al., 2016 Kang et al., 2011 Vladar et al., 2023 Bodas et al., 2021 Danahay et al., 2015 Marcet et al., 2011 Bou Saab et al., 2016 Paul et al., 2014 in vitro in utero Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)–based platforms now offer a scalable, stage‐specific system for modeling airway morphogenesis. Directed differentiation of hiPSCs recapitulates successive milestones from definitive endoderm to mature, pseudostratified airway epithelium, enabling temporal control of Notch pathway perturbation ( Wang et al., 2023 de Carvalho et al., 2019 Hor et al., 2020 Overall, hiPSC‐derived airways, human lung organoids, and ex vivo Notch signaling in mouse airway regeneration The adult airway epithelium undergoes continual turnover—estimated to be every 30–50 days in rodents and there are limited studies in humans ( Bowden, 1983 Rock et al., 2009 Travaglini et al., 2020 Mou et al., 2021 Wu et al., 2022 Eenjes et al., 2022 Wu et al., 2022 Sriu et al., 2002 Figures 2A,B In mouse conducting airway, Notch1/2 Morimoto et al., 2012 Morimoto et al., 2010 Lingamallu et al., 2024 Notch1 2 Lafkas et al., 2015 Zhang et al., 2013 Lafkas et al., 2015 Mori et al., 2015 Figure 2A Lafkas et al., 2015 Guseh et al., 2009 Boucherat et al., 2012 Morimoto et al., 2010 Ou-Yang et al., 2013 Figure 2A Notch3 Krt8+, Tp63– Mori et al., 2015 Mori et al., 2015 Rock et al., 2011 Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015 Ascl1 Ascl2 Ascl3 Nfia Noguchi et al., 2020 Montoro et al., 2018 Following chemical injuries such as naphthalene, sulfur dioxide, chlorine gas, or polidocanol treatment, Notch signaling is a key pathway for efficient regeneration in mouse airways ( Paul et al., 2014 Morimoto et al., 2010 Rock et al., 2011 Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015 Ouadah et al., 2019 Yao et al., 2018 Xing et al., 2012 Ouadah et al., 2019 Yao et al., 2018 Ruiz Ga et al., 2019 Tp63–, Krt8+) Rock et al., 2011 Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015 c-myb Rbpjκ Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015 Paul et al., 2014 Notch signaling in human airway regeneration In human primary ALI and 3D bronchosphere models, broad inhibition of NOTCH signaling using small molecules like DAPT or DBZ reduces the number of secretory cells and ionocytes, while promoting expansion of basal and ciliated cell populations ( Rey et al., 2022 Plasschaert et al., 2018 Gomi et al., 2015 Gomi et al., 2016 Danahay et al., 2015 Paul et al., 2014 Gomi et al., 2015 Further evidence from a doxycycline-inducible NICD1 system in iPSC-derived BSC-like cells showed that NOTCH1 activation does not promote ionocyte differentiation ( Wang et al., 2023 Danahay et al., 2015 Danahay et al., 2015 Danahay et al., 2015 Additional support for Notch signaling’s role in human airway cell development comes from studies that manipulate NOTCH ligands or downstream transcriptional regulators. For instance, lentiviral overexpression or knockdown of the ligand JAG1 selectively influences the expansion of secretory cell lineages, while leaving ciliated cell populations unaffected ( Gomi et al., 2015 Gomi et al., 2016 Marcet et al., 2011 Ruiz Ga et al., 2019 Altogether, these findings emphasize the intricate specificity of the NOTCH pathway in directing cell lineage outcomes, which is essential for refining differentiation protocols aimed at generating specialized cell types from human iPSCs. Disease‐associated analyses implicate aberrant Notch activity in chronic airway disorders. In cystic fibrosis (CF), increased basal proliferation and ciliated cell loss coincides with heightened Notch signaling; DBZ/DAPT treatment restores ciliated abundance in CF epithelium ( Vladar et al., 2023 Bou Saab et al., 2016 Barbry et al., 2020 Tilley et al., 2009 Discrepant outcomes in notch–mediated regulation in airway lineages While most murine studies consistently show that Notch activation inhibits ciliated cell differentiation and that its suppression promotes multiciliogenesis ( Stupnikov et al., 2019 Tsao et al., 2008 Tsao et al., 2009 Morimoto et al., 2012 Guseh et al., 2009 Vladar et al., 2023 Danahay et al., 2015 Lafkas et al., 2015 Kiyokawa et al., 2021 Ouadah et al., 2019 Xing et al., 2012 Morimoto et al., 2012 Human airway studies also reveal conflicting data. In primary human cell cultures, most reports show that Notch inhibition promotes ciliated cell formation ( Plasschaert et al., 2018 Giuranno et al., 2020 Vladar et al., 2023 Danahay et al., 2015 Marcet et al., 2011 Bou Saab et al., 2016 de Carvalho et al., 2019 Gomi et al., 2016 Bodas et al., 2021 Hor et al., 2020 Gomi et al., 2015 Bodas et al., 2021 NOTCH1/3 activation and NOTCH2 inhibition are key in human mature airway cell fate decisions ( Gomi et al., 2015 Bodas et al., 2021 Danahay et al., 2015 Hor et al., 2020 Ou-Yang et al., 2013 Morimoto et al., 2012 Kiyokawa et al., 2021 Danahay et al., 2015 Morimoto et al., 2010 Lafkas et al., 2015 Mori et al., 2015 Together, these inconsistencies underscore the need to dissect receptor- and ligand-specific contributions, as well as the influence of developmental stage, injury context, and species differences, on Notch-driven airway lineage allocation. Harnessing hiPSC-Based models and cutting-edge genomic technologies to elucidate notch signaling dynamics Many hiPSC-derived airway epithelium differentiation protocols have leveraged Notch signaling regulation, highlighting its importance and potential on lineage regulation during human lung development and homeostasis. Particularly, DAPT had been applied to induce the differentiation of CFTR-expressing ciliated cells in fetal airway organoids ( Wong et al., 2015 Ngan et al., 2022 Konishi et al., 2016 Firth et al., 2014 de Carvalho et al., 2019 Hor et al., 2020 Wong et al., 2015 Konishi et al., 2016 Firth et al., 2014 Ahmed et al., 2022 Marcoux et al., 2023 Human iPSC-derived models of airway epithelium, when integrated with powerful gene-editing platforms such as CRISPR/Cas9 and prime editing, enable the creation of epithelial cell lines with targeted knock-in or knock-out modifications to Notch receptors and transcription factors. These cell lines facilitate receptor-specific investigations across various stages of lung development ( Huang and Loewer, 2022 Shakiba et al., 2019 in-vitro Quach et al., 2024 Despite advances, studies exploring the dynamic interactions between specific Notch receptor-ligand pairs during lung development remain limited. Emerging single-cell spatial transcriptomic platforms ( Garcia-Alonso et al., 2021 Armingol et al., 2022 Discussion In this review, we have highlighted the complex role of Notch signaling in lung development and regeneration. There are extensive studies in mouse models demonstrating the importance of the Notch signaling pathway in development and regeneration, and particularly its role in cellular differentiation. Understandably, there is less research on the role of this pathway in human airways, especially in the context of lung development and disease. Two studies highlight the essential role of Notch signaling in regulating epithelial basal cell function using hiPSCs and mouse genetic models ( Huang et al., 2024 Zhang et al., 2018 Despite the physiological parallels between mice and humans, murine models fall short in fully replicating the entirety of human physiology. In addition, the effects of Notch signaling in early human lung development remain ambiguous. With advancements in human iPSC-derived models combined with effective gene targeting tools and powerful platforms such as cellular barcoding and single cell spatial transcriptomics technologies, these will become important tools to uncover the role of Notch signaling in human lung models. The experimentally tractable models of iPSC differentiation enable temporal studies of the effects of Notch (and other pathways) in lung development and repair. Overall, future studies leveraging human iPSC-derived airway epithelium models may reveal the complex dynamic role of Notch signaling across development from fetal to “adulthood” (maturation), informing how cells emerge to how they are regenerated and the impact on disease.
