Endometriosis (EMS) is an oestrogen-dependent condition characterised by ectopic endometrial-like tissue growth with a chronic and inflammatory nature leading to severe symptoms and reduced quality of life. Emerging evidence implicates gut microbiome dysbiosis in EMS pathogenesis, driving chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and altered bacterial taxa within patient gut microbiome. This review examines the intricate relationship between gut dysbiosis and EMS, with a focus on immunomodulatory mechanisms and the downstream consequences of the bacterial contamination theory. It evaluates recent findings regarding microbial imbalances and microbial diversity, pinpointing gaps in current research that mandate further understanding.

These fragments can then implant in the pelvis (ovaries, fallopian tubes, peritoneal surfaces, bowel, bladder), proliferating into invasive lesions that bleed and grow in a manner similar to the uterine lining. This process results in the development of adhesions, fibrosis, and ultimately localised inflammation ( 8 10 Beyond immune dysregulation, imbalances and alterations in gut microbiota such as an altered Bacillota/Bacteroidota 11 12 13 4 2 The role of gut microbiome in driving dysbiosis in endometriosis 2.1 Role of the gut microbiome in health and disease The gut microbiome comprises all microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, including their genes and metabolites, within a specific anatomical site. In contrast, the microbiota refers solely to the community of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and protozoa ( 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 22 The gut microbiome exists in two primary states. The eubiotic 23 dysbiosis 24 26 27 Bacillota Bacteroidota Pseudomonadota Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes Lactobacillus Bacillota/Bacteroidota Expanding the scope beyond the extensively studied gut microbiome, the vaginal microbial ecosystem represents a critical, yet often underappreciated, facet of women’s health, especially relevant in the context of EMS. The vaginal microbiome is a complex community of microorganisms, with its composition significantly influencing local immunity and susceptibility to gynaecological conditions ( 28  Figure 1 Lactobacillus 29 30 Lactobacillus crispatus Lactobacillus iners Lactobacillus Gardnerella vaginalis Escherichia coli 30 Lactobacillus 31 Figure 1 The four main outcomes of immune dysregulation in endometriosis. Impaired immune surveillance is characterised by a reduction in natural killer (NK) cell activity observed in EMS patients. A cytokine storm reflects the excessive recruitment and over-activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cells, which heavily contribute to chronic and severe inflammation. Within the context of gut dysbiosis, an increase in gut permeability can lead to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory bacterial metabolites like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) entering systemic circulation, exacerbating this immune dysregulation. Contrarily, a reduction in beneficial Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), produced by a healthy gut microbiota, diminishes their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects, further contributing to the inflammatory cascade. The immune cells, cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors depicted in the centre of the image, along with adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis and proliferation on the right, arise as downstream effects of diminished immune surveillance and increased inflammation as illustrated on the left. Together, these processes promote lesion survival and further exacerbate the inflammatory nature of the condition playing a major role in the pathogenesis of EMS.

Labels include IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-alpha, ROS, VEGF, IL-8, LPS, SCFAs, and JAK. 2.2 Microbial alpha diversity alterations in endometriosis as a consequence of dysbiosis Numerous studies highlight how altered microbial diversity and populations are present in EMS patients, however the nature of these changes is still unclear (  Figure 2 32 p p 32 −5 33 34 35 in vitro 36 37 38 39 40 Figure 2 Interplay Between the Four Main Gut Microbiome Phyla, their Respective Taxa, and Immune Dysregulation in Endometriosis. As highlighted in the studies discussed above, these phyla and taxa exhibit altered abundances in EMS patients. This network illustrates their dysregulated immunomodulatory roles within the context of gut dysbiosis and emphasises their biological contribution to the progression of the condition. Bacteroidota does not directly produce endotoxin, it's production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is linked to increased endotoxin levels. These inconsistent findings regarding microbial diversity in EMS are likely influenced by several methodological limitations. Notably, studies by Shan et al. ( 33 39 34 2.3 Specific taxa alterations and their relevance in endometriosis Several studies have reported concurrent findings regarding dysbiotic shifts in bacterial taxa across the four main gut phyla. For example, Huang et al. ( 41 34 Bacillota Clostridia Lachnospiraceae 42 34 Prevotella 34 Concurrently, an increase in Actinomycetota Eggerthella lenta 34 43 39 44 Actinomycetota Oxalobacteraceae, Streptococcaceae, Bifidobacterium Parasutterella 45 46 Furthermore, the two other major gut microbiome phyla Pseudomonadota Bacteroidota 41 34 Bacteroidota Parabacteroidota 34 41 Escherichia coli (Pseudomonadota) Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroidota 47 Pseudomonadota Escherichia Shigella 44 48 49 2.4 Altered Bacillota Bacteroidota As previously mentioned, measures of biodiversity, alongside the abundances of specific taxa, serve as key indicators of gut dysbiosis. Another commonly utilised parameter for assessing microbial dysbiosis is the ratio of the two predominant phyla in the gut, Bacillota Bacteroidota 27 50 52 Bacillota/Bacteroidota 33 48 48 53 Bacillota/Bacteroidota Overall, there appears to be a consistent shift towards a pro-inflammatory, disrupted gut microbial composition and function in EMS patients. This shift is mainly characterised by an enrichment of proinflammatory Actinomycetota Firmicutes Pseudomonadota Bacteroidota 54 Bacillota/Bacteroidota 3 Examining the disruption of immunomodulation in endometriosis 3.1 Bacterial contamination, immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation Emerging evidence suggests a significant association between gut microbiome dysbiosis and immune system dysregulation, contributing to the chronic inflammation that is the hallmark of endometriosis. Khan’s theory highlights how disruptions in gastrointestinal tract maintenance, mucosal integrity, and barrier function promote intestinal permeability, leakage of metabolites, and inflammatory changes (  Figure 3 9 55 56 57 58 p Pseudomonadota Escherichia coli p 58 E. coli 44 44 Shigella/Escherichia Figure 3 Downstream Effects of Disrupted Epithelial Barrier Integrity Due to Gut Dysbiosis in Endometriosis. The figure illustrates the cascade of signalling events, collectively known as the “Bacterial Contamination Theory.” This theory provides a mechanism explaining how gut dysbiosis in EMS leads to increased concentrations of endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the menstrual effluent of patients. Furthermore, it links the presence of LPS to immune dysregulation and inflammation. In the bottom right corner, a spider diagram summarises how further research into the cellular and molecular components of this signalling cascade could aid in the development of microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics. Diagram titled “Pathogenesis of Endometriosis via Bacterial Contamination Theory,” illustrating steps: gut dysbiosis disrupting bacterial balance; barrier integrity disruption allowing leakage; E. coli translocation into the pelvic cavity; TLR4 activation by LPS, leading to immune dysfunction. Supporting evidence from menstrual effluent backs the leaky gut theory. Elements include Lactobacillus, E. coli, SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids), LPS (lipopolysaccharides), occludin, claudin, TLR4, NF-kB, IL-6, and TNFα. A compromised barrier may facilitate the translocation of Escherichia coli 44 58 33 59 62 9 63 64 Beyond direct immune activation, dysbiosis may also disrupt mucosal tolerance mechanisms fundamental to immune homeostasis. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which includes Peyer’s patches, isolated lymphoid follicles and mesenteric lymph nodes; serves as a key component for mucosal immunity. These structures help maintain a delicate balance between immune tolerance towards commensal microbes and dietary antigens, and activation against potential pathogens ( 65 15 Bacteroides fragilis 66 67 Firmicutes 68 3.2 The estrobolome While bacterial contamination and endotoxin-induced immune responses form one axis of immunomodulatory disruption in endometriosis, another critical but often underexplored pathway lies in the interplay between the gut microbiome and oestrogen metabolism; referred to as the estrobolome 69 70 71 Lactobacillus 72  Figure 4 Figure 4 Summary of studies on different Lactobacillus Lactobacillus Comparison chart exploring the potential of various Lactobacillus species in alleviating endometriosis symptoms. Five studies are highlighted, each involving different Lactobacillus strains: L. gasseri, L. acidophilus, and L. plantarum. Each column outlines the study's focus, methodology, and findings, such as effects on dysmenorrhea, lesion reduction, cytokine production, and fertility. The chart includes illustrations of mice and human figures, representing subjects in the studies. Key outcomes include lesion weight reduction, endometrial tissue response, and fertility impacts. The gut microbiome houses the genetic inventory to produce oestrogen-metabolising enzymes; particularly β-glucuronidase and β-glucosidase, through a subset of microbial genes collectively known as the estrobolome 69 Bacteroides Bifidobacterium Escherichia Lactobacillus 73 74 Bacillota/Bacteroidota 75 The downstream effects of an overactive estrobolome estrobolome 76 3.3 Impaired immune surveillance and its role in lesion survival in endometriosis The immune microenvironment of endometriotic lesions is profoundly influenced by chronic exposure to bacterial products, which impairs immune surveillance and promotes lesion survival. This exposure, particularly through LPS-TLR4 signalling, drives a shift in macrophage polarisation toward an immunosuppressive, M2-like phenotype. These pathogenic M2 macrophages, a major cellular component within endometriotic lesions, are found in significantly greater numbers in patients with EMS. Elevated levels of IL - 17A in both plasma and lesions have been shown to stimulate this pathogenic M2 polarisation ( 77 78 79 The permissive immune environment of endometriosis is not only defined by macrophage polarisation; it also involves significant alterations in other immune cell populations. To demonstrate, data from a study on EMS patients (n=6-8) showed significantly reduced levels of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in menstrual effluent (5 – 10%) compared to control subjects (10 – 40%) (p=0.01) ( 80 81 82 83 Alongside their altered phenotypes, dysfunctional macrophages in EMS patients are found in significantly greater numbers, facilitating the development of a distinct pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. This includes elevated levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL - 8), interleukin-1 receptor (IL - 1R), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL - 6), and interleukin-17 (IL - 17). This profile may not only contribute to local and systemic inflammation but also holds promise as an immunological biomarker. In this case, integrating cytokine profiling with metabolomic analyses (discussed in Section 5) could help identify predictive readouts of disease activity or therapeutic responsiveness. A pivotal study by Shan et al, demonstrated that dysbiosis heightened pathways that promoted NF-kB and therefore IL - 8 and TNF-α expression; all contributing to an inflammatory response ( 33 59 62 60 In support, numerous studies have noted evidence of bacterial contamination and elevated inflammatory markers. For example, IL - 17A levels have been shown to positively correlate with the abundance of Bacteroides Streptococcus Bifidobacterium 33 Actinobacteria Euryarchaeota Fusobacteria Lentisphaerae Spirochaetes Synergistetes 81 Porphyromonas Prevotella 4 Current endometriosis landscape: burden, diagnostics, and treatment obstacles Finding a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for endometriosis (EMS) is critical due to its profound impact on patients and healthcare systems. EMS significantly impairs physical and mental well-being, leading to higher rates of depression (18.9% vs. 9.3%) and anxiety (29.7% vs. 7.0%) compared to healthy controls ( 84 85 88 89 90 92 93 94 95 96 97 5 Future directions of endometriosis management Building on the urgent need for improved strategies, future directions in EMS management are exploring novel, personalised approaches. Emerging research within the field of the gut microbiome suggests that addressing gut dysbiosis and its role in immunomodulation is the key to uncovering the mechanisms underlying the bidirectional relationship between the microbiome and endometriosis. Relevant and significant approaches include the utilisation of probiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) which aim to restore eubiosis alongside omics analyses of metabolic derivatives associated with inflammation. These nuanced strategies show great promise in identifying microbial biomarkers for diagnosis and in the provision of personalised therapeutics aimed at alleviating pain, thus paving the way for tailored clinical approaches in the management of endometriosis. 5.1  Lactobacillus- Many researchers have turned to the microbiome in search of answers regarding EMS diagnosis and treatment, spurred by recent findings regarding probiotics’ potential to address a range of diverse health issues from infections and rare genetic disorders to cancer ( 98 99 Lactobacilli 100 101 102 Lactobacillus ® Lactobacillus gasseri 103 L. gasseri 103 Regarding the immunomodulatory effects of Lactobacillus 104 L.acidophilus 104 102 103 105 L.plantarum 106 107 108 L. reuteri 108 Overall, these findings are impressive however they also highlight the inadequacy of a “one-size-fits-all” approach, as individual efficacy likely varies widely due to the complex interplay of host and microbial factors. Standardised methodologies and large-scale studies encompassing ethnically diverse cohorts are essential for establishing reliable microbial biomarkers. Given the observed variation in EMS immunomodulation across ethnicities, with a higher prevalence reported within Asian women ( 109 5.2 Conventional and autologous faecal microbiota transplantation in restoring eubiosis An alternative technology to probiotics, is faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). It involves delivering stool from a healthy donor to a patient via either enema, colonoscopy or upper GI routes (endoscopy, nasogastric or nasoenteric tubes or oral capsules) ( 110 111 eubiosis 112 Clostridioides difficile 113 To date, there are currently no clinical reports that outline FMT application in gynaecological disorders except in mouse models. However, laboratory research data provides a solid foundation to encourage further studies involving human models. For instance, a study conducted by Kim et al. ( 114 B.longum L.plantarum Pseudomonadota Bacteroidota. 114 However, FMT’s risks and challenges must be accounted for as well. A successful FMT requires strict donor selection that excludes immunocompromised or comorbid patients, fresh treatment preparation and pathogen screening. Satisfying all these criteria proves challenging in both logistic and financial aspects ( 115 116 117 5.3 Metabolomics profiling in the development of microbial biomarkers In parallel with mechanistic-focused research, the incorporation of advanced omics techniques, particularly metabolomics should be a priority in future investigations. Metabolomics refers to the analysis of small-molecule metabolites in tissues or biofluids, providing insights into the physiological or pathological state of a system ( 118 119 121 48 122 123 123 To complement these metabolic markers, emerging evidence supports the use of immune cell-derived cytokines such as IL - 17A, IL - 6, and TNF-α as immunological biomarkers of dysbiosis. These pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in EMS and are closely tied to microbial imbalances, especially in the gut and reproductive tract. IL - 17A, for example, shows strong correlations with specific microbial taxa such as Bacteroides and is known to drive inflammatory tissue responses ( 33 Metabolomics holds vast potential for non-invasive and precise detection of immunomodulatory disruptions caused by EMS. This innovative approach could be leveraged to monitor disease progression, stratify patients, and enable personalised treatments tailored to individual metabolomic profiles. 6 Conclusion Gut dysbiosis is increasingly recognised as a key factor in the pathogenesis of EMS, particularly through its dysregulation of key processes within the female reproductive system. These include the modulation of oestrogen pathways, metabolic derivatives, oxidative stress, and immune-mediated inflammation. This paper specifically focuses on the dysregulation of immunomodulation and its role in driving immune dysfunction and perpetuating chronic inflammation. Underlying this immune imbalance is the disruption of mucosal immune structures (e.g GALT and Peyer’s patches), which normally support immune tolerance by mediating the microbiome’s regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Although microbiome-based therapies, such as probiotics and FMT hold considerable promise, their clinical implementation remains halted by unresolved questions regarding microbial diversity, safety, and efficacy. Progress in this field will require the integration of advanced omics technologies, large-scale cohort studies, and efforts to address ethical, genetic, diversity-related, and economic barriers. An extensive understanding of the connection between gut microbiota alterations to endometriosis is necessary. It could comprehensively map these pathways and tackle gaps in interpreting and translating gut microbiota findings, informing early diagnosis and targeted interventions in a non-invasive manner. Moreover, it could support the development of personalised therapeutic approaches, tailored to unique microbiome profiles and genetic predispositions of individual patients. However, achieving this will require collaborative research efforts to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and clinical application; this represents the critical key to unlocking the untapped potential of the gut microbiome in the care and management of endometriosis.
