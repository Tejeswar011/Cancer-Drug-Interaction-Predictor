This analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of ozanimod during the True North (TN) study and its open-label extension (OLE) in biologic-exposed patients with UC. METHODS: TN was a randomized, placebo-controlled 52-week trial (10-week induction, 42-week maintenance period). Eligible patients could enter the OLE. Clinical outcomes were assessed at TN week (W) 10 and W52 and OLE W46 and W94. Symptomatic efficacy was evaluated through induction and in the OLE until W94. Safety was assessed. RESULTS: This analysis included 376 biologic-exposed patients. In the placebo-controlled cohort, more ozanimod-treated patients achieved clinical response than placebo at W10 regardless of the number or type of prior biologics; patients who used 1 vs ≥2 prior biologics achieved higher efficacy rates. Efficacy rates were higher at W52 than W10 and were similar across subgroups regardless of the number or type of prior biologics. Significantly greater proportions of ozanimod vs placebo patients achieved symptomatic response by W5 ( P P DISCUSSION: Ozanimod was effective and safe in biologic-exposed patients with UC, but these patients may require more time to respond to treatment.

Patients exposed to a Janus kinase inhibitor were excluded from this analysis (n = 20) but were included in TN; because TN started before the approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of UC, tofacitinib exposure was limited. Analyses of subgroups of patients who were exposed to anti-TNFs (with or without exposure to another biologic), vedolizumab (with or without exposure to another biologic), or both an anti-TNF and vedolizumab (with or without exposure to another biologic) were performed. An analysis of the efficacy and safety of ozanimod in patients who were AT-naive has been previously published ( 30 Assessments and outcomes Efficacy. Patient-reported outcomes (rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores) were self-reported and collected in an electronic diary, and endoscopy and biopsy samples were analyzed centrally in a blinded manner, as described previously ( 27 The primary analysis of TN had a prespecified primary endpoint (i.e., clinical remission) and prespecified key secondary endpoints (i.e., clinical response, endoscopic improvement, mucosal healing, maintenance of clinical remission, corticosteroid-free remission, and durable clinical remission) ( 27 Clinical and symptomatic efficacy outcomes (Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/AJG/D531 Symptomatic response and remission were evaluated through the IP from week 2 to week 10 to determine the onset of action in biologic-exposed patients. The effect of extended induction with ozanimod during the OLE was assessed in biologic-exposed patients who were TN week 10 ozanimod clinical nonresponders and continued ozanimod in the OLE. Symptomatic response and remission in TN week 10 clinical nonresponders were evaluated through OLE week 94, and clinical response, clinical remission, and corticosteroid-free remission were evaluated at OLE weeks 46 and 94. The long-term efficacy of ozanimod over 3 years was analyzed in biologic-exposed patients who achieved clinical response to ozanimod at TN week 52 and entered the OLE. Clinical response, clinical remission, and corticosteroid-free remission were evaluated at OLE weeks 46 and 94, and symptomatic response and remission were evaluated through OLE week 94 (approximately 2 years of ozanimod exposure in the OLE). Safety. Safety assessments were evaluated by treatment-emergent adverse events, adverse events of special interest based on those with previous associations with other S1P receptor modulators, and clinical laboratory abnormalities that occurred in TN. Statistical analysis This study included a post hoc analysis of TN and an interim analysis of the TN OLE, which evaluated data up to OLE week 94 (∼2 years in the OLE). All patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug were included. In the TN IP, statistical comparisons were performed for efficacy endpoints in cohort 1, whereas efficacy endpoints in cohort 2 were described descriptively. Efficacy endpoints, treatment differences, 2-sided 95% Wald confidence intervals (CIs), and P Ethical considerations This analysis adhered to the Good Clinical Practices guidelines and the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Investigators at each study site obtained protocol and informed consent approval from an Institutional Review Board or independent ethics committee. Written consent was obtained from each patient in the study, which was sponsored by Bristol Myers Squibb. RESULTS Study population Disposition. Of the 1,012 patients who entered TN, 376 (38%) patients were biologic-exposed (cohort 1, placebo, n = 76, and ozanimod, n = 139; cohort 2, ozanimod, n = 161) and included in this analysis. Further details on patient disposition are summarized in Supplementary Results and depicted in Supplementary Figure 2 ( http://links.lww.com/AJG/D531 Baseline TN patient demographic and clinical characteristics were generally similar among the biologic-exposed treatment groups in the overall population (Table 1 http://links.lww.com/AJG/D531 Table 1. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics in biologic-exposed patients in the TN IP Efficacy Efficacy by number of prior biologics. Clinical response rates at week 10 were higher in patients receiving ozanimod, regardless of the number of prior biologics, compared with those receiving placebo in cohort 1. Ozanimod-treated patients exposed to 1 vs ≥2 prior biologics achieved higher rates of clinical response (50.0% vs 27.2%) and clinical remission (17.2% vs 3.7%), respectively; differences in proportions between the ozanimod and placebo groups for these outcomes were also higher in patients exposed to 1 vs ≥2 prior biologics (Figure 1 1 Figure 1. Efficacy of ozanimod vs placebo by the number of prior biologics in biologic-exposed patients. ( a b Efficacy by type of prior biologic. More patients receiving ozanimod achieved clinical response at week 10 compared with placebo in cohort 1, regardless of prior anti-TNF, prior vedolizumab, or prior anti-TNF and vedolizumab exposure. Although clinical remission rates at week 10 were low in ozanimod-treated patients regardless of the prior type of biologic exposure, rates of clinical response were substantially higher (Figure 2 2 Figure 2. Ozanimod efficacy by prior biologic type. ( a b Ozanimod efficacy in patients previously exposed to specific biologics was also evaluated, although the number of patients in each group was often small. More patients receiving ozanimod vs placebo achieved clinical remission and response at week 10 when exposed to 1 anti-TNF only, infliximab only, or adalimumab only (Supplementary Figure 3, http://links.lww.com/AJG/D531 http://links.lww.com/AJG/D531 Onset of action. The proportions of biologic-exposed patients who achieved symptomatic response were numerically greater with ozanimod than placebo by week 2 of the IP (placebo, 21.1%; cohort 1 ozanimod, 30.2%; cohort 2 ozanimod, 30.4%) (Figure 3 P P P 3 Figure 3. Onset of action. ( a b Efficacy and durability of response after extended induction with ozanimod in the OLE in biologic-exposed week 10 clinical nonresponders. Biologic-exposed patients who entered the OLE as TN week 10 ozanimod clinical nonresponders achieved symptomatic response and remission with an additional 5 and 10 weeks of ozanimod treatment in the OLE (Figure 4 5 Figure 4. Symptomatic efficacy from OLE week 5 to week 94 in biologic-exposed patients who were TN week 10 ozanimod clinical nonresponders and subsequently entered the OLE for extended induction treatment with ozanimod.

Efficacy at OLE weeks 46 and 94 in biologic-exposed patients who were TN week 10 ozanimod clinical nonresponders and subsequently entered the OLE for extended induction treatment with ozanimod. ( a b Long-term efficacy over 3 years of continuous ozanimod exposure in biologic-exposed week 52 clinical responders. Efficacy was maintained through OLE week 94 in biologic-exposed patients who entered the OLE as TN week 52 ozanimod clinical responders. At OLE week 94, 92.0%, 64.0%, and 64.0% of patients achieved clinical response, clinical remission, and corticosteroid-free remission, respectively, in the OC analysis; at OLE week 94, 50.0%, 34.8%, and 34.8% of patients achieved clinical response, clinical remission, and corticosteroid-free remission, respectively, in the NRI analysis (Figure 6 http://links.lww.com/AJG/D531 Figure 6. Efficacy at OLE weeks 46 and 94 in biologic-exposed patients who were TN week 52 ozanimod clinical responders and subsequently entered the OLE. ( a b Safety Ozanimod was well tolerated in biologic-exposed patients (Supplementary Table 3, http://links.lww.com/AJG/D531 27 DISCUSSION In the phase 3 TN trial of patients with moderately to severely active UC, 38% of patients had previous biologic exposure. This post hoc analysis of TN and interim analysis of the TN OLE demonstrated that ozanimod was effective and well tolerated in biologic-exposed patients, regardless of the number or type of prior biologics. Patients previously exposed to 1 vs ≥2 biologics responded faster with higher overall efficacy rates at week 10. Increases in efficacy rates were observed in biologic-exposed patients with continuous ozanimod exposure from the end of induction through week 52, especially in patients exposed to ≥2 biologics, with patients achieving similar efficacy rates at week 52 regardless of number or type of prior biologic exposures. Therefore, patients previously exposed to a higher number of biologics may require longer periods of ozanimod exposure to respond. In addition, more than half of week 10 ozanimod clinical nonresponders who entered the OLE achieved symptomatic response by OLE week 5, with rates of symptomatic response and remission increasing further to OLE week 10. Ozanimod efficacy was durable in biologic-exposed patients. Clinical and symptomatic outcomes were maintained in biologic-exposed patients who received approximately 3 years of continuous ozanimod throughout TN and the OLE. Additionally, biologic-exposed patients who were TN week 10 ozanimod clinical nonresponders achieved symptomatic efficacy with an additional 5–10 weeks of treatment in the OLE and maintained efficacy while receiving approximately 2 years of continuous ozanimod treatment in the OLE. Overall, responses to ozanimod were durable whether patients entered the OLE as a TN week 52 ozanimod clinical responder or TN week 10 ozanimod clinical nonresponder. A previous post hoc analysis of the TN and TN OLE evaluated the efficacy and safety of ozanimod in AT-naive patients and found that ozanimod was effective and well tolerated in AT-naive patients ( 30 30 30 http://links.lww.com/AJG/D531 30 30 Overall incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events in AT-naive patients ( 30 A common observation in inflammatory bowel disease is that many ATs are less effective in biologic-exposed patients than biologic-naive patients ( 19 22 39 6 7 10 12 39 40 10 1 41 42 Findings that biologic-exposed patients may be initially slower to respond to ozanimod than AT-naive patients are consistent with observations for other UC therapies. Studies have shown lower rates of clinical remission and clinical response with adalimumab and vedolizumab induction treatment in anti-TNF–exposed patients than anti-TNF–naive patients ( 19 19 19 The reason for lower initial response to ozanimod in biologic-exposed patients is not clear. Lower efficacy of anti-TNF induction therapy in patients already exposed to anti-TNFs has been hypothesized to be at least partially due to certain clinical features, such as longer disease duration and more complicated disease ( 7 Ozanimod is a convenient oral AT option ( 43 30 30 A limitation of this post hoc analysis is that TN was not designed or powered to explore specific patient subpopulations. In addition, although there were patients with prior exposure to ≥3 biologics, sample sizes were not large enough to assess efficacy in those patients. This analysis was also not designed to directly compare the current data in biologic-exposed patients with the previously published data in AT-naive patients ( 30 27 44 In conclusion, ozanimod was found to be effective and safe for patients with moderately to severely active UC who were previously exposed to biologic agents, including vedolizumab and anti-TNFs, with efficacy rates that reached those achieved in AT-naive patients over time ( 30 30 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Guarantor of the article: Specific author contributions: Financial support: Potential competing interests: Writing support: Data transparency statement: https://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/independent-research/data-sharing-request-process.html Study Highlights WHAT IS KNOWN ✓ Biologics and small molecules may be used as first-line advanced therapies in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) requiring therapy escalation. ✓ Patients receiving biologics may experience initial nonresponse or loss of response due to delayed response or immunogenicity, respectively. ✓ Subsequent advanced therapies usually have reduced efficacy in biologic-exposed patients compared with biologic-naive patients. ✓ Ozanimod is a highly selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC. ✓ Ozanimod is effective, durable, and well tolerated in advanced therapy–naive patients. WHAT IS NEW HERE ✓ Ozanimod was effective in biologic-exposed patients with UC (included those who were primary nonresponders, secondary nonresponders, and intolerant to biologics). ✓ Patients previously exposed to 1 vs ≥2 biologics responded faster with higher overall efficacy rates, but eventually all patients achieved similar efficacy. ✓ Ozanimod induction and maintenance efficacy were similar in patients with previous anti–tumor necrosis factor or vedolizumab exposure. ✓ Ozanimod showed early onset of action in biologic-exposed patients, with numerically higher proportions of patients on ozanimod than placebo achieving symptomatic response within 1 week of ozanimod dose titration and significant differences achieved by week 5 during induction therapy. ✓ Induction week 10 nonresponders achieved efficacy after 5–10 weeks of additional ozanimod treatment and maintained efficacy for ∼2 years in the open-label extension. ✓ Efficacy was maintained for an additional ∼2 years in biologic-exposed patients who entered the open-label extension as week 52 ozanimod responders. ✓ Ozanimod was well tolerated in biologic-exposed patients, with a safety profile consistent with the previously reported overall True North population.
