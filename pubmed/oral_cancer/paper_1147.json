Following the transformative impact of single-cell gene expression profiling techniques on numerous fields of human biology, recent years have seen increased application to microbes. We review progress in the development of these techniques and discuss challenges in applying them to microbial communities. We highlight applications for dissecting the microbiome in human health and disease that reveal functional heterogeneity within gut communities, antibiotic responses, and the dynamics of mobile genetic elements. As single-cell gene expression technologies continue to develop, they are becoming ever more essential for examining and modulating the role of microbial communities in clinical and wider environments. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
