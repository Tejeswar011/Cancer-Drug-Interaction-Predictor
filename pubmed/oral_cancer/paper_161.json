Conversion and prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) are essential requirements for its treatment. Abnormal leakage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) during diastole is considered a major cause of AF. Although catheter ablation has made it possible to stop persistent AF, it does not address recurrence. In this context, we describe the additional pharmacological and antiarrhythmic effects of the RyR2 inhibitor M201-A, including the results of a phase I study.

Moreover, we describe a study of orally administered K201 in patients with paroxysmal AF, which shows compelling evidence of patient exposure to the bioactive metabolite M201-A and its efficacy. Significantly, a phase I study confirmed the safety and tolerability of M201-A when administered at a dose that effectively targets key ion channels and RyR2. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 M201-A chemical structure M201-A has a chemical structure of (R)-4-[3-(4-benzylpiperidin-1-yl)propanoyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine-1-oxide (molecular weight, 440). The chemical structures of K201, M201-R, M201-A, and M201-B are shown in Fig. 1 21 1 13 21 Fig. 1 The process of M201-A synthesis from K201. The chemical structures of K201, M201-R, M201-A, and M201-B are shown. M201-R can be synthesized by the action of hydrogen peroxide on a formic acid solution of K201. M201-A and M201-B were separated from M201-R using a CHIRALPAK IC column (Daicel Corporation). 2.2 Effects of M201-A on ion channels Myocardial ion channel inhibition was assessed using stable cell lines transfected with human ion channel genes. K201 hydrochloride was evaluated by Chan Test Corporation, whereas M201-A hydrochloride (excluding the human ether-a-go-go-related gene [hERG, I Kr Supplemental Table 1 50 Supplemental Table 2 The effect of M201-A hydrochloride on the hERG current was assessed under Good Laboratory Practice compliance by LSI Medience Corporation.

A 5-second recording was made before applying M201-A for 30 minutes; subsequently, the measurements were repeated. An average of 10 sequential APs was recorded both before and after applying M201-A in DMSO or DMSO alone.

This study’s protocol involved enrollment of a maximum of 15 evaluable subjects. A total of 15 subjects were ultimately enrolled, with 3 subjects receiving a placebo and 12 subjects receiving active K201 treatment. All the inclusion and exclusion criteria are outlined in Supplemental Table 9 The relationship between blood concentrations of K201 and M201-R and the conversion of AF was investigated up to 120 minutes after oral administration of 540 mg K201. 2.9 Phase I clinical study of M201-A A registered phase I clinical trial (identifier: NCT03055403 Supplemental Table 3 Thirty-nine healthy male volunteers (aged 20–39 years) received intravenous infusions of M201-A hydrochloride or placebo control (physiological saline). M201-A was administered in the following 5 doses: 0.01 mg/kg ( n n At each time point, HR and BP were measured once, and ECGs were recorded 3 times. HR, BP, and ECG parameters were reported as the mean ± SD for each group. Corrected QT interval (QTc) values were recorded 3 times at each time point, and their changes over time were analyzed for each participant. QTc was estimated using Fridericia’s formula (QTc = QT/3√RR). Prior consultations with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency revealed that the maximum administered dose should be capped at 2000 ng/mL. 2.10 Plasma M201-A concentration measurement in dogs and humans Plasma M201-A concentrations in dogs were determined using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry with an high-performance liquid chromatography system (Nexera MP, Shimadzu Corp) and an tandem mass spectrometry system (Qtrap 6500, AB SCIEX) with an ODS-SP column (5 μ μ Supplemental Table 4 2.11 Animal experiments All animal experiments adhered to the Japanese “Act on Welfare and Management of Animals,” “Standards Relating to the Methods of Destruction of Animals,” and “Standards Relating to the Care and Keeping and Reducing Pain of Laboratory Animals.” The Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee of each involved institution approved the study protocol. 2.12 Data and statistical analyses Data are expressed as means ± SEMs unless otherwise specified. Statistical analyses of ERPs in dogs were conducted using one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test. For hemodynamic and ECG measurements in unanesthetized dogs, multivariate analyses with 2 factors (group and time) and a Dunnett multiple comparison test were employed. For all analyses, the threshold for statistical significance was set at 0.05. In studies involving hiPSC-CMs, unpaired ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. For the study involving dogs with chronic atrioventricular block, statistical significance within parameters was assessed using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA followed by contrasts as a post hoc test for mean value comparisons. Between paired data, significance was evaluated using the paired t 3 Results 3.1 Effects of M201-A on ion channel activities The inhibitory effects of M201-A on ion channels were investigated and compared with those of K201 using cell lines stably expressing human ion channel genes and atrial guinea pig myocytes ( Fig. 2 Supplemental Table 1 + I KACh μ 50 μ μ 50 μ 50 μ I Kr 50 μ I Na I Ca(L) 50 μ 50 I Na I Ca(L) μ Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Effects of M201-A on ion channel activities.

Basic research into AF pathogenesis has reported that abnormal Ca 2+ 17 , 18 , 20 , 27 28 , 29 Regarding the first key point, M201-A did not affect BP and HR but enhanced cardiac contraction and relaxation in rats. 21 30 9 , 31 , 32 Regarding the second key point, M201-A inhibited I KAch 50 μ μ I KACh 10 , 33 I KACh 33 , 34 dl 30 I KACh The third point concerns the proarrhythmic risk of M201-A. In conscious dogs equipped with telemeters, even an 8 mg/kg dose did not significantly prolong QTc, representing plasma concentrations of 6438 ng/mL (7.51 μ μ peak peak end 30 35 , 36 Generally, class III antiarrhythmic agents pose the most clinically significant risk of causing AP prolongation and triggering TdP with increasing doses. Dofetilide and ibutilide are class III antiarrhythmic agents. Dofetilide is more effective in patients with persistent than in those with paroxysmal AF/AF 37 38 39 To investigate the integrated effect of M201-A on APD, we investigated the dose–response relationship of M201-A in rabbit cardiac cells and induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). M201-A moderately prolonged the APD 90 μ 90 M201-A is characterized by limited QTc prolongation and low TdP risk despite strong hERG activity. Class III I Kr I Kr 40 I Na I Ca(L) 50 μ 41 90 μ 90 24 Ca(L) I Kr 25 2+ I Na Ca(L) The fourth key point is the effect of M201-A on AF conversion. The present study reported the relationship between blood M201-R levels and AF conversion in humans. Administering 540 mg K201 orally to patients with AF increased the unbound drug concentration of M201-R to 30-fold higher (approximately 15-fold for M201-A) than that of K201, and AF was converted in 6 of the 12 patients (50%) during the first 2 hours after administration. Three patients who received the placebo did not convert AF. This study revealed for the first time that K201 is converted to M201-R within 60 minutes of administration. At this point, M201-A had not yet been isolated; therefore, directly evaluating M201-A was not possible. After establishing a synthesis method for M201-R, the drug was experimentally administered to a canine model of AF, which effectively converted 2/2 (100%) of AF and 8/10 (80%) of atrial flutter. 42 43 21 Fig. 3 Supplemental Fig. 2 Regarding the fifth key point, abnormal SR Ca 2+ 2+ + 2+ 44 2+ 10 μ 16 45 Regarding the conversion of AF, the M201-A concentration of IC 50 I KAch μ μ μ μ Fig. 8 Fig. 8 21 Supplemental Table 4 Fig. 8 The relationship between the unbound drug concentration ( μ μ To date, CA therapy can convert both paroxysmal and persistent AF. Over the course of drug development history, the conversion of persistent AF has been challenging with drug administration alone. Recent advances in CA therapy have made conversion of persistent AF possible. However, the major issue is the high AF recurrence rate following CA in persistent AF, which is approximately 50% for 60 months. 28 , 29 This study had some limitations. The phase I clinical trial was exclusively conducted in healthy males. Notably, baseline QTcF intervals are typically longer in females, who are also at a higher risk for drug-induced TdP than males 46 5 Conclusion and implications M201-A inhibited I KACh 50 μ Conflict of interest The nonclinical and clinical trials conducted by AETAS Pharma Co, Ltd were funded by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.
