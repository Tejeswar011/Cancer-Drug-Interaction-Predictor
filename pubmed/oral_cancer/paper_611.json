The prevalence of dementia has increased from 8.4% in 2008 [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Numerous studies have reported malnutrition among older adults with dementia. Most studies have examined the prevalence of malnutrition and related factors in older adults with dementia residing in nursing homes or long-term care facilities [ 3 6 9 et al 7 3 et al 6 According to the 2022 Long-Term Care Survey, among 4,423 long-term care insurance (LTCI) beneficiaries, 54.4% had dementia [ 10 10 Recently, many countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have implemented community-based care models to enable individuals with dementia to live independently within their communities for as long as possible [ 11 12 Nutritional issues are an important factor affecting the quality of life, not only for older adults with dementia but also for those without dementia receiving long-term care [ 13 14 15 16 17 This study aimed to explore factors associated with malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults with and without dementia who receive long-term care. These findings provide a basis for developing nutrition management policies tailored to LTCI beneficiaries living at home. The specific research objectives are as follows: First, we aimed to identify the nutritional status of community-dwelling older adults with and without dementia who were LTCI recipients according to their sociodemographic characteristics, health, and functional status. Second, we aimed to identify the factors related to malnutrition in these groups. METHODS Ethics statement Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Health Insurance Services (approval number: 연-2021-HR-06-054). 1. Study design This cross-sectional descriptive and analytical study aimed to identify nutritional status based on sociodemographic characteristics and health and functional status, including identifying factors related to malnutrition in older adults with and without dementia receiving long-term care in community settings. This study was in accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) reporting guidelines ( https://www.strobe-statement.org/ 2. Study subjects and period The study subjects were all home care beneficiaries who applied for integrated home care services from October 2021 to December 15, 2021 and completed a comprehensive needs assessment at 11 institutions participating in the Integrated Home Care Service Pilot Project II using convenience sampling. Eleven institutions are located in Seoul, Gyeonggi-do, Gangwon-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Busan, Jeju-do, Chungcheongnam-do, and Jeollabuk-do. A total of 314 home care beneficiaries completed a needs assessment at each institution. Of these, 311 were included in the final analysis, after excluding three participants whose height and weight could not be measured because they were bedridden. Of the 311 participants, there were 203 older adults with dementia, and 108 had no dementia. 3. Data collection This study used data from the “Evaluation of the integrated care model in community care settings under Korean long term care insurance system” [ 18 4. Survey instruments The survey instrument used was a needs assessment record for the comprehensive evaluation of home care beneficiaries collected in the “Evaluation of the integrated care model in community care settings under Korean long term care insurance system” [ 18 The general characteristic variables included sex, age, long-term care grade, education level, household type, comorbidities, daily living patterns, and falls. Sex was coded as “male = 0,” “female = 1,” and age was categorized as “under 75 = 0,” “75 to under 85 = 1,” “85 and over = 2.” Long-term care grade was categorized as “grade 1–2 = 1,” “grade 3 = 2,” “grade 4 = 3,” “grade 5 = 4,” and education level was categorized as “less than elementary school graduation = 0,” “elementary school graduation to less than middle school graduation = 1,” “middle school graduation to less than high school graduation = 2,” “high school graduation or higher = 3.” Household type was categorized as “living with family (living with children or other family members) = 1,” “elderly couple (living with spouse) = 2,” “living alone = 3.” Comorbidities such as stroke (cerebral infarction), Parkinson’s disease, depression, hypertension, and diabetes were coded as “absent = 0,” “present = 1.” Daily living patterns were categorized as “spends most of the day in bed or lying down = 1,” “spends most of the day sitting = 2,” and “lives while engaging in appropriate activities = 3.” Fall experience in the past 3 months was coded as “no = 0” and “yes = 1.” Nutritional status was assessed using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) score. The Korean version of the MNA, developed by the Swiss Nestlé Research Institute and the University Hospital of Tours, France, was translated by Lee [ 19 Functional status variables included Korean Activities of Daily Living (K-ADL), Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL), Korean Mini Mental State Examination-2 (K-MMSE-2), Short Form of Geriatric Depression Scale-Korean version (SGDS-K), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores. The K-ADL tool developed by Won et al 20 et al 21 et al 22 et al 23 24 et al 25 26 Health status variables included the number of medications taken, number of nursing treatments, medical use in the past 3 months, and subjective health status. The number of medications taken was the total number of medications (prescription and over-the-counter drugs) taken in the past 3 days, excluding medications taken without a doctor’s prescription. The number of nursing treatments was calculated by assigning “not provided = 0” and “provided = 1” for 12 items, including tracheostomy care, suctioning, oxygen therapy, pressure ulcer care, tube feeding, pain management, urinary management, ostomy care, dialysis care, diabetic foot care, enema, and insulin therapy [ 27 28 5. Statistical analysis First, a descriptive statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation to understand the socio-demographic characteristics, health, functional status, and nutritional status of the study participants. Second, independent t RESULTS 1. General characteristics and nutritional status This study analyzed the nutritional status of 311 participants categorized into older adults with dementia (n = 203) and without dementia (n = 108) ( Table 1 The prevalence of malnutrition was higher among female in both groups (38.6% in those with dementia and 28.1% in those without dementia); however, this difference was only statistically significant in the dementia group ( P P P P P P P In terms of family structure, those living with their families had the highest malnutrition rates in both groups (47.9% and 28.1%, respectively); however, this was statistically significant only in the dementia group ( P P P 2.

Factors associated with malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults with and without dementia Logistic regression model ( Table 3 P P P P P DISCUSSION This study aimed to examine the nutritional status and associated factors among community-dwelling older adults with and without dementia who are recipients of LTCI to provide foundational data for developing nutritional management policies for home care recipients. The study findings revealed that 33.5% of elderly individuals with dementia and 26.9% of those without dementia who received long-term care in community settings were malnourished. While the paucity of domestic research reporting malnutrition rates based on dementia status renders comparative discussions challenging, our findings and those of other studies underscore the critical need for nutritional management among long-term care recipients residing in communities. Yoon et al 16 29 et al 15 Multivariate analysis showed that household composition, activities of daily living (ADL), and neuropsychiatric symptoms were significantly associated with malnutrition among older adults with dementia. For those without dementia, ADL and depression were significant factors. These findings corroborate with those of previous domestic and international studies [ 3 4 7 14 30 31 32 33 While household composition was not identified as a relevant factor for the non-dementia-afflicted elderly, the finding of this study that elderly individuals with dementia living with family members, such as sons or daughters, have a significantly higher risk of malnutrition (3.81-fold higher) than those living alone warrants careful consideration. This result contrasts with the findings of Yim & Lee [ 34 35 5 3 3 36 37 In contrast to previous studies [ 7 34 Furthermore, our study found no statistically significant associations between malnutrition and disease characteristics, medical service utilization, or subjective health status in community-dwelling older adults with or without dementia. While the limited domestic research renders it challenging to fully discuss these findings, our results differ from those of a previous study [ 30 3 14 Based on these research findings, we propose the following policy recommendations for the nutritional management of community-dwelling older adults with and without dementia who are receiving LTCI: First, we incorporate systematic nutritional assessment and management into long-term care planning for home care recipients, along with evaluations of physical function, emotional state, and cognitive function. Given the high rates of malnutrition in both the dementia and non-dementia groups, nutrition should be considered a core aspect of care, regardless of dementia status. Although current evaluations of home care institutions encourage annual needs assessments, including nutritional status [ 38 Second, it is necessary to consider placing nutrition management specialists in home care institutions. Currently, in these institutions, there are no mandatory staffing requirements for dietitians. Kwon et al 39 40 41 In 2023, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety established 68 Social Welfare Meal Service Management Support Centers nationwide following the implementation of the “Act on Supporting Meal Safety in Social Welfare Facilities” and plans to expand them to all local districts by 2026. It is recommended that a system be created in which home-based long-term care institutions can provide professional meal and nutrition management services through the support and collaboration of Social Welfare Meal Service Management Support Centers installed at the district level, even if dietitians are not on site. Third, developing new services for nutritional management of home care recipients is necessary. Currently, there are no dedicated benefits related to meals or nutrition for home care recipients in the LTCI system. Consequently, the 2022 Long-Term Care Survey [ 10 42 16 43 Fourth, it is necessary to establish a system that allows LTCI recipients to access nutrition-related community health and welfare services. Current elderly care services provide meal management as part of daily life support services, and free meal services are available for low-income, homebound elderly individuals at risk of skipping meals [ 35 Limitation This study has some limitations. First, as the study was conducted on recipients registered in the Integrated Home Care Service Pilot Project II using non-random sampling, the generalizability of the results remains limited. Second, the study did not include variables related to oral health, mastication, or swallowing, which are closely linked to the nutritional status of LTCI recipients. Addressing malnutrition in older adults receiving LTCI is essential for maintaining their health and functional status, as well as for ensuring the sustainability of the LTCI system. Future research should utilize representative sampling designs and include a wider range of variables to identify the factors associated with malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults receiving LTCI. Conclusion This study highlights the need for nutritional management among community-dwelling older adults receiving LTCI services regardless of their dementia status. Based on the research findings, we propose the following recommendations: inclusion of nutritional management as a core component in the case management for LTCI home care recipients, placement of nutrition management specialists within home care institutions or establishment of linkages with social welfare meal management support centers, development of new LTCI services dedicated to meal and nutrition management, and establishment of systems enabling LTCI home care recipients to access community health and welfare services focused on nutrition.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST There are no financial or other issues that might lead to a conflict of interest.  FUNDING None.
