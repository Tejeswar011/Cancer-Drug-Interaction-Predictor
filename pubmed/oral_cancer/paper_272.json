This study aimed to investigate trends in perioperative non-opioid analgesic administration and associated adverse effects in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery at a tertiary hospital. Methods Prescription data for acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were retrospectively collected from January 2020 to December 2024. Actual administration was assessed at three perioperative phases preemptive, intraoperative, and postoperative (postoperative day [POD] 0–3). The study period was divided into 20 quarters. Trends of administration rates over time were analyzed using a linear regression model. Postoperative drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and acute kidney injury (AKI) were evaluated, and Poisson regression was applied to adjust for covariates within each quarter. Results A total of 24,688 surgical cases involving 24,084 patients were analyzed. The administration rate of acetaminophen exhibited a significant upward trend throughout the study from the preemptive phase to POD 2. NSAID administration increased significantly, mainly up to POD 1, though the overall magnitude of the increase was modest. Postoperatively, less than 5% of patients received both analgesic classes concurrently. The analgesic administration rate was not significantly associated with DILI or AKI. Conclusions The use of non-opioid analgesics for major abdominal surgery has increased significantly over the past 5 years. However, their overall utilization, particularly postoperatively, remains limited. Further efforts are required to promote their broader integration into clinical practice.

The recent multisociety consensus statement advocates for their routine use at all pain levels, administered on a fixed schedule when no contraindications exist [ 5 6 Despite their well-established benefits, non-opioid analgesics are not widely used in clinical practice. Efforts by the University of California, San Francisco, to address these challenges provide valuable insights. Their first quality improvement study demonstrated a significant increase in multimodal analgesia use, rising from 53.9% to 67.5% [ 7 7 8 9 9 Given this context, this study aimed to examine trends in the perioperative administration of non-opioid analgesics over the past 5 years in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery at a single tertiary hospital. Since April 2020, the authors have begun routinely administering non-opioid analgesics as part of their institutional anesthesia protocol. Throughout the study period, the perioperative use of non-opioid analgesics was progressively expanded through continued education and engagement with other clinical departments. Additionally, the aim was to investigate whether the increased use of these non-opioid analgesics was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). MATERIALS AND METHODS 1. Study design and ethics This single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Data Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB no. H-2502-108-1614). The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective design, which did not involve identifiable patient data. This study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines [ 10 2. Study cohort Medical records of adult patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia from January 2020 to December 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. The study cohort included patients whose primary surgeries were performed by the departments of gastric surgery, colorectal surgery, hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgery, gynecology, or urology, and who underwent major abdominal surgeries. A major abdominal surgery was defined based on specific surgical procedures selected by the investigators ( Supplementary Table 1 11 3. Data collection and variables All data used in this study were obtained from the Seoul National University Hospital, the hospital’s clinical data warehouse. Baseline characteristics included age, sex, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status. Surgery-related variables encompassed the surgery date, surgical procedure, and primary surgical department, and intraoperative variables included anesthesia duration, red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and continuous vasopressor infusion (phenylephrine or norepinephrine). To evaluate the potential impact of analgesic use on postoperative renal and hepatic function, serum creatinine levels and liver function markers—alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin—were collected from 90 days before surgery through 1 week postoperatively. The postoperative length of hospital stay was determined based on the time between surgery and discharge. Analgesic prescription data were collected from the day of surgery through the POD 3. Based on prescription records, medications containing acetaminophen or NSAIDs were identified, with NSAIDs further classified into non-selective NSAIDs and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors ( Supplementary Table 2 pro re nata; Additionally, the incidence of postoperative complications potentially associated with analgesic use was evaluated. DILI was identified based on peak postoperative liver function test values up to POD 7 to assess postoperative hepatic dysfunction. According to a previous study, DILI was defined as follows: (1) ALT levels exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), (2) ALP levels exceeding twice the ULN, or (3) ALT levels exceeding 3 times the ULN combined with total bilirubin levels exceeding twice the ULN [ 12 13 The primary outcome of this study was the trend of analgesic administration rates, defined as the proportion of surgeries in which each class of analgesics was administered. The entire study period from 2020 to 2024 was divided into 20 calendar quarters (every 3-month intervals) to calculate these rates. For each quarter, the total number of surgeries served as the denominator, and the number of surgeries in which a specific analgesic class was administered served as the numerator. These administration rates were calculated separately for each analgesic class and time point ( e.g. Secondary outcomes included the following: the trends in analgesic administration rates across different surgical departments; the trend in administration rates of rescue medications in the PACU; the number of non-opioid analgesic classes administered from the day of surgery to POD 3; and the incidence of postoperative DILI and AKI. 4. Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics, surgery-related variables, intraoperative variables, and postoperative outcomes are summarized as medians with interquartile ranges for continuous variables and as numbers with percentages for categorical variables. The trends of analgesic administration rates are presented with line plots. To assess the administration rate changes, a simple linear regression of the administration rates was performed between the first and the last quarters. This approach was adopted based on consultation with a statistical expert from the Medical Research Collaborating Center of the authors’ institution during the revision process, as the data of this study did not meet the assumptions of linearity or independence required for applying linear regression across the entire study period. In addition, a two-sample proportion test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference in administration rates between the first and last quarters. To account for multiple comparisons (6 time points of acetaminophen, 5 time points of non-selective NSAIDs, and 5 time points of selective COX-2 inhibitors; n = 16), statistical significance was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction, resulting in a threshold of P To evaluate the multimodal use of non-opioid analgesics, the number of non-opioid analgesic classes administered preemptively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively were analyzed in patients hospitalized from POD 0 to 3. Since non-selective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors are not used concurrently, NSAIDs were categorized as a single class. Additionally, the proportion of the number of analgesic classes administered relative to the total number of cases was calculated at each time point, and the trend in the proportion of cases receiving both acetaminophen and NSAIDs was visualized. Certain procedures and patients with preoperative hepatic or renal dysfunction were excluded from the analysis to minimize the impact of surgical type on postoperative complication rates. For DILI, patients who underwent liver resection, radical cholecystectomy, or extended cholecystectomy and had a preoperative ALT level ≥ 80 U/L were excluded. For AKI, the authors excluded patients who underwent nephrectomy or nephroureterectomy and had a preoperative serum creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dL. Patients were also excluded if they lacked preoperative (within 90 days before surgery) or postoperative creatinine or liver function test results. Poisson regression analysis was then performed to assess the effect of analgesic administration rates on the incidence of postoperative DILI or AKI, adjusted for potential confounders. This method was chosen to reduce indication bias that can arise in patient-level logistic regression, where non-opioid analgesic use might be selectively restricted in patients with some degree of risk. Furthermore, analgesic administration patterns can vary not only by surgical department but also over time, reflecting protocol changes or evolving clinical practices, thereby introducing additional confounding factors. Furthermore, analgesic administration patterns can vary over time due to protocol changes or evolving clinical practices, thereby introducing additional confounding factors. By contrast, Poisson regression at the aggregate level minimizes such biases by modeling exposure independently of individual clinical decisions, allowing for the consideration of temporal or institutional changes in practice. First, for each surgical case, it was determined whether each analgesic class was administered at least once from the preoperative phase through POD 3. The entire data set was grouped into 20 calendar quarters and further stratified based on categorical variables including sex, ASA physical status (I, II, or ≥ III), surgical department (general surgery, gynecology, or urology), intraoperative RBC transfusion, and intraoperative vasopressor infusion. For each stratified group, the mean values of continuous variables (age and duration of anesthesia), the proportion of cases with analgesic administration, and the incidence of each complication were calculated. A Poisson regression model was constructed with the incidence of postoperative DILI or AKI as the outcome, the aforementioned variables as covariates, and the number of operations in each stratified subgroup as the offset. Using the number of operations as an offset enabled the estimation of complication rates per subgroup, accounting for differences in subgroup sizes across quarters and the stratification variables. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.3.1), with statistical significance set at P RESULTS Of the 25,885 eligible surgical cases, 1,197 were excluded based on the exclusion criteria, leaving 24,688 surgical cases performed on 24,084 patients for analysis ( Fig. 1 Supplementary Table 3 14 1.

Trend of postoperative complications Trends in postoperative complications over the study period are shown in Fig. 5 Table 1 P P P DISCUSSION This study showed a significant increase in the use of acetaminophen and NSAIDs among patients who underwent major abdominal surgery at the authors’ institution over the past 5 years. This increase was most pronounced intraoperatively, whereas postoperative use has risen more markedly in recent years. The proportion of cases administered with perioperative acetaminophen and NSAIDs was not significantly associated with the incidence of postoperative AKI or DILI. To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to examine trends in non-opioid analgesic use among surgical patients in South Korea. These findings highlight the necessity of expanding the use of non-opioid analgesics as part of ongoing efforts to reduce opioid consumption and enhance postoperative pain management. Several large-scale studies have examined trends in non-opioid analgesic use among surgical patients. An analysis of the United States Premier research database (2007–2017) revealed that, despite the opioid crisis, opioid prescribing remained stable, acetaminophen use slightly increased, and NSAID use remained steady at approximately 37%, suggesting the limited adoption of non-opioid analgesics [ 15 16 17 18 The present study demonstrated an increasing trend in non-opioid analgesic use, particularly for acetaminophen, while NSAID use remained lower than expected. Additionally, significant variations were observed across departments in non-opioid analgesic prescribing patterns. These findings suggest that their use is influenced more by physician preference or departmental protocols than by patient factors or anticipated pain levels. This aligns with previous studies revealing that multimodal analgesia practices are primarily shaped by anesthesiologists, surgical specialties, and institutional protocols rather than patient or procedural characteristics [ 17 19 The authors analyzed the number of non-opioid analgesic classes to assess the proportion of patients receiving multimodal analgesia. While both drug classes are effective for postoperative pain management, their combined use has been shown to provide superior analgesic benefits [ 20 21 5 22 25 16 17 26 27 Finally, the association between the increased use of acetaminophen and NSAIDs and the incidence of postoperative AKI and DILI was examined, as concerns about these adverse effects have been considered key barriers to their broader use. Analysis in the present study revealed no significant association between their use and the occurrence of these complications. The safety of these agents in surgical patients has been well-documented in previous studies [ 28 29 30 31 32 Despite the efforts of the authors, this study has limitations, which should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, as a single-center study, the generalizability of the results may be limited. Second, the authors did not directly assess the impact of increased non-opioid analgesic use on postoperative pain relief. This was primarily due to the lack of reliable documentation on postoperative pain intensity and opioid consumption. However, given that the efficacy of non-opioid analgesics in postoperative pain management is well-established, the authors did not deem reassessing this aspect essential to the study objectives. Finally, although the incidence of AKI and DILI was investigated and adjusted for several known risk factors, the analysis was not comprehensive, and more detailed evaluations were not conducted. Moreover, while acetaminophen and NSAID use exhibited an increasing trend, the relatively modest and recent increase in their postoperative use likely had a limited impact on the incidence of AKI and DILI. In conclusion, the authors’ findings demonstrated an increasing trend in non-opioid analgesic use among patients undergoing abdominal surgery at their institution over the past 5 years. However, overall utilization rates, particularly in the postoperative period, remained low. Additionally, the rate of non-opioid analgesic use was not significantly associated with the incidence of postoperative AKI or DILI. These results highlight the need for continued efforts to expand the routine use of non-opioid analgesics within multimodal analgesia strategies. This expansion should be supported by evidence-based institutional protocols and close collaboration between surgical and anesthesia teams to enhance postoperative pain management.
