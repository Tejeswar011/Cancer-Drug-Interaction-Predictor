Microalgae are among the most promising microbial platforms for the construction of photosynthetic cell factories, while the current industrial-scale cultivation of microalgae remains predominantly dependent on traditional liquid submerged systems, imposing limitations on commercial viability due to both process and economic constraints. Encapsulation of microalgae within bioactive matrices combined with 3D bioprinting to fabricate customized structures has been explored to address the limitations of submerged cultivation, which are expected to expand microalgal applications and establish new research directions in microalgal biotechnology. This review analyzes both matrices and methods of 3D bioprinting, summarizing the advancement of microalgae-based 3D bioprinting into six main domains including living building materials, biophotovoltaics, photosynthetic biosynthesis, bioremediation, tissue engineering, and food engineering. Lastly, synthetic biology-informed perspectives are provided on future developments of 3D bioprinting technologies and their potential in microalgal research. 3D bioprinting microalgae engineered living materials spatially customized structure National Key Research and Development Program of China 2021YFA0909700 National Natural Science Foundation of China 32270103 32271484 Shandong Taishan Scholarship This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant number 2021YFA0909700), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant numbers 32270103, 32271484), and the Shandong Taishan Scholarship (to X.L. and G.L.). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Three-dimensional (3D) printing, formally known as additive manufacturing (AM), demonstrates a fabrication by constructing objects through layer by layer deposition of printing substrates. This technology transforms computer-aided design (CAD) models into physical entities through a systematic process involving three key steps: digital model segmentation (“slicing”) into printable layers, material deposition guided by sliced data, and sequential layer fusion to form final three-dimensional structures [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Microalgae are a group of photoautotrophic microorganisms encompassing both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, exhibiting remarkable adaptability across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 The capacity of 3D bioprinting to fabricate customized three-dimensional structures addresses the specific physiological requirements of diverse cellular systems, enabling precise regulation of scaffold morphology and microenvironmental parameters to optimize biological functions [ 18 19 Figure 1 20 21 22 Specifically, microalgae-immobilizing biomaterials were defined as microalgae-based engineered living materials (MB-ELMs), which enable the construction of species-specific cultivation systems through strategic incorporation of photosynthetic cells within tailored matrices. Beyond basic immobilization, spatial patterning emerges as a critical field in biomaterial science [ 25 26 27 2. History and Progress of Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting In 2015, Gelinsky’s group pioneered the development of microalgae-laden hydrogel scaffolds via 3D bioprinting. Lode et al. employed multi-nozzle 3D printing to co-encapsulate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 28 C. reinhardtii Chlorella sorokiniana −1 29 Chlorella vulgaris 30 Section 4 An analysis of the existing studies reveals that microalgae-based 3D bioprinting technology has undergone an evolutionary trajectory from fundamental biocompatibility verification to functionalized system integration. This review categorizes this evolutionary process into three distinct phases: foundational forming, functional development, and intelligent systems. During the foundational forming stage, the key technological challenge involved validating microalgal viability under shear stress conditions, though long-term stability of embedded microalgae remained problematic. The functional development phase primarily focused on formulating novel bioinks designed to enhance and confer specific properties to microalgae. Transitioning to the intelligent systems stage, research emphasis shifted toward self-responsive materials, where genetically engineered microalgae enabled environmentally adaptive structural transitions and specialized functionalities. Microalgae-based 3D bioprinting presents a viable solution addressing the spatial inefficiency intrinsic to conventional microalgae cultivation methods. Moreover, 3D-printed MB-ELMs exhibit dual capabilities of carbon sequestration and autonomous growth, positioning them as promising candidates for developing carbon-neutral material systems. While 3D bioprinting of microalgae shows considerable application potential, the overall research remains confined to laboratory-scale studies. Key challenges that need to be addressed are discussed in detail in Section 5.2 Beyond living cell application, emerging research explores 3D printing utilization of microalgal biomass [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 3. Crucial Technical Components of Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting 3.1. Matrices of Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting Hydrogel systems constitute the principal matrix platform for microalgae-based 3D bioprinting, with alginate, starch, and carrageenan emerging as predominant choices due to the structural adaptability and biological compatibility [ 39 40 C. reinhardtii 41 2 2 42 43 44 Despite these advantages, hydrogel-based MB-ELMs face two critical limitations: compromised mechanical integrity and finite functional durability. The inherent viscoelastic properties of hydrogels restrict the load-bearing applications, while reversible ionic crosslinking in physiological environments permits gradual microalgal leakage from alginate matrices [ 45 46 G 47 48 49 Alternative material systems are being investigated to address hydrogel limitations. Pozzobon et al. conducted cytotoxic screening of common 3D printing polymers (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, ABS; Polycarbonate Blend, PC-Blend; Polylactic Acid, PLA; Acrylate Resin) on Chlorella vulgaris 50 Platymonas 51 8 8 G Bacillus Chlorella 52 3.2. Methods of Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting Three-dimensional bioprinting enables precise architectural customization of scaffolds to accommodate species-specific microalgal requirements and functional objectives. This technology further permits functional modification of bioinks during MB-ELM fabrication to optimize microenvironmental conditions for cellular proliferation [ 53 54 55 56 Table 1 3.2.1. Extrusion-Based Bioprinting Extrusion-based bioprinting, the most widely adopted method for microalgae-based systems, employs viscous bioinks containing living cells. Pre-prepared bioink is stored in the printer and mechanically extruded through a nozzle onto a printing platform ( Figure 2 63 7 64 The accessibility of extrusion-based bioprinting, requiring relatively simple equipment and biomaterials, has driven its predominance in current research. Balasubramanian et al. demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by developing recyclable C. reinhardtii 41 65 3.2.2. Light-Projection-Based Bioprinting Light-projection-based bioprinting utilizes photosensitive materials exposed to UV light patterns for layer-by-layer polymerization, enabling extremely high resolution (<50 μm). During printing, the platform is submerged in a photopolymerization resin, and a digital light projector selectively cures the material according to predefined 3D models ( Figure 2 66 67 Despite these advantages, the technology faces material-specific challenges. Photopolymerizable resins must maintain biocompatibility while supporting microalgal growth, and prolonged UV exposure during multilayer printing may compromise cell viability. Wangpraseurt et al. replicated coral tissue microstructures using light-projection printing, achieving microalgae densities of 10 9 66 3.2.3. Inkjet-Based Bioprinting Inkjet-based printing operates on a non-contact principle, depositing bioink droplets onto predetermined locations through piezoelectric or thermal actuators ( Figure 2 68 However, inkjet-based printing struggles with low cell-loading capacity. Furthermore, post-printing steps such as chemical or photopolymerization pose challenges for maintaining cell viability. Sawa et al. demonstrated the functional potential of this approach by printing Synechocystis 69 4. Application of Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting The strategic integration of microalgae within three dimensional scaffolds via 3D bioprinting creates favorable conditions for optimal light penetration and nutrient distribution, effectively sustaining the viability and metabolic functions of immobilized microalgae over extended periods. This advanced manufacturing technique substantially broadens the application scope of microalgae-loaded scaffolds across multiple disciplines [ 53 70 4.1. Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting in Living Building Materials 4.1.1. Living Building Materials The escalating global carbon crisis has intensified demand for innovative carbon mitigation strategies, with microalgae-based systems emerging as potent solutions due to the superior photosynthetic efficiency and carbon sequestration capacities [ 71 72 73 3 74 3 Figure 3 4.1.2. Three-Dimensional-Bioprinting-Enabled LBMs Current research focuses on optimizing the mechanical performance of microalgae-based LBMs, which currently exhibit lower tensile strength compared to conventional concrete. A promising strategy involves augmenting CaCO 3 2 75 Synechococcus 76 Synechococcus 77 synechococcus The advent of 3D bioprinting addresses critical challenges in urban construction by enabling rapid prototyping of structurally optimized, algae-integrated architectures. Reinhardt et al. engineered a bio-concrete through extrusion-based bioprinting of Synechococcus 78 Synechococcus 2 2 47 4.1.3. Future Perspectives of 3D-Bioprinting-Enabled LBMs Microalgae-based LBMs are envisioned not merely as structural components but as functional elements that transform buildings from carbon-emission elements into environmental modulators. Integrating microalgae LBM into non-load-bearing architectural sections could offset partial carbon emissions. While current research prioritizes the elucidation of biomineralization mechanisms, bioprinting optimization, and process parameter refinement, several critical barriers impede practical implementation, including the following: (1) achieving spatiotemporal control over mineralization uniformity and kinetics to ensure structural consistency; (2) synchronizing biological processes with printing parameters for dimensional accuracy; (3) establishing standard protocols for biosafety and lifecycle cost assessments; and (4) overcoming species-specific variability in mineralization efficiency through targeted strain engineering. Addressing these limitations requires concerted efforts in three domains: fundamental studies of biomineralization regulatory networks, technological integration of additive manufacturing with biological systems, and the development of scalable production workflows for industrial adoption. 4.2. Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting in Biophotovoltaic System 4.2.1. Biophotovoltaic System The development of sustainable energy infrastructure represents one of humanity’s most pressing technological challenges. With solar irradiance reaching the Earth’s surface annually surpassing global energy demands by four orders of magnitude, solar energy conversion has emerged as a critical scientific field [ 79 80 81 80 82 83 4.2.2. Strategies of 3D-Bioprinting-Enabled Biophotovoltaic Systems Fabrication of 3D-Printed Electrodes Current limitations in electron transfer efficiency within conventional BPV devices primarily stem from suboptimal photoelectron harvesting at biotic–abiotic interfaces. Hierarchical nano-porous electrode designs address this challenge through enhanced interfacial charge transfer ( Figure 4 Synechocystis 2 84 Anabaena 85 Fabrication of Bioprinted Microalgal Composite Sawa et al. engineered an inkjet-printed bioanode through direct deposition of PCC 6803 onto carbon nanomaterials, subsequently laminating hydrogel electrolytes to construct integrated BPV devices. The dual-function hydrogel matrix served as both an ionic conductor and nutrient delivery system, sustaining continuous current generation for more than 100 operational hours [ 69 Shewanella oneidensis 2 2 86 4.2.3. Future Perspectives of 3D-Bioprinting-Enabled BPV System Bioprinting implementation in microalgal BPV systems enables spatial organization and microenvironmental customization. Precision deposition of microalgae into columnar or stratified architectures maximizes photon utilization through uniform irradiance distribution, effectively mitigating photosynthetic inefficiencies caused by cellular self-shading. Simultaneous integration of cells into conductive matrices minimizes electron transfer distances at biotic–abiotic junctions, significantly reducing energy dissipation. A critical distinction from other bioprinting applications lies in essential requirement for multifunctional bioinks combining cytocompatibility, mechanical durability, and electrical conductivity—a substantial challenge given the inherently insulative nature of hydrogel matrices. Future matrix innovations will likely focus on nanocomposite formulations incorporating carbon nanomaterials or metallic dopants to achieve optimal bioelectronic interfaces performance. 4.3. Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting in Photosynthetic Biosynthesis 4.3.1. Photosynthetic Biosynthesis Microorganism-mediated biosynthesis has established itself as a cornerstone technology for producing bioactive macromolecules. Within this domain, microalgae have emerged as particularly promising cellular platforms for synthesizing high-value compounds ranging from renewable fuels to specialty carbohydrates. The engineering of advanced microalgal cell factories currently represents a pivotal research trajectory in microalgal biotechnology [ 87 88 89 Figure 5 90 91 4.3.2. Three-Dimensional-Bioprinting-Enabled Photosynthetic Biosynthesis The immobilized cultivation framework represents a promising methodology for industrial implementation [ 92 91 Synechocystis −1 −2 −1 C. reinhardtii G G −1 46 4.3.3. Future Perspectives of 3D-Bioprinting-Enabled Photosynthetic Biosynthesis Three-dimensional-bioprinting-enabled photosynthetic biosynthesis demonstrates great potential in sustainable cell factory development through spatially optimized and mass-transfer-enhanced cellular scaffolds, achieving precise control over microbial spatial organization and microenvironmental parameters, significantly augmenting production efficiency [ 27 4.4. Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting in Bioremediation 4.4.1. Bioremediation Anthropogenic emissions of heavy metals, organic pollutants, and greenhouse gases from rapid industrialization have created critical environmental burdens requiring urgent remediation solutions [ 93 94 95 Figure 6 4.4.2. Strategies of 3D-Bioprinting-Enabled Bioremediation Construction of Synergistic Microbial Consortia Jiang et al. developed retrievable microalgae hydrogel networks (MHNs) by confining living Chlorella zofingiensise 96 Chlorella vulgaris-Bacillus subtilis 2 52 C. vulgaris B. subtilis 97 C. vulgaris B. subtilis 98 Intelligent Environmental Responsiveness Advanced bioprinting enables the creation of stimulus-responsive bioremediation systems through synthetic biology integration. Datta et al. engineered riboswitch-mediated genetic circuits in Synechococcus elongatus 99 4.4.3. Future Perspectives of 3D-Bioprinting-Enabled Bioremediation Real-world contamination scenarios present complex multipollutant interactions that current single-contaminant studies inadequately address. Industrial effluents and contaminated soils frequently contain synergistic pollutant mixtures that complicate remediation kinetics and strain selection. Future research priorities could encompass the following: (1) mechanistic understanding of cross-contaminant interactions; (2) optimization of algal–bacterial consortia for complex matrices; (3) spatiotemporal orchestration of microbial consortia through 3D bioprinting. The technology’s capacity for controlling spatial patterning offers particular microbial community architectures, enabling targeted pollutant degradation cascades. Current limitations in handling multicomponent contamination systems necessitate development of intelligent scaffolds with real-time environmental sensing and adaptive metabolic responses. Bridging laboratory-scale innovations to field applications will require multidisciplinary integration of synthetic biology, materials science, and environmental engineering to achieve robust, scalable bioremediation solutions. 4.5. Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting in Tissue Engineering 4.5.1. Tissue Engineering The convergence of bioprinting technology with tissue engineering has catalyzed a novel research paradigm in microorganism-driven biomaterial innovation [ 53 100 101 102 103 104 4.5.2. Three-Dimensional-Bioprinting-Enabled Tissue Engineering Lode et al. pioneered extrusion-based bioprinting of C. reinhardtii 28 105 C. reinhardtii 106 Clinical translation potential emerges in hypoxic tissue regeneration models. Wang et al. developed microfluidic-assisted in situ bioprinting of Chlorella pyrenoidosa 107 Chlorella zofingiensis Bacillus subtilis B. subtilis 108 4.5.3. Future Perspectives of 3D-Bioprinting-Enabled Tissue Engineering While 3D bioprinting microalgal systems show promise in addressing superficial hypoxia, deeper tissue construction demands sophisticated oxygen gradient engineering [ 109 110 111 4.6. Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting in Food Engineering 4.6.1. Three-Dimensional Printing-Enabled Food Engineering Microalgae, renowned for the diverse components—including functional proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and essential minerals—serve as nutrient-dense functional ingredients in the development of health-promoting foods [ 112 113 114 115 4.6.2. Three-Dimensional-Bioprinting-Enabled Food Engineering Living Microalgae System Liu et al. developed a biogenic microalgae-laden hydrogel (BMH) system via 3D-printing of alginate/carrageenan matrices encapsulating live microalgae. This architecture optimizes spatial light and CO 2 116 Microalgal Biomass Post-processed microalgal biomass expands opportunities for functional food design. Microalgal biomass is used as an additive for 3D-printed food for improving functionalities of food. Uribe-Wandurraga et al. improved dough printability and thermal stability by incorporating freeze-dried microalgae, demonstrating its utility as a precursor for 3D-printed cookies [ 36 37 38 35 31 4.6.3. Future Perspectives of 3D-Bioprinting-Enabled Food Engineering Despite this potential, critical challenges hinder commercial translation. Inherent marine-like and bitter flavor profiles reduce consumer acceptance. Textural constraints arise from the fibrous nature of algal materials, complicating meat analogue simulation and complex texture fabrication. Technical hurdles include optimizing bioink rheology for printability, ensuring post-processing edibility, and managing equipment costs, particularly for food-grade devices requiring stringent hygiene compliance. 5. Prospects 5.1. The Future of 3D Bioprinting Technology Extrusion-based bioprinting remains the most widely adopted approach due to its equipment simplicity, broad material compatibility, and capability for constructing complex structures. However, its technological progression is constrained by inherent limitations in resolution and time-intensive fabrication processes. Ligh-projection-based bioprinting has emerged as a high-precision alternative, enabling the fabrication of intricate microstructures through photopolymerization. Despite these advantages, technical complexities in multi-material integration and photopolymerization-induced cellular stress restrict its practical implementation. Inkjet-based bioprinting offers rapid fabrication speeds and high-resolution patterning capabilities, though material viscosity constraints and geometric complexity limitations persist. Microalgae-based 3D bioprinting represents an interdisciplinary field combining microbiology, advanced materials science, and additive manufacturing. This technology enables precise spatial organization of microalgae-material interactions while allowing material innovations to enhance biological functionality. However, the field remains in its developmental phase, facing three primary challenges: (1) optimization of bioinks balancing printability with cellular viability, (2) development of application-specific fabrication protocols, and (3) cost of 3D bioprinting. One of greatest challenges in 3D bioprinting technology lies in bioink material constraints. The available range of printable biocompatible materials suitable for biomedical applications remains relatively limited. To advance microalgae-based relevant research, there is a pressing need for functional bioinks that can properly support microalgal growth and structural integrity post-printing. Currently, many existing biomaterials are not ideal for particular applications due to insufficient biocompatibility, poor printability, or inability to maintain long-term stability in physiological environments. Addressing these limitations requires focused research on developing novel biocompatible materials that are simultaneously printable, structurally stable, and conducive to cell viability. Furthermore, extensive research into optimizing material formulation parameters is essential to push the field forward. The second key challenge lies in the development of application-specific fabrication protocols. The utility of printed structures largely depends on the printing methodology employed. Developing printing strategies distinct from conventional bioprinting approaches to address diverse application scenarios will be a critical focus for future research. Recent innovations in multi-material integration capabilities and adaptive precision control architectures have demonstrated potential pathways. Notably, Zhang et al. developed an integrated bioprinting platform combining spatiotemporal microenvironment modulation with high-fidelity cellular deposition. This advancement exhibits significant potential for overcoming longstanding challenges in vascular network engineering and heterologous tissue fabrication, thereby establishing foundational technologies for next-generation organ manufacturing [ 117 The third key challenge lies in the cost of bioprinting. The global bioprinting technologies market should reach USD 5.0 billion by 2027 from USD 2.4 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 16.2% for the forecast period of 2022 to 2027 [ 118 119 5.2. Microalgae-Based 3D Bioprinting and Synthetic Biology Bioprinting technology has illustrated a promising research paradigm in microalgae applications, positioning these photosynthetic organisms as pivotal components in synthetic biology frameworks. Amid escalating global crises including resource depletion, ecological degradation, and climate disruption, synthetic biological innovations emerge as promising solutions for reconciling socioeconomic development with ecological sustainability. Current implementations already demonstrate proven success across diverse domains such as medical therapeutics, renewable energy systems, advanced biomaterials, and sustainable agriculture, effectively challenging conventional production methodologies. The strategic convergence of microalgae biotechnology with 3D bioprinting platforms significantly amplifies functional potential of microalgae in bio-architectural design, photobioelectrochemical systems, regenerative medicine, and environmental remediation. This synergy fundamentally aligns with synthetic biology’s “bottom-up” engineering paradigm, which employs systematic Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL) cycles to construct programmable biological systems. Microalgae-based bioprinting operationalizes this framework through precise spatial organization of cellular components, enabling the exploration of next-generation materials with paradigm-shifting capabilities. Scientifically, 3D-bioprinted MB-ELMs exhibit inherent adaptive, self-regenerative, and stimulus-responsive characteristics that substantially surpass the performance thresholds of conventional synthetic substrates. The core scientific challenge centers on achieving precise spatiotemporal control over multicellular microenvironments while concurrently orchestrating material macrostructure evolution and dynamic functional modulation. 5.2.1. Printing Microalgal Biomes/Communities Synthetic biology enables the systematic selection or engineering of microbial chassis with tailored functionalities for 3D bioprinting applications. These bioengineered microorganisms are strategically assembled within three-dimensional biocompatible scaffolds that sustain cell viability and metabolic activity, optimizing cellular functionality to create specialized biosystems. Lee et al. engineered photosynthetic leaf-like architectures by immobilizing Chlorella 120 Anabaena 85 66 67 5.2.2. Advancing Microalgae-Based 4D Bioprinting The integration of bioprinting with synthetic biology is poised to catalyze the emergence of 4D bioprinting, an evolutionary leap from static 3D-printed constructs to dynamic biological systems. Unlike conventional 3D printing, 4D bioprinting employs stimulus-responsive biomaterials that enable programmable shape morphogenesis or functional adaptation under specific environmental triggers [ 121 122 123 (1) Intelligent Microalgal Response Systems: Genetic engineering of microalgae could yield chassis strains with tunable environmental sensitivity (e.g., light, humidity, ionic gradients). Coupled with 3D-printed hydrogel matrices, these strains may form adaptive bioreactors capable of structural reconfiguration or gene expression modulation in response to external cues. Such systems could advance applications in precision bioremediation, photosynthetic bioelectronics, and programmable tissue scaffolds. (2) Spatiotemporally Controlled Microbial Consortia: By leveraging 4D bioprinting to position microalgae as primary producers within synthetic microbial ecosystems, interspecies dynamics can be systematically investigated including metabolic cross-feeding, quorum sensing, and horizontal gene transfer. These engineered communities may serve as self-regulating bioreactors, dynamically adjusting the functional outputs (e.g., metabolite production, carbon sequestration) in response to environmental fluctuations. (3) Functionalized Bioprinted Edibles: Safety-certified genetically modified microalgae could be embedded into 4D-printed food matrices to enable targeted physiological effects, such as gut microbiome modulation or immunonutritional enhancement. This application necessitates rigorous optimization of algal viability, nutrient retention, and post-ingestion functionality within gastrointestinal environments. While microalgae-based 4D bioprinting represents a field with great potential, its development faces inherent interdisciplinary challenges. Progress demands synergistic integration of materials science, polymer chemistry, and microbial biotechnology, supported by advanced infrastructure for precision bioprinting and multi-omics characterization. Consequently, the maturation of this field will require sustained interdisciplinary collaboration and incremental technological breakthroughs.

Limitations of submerged cultivation: (I) under high-density cultivation conditions, light is absorbed and scattered by microalgal cells as light penetrates the liquid culture medium. With increasing culture depth and cell density, light intensity exponentially attenuates, impairing photosynthetic efficiency and growth rates of the microalgae [ 23 24 Figure 2 Schematic representations of 3D bioprinting methods. Extrusion-based printing: the bioink is loaded into the bioprinter prior to printing. The printer moves along three-dimensional axes (X, Y, and Z), depositing the bioink onto the printing platform through mechanical extrusion according to a predefined model, resulting in layer-by-layer fabrication. During this process, the extrusion of bioink is continuous. It is noteworthy that cells in the printer experience diminished viability due to compressive mechanical stress. Light-projection-based printing: the printing platform is immersed in a reservoir of bioink, and a light projector selectively solidifies the bioink layer by layer following a predetermined pattern to achieve the desired structure. Inkjet printing: the bioink preloaded into the bioprinter is ejected onto specified locations in accordance with a pre-designed three-dimensional model to facilitate precise construct formation. Figure 3 Schematic representations of 3D-bioprinting-enabled LBMs. Microalgae are capable of CO 2 2 Figure 4 Strategies of 3D-bioprinting-enabled biophotovoltaic systems. Strategy I: the integration of microalgae cells with 3D-printed porous transparent electrodes enhances electron capture efficiency in biophotovoltaic systems, improving biophotovoltaic systems’ power output. Strategy II: diverse spatial patterns of microalgae and electrogenic bacteria encapsulated within bioactive matrices can be controlled by 3D printing. Precise spatial pattern control of microbial consortia improves inter-species electron transfer efficiency, boosting the power output of biophotovoltaic systems. Purple circle figures represent electrogenic bacteria (e.g., Shewanella oneidensis Figure 5 Schematic representations of 3D-bioprinting-enabled photosynthetic biosynthesis. Microalgae immobilized within bioactive matrices harness light energy to sequestrate CO 2 Figure 6 Strategies of 3D-bioprinting-enabled bioremediation. Strategy I: immobilization of microalgae within matrices prevents leakage of microalgae. The bioink of heterogeneous composition enables co-immobilization of microalgae with functional bacteria to construct spatially organized microbial consortia, where the collective functionality of the microbial community facilitates bioremediation. Strategy II: genetic engineering of microalgal cells allows the immobilized cells to respond to environmental signaling molecules. This engineered capability can either trigger specific metabolic pathways to secrete target metabolites or induce programmed cell death when required.
