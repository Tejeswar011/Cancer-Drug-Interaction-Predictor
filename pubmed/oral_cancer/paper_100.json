It is associated with significant morbidity and occurs independent of intestinal disease activity. Inflammation of the trachea and bronchi in inflammatory bowel diseases is typically responsive to corticosteroids or anti‐tumour necrosis factor agents. In this report, we present a case of tracheobronchitis in Crohn's disease presenting with a chronic productive cough while on adalimumab. The diagnosis was made by bronchoscopy, which revealed inflammation of the trachea and main bronchi, with biopsies demonstrating squamous cell metaplasia consistent with pulmonary inflammatory bowel disease. The patient was unable to be weaned off steroids and, in the presence of an elevated fractional expired nitric oxide, dupilumab was trialled, which resulted in minimal improvement in his symptoms. In this report, we present a case of tracheobronchitis in Crohn's disease presenting with a chronic productive cough while on infliximab. The diagnosis was made on bronchoscopy, which revealed inflammation of the trachea and main bronchi, with biopsies demonstrating squamous cell metaplasia consistent with pulmonary inflammatory bowel disease.

The true prevalence of pulmonary manifestations in IBD is unknown but has previously been estimated to be as low as 1%. Inflammation of the large airways is a particularly rare subset, representing just 7%–8% of all pulmonary manifestations [ 1 2 Case Report A 35‐year‐old male presented for outpatient respiratory review following nearly a year of intractable productive cough. His past medical history was significant for CD, which was diagnosed by flexible sigmoidoscopy in 2011, with previous colectomy in 2002. Since diagnosis, the patient has been treated with multiple immunomodulatory drugs, including salazopyrine, methotrexate, adalimumab and ustekinumab, with other extra‐intestinal features including arthritis and skin disease. He has a minimal smoking history (less than one pack year) and no significant environmental or occupational exposures. His cough initially developed following a lower respiratory tract infection with a viral prodrome in June 2021. He reported that while he had fevers and was systemically unwell, he did not need hospitalisation. Following this, he had a persistent cough, productive of thick tenacious sputum varying between clear and creamy yellow to green. Interventions trialled included intranasal corticosteroid sprays, treatment for gastroesophageal reflux, an eight‐week course of low dose azithromycin, and amphotericin lozenges for candidiasis, all with no material improvement in cough or sputum burden. Importantly, his work as a barrister became impacted by the persistent cough. Computed tomography (CT) chest performed a few months following initial presentation demonstrated mild bronchial wall thickening but did not show significant parenchymal disease. His blood tests, including inflammatory markers, were not significantly abnormal. Initial (September 2022) lung function testing demonstrated normal spirometry with no significant bronchodilator response and normal gas transfer (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 A timeline of events during the patient's care. He underwent a bronchoscopy in September 2022, which revealed inflamed mucosa in the trachea and in the main bronchi with white sputum throughout (Figure 2a 2b FIGURE 2 (a) Bronchoscopy image: Demonstrates erythematous and inflamed mucosa with a nodular appearance (A) and mucopurulent secretions (B). (b) Tracheal biopsy from area denoted by arrow on (a): H&E, high power image (×40), showing inflamed and reactive metaplastic (A) squamous epithelium with underlying florid, plasma cell‐rich chronic inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils (B). He was commenced on prednisolone 50 mg daily in October 2022 and had an immediate and significant (> 90%) improvement in sputum burden and reduction in cough frequency. Shortly after commencing steroids, he was switched from adalimumab to ustekinumab in the context of an undetectable adalimumab level in peripheral blood. This had no effect on the patient's symptoms independent of the prednisolone dose. Prednisolone was started at 50 mg daily for 1 week, then reduced by 10 mg reduction each month to 10 mg daily by February 2023. Once below 30 mg daily, there was a recrudescence of cough and sputum burden. The cough remitted again in May 2023 when the patient was treated with a short course of 50 mg of prednisolone for urticaria. In February 2023, at a prednisolone dose of 10 mg daily, the patient was started on inhaled corticosteroids and long‐acting bronchodilators in the form of ciclesonide and budesonide combined with eformoterol (which provided a 20% improvement in his cough) and referred for chest physiotherapy, including sputum clearance techniques. Oral prednisolone was ceased in September 2023. Due to ongoing symptoms, a second bronchoscopy and endobronchial biopsy was performed in October 2023, which yielded similar findings of chronic inflammation as seen in his initial bronchoscopy in September 2022. In December 2023, given a lack of response to several treatments apart from high‐dose prednisolone, he was commenced on dupilumab off‐label under compassionate access following extensive multidisciplinary discussions between respiratory, gastroenterology and rheumatology. Dupilumab was commenced with a loading dose of 400 mg followed by 200 mg fortnightly. At 6 weeks post commencement, there was minimal improvement in symptoms; however, FeNO had fallen to 14 ppb (from 35 ppb). At 6 months, the patient reported no significant improvement in his symptoms, and dupilumab was ceased. There was no significant change in respiratory function tests. 3 Discussion CD is a multi‐system disorder with a number of recognised pulmonary extra‐intestinal manifestations. In this report, we outline a case of CD‐associated tracheobronchitis which presented with a chronic productive cough, elevated FeNO and histological findings of squamous cell metaplasia of the biopsied epithelium. The presence of large airway inflammation despite quiescent CD treated on adalimumab (and subsequently Ustekinumab) is noteworthy, as is the lack of a durable response to inhaled and systemic corticosteroids after weaning, which are typically the mainstay of treatment [ 2 3 Approximately 50% of patients with IBD exhibit lung involvement, as indicated by abnormalities in spirometry and high‐resolution tomographic imaging (HRCT) [ 4 5 6 The pathophysiological basis of the link between the IBDs and airways disease is still largely unknown [ 7 8 7 9 10 9 11 12 13 Overall, the role of biologics in the management of pulmonary manifestations of IBD is yet to be determined, and the literature on this subject is limited to case reports. Hayek et al. summarised the use of infliximab in the management of eight cases of IBD‐associated pulmonary disease, including only one patient with tracheal inflammation, where all patients were responsive to infliximab [ 2 14 15 16 1 TABLE 1 Summary of investigations.
