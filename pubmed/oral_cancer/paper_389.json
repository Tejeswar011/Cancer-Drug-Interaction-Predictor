This study characterized OPC incidence rates (IRs) by subgroups to identify high-risk populations for future screening efforts. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis comprising a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published since 2000 reporting OPC IRs in the US, supplemented by a primary analysis of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. From each source, we extracted cases and person-years to calculate IRs per 100,000 person-years (PY). Data from 11 studies selected for meta-analysis were analyzed using random-effects models. We stratified analyses by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and HIV status, as available. Results The meta-analysis found an overall OPC IR of 8.2 per 100,000 PY. Men had four times the incidence of OPC than women (13.4 and 3.6 per 100,000 PY, respectively). People living with HIV (PLWH) had the highest IR (27.6 per 100,000 PY), particularly men LWH (35.2 per 100,000 PY, compared to 12.4 in women LWH). SEER data confirmed sex differences, with low incidence in men < 50 years and in women of all ages, and a peak IR among men 60–79 years (32.4 per 100,000 PY). Among men aged 60–79, IRs were higher among White, Black, and American Indian/Alaskan Native (25.7–39.6 per 100,000 PY) than Hispanic/Latino or Asian American/Pacific Islander men (8.8–16.7 per 100,000 PY). Conclusions Men aged 50–79 years and PLWH are at highest risk for OPC, with IRs comparable with or exceeding those of other HPV-associated cancers in the US. Any future screening efforts should prioritize these groups while excluding low-risk populations, such as women and individuals < 50 years. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42024588671.

Decreasing tobacco use [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved methods for screening for OPC, and most cases are diagnosed in late stages [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 Given the increasing incidence of OPC [ 4 16 17 18 19 Methods Methods overview We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. While this meta-analysis contained key data, it was limited by the subgroups that each study reported and by the limited number of studies for some subgroups. Therefore, we performed a complementary analysis by leveraging an additional data source (SEER) to estimate OPC incidence for additional subgroups not available in the meta-analysis data. Systematic review with meta-analysis Eligibility criteria We included studies published since January 1, 2000 that reported IRs of OPC in US populations, as well as the corresponding number of person-years and cases. We defined OPC according to the site and histology ICD-O-3 codes adopted by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention [ 20 Information sources and search strategy We searched Medline, PubMed Central (PMC), and BookShelf via PubMed on September 20, 2024. Our search query (Additional file 1) included controlled-vocabular and free-text terms related to IR, OPC, and US. Study selection Two reviewers independently screened all titles for inclusion in the abstract stage of review, and then independently screened the abstracts of all relevant titles. Next, the two reviewers independently screened potentially eligible full-text articles, including supplemental data. Articles that presented IRs only within figures were excluded. At all stages, discrepancies were resolved through discussion. Data extraction One reviewer extracted the data, and a second reviewer independently confirmed the extracted data. We extracted data pertaining to the study characteristics, years over which the IRs were calculated, IR per 100,000 person-years, number of OPC cases, and person-years of follow-up. We extracted the overall IR and IRs stratified by sex, race, HIV status, and age, as available. For studies that reported IRs but omitted person-time and/or the number of cases used in their calculations, we emailed the authors to request information. Because some studies used the same data source for calculations (mainly multiple articles using SEER data), we included only one article from those that overlapped in time and population, prioritizing articles that reported data for the maximum person-time. Risk of bias We assessed the risk of bias in each included study using a modified version of the tool by Hoy et al. [ 21 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using R, Version 4.3.2 (R Core Team 2023, Vienna, Austria) via RStudio, Ocean Storm release (Posit Team 2023, Boston, USA). For the meta-analysis, we used the metafor package [ 22 23 Registration and reporting We registered this systematic review in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42024588671). This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). SEER data analysis 2011–2022 We obtained data from SEER-17, which includes incident cancers diagnosed in 17 registries up to 2022. We used the SEER*Stat Software to extract OPC cases and person-years by age group, sex, race, and ethnicity. We extracted annual data from 2011 to 2022. We defined OPC using ICD-O-3 codes for site and histology. We aggregated cases and person-years for the study period and calculated IRs per 100,000 person-years overall and by sex, age, and race strata using RStudio. We defined risk groups for OPC as low, medium, or high based on incidence rates of cancers that are currently screened for in the United States, and by the distribution of our data. We chose an incidence rate of 24 per 100,00 person-years as the lower limit for “high-risk” in order to not artificially separate race and age groups close to 25 cases per 100,000 person-years. Similarly, We chose an incidence rate below 10 per 100,000 person-years as “low risk”, as delineated by similar groups under this threshold in our data. Results Systematic review and meta-analysis A PRISMA flowchart of study identification for the systematic review is presented in additional file 2. Our search identified 2,210 records, 61 of which were screened in full text. The most common reasons for the exclusion of full-text articles were that IRs were only reported in figures ( n n n 4 24 33 The 11 included studies reported cases of OPC diagnosed between 1990 and 2017 using data from SEER, Medicaid, and Veterans Affairs. Five studies reported overall IRs [ 24 26 28 29 31 4 25 27 33 n 4 27 29 33 n 25 32 33 n 27 28 30 The meta-analyzed IRs of OPC are shown in Fig. 1 2  Fig. 1 Forest plots of meta-analyzed incidence rates of oropharyngeal cancer in the overall population ( A B C D  Fig. 2 Meta-analyzed incidence rates of oropharyngeal cancer by subgroup. Abbreviations: AAPI = Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders; PLWH = persons living with HIV; PY = person-years. Number of studies contributing to each estimate is indicated in squares We next explored differences in OPC incidence according to sex, race, and ethnicity (Fig. 2 Of the 11 studies, we rated seven as low risk of bias and four as moderate or high risk (Additional file 4). Moderate and high risk of bias ratings were mostly related to study populations that did not reflect our target population. This included one Medicaid [ 27 26 28 31 p SEER analysis The SEER dataset contains 56,352 incident OPC cases diagnosed between 2011 and 2022 from 17 US cancer registries. The IR for OPC in the SEER dataset was 5.5 per 100,000 PY overall, 9.1 per 100,000 PY for men, and 1.8 per 100,000 PY for women (Fig. 3 3  Fig. 3 SEER incidence rate of oropharyngeal cancer by sex and age Next, we explored racial differences in OPC incidence using SEER data. OPC incidence by race followed the same pattern as the meta-analyzed data. For each race or ethnicity, men had a higher IR than women did. For example, among White individuals, IRs were 14.2 for men and 2.7 for women, and among Black individuals, 6.1 for men and 1.3 for women. Additionally, SEER had data for American Indian/Alaska Native individuals (which the meta-analysis did not) and showed an IR of 4.5 per 100,000 PY overall (7.7 in men and 1.3 in women). We then explored differences by age and sex among each race group (Fig. 4 4 4  Fig. 4 SEER incidence rate of oropharyngeal cancer by sex and age, when further stratified by race and ethnicity. Abbreviations: AI/AN = American Indian/Alaskan Native; AAPI = Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders; PY = person-years Discussion Using nationally representative data from the US, our analysis identified high-, medium-, and low-risk populations for OPC, which can inform future OPC screening efforts. Low-risk groups included all individuals under 50 years of age and women in the general population, regardless of age, suggesting that these groups should not be considered for OPC screening. Several high-risk groups were identified, including men aged ≥ 50 years and men living with HIV. The OPC incidence among men of all ages in our study (9.1 per 100,000 PY) was higher than the IR for other HPV-associated cancers in the US, including cervical cancer in women [ 34 5 Our systematic review and meta-analysis found clear and consistent data showing that OPC incidence is almost 4-fold higher in men than in women, consistent with previous studies [ 3 35 36 37 38 4 Our comprehensive analysis is the first to delineate clear OPC risk groups, utilizing sex-, age-, and race-stratified risk. Among both men and women, OPC incidence is low until the age of 50 years, peaks between ages 60 and 79 years, and decreases slightly after age 80 years. We found that men 50–79 years of age had the highest OPC risk in all general population groups, with an incidence of 27.3 per 100,000 PY. When restricting to men 60–79 years of age, OPC incidence was higher at 32.4 per 100,000 PY; however, screening at that age would miss many cases because half of the current OPC cases are diagnosed before age 62 [ 5 39 Our analysis found that there were differences in OPC incidence according to race and ethnicity. Among men over 50, White men had the highest OPC incidence, followed by American Indian/Alaska Native and Black men (33.5, 24.9, and 20.8 per 100,000 PY, respectively), similar to several previous studies [ 32 40 41 42 43 17 44 45 46 18 47 The estimates of OPC incidence in our study were slightly higher in the meta-analysis than in the SEER analysis (IR of 13.4 vs. 9.1 per 100,000 PY for men, IR of 3.6 vs. 1.8 cases per 100,000 PY for women). This is likely explained by the non-representative ages of the populations included in some of the studies in the meta-analysis, such as older populations in the study using data from Medicaid. Conclusions about risk groups were similar in the meta-analysis and SEER analysis, although the SEER data are a better reflection of the US population risk levels for each group. In the meta-analysis, high I-squared estimates suggested heterogeneity among studies, and the pooled estimates reflected this variation. Studies have used distinct source populations that vary dramatically in size, contributing to heterogeneity across estimates. However, the similar risk groupings identified by both the meta-analysis and the SEER analysis reinforce the conclusions about which risk groups are at increased risk, although the exact estimates may vary. This study had several strengths and limitations. We used two robust and complementary epidemiologic analyses to determine the current OPC risk in the US. SEER analysis enabled well-powered stratified risk estimates in the general US population. The meta-analysis provided combined data from multiple recent US studies, allowing more precision than single studies, and included some data on PLWH not available for the SEER analysis. However, the meta-analysis was limited by the modest number of studies and high heterogeneity. Some subgroups, such as men and women with a history of anogenital cancer, may have elevated OPC risk but did not have data available to inform this analysis. Furthermore, SEER*Stat does not report HPV tumor status, so we were unable to calculate the proportion of OPC that are caused by HPV, though most OPCs in the US are HPV-related [ 42 The systematic review methods have certain limitations. First, we searched using a major platform (PubMed) and may have missed any studies not available through PubMed. Second, our initial screening involved title and subsequent abstract screening. As such, our screening may have missed studies that reported OPC incidence data but whose titles were noninformative. Furthermore, SEER*Stat does not report HIV serostatus, so we were unable to compare the conclusions from our meta-analysis for people living with HIV. To our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-analysis is one of the first to comprehensively summarize OPC incidence and report sex-, age-, and race-stratified risks. Currently, there are no approved OPC screening methods available. However, given the rising incidence of OPC, it is important to understand who should be screened if studies establish that screening tests lead to early detection with improved outcomes. Synthesizing multiple data sources, we identified that men 50–79 years old and men living with HIV are at high risk of OPC. Our analysis identified possible targets for future HPV-OPC screening strategies. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
