Introduction Numerous studies have linked sleep pathologies to cardiovascular diseases. Sleep bruxism (SB), a sleep behavior, is one of the most common sleep pathologies. In fact, SB affects 21% of the world’s population, with the highest prevalence being in North America, at 31%, and the lowest in Asia, at 19% [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Figure 1 The direct relationship between SB and the concentration of TSP-1 and TnC in human serum has not yet been studied. The aim of our study was to assess the concentration of TSP-1 and TnC in the serum of individuals diagnosed with sleep bruxism, as well as to investigate the relationship between SB and TSP-1 and TnC. We hypothesize that SB, particularly severe SB, leads to changes in the concentration of TSP-1 and TnC in human serum, thus providing a new explanation for its connection to cardiovascular diseases, and further cementing the relationship between the two. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Participants 80 participants, who were hospitalized in the Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension, and Clinical Oncology at Wroclaw Medical University, for video-PSG, were enrolled in the study. Among them, 55% were men and 45% were women. The participants were divided into two groups, the first of which included 48 participants (60%) with sleep bruxism, while 32 individuals (40%) constituted the control group. The average age was 49.76 ± 16.86. Patients who were included in the study were at least 18 years old, had signed an informed consent form for the study, and had probable sleep disorders. Exclusion criteria included the following: the presence of severe mental illness, cardiac and/or respiratory disease, active inflammation/cancer, other serious metabolic diseases, and pregnancy ( Figure 2 The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to participating in the study, all patients had signed a written informed consent form. The study received approval from the Ethical Committee of Wroclaw Medical University (no. KB-124/2024). 2.2. Polysomnography Polysomnographic examination was conducted according to the standard sleep evaluation criteria set by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM, 2013) [ 11 After the assessment, a qualified physician from the Sleep Laboratory at Wroclaw Medical University analyzed the gathered data manually in the Noxturnal system (version 2.6). Scoring for sleep disorders was conducted in line with the AASM guidelines. Standards from the AASM were used to diagnose sleep bruxism (SB). Bilateral EMG recordings were taken from the masseter muscle area, categorizing SB EMG phenotypes as being either phasic, tonic, or mixed. The Bruxism Episode Index (BEI) reflects the total number of SB episodes (phasic, tonic, and mixed) per hour. As per AASM standards, the peak EMG amplitude during a bruxism episode must be at least double that of the background EMG. If the interval between episodes was under 3 s, such intervals were considered to be a part of the same episode. A phasic event was detected if it lasted at least 2 s with three or more pulse patterns, while a tonic episode was identified by sustained pulses lasting longer than 2 s. A mixed episode was recorded when it did not fit the criteria for either a phasic or tonic event. As per the guidelines, SB was diagnosed when the BEI was at least 2, with severity being classified as follows: BEI = 2–4 indicated mild/moderate SB, and BEI > 4 denoted severe SB. 2.3. Biochemical Markers Blood was collected the morning after the polysomnographic examination, usually by puncturing the ulnar vein. It was then stored at a constant temperature until determinations were made simultaneously in all samples. The Human Tenascin-C, TN-C Elisa Kit (Bioassay Technology Laboratory, Shanghai, China) was used to determine the serum TnC concentration. The determinations were made strictly according to the test manufacturer’s instructions. The TN-c concentration was expressed as nanogram per liter (ng/L). The reference range of the assay used was 20–6000 ng/L. According to the manufacturer, the sensitivity of the ELISA test used was 10.57 ng/L. The serum TSP-1 level was calculated using the Human Thrombospondin-1, TSP-1 ELISA kit (Bioassay Technology Laboratory, Shanghai, China). These determinations were also made stringently according to the test manufacturer’s instructions. The TSP-1 concentration was expressed as nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL). The reference range of the assay used was 5–700 ng/mL. According to the manufacturer, the sensitivity of the ELISA test used was 2.39 ng/mL. Apparatus used to read the measurements: PowerWave XS Microplate Spectrophotometer BioTek, Vilnius, Lithuania, absorbance measured at 450 nm. Apparatus used during the procedure: Microplate Washer 50 TS BioTek, Microplate Thermostatic Shaker DTS-2 ELMI Vilnius, Lithuania. 2.4. Statistical Analysis “Dell Statistica 13.1” (Dell Inc., Round Rock, TX, USA) was utilized for the statistical analysis. Arithmetic means and standard deviations (SDs) of the estimated parameters were calculated for quantitative variables. The distribution of these variables was assessed using both the Lilliefors test and the W-Shapiro–Wilk test. For independent quantitative variables, Student’s t p 3. Results The study included 80 patients, 44 males and 36 females, aged 20 to 81 years. Among the group, 16 (24%) were smokers, 11 (16%) had diabetes, 30 (43%) had arterial hypertension, 6 (9%) had coronary artery disease, 5 (7%) had post-acute coronary syndrome, and 6 (4%) had a history of stroke. Details characterizing the participants are presented in Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the mean concentrations of tenascin-C and thrombospondin-1 between groups with a BEI < 2/h and BEI > 2/h, as well as with BEI > 4 and <4. Detailed data are presented in Table 4 The associations between tenascin-C, thrombospondin-1, and numerous bruxism parameters were analyzed. TnC exhibited positive correlations with BEI, Phasic bruxism, BEI non-supine, and BEI during the N2 stage of sleep. Similarly, TSP-1 showed a positive correlation with the number of Bruxism Tonic Episodes per hour. Detailed data are presented in Table 5 Figure 3 Figure 4 Then, an analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was performed. An ROC curve analysis and assessment of the predictive accuracy of the test were conducted. The optimal cutoff value for BEI in relation to tenascin-C was determined to be 10.3 ( Figure 5 In the presented analysis, it was determined that a TnC concentration exceeding the median (>601.86) is associated with a BEI > 10.3, with a sensitivity of 54.2%, specificity of 83.3%, and an accuracy of 56.4%. The studied population was then subdivided into groups with either a BEI > 10.3 or <10.3, and a statistically significant difference was found in the comparative analysis (6786.79 ± 5655.62 vs. 1585.16 ± 2526.56, p The regression analysis revealed that TnC levels are significantly associated with phasic bruxism episodes ( p p p Table 6 The analysis demonstrated significant associations between TSP-1 levels and smoking ( p p Table 7 4. Discussion 4.1. Sleep Bruxism and Its Relationship to Cardiovascular Diseases Sleep bruxism is a common sleep-related behavior that is usually considered a dental problem leading to tooth wear, temporomandibular disorders, muscle pain, and headaches. However, recent studies indicate that SB may be a possible sleep disruptor involved in sleep fragmentation, and as a result, is followed by cardiovascular complications. Sleep bruxism leads to sleep fragmentation [ 12 13 14 4 4.2. The Role of Trombospondin-1 and Tenascin-C in Atherogenesis TSP-1, which is one of the glycoproteins present in the extracellular matrix (ECM), participates in numerous processes in the body. Studies in vitro showed that TSP-1 inhibits lymphangiogenesis via activation of CD47 in Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (LEC), which suggests that LEC CD47 could, in the future, be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of atherosclerosis [ 15 16 17 18 19 Numerous studies have demonstrated that tenascin-c plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Animal studies have shown a link between TnC and many heart diseases, such as myocardial infarction, hypertensive fibrosis, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy [ 20 21 22 23 24 22 25 9 TnC and TSP-1 may also interact with lipoproteins. The migration of monocytes into the intima and the conversion into foam cells is promoted by oxidized LDL (oxLDL) or acetyl LDL (AcLDL)n and saturated free fatty acids [ 26 27 ApoE−/− mice 28 29 4.3. The Potential Pathomechanisms of Atherosclerosis in Sleep Bruxism The pathomechanisms linking SB with its cardiovascular complications remain complex and unclear. The dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system during episodes of SB appears to be one of the main culprits linking the two [ 14 14 6 4 30 31 32 33 34 31 35 In the present study, multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated the relationship between tonic bruxism and the concentration of TSP-1. We also showed that smoking is independently associated with TSP-1. To the best of our knowledge, this association, as well as the association between TnC and phasic bruxism, has been demonstrated for the very first time in this study. SB and phasic bruxism correlated with TnC in a statistically significant manner (r = 0.29, p p 4.4. The Role of Electromyographic Phenotypes of Sleep Bruxism It is worth noting that we demonstrated different pathways in the possible atherosclerotic process linked to phasic bruxism and tonic bruxism. The results indicate various mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular complications in the tonic and phasic phenotypes of SB. Previous studies have demonstrated that different pathogenic processes are responsible for tonic events, compared to phasic episodes [ 36 37 38 We have also established that smoking is independently related to TnC and TSP-1 levels, indicating the role of proteins in atherogenesis caused by smoking. 4.5. Limitations and Strengths The lack of an adaptive night may be considered a limitation in this study. Regrettably, it was not possible to conduct a night of adaptation due to the organization of the local health service. The sample size ( n 4.6. Future Research Directions The results of our study indicate new research directions. Firstly, the causation relationship between SB and cardiovascular diseases needs to be studied. Moreover, the association between TnC, TSP-1, and obstructive sleep apnea is also worth exploring. Finally, other pathways of atherogenesis in SB, including vascular endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide pathways, deserve investigation. 5. Conclusions Since Tenascin-C and Thrombospondin-1 are associated with sleep bruxism, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases may be a potential consequence of SB. However, we did not investigate the causal relationship. The above-mentioned effect is most noticeably observed in bruxism when the BEI is >10.3. Since severe bruxism occurs >4 times per hour, the study results indicate a possible relationship between TnC and TSP-1 and SB in cases of very severe bruxism. Moreover, we demonstrated different pathways in the possible atherosclerotic process linked to phasic bruxism and tonic bruxism. Therefore, further studies are required to explore this association.
