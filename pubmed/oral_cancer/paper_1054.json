Background: Mandibular angle fractures constitute a significant proportion (23%–42%) of all mandibular fractures. A persistent controversy surrounds the optimal approach for the fixation of mandibular angle fractures: whether to employ a single miniplate or two miniplates. This study aims to assess the comparative efficacy of employing a single miniplate versus two miniplates for the fixation of mandibular angle fractures. Material and Methods: Twenty male patients diagnosed with mandibular angle fractures were randomly assigned to either group I or group II. Group I received treatment with a single miniplate positioned at the superior border, while group II underwent fixation with two miniplates, one at the superior border and the other at the lateral aspect of the mandibular angle. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated for occlusal stability, infection, pain, trismus, and mediolateral flaring of the fracture segments at the lower border. Results: Group I, with a mean age of 33.90 years (range: 25–45 years), and group II, with a mean age of 28.60 years (range: 20–45 years), did not exhibit any complaints of malocclusion. In group II, infection occurred in two patients (20%), whereas no infections were observed in group I, and this difference was not statistically significant ( X 2 P X 2 P Conclusion: The utilization of two miniplates for the treatment of mandibular angle fractures does not confer any discernible advantage over the use of a single plate.

Initial preclinical investigations utilizing two plates for treating such fractures were succeeded by clinical reports presenting mixed outcomes. Nevertheless, conflicting clinical results have emerged, and extensive biomechanical tests have failed to demonstrate the advantages of employing a second miniplate. The existing literature is muddled by these discrepancies, and a unanimous consensus on definitive management protocols has yet to be reached. Thus, the primary objective of the present study is to assess the efficacy of a single miniplate versus two miniplates in the treatment of mandibular angle fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS To fulfill the research objective, we conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial involving patients seeking evaluation and management of mandibular angle fractures at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery from August 2010 to August 2012. Approval for the study design was obtained from the institutional ethics committee of the university, and all enrolled patients provided informed consent after a comprehensive explanation of the advantages and disadvantages associated with both treatment approaches. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethics committee of with reference number. DMIMS(DU)/IEC/2010-11/76 dated 30 th Inclusion criteria for study enrolment comprised patients with non-comminuted, unilateral, minimal-to-moderately displaced, unfavorable mandibular angle fractures either in isolation or in association with other mandibular fractures. In addition, patients had to be 18 years of age or older. Exclusion criteria encompassed medically compromised patients unfit for surgery and those unwilling to undergo surgical treatment. The random allocation of patients into two groups was achieved through a chit system, where each chit corresponded to a specific group. Assignment to a particular group was determined by the chit selected for each patient. Group I patients underwent treatment with a single non-compression miniplate fixed at the superior border, as recommended by Champy et al 8 Surgical technique Following the induction of general anesthesia, the surgical site was meticulously prepared with povidone iodine, and access to the fracture site was achieved through an intraoral incision. The decision to extract the third molar tooth in alignment with the fracture was made at the discretion of the operating team. In cases, where any history or clinical signs of infection with the associated tooth ecisted, were extracted. Also teeth which were fractured or teeth with apices exposed in the fracture site were also removed.[ 9 Subsequently, the fracture was carefully reduced, and maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) was accomplished using Erich Arch Bars.[ 10 11 Figure 1a b Figure 2a b Figure 1 (a) Preoperative orthopantomogram showing left mandibular body and right mandibular angle fracture.

(b) Postoperative orthopantomogram showing fixation of left mandibular parasymphysis fracture and right mandibular angle fracture using two miniplates Closure of the intraoral incision was performed using resorbable sutures, and the extraoral stab incision was closed in layers with 3-0 proglactin sutures and 4-0 prolene sutures. Postoperatively, patients underwent scheduled follow-up assessments on day 1, day 7, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. Postoperative evaluation Patients underwent comprehensive postoperative evaluations, encompassing the assessment of various parameters. These included occlusion stability, surgical site infection, mediolateral flaring of the lower border of the mandible, pain, and trismus. In addition, patients in group II were specifically evaluated for potential marginal mandibular nerve injury. Radiographical assessments were conducted using an orthopantomogram (OPG) and postero-anterior (PA) view of the mandible on day 1, at the end of the 3 rd th Occlusal stability was appraised in two ways postoperatively: subjectively by querying patients about their occlusion and objectively by evaluating the cusp-fossa relationship. Radiographic assessment of flaring at the lower border was conducted through PA mandible views, with flaring quantified using a Vernier caliper. Mediolateral flaring exceeding 2 mm was considered significant. Infection was evaluated subjectively based on patient-reported pain and/or pus discharge. The objective assessment involved scrutinizing for pus discharge, wound dehiscence, plate exposure, and radiographically identifying any radiolucency around the screws. Plate retrieval was considered in cases of infection. Pain assessment was conducted using a visual analog scale with a rating range of 0–10, where 0 denoted no pain and 10 indicated the worst pain. Patients marked along the scale to indicate the location of their maximum pain. Clinical assessment of marginal mandibular nerve injury involved checking for functional deficits related to the nerve. These comprehensive evaluations were performed at scheduled intervals during the follow-up period. Data collection and statistical analysis Collected data were meticulously entered into a detailed spreadsheet, facilitating systematic organization and analysis. Statistical methods were employed to discern meaningful insights from the dataset. The Chi-square test was utilized to compare categorical variables between the two groups. In addition, for quantitative analysis among the groups, the Student’s unpaired t RESULTS Twenty male patients with unilateral mandibular angle fractures were randomly allocated into two groups, each consisting of 10 individuals. In group I, the age range was 25–45 years, with a mean age of 33.90 years (SD: 6.90), while in group II, the age range was 20–45 years, with a mean age of 28.60 years (SD: 7.70). All study participants were males. Postoperatively, all patients exhibited stable occlusion. In group I, none of the patients experienced postoperative infection necessitating plate removal. In contrast, in group II, two patients (20%) developed postoperative infections leading to plate removal. However, this difference was not statistically significant ( χ P Table 1 Table 1 Comparison of infection rate in both groups Infection Group I Group II  X 2  P Not Infected 10 (100%) 8 (80%) 2.22 0.13 NS, P Plate Removal Required 0 (0%) 2 (20%) Total 10 (100%) 10 (100%) No instances of mediolateral lower border flaring were observed in either group.

These mean ages align with those reported by Anil Danda.[ 13 et al 14 et al 6 In the current study, non-compression miniplates were employed for the internal fixation of mandibular angle fractures. The approach aligns with the principles advocated by Champy et al 8 14 15 16 15 However, contrasting viewpoints are present in the literature. Levy et al 7 et al 17 et al 6 Achieving good occlusion and three-dimensional stability stands as the principal objective in the treatment of mandibular angle fractures. This ensures optimal chewing efficacy and mitigates the risk of long-term temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems. In the current study, all patients exhibited satisfactory occlusion postoperatively, with no statistically significant difference observed between the two groups. This aligns with the findings of Arshad Siddiqui et al 18 13 Infection at the surgical site poses a significant challenge to the success of any surgical intervention. Several factors may contribute to local site infections, including excessive periosteal stripping triggering an exaggerated inflammatory response, prolonged surgical duration, bacterial contamination from extraoral sources, hematoma formation, or issues related to the implant itself. It has been reported that the primary cause of infection associated with rigid fixation is the failure to achieve stability even after the placement of plates and screws.[ 19 20 21 18 No infections were observed in patients from group I, whereas two patients (20%) in group II exhibited infections leading to plate removal. One patient developed an infection 1 month postoperatively, while the other patient presented with an infection after 6 months. Radiographs in both cases revealed radiolucency around the screws. Subsequent re-exploration of the surgical site and implant retrieval with local curettage were performed in both instances. Although group II displayed a 20% infection rate, no significant difference in infection rates was noted between the two groups. These findings align with a study conducted by Ellis and Walker,[ 14 et al 18 et al 22 In addition, Levy et al 7 et al 23 The natural biomechanics of the mandible designate the lower border as a site of compression and the superior border as a site of tension. Flaring can manifest in both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. In compression osteosynthesis, plating is applied at the compression site, with a drawback of potential flaring at the superior border, necessitating tension banding. Miniplate osteosynthesis, in contrast, places the plate at the superior border, effectively addressing the potential flaring at the tension side and minimizing the risk of anteroposterior flaring. However, mandibular angle fractures, particularly when treated with miniplates, can exhibit a tendency to flare in the mediolateral direction during functional loading, leading to radiographically visible gaps.[ 23 24 25 26 The hypothesis posited in this study suggested that a single miniplate at the superior border might be insufficient to control the muscle forces acting at the lower border of the mandibular angle, potentially leading to mediolateral flaring. To counteract these forces, a second plate was applied at the lateral aspect of the mandibular angle region. However, the findings of our study indicate that there was no significant mediolateral flaring observed in the lower border of the mandible in either of the groups. Interestingly, a clinical investigation conducted by Schaaf H et al 27 et al 24 in vitro et al 23 in vitro 8 It is crucial to consider that the latter two studies mentioned were conducted in vitro Pain and trismus represent common symptoms arising from traumatic events and postoperative conditions affecting the muscles of mastication and their attachments. Trismus, in particular, may have intrinsic causes related to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or extrinsic factors, such as tenderness, edema, or fibrosis in the soft tissues surrounding the TMJ or fracture site, impeding normal mouth opening.[ 28 In the present study, pain was subjectively assessed using the visual analog scale. Although patients in group II reported more pain, there were no statistically significant differences observed between the two groups. However, it is noteworthy that while there was no overall statistically significant difference in trismus index between both groups, a significant difference was identified after the 1 st st The heightened occurrence of trismus in group II, where fixation was performed using two miniplates, may be attributed to a greater extent of periosteal stripping necessitated to accommodate and fix the second plate. In addition, the use of a transbuccal cannula during the fixation procedure may have resulted in injury to the masseter muscle in group II patients, contributing to the increased trismus experienced by this group. This emphasizes the importance of considering the potential impact of surgical techniques on postoperative outcomes, particularly in relation to pain and trismus, for optimizing patient care and recovery. Postoperative facial nerve damage is a complication typically associated with the treatment of angle fractures by using an extraoral approach for fixation. However, in our study, group II patients underwent a combination of intraoral and transbuccal approaches for the fixation of two miniplates, eliminating the need for an extraoral incision. The advantage offered by the transbuccal approach is that it minimizes the chances of facial nerve injury. Remarkably, no patients in group II experienced postoperative marginal mandibular nerve injury in our study. This finding contrasts with the results of a study conducted by Arshad Siddiqui et al 18 CONCLUSION The treatment of mandibular angle fractures, whether by the fixation of a single miniplate or two miniplates, yields acceptable results. Single-plate fixation is technically simple, cost-effective, and minimizes the risk of damaging the inferior alveolar nerve. In contrast, fixation using two miniplates with a transbuccal approach is technically demanding, time-consuming, expensive, and necessitates specialized instruments, a skilled operating surgeon, and an experienced assistant. It is also associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications such as infection and facial nerve damage, along with heightened postoperative morbidity in terms of pain and trismus. Fixation of unfavorable mandibular angle fractures with two miniplates does not offer additional advantages compared to single miniplate fixation. Based on the observations and results of this clinical trial, it can be concluded that single miniplate fixation is a reliable and safe procedure for treating unfavorable mandibular angle fractures. However, further clinical trials with larger sample sizes are essential to firmly establish whether single miniplate or double miniplate fixation is superior for the treatment of mandibular angle fractures. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest. REFERENCES 1.
