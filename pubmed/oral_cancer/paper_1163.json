Clinical studies in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients suggest that regular consumption of camel milk can lower fasting glucose, enhance insulin activity, and potentially decrease the need for exogenous insulin or other diabetes medications. Moreover, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may support overall metabolic health and help mitigate diabetes-related complications. As a natural product, camel milk shows promise as a complementary therapy alongside conventional diabetes treatments. Nevertheless, further large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy and elucidate the mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects. Overall, camel milk may offer meaningful advantages for glycemic control and diabetes management and warrants additional research for broader applications in other metabolic conditions. Abstract This review highlights the anti-hyperglycemic and antidiabetic properties of camel and dromedary milk (CM). Diabetes mellitus poses a significant global health challenge, and strategies that reduce reliance on insulin or other medications could substantially improve patient management. CM could represent a promising complementary approach due to its established antidiabetic effects, which are supported by its unique biological characteristics. Compared to other common milks, such as bovine milk, CM contains higher concentrations of insulin. Its distinctive physicochemical and microstructural properties help protect insulin and other bioactive proteins from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby enhancing their intestinal absorption. Furthermore, peptides generated during CM protein digestion may exert direct or indirect effects on the liver and pancreas, contributing to improved glucose metabolism. These beneficial actions are further supported by CM’s antioxidant and antilipidemic properties, which may help mitigate diabetes-related complications, including renal dysfunction and skin lesions. camel milk diabetes mellitus therapeutic properties nutritional value This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major global public health issue, with an estimated 589 million adults affected worldwide in 2024, a number expected to reach 783 million by 2045, and 853 million by 2050 among individuals aged 20–79 years [ 1 2 3 Diabetes is associated with a wide range of complications affecting multiple organ systems, including microvascular damage such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, as well as macrovascular events like cardiovascular disease and stroke. Additionally, diabetes impairs skin integrity and delays wound healing, further contributing to morbidity [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), indicating a potential role in blood pressure regulation. Antiproliferative activity against immortalized cancer cell lines, supporting its potential anticancer effects. Amelioration of metabolic symptoms associated with diabetes, including the following: Reduction in fasting blood glucose levels; Decreased insulin resistance, as measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR); Improvement of blood lipid profiles, notably through the reduction of triglycerides and cholesterol; Decreased plasma levels of LDL-C (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) and VLDL-C (Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol), along with an increase in HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) concentrations. Anticoagulant and antithrombotic properties, evidenced by the following: Reduction in coagulopathy manifestations; Improved platelet function. Antioxidant capacity, as indicated by the reduction in oxidative stress markers; Regenerative effects on pancreatic β-cells, potentially contributing to glycemic control in diabetic patients; Hepatoprotective and nephroprotective activities, including the attenuation of liver injuries and steatohepatitis, as well as protection against renal damage. These findings highlight the multifunctional bioactivity of CM, supporting its potential as a functional food with therapeutic applications across metabolic, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, and oncological health contexts. This review summarizes current knowledge on the composition and bioactive properties of CM, with particular emphasis on its potential as an adjunct to pharmacological therapy in the management of DM. For a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the therapeutic functions of CM, see Sharma et al. [ 9 2. Materials and Methods Bibliographic Search Description A comprehensive literature search was conducted across major databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, covering publications up to July 2025. The search strategy combined the following keywords: (“camel” OR “dromedary”) AND “milk” AND “diabetes”, and (“camel” OR “dromedary”) AND “milk” AND (“glycemia” OR “glycaemia”), and (“camel milk”) AND (“diabetes mellitus”). Following the initial search, articles were screened for relevance based on their titles and abstracts. Inclusion criteria were: (i) original research, review articles, or meta-analyses published in peer-reviewed journals; (ii) studies evaluating camel or dromedary milk in relation to diabetes or glucose metabolism; (iii) publications in English; and (iv) studies involving human subjects, animal models, or in vitro experiments. Publications detailing the composition of camel milk or its therapeutic effects on diabetes were also considered. After this screening, potentially relevant articles were retrieved in full text for detailed evaluation. Duplicate publications were removed, resulting in a final selection of 166 relevant articles. These studies were subsequently classified into the following thematic categories: (1) compositional and functional characteristics of camel and dromedary milk; (2) general aspects of diabetes mellitus, including its pathophysiology, classification, diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, and conventional management; (3) effects of camel/dromedary milk on Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes; and (4) proposed mechanisms of action underlying the antidiabetic properties of camel/dromedary milk.

Camel Milk Production Camel and dromedary milk (CM) has long been a staple food in arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Asia. Its consumption is now expanding due to increasing recognition of its potential health benefits, particularly in the context of metabolic and autoimmune diseases [ 10 Camels belong to the genus Camelus Camelus dromedarius Camelus bactrianus 10 11 12 Globally, camels represent only 0.4% of the global domestic herbivore population [ 13 Table 1 14 Accurately estimating average milk yield in camels is particularly challenging due to significant differences in management systems, feeding regimens, environmental conditions, and milk collection methodologies. A significant portion of available data originates from experimental stations, leaving yields under pastoral and extensive systems largely undocumented [ 15 11 15 16 11 17 18 n 19 Table 2 To standardize milk yield comparisons, Zhang et al. [ 20 21 10 biology-14-01162-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Camel milk yield and lactation duration across different regions. Region/Country Milk Yield Lactation Duration No. of Animals Ref.

Camel Milk’s Gross Composition Milk is a fundamental component of human nutrition and is widely consumed worldwide. While bovine milk remains the most extensively consumed due to its high availability and economic significance, global interest in alternative milk sources has increased considerably in recent years [ 22 22 Until a few decades ago, the scientific literature on CM was relatively limited, with early investigations focusing primarily on its chemical composition [ 23 24 11 25 26 27 28 CM is also characterized by distinctive protein features, including a low content of κ-casein and the absence of β-lactoglobulin in its whey fraction, which may contribute to its reduced allergenicity [ 29 30 31 In terms of gross composition, Gnan and Sheriha [ 32 A meta-analysis by Konuspayeva et al. [ 33 Table 3 Recently, Benmeziane-Derradji [ 14 14 4.1. Protein The protein content of CM shows considerable variability, ranging from 2.15% to 4.61%, with an overall mean of approximately 3.03%, making it an important source of high-quality protein for populations in arid and semi-arid regions [ 14 34 35 36 37 Caseins represent the dominant protein fraction in CM, accounting for 52% to 87% of total proteins [ 38 39 40 41 42 A key distinctive feature of CM is the absence of β-lactoglobulin, a major whey protein that constitutes about 50% of the whey fraction in bovine milk [ 43 44 45 25 4.2. Fat The fat content of CM, as in other ruminants, is influenced by multiple factors including breed, physiological status, season, diet, reproductive condition, and lactation stage [ 46 14 47 46 48 The fatty acid (FA) profile of CM is characterized predominantly by saturated fatty acids, mainly myristic and palmitic acids, along with odd-numbered, unsaturated long-chain and short-chain FAs. In particular, saturated FAs constitute 46.41% to 65.08% of total fat, monounsaturated FAs 28.18% to 49.31%, and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) 1.97% to 4.26% [ 14 49 50 46 Particular nutritional interest in CM also stems from its relatively high PUFA content, which is essential for human health. Ayadi et al. [ 51 52 52 4.3. Lactose Lactose, the main carbohydrate in ruminant milk, exhibits considerable variability, ranging from 2.93% to 5.12%, with an average value of approximately 4.26% [ 14 53 54 55 56 As with other milk components, lactose content is influenced by multiple factors, including seasonal variations and the mobility status of the animals, reflecting environmental and physiological adaptations [ 55 57 4.4. Vitamins CM contains measurable amounts of vitamins A, D, and E; however, one of its most distinctive nutritional characteristics is its exceptionally high vitamin C content [ 58 58 59 60 4.5. Minerals As in other mammalian species, CM is rich in minerals, particularly calcium and phosphorus, with total mineral content ranging from 0.60% to 1.30% and a mean value of 0.80% [ 14 61 62 33 Compared to sheep and goat milk, CM generally has lower calcium content but higher levels of sodium, potassium, and copper [ 63 64 65 Table 4 65 4.6. CM Composition Variation During Lactation As in other mammalian species, CM undergoes substantial compositional changes throughout lactation. Zhang et al. [ 20 20 Fatty acid composition also showed notable changes over lactation. For instance, Bactrian camel colostrum was characterized by a predominance of even-numbered saturated fatty acids and higher polyunsaturated fatty acid content compared to mature milk [ 20 20 Across various studies, the concentrations of major minerals and electrolytes in dromedary milk, such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium, ranged from 23 to 214 mg/100 g [ 23 48 58 64 20 Dromedary colostrum also exhibited dynamic changes during early lactation. Konuspayeva et al. [ 66 33 66 Table 5 Camel Milk: A Putative Functional Food in Supporting Diabetes Mellitus? Milk represents a highly complex biological system, comprising diverse molecules whose functional effects depend not only on their individual concentrations but also on their interactions. CM, due to its distinctive chemical and biochemical composition, has been proposed as a dietary adjuvant in the management of all forms of diabetes mellitus. Its composition differs substantially from that of cow and sheep milk, which may contribute to the lower prevalence of diabetes observed in populations where CM is regularly consumed, either as fresh milk, fermented products, or other derivatives [ 67 In particular, CM exhibits unique physicochemical and bioactive characteristics. It does not coagulate readily under acidic conditions, a trait potentially linked to its low degree of casein phosphorylation [ 54 67 68 69 5. Diabetes Mellitus in Humans: Classification and Prevalence Diabetes mellitus is a group of disorders characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from impaired insulin secretion, insulin action, or a combination of both [ 3 3 Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Specific types of diabetes due to other causes Gestational diabetes mellitus In humans, normal reference values for blood glucose range between 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) (World Health Organization, WHO website [ 70 3 Chronic hyperglycemia, the hallmark of diabetes, is associated with a broad spectrum of complications involving the kidneys, cardiovascular system, eyes, nervous system, and skin. Effective glycemic control, achieved through the administration of insulin, hypoglycemic agents, appropriate dietary management, and physical activity, is essential to reduce the risk of these long-term complications and improve patient outcomes [ 71 As of 2024, an estimated 589 million adults aged 20–79 years worldwide (approximately 11.1% of the global population in that age group) are living with DM [ 1 72 1 6. Effects of Camel Milk on Diabetes Mellitus One of the most compelling aspects of CM research lies in the diverse bioactive molecules and their derivatives that may contribute to its health-promoting effects in both animals and humans [ 73 6.1. Effects on Hyperglycemia Several studies have shown that consumption of CM by patients with type 1 diabetes can lead to a significant reduction in blood glucose levels, along with a decrease in exogenous insulin requirements by up to 30% [ 74 75 76 77 78 Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antidiabetic effects of CM, including: (1) the encapsulation of insulin-like proteins in lipid vesicles, which may enhance their stability and targeted delivery [ 79 48 The hypoglycemic effects of CM and its bioactive components have been demonstrated in experimental animal models of diabetes. Agrawal et al. [ 76 80 81 82 Non-rodent models provided similar evidence: Sboui et al. [ 83 In a recent study, Arain et al. [ 84 Supporting the potential role of CM as a functional dietary adjunct in diabetes management, numerous clinical human studies have examined its short- and long-term effects in individuals with both T1DM and T2DM. These studies consistently reported improved glycemic control and reduced reliance on exogenous insulin, highlighting CM as a promising complementary dietary intervention in diabetes management. In patients with T1DM, Agrawal et al. [ 27 77 Long-term benefits were also reported by Mohamad et al. [ 85 In T2DM patients, CM has shown similar beneficial effects. A randomized controlled trial in Iran by Fallah et al. [ 86 Recently, Sboui et al. [ 87 Despite these encouraging findings, the effects of CM on glucose homeostasis are multifaceted and, at times, inconsistent. A comprehensive meta-analysis by AlKurd et al. [ 88 88 Table 6 Finally, in relation to the prevalence of DM, Agrawal et al. [ 74 p p p Table 7 6.2. Effects on Hyperlipidemia Dyslipidemia is a frequent comorbidity in all forms of diabetes mellitus, characterized by abnormal plasma lipid profiles that increase the risk of cardiovascular and other vascular complications. Emerging evidence from both experimental animal models and clinical studies suggests that camel milk (CM) may positively influence lipid metabolism, thereby supporting cardiometabolic health in diabetic individuals. These benefits are partly attributed to its distinctive fatty acid profile: CM contains higher levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic acids), and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) compared to bovine milk, while being lower in cholesterol and saturated fats. Such a composition may help normalize lipid profiles, lower triglycerides, and improve the LDL/HDL ratio, ultimately reducing cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, its medium-chain fatty acids and elevated L-carnitine content may promote fatty acid oxidation and enhance energy metabolism, offering additional support for glycemic control and overall metabolic health [ 50 In an experimental study on alloxan-induced diabetic dogs, Sboui et al. [ 83 80 81 In human studies, Agrawal et al. [ 89 27 90 83 A meta-analysis regarding the lipid profile in diabetic patients has been performed by Khalid et al. [ 91 Table 8 6.3. Effects on Diabetes Complications Chronic hyperglycemia in DM leads to dysfunction across multiple organ systems due to the central role of glucose in overall metabolism. Beyond glycemic control, CM has demonstrated potential in mitigating several DM-associated complications. Several studies have highlighted the protective effects of CM and its whey components on liver function. For example, Hamad et al. [ 92 81 CM also exhibits notable antithrombotic effects. Korish et al. [ 7 CM has also shown promising effects in mitigating renal complications. In patients with T1DM, CM treatment over a six-month period significantly reduced microalbuminuria, suggesting a nephroprotective role [ 89 85 Among the most prevalent and challenging complications of both T1DM and T2DM is impaired wound healing. Several studies suggest that CM, particularly its whey proteins and hydrolysates, can promote wound repair through modulation of immune responses and enhancement of tissue regeneration. Badr et al. [ 82 Many of CM’s benefits may stem from its ability to counteract oxidative stress, a major factor in vascular and neurological diabetic complications [ 93 21 94 95 96 97 98 99 7. CM Anti-Diabetic Activity: Proposed Mechanisms of Action 7.1. Anti-Hyperglycemic Mechanisms The hypoglycemic effects of CM are among its most promising therapeutic properties, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain only partially understood. Evidence suggests that CM influences glucose homeostasis through multiple biological pathways, including interactions with cell surface receptors, modulation of gene expression, and the activity of bioactive peptides and proteins. Specifically, CM appears to regulate insulin synthesis and secretion while facilitating glucose transport and metabolism in target tissues. The proposed mechanisms underlying the anti-hyperglycemic effects of CM can be broadly grouped into three main pathways [ 100 (1) Direct modulation of insulin receptors and glucose transport across cell membranes; (2) Stimulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells through both direct and indirect mechanisms; (3) Support of pancreatic β-cell survival and function, thereby enhancing overall pancreatic activity. Although the anti-diabetic potential of CM is increasingly recognized, confirmation through comprehensive in vivo studies remains necessary. Current evidence indicates that its effects are primarily mediated through coordinated actions on both the pancreas and the liver, supporting glucose regulation and overall metabolic balance. In particular, the liver is a key insulin-sensitive organ that expresses not only insulin receptors but also glucagon receptors (GCGR) [ 100 Figure 1 100 101 101 The hypothesis of a direct interaction between CM and insulin receptors is supported by the high concentration of insulin present in CM (approximately 52 U/L), which is about four times greater than that found in cow’s milk [ 102 48 79 103 104 48 Along with its direct effects, CM may exert indirect actions on insulin synthesis and secretion by pancreatic β-cells, potentially mediated by bioactive peptides. These peptides are thought to influence various biochemical pathways involved in the regulation of insulin production and exocytosis [ 100 105 106 The indirect effects of CM on pancreatic function may involve multiple mechanisms, including the stimulation of GLUT4 transporter activity, the suppression of glucagon secretion by pancreatic α-cells, and the inhibition of enzymes such as dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), a key regulator of incretin degradation ( Figure 2 100 100 107 Finally, CM molecular complexes may exert beneficial effects on the immune system and redox balance across various cell types, including pancreatic β-cells. These properties can enhance β-cell function by improving their overall viability, thereby promoting insulin synthesis and secretion. In type 1 diabetic rat models, administration of CM whey proteins was associated with a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), accompanied by an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) [ 108 109 110 108 110 Figure 2 7.2. Anti-Lipidemic Mechanisms The anti-lipidemic effects of CM are closely linked to its glucose-lowering properties. Moneim et al. [ 111 112 112 7.3. Antioxidant Mechanisms of CM T1DM is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the selective destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells without apparent pathological alterations of other Langerhans cells. T1DM varies in age, severity of autoimmune response, and therapy efficacy, with both humoral and cellular immunity involved in its pathogenesis. The predominant theory is that β-cell pancreatic islets in patients with T1DM suffer from inflammation, leading to a condition called insulitis. Regulatory T cells are also defective in this autoimmune disease setting. Animal models show that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells participate in the development of T1DM, targeting several β-cell auto-antigens and related peptide epitopes. T-cell subtypes can induce destructive peri-islet inflammatory infiltrate and overt diabetes. Macrophages seem to be critical mediators of islet inflammation, due to their ability to secrete cytokines and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS); the biology of the beta cell can therefore directly influence the response to an inflammatory environment, leading to multiple pathways contributing to pancreatic beta cell death. In T2DM, hyperglycemia leads to an increase in ROS production. This heightened oxidative stress can impair the function of pancreatic β-cells; this situation contributes to insulin resistance, making it harder for cells to use insulin to absorb glucose from the blood. Moreover, oxidative stress damages various cellular components, including lipids, proteins, and DNA. This damage is a major contributor to the long-term complications of diabetes. For a complete review of these concepts refer to the dedicated review of Tsalamandris et al. [ 113 The antioxidant properties of CM and whey-derived peptide fractions contribute significantly to enhanced wound healing in diabetic rats and mice [ 114 115 82 115 116 117 117 Additionally, insulin naturally present in CM undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver, where it inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis and consequently enhances the hypoglycemic action of pancreatic β-cells [ 118 Some of these antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are also observed in fermented CM products, including shubat (China and Kazakhstan), khoormang (Mongolia), iben (Saudi Arabia), garris (Sudan), suusac (Kenya), and ititu (Ethiopia) [ 5 7.4. CM Wound Healing Mechanisms The wound healing properties of CM are attributed to its diverse bioactive components, including immunoglobulins, α-lactalbumin, peptidoglycans, and lactoferrin, which collectively provide antioxidant and regenerative support [ 119 82 114 116 100 7.5. Hepatoprotective Mechanisms of CM CM has been shown to protect against various liver injuries, including both alcoholic and non-alcoholic hepatitis, largely due to the activity of its immunoglobulins [ 120 101 7.6. CM Kidney Protective Mechanisms In diabetes, metabolic dysregulation often elevates endotoxin levels in the kidney, which activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) and trigger pro-inflammatory cascades. Among these, TLR-4 plays a key role by stimulating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and promoting the release of potent cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [ 121 122 123 124 7.7. The Role of Lactoferrin from CM Lactoferrin is one of the most bioactive proteins in camel milk and a key contributor to its anti-diabetic effects. In vitro studies using immortalized cell lines such as HEK293 and HepG2 have shown that lactoferrin modulates insulin receptor activity and regulates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways [ 125 126 127 Evidence also suggests that lactoferrin, along with intact whey proteins and their hydrolysates, enhances insulin receptor activity in vitro, primarily through positive allosteric interactions [ 126 127 128 7.8. The Role of Protein-Derived Peptides The beneficial effects of milk proteins on hyperglycemia in both T1DM and T2DM are significantly enhanced by bioactive peptides generated during gastric and intestinal digestion [ 129 130 131 132 133 134 Antidiabetic peptides from CM have been obtained using various hydrolytic methods, including bacterial fermentation and simulated gastrointestinal digestion [ 134 Streptococcus thermophilus Lactobacillus bulgaricus Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus casei Bifidobacterium bifidum Interestingly, the bioactivity of processed CM increases with storage time; its enzyme-inhibitory capacity becomes more pronounced between 3 and 6 h post-processing. In contrast, cow milk does not exhibit similar improvement under identical conditions. The first two peptides isolated from CM with confirmed human pancreatic α-amylase inhibitory activity were obtained through fermentation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 135 136 Numerous studies have reported the identification of bioactive, protein-inhibitory peptides generated through in vitro proteolysis of CM proteins, simulating gastrointestinal digestion [ 134 101 129 137 137 The inhibitory activity on DPP-IV appears enhanced following alcalase hydrolysis of CM proteins. Two peptides, Asp-Asn-Leu-Met-Pro-Gln-Phe-Met and Trp-Asn-Trp-Gly-Trp-Leu-Leu-Trp-Gln, bind to eight and seven active sites of DPP-IV, respectively, while three others—Cys-Phe-Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu-Leu-Lys, Met-Met-His-Asp-Phe-Leu-Thr-Cys-Leu-Met, and Ser-Gln-Asp-Trp-Phe-Ser-Tyr—interact with six active residues [ 137 138 Mudgil et al. [ 136 132 Some of the beneficial effects of CM on glycemic control may be mediated by insulin-like small molecules found broadly in animals and plants. Additionally, certain milk fatty acids, including trans fatty acids, can influence glycemic regulation either positively or negatively. For example, trans-palmitoleate (trans-16:1n-7 palmitoleate) has been associated with a reduced incidence of diabetes, whereas its cis cis 138 CM proteins, and particularly their derived peptides, also exhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. ACE is an extrinsic membrane metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system by converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that promotes hypertension [ 139 140 Anwar et al. [ 141 7.9. Camel Milk Exosomes: A Novel Nanocomponent in Glycemic Control and Diabetes Management Exosomes are small extracellular nanovesicles, typically 40–100 nm in diameter, released by various cell types, including those that produce milk. These vesicles carry diverse bioactive molecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, and have been detected in multiple body fluids, including blood, urine, and milk. Milk-derived exosomes play a critical role in intercellular communication by transferring key molecules like DNA, mRNA, microRNAs, proteins, and peptides between cells, thereby influencing physiological processes [ 142 Exosomes in milk have also been shown to have potential therapeutic applications, since their multiple properties (anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-allergic, and immunomodulatory) [ 143 144 145 The beneficial effects of exosomes are often attributed to their rich phospholipid composition. In CM, for example, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine concentrations range from approximately 10–15 mg/mL and 20–25 mg/mL, respectively, remaining relatively stable throughout lactation [ 145 146 Exosomes originate from multivesicular bodies within cells and are released through membrane fusion, distinguishing them from larger microvesicles, which measure approximately 1 µm in diameter [ 147 145 148 149 CM exosomes display notable anti-inflammatory activity by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, TGF-β1, IL-1β, and NF-κB in tumor cells [ 150 151 152 153 154 The immunomodulatory effects of CM exosomes involve complex interactions among natural killer (NK) cells, CD4+ helper T cells, and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells [ 155 156 157 154 158 Furthermore, camel milk contains heavy chain-only antibodies (nanobodies) capable of crossing cell membranes and triggering immune responses [ 144 156 128 7.10. Non-Parenteral Administration of Insulin: Looking Forward The non-parenteral administration of insulin in human patients remains a significant challenge due to the risk of severe hypoglycemia. Among alternative routes, oral administration is particularly appealing; however, insulin, being a protein, is readily degraded in the acidic and enzymatic environment of the stomach, limiting its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. To enhance insulin stability in the gastrointestinal tract and improve its bioavailability, several oral nanodelivery systems have been developed. These nanoformulations can be customized to individual patient needs, offer prolonged action, and allow controlled release of the therapeutic molecule [ 159 160 79 161 162 Additionally, insulin from CM has a smaller molecular size compared to other insulins, which may facilitate its more efficient integration into systemic circulation [ 163 104 7.11. Additional Considerations: Potential Limitations, Safety Risks, and Regulatory Status In recognition of the nutritional, economic, and cultural significance of camelids, the United Nations designated 2024 as the “International Year of Camelids”. CM, traditionally consumed in arid and semi-arid regions, is increasingly marketed globally as a premium commodity due to its distinctive nutritional composition, particularly the absence of β-lactoglobulin, a major bovine milk allergen, rendering it closer to human milk and potentially suitable for some individuals with cow’s milk allergy [ 164 165 Its unique protein, lipid, and vitamin profile underscores its high market value but also presents technological challenges. Low κ-casein content, large casein micelles, and reduced thermal stability lead to poor coagulation, prolonged fermentation, and instability during ultra-high temperature (UHT) processing; pasteurization above 80 °C can cause separation and quality deterioration [ 6 166 From a food safety perspective, unpasteurized CM shares the microbiological hazards of other raw animal milks, including Brucella Escherichia coli Salmonella Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus 167 Economic adulteration, especially dilution with bovine milk, further threatens consumer safety, market integrity, and fair trade [ 6 8. Conclusions CM may have the potential as a supporting adjunct in the management of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, thanks to its unique composition and bioactive properties. Although its production and availability remain limited, further experimental research is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the hypoglycemic effects of CM and to support its development as a natural therapeutic agent. Additionally, the bioactive compounds derived from CM, given their antioxidant potential and positive effects on key metabolic organs such as the liver, pancreas, and kidneys, may have broader therapeutic applications in various chronic and metabolic diseases. Moreover, regular consumption of CM may also support metabolic homeostasis in healthy individuals, contributing to the promotion of overall health and disease prevention. It is desirable to extend clinical trials to larger groups of patients and with more complex experimental designs, with the aim of reinforcing long-established hypotheses about the positive aspects of using CM in different types of diabetes mellitus. CM may thus have great scope for expansion, due to its peculiar composition and a growing world-wide demand, as pointed out by Sharma et al.
