Introduction Bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) are part of the chemosensory G-protein coupled receptor (GPCRs) family. While they are primarily known for detecting bitter compounds in the oral cavity, their function extends beyond taste perception. Since their extraoral discovery in transmembrane regions of gastric cells, such as in parietal cells of the stomach [ 1 1 1 2 3 4 2+ 2+ 2+ 5 6 7 Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal with no biological function in humans. Its introduction into the human body, primarily via contaminated water, food, or air pollution from industrial activities or tobacco smoke, is linked to severe health consequences, including renal dysfunction [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 + + 20 21 22 7 2+ 23 2+ 24 2+ 25 26 27 28 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 34 35 32 36 37 38 In a recent study using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach [ 7 2. Results The primary hypothesis of this work focused on TAS2Rs regulating PSA as a response to Cd exposure as a key mechanism of gastric acid secretion. Secondarily, it was hypothesized that TAS2Rs are involved in the cellular uptake of Cd. 2.1. Cadmium-Induced Reduction of PSA in HGT-1 Cells Is Mediated by TAS2Rs To assess the functional involvement of TAS2Rs in Cd-evoked modulation of mechanisms regulating gastric acid secretion, the PSA was measured using the fluorescent dye SNARF-1AM. The response of cells treated with 62.5, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 µM CdCl 2 Figure 1 Figure 1 2 To identify decisive TAS2Rs involved in PSA, mRNA expression levels of human TAS2Rs 2 TAS2R1 As shown in Figure 2 2 TAS2R p TAS2R14 39 50 2 TAS2R5 TAS2R8 TAS2R10 TAS2R14 Table S1 Pearson correlation analyses revealed significant associations between the ddCt values of several receptor genes and PSA levels: TAS2R8 p 10 p 14 p 16 p TAS2R8 TAS2R10 Figure 2 2 Figure 3 To verify the functional involvement of TAS2R8 and TAS2R10 in the PSA of HGT-1 cells, a transient knockdown (KD) approach using siRNA was employed. KD efficiency was validated by RT-qPCR, showing a mean reduction in gene expression of 69% for TAS2R8 TAS2R10 PSA data following receptor KD were analyzed via one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Notably, no significant difference was observed between untreated control cells and mock-transfected cells. However, cells with TAS2R8 TAS2R10 p Figure 4 TAS2R8 Figure 4 TAS2R10 Figure 4 Table S2 t These findings support a functional role for TAS2R8 and TAS2R10 in Cd-induced proton secretion mechanisms. 2.2. Functional Role of TAS2R8 and TAS2R10 in Cellular Cadmium Uptake Given that TAS2Rs have been associated with modulating the uptake of small molecules [ 39 7 2 2+ 2 Figure 5 2+ Next, to determine whether TAS2Rs influence Cd uptake directly, intracellular Cd 2+ TAS2R8 TAS2R10 TAS2R8 2+ t TAS2R10 2 2+ Figure 6 Together, these results support a differential role of TAS2R8 and TAS2R10 in regulating Cd uptake in parietal cells, either by facilitating or limiting intracellular accumulation depending on the receptor subtype. 2.3. Genomic Targets of Cellular Cadmium Transport To gain a broader qualitative understanding of the cellular Cd transport in gastric parietal cells, a cDNA microarray analysis was performed. The aim of this screening was to identify and confirm the relevance of genes known for Cd transport. Therefore, a concentration of 500 µM CdCl 2 TAS2Rs Figure 7 p To focus the analysis on genetic targets associated with cadmium ion transport in HGT-1 cells, a gene ontology (GO) [ 40 41 SLC11A1 SLC11A2 SLC39A14 SLC39A2 SLC39A8 SLC11A2 SLC39A14 Figure 7 2 SLC39A2 SLC39A14 SLC30A1 SLC11A2 However, these differences did not reach statistical significance, albeit with large effect sizes (>0.8). Conversely, SLC39A2 SLC11A1 SLC11A1 SLC39A14 SLC11A2 SLC39A8 SLC39A2 p SLC11A1 p Table S3 SLC39A2 Given the limited number of annotated gene targets specifically involved in cadmium transport and the established competition of Cd with other divalent metal transporters, we expanded our gene ontology analysis to include the broader term “transition metal ion transport” (GO:0000041). This category encompasses the transport of transition metals with incomplete d-subshells, including vanadium, manganese, iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, and silver. Using this comprehensive approach, we identified a total of 211 annotated genes, with the majority linked to iron and zinc transport. Among the analyzed transcripts, 12 exhibited significant changes ( p 2 Table S4 SLC22A17 SLC39A2 SLC11A1 SLC39A10 NECTIN 1 2 HFE FTL TF CYBRD1 SLC39A10 SLC39A4 Since CdCl 2 Figure 8 This analysis highlights, at the gene level, the apparent uniqueness of iron and zinc ion transport: 88 and 73 genes are uniquely annotated for iron and zinc transport, respectively, whereas each metal shares only four genes with other sets. In contrast, Cd does not possess any uniquely annotated transporter genes; its annotation is entirely based on genes also involved in the transport of other transition metal ions. The overlap between cadmium and iron ( SLC11A1 SLC11A2 SLC39A2 SLC30A1 SLC39A14 SLC39A8 To investigate whether the cellular Cd uptake might be modulated by bitter taste receptor activity, a functional protein interaction network analysis was conducted using the Reactome pathway database [ 42 43 TAS2R8 TAS2R10 SLC11A1 SLC11A2 SLC30A1 SLC39A14 SLC39A2 SLC39A8 43 Figure 9 ESR1 TAS2R8 TAS2R10 GNB3 GNAT3 ESR1 SLC30A1 SLC30A2 SLC30A4 SLC39A2 ESR1 NFKB1 SOD1 SLC11A1 NFKB1 SLC39A4 SLC39A14 SLC4A1 SLC4A2 ESR1 SLC39A8 GATA1 Integrating the comparative gene ontology analysis with the constructed network reveals that the two genes found at the intersection of zinc and cadmium transport are positioned within the NFKB1 SOD1 NFKB1 TAS2R8 SLC39A2 TAS2R10 SLC4A1 SLC4A2 SLC39A14 3. Discussion Building on previous research, the current study hypothesized a functional role of TAS2Rs in PSA and Cd uptake mechanisms in human gastric parietal cells. As a result, we identified that Cd exposure led to (i) a dose-dependent decrease in PSA and (ii) differentially regulated cellular Cd uptake. Our results highlight the dose-dependent decrease in PSA, consistent with previous findings of Cd’s inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion [ 14 16 1 2 Figure 2 1 7 TAS2Rs TAS2R1 7 9 38 41 60 TAS2R14 TAS2R50 2 TAS2R8 TAS2R10 Figure 3 TAS2R8 TAS2R10 2 Figure 4 Figure 1 TAS2R8 TAS2R10 2 7 Only a few agonists have been identified for TAS2R8, including chloramphenicol and denatonium benzoate. TAS2R10, on the other hand, appears more promiscuous [ 44 45 46 47 39 2+ 7 2+ 2 Figure 5 TAS2R8 2+ 2 Figure 6 TAS2R10 2+ 2 The study utilized a comprehensive cDNA microarray screening to characterize the transcriptomic landscape following CdCl 2 2 Figure 7 SLC39A2 SLC11A1 SLC39A14 SLC30A1 SLC11A2 SLC39A8 SLC39A2 SLC11A1 SLC39A2 Recognizing (a) the sparse annotation of cadmium transport genes in the human genome, and (b) the competitive uptake of Cd through divalent metal transporters, the GO framework was broadened to “transition metal ion transport,” revealing a total of 211 target genes, predominantly assigned to iron and zinc transport. Notably, eleven solute carrier (SLC) genes, including both presumed and established transition metal transporters (such as SLC22A17 SLC39A2 SLC39A10 SLC11A1 NECTIN 1 2 HFE FTL TF CYBRD1 SLC39A10 SLC39A4 TRPM3 Future studies using integrated systemic approaches are needed to verify the functional role of carrier proteins and their transcript variants in cellular Cd uptake in response to Cd exposure w/o the presence of competing divalent metal ions. The importance of recognizing the interactions between Cd and other transition metal ions is demonstrated by the subsequent comparative gene ontology and Venn diagram analyses ( Figure 8 Instead, cadmium’s assigned transporter repertoire is nested within the much larger iron and zinc transporter sets, specifically through shared SLC11 and SLC39 proteins. Only four genes overlapped between each pairwise combination, and two genes, SLC39A14 SLC39A8 48 To elucidate the regulatory and functional connectivity of Cd transport and its potential modulation by bitter taste receptors, a protein interaction network was engineered using Reactome, incorporating both taste receptor ( TAS2R8 TAS2R10 Figure 9 ESR1 NFKB1 SOD1 SLC39A2 49 SLC30A1 50 NFKB1 SOD1 Whereas TAS2R8 SLC39A2 2 2+ TAS2R8 SLC39A2 TAS2R10 SLC39A14 2 ESR1 NFKB1 SOD1 Together, these results substantiate the premise that Cd transport in gastric parietal cells does not occur via dedicated, unique molecular machinery. Instead it co-opts the broad specificity and regulatory architecture already in place for essential metal ions such as iron and zinc [ 51 Nevertheless, certain limitations of the present study should be considered: The reliance on transcriptomic readouts may not fully capture regulatory effects occurring at the post-transcriptional or transporter activity levels. The narrow annotation of Cd transporter activity and the low number of unique transporter candidates impede both the discovery and functional dissection of potential Cd-specialized mechanisms. It is also possible that key regulatory responses are cell type-, time-, or concentration-dependent and thus not fully captured at a single concentration or time point. Future research should address these gaps by extending functional validations such as transporter knockdown or overexpression studies and transporter-specific flux assays, exploring temporal dynamics of transcriptional and translational regulation upon Cd exposure, and leveraging single-cell approaches for greater resolution. Further, systematic improvements to gene ontology databases are warranted to capture noncanonical roles of known transporters in Cd handling. Mechanistic experiments examining the causality between bitter taste receptor signaling and transporter gene regulation, as well as the involvement of central network hubs such as ESR1 and NFKB1, will help clarify the signal integration processes governing cellular Cd responses. Such insights are crucial not only for basic metal biology but also for devising targeted strategies to mitigate Cd toxicity in exposed tissues. In summary, our study uncovers a novel functional link between PSA and cellular Cd uptake in human gastric cells exposed to CdCl 2 TAS2R8 TAS2R10 4. Materials and Methods 4.1.

Conclusions This study highlights the functional role of TAS2Rs in regulating proton secretion and Cd uptake in gastric parietal cells. Cd was shown to reduce gastric acid secretion via TAS2R-mediated pathways, while genome-wide analysis revealed additional targets related to metal ion transport. The differential effects of TAS2R8 and TAS2R10 on Cd uptake emphasize the complex interplay between Cd, TAS2Rs, and cellular metal ion transport. This work opens new perspectives for investigating TAS2R-specific interactions and the need to elucidate the specific transport pathways, particularly in the context of essential metal ion homeostasis and human health.
