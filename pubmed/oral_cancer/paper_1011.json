Introduction The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a vast and intricate network of membranes, serves as a crucial intracellular organelle responsible for a wide array of fundamental cellular processes. It is the main site for the synthesis of lipids, including phospholipids and steroids, and plays a central role in the biosynthesis of cholesterol [ 1 2 Critically, the ER’s primary function is to serve as the cellular protein factory, where newly synthesized proteins are folded, modified, and assembled into their correct three-dimensional structures [ 3 4 1.1. The Onset of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress The cell’s ability to function properly hinges on the ER’s capacity to handle the protein and lipid load it is tasked with. However, this capacity can be easily overwhelmed by various physiological and pathological conditions, including oxidative stress, viral infections, nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, or genetic mutations that lead to defective protein folding [ 5 6 6 To cope with ER stress, cells have evolved a sophisticated and highly conserved adaptive signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) [ 7 1 Initially, the UPR functions to restore homeostasis by attenuating global protein synthesis (via PERK), upregulating the expression of chaperones and protein degradation machinery (via IRE1 and ATF6), and enhancing the ER’s folding capacity. This protective phase is a crucial survival mechanism. However, if ER stress is persistent or too severe for these adaptive measures to succeed, the UPR pivots to a pro-apoptotic program, primarily through the activation of the transcription factor CHOP, ultimately leading to programmed cell death to eliminate the damaged cell and prevent systemic harm. The dysregulation of the UPR and chronic ER stress are now firmly established as pivotal drivers in the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases [ 5 In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, ER stress contributes to the aggregation of misfolded proteins (e.g., amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein), which is a hallmark of these conditions [ 8 9 In metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes and obesity, ER stress in key metabolic organs such as the liver and pancreas impairs insulin signaling, leading to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction [ 10 Moreover, cancer cells often exploit the UPR to survive the challenging conditions of the tumor microenvironment, including hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, with ER stress promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Its involvement also extends to inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular pathologies, and viral infections, underscoring the universal importance of ER function in maintaining cellular health [ 11 12 1.2. Rationale for Investigating Natural Products as Therapeutic Modulators Given the central role of ER stress in disease, the UPR has emerged as a compelling therapeutic target [ 13 12 14 Despite the broad recognition of the UPR’s therapeutic potential and the rich diversity of natural products, the specific mechanisms by which many of these compounds modulate the UPR remain underexplored. While some studies have focused on single compounds or isolated pathways, there is a notable gap in the literature regarding a systematic, multi-faceted analysis of natural product derivatives and their integrated effects on the full spectrum of UPR signaling branches (PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6). This study addresses this critical gap by providing a comprehensive investigation into the molecular mechanisms through which natural compounds modulate the UPR. 2. The Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic and responsive organelle, whose functional integrity is paramount for cell survival. Its vast network of membranes maintains a distinct internal environment, known as the ER lumen, which is a finely tuned system for protein folding and modification. The stability of this environment, or ER homeostasis, is continuously monitored. However, this delicate balance can be readily disrupted by a variety of internal and external factors, leading to a state of ER stress [ 15 2.1. ER Homeostasis and Stress Inducers ER stress can be triggered by any condition that leads to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. These inducers are diverse and impact different aspects of ER function. Hypoxia and nutrient deprivation are common stressors, as they deplete the cell’s ATP reserves, which are essential to power the chaperones and enzymes that assist in protein folding [ 16 11 The ER is also the cell’s largest intracellular calcium store, and a disruption in its calcium balance, often due to the malfunction of SERCA pumps or ion channels, can severely impair the activity of calcium-dependent chaperones [ 17 18 19 2.2. Key UPR Signaling Pathways To counteract ER stress and restore homeostasis, cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), a sophisticated signaling network regulated by three key ER-resident transmembrane sensors: PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6 (see also Figure 1 2.2.1. The PERK Pathway The PERK (PKR-like ER Kinase) pathway is a rapid-acting response to ER stress. Under normal conditions, the ER chaperone BiP (also known as GRP78) binds to and keeps PERK in an inactive state [ 5 5 2.2.2. The IRE1α Pathway The IRE1α (inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha) pathway is another central branch of the UPR [ 20 XBP1s translocates to the nucleus where it drives the transcription of a wide range of genes dedicated to expanding the ER’s folding capacity, including those for ER chaperones, components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, and enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis to expand the ER membrane. IRE1α also has a second nuclease function, known as IRE1αdependent mRNA decay (RIDD), which degrades specific mRNAs to further reduce the protein load and dampen inflammatory responses [ 21 2.2.3. The ATF6 Pathway The ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) pathway represents the third branch of the UPR [ 20 2.3. The Dual Nature of the UPR The UPR is characterized by its remarkable dual role as a survival and a death pathway [ 22 However, if the stress is chronic or severe, these protective measures prove insufficient. In this scenario, the UPR pivots to a pro-apoptotic program. This transition is mediated by the sustained activation of certain UPR factors, most notably the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP, whose expression is promoted by both the PERK and ATF6 pathways [ 23 CHOP then suppresses the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and induces pro-apoptotic ones, initiating the cell death cascade. This shift from an adaptive to an apoptotic response is a critical mechanism for eliminating irreversibly damaged cells, thereby preventing systemic harm to the organism [ 24 3. ER Stress in Disease Pathogenesis The intricate link between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and human disease is a cornerstone of modern pathology. While the UPR is an essential protective mechanism, its prolonged or dysregulated activation due to chronic ER stress is a key driver of cellular dysfunction, maladaptation, and cell death. The failure to resolve ER stress contributes to the initiation and progression of a wide range of human pathologies, from neurodegeneration to cancer [ 25 Table 1 3.1. Cancer Cancer cells thrive in harsh tumor microenvironments characterized by hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and metabolic stress, all of which are potent inducers of ER stress. Unlike healthy cells, cancer cells often hijack and manipulate the UPR to their advantage. A constitutively active UPR allows these cells to adapt to stress, promoting cell survival, resistance to apoptosis, and chemoresistance [ 26 27 28 29 3.2. Neurodegenerative Diseases A hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease, is the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins, a process that is inextricably linked to ER stress [ 30 In Alzheimer’s, the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles (composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein) directly overloads the ER’s protein-folding machinery. This chronic ER stress, in turn, exacerbates the misfolding and aggregation of these proteins, creating a vicious cycle that leads to synaptic dysfunction and progressive neuronal cell death [ 8 In Parkinson’s, the aggregation of α-synuclein is a major stressor. This accumulation disrupts ER function and impairs the ubiquitin–proteasome system, a key part of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, leading to a buildup of toxic proteins and increased ER stress [ 31 In Huntington’s, the mutant Huntingtin protein undergoes misfolding and aggregation, triggering ER stress that culminates in neuronal apoptosis in specific brain regions. The chronic activation of the pro-apoptotic arm of the UPR, particularly via CHOP, is a major contributor to the progressive loss of neuronal function characteristic of these diseases [ 32 3.3. Metabolic Disorders ER stress is a key pathological feature of major metabolic diseases, acting as a bridge between metabolic imbalances and cellular dysfunction. This state of cellular imbalance is now considered a central hub linking over-nutrition and obesity to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [ 33 In type 2 diabetes, chronic ER stress in insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells impairs their function and ultimately leads to apoptosis via the CHOP pathway, contributing to the decline in insulin production. In parallel, ER stress in the liver and adipose tissue activates inflammatory kinases, such as JNK, which phosphorylate insulin receptor substrates, blocking insulin signaling and inducing a state of insulin resistance [ 33 In obesity and fatty liver disease, the excess nutrient load and lipid accumulation, particularly of saturated fatty acids, directly induce ER stress [ 34 35 36 3.4. Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases The relationship between ER stress and inflammation is bidirectional and central to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. This bidirectional link forms a powerful positive feedback loop: ER stress triggers inflammation, and inflammatory cytokines, in turn, can induce ER stress. This vicious cycle is a key driver of chronic pathology [ 37 38 39 40 3.5. Cardiovascular Diseases ER stress significantly impacts the cardiovascular system, contributing to a range of pathologies [ 41 In atherosclerosis, ER stress in macrophages and endothelial cells promotes lipid uptake, triggers inflammatory signaling, and contributes to the formation of lipid-rich foam cells, a key step in atherosclerotic plaque development [ 42 During myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, the cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation induce severe ER stress, leading to cardiomyocyte dysfunction and apoptosis, a major cause of heart failure [ 43 ER stress can also disrupt calcium handling within the cell, which is essential for cardiac contraction and rhythm, potentially contributing to arrhythmias and a decline in overall cardiac function. The UPR’s adaptive mechanisms can initially protect the heart, but prolonged stress ultimately leads to pathological remodeling and heart failure [ 44 3.6. Respiratory Diseases The ER is a vital organelle in respiratory cells, particularly in airway epithelial cells, alveolar cells, and immune cells, where it is responsible for the synthesis and folding of a vast array of proteins essential for lung function, including mucins, surfactants, and secreted immunoglobulins. When this delicate process is disrupted, a state of ER stress ensues, triggering the UPR to restore homeostasis. The UPR and its pathological dysregulation are now recognized as key contributors to the pathogenesis of several major respiratory diseases. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ER stress is a central mechanism linking cigarette smoke exposure to airway inflammation and emphysema. Inhaled cigarette smoke contains numerous toxic compounds that directly damage ER membranes and disrupt calcium homeostasis, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. This chronic ER stress triggers a sustained and maladaptive UPR. The persistent activation of CHOP, a pro-apoptotic transcription factor, drives the programmed cell death of airway epithelial and alveolar cells, contributing to the progressive destruction of lung parenchyma characteristic of emphysema. Furthermore, the smoke-induced UPR activates inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, which amplifies airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion, which are key features of chronic bronchitis [ 45 46 Understanding ER stress and UPR signaling is crucial for developing targeted therapies to restore cellular homeostasis and mitigate disease progression. 3.7. Viral Infections Viruses are masters at manipulating host cell machinery for their own replication. Many viruses, including hepatitis C and SARS-CoV-2, rely extensively on the host’s ER to synthesize and fold their proteins [ 47 The outcome of ER stress during a viral infection is a delicate balance: the UPR can activate antiviral responses and apoptosis, but it can also be co-opted by the virus to promote its survival and replication [ 48 ijms-26-08814-t001_Table 1 Table 1 This table provides a concise overview of the role of ER stress in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. It highlights how the dysregulation of the UPR, an adaptive mechanism, can become a central driver of cellular dysfunction and disease progression in different pathological contexts. Disease Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress  Cancer Cancer cells hijack the UPR to promote survival, apoptosis resistance, and chemoresistance. The PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 and IRE1α pathways are often activated to adapt to the hostile tumor environment [ 27  Neurodegenerative Diseases Chronic accumulation of misfolded proteins (e.g., Aβ, α-synuclein, mutant Huntingtin protein) overloads the ER, triggering stress. The activation of the pro-apoptotic CHOP arm contributes to progressive neuronal cell death [ 30  Metabolic Disorders (Type 2 Diabetes, Obesity) In pancreatic β-cells, ER stress leads to dysfunction and apoptosis. In the liver and adipose tissue, it induces inflammation and insulin resistance by activating kinases like JNK [ 33  Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases ER stress activates the NF-κB transcription factor, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. UPR dysregulation in immune cells can contribute to the production of autoantibodies [ 37  Cardiovascular Diseases Promotes atherosclerotic plaque formation and contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction and apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion. It can also impair calcium handling and cardiac function [ 41  Respiratory Diseases Cigarette smoke-induced ER stress activates the PERK-CHOP pathway [ 45  Viral Infections Viruses exploit the ER for their protein synthesis, inducing ER stress. They manipulate UPR signaling pathways to enhance their replication and evade the host’s immune response [ 47 4. Natural Products Modulating ER Stress The intricate link between ER stress and numerous pathologies has made the UPR an attractive therapeutic target. In this context, natural products, with their vast chemical diversity and pleiotropic bioactivities, have emerged as a promising avenue for therapeutic development [ 12 4.1. Mechanisms of Action on ER Stress Natural products influence ER stress through a variety of distinct mechanisms, often targeting multiple points within the UPR network to restore cellular homeostasis (see Table 2 Direct Attenuation of ER Stress 49 Modulation of UPR Branches 50 Enhancing ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD) 4.2. Key Examples of Natural Products and Their Effects 4.2.1. Flavonoids and Polyphenols Curcumin: 51 In various cancer models, curcumin can inhibit the pro-survival PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, thereby promoting apoptosis and enhancing the efficacy of conventional therapies [ 52 In contrast, in neurodegenerative and ischemic models, it exhibits neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, indirectly alleviating the ER stress burden [ 53 54 While much of the evidence for its ER stress-modulating effects comes from preclinical studies, its established anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have led to numerous clinical trials. These trials, often in the context of arthritis, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel diseases, show curcumin’s potential to reduce systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are key drivers of ER stress. This clinical evidence, while not always directly measuring UPR markers, supports the hypothesis that curcumin’s broader therapeutic benefits are, in part, mediated by its ability to restore cellular homeostasis [ 55 Resveratrol 56 57 58 59 60 61 Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate 62 EGCG also modulates the UPR by inhibiting the PERK-eIF2α pathway and promoting the IRE1α/XBP1s branch, protecting cells from stress-induced apoptosis [ 63 Recent work [ 64 The broad health benefits of green tea and its extracts, including cardiovascular and cognitive health, are well-documented in human studies [ 65 Quercetin: 66 Research indicates that quercetin specifically attenuates ER stress by modulating the PERK-eIF2α pathway, often by inhibiting the phosphorylation of PERK and its downstream target eIF2α [ 66 In human studies, quercetin has been investigated for its effects on inflammation, cardiovascular risk factors, and immune function [ 67 Oleuropein 68 69 70 Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a flavonoid, that exhibits significant biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties [ 71 Baicalein’s protective effect is often linked to its ability to inhibit PERK phosphorylation, thereby preventing the downstream cascade that leads to eIF2α phosphorylation and subsequent CHOP upregulation. By mitigating the pro-apoptotic arm of the PERK pathway, baicalein helps preserve cell viability and homeostasis [ 72 73 4.2.2. Alkaloids and Saponins Berberine: 74 75 Berberine has been the subject of numerous clinical trials, particularly for its potent effects on blood sugar and lipid profiles in diabetic patients. Clinical studies have shown that berberine is as effective as metformin, a first-line drug for type 2 diabetes, in improving glycemic control, and its therapeutic action is thought to be strongly linked to its ability to attenuate the metabolic ER stress that underlies insulin resistance [ 76 Piperine 77 78 79 80 Ginsenosides 81 Astragaloside IV is a major active saponin derived from the root of Astragalus membranaceus, a plant widely used in traditional Chinese medicine [ 82 83 84 85 4.2.3. Terpenoids and Other Compounds Honokiol 86 87 Ursolic Acid 88 89 90 Camphene 91 92 Sulforaphane 93 71 72 ijms-26-08814-t002_Table 2 Table 2 This table summarizes the primary mechanisms of action of key natural compounds in modulating ER stress and inflammation. The compounds are categorized by their main functions, including inhibition of inflammatory pathways, antioxidant properties, and specific modulation of different branches of the UPR. Natural Compound  Primary Mechanisms of Action Curcumin  Inhibits the pro-survival PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, reduces oxidative stress and inflammation by blocking NF-κB [ 52 Resveratrol  Activates the SIRT1 and AMPK pathways to improve protein folding and energy homeostasis, acts as an antioxidant [ 58 EGCG  Acts as a chemical chaperone, inhibits the PERK-eIF2α pathway and promotes IRE1α/XBP1s, has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [ 63 Quercetin  Potent antioxidant, suppresses the pro-apoptotic CHOP pathway, and modulates inflammatory signaling by inhibiting 66 Oleuropein  Powerful antioxidant that reduces ER stress and protects cells from free radicals [ 68 Baicalein  Alleviates ER stress and modulates UPR based on context (pro-survival vs. pro-apoptotic) [ 73 Berberine  Activates the AMPK pathway, which reduces metabolic ER stress and improves glucose and lipid metabolism [ 74 76 Ginsenosides  Protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP pathway [ 81 Piperine  Exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, modulates ER stress pathways, and inhibits NF-κB [ 80 Astragaloside IV  Inhibits pro-apoptotic pathways, enhances pro-survival GRP78/BiP expression [ 94 Honokiol  Inhibits the IRE1α branch of the UPR, suppressing pro-survival signals in cancer cells [ 87 Ursolic Acid  Alleviates ER stress by down-regulating pro-apoptotic UPR proteins and promoting the expression of protective genes [ 89 Camphene  Induces ER stress, modulates UPR [ 92 Sulforaphane  Activates the Nrf2 pathway, a master regulator of antioxidant and detoxifying genes, thereby indirectly alleviating ER stress [ 72 5. Challenges and Future Directions The investigation of natural products as modulators of ER stress presents both significant promise and notable challenges. While the potential for novel therapeutics is vast, a number of hurdles must be overcome to effectively translate preclinical findings into clinical applications (see also Table 3 5.1. Challenges in Research and Development The journey from a plant-derived compound to a clinically viable drug is complex, and several inherent factors complicate this process specifically for natural ER stress modulators. One of the most significant obstacles is a fundamental issue of bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Many of these potent compounds, particularly polyphenols, were not evolved to be absorbed by the human digestive system in therapeutic doses [ 56 The use of natural extracts introduces significant variability, as their chemical composition and potency can change based on the plant’s origin, growing conditions, harvest time, and extraction methods [ 95 Furthermore, the very strength of many natural compounds—their complexity of action—can also be a weakness. While their multi-target effects can offer a holistic therapeutic benefit, they also make it scientifically challenging to pinpoint the precise mechanism of action. This complexity hinders the development of targeted, specific therapies, as it can be difficult to determine which of the many pathways influenced by a compound is most critical for its therapeutic effect. Finally, a major bottleneck is the scarcity of robust human clinical trials [ 82 5.2. Future Perspectives Addressing these challenges requires a concerted, multi-disciplinary effort. The future of natural product research as a therapeutic strategy for ER stress hinges on several key directions aimed at overcoming these barriers. Advanced technologies in novel natural product discovery are moving the field beyond well-known compounds. High-throughput screening, coupled with computational biology and genomics, will allow researchers to more efficiently screen vast libraries of natural products from diverse sources to identify new lead molecules with more favorable properties. The next logical step involves in-depth structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies [ 83 One of the most promising solutions to the bioavailability challenge lies in advanced delivery systems, particularly in the field of nanotechnology [ 84 Furthermore, the multi-target nature of natural products makes them ideal candidates for combination therapies [ 85 Ultimately, bridging the gap between promising lab results and patient care requires a commitment to rigorous preclinical and clinical validation. More sophisticated, well-designed, and standardized studies are essential to provide the robust evidence required for regulatory approval and widespread therapeutic use. By embracing these future directions, the scientific community can harness the vast potential of natural products to create a new generation of drugs for ER stress-related diseases. This concerted effort is the crucial next step in translating a historical wealth of knowledge into modern, effective therapies. ijms-26-08814-t003_Table 3 Table 3 This table provides a concise summary of the key challenges and future directions discussed. It outlines the main hurdles in the research and therapeutic application of natural compounds as ER stress modulators and highlights the innovative solutions and strategies being pursued to overcome them. Aspect Challenges Future Solutions Natural Compounds Low bioavailability, variability, complex mechanisms of action. Semi-synthetic derivatives, advanced delivery systems (nanotechnology). Research Poor reproducibility, difficulty isolating specific mechanisms. High-throughput screening, SAR (structure–activity relationship) studies. Therapeutic Development Lack of robust clinical trials and clear regulatory pathways. Combination therapies, rigorous and standardized clinical validation. 6. Conclusions The evidence compiled in this review highlights the critical role of ER stress in a wide array of human diseases. The dysregulation of the UPR, a central pathological mechanism with a dual capacity for survival and apoptosis, is a key determinant of cell fate, making it a compelling target for therapeutic intervention across conditions ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer and metabolic disorders. The therapeutic potential of natural products as ER stress modulators is significant. They represent more than just traditional remedies; they are a rich and diverse source of chemical scaffolds for novel drug discovery. While the multi-target nature of these compounds presents a challenge for scientific elucidation, it also provides a unique advantage in clinical practice by offering a holistic approach to complex pathologies. Compounds like curcumin, resveratrol, and sulforaphane exemplify this potential, demonstrating diverse mechanisms for rebalancing the UPR and protecting cells from chronic stress. In conclusion, the path forward necessitates a renewed commitment to rigorous research. The existing challenges of poor bioavailability, lack of standardization, and a scarcity of clinical validation are substantial but not insurmountable. By leveraging modern scientific tools, including advanced screening technologies, nanotechnology-based delivery systems, and precision medicine, the full therapeutic potential of these compounds can be unlocked. The continued exploration of natural products as ER stress-targeting agents holds the key to a new generation of effective, safe, and potentially more personalized therapies for some of humanity’s most debilitating diseases.
