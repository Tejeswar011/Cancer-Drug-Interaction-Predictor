Introduction Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus in the Coronaviridae family commonly found in domestic cats [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7 8 Edible mushrooms have been reported to possess multiple biomedical properties, including antiviral, anti-inflammatory activities, and immunomodulatory effects through cytokine stimulation [ 7 8 8 In the preliminary inflammation model of this study, both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and FIPV (or viruses in general) are potent activators of the NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathways [ 9 10 11 12 13 Figure 1 Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that hijack the host’s translational machinery to generate viral proteins. The resulting polyproteins must be cleaved to release individual functional proteins necessary for viral replication and transcription. The virus encodes proteases, including the main protease (M pro 14 pro 15 pro 14 16 The immune system plays a crucial role in controlling viral infections, including the suppression of FCoV replication and prevention of progression to FIP. In this study, 17 mushroom extracts were screened as potential candidates for alternative immunomodulatory strategies in cats. Screening was conducted to assess antiviral activity by them against FIPV M pro 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethics Statement This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand, under protocol number ACKU67-VET-124. Additionally, all sample collections were performed with the informed consent of the cat owners. 2.2.

This model was employed to identify mushroom extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory activity against the FIPV M pro 2.4. Animals and Experimental Design This research was approved for sample collection from the Kasetsart University Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. PBMCs were isolated from healthy donor cats ( n 18 19 n 20 2.5. The Preparation of the Mushroom Extraction Procedure A total of 17 types of medical mushrooms were selected, including Pleurotus ostreatus Flammulina filiformis Agrocybe cylindracea Lentinula edodes Tuber Uncinatum Lignosus rhinocerotis Volvariella volvacea Ganoderma oregonense Ganoderma formosanum Ganoderma lucidum Inonotus obliquus Hericium erinaceus Psilocybe cubensis Phellinus igniarius Dasoclema simensis Pleurotus ostreatus, Phallus indusiatus pro 21 2.6. Preparation of PBMCs Whole blood from healthy donor cats and effusion samples (pleural, ascitic, or both) from FIP cats were processed to isolate PBMCs by separating the buffy coats using centrifugation with Lymphoprep™ (Corning ® ® ® ® 6 ® In the case of isolating PBMCs from effusion samples, referred to in this study as “PBMCs from FIP fluid” the sample characteristics of the FIP fluid were carefully considered. If the sample exhibited high viscosity, it was diluted with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Cytiva HyClone™, USA) to facilitate efficient cell pelleting. The diluted sample was then centrifuged at 600× g g 2.7.

Optimization of PBMC Culture Conditions Using Whole Blood Samples and FIP Fluid The characteristics of PBMCs isolated from both whole blood of donor cat and FIP fluid revealed that PBMCs from whole blood contained a small number of platelets and red blood cell contamination ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 The experimental results show that at a DMSO concentration of 0.5%, the viability of PBMCs (1 × 10 6 Figure S1 The viability assessment of PBMCs (1 × 10 6 A comparison of PBMC viability isolated from both whole blood and FIP fluid was performed using a two-way ANOVA ( p Figure 5 However, in this study, PBMCs isolated from samples will be used for testing within 24 h, as they exhibit the highest cell viability, exceeding 90% [ 22 3.4. LPS-Stimulated PBMCs PBMCs isolated from donor cat blood samples were stimulated with LPS at concentrations ranging from 1 to 0.001 µg/mL for 24 h. Cell viability and proliferation were then assessed using the CCK-8 colorimetric assay. The results showed that increasing LPS concentrations significantly enhanced cell viability. In the control group without LPS stimulation, cell viability was 91.60 ± 0.85%, whereas at the highest LPS concentration (1 µg/mL), cell viability increased to 99.21 ± 0.10% ( Figure 6 Subsequently, a comparison of PBMCs viability at each concentration with the control group without LPS addition revealed that at a concentration of 0.001 µg/mL, there was no statistically significant difference compared to the control group. However, at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 µg/mL, there were statistically significant differences from the control group ( Figure 6 3.5.

Discussion In this study, the FIPV M pro pro Figure 2 pro pro 28 The present study revealed a significant finding: the mushroom extract demonstrated FIPV protease inhibition at 69.2%, indicating its potential as a natural source of antiviral compounds. This activity is slightly lower than both ritonavir (71.88%) and lopinavir (84.13%), both of which are established broad-spectrum protease inhibitors clinically used in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) therapy [ 29 Figure 3 pro 30 31 32 33 pro 34 35 The experimental results revealed that P. indusiatus pro Figure 3 pro pro pro 35 36 37 37 38 39 pro pro 16 Mushroom extracts are widely recognized for their antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties [ 40 41 42 43 44 Ganoderma lucidum 45 P. indusiatus pro P. indusiatus The PBMCs isolated from both the whole blood of donor cats and FIP fluid, characterized by monocytes and macrophages, are essential components of the innate immune system [ 46 47 48 Figure 4 49 22 Figure 5 In the present study, we employed LPS to activate PBMCs as a model of inflammation. LPS, commonly referred to as endotoxin, is a potent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) derived from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It is recognized primarily by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressed on the surface of immune cells, including monocytes/macrophages [ 50 51 9 50 52 53 54 55 56 10 11 Figure 1 The innate immune system’s ability to initiate responses to LPS was also examined [ 57 Figure 6 58 59 60 61 59 60 61 23 62 63 The effect of P. indusiatus 64 65 66 67 68 50 51 Figure 7 50 52 68 P. indusiatus Figure 7 The test on the reduction of nitrite production by PBMCs isolated from FIP fluid ( Figure 7 69 54 70 71 72 73 Figure 7 74 75 The results of this study show a statistically significant difference in the response to treatments between PBMCs isolated from whole blood and those from FIP fluid. PBMCs from whole blood responded to both treatments (dexamethasone and P. indusiatus Figure 7 23 54 62 63 69 52 57 76 77 54 55 56 10 11 54 56 78 79 P. indusiatus 7 80 P. indusiatus 81 82 Limitations of this study include, firstly, the use of LPS as a model of a general inflammatory stimulus instead of direct FIPV infection. Although both can activate similar inflammatory pathways (e.g., NF-κB leading to TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS expression). FIPV infection is more complex, involving intricate virus–host interactions that LPS cannot fully mimic. Secondly, attempts to develop an in vitro FIPV infection model were unsuccessful. Although efforts were made to establish an FIPV infection model by infecting CRFK (Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney) cells in vitro, these attempts failed due to challenges in isolating the virus from FIP fluid samples, difficulties in quantifying viral load, and the inconsistency of infection. As a result of these limitations, it was not possible to use the actual virus in the study, making it necessary to rely on the LPS-based simulation system, which may not fully reflect the true nature of FIPV infection. Future investigations may consider employing alternative approaches to better mimic the natural course of FIPV infection. For example, pseudotyped viral systems expressing the FIPV spike protein could provide a safe and controllable platform for examining viral entry and replication, while FIPV-infected cell lines may offer a more physiologically relevant model for studying virus–host interactions [ 83 84 Despite this, this study represents the first preliminary investigation to evaluate extracts from the mushroom P. indusiatus pro pro Future research should focus on elucidating the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) and other relevant inflammatory mediators involved in the pathogenesis of FIP.
