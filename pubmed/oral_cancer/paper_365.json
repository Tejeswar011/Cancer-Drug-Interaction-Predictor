Summary Background Oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can effectively reduce HIV incidence. A 2020–21 demonstration project assessed the feasibility and health outcomes of offering oral PrEP to men who have sex with men (MSM) in Cotonou, Benin. We evaluated the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of this project and the potential scale-up of oral HIV PrEP for MSM in Cotonou. Methods We calibrated an HIV transmission-dynamic model structured by age and risk within a Bayesian framework to MSM-specific HIV prevalence and treatment data, parameterised with project behavioural and cost (including PrEP drug, implementation, and HIV care costs) data. We estimated the impact and cost-effectiveness of the 2020–21 Cotonou demonstration project (PrEP coverage, 5–10% of all MSM who are not living with HIV in Grand Cotonou; and adherence, 13–21% taking at least four of seven required doses [ie, at least four doses per week for daily users and at least four of seven expected doses given reported sexual activity for on-demand users]) and of its potential scale-up over 5 years (from 2022 to 2027), reaching 30% coverage of MSM in Grand Cotonou and with demonstration project adherence levels. We additionally modelled ideal PrEP adherence (100% taking at least four of seven required doses). We estimated the percentage of cumulative new HIV infections averted among participating MSM over 1 year and among all MSM in Grand Cotonou and their female partners over 20 years, and cost-effectiveness as cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted over 20 years. Costs and DALYs were discounted 3% annually. Findings We found that the demonstration project averted an estimated 21·5% (95% uncertainty interval 16·6 to 26·2) of HIV infections among participants over 1 year. With ideal adherence, cases that would be averted increased to 95·2% (90·8 to 98·8). A 5-year PrEP scale-up could avert 3·2% (1·6 to 4·8) of HIV infections among all MSM and female partners over 20 years, at US$388 (36 to 2792) per DALY averted. With ideal adherence, this decreased to −$28 (−126 to 589) per DALY averted. Interpretation Low adherence to PrEP restricted the impact of the demonstration project. At 30% coverage among MSM by 2027, PrEP scale-up would be cost-effective at a $1225 threshold with 86·6% probability, and it could be more cost-effective if high adherence could be reached without substantially increasing costs.

We evaluated the 20-year impact of the 1-year MSM PrEP demonstration project in Cotonou in 2020–21, and of scaling up PrEP to the wider MSM population of Cotonou and Abomey-Calavi from 2022 to 2027. Methods Model structure We used a deterministic compartmental model of HIV transmission among MSM aged 18–50 years in Cotonou and Abomey-Calavi (Grand Cotonou), Benin. The model was adapted from a US model 12 appendix 2 10 13 HIV transmission between MSM occurred in non-commercial or commercial partnerships. HIV transmission from MSM to female partners occurred in stable or casual partnerships. Sex act frequency and condom usage varied by partnership type. Per capita rates of HIV acquisition among MSM, and of HIV transmission to female partners, depended on partnership change rates, number of sex acts per partnership (per non-commercial or commercial partnership with MSM partners, and per stable or casual partnership with female partners), transmission probabilities per act, proportion of condom-protected acts, HIV prevalence, infection stage, viral suppression levels, PrEP use, and PrEP effectiveness among MSM. Model details, schematics, and equations are given in appendix 2 Modelling PrEP Daily and on-demand PrEP regimens were modelled to reflect the demonstration project, including regimen switching and discontinuation. We calculated the effectiveness of each regimen against HIV acquisition as a weighted average over three PrEP adherence strata, using strata-specific efficacies from PrEP trials (fully adherent 90–100%, partly adherent 56–96%, and non-adherent 0% 6 appendix 2 Model parameters and data sources Demographic parameters were drawn from UN World Population Prospects estimates for Benin. 14 10 15 16 appendix 2 table appendix 2 appendix 2 Model calibration The model was calibrated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to data from biobehavioural surveys of MSM in Grand Cotonou on population size, age distribution, overall HIV prevalence (our main scenario) or age-stratified prevalence (sensitivity analysis), antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, viral suppression, and the proportion of MSM aged 25–50 years who had never tested for HIV ( table appendix 2 appendix 2 PrEP scenarios We modelled two PrEP intervention scenarios. First, a 1-year demonstration project, in which 163 MSM were initiated onto daily PrEP and 41 onto on-demand PrEP for 1 year from 2020 (5–10% of HIV-negative MSM in Grand Cotonou). Second, a 5-year PrEP scale-up, in which from 2022, MSM not living with HIV were routinely offered the choice of daily or on-demand PrEP upon testing for HIV, and we calibrated the probability of accepting PrEP to obtain scenarios of 10%, 30%, and 50% coverage among MSM not living with HIV by 2027 ( appendix 2 Model outcomes We measured impact as the cumulative number of new HIV infections averted among all MSM aged 18–50 years and their female partners over 20 years compared with the counterfactual without PrEP. For the demonstration project, we also estimated the number of new HIV infections averted over 1 year among project participants. For each scenario, we estimated the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted over 20 years by comparing the number of years lived with disease and years of life lost (YLL) due to HIV infection with the counterfactual without PrEP, using 2019 Global Burden of Disease weights. 18 For each PrEP scenario, we calculated the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), ie, the cost per DALY averted compared with the counterfactual without PrEP, over 20 years. We compared the ICER with willingness-to-pay thresholds of 1 × Benin gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (US$1225), the previous WHO threshold for very cost-effective interventions, 19 20 Model outcomes are expressed as median values and 95% uncertainty intervals based on 1000 runs. Output equations are detailed in appendix 2 Cost assumptions We used a bottom-up costing approach to estimate costs from the perspective of the Benin Ministry of Health. We included PrEP drug and implementation costs (from the demonstration project 10 17 appendix 2 appendix 2 21 Demonstration project costs in Communauté Financière Africaine francs were converted to US$ using an exchange rate from April 28, 2021 (the project midpoint). ART costs, lifetime HIV care costs, and cost-effectiveness thresholds were adjusted to US$ at 2021 values using the World Bank Benin inflation index. 22 table appendix 2 Sensitivity analysis We considered a range of scenarios assessing the sensitivity of our main results to modelling assumptions, and to PrEP adherence and coverage ( appendix 2 appendix 2 Biobehavioural surveys report higher HIV prevalence among MSM aged 18–24 years than MSM aged 25–50 years in 2017 15 16 We also assessed the sensitivity of results to the inclusion or exclusion of HIV infections among female partners, risk prioritisation (offering PrEP to MSM at high risk only), implementation costs, lifetime HIV care costs, discount rates, DALY calculation method (considering an alternative calculation whereby YLL after the intervention evaluation period are not included 23 vs Threshold analysis We considered the relative change in PrEP costs during PrEP scale-up required to reach an ICER below a 1 × GDP per capita threshold.

Results The calibrated model reflected the epidemiological HIV and treatment data available for MSM in Cotonou, Benin well, as well as their uncertainty, which resulted in a wide range of plausible future epidemic trajectories ( figure 1 appendix 2 figure 1 appendix 2 Our results suggest that the demonstration project averted 21·5% (95% uncertainty interval 16·6–26·2) participant HIV infections over 1 year in our main adherence scenario, 37·0% (31·2–42·9) in our optimistic scenario, and 95·2% (90·8–98·8) in our ideal scenario ( figure 2A The 1-year project (which enrolled 204 [5–10%] of all MSM not living with HIV in Grand Cotonou) was estimated to avert a total of three (95% uncertainty interval 1–5) new HIV infections among MSM and one (0–2) among their female partners over 20 years ( figure 2B figure 2C appendix 2 The demonstration project averted an estimated 34·0 (95% uncertainty interval 10·5–79·6) DALYs at a net cost of $61 688 (56 712–64 973) over 20 years ( figure 2D E figure 2F appendix 2 appendix 2 A 5-year PrEP scale-up reaching 30% PrEP coverage of HIV-uninfected MSM in Grand Cotonou by 2027 could avert 3·2% (95% uncertainty interval 1·6–4·8) of all HIV infections among MSM and their female partners over 20 years under our main adherence scenario, 5·3% (2·8–7·5) under our optimistic scenario, and 12·5% (6·7–16·9) under our ideal scenario ( figure 3A figure 3A appendix 2 Over 20 years, a 5-year scale-up with 30% PrEP coverage by 2027 could avert 570 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval 111 to 1628; figure 3B figure 3C figure 3D figure 3D appendix 2 appendix 2 figure 4 The median ICER of the 5-year PrEP scale-up was closer to the 0·29 × GDP than the 1 × GDP threshold for most sensitivity analysis scenarios, and was lower for eight scenarios: optimistic adherence, ideal adherence, risk prioritisation, a 50-year evaluation period, DALYs not being discounted, DALYs and costs not being discounted, higher lifetime HIV care costs, and alternative calibration to age-specific prevalence. These ICER values were lower because more DALYs were averted or lower incremental costs were incurred than in the main scenario ( appendix 2 The median ICER of a 20-year scale-up of our main cost-effectiveness scenario fell just below the 1 × GDP threshold. Because we used a 20-year intervention evaluation period, the health benefits of offering PrEP towards the end of the 20-year scale-up are not fully captured, resulting in a higher ICER than a 5-year PrEP scale-up. The median ICER fell below a 0·29 × GDP threshold for scenarios of ideal adherence, 50-year evaluation period, and higher lifetime HIV costs. Notably, similar ICERs were obtained for a 5-year and 20-year scale-up when evaluated over 50 years. For the 1-year demonstration project, only ideal adherence resulted in a median ICER below 0·29 × GDP ( appendix 2 Combined initiation and ongoing PrEP costs would have to be under 2·5 times their PrEP scale-up value (95% uncertainty 0·5–7·1) under our main adherence scenario, 4·1 times (0·8–11·3) under our optimistic scenario, and 9·4 times (1·8–26·1) under our ideal scenario to keep the ICER of PrEP scale-up below 1 × GDP ( table appendix 2 Discussion Our modelling suggests that the Cotonou PrEP demonstration project might have averted around one-fifth of HIV infections among participating MSM over 1 year. However, the project impact was hindered by low adherence levels observed among participants (13–21% taking at least four of seven prescribed doses). A 5-year PrEP scale-up reaching 30% coverage by 2027 could avert 2–5% of infections among MSM and their female partners over 20 years. Based on the median ICER, PrEP scale-up (at 10%, 30%, and 50% coverage by 2027) was cost-effective at a 1 × GDP ($1225) threshold, but the demonstration project was not. At a 0·29 × GDP ($355) threshold, PrEP scale-up was cost-effective in 46·2% of model runs under our main adherence scenario. The potential impact of PrEP scale-up depends on coverage reached, which will partly depend on PrEP acceptability. In an acceptability study in Benin, 90% of surveyed MSM, once well informed, indicated that they would use PrEP. 24 24 25 PrEP adherence was a key determinant of cost-effectiveness in this study. In an ideal—arguably unrealistic—adherence scenario (at no extra cost), both demonstration project and PrEP scale-up were cost-effective at both thresholds considered. Our threshold analysis suggested that even with substantially higher PrEP costs, PrEP could remain cost-effective (at a 1 × GDP threshold) with high adherence levels, highlighting the importance of understanding how to improve adherence. Our model assumed that non-adherent PrEP users receive no benefit, but assuming partial protection would increase the cost-effectiveness of PrEP. Our results are similar to those of other PrEP modelling studies for key populations in west and central Africa. A study modelling oral PrEP for female sex workers in Cotonou also reported very minor long-term effects of a 2-year demonstration project in female sex workers due to low observed adherence. In that study, the PrEP scale-up scenarios considered were unlikely to be cost-effective, mainly due to relatively low HIV incidence 17 26 27 Models that represent population-specific context help refine our understanding of the effect of HIV interventions. Through calibration to MSM-specific and context-specific data, our model reflected plausible HIV trends among MSM in Grand Cotonou, with the wide range of modelled epidemiological trajectories reflecting the uncertainty in underlying data. Our PrEP impact estimates could apply to other settings with similar behavioural characteristics and adherence levels among MSM PrEP users. Consistent with previous studies, 8 28 Although the median ICER of PrEP scale-up did not fall below a 0·29 × GDP threshold under our main scenario evaluated over 20 years, the median ICER of both a 5-year and a 20-year PrEP scale-up fell below this threshold when evaluated over 50 years because more DALYs were averted and greater savings in HIV care costs were accrued, highlighting the large effect the intervention evaluation period can have on PrEP cost-effectiveness estimates. 9 23 This study focused on oral PrEP, the only modality currently available in Benin. Our study shows that PrEP scale-up is likely to be cost-effective (at a 1 × GDP threshold) if offered for a fixed period before long-acting injectable PrEP becomes available. It will be important for future studies to evaluate the relative impact and cost-effectiveness of long-acting PrEP compared with oral PrEP. Given the low PrEP adherence observed during the demonstration project, long-acting PrEP has the potential to improve impact. However, uncertainty remains over the costs of injectable modalities, which will be required to evaluate cost-effectiveness. Our study has several limitations. First, behavioural parameters were based on survey responses of MSM recruited via respondent-driven sampling, which, despite being the gold standard to sample key populations, 29 21 30 In summary, our modelling suggests that low adherence to oral PrEP hampered the impact of the 1-year demonstration project. However, despite low adherence, a 5-year PrEP scale-up from 2022 would be expected to be cost-effective at a 1 × GDP cost-effectiveness threshold, and such a scale-up could fall below a 0·29 × GDP threshold if high adherence can be ensured without substantially increasing implementation costs. Our results highlight that oral PrEP can be a useful HIV intervention for MSM in Cotonou, particularly in the period before long-acting injectable PrEP is introduced.

Research in context Evidence before this study A 12020–21 demonstration project assessed the feasibility and health outcomes of offering oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to men who have sex with men (MSM) in Cotonou, Benin. We searched PubMed for articles estimating the population-level impact or cost-effectiveness of offering PrEP to MSM in west Africa between Jan 1, 2012, and Oct 1, 2024, using the following search terms for titles and abstracts: (“PrEP” OR “pre-exposure prophylaxis”) AND (“HIV” OR “AIDS”) AND (“Benin” OR “Burkina Faso” OR “Cabo Verde” OR “Cape Verde” OR “Cote D’Ivoire” OR “Ivory Coast” OR “Gambia” OR “Ghana” OR “Guinea” OR “Guinea-Bissau” OR “Liberia” OR “Mauritania” OR “Niger” OR “Nigeria” OR “Senegal” OR “Sierra Leone” OR “West Africa”) AND (“men who have sex with men” OR “MSM” OR “gay” OR “homosexual” OR “bisexual” OR “same-sex”). None of the 44 studies identified estimated the impact of PrEP for MSM in Benin or west Africa. Added value of this study We used an HIV transmission-dynamic model, parametrised with relevant data collected during the 2020–21 Cotonou demonstration project on behaviour, PrEP adherence, regimen choice, and retention. With this model, we estimated the impact of the 2020–21 demonstration project itself, as well as the scale-up of oral PrEP to MSM in Cotonou and Abomey-Calavi, Benin. Given the low adherence levels, as observed during the demonstration project, and the short project duration, the long-term effect of the PrEP demonstration project on HIV incidence was low. However, scaling up PrEP for 5 years to reach 30% coverage by 2027 could avert 2–5% of all HIV infections among MSM and their female partners over 20 years. To our knowledge, our study provides the first cost-effectiveness estimates of oral PrEP for MSM in west Africa. At the low adherence levels observed during the demonstration project, PrEP scale-up has an 87% probability of being cost-effective at the WHO threshold for cost-effectiveness (1 × Benin gross domestic product [GDP] per capita, US$1225) but only has a 46% probability of being cost-effective at a Benin-specific threshold based on health opportunity costs (0·29 × GDP per capita, $355). However, PrEP would be likely to be cost-effective at this threshold if high levels of adherence (all PrEP users taking at least four out of seven required doses) could be reached. Implications of all the available evidence At sufficient scale, PrEP could help to reduce new HIV infections among MSM in Benin. Scaling up PrEP is likely to be a cost-effective intervention for MSM in Benin (at 1 × GDP per capita threshold), and it could become more cost-effective if adherence can be considerably improved through tailored interventions without substantially increasing costs.
