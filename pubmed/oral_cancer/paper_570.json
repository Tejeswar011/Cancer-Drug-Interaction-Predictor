Conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens come with significant drawbacks, including high toxicity, adverse side effects, inadequate targeting ability, and the potential for developing drug resistance, which ultimately diminishes patients' overall well‐being. Methods Food and medicine homology substances exhibit favorable pharmacological activity and minimal toxic side effects. They comprise a range of components that are beneficial to the human body, including high‐quality proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other biologically active components such as polysaccharides, flavonoids, saponins, and alkaloids. In recent years, they have attracted considerable attention in the field of GC prevention and treatment. A comprehensive review of extant literature, alongside a rigorous analysis of contemporary nutrition and traditional Chinese medicine, forms the foundation of this study. Results Its systematic approach encompasses the examination of the effects and mechanisms of food and medicine homology substances and their active ingredients on the prophylaxis and therapy of GC. Conclusions The study's findings expand the cognitive boundaries of GC prevention and improvement and offer novel insights and directions for the development of clinical anticancer therapeutic drugs. active ingredients food and medicine homology substances gastric cancer mechanisms of action Special Project of the Central Government in Guidance of Local Science and Technology Development of the Xizang Autonomous Region XZ202401YD0010 Science and Technology Projects of Xizang Autonomous Region, China XZ202501JD0007 Natural Science Foundation of Xizang Autonomous Region XZ202401ZR0130 Xizang University for Nationalities Intramural Research Project 22MDY06 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  Z.

The mechanisms of these substances against GC were then analyzed in terms of antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and anti‐ H. pylori 2 Food and Medicine Homology Substances and Their Bioactive Components for the Prevention and Treatment of GC In recent years, a growing body of research has identified the medicinal properties of numerous foods. These foods have been utilized to enhance human immunity and prevent diseases through dietary therapy, dietary supplementation, or medicinal diets. These findings underscore the dual properties of food and medicine homology substances and have garnered international attention in the field of herbal medicine research due to their low toxicity, high efficiency, and long‐term clinical references [ 30 31 32 As depicted in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Food and medicine homology substances with preventive and therapeutic effects on GC. 3 Mechanism of Action of Food and Medicine Homology Substances and Their Active Ingredients on GC 3.1 Antioxidant Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of GC [ 33 34 35 36 Oligofructose (FOS) is a prebiotic that can be extracted from the seeds of Coix lachryma‐jobi 37 38 Polygonatum sibiricum 39  Platycodon grandiflorus 2 2 40 41 42 43 44 45 46  Portulaca oleracea 47 48 49 3.2 Anti‐Inflammatory The present study hypothesizes that chronic inflammation is a contributing factor to the development of GC. Inflammatory factors contribute to the development and progression of GC by regulating angiogenic and adhesion molecules, tumor metastasis, and improving drug resistance [ 50 16 30   Platycodon grandiflorus 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 3.3 Anti‐  H.

[ 78 Dendrobium 79 Dendrobium officinale 80 81 82 55 83 Excessive secretion of gastric acid has been identified as an essential factor in the development of GC. Gastrin, a hormone that stimulates acid secretion in the stomach, has been demonstrated to serve as a potential marker for the diagnosis of this condition [ 84 85 86 3.5 Immunomodulation The immune system plays a pivotal role in tumor surveillance and clearance [ 87 88 89 90 91 92 A number of studies have indicated that polysaccharides may impede the progression of GC by enhancing the intestinal microbiome, thereby potentiating immune system function [ 42 93 94 95 96 46  Glycyrrhiza glabra + + + + 97 Bacteroides 98  Platycodon grandiflorus 99 3.6 Induction of Apoptosis, Inhibition of Cellular Proliferation, and Migration 3.6.1 Induction of Apoptosis Apoptosis is a classical mechanism of programmed cell death [ 100 101 102 Astragalus is a widely used medicinal food homology substance. A soluble polysaccharide (SPS4) isolated from Astragalus can increase ROS accumulation in vivo to release cytochrome C, decrease mitochondrial membrane potential, and elevate the proapoptotic/antiapoptotic (Bax/Bcl‐2) ratio, thus exerting an obvious apoptosis‐inducing effect on the GC MGC‐803 cells [ 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110  Ginkgo biloba 111 112 113 114 115  lilium lancifolium  lilium lancifolium 29 116 3.6.2 Inhibition of Cell Proliferation and Migration A significant challenge in the realm of tumor suppression and cancer treatment is the capacity of tumors to invade and metastasize. Tumor invasion and metastasis have been identified as significant contributors to the decline in cancer patients' quality of life and are even the primary causes of mortality in this demographic [ 117 Saffronin, a key bioactive compound found in saffron, has been shown to suppress epithelial–mesenchymal transition while curbing the invasive and migratory behavior of GC cells. This effect occurs through the upregulation of KLF5, HIF‐1α, and miR‐320 signaling pathways in both GC tissues and cellular environments [ 118 43 119 120 121 122 123 124  Platycodon grandiflorus 125  Platycodon grandiflorus 126 127 H. pylori 128 129 130 131 132  Codonopsis pilosula 133 134 135 4 Summary and Outlook Through an extensive review of the literature, this study identifies licorice as a remarkable food and medicine homology substances, demonstrating significant anti‐ H. pylori The review investigates the potential of food and medicine homology substances to prevent and treat GC through multitargeted, holistic regulation of the organism. The properties of these substances include antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and anti‐  H. pylori 1 TABLE 1 Food and medicine homology substances and their bioactive components with prevention and treatment of GC.
