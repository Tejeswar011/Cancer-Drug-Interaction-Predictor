This review explores how changes in the metabolic and immune microenvironment of OSCC can serve as biomarkers for early detection and as targets for precision therapies. By providing metabolomic and immunological insights, we aim to guide the development of non-invasive diagnostics and personalized treatments to improve patient outcomes. Abstract Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant neoplasm of the oral epithelium that constitutes majority of oral cancers and is strongly associated with risk factors such as tobacco use and genetic alterations. Mortality rates for OSCC are high because many cases are misdiagnosed or identified at later stages, and treatment options are limited with high recurrence. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. OSCC tumor cells, like those in other solid malignancies, exhibit significant alterations in metabolic pathways and the immune microenvironment. These changes can serve as valuable biomarkers for early detection and as targets for innovative treatment strategies. This review summarizes the current understanding of metabolic and immunological biomarkers that are either currently in use for OSCC or are in different phases of clinical trials. oral squamous cell carcinoma metabolome proteome biomarkers therapeutic targets immunotherapy Institute of Eminence Grant of Banaras Hindu University (BHU-IoE) Office of Director, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University The research in the authors’ laboratory was supported through the funding from the Institute of Eminence Grant of Banaras Hindu University (BHU-IoE).

Introduction Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) originates in the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and is an aggressive malignancy with a high propensity for regional and distant metastasis via the lymphatic system [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4 11 12 13 Survival rates for patients with OSCC vary widely depending on the stage at diagnosis. Early-stage (stage I) detection is associated with high survival rates (about 80%), but these rates drop to 20–30% for late stage (stage III–IV) diagnosis [ 14 15 16 17 This narrative review provides an up-to-date, in-depth summary of important metabolic and immunological biomarkers in OSCC, emphasizing how alterations in glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism alongside immune interactions shape disease progression and therapeutic response. The literature search was conducted using broad queries across key scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, focusing on recent publications up to 2024. Search terms included combinations of “oral squamous cell carcinoma,” “OSCC”, “metabolic biomarkers,” “immunological biomarkers,” “metabolomics,” and “immunotherapy.” The literature was selected based on relevance, recency, and an emphasis on translational and clinical significance. Unlike previous reviews, we offer a comprehensive integration of these biomarker classes, with particular focus on their crosstalk, translational challenges, and the promise of non-invasive diagnostics, multi-omics, and AI-driven approaches for advancing clinical practice. By systematically examining how metabolic reprogramming and immune microenvironmental changes converge in OSCC, we aim to bridge the gap between biomarker discovery and clinical implementation, guiding the development of more effective strategies for early detection and personalized therapy. 2. Metabolic Alterations and Therapeutic Targeting in OSCC Metabolic reprogramming is a central hallmark of OSCC, driving tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis [ 18 19 20 21 22 A key gap in OSCC diagnostics is the inability of current methods to reliably distinguish between potentially precancerous oral lesions, such as Oral Erosive Lichen Planus (OELP), Oral Lichen Planus (OLP), and Oral Leukoplakia (OLK). While OELP and OLP are autoimmune inflammatory conditions, OLK is characterized by white patches with a higher risk of malignant transformation to OSCC [ 23 Table 1 24 Figure 1 2.1. Dysfunctional Amino Acid Metabolism Altered amino acid (AA) metabolism is a defining feature of OSCC, impacting both disease progression and diagnostic strategies [ 25 26 27 28 29 Glutamine metabolism is particularly pivotal in OSCC, fueling nucleotide synthesis (purines and pyrimidines), glycosylation via glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P), and redox homeostasis through glutamate conversion which enters the TCA cycle, generates NADPH (via glutamate dehydrogenase) to mitigate oxidative stress, and supports glutathione biosynthesis, a critical antioxidant defense [ 30 31 32 33 34 2.2. Lipid-Choline Metabolism Choline metabolism is a crucial component of lipid metabolism, and its disruption is strongly linked to the development of OSCC. In OSCC, choline metabolism becomes activated, leading to elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine—a key member for membrane synthesis and tumor growth. Metabolomic profiling using NMR and UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap HRMS has revealed significant alterations in choline-related pathways, notably reduced free choline and increased trimethylamine N-oxide in serum, both of which serve as metabolic signatures of OSCC. The diagnostic potential of choline derivatives has been highlighted by studies demonstrating that metabolomic analysis of saliva and serum can effectively detect these disruptions during oral carcinogenesis [ 35 36 37 p 38 39 Beyond choline metabolism, lipid metabolism, as a whole, is significantly dysregulated in OSCC. This is driven by the rapid proliferation of cancer cells, which requires increased lipids for membrane synthesis, energy production, and signaling [ 40 18 41 42 43 De novo FA synthesis, a hallmark of OSCC, supports membrane formation and lipid raft assembly. Acetyl-CoA, derived from glucose or glutamine, is converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC) and then to palmitate by fatty acid synthase (FASN). FASN, activated by PI3K/AKT and SREBP1 signaling, is overexpressed in advanced OSCC, correlating with poor prognosis and chemoresistance [ 44 Figure 2 45 46 47 48 Importantly, lipid metabolism dysregulation is also implicated in the progression from OLP to OSCC, underscoring the relevance of these pathways for early intervention and prevention. Collectively, these findings underscore lipid metabolism and biogenesis as critical targets for inhibiting OSCC growth and overcoming therapeutic resistance. 2.3. Glycolysis and the Warburg Effect OSCC exhibits metabolic reprogramming characterized by increased lactate production and the Warburg effect—a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, even in the presence of ample oxygen [ 49 50 51 p 52 OSCC’s reliance on glycolysis is further evidenced by the overexpression of key glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase II (HK-II), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate—a crucial regulatory step in glycolysis. HK-II is upregulated in cancer cells and can be selectively inhibited by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a glucose analog that, once phosphorylated, accumulates as 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate and inhibits HK-II activity. This leads to reduced intracellular glucose, ATP depletion, and ultimately, cancer cell death [ 53 54 55 56 In addition to glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters (GLUTs), particularly GLUT-1 and GLUT-3, are overexpressed in OSCC, facilitating increased glucose uptake. Inhibiting these transporters, either pharmacologically or genetically, induces apoptosis and suppresses tumor growth [ 57 58 59 2.4. Pentose Phosphate Pathway The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a critical metabolic node in OSCC, fueling tumor progression through NADPH production (maintaining redox balance) and ribose-5-phosphate synthesis (supporting nucleotide biosynthesis). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, is overexpressed in OSCC and correlates with advanced disease, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis [ 60 61 62 Preclinical studies highlight polydatin, a natural G6PD inhibitor, as a therapeutic candidate. Polydatin suppresses metastasis by restoring E-cadherin expression, reversing epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and reducing OSCC cell migration/invasion by 60–70% [ 63 63 60 2.5. Others Salivary Biomarkers: Insights and Applications Salivary metabolomics has emerged as a transformative approach for OSCC detection, offering non-invasive advantages over traditional tissue biopsies. Notably, elevated concentrations of metabolites such as glutamate, histidine, sialic acid and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), malic acid, maltose, methionine, inosine hypoxanthine, guanine, guanosine, spermidine, and pipercolate have been consistently detected in the saliva of OSCC patients [ 37 64 65 66 67 36 38 39 28 68 38 69 28 3. Immunological Biomarkers Associated with OSCC The immune system plays a pivotal role in detecting and eliminating abnormal cancerous cells [ 70 71 72 73 Predictive biomarkers can further refine cancer treatment by classifying patients according to their likely response to therapies including chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, radiation, targeted approaches, and immunotherapy. They also help identify individuals at risk for significant toxicity, informing dose adjustments or alternative treatments [ 74 Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized cancer care [ 75 3.1. Key Immune Biomarkers Identified in OSCC 3.1.1. Cytokines Cytokines, small proteins produced by immune and stromal cells, regulate cell growth, survival, migration, and mediate many functions. Elevated levels of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α contribute to tumor progression and invasion by promoting cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and vascularization, while also enhancing the tumor’s ability to evade immune detection [ 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 78 83 84 85 86 3.1.2. Chemokines Chemokines are signaling peptides that recruit inflammatory cells and play dual roles in tumor growth and angiogenesis during inflammation [ 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 3.1.3. Tumor Microenvironment (TME) Components The TME is a complex milieu of cancer, stromal, and immune cells, along with signaling molecules. It supports tumor growth and immune evasion, making it a critical focus for understanding OSCC progression and resistance [ 96 Table 2 Figure 3 The extracellular matrix (ECM) within the TME undergoes remodeling, driven by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which regulate cytokine levels and mediate cell migration during inflammation and metastasis [ 97 98 99 3.1.4. Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells The TME of OSCC is shaped by diverse immune cell populations that influence tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes. TILs, including CD3 + + + 100 101 CD4 + 102 103 104 105 CD8 + 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 MDSC, characterized by markers CD11b and CD33, further dampen anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting T cell activation and promoting EMT. Elevated MDSC infiltration correlates with malignant progression and poor prognosis. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit phenotypic plasticity within the TME [ 113 TAMs exhibit phenotypic plasticity within the TME. Initially, bone marrow-derived monocytes adopt an M1 phenotype, secreting IL-6, IL-12, and TNF to enhance CD8 + 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 In addition to immune cell composition, the physical and chemical conditions of the TME—particularly hypoxia—further modulate tumor behavior and immune responses in OSCC. biology-14-01109-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Lists key TME cell markers and their prognostic roles. Cell Type Markers Role Clinical Significance Reference CD8 + CD8 Anti-tumor Good prognosis Mittrücker et al., 2014 [ 106 Tregs FOXP3, CD25 Immunosuppression Poor prognosis Chaudhary & Elkord, 2016 [ 105 M2 TAMs CD163, CD206 Tumor promotion Poor prognosis Chaudhari et al., 2020 [ 121 CAFs αSMA, FAP ECM remodeling, immunosuppression Poor prognosis Dourado et al., 2018 [ 111 MDSCs CD11b, CD33 Immune suppression Disease progression Pang et al., 2020 [ 113 3.1.5. Hypoxia and Inflammation Mediators as Biomarkers Hypoxia and inflammation are pivotal features of the TME tumor microenvironment in OSCC, profoundly influencing disease progression and biomarker development. Hypoxic conditions within the tumor, mediated by HIFs, especially HIF-1α, drive the expression of genes involved in metabolism, angiogenesis, ECM remodeling, and immune modulation, and are strongly associated with poor survival, lymph node metastasis, and adverse prognosis in OSCC patients [ 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 97 129 130 131 132 133 4. Altered Immunological Biomarkers as Therapeutic Target Traditional treatments for OSCC—including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy—are effective for early-stage disease but are often limited by invasiveness, resistance, and adverse effects. The advent of immunotherapy has transformed the therapeutic landscape by harnessing the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Strategies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell therapy (ACT), antibody-based treatments, cytokine therapy, tumor vaccines, and gene therapy aim to stimulate or modulate anti-tumor immunity and enhance immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment [ 134 135 4.1. Immune Check Points Inhibitors Immune checkpoints (ICs) are regulatory molecules that maintain immune activation and self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and protecting host tissues from immune–mediated damage [ 136 135 Figure 4 CTLA-4 is a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on T cells and Tregs, where it plays a crucial role in inhibiting costimulatory signals and dampens T cell responses [ 137 138 138 139 140 141 142 143 The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is another critical target. PD-1 is expressed on activated T cells, interacts with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, and is often upregulated in tumors, including OSCC [ 144 144 145 146 147 Several promising immunotherapy clinical trials are currently underway to advance treatment for OSCC and related head and neck cancers. The TACTI-003 trial ( NCT04811027 NCT03839524 NCT04432597 NCT04140526 NCT03589339 Table 3 Despite these advances, a considerable proportion of patients exhibit either primary or acquired resistance to immunotherapy. Mechanisms underlying resistance are multifactorial and include both tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic factors [ 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 Beyond checkpoint inhibition, adoptive cellular immunotherapy offers another innovative strategy, harnessing and enhancing the patient’s own immune cells to target OSCC. 4.2. Adoptive Cellular Immunotherapy (ACI) ACI involves transferring immune cells with enhanced anti-tumor activity into patients [ 155 156 CAR-T cell therapy, in particular, has shown remarkable efficacy against hematological malignancies by targeting specific tumor antigens [ 157 158 Figure 4 159 160 To enhance the effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy in OSCC, further research should focus on developing CAR-T cells that target not only tumor-associated antigens (TAA) but also components of the TME that contribute to immunosuppression, such as macrophages, Tregs, CAFs, and IC molecules such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. Overcoming the immunosuppressive TME is essential to improving CAR-T cell efficacy and achieving a durable response in OSCC. In addition to advances in immunotherapy, recent research has highlighted the profound influence of metabolic pathways on immune cell function and tumor progression in OSCC. 5. The Role of Metabolism in Shaping Immune Responses The TME in OSCC is a dynamic metabolic landscape where both tumor and immune cells compete for essential nutrients, metabolites, and signaling molecules. Tumor cells often exploit key metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the TCA cycle, PPP, and lipid metabolism to sustain their rapid proliferation, suppress immune responses, and evade anti-tumor immunity [ 161 Table 4 For instance, tumor cells upregulate enzymes such as hexokinase 2 (HK2), which not only promotes glycolysis but also increases PD-L1 expression, thereby suppressing CD8 + 162 163 164 165 Importantly, the metabolic relationship between tumor and immune cells within the TME is bidirectional. Immune cells actively shape tumor metabolism through nutrient competition and cytokine signaling. For example, TAMs secrete cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, which upregulate glycolytic enzymes like HK2 and LDHA in tumor cells, amplifying lactate production and fostering a pro-tumorigenic environment [ 163 166 + 167 168 169 170 171 172 The TCA cycle is deeply involved in these metabolic dynamics. Fumaric acid accumulation in CD8 + 173 169 170 167 168 174 175 Tumor cells further manipulate tryptophan metabolism within the TME. Enzymes like indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) convert tryptophan into immunosuppressive kynurenine, which activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in CD4 + + 176 177 178 In addition to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism is pivotal in shaping the TME. Tumor cells often shift toward increased lipid utilization, particularly under glucose or oxygen shortages and cholesterol-rich membranes to evade immune destruction [ 168 + 171 179 Tregs also rely on lipid metabolism to maintain immune tolerance, and inhibiting their lipid synthesis pathways has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immunity [ 172 6. Comparative Insights with Other Head and Neck Cancers In contrast to other head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) subsites, OSCC, a common subtype, exhibits both overlapping and unique immunological and metabolic characteristics. Epidemiologically, OSCC and other head and neck cancers show distinct patterns in incidence and risk factors. OSCC remains one of the most common head and neck malignancies globally (approximately 380,000 new cases annually), exceeding the incidence of oropharyngeal (~98,000 cases), nasopharyngeal (~133,000), and laryngeal (~185,000) cancers [ 180 181 182 183 183 184 185 Immunologically, OSCC is distinguished by a suppressive TME that is abundant in MDSCs, CD163 + 186 + + 187 Although OSCC and other head and neck squamous malignancies have some common metabolic changes, including elevated fatty acid production, altered amino acid metabolism, and increased glycolysis [ 188 39 34 Therefore, unique metabolic reprogramming and an even more restrictive immunological milieu emphasizes its usefulness for targeted therapy and precision diagnosis in OSCC. 7. Challenges and Limitation for Biomarkers Research Research on biomarkers for OSCC faces numerous challenges spanning biological, technical and translational domains. One persistent obstacle is the significant molecular and clinical overlap between OSCC and other oral pathologies, such as Leukoplakia and Oral Lichen Planus. These non-malignant conditions often exhibit similar changes in gene expression, cytokine profiles, and epigenetic modifications, making it difficult to distinguish between benign, pre-malignant, and malignant lesions based solely on biomarker data. For example, inflammatory mediators like IL-6 and IL-8, as well as methylation changes in genes such as SHOX2 and SEPT9, are not exclusive to OSCC and can also be elevated in chronic inflammatory states, reducing the specificity of these markers for cancer detection [ 76 189 190 191 192 The dynamic nature of tumor evolution, including the emergence of resistant clones during therapy, further complicates the identification of stable and reliable biomarkers. Technical and methodological issues also present significant hurdles. The lack of standardized protocols for sample collection, processing, and analysis often leads to inconsistent findings across studies. Differences in the use of biological matrices (e.g., saliva, plasma, tissue biopsies), isolation techniques (such as those for circulating tumor cells or exosomes), and detection platforms (ranging from ELISA to next-generation sequencing) can all impact the reproducibility and comparability of results. Furthermore, the increasing use of high-throughput, multi-omics technologies generates vast and complex datasets that require sophisticated bioinformatics tools for integration and interpretation. However, many studies are limited by small sample sizes and lack validation in independent or diverse cohorts, increasing the risk of overfitting, publication bias, and false-positive discoveries [ 68 Translating biomarker discoveries into clinical practice is further impeded by regulatory, logistical, and economic barriers. Many candidate biomarkers, including promising long non-coding RNAs and protein panels, have yet to undergo rigorous multicenter validation or demonstrate clear clinical benefit in prospective trials. The absence of harmonized guidelines for biomarker qualification and the high costs associated with advanced molecular assays also limit their adoption in routine clinical workflows. To overcome these formidable challenges, future research must embrace multi-dimensional and collaborative strategies. The development of integrated biomarker panels that combine genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data holds promise for capturing the full complexity of OSCC and improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. Advances in liquid biopsy technologies, including standardized protocols for ctDNA and exosome analysis, may enhance the sensitivity and reproducibility of non-invasive tests [ 145 193 194 195 196 As the field continues to evolve, integrating multi-omics technologies and AI holds great promise for overcoming current limitations and advancing precision oncology in OSCC. 8. Future Directions: Emerging Technologies in OSCC Biomarker Research The integration of AI-driven biomarker discovery and spatial transcriptomics is revolutionizing OSCC research by addressing tumor heterogeneity and improving biomarker specificity [ 197 198 199 197 200 198 Future efforts should prioritize validating these tools in diverse patient cohorts, standardizing AI-driven biomarker panels, and leveraging spatial-omics to design therapies targeting critical TME niches. For instance, AI models predicting spatial heterogeneity in breast cancer could be adapted to OSCC to stratify high-risk patients [ 200 197 198 9. Conclusions In the rapidly evolving field of cancer therapeutics, biomarkers have become pivotal tools driving the transition towards precision oncology in OSCC. The integration of immune-profiling and metabolic biomarkers with cancer therapies has enhanced treatment outcomes by enabling more accurate patient selection and the development of tailored therapeutic strategies. Predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden are increasingly used to optimize immunotherapy efficacy, while altered metabolic profiles within tumors offer new avenues for targeted interventions. Despite significant progress, important gaps remain in our understanding of the TME, particularly regarding the metabolic reprogramming of specific cell populations. This calls for the need to focus on multi-omics approaches and spatial transcriptomics to unravel tumor heterogeneity and the complexity of the TME. Future research must prioritize standardization of multi-marker signatures that combine genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic biomarkers in saliva- and blood-based assays for clinical utility.

The workflow begins with the exploratory research phase, where saliva samples are collected and analyzed using advanced analytical techniques such as GC-MS, HPLC, and mass spectrophotometry. Identified candidate biomarkers undergo comprehensive characterization through multi-omics approaches, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, with AI-driven data mining used to prioritize promising markers. In the preclinical studies phase, biomarkers are validated first in vitro using cell culture and laboratory assays, followed by in vivo validation in animal models. The final phase involves clinical trials and regulatory approval, where biomarkers are evaluated in human cohorts for their diagnostic or prognostic utility before potential implementation in clinical practice. [Abbreviations: GC-MS, gas chromatography mass spectrometry; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography]. Figure 2 Overview of altered metabolic pathways in OSCC and their therapeutic targeting. The figure illustrates key metabolic processes supporting OSCC cell growth and survival, including glycolysis, PPP, the TCA cycle, and de novo lipogenesis. Glucose uptake via GLUT1 fuels glycolysis, with HK-II catalyzing the first step; inhibition by 2-deoxyglucose disrupts this pathway. The PPP, regulated by G6PD, generates ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide biosynthesis and is targeted by polydatin. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR/SREBP1 signaling axis promotes de novo lipogenesis through upregulation of ACC and FASN, FASN can be inhibited by an agent such as orlistat, thereby reducing fatty acid synthesis, proliferation, and metastasis. Glutamine metabolism, mediated by ASCT2 and glutaminases (GLS1/GLS2), feeds into the TCA cycle to support energy production and biosynthesis. Pharmacological inhibition at these metabolic nodes is highlighted as a strategy to suppress tumor growth and metastatic progression in OSCC. [Abbreviations: HK-II, hexokinase; 2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose; GLUTs, glucose transporters; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; aKG, alpha ketoglutarate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; α-KGDH, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FASN, fatty acid synthase; GLS1, glutaminase 1 and GLS2, glutaminase 2]. Figure 3 Tumor microenvironment-associated biomarkers. The intricate interplay between immune cells and the tumor microenvironment leads to the expression of various immunological biomarkers. These immune cells can be targeted for immunotherapy and can serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. In OSCC, specific immune cell biomarkers, such as CD11c, CD80, HLA-DR, CD163, CD11b, CD206, and others, are used for diagnosis. Additionally, markers like CD57, CD3, CD8, and CD19 + Figure 4 Innovative immunotherapeutic approaches for OSCC. The TME induces the expression of ICM, including PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, which hamper T cell activation and effector functions. These ICM can be blocked using monoclonal antibodies to prevent their ligation with the corresponding ligands, such as CD80/86 and PD-1. Inhibiting ICM enhances anti-tumor immunity ( A B biology-14-01109-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Metabolic Reprogramming in OSCC: Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets.
