Introduction Clostridium difficile 1 Clostridium difficile Clostridium difficile 2 Numerous studies have demonstrated that cancer patients with CDI experience significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality [ 3 4 5 6 Clostridium difficile 7 A specific clinical dilemma arises when oncological patients, particularly those undergoing abdominopelvic surgeries, are found to be colonized with Clostridium difficile C. Difficile C. difficile 8 9 10 C. difficile 11 C. difficile 12 13 7 14 15 C. difficile To date, no study has specifically evaluated morbidity and mortality in this subgroup. This study aims to address the gap by examining postoperative complications and morbidity in oncology patients undergoing abdominopelvic surgery who are colonized with C. difficile, 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Design and Setting This is a single-center, single-department, observational, retrospective comparative study conducted on oncological surgical patients diagnosed with C. difficile All patients were screened for C. difficile ® 7 C. difficile For the purposes of our study, C. difficile C. difficile Patients that tested positive for C. difficile C. difficile Clostridium difficile C. difficile This study received ethical approval from our institutional ethics committee (registration number: 271/26 May 2025). Informed consent was waived as the research involved anonymized data and posed no risk to patients. 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria This study adhered to the STROBE checklist ( Figure 1 C. difficile 2.3. Data Analysis Clinical and surgical data were retrospectively extracted from electronic medical records. Clostridium difficile Collected variables included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, primary diagnosis, type of surgical procedure, length of hospital stay, antibiotic exposure, intraoperative complications, pre- and postoperative laboratory values, overall medical and surgical morbidity, and both in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Quantitative variables were analyzed using independent sample T p 16 17 Figure 2 Key: Absolute standardized mean differences (SMDs) for each covariate are shown pre-match (circles) and post-match (triangles). Dashed vertical lines mark |SMD| thresholds of 0.05 and 0.10; values <0.10 indicate adequate balance. Matching was 1:1 using Mahalanobis distance with 0.20 caliper, without replacement; SMDs used the pooled standard deviation. 3. Results 3.1. Cohort Characteristics Between 2018 and 2023, a total of 236 patients in our department tested positive for C. difficile ® C. difficile C. difficile 3.2. CDC Group Among the 90 CDC patients, 62 received antibiotic treatment and 28 did not. Surgical procedures were categorized into three main types: gastrointestinal, gynecological, and hepato-pancreato-biliary. The majority underwent gastrointestinal surgery (71.1%), followed by gynecological surgery (18.8%) and hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery (10.0%). A detailed distribution is shown in Table 1 Figure 3 3.3. Preoperative Characteristics Table 2 Table 3 3.4. Postoperative Outcomes Postoperative outcomes before and after propensity score matching (PSM) are presented in Table 4 Table 5 p Clostridium difficile p p Table 6 Figure 4 p Figure 5 4. Discussion Clostridium difficile Our study sought to evaluate whether antibiotic treatment in CDC patients undergoing abdominopelvic oncologic surgery confers any protective effect in terms of postoperative outcomes. We showed that CDC patients who received prophylactic antibiotic treatments had similar outcomes compared to those who did not receive antibiotics. A non-significant trend ( p p p p p 18 19 20 21 p Notably, none of our patients, regardless of antibiotic exposure, experienced Clostridium difficile 22 13 23 24 25 26 27 Despite existing evidence and guidelines endorsing our findings that antibiotic prophylaxis in CDC is not required, the protocols refer to the general population including mostly low-risk immunocompetent patients. This has led practitioners to question whether in subgroups, such as immunosuppressed surgical oncological patients, low-dose Vancomycin could be used to reduce the risk of postoperative morbidity and CD exacerbation considering their intrinsic higher risk. Our results demonstrated no significant differences in postoperative outcomes between patients who received prophylactic antibiotics and those who did not, highlighting the importance of deferring prophylactic antibiotic use even in high-risk cancer patients colonized with CD. It is important to recognize that asymptomatic C. difficile 28 29 30 When CDI does occur in the perioperative period, the consequences for oncologic patients can be substantial. Episodes of CDI frequently prolong hospitalization by days to weeks [ 7 In colorectal surgery, the impact of CDI is particularly concerning because of its potential to compromise anastomotic healing. The inflammatory response triggered by CDI can undermine anastomotic integrity. In one of our previous studies, the anastomotic leak rate among patients with postoperative CDI reached 22%, a 7.44-fold increase compared to controls (OR 7.44, 95% CI) [ 14 The timing of postoperative adjuvant therapy is critical for cancer prognosis. For many malignancies, including colorectal and ovarian cancer, initiating chemotherapy within 6–8 weeks after surgery is associated with optimal survival outcomes. However, patients who develop severe CDI may spend weeks in hospital recovering, potentially missing this therapeutic window. In a recent Korean study, ovarian cancer patients who developed CDI during chemotherapy experienced significant treatment interruptions, and some were unable to return to their baseline performance status, jeopardizing disease control [ 14 A recent and noteworthy contribution supporting prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic C. difficile 15 C. difficile Our hospital conducts routine screening for Clostridium difficile 31 32 Clostridium difficile 33 As noted, our study included a relatively small cohort of 90 patients. A more comprehensive investigation could be conducted if multiple hospitals tested patients for Clostridium difficile This study has its limitations. The retrospective nature of this study implies a higher risk of selection bias, although we did try to reduce its impact on the results by performing PSM in a one-to-one fashion, extracting comparable patients from the control group. The heterogeneity of the study group was low even before PSM, proven by the overall similar results between the initial groups and matched ones. Still, even with PSM, one cannot account for missing variables (i.e., nutritional status, intraoperative variables) which may represent additional confounding. Another limitation is the relatively small number of patients in the study groups which restricts the ability to detect smaller effect sizes and may explain non-significant trends. However, considering the relative low incidence of CDC in clinical practice, it is difficult to gather a larger cohort without multicenter collaboration. Another point of view is the variation in protocols among institutions. Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and infection control protocol vary and this reduces the external validity of our results. We should also consider that CD carriers are not homogenous groups as far as we can easily imagine different levels of colonization in the same category. There is also a limitation in the detection method and detection limit of the method in a rapid immunoassay test, as the rapid test (CerTest Biotec ® 5.
