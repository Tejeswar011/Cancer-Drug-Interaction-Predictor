Introduction ONC201 (also known as dordaviprone/TIC10/Modeyso TM 1 2 3 4 5 Its promising pharmacokinetic properties, shorter half-life, and selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells make ONC201 suitable for combination therapies [ 3 6 7 8 9 2. Mechanism of Action of ONC201 as a Single Agent in Different Cancers From several preclinical studies, it has been well established that ONC201 exhibits anti-tumorigenic properties as a single agent. The chemical structure and general mechanism of action of ONC201 across cancers are depicted in Figure 1 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 11 16 17 12 16 3 18 19 20 In early preclinical studies, ONC201 demonstrated single-agent efficacy in eliminating cancer stem cells in colorectal, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer models [ 21 22 23 14 24 25 26 27 20 28 29 30 3. Combination Strategies Using ONC201 and/or Its Analogs Against Various Cancers Combination therapy is a treatment strategy that combines two or more therapeutic agents and is often superior to monotherapy for cancers. It aims to combine agents with different mechanisms of action and minimal cross-resistance in order to inhibit the emergence of broad-spectrum drug resistance [ 31 32 33 34 3.1. Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) has an adverse prognosis with a high mortality rate [ 35 36 37 ONC201 was found to be an intriguing targeted drug for CRC cells, especially for those that are resistant to standard therapy [ 4 3 1 38 39 ONC201 and Raw Lacquer Extract (RLE) from a deciduous tree ( Toxicodendron vernicifluum 40 T. vernicifluum 41 42 3.2. Pancreatic Cancer Pancreatic cancer is a highly chemoresistant malignancy with low survival rates [ 43 44 It is treated using surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. While surgery is the only option for localized pancreatic cancer, gemcitabine-based regimens are the primary first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer [ 45 46 47 48 The combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, PARP inhibitors, or immune checkpoint inhibitors is an example of effective targeted medicine [ 49 50 ONC201 curbs the growth of and induces an apoptotic response in multiple pancreatic cancer cell lines. However, when ONC201 was subjected to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines, it showed a higher anti-proliferative response than an apoptotic response [ 27 51 52 Over 90% of pancreatic cancers harbor a KRAS mutation, which leads to the activation of PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK signaling pathways and, therefore, drug resistance. However, targeting both pathways with two specific inhibitors would lead to severe toxicity. Gemcitabine—the main drug approved for pancreatic cancer—is metabolically unstable and hence needs to be stabilized by a prodrug approach [ 53 54 Lurbinectedin is a synthetic tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid used in chemotherapy. Lurbinectedin binds to guanine-rich regions in the minor groove of DNA to block active transcription. As a single agent, lurbinectedin effectively kills pancreatic tumor cells and also exhibits synergism with ONC201 as well as ONC212 [ 55 3.3. Glioblastoma Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal disease with a poor clinical prognosis. Glioblastomas are treatment-resistant, and, hence, there is a need for novel therapies [ 56 57 58 59 60 GBM metabolizes glucose for the production of energy. However, upon glucose deprivation, the tumor cells start utilizing fructose, amino acids, and fatty acids so that they can rapidly proliferate [ 61 62 21 63 Two-deoxyglucose is an analog of glucose. When hexokinase phosphorylates this analog, 2-deoxyglucose phosphate is formed. This molecule cannot undergo further reactions, thus inhibiting glycolysis. The combination of ONC201 and 2-deoxyglucose has been tested for therapeutic potential in the U251 and A172 GBM cell lines. Metabolic reprogramming using 2-deoxyglucose along with ONC201 leads to the depletion of energy and enhanced anticancer activity [ 64 18 ONC201 and its analog ONC206 have also been tested for activity in diffused midline glioma (DMG) models with a H3K27M mutation. Both of these drugs show potent antitumor activity in vitro as well as in DMG-patient-derived xenograft mice models [ 5 65 66 3.4. Lung Cancer India has the fourth-highest prevalence of lung cancer in the world, with the fastest increase in rates occurring in urban areas [ 67 68 Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an advanced neuroendocrine carcinoma that contributes to around 15% of all lung cancers, primarily in smokers, and is linked to a very poor prognosis. It is an inflammatory disease with minimal treatment choices. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are initially effective, but, eventually, treatment resistance often develops [ 69 70 The potency of the combination of ONC201 and lurbinectedin was examined in H1048 SCLC cells. H1048 SCLC cells co-treated with these drugs exhibited increased ATF4 and cleaved PARP and ClpP, indicating higher apoptosis. Lurbinectedin is used as a second-line therapy for recurrent or progressive diseases and is reported to have lower toxicity among patients. This molecule inhibits RNA polymerase II, a commonly hyperactive enzyme in SCLC known to promote tumor cell proliferation. Additionally, lurbinectedin causes apoptosis by attaching to a central guanine in trinucleotide triplets in the minor groove of DNA. Tumor cells experience acute DNA damage, which leads to increased production of proteins such as cleaved PARP, ATF4, phosphorylated Chk1, and γ-H2AX. Lurbinectedin is in FDA-approved clinical trials for SCLC and is being studied for potential synergy with other agents in various cancer cell lines [ 71 ONC201 was proven to have a synergistic impact on patients with SCLC when combined with the traditional first-line chemotherapeutic drugs carboplatin and etoposide. ONC201, etoposide, and carboplatin were administered as a novel triple-drug combination to SCLC cell lines H1048 and H1105. This combination treatment enhanced the expression of ATF4 and cleaved PARP. The use of ONC201 in conjunction with etoposide and carboplatin offers a possible innovative triple-drug combination strategy for small-cell lung cancer [ 72 Recently, a study showed that the combination of lurbinectedin with ONC201 revealed synergism in patient-derived SCLC cells in vitro, without any toxicity to normal lung epithelium [ 73 More than 80% of all lung cancers are non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) [ 74 75 76 77 ONC201 exhibits cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects on both established and primary NSCLC cells derived from patients while being non-toxic to normal lung epithelial cells. It triggers apoptosis in NSCLC cells by inducing TRAIL/DR5-dependent caspase-8 activation [ 78 3 3.5. Endometrial Cancer India has a comparatively low prevalence of endometrial cancer when compared with Western nations. However, due to lifestyle variables and socioeconomic shifts, its prevalence is increasing [ 79 80 81 82 Research has demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors greatly improve progression-free survival when added to chemotherapy. The greatest advantages are seen in patients with certain genetic markers, like microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) [ 83 84 In endometrial cancer models, ONC201 alone has demonstrated anti-tumorigenic effects, triggering the integrated stress response and causing cell death or growth arrest, suggesting its potential as a standalone treatment or in combination with other therapies for endometrial cancer [ 85 28 Furthermore, in endometrial cancer cell lines and mouse models, the combination of ONC206 and the PARP inhibitor olaparib was shown to exert synergistic anti-proliferative effects and enhanced apoptosis, indicating another possible therapeutic strategy for this cancer [ 86 The mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) homolog has become a target of increasing interest as a frequently amplified marker of tumor aggressiveness across several cancers. MDM2 is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets p53. Milademetan (RAIN-32) is an inhibitor of the MDM2–p53 complex, which stabilizes p53 [ 87 88 3.6. Ovarian Cancer In India, ovarian cancer is the third most frequent gynecological cancer in women, making it a serious health problem. Poor survival rates and a high incidence of late-stage diagnosis characterize the prevalence of ovarian cancer in India [ 89 90 With a variety of clinical traits, histological subtypes, and treatment obstacles, ovarian cancer is a difficult and aggressive illness [ 81 91 92 93 94 79 95 ONC201 showed synergism with the standard therapeutic drug paclitaxel in high-grade and low-grade ovarian cancer cell lines, irrespective of their platinum sensitivity [ 96 97 98 99 3.7. Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is common in India, with an incidence rate of about 20–30% [ 100 101 102 For the majority of TNBC cases, preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which may include targeted medications, has become the accepted course of treatment [ 103 104 105 106 According to research, ONC201 causes TRAIL expression, which can impact both TNBC and non-TNBC cells and, in certain situations, result in cell death [ 107 108 109 Studies show that everolimus plus ONC201/TIC10 is effective in therapy-resistant ER+ breast cancer cells [ 110 20 A study demonstrated the synergistic action of a combination of rucaparib (a PARP inhibitor) and imipridone (ONC212/ONC201) in BRCA1/2-deficient breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer cell lines [ 111 112 3.8. Prostate Cancer According to several reports, the incidence of prostate cancer has been increasing alarmingly in India [ 113 114 115 116 117 ONC201 is seen as an efficacious treatment for prostate cancer in preclinical studies. ONC201 showed a clinical benefit in prostate cancer patients during early clinical trials [ 22 25 Many studies have explored the potential of ONC201 in LNCaP prostate cancer xenograft models as single agent. The combination of ONC201, darolutamide, and enzalutamide worked synergistically to reduce cellular viability, induce apoptosis, and downregulate AR signaling in a castration-resistant prostate cancer model [ 118 119 In castration-resistant prostate cancer, ONC201/TIC10 in combination with enzalutamide and darolutamide exhibits promising antitumor activity by targeting androgen receptor signaling and integrated stress response pathways [ 118 120 As mentioned above, breast, ovarian, and prostate malignancies harbor BRCA1/2 mutations. Tumor cells with BRCA1/2 mutations are susceptible to PARP inhibitors (PARPis), which disrupt the DNA replication fork. Studies have postulated that imipridones, when combined with a PARPi (such as olaparib or rucaparib), would overcome PARPi resistance (which is mediated by hyperactivation of AKT). Additionally, PARPis make different solid tumors more sensitive to recombinant TRAIL and DR5 agonists/antibodies, as imipridones and PARPis work in concert. In BRCA-deficient cancer cells, the effectiveness of the imipridone ONC201 as a single agent and its synergy in combination with olaparib have been demonstrated. Thus, the combination of an imipridone (ONC212/ONC201) and rucaparib (a PARP inhibitor) in BRCA1/2-deficient breast and ovarian cancer cell lines offers therapeutic promise [ 111 121 3.9. Gastric Adenocarcinoma Gastric adenocarcinoma, which has two different histological subtypes (diffuse and intestinal), is a serious global health concern. Localized disease is treated with amputation, whereas advanced stages require chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [ 122 123 124 125 In order to determine the exact mechanism of action of ONC201, researchers have looked into its capacity to cause cell death in gastric adenocarcinoma cells when combined with recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) as well as its impact on the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) and DR5. Dual therapy with ONC201 and rhTRAIL resulted in substantial synergy across all cell lines, with combination indices < 0.6 at doses that did not cause cell death in normal fibroblasts. After administering ONC201 and rhTRAIL in combination, the results proved that apoptosis was due to enhanced fragmentation of PARP, caspase-8, and caspase-3 as compared with rhTRAIL alone. ONC201 led to downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, viz. cIAP-2 and XIAP, and upregulation of ATF4 and CHOP, indicating activation of the integrated stress response pathway. ONC201 in combination with rhTRAIL also exhibited ISR activation, enhanced DR5 cell surface expression, and downregulation of apoptosis inhibitors [ 126 127 Table 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 4. Limitations of/Current Challenges with ONC201-Based Anticancer Therapy ONC201, as a dual AKT and ERK inhibitor, has shown promise in preclinical models and is now the first and only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of recurrent pediatric and adult H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (DMG). The safety features of ONC201/TIC10 that were key selection criteria offer a range of clinical opportunities where genotoxic and toxic therapies are intractable [ 133 134 130 Although caseinolytic protease (CIpP) has been identified as a direct binding target of ONC201, it seems to act independently of CIpP via different mechanisms in diverse types of cancers [ 17 26 135 136 65 137 138 131 139 119 In the past, there was a discrepancy between the reported structure of ONC201 (TIC10) (with a linear inactive core) and the active structure (with an angular active core), which was confirmed by extensive analysis using NMR and X-ray crystallography [ 135 5. ONC201 Analogs Based on the favorable pharmacological properties of ONC201, such as its safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and bioavailability, a structure–activity relationship (SAR) approach was used to enhance the anticancer efficacy of its novel, tri-heterocyclic scaffold. The SAR approach led to the identification of new imipridones that retain the core structure of ONC201 while exhibiting engagement with ONC201 targets, such as DRD2 and ClpP. ONC206 and ONC212 are fluorinated ONC201 derivatives with nanomolar potency. Like ONC201, their antitumor effect also involves hyperactivation of ClpP, initiating tumor-specific apoptosis. Thus, there is interest in further evaluation of imipridone analogs such as ONC206 and ONC212 in GBM and DIPG [ 140 NCT04541082 141 142 143 131 144 Furthermore, ONC206 has demonstrated anti-tumorigenic activity in endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer [ 145 146 147 86 148 149 150 151 152 153 ONC212 shows enhanced apoptotic-inducing potential when combined with phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PDGDH) inhibitors against GBM cells and reduced tumor size in GBM and colon carcinoma models [ 130 154 51 6. Future Perspectives ONC201 is an imipridone with proven efficacy in preclinical models of several cancers. It has shown clinical activity in tumor types that overexpress DRD2 and/or ClpP, such as certain types of high-grade glioma, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, and mantle cell lymphoma. Further, it shows synergism with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. It is the first FDA-approved systemic therapy for H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. Novel, more potent analogs of ONC201 have been developed based on SAR-based screens, viz. ONC206, ONC212, TBP-134, and PBP-135, which also exhibit potency and synergism with the standard therapies [ 155 156 157 158 159 160 7. Conclusions ONC201 is a first-in-class, orally efficacious small molecule of the imipridone family that specifically kills various types of cancer cells and is currently in clinical trials for different types of cancers. Combination therapy employs suboptimal doses of two or more drugs with non-overlapping targets and toxicities, thus maximizing the efficacy while overcoming resistance to monotherapy. In the past few years, various preclinical studies have established that ONC201 and its analogs, ONC206 and ONC212, exhibit synergism with standard-of-care chemotherapy drugs across different types of cancers. The synergy observed in preclinical studies, good therapeutic index, and lack of toxicity as a single agent make imipridones ideal candidates for combination therapy so as to overcome therapy resistance in various cancers. Such treatment regimens are worth exploring in the clinic for all types of cancers.
