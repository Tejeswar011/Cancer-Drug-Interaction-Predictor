Objective Google Trends provides data on searches made on Google from a specific region in a specific period. The aim of this study is to determine the focus of interest in otorhinolaryngology in Türkiye between 2004-2024 using this method. Methods Otorhinolaryngology was studied in five subbranches; namely, otology, rhinology, laryngology, head and neck surgery, and facial plastics. The 70 most searched terms in the last 20 years related to these subbranches were determined. The change in the search rates of the terms belonging to each subbranch and the change in the search percentages of the subbranches compared to the total number were determined and evaluated over the years. Results In all terms examined, significant increases were observed in general since 2004. However, decrease was observed in all terms, except a few, in 2020-2021, i.e., during the pandemic. In the comparison between subbranches, in the last few years, the lowest search rate was seen in laryngology with 16.86%, and the highest search rate was seen in otology with 24.06%. Conclusion Knowing the topics where interest is clustered can be used to guide future medical practices and scientific research.

Notably, approximately 5% of all Internet searches executed through Google, a leading global search engine, have been identified as pertaining to health-related content ( 1 Among these search engines, Google Trends (Google LCC, Alphabet Inc., Mountain View, California, USA), with its open data access, enables the tracking of changes in public interest in various keywords and topics over time. Infodemiological studies in the literature have examined the tendency of societies to obtain information about various diseases ( 2 3 4 Our study was designed to examine the perception of the otorhinolaryngology field by the society in our country between the years 2004 and 2024. In addition to determining the status of the interest in the subbranches of our field, this study also attempted to understand which topics tended to increase/decrease through the words examined. In light of the data obtained in this study, we otolaryngologists can draw more attention to topics where there is little interest in the society or prevent information pollution by providing correct guidance on topics where interest is concentrated. At the same time, the topics in which interest in the society has increased can be determined and be given more space when planning specialization or in-service training meetings. Methods The data obtained through Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/) is proportional, calculated by dividing the number of searches for a given term in a specific region by the total number of searches made in that region in a given month. Since the total search information will reach very high numbers, Google simplifies this data proportionally. With this data, Google Trends creates relative search volume (RSV). RSV is presented on a scale of 0-100 according to the ratio of a term to all other searches. In our study, the field of otorhinolaryngology was studied in five subbranches; namely, otology, rhinology, laryngology, head and neck surgery, and facial plastic surgery. For each subbranch, at least five terms from the subjects of anatomical structure, symptom, diagnosis, diagnostic examination, and treatment (an attempt was made to include the highest number of terms here without any limitation) were included and a total of 70 terms were used. These terms are shown in Table 1 As the data were obtained from the public domain and did not involve human participants, the study did not require local ethics approval or informed consent. The collection and evaluation of the data, followed by re-verification and processing, took approximately 12 days. Statistical Analysis In statistical analysis, firstly, Shapiro-Wilk analysis was performed to evaluate the normality of distribution of the search rates. The data was found to be distributed nonparametrically. The Friedman test was applied to study the change within each subbranch (p<0.05 was considered significant). Then, total search rates were calculated for each year. The percentage value of each subbranch was calculated from this total. The Wilcoxon signed-rank method was used to evaluate the changes within the subbranches over the years (p<0.05 value was considered as statistically significant). Statistical analyses were made using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The search rates of the terms were studied separately for each subbranch and term. The search rates and changes for rhinology terms are shown in Figure 1 Regarding otology, the terms “ear,” “ear infection,” “middle ear infection,” “vertigo,” and “hearing aid” were searched since 2004. In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic started, the search rates of the terms “ear itch,” “cerumen,” “balance test,” “vertigo” and “tinnitus” increased, while the others decreased. This decrease was most clearly observed in the terms “eardrum” and “eardrum surgery.” In 2024, the terms searched for at the highest rate were “cerumen,” “tinnitus,” and “cochlear implant,” respectively. The search rates and change graph of otology terms are given in Figure 2 Regarding the terms related to laryngology, “larynx” and “larynx cancer,” were searched since 2004. Even among the terms that we have identified as being the most searched for this subbranch, we can see that the years in which searches first began are later than in other subbranches and that the curve showing the rate of searches is flatter ( Figure 3 In the head and neck area, the most searched term in 2024 was “thyroid.” The most significant decrease in search rates in this subbranch in 2020 was observed in the terms “tonsillectomy,” “adenoidectomy,” and “throat culture.” It was also observed that the terms “oral wound,” “wound of the tongue,” and “neck pain” increased during this period. In this subbranch, the search started in 2010, and its rate increased, then decreased during the pandemic, but continued with a rapid increase in the following years. In 2024, “neck magnetic resonance imaging” comes forth as the second most searched term in this subbranch. The search rates of the terms and their changes over the years are given in Figure 4 While only the terms “nose aesthetics” and “rhinoplasty” were searched for facial plastic surgery in 2004-2005, interest in the terms “protruding ear” and “bags under eyes” increased in the following three years. All terms decreased or slightly increased during the pandemic period. The terms that showed the most significant decrease were “bags under eyes” and “facial aesthetics,” respectively. The terms with the highest interest after 2020 were “nasal tip,” “nose aesthetic,” “protruding ear,” and “wide nose.” The term “prominent ear surgery,” which had the highest search rate between 2011-2015, has decreased in recent years. The search rates of the term “otoplasty,” which is synonymous with this term, were low in total and were not included in our study. However, we can see in the search graph that the search rate of this term has increased in recent years ( Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 Finally, the total search rates of the subbranches were compared. The graph showing the changes in all years is given in Figure 8 Table 2 rd th nd nd rd st th nd rd th st nd st rd nd th st rd nd Discussion The Internet is increasingly being used in the society to obtain information about health-related issues. A 2010 study conducted in the United States of America, involving interviews with 3,001 adults, demonstrated that individuals perceived the Internet as a very valuable source of information for reasons such as obtaining quick information about health, evaluating other treatment options, or learning more about prescriptions ( 2 Health information seeking behavior can be useful in tracking people’s trends, disease epidemiology, etiology, and management of certain health conditions ( 3 4 However, after many problems were experienced because of information pollution, especially during the pandemic, the science of infodemiology, which examines the ways of obtaining information over the Internet and aims to provide accurate information presentation, emerged. Searches made on Internet search engines and social media are recorded in real time, enabling infodemiological research ( 5 Google Trends, which extracts data from a portion of approximately three billion daily searches, is an important data source for assessing public behavioral trends. In addition, Google Trends has been proven to be effective in many studies in the literature ( 6 7 8 Determining public interest using Internet search engines can be leveraged to shape preventive medicine activities by revealing the need for information on topics such as head and neck malignancies. For example, the search rate for the term “nasopharynx cancer” has been 221 in total since 2004. This rate is below the annual search rate for many other terms, as seen in the figures in our study. In addition, the increase in public interest in some scientifically unproven treatments can also be determined through Google Trends data. In this context, an orthopedic study reviewed the search rates for platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment for hip and knee osteoarthritis. The authors suggested that, in instances where public interest increases for treatments like PRP—whose efficacy remains unproven—academic governing bodies ought to initiate informational campaigns targeting both surgeons and the general public ( 9 Some studies using Google Trends to obtain information about otorhinolaryngology have been published in the literature in recent years. One study concluded that throat cancer screening rates could vary across the years and communities ( 3 10 4 11 12 13 In a publication similar to ours, the change in awareness and interest in chronic liver diseases between 2004-2017 years was examined. This publication reported that people avoided complex medical terms in their searches. It was also reported that current scientific data did not rapidly affect the searches ( 14 In our study, we found changes in the search rates of Google Trends search terms during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparable situation was observed for the terms related to other branches. For example, one study reported that the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome decreased in the field of emergency, but the search rate for the term chest pain, which is known to be highly searched for with this diagnosis, increased. This was associated with patients’ search for information on the Internet because of their tendency to avoid emergency room visits ( 15 A study in literature has shown that although the search rate for terms related to aesthetics and cosmetic procedures decreased in the months when the COVID-19 pandemic began, it increased significantly in the following months ( 16 Another recently published study found that all surgical procedures examined (including non-aesthetic procedures such as cataract surgery) decreased at the beginning of the pandemic. However, a statistically significant increase was observed later in the terms blepharoplasty, facelift, neck lift, and Botox compared to the pre-pandemic period. This study reported that interest in the term “rhinoplasty” initially increased and then returned to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022 ( 17 Figures 5 6 Since no similar studies were found in the literature, we have no way of comparing the search rates of otorhinolaryngology-related terms from Türkiye with searches from other countries. However, our study provides important information about the perception of otorhinolaryngology by the public in Türkiye. The limitations of our study are that data was obtained from a single search engine, and there is no data that could allow for analyzing detailed search behavior (such as demographic data, search location, and possible interactions with media or social media that were not scanned back), and terms may have meanings other than their medical meanings. The reason why Google was chosen as the search engine in our study is that Google offers the most preferred search engine in the world, with more than 89% of the market share ( 18 Conclusion The change in the terms searched for regarding subbranches of otorhinolaryngology on Internet search engines is important in terms of reflecting the interests of society today. Keeping this data up to date will make it possible to shape preventive medicine practices, identify disease clusters and apply them to future clinical research. Main Points • In our country, Internet searches for terms related to all topics of ear, nose and throat have increased significantly between 2004 and 2023 compared to the previous year. • The sub-branch with the highest interest was head and neck surgery. • The sub-branch with the lowest interest was laryngology. • In our country, during the coronavirus disease pandemic in 2020-2021, it was determined that interest in rhinology and facial plastics continued to increase, but interest in other topics decreased.
