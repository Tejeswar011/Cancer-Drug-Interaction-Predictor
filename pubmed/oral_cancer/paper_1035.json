Introduction Lysine (2,6-diaminohexanoic acid, symbols Lys or K) is a basic, proteinogenic, ketogenic, and nutritionally essential amino acid.  More than 60 years ago, it was proven that lysine is the first limiting amino acid in cereals, and using the nitrogen balance technique, it was shown in children that the addition of lysine to a basal wheat diet markedly increases nitrogen retention [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This article aims to provide an overview of lysine’s physiological importance and its possible use as a dietary supplement and in therapy. We hope that a combination of scientific, clinical, and nutritional information will be of interest to clinicians and researchers in the fields of nutrition and amino acid and protein metabolism. 2. Sources and Requirements Lysine is abundantly present in foods of animal origin. Plant sources with a high lysine content include legumes, nuts, and dry fruit. The small lysine content limits the nutritional value of cereals, rice, and corn [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 The required daily supply of lysine for adults is ~30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg for children, and up to 130 mg/kg for infants [ 14 15 16 17 3. Lysine Transporters Cationic amino acid transporters, referred to as y + 18 19 20 21 Na + + 22 23 + 0,+ + + Figure 1 3.1. Lysinuric Protein Intolerance Lysinuric protein intolerance is the main hereditary disorder of lysine transport through the plasma membrane, characterized by impaired absorption of arginine, lysine, and ornithine (“ALO group”) in the small intestine and proximal tubules in the kidneys due to SLC7A7 (y + 24 3.2. Lysine–Arginine Antagonism Because lysine transporters through the plasma membrane also have an affinity for arginine (most ornithine in the body is synthesized from arginine and glutamate by arginase and ornithine aminotransferase, respectively), these amino acids compete with each other to bind to the carrier. Therefore, an excessive supply of one amino acid can lead to a deterioration in the transport and metabolism of both and affect the production of various compounds such as NO, ornithine, creatine, and polyamines. For instance, an arginine-enriched diet increased postprandial concentrations of arginine and ornithine (due to its formation from arginine by arginase) and decreased lysine in plasma in rats [ 20 25 Section 7 4. Lysine Catabolism The major site of lysine catabolism in humans is the mitochondria in the liver; the muscle, kidneys, heart, brain, and intestinal epithelial cells have less significant capacity [ 26 Figure 2 . 4.1. The Saccharopine Pathway The saccharopine pathway has been described in detail in several articles [ 13 27 Blemmings et al. [ 28 + 29 4.2. The Pipecolate Pathway Lysine catabolism via the pipecolic acid pathway, which converges with the saccharopine pathway at the point of AASA, is active in the mammalian brain [ 30 27 The first step, the formation of 2-oxo-6-aminocaproate, which is spontaneously converted to piperideine-2-carboxylate (P2C), results from lysine transamination or deamination. The enzyme ketimine reductase, called µ-crystallin, encoded by the CRYM gene in humans, converts P2C to pipecolic acid. Pipecolate is further converted by pipecolic acid oxidase into piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C), which can be spontaneously converted to AASA and enter the saccharopine pathway. Because P6C is in equilibrium with AASA and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase can convert P6C back to pipecolic acid, there is a possibility of reversible conversion of AASA and pipecolate [ 27 31 In the spotlight of neurochemists is ketimine reductase (µ-crystallin), which acts as a thyroid hormone-binding protein. The binding of T3 strongly inhibits the enzyme and the flux of lysine through the pipecolic acid pathway. The regulation of µ-crystallin by thyroid hormones probably has an important role in neuronal development and function [ 32 33 4.3. Disorders of Lysine Catabolism The disorders of lysine catabolism requiring early implementation of lysine-restricted diets are glutaric aciduria type 1 and pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Hyperlysinemia, saccharopinuria, and 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria are generally considered benign disorders [ 27 34 Glutaric aciduria type 1 35 Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (antiquitin deficiency) 6 36 37 38 Hyperlysinemia Saccharopinuria 39 40 Caenorhabditis elegans 41 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria 27 5. Physiological Importance Lysine is a proteinogenic amino acid that acts as a substrate for post-translational modifications and the synthesis of several physiologically important substances ( Figure 3 5.1. Lysine in Proteins The content of L-lysine in most proteins is 6–8%. High amounts (even over 20%) are found along with arginine in histones, basic proteins in the cell nucleus [ 42 43 44 5 6 Section 6.9 5.2. Post-Translational Modifications Post-translational modification (PTM) is one of the body’s major mechanisms to increase the number of protein species and the diversity of their functions. So-called writers, erasers, and readers mediate the control of PTM and its impact on metabolism. Writers ensure additions of various chemical groups to the target, e.g., methylation of the ε-amino group of lysine residue by specific methyltransferase. Some PTMs, such as glycation, occur spontaneously. Readers include specialized domains of some proteins that recognize those modifications and initiate a specific metabolic response. Erasers are enzymes that are efficient in removing these chemical tags. Dysregulation of PTM is associated with several diseases, including carcinogenesis, diabetes, and neuropsychiatric disorders [ 45 46 47 48 The common modifications of lysine residues include the formation of desmosine and isodesmosine in elastin, hydroxylation in collagen, covalent bonds with glutamine side chains, ubiquitination, sumoylation, neddylation, lactylation, methylation, acylation (particularly acetylation), carbamylation, and glycation. 5.2.1. Desmosine and Isodesmosine Formation in Elastin Elastin is an extracellular matrix protein organized into elastic fibers that provide elasticity, e.g., of the skin, lungs, aorta, ligaments, and urinary bladder. The soluble precursor of elastin is tropoelastin, secreted by elastogenic cells such as fibroblasts, lung alveolar cells, smooth muscle cells, and chondrocytes, which aggregates via a process known as coacervation [ 49 Figure 4 50 When elastin breaks down, desmosine and isodesmosine are released into the blood and excreted in the urine. Urinary desmosine excretion is a biomarker of elastin degradation and tissue injury [ 51 52 5.2.2. Lysine Hydroxylation Hydroxylysine is formed primarily from lysine present in collagen, the chief structural protein of mammalian skin and connective tissue, using lysyl hydroxylase ( Figure 5 Certain hydroxylysine residues in collagen molecules form chemical bonds with sugars, primarily galactose and glucosyl-galactose, thus contributing to collagen’s toughness and resiliency. Another function of hydroxylysine residues is participating in the crosslinking of collagen molecules via covalent bonds. The formation is catalyzed by lysyl oxidase, which deaminates the lysine or hydroxylysine residues to the reactive aldehydes allysine or hydroxyallysine, respectively. These then react without the participation of enzymes with a nearby lysine or hydroxylysine ε-amino group to form intermolecular links (previous section). This crosslinking is essential for the biomechanical properties of collagen and bone mineralization, which starts in gaps adjacent to crosslinks [ 53 Hydroxylysine released during collagen degradation cannot be reused for protein synthesis, and it is catabolized via the allysine pathway or excreted in the urine. Hence, urinary excretion of hydroxylysine and its glycosides can be used along with hydroxyproline as an index of collagen degradation [ 54 55 5.2.3. Formation of Covalent Bonds Between Glutamine and Lysine Residues The ε-amino group of lysine residues is a substrate for transglutaminases, which catalyze the formation of covalent bonds and crosslinks, primarily with amide groups of glutamine residues ( Figure 6 56 5.2.4. Lysine Methylation Lysine methylation and demethylation by protein lysine methyltransferases (\"writers\") and demethylases (\"erasers\") form mono-, di-, and trimethyl lysine residues. Methylated lysine residues in histones recognized by distinct effector proteins (\"readers\") in a manner that depends on the neighboring amino acid sequence and methylation state play a crucial role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and contribute to various biological processes [ 46 57 58 45 46 Section 5.4 5.2.5. Lysine Ubiquitination Ubiquitination is the term used for the attachment of a small regulatory protein called ubiquitin to a protein molecule, primarily on the ε-amino group of lysine residues. The \"writer\" is a complex of three enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). A polyubiquitin chain attached to lysine residue labels the proteins intended for ATP-dependent proteolysis in proteasomes and stimulates various downstream signals involved, such as apoptosis, cell cycle control, NF-κB activation, and DNA repair [ 58 59 5.2.6. Lysine Sumoylation Sumoylation is characterized by a bond of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein to lysine residues within specific motifs of many substrates. Four SUMO isoforms have been identified. Like ubiquitination, sumoylation is a reversible process that involves three classes of enzymes and can be reversed by specific proteases. Sumoylation is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, immune response, and epigenetic induction or repression of certain genes. Unlike ubiquitination, sumoylation is not used to tag proteins for degradation. The dysregulation of the SUMO system is associated with many diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegeneration [ 60 61 5.2.7. Lysine Neddylation Neddylation is a reversible binding of a ubiquitin-like protein termed neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8) to the lysine residue of the substrate protein. Like ubiquitination and sumoylation, neddylation is catalyzed by the enzyme cascade, namely, NEDD8 activating enzyme (E1), NEDD8 conjugating enzyme (E2), and NEDD8 ligase (E3). Deneddylation by specific deneddylases releases free NEDD8 for another cycle of neddylation. Neddylation substrates are classified into cullins and non-cullin proteins. Cullins support ubiquitin ligases (E3) and play a role in protein degradation. Non-cullin substrates include, for example, oncogenes, ribosomal proteins, histones, and transcription factors. The neddylation pathway is abnormally activated in various diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiomyopathies, atherosclerosis, and chronic liver diseases [ 62 63 5.2.8. Lysine Acylation According to the differences in hydrocarbon chain length, lysine acylation includes acetylation, propionylation, butyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, crotonylation, etc. Acylation is sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell, primarily the level of a particular acyl-CoA. Lysine acetylation has been widely studied. Reversible acetylation of the epsilon amino group of the side chain lysine residues is controlled by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), the \"writers\", which use acetyl-CoA as a substrate. In the mitochondria, lysine acetylation can also occur nonenzymatically. Deacetylation is achieved by deacetylases (KDACs), the \"erasers\", which include Zn 2+ + Figure 7 Acetylation neutralizes the positively charged lysine residues and blocks other lysine modifications, such as ubiquitination. Like methylation, lysine acetylation/deacetylation has been extensively studied in histones. Bromodomain-containing proteins, \"readers\" of lysine acetylation, can recognize acetylated lysine residues and influence gene transcription and transduce the signal carried by acetylated lysine residues into various normal or abnormal phenotypes [ 47 47 48 64 5.2.9. Lysine Lactylation Lysine lactylation involves the covalent linkage of lactate to lysine residues in proteins, primarily histones, induced by lactate accumulation. Histone lysine lactylation alters chromatin spatial configuration and the expression of associated genes. Lactylation plays a significant role in immune regulation, cell cycle, vascular function, and tumor development [ 65 5.2.10. Lysine Carbamylation Carbamylation or carbamoylation refers to a reaction of cyanates (NCO − 2 Figure 8 Increased carbamylation has been linked to complications of chronic renal diseases, including renal fibrogenesis, cataracts, and rheumatoid arthritis [ 66 67 44 67 5.2.11. Glycation In glycation, the aldehyde group of a reducing sugar binds nonenzymatically to a free amino group of a protein, primarily lysine and arginine residues, initiating a series of changes known as Maillard reactions. The consequence is the crosslinking of protein segments, resulting in altered conformation and protein function. The interaction of glycation and the influence of reactive oxygen species leads to the formation of substances referred to as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), such as pentosidine and glyoxal lysine, crosslinking of protein segments, altered function of the protein, and possible tissue damage. For instance, glycation of the collagen of the basal membranes of glomeruli leads to the development of glomerulosclerosis in patients with diabetes [ 68 5.3. Lysine as a Substrate for Homoarginine Synthesis Homoarginine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that differs from arginine by an additional methylene (-CH 2 69 Figure 9 The main pathway is via arginine:glycine amidinotransferase. When lysine is the substrate instead of glycine, the enzyme does not catalyze the synthesis of guanidinoacetate (Arg + Gly → Orn + guanidinoacetate), the precursor of creatine, but the synthesis of homoarginine (Arg + Lys → Orn + homoarginine). A less significant pathway is via argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase (enzymes of the urea cycle) from homocitrulline formed from lysine by ornithine carbamoyltransferase when lysine is used as a substrate instead of ornithine or by the reaction of lysine with cyanates (carbamylation), especially in uremia [ 70 71 Figure 9 Homoarginine synthesis from lysine and potential pathways of its metabolism. 1, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT); 2, ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT); 3, argininosuccinate synthetase; 4, argininosuccinate lyase; 5, NO synthase; 6, arginase; 7, alanine–glyoxylate aminotransferase. The box on the left shows a diagram of the role of AGAT in the synthesis of GA; the box on the right shows the role of OCT in citrulline synthesis. Abbreviations: CP, carbamoyl phosphate; GA, guanidinoacetate; GOCA, 6-guanidino-2-oxocaproic acid. Homoarginine serves as an alternative substrate of arginine for all three isoforms of NO synthase and, via N ω 72 73 74 Homoarginine concentration in human plasma ranges between 1 and 2 µmol/L. Several studies have demonstrated that a decrease in homoarginine concentration in diseases of the kidneys and cardiovascular system is associated with myocardial dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke [ 68 70 72 73 75 76 5.4. Lysine and Carnitine Synthesis Carnitine (β-hydroxy-trimethylammonium butyrate) is essential for the transport of higher fatty acids into the mitochondria to be oxidized ( Figure 10 77 78 79 The effects of carnitine are being studied in obesity; athletes; pregnancy; ischemic heart disease; liver injury; and diseases of the nervous system, including depression, dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases [ 80 81 82 83 84 85 Disorders of carnitine synthesis due to TML-dioxygenase or butyrobetaine dioxygenase mutation are usually not associated with carnitine deficiency because most of it is obtained from the diet [ 86 86 87 It has been shown that a moderate excess of dietary lysine lowers plasma and tissue carnitine concentrations in pigs [ 88 89 90 5.5. Lysine Decarboxylation to Cadaverine Cadaverine is a foul-smelling diamine formed by lysine decarboxylase expressed in bacteria but not in animal tissues ( Figure 11 91 92 93 6. Lysine as a Dietary Supplement and Its Therapeutic Potential There are several applications of lysine use as a dietary supplement; the potential application of the phenomenon of lysine–arginine antagonism ( Section 3 Figure 12 6.1. Prophylaxis and Therapy of Lysine Deficiency Lysine deficiency may occur in poor countries and groups of people with low socioeconomic status, where cereals are a staple food providing poor-quality protein, and in people who consume low-protein diets, such as vegetarians and patients with chronic renal failure. A marked lysine deficiency has been observed in children with kwashiorkor [ 94 95 10 91 Several articles have described the nutritional benefits of lysine oral supplements, grain legumes, and lysine-fortified diets for the therapy of kwashiorkor and proper development, primarily in children and adolescents, general well-being, and prevention of cardiometabolic disorders [ 1 2 8 94 95 96 6.2. Muscle Performance Lysine is a precursor of carnitine that is involved in fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and, like arginine and some other amino acids, stimulates growth hormone release and its concentrations in plasma [ 97 98 99 100 Unfortunately, most published data do not support this assumption, and no properly conducted scientific studies have shown that oral lysine supplementation before strength training increases muscle performance to a greater extent than strength training alone [ 99 101 6.3. Herpes Simplex Infections Therapy Because exogenous arginine is essential for forming capsid proteins of the herpes simplex virus and its multiplication, the displacement of arginine by L-lysine is used to treat herpetic infections (cold sores). The therapeutic forms include an ointment and L-lysine hydrochloride orally in 1–3 g/day dosages. Unfortunately, a recent literature review uncovered no convincing evidence that lysine is effective in treating herpes simplex lesions [ 4 6.4. Modulation of Immune and Cardiovascular Functions Lysine levels are decreased in nascent metabolic syndrome and negatively correlate with cardio-metabolic features and inflammatory biomarkers [ 102 25 103 6.5. Cancer Therapy Lysine is the most utilized essential amino acid in some types of cancer, whereas arginine has been proven to exhibit anti-cancer effects [ 3 104 3 104 105 45 46 47 48 61 62 63 65 6.6. Elimination of Harmful Substances Lysine proved to inhibit the tubular reabsorption of positively charged proteins and peptides appearing in primary urine due to its binding to negatively charged proximal tubular cells. The effect of lysine was higher when compared with other positively charged amino acids, including ornithine, arginine, and ε-amino-caproic acid [ 106 107 108 109 6.7. Osteoporosis Therapy Animal and human studies demonstrated that lysine enhances intestinal and renal calcium absorption and the potential usefulness of L-lysine supplements for both preventive and therapeutic interventions in osteoporosis [ 110 111 112 113 114 115 6.8. Wound Healing Lysine is essential for the synthesis of collagen and elastin; the formation of crosslinks with glutamine resistant to mechanical influences; and the stabilization of the extracellular matrix, hemostasis, and the activation of growth factors [ 50 56 116 117 118 6.9. Polylysine and Therapy of Viral Infections Amino groups located both at the α-carbon and the ε-carbon of lysine can be used to form peptides called α-polylysine or ε-polylysine, which contain a positively charged hydrophilic amino group and can bind to negatively charged surfaces of cells or proteins. α-Polylysine is commonly used to coat culture materials as an adhesion factor; ε-polylysine exerts antibacterial activity and is used as a food preservative, primarily in Japan and Korea [ 119 120 Because some viruses form noninfectious complexes with polylysine, nanomaterials derived from lysine have been investigated as an option to prevent the replication of viruses and their entry into the cells. Polylysine deposited on the surface of human T-lymphocytes proved to have an inhibitory influence on the replication of human immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, human cytomegalovirus, and SARS [ 7 121 6.10. Lysine Analogs and Prevention of Bleeding Tranexamic and ε-aminocaproic acid are lysine analogues with affinity to lysine binding sites of plasminogen to fibrin, resulting in inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin that degrades the fibrin clots. These drugs are used as antifibrinolytic agents to reduce bleeding in trauma, surgery, cancer, and hematological disorders [ 5 6 7. Adverse Effects of Increased Lysine Intake The lysine dose associated with no observed adverse effect (NOAEL) in humans was determined at 6 g per day for long-term use [ 122 122 123 However, several animal studies have demonstrated the detrimental effects of lysine on the kidneys. A high intravenous dose of lysine (600 mg/rat over 4 h) decreased glomerular filtration. It produced the morphological picture of acute tubular necrosis, whereas equivalent glycine, arginine, and glutamate doses produced no significant renal morphologic or functional changes [ 124 125 126 Several articles have demonstrated that excessive intake of a single amino acid can decrease the availability of other amino acids and significantly affect the whole body’s metabolism [ 127 101 25 103 128 129 8. Summary and Conclusions The results of studies referred to in this article demonstrate that lysine is an essential amino acid with a unique role in protein metabolism, nutrition, and epigenetic regulation. However, more work should be performed to obtain clear information on its physiological role and therapeutic potential. First, it is necessary to reach conclusions about the importance of the pipecolate pathway of lysine catabolism in the brain and its role in neurometabolic disorders. Essential is a better understanding of the control of PTMs of lysine residues in proteins and their role in epigenetics. The challenge for biochemists and molecular biologists is to characterize the structure and function of writers, erasers, and readers of lysine PTMs. Further research is required to explore the role of lysine availability in homoarginine formation and how the phenomenon of lysine–arginine antagonism can be used to influence immune and cardiovascular systems and cancer. Of unique importance is the investigation of the therapeutic potential of lysine analogs and polylysine. Given the possible use of lysine to reduce the resorption of radionuclides and other harmful substances in the kidneys, its maximum dose without nephrotoxic effects must be determined. In summary, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge of lysine metabolism and its role in various physiological and pathological conditions, and most of its potential therapeutic applications have not been unequivocally proven.
