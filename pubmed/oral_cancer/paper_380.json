Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 247 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, treated at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Liaoning Cancer Hospital, between January 2015 and December 2020. The patients received two different neoadjuvant radiotherapy regimens: In the experimental group, the prescribed radiation dose for the primary rectal tumor and metastatic lymph nodes (PGTV) was 50.4 Gy/24 fractions, and for the pelvic lymphatic drainage area (PTV) was 45.6 Gy/24 fractions. In the control group, the prescribed radiation dose for the rectal tumor and pelvic lymphatic drainage area (PTV) was 50 Gy/25 fractions. The primary endpoints of the study included comparing the two groups in terms of pathological complete response (pCR), anal sphincter preservation rate, 3-year overall survival (OS), 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), acute adverse reactions, perioperative complications, preventive ileostomy reversal rate after LAR, and late adverse reactions. The secondary endpoints included comparing tumor regression grade (TRG), pT downstaging rate, pN downstaging rate, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), 3-year metastasis-free survival (MFS), and 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify clinical factors influencing prognosis. Results This study included 247 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, all of whom underwent synchronous chemoradiotherapy and radical total mesorectal excision (TME). The experimental group showed comparable results to the control group in terms of pCR rate, anal sphincter preservation rate, TRG grade, pT and pN downstaging rates, as well as 3-year OS, PFS, DFS, MFS, and LRFS ( P Conclusions Compared to the control group, the experimental group, which utilized a reduced radiation dose for the pelvic lymphatic drainage area, achieved a significantly lower incidence of ≥ 3 grade acute adverse reactions, fewer perioperative complications, and a higher preventive ileostomy reversal rate without any severe perioperative mortality, thereby enhancing the patients' quality of life, without compromising short-term efficacy or survival outcomes.

Additionally, 27.7% (13/47) of patients undergoing LAR and 37.1% (23/62) undergoing APR developed serious perioperative complications such as anastomotic leaks and perineal wound dehiscence [ 7 9 10 8 11 12 In clinical practice, some centers administer 45 Gy as the prescribed dose for neoadjuvant treatment of LARC patients, while others use 50 Gy [ 13 14 Methods Participants This study included patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) at Liaoning Cancer Hospital between January 2015 and December 2020. Inclusion criteria were: pathological diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma; age between 18 and 75 years; clinical stage II or III (cT2-4/N + M0) prior to treatment; low or mid rectal cancer (tumor ≤ 10 cm from the anal verge); Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70; no severe comorbidities. Exclusion criteria included: inability to tolerate CRT or surgery; multiple primary cancers; distant metastasis prior to or during treatment; prior pelvic radiotherapy; incomplete clinical data; and recurrent rectal cancer. The study included patients who were assigned to either the experimental or control group based on clinical decisions. These decisions were made considering factors such as patient's willingness, patient condition, and physician discretion, without a formal randomization process. While this design carries a risk of selection bias, we plan to address this limitation in future studies by employing propensity score matching, which could compensate for the potential bias introduced by the non-random assignment of patients. This study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Liaoning Provincial Cancer Hospital (KY20231116). All patients included in this study provided retrospective informed consent for the use of their medical data, in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics Committee. Treatment protocol In the experimental group, the prescribed radiation dose for the primary rectal tumor and metastatic lymph nodes (PGTV) was 50.4 Gy/24 fractions, and for the pelvic lymphatic drainage area (PTV) was 45.6 Gy/24 fractions. The experimental group was treated using Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB), allowing for differential dosing within the target areas. In the control group, the prescribed dose for PTV was 50 Gy/25 fractions. Both groups were treated with 6MV X-ray IMRT or VMAT technology, with the prescription dose covering at least 95% of the target volume. Contouring and Volume Definition: Radiation treatment planning adhered to institutional protocols, with contouring performed using the RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) guidelines. The GTV (Gross Target Volume) was identified based on imaging modalities such as colonoscopy, CT, and MRI. For the experimental group, the PGTV was delineated by expanding the GTV by 0.5 cm in the lateral and anterior–posterior directions, and 0.5–1 cm in the superior-inferior direction. The CTV (Clinical Target Volume) for both groups included the GTV plus high-risk pelvic lymphatic drainage areas, specifically the mesorectal, presacral, internal iliac, and obturator regions. For the PTV, a 0.7 cm lateral and anterior–posterior expansion, and a 1 cm superior-inferior expansion, were applied to account for treatment uncertainties and setup variations. During radiation therapy, both groups received concurrent oral capecitabine chemotherapy at a dose of 825 mg/m 2 2 2 Follow-up The follow-up began from the date of the first radiation treatment, with the last follow-up occurring on January 20, 2024. Follow-up methods included outpatient visits, inpatient care, and telephone consultations. Patients were followed up every 3 months during the first two years, every 6 months from years 3 to 5, and annually thereafter. Follow-up assessments included colonoscopy, pelvic-enhanced MRI, chest CT, upper and lower abdominal enhanced CT, blood tests, and tumor markers. Evaluation of treatment response During concurrent chemoradiotherapy, weekly assessments of blood counts, liver function, renal function, and serum electrolytes were conducted. Acute adverse reactions were recorded, and late-stage adverse reactions were documented via outpatient visits, hospital admissions, and telephone follow-ups. Acute reactions were evaluated using the RTOG acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria, while late adverse effects were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Perioperative complications (within 30 days post-surgery) were assessed using the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Treatment efficacy was primarily evaluated based on tumor regression grading (TRG), pathological complete response (pCR), and postoperative downstaging of T and N stages. TRG was assessed using the Mandard classification. pCR was defined as the absence of tumor cells in the resected specimen (pT0N0M0). Downstaging of pT and pN was evaluated by comparing pre-treatment clinical staging with post-surgical pathological staging to assess any stage reduction. Endpoints The primary endpoints of this study included comparison of pCR rates, anal sphincter preservation rates, 3-year overall survival (OS), 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), acute adverse reactions, perioperative complications, ileostomy reversal rates after LAR, and late adverse reactions. Secondary endpoints included comparison of postoperative TRG, pT downstaging rates, pN downstaging rates, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), 3-year metastatic-free survival (MFS), and 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), along with univariate and multivariate analysis of clinical factors influencing prognosis. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS version 29.0, with Chi-square tests for comparing differences between the groups. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were constructed for OS, PFS, DFS, MFS, and LRFS. Clinical factors potentially influencing prognosis, including age, gender, diabetes status, tumor staging, radiotherapy regimen, pCR, TRG, postoperative T and N stages, cancer nodules, baseline CEA, baseline CA199, CRT post-CEA, and CRT post-CA199, were analyzed by Log-rank tests for univariate analysis, and Cox regression models for multivariate analysis. A P Results Baseline characteristics This study included 247 patients diagnosed with low and mid rectal cancer (LARC), with 122 in the experimental group and 125 in the control group, all having a median age of 59 years.

The median time from radiotherapy to surgery was 9 weeks in both groups. The distribution of surgical procedures was similar between the two groups, with 56.6% of the experimental group and 54.4% of the control group undergoing LAR surgery. The anal sphincter preservation rate was 56.6% in the experimental group and 54.4% in the control group. In terms of surgical resection margins, the experimental group achieved an R0 resection rate of 96.7%, compared to 96.8% in the control group. The experimental group had a pT downstaging rate of 72.1%, while the control group had a rate of 66.4%. The pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 18.0% in the experimental group and 16.0% in the control group. Postoperative TRG scores revealed that 18.0% of the experimental group achieved TRG1, 50.0% achieved TRG2, 27.0% achieved TRG3, and 5.0% achieved TRG4. In the control group, 16.0% achieved TRG1, 41.6% achieved TRG2, 37.6% achieved TRG3, and 4.8% achieved TRG4.

However, the experimental group’s pCR rate of 18.0% indicates substantial potential for further improvement. While the 3-year overall survival (OS) rates between the experimental and control groups did not show statistical significance (92.6% vs. 86.4%, respectively), the observed numerical difference of 6.2% is clinically meaningful. This difference suggests that the experimental approach may offer potential benefits in survival outcomes, which could be particularly relevant in clinical practice when assessing treatment strategies for locally advanced rectal cancer. Although not statistically significant, a 6.2% improvement in OS could represent a substantial clinical advantage, especially when coupled with the reduced acute toxicity and perioperative complications observed in the experimental group. These findings warrant further investigation in larger, prospective studies to explore whether this difference could translate into long-term survival benefits. Numerous studies have highlighted that in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) who undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and TME surgery, a higher pCR rate correlates closely with a reduced risk of recurrence and improved survival benefits. For instance, Hernando et al. used a higher radiation dose (57.5 Gy/23 fractions) and observed a pCR rate of 30.6% among patients [ 15 16 17 This study introduces an innovative treatment approach by reducing the radiation dose to the pelvic lymphatic drainage area. While no significant differences were observed in survival outcomes compared to traditional regimens, the experimental approach notably reduced acute adverse reactions and perioperative complications. Recent studies have shown that using modern technologies like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can further reduce acute gastrointestinal toxicity. For instance, the Colib French study demonstrated that the use of IMRT in neoadjuvant (chemo) radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer led to a significant reduction in severe toxicity (5%) compared to conformal radiotherapy, without compromising efficacy. This is in line with our approach of reducing radiation exposure to healthy tissues, particularly in the pelvic lymphatic drainage area, while preserving therapeutic efficacy [ 18 This suggests that by judiciously adjusting radiation doses, it is possible to protect surrounding healthy tissues and minimize radiotherapy toxicity, without compromising therapeutic efficacy. Future studies may explore further enhancing the radiation dose to the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes while maintaining a lower dose for the pelvic lymphatic drainage area, which could potentially increase the pCR rate and improve long-term survival outcomes. This approach not only holds promise for enhancing treatment effectiveness but also for reducing side effects and improving patients’ quality of life, offering substantial clinical potential. In postoperative pathological assessment, TRG grading, pT staging, and pN staging have long been recognized as crucial predictors of long-term prognosis in LARC patients, and this study confirms their importance [ 19 24 21 19 Moreover, this study extends our understanding of personalized postoperative treatment strategies, particularly in the context of treatment adjustments based on TRG and pT, pN staging. Similar to other studies, TRG grading in univariate analysis had a significant impact on survival prognosis, but in multivariate analysis, T and N staging emerged as more prominent predictors. This finding suggests that a personalized adjuvant chemotherapy regimen based on a comprehensive assessment of TRG, pT, and pN staging could further improve long-term survival rates and reduce unnecessary overtreatment. Future research should explore how results from TRG and TNM staging can guide more precise individualized treatment plans. However, this study has some limitations, notably its retrospective design and relatively small sample size. The study did not perform a formal sample size calculation, and the retrospective nature of the study limits the statistical power to detect clinically meaningful differences between the groups. The lack of statistical power could explain the absence of significant survival differences between the experimental and control groups, highlighting the need for larger, prospective studies with appropriate power calculations to verify these findings. The inherent risk of selection bias in this single-center, retrospective study, and the possible influence of unmeasured confounding factors. Nevertheless, the results provide strong reference value for comparing survival outcomes and side effects between the experimental and control groups. The potential impact of non-randomized treatment allocation on the comparability of the groups, which could lead to systematic differences that may not be fully adjusted for by baseline characteristics. To ensure the generalizability and reliability of the findings, future research should expand the sample size and implement prospective studies with extended follow-up periods to observe long-term survival and recurrence patterns. Additionally, the limitation in the generalizability of the findings due to the study being conducted at a single institution, emphasizing the need for multi-center studies to validate these results. Furthermore, there were some data omissions and potential selection biases, which could affect the accuracy of the conclusions. Future studies should improve the comprehensiveness of data collection and optimize patient selection criteria to mitigate these biases. In conclusion, the innovative approach of reducing radiation doses to the pelvic lymphatic drainage area in this study has demonstrated its ability to reduce acute adverse reactions and perioperative complications. Although the pCR rate leaves room for improvement, this study offers new insights and methods for enhancing treatment efficacy, minimizing side effects, and improving the quality of life in LARC patients. Future research should focus on increasing the radiation dose to primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes while maintaining lower doses for the pelvic lymphatic drainage area to further enhance pCR rates and long-term survival. Additionally, integrating serum markers (e.g., CEA and CA199) and pathological assessments (e.g., TRG, pT, and pN staging) into comprehensive analyses will provide more accurate foundations for personalized treatment strategies. Conclusion The experimental group demonstrated comparable outcomes to the control group in terms of short-term efficacy and survival outcomes. However, given the limitations of this study, these findings should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive conclusions, and further validation through randomized controlled trials is needed. In comparison to the control group, and without compromising survival efficacy, the experimental group, which adopted a regimen of reduced radiation doses to the pelvic lymphatic drainage area, exhibited a significantly lower incidence of ≥ 3 grade acute adverse reactions, fewer perioperative complications, and a higher rate of preventive ileostomy reversal. Additionally, no severe perioperative adverse events leading to death occurred, thereby enhancing the patients' quality of life. These results suggest that a reduced radiation dose to the pelvic lymphatic drainage area may offer potential benefits, which should be verified in future studies. Univariate analysis revealed that gender, TRG grading, postoperative T stage, postoperative N stage, and cancer nodules were significant factors influencing OS, PFS, DFS, MFS, and LRFS. Baseline CEA was identified as a significant factor affecting PFS, while baseline CA199 was found to influence OS, PFS, DFS, and MFS. CRT post-CA199 was found to affect OS, DFS, and MFS. Multivariate analysis further demonstrated that baseline CA199 was an independent prognostic factor for OS, PFS, and DFS, postoperative N stage was an independent prognostic factor for OS, PFS, DFS, and MFS, and postoperative T stage was an independent prognostic factor for OS, PFS, DFS, and LRFS. These prognostic factors should be considered in future prospective trials to further refine treatment strategies and validate their predictive value in larger cohorts.
