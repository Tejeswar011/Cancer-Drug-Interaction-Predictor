In most cancers, it acts as a protective factor by slowing down cancer growth and triggering cell death. However, in a rare type of muscle cancer, it is hijacked to promote tumor development. This review explains how RASSF4 is controlled by chemical changes that switch it on or off, and how its behavior changes across cancer types. We discuss poten-tial treatments aimed at restoring RASSF4’s protective function in cancers where it is silenced, or blocking its harmful effects where it is overactive. We also highlight its promise as a diagnostic tool and a target for therapy. Our findings may help guide the development of more precise cancer treatments in the future, benefiting patients through improved therapeutic strategies. Abstract RASSF4 is a key member of the Ras-associated domain family (RASSF) that exhibits dual functionality in tumorigenesis, playing critical yet context-dependent roles in various malignancies. Its expression is epigenetically regulated through promoter hypermethylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs including miR-155 and miR-196a-5p, which directly target its 3′ untranslated region. In most cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), RASSF4 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the RAS/MAPK pathway while activating the Hippo signaling cascade, ultimately inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conversely, in aRMS, RASSF4 is upregulated by the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion oncoprotein and promotes tumor growth through MST1 inhibition and subsequent YAP activation. This review systematically analyzes current evidence regarding RASSF4’s complex regulatory mechanisms and clinical significance. We propose targeted therapeutic strategies including epigenetic reactivation, gene intervention, and combination therapies. Furthermore, we identify RASSF4 as a promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target based on integrated mechanistic and clinical evidence. Future research should focus on elucidating context-dependent regulatory switches, developing targeted delivery systems, and validating clinical utility through prospective trials.

Introduction The mammalian RASSF proteins are designated RASSF1 to RASSF10 [ 1 2 3 4 Figure 1 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 RASSFs possess no reported enzymatic activity and likely function as adaptor or scaffold proteins in multiprotein complexes [ 4 12 13 RASSF RASSF1A RASSF2 RASSF4 RASSF5 RASSF6 14 The human RASSF4 15 16 15 17 18 19 At present, therapeutic strategies targeting RASSF proteins mainly focus on using epigenetic drugs to reverse the hypermethylation of its promoter, thereby restoring its tumor suppressor function. In this field, the research on RASSF1A is relatively mature, especially the microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MBR) adenovirus system strategy based on RASSF1A, modulator of apoptosis 1 (MOAP1), and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) loading, showing significant potential in reversing drug resistance in solid tumors [ 20 21 22 23 This review aims to summarize the molecular mechanisms of RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 2. Cell Biological Processes Involving RASSF4 RASSF4 Figure 2 2.1. Proliferation Uncontrolled activation of proliferation is a core pathological mechanism driving tumorigenesis and fibrosis progression. It disrupts the balance of cell cycle regulation, promoting abnormal tissue proliferation and organ dysfunction, thereby accelerating the progression of malignant tumors [ 24 25 RASSF4 2 RASSF4 26 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 27 3 RASSF4 16 RASSF4 28 RASSF4 RASSF4 29 RASSF4 19 RASSF4 RASSF4 30 Tumor stem cells drive malignant tumor growth through their ability to continuously self-renew and indefinitely proliferate. They also resist radiotherapy and chemotherapy by leveraging their high DNA repair capacity and quiescent state, making them the root cause of tumor recurrence and resistance [ 31 32 RASSF4 RASSF4 30 RASSF4 33 In summary, RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 2.2. Apoptosis Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death that is critical for animal development and tissue homeostasis [ 34 35 RASSF4 12 36 16 RASSF4 BAX PUMA 29 RASSF4 37 RASSF4 2.3. Functional Activities of the Plasma Membrane As a dynamic signaling hub, the plasma membrane coordinates material transport, signal transduction, and cell adhesion to mediate communication between the intracellular and extracellular environments. Dysfunction of the plasma membrane is closely associated with pathological processes such as tumors and infectious diseases [ 38 39 40 RASSF4 2 41 2 10 RASSF4 42 RASSF4 3. Clinical Significance of RASSF4 3.1. As a Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker RASSF4 43 RASSF4 28 RASSF4 44 RASSF4 RASSF4 3 3.2. Role in Disease Progression During the initiation stage of disease, RASSF4 18 43 RASSF4 36 RASSF4 RASSF4 29 45 In tumor progression, dysregulation of core pathways drives malignant proliferation. RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 16 26 27 29 During the invasion and metastasis stage, microenvironmental remodeling promotes dissemination, with RASSF4 19 44 46 47 In the treatment resistance stage, drug resistance mechanisms form, with chemotherapy resistance arising from p53 pathway inhibition and enhanced drug efflux. In AML, p53 activity decreases by 65% and apoptosis decreases by 70%; in HCC, the IC50 of sorafenib increases. Targeted therapy escapes manifests as the response rate to YAP inhibitors dropping to 28%, while epigenetic drugs can restore RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 28 45 48 4. Roles of RASSF4 Tumorigenesis and tumor progression are complex biological processes involving multiple factors and stages. RASSF4 RASSF4 27 Figure 3 Figure 4 4.1. Mechanisms of How RASSF4 Inhibits Tumor Progression RASSF4 RASSF4 2 27 36 3 44 49 RASSF4 RASSF4 29 43 50 RASSF4 2 RASSF4 36 Studies have confirmed that the RASSF4 RASSF4 27 36 RASSF4 16 26 RASSF4 28 47 It is worth noting that the function of RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 18 51 52 47 RASSF4 4.2. Mechanisms by Which RASSF4 Promotes Tumor Progression Although RASSF4 RASSF4 53 RASSF4 RASSF4 53 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 54 RASSF4 19 55 4.3. RASSF4 Regulation of the Cell Microenvironment and Immunity As a critical factor in cellular survival and function, the cell microenvironment provides a central pathological basis for disease onset and progression through disrupted homeostasis. In tumor biology, the tumor microenvironment (TME) modulates key biological processes such as immune evasion, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. This creates pathological conditions that are conducive to the malignant proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells [ 56 57 58 RASSF4 29 RASSF4 In terms of immune regulation, studies have found that RASSF4 46 RASSF4 RASSF4 In terms of angiogenesis, studies have confirmed that RASSF4 19 RASSF4 45 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 4.4. The Potential Influence of Tumor Microenvironment Characteristics on RASSF4 Functions Korz et al. reported that RASSF4 59 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 60 4.5. The Relationship Between Genetic Changes in Tumor Cells and the Functioning of This Protein Although RAS mutations are frequently observed in MM and drive oncogenic signaling through pathways such as MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT, Eva et.al indicate that the tumor-suppressive function of RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 16 5.

Therapeutic Potential and Future Directions for Targeting RASSF4 Building upon the established regulatory mechanisms underlying RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 Figure 6 Table 2 RASSF4 6.1. Epigenetic Reactivation Strategies Epigenetic modifications play a key role in tumorigenesis and progression [ 69 70 71 3 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 RASSF4 29 45 75 80 RASSF4 48 In addition to DNA methylation, histone modifications are also important epigenetic mechanisms that influence gene expression states and drug sensitivity [ 81 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 16 82 83 In aRMS, the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein recruits histone demethylase (KDM3B), which reduces H3K9 methylation levels and promotes the expression of the oncogenic target gene PAX3-FOXO1 [ 53 RASSF4 RASSF4 19 With the rapid development of precision medicine, the use of demethylating agents has become an important strategy in cancer therapy [ 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 Currently, commonly used clinical demethylating drugs such as decitabine and azacitidine can significantly reduce genomic methylation levels, but their clinical application still faces three major challenges: drug toxicity issues, including gastrointestinal reactions, bone marrow suppression, and increased risk of opportunistic infections; therapeutic heterogeneity manifested as significant differences in response rates across different tumor types and even subtypes of the same tumor; drug resistance issues, which manifest as long-term use leading to the reconstruction of methylation patterns and the activation of drug metabolism enzymes [ 91 92 93 6.2. miRNA-Mediated Regulation of RASSF4 and Therapeutic Prospects In addition to DNA methylation, histone acetylation and microRNA (miRNA) also participate in the regulation of RASSF4 94 95 96 97 98 99 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 28 44 100 101 Small-molecule drugs have long been the preferred treatment for cancer [ 102 98 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 111 112 113 114 Developing a safe and efficient delivery system for miRNA therapy is a key challenge in its clinical application. Current delivery strategies are primarily divided into two major categories: viral vectors and non-viral vectors. In the viral vector field, AAV has become one of the most commonly used viral vectors in gene therapy due to its low integration risk and sustained expression of exogenous genes. Currently, three investigational drugs utilize viral vectors, namely the AAV9, AAVrh, and AAV5 delivery systems [ 115 TM 116 117 Therapeutic strategies targeting RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 6.3. Direct Gene Delivery for RASSF4 Restoration Epigenetic regulation and miRNA intervention can restore RASSF4 RASSF4 Studies have shown that abnormal downregulation of RASSF4 27 50 RASSF4 RASSF4 118 119 120 121 122 On the other hand, for specific pathological states driven by RASSF4 RASSF4 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 In summary, gene intervention strategies that directly target RASSF4 6.4. Combination Therapy and Pathway Synergy Strategies While monotherapy targeting RASSF4 RASSF4 The synergistic use of gene therapy and chemotherapy drugs has characteristics such as simultaneous blockade of multiple pathways, complementary therapeutic targets, and increased drug sensitivity [ 130 131 132 133 134 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 2 27 29 44 RASSF4 45 RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 27 28 49 Therapeutic strategies targeting RASSF4 RASSF4 RASSF4 7.
