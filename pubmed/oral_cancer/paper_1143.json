Their rapid, sensitive detection in biofluids such as saliva—a non-invasive, real-time diagnostic medium—offers transformative potential for early disease identification and personalized health monitoring. This review synthesizes advancements in electrochemical sensor technologies tailored for Trp and Tryp quantification, emphasizing their clinical relevance in diagnosing conditions like oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and breast cancer, where dysregulated Trp metabolism reflects immune dysfunction or tumor progression. Electrochemical platforms have overcome the limitations of conventional techniques (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and mass spectrometry) by integrating innovative nanomaterials and smart engineering strategies. Carbon-based architectures, such as graphene (Gr) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) functionalized with metal nanoparticles (Ni and Co) or nitrogen dopants, amplify electron transfer kinetics and catalytic activity, achieving sub-nanomolar detection limits. Synergies between doping and advanced functionalization—via aptamers (Apt), molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), or metal-oxide hybrids—impart exceptional selectivity, enabling the precise discrimination of Trp and Tryp in complex matrices like saliva. Mechanistically, redox reactions at the indole ring are optimized through tailored electrode interfaces, which enhance reaction kinetics and stability over repeated cycles. Translational strides include 3D-printed microfluidics and wearable sensors for continuous intraoral health surveillance, demonstrating clinical utility in detecting elevated Trp levels in OSCC and breast cancer. These platforms align with point-of-care (POC) needs through rapid response times, minimal fouling, and compatibility with scalable fabrication. However, challenges persist in standardizing saliva collection, mitigating matrix interference, and validating biomarkers across diverse populations. Emerging solutions, such as AI-driven analytics and antifouling coatings, coupled with interdisciplinary efforts to refine device integration and manufacturing, are critical to bridging these gaps. By harmonizing material innovation with clinical insights, electrochemical sensors promise to revolutionize precision medicine, offering cost-effective, real-time diagnostics for both localized oral pathologies and systemic diseases. As the field advances, addressing stability and scalability barriers will unlock the full potential of these technologies, transforming them into indispensable tools for early intervention and tailored therapeutic monitoring in global healthcare. electrochemical sensors tryptophan tryptamine nanomaterials point-of-care diagnostics artificial intelligence Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award McMaster Faculty of Engineering Doctoral Scholarship for Multidisciplinary Research McMaster Start-up Grant Labarge Centre for Mobility in Aging within the McMaster Institute for Research on Aging Michael G.

Introduction Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential aromatic amino acid that serves as the biochemical precursor for a variety of critical metabolites, including serotonin (SR), melatonin, kynurenine (Kyn), and tryptamine (Tryp). These metabolites regulate a wide spectrum of physiological functions ranging from mood regulation and circadian rhythm to immune modulation and metabolic balance [ 1 2 3 1 4 5 6 7 Traditional laboratory-based analytical platforms, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), remain the gold standards for the accurate quantification of Trp and its metabolites [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 The electrochemical detection of Trp and Tryp, however, is fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic characteristics of their redox chemistry. Oxidation of the indole moiety involves an irreversible two-electron and two-proton transfer, leading to the formation of reactive indolequinone intermediates [ 11 12 14 15 16 17 In addition to material innovation, advances in device architecture have further improved sensor performance. Flexible substrates and microfluidic integration allow for adaptable designs that enable continuous monitoring in complex biological environments. Moreover, the incorporation of machine learning algorithms for signal deconvolution and data analysis has enhanced the ability of sensors to operate in real time while minimizing the impact of matrix interference [ 18 19 Previous reviews in this field have generally been limited in scope, often classifying sensors by electroanalytical technique, focusing on specific aspects such as enantiomeric discrimination, or using polymer-based designs [ 20 21 22 23 24 The structure of this review is as follows: Section 2 Section 3 Section 4 Section 5 Section 6 By synthesizing interdisciplinary advances in material science, electrochemistry, biomedical engineering, and data analytics, this review provides a roadmap for accelerating the development of robust, accessible, and clinically relevant biosensors for Trp and Tryp. In doing so, it seeks to underscore the unique novelty of these sensors, not only as analytical tools, but also as transformative platforms for precision medicine. 2. Trp and Tryp Biomarkers Trp is an amino acid which cannot be synthesized in the body and is supplemented in diet through foods such as turkey, milk and tuna. It has two enantiomers, L- and D-Trp, of which only L-Trp can cross the blood-brain barrier and is utilized in protein synthesis [ 25 26 25 25 Figure 1 27 Trp consists of an a-amino group, an a-carboxylic acid group, and a side-chain indole, which is a bicyclic ring formed by benzene and a pyrrole group attached to the a-carbon by a -CH 2 28 29 Table 1 The breakdown of the indole ring produces Kyn, which accounts for 90% of Trp catabolism and is a precursor to kynurenic and quinolinic acid (QA), which are important in the regulation of certain neurotransmitters [ 34 28 25 28 Tryp or indole-3-ethylamine is an indole compound with an electrophilic substituent in the pyrrole ring [ 5 5 35 2 17 35 17 Trp has many implications in processes related to aging. The most significant example is found in the Kyn pathway, specifically in the biological aging biomarker potential of the Kyn/Trp ratio [ 36 36 3. Current Methods of Trp and Tryp Detection Trp detection is challenging due to its unique properties that separate it from other amino acids. A big challenge is that the standard acidic condition used for the characterization of amino acids triggers the oxidative degeneration of Trp [ 37 37 37 38 39 Chromatography separates compounds through studying the interactions between the analyte and a particular solvent and identifying the separate components through these unique interactions [ 40 40 40 Mass spectrometry is typically used to separate electrically charged species in their gas phases [ 41 38 41 42 Optical detection, such as the colorimetric method, has also been used to detect Trp. In this method, Trp was converted to indole, which was able to react to form a pink-colored product [ 20 20 Electrochemical sensors use electrical energy to detect the interaction between an analyte and the sensor surface [ 13 43 44 17 45 46 47 17 48 4. Electrochemical Sensors for Trp and Tryp The electrochemical sensing of Trp showed an irreversible oxidation reaction that conforms to a two-electron/two-proton process [ 14 48 In addition to electrode modification strategies, considerable attention has been given to the standardization of biological samples such as serum, saliva, and milk, due to their inherent enzymatic and biomolecular complexity. Across the reviewed studies, several common pretreatment protocols were employed to minimize variability. pH levels were typically stabilized using phosphate or acetate buffers to preserve the electrochemical activity of Trp and Tryp. Proteins were frequently precipitated using organic solvents such as acetonitrile or methanol, followed by centrifugation to remove residues that might otherwise adsorb irreversibly to electrode surfaces [ 49 50 51 4.1. Trp-Sensing Electrodes Modified with Metal Nanoparticles AuNPs remain among the most effective modifiers for Trp-sensing electrodes due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability [ 52 53 54 52 53 Performance is further enhanced by hybridization strategies. For instance, combining AuNPs with dendritic gold nanostructures (DGNs) or Fe 3 4 2 Figure 2 R ct 53 54 Majidi et al. directly compared AuNP-based sensors by developing two configurations: (i) a gold screen-printed electrode (AuSPE) modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and (ii) an Apt-functionalized electrode integrating MWCNTs and AuNPs (AuE/MWCNTs/Apt) ( Figure 2 49 55 49 These studies collectively demonstrate that AuNPs offer unique versatility: they serve as platforms for functionalization rather than as passive modifiers. Hybrid AuNP-based electrodes balance sensitivity, selectivity, and stability, but their performance is ultimately determined by rational design choices. The critical lesson is that translational viability depends less on achieving ultralow LODs in the buffer, and more on reproducibility, stability, and antifouling in complex biofluids. The summarized comparisons in Table 2 Recent studies have demonstrated that metal and metal-oxide nanoparticles, beyond gold, play a pivotal role in enhancing the electrochemical sensing of Trp [ 59 60 61 Table 3 2 59 Similarly, UV-irradiated WO 3 3 60 61 4.2. Trp-Sensing Electrodes Modified with Carbon Derivatives Gr and CNTs are among the most widely used electrodes in this class owing to their exceptional electrical conductivity, large surface area, and tunable chemistry [ 63 However, pristine Gr is limited in electrochemical sensing due to its high production costs and strong aggregation via π–π stacking and van der Waals interactions [ 64 65 66 Table 4 TiO 2 70 2 4 2 4 71 2 46 Spinel-type composites, including N-rGO/CuCo 2 4 72 Figure 3 16 69 2 3 2 3 Figure 3 67 68 Figure 3 Overall, rGO-based composite electrodes significantly improve Trp sensing through enhanced electron transfer, increased surface area, and selective molecular interactions. A critical examination of the literature suggests that the most effective strategies involve combining rGO with catalytically active metals or doped nanostructures while carefully tuning surface chemistry and orientation for real-sample applicability. 4.3. Trp-Sensing Electrodes Modified with Carbon-Metal Hybrids Hybrids that combine carbon nanostructures (e.g., carbon nanofibers (CNFs), MWCNTs, and carbon quantum dots (CQDs)) with transition-metal nanoparticles (Fe, Co, Mn, etc.) are often used in electrocatalysis and sensing because they unite the high surface area, excellent electronic conductivity, and chemical robustness of the carbon scaffold with the redox/catalytic activity of the metal sites [ 77 The integration of these two classes of materials often yields hybrid electrodes with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity for Trp detection ( Table 5 4 Figure 4 47 4 Figure 4 MWCNT-based hybrids further demonstrate that synergistic interactions with metal oxides or dopants can alleviate the intrinsic drawbacks of CNTs, such as aggregation and limited selectivity [ 78 82 83 78 Magnetic carbon-metal hybrids, such as Fe 3 4 79 4.4. Trp-Sensing Electrodes Modified with Polymers Polymers, particularly conducting types like polyaniline, polypyrrole, and PEDOT:PSS, are integral to electrochemical sensor design due to their tunable conductivity, biocompatibility, and ease of functionalization [ 84 Their integration with carbon nanomaterials such as MWCNTs has been shown to enhance conductivity and stability, while molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) further introduce analyte-specific selectivity [ 84 85 Table 6 86 87 MIP-based architectures, while traditionally limited by poor conductivity, achieve higher analytical performance when combined with conductive supports such as MWCNTs. The success of MIPs arises from their ability to create molecular cavities that mimic the steric and electronic environment of Trp, as shown in Figure 5 51 89 Another promising avenue involves the integration of conducting polymers with functionalized carbon nanostructures. Poly(3,4-proplenedioxy thiophene) (PProDOT) is a derivative of a conducting polymer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) with improved processibility. Introducing certain functional groups such as –OH and –SH can improve sensor sensitivity due to bonding interactions such as hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking between the analyte and functional groups ( Figure 5 92 In addition, strategies that shift the electro-oxidation potential of Trp into less-congested windows are particularly impactful [ 88 97 4.5. Trp-Sensing Electrodes Modified with Other Materials Ionic liquids (ILs) and ionic liquid crystals (ILCs) offer a unique combination of ionic conductivity and ordered molecular orientation, making them promising modifiers in electrochemical sensor development [ 98 Table 7 A mechanistic examination of ILC-assisted electrodes suggests that their contribution extends beyond conductivity enhancement. The ionized moieties within ILCs enable facilitated ionic shuttling through conductive matrices such as rGO sheets, thereby reducing charge transfer resistance and lowering oxidation potential. This is particularly relevant for the electrooxidation of Trp, where proton-coupled electron transfer pathways are sensitive to local ionic mobility. Moreover, the anisotropic molecular ordering of ILCs promotes preferential orientation of nanostructures (such as CNTs or metal nanoparticles) at the electrode interface, which may further increase electroactive surface area and electron transfer kinetics. This synergy accounts for the higher oxidation currents and improved stability reported in ILC-modified systems [ 98 Another important consideration is the chemical environment modulated by IL. pH-dependent studies indicate that IL composites facilitate electrostatic interactions between the deprotonated carboxyl group of Trp and positively charged electrode interfaces, thereby reinforcing molecular recognition. This implies that ILCs not only enhance electron transfer, but also provide a favorable microenvironment for selective binding. The ability to integrate ILs with semiconducting oxides (e.g., SnO 2 3 4 99 100 Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the integration of MXenes and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into electrochemical sensors for Trp detection ( Table 8 102 103 104 105 102 By contrast, MOFs contribute to sensing platforms through their crystalline porous structures and chemically tailorable frameworks [ 106 107 Despite their promise, both MXenes and MOFs face practical challenges. MXenes are prone to oxidative degradation in aqueous or ambient conditions, potentially compromising long-term stability. MOFs, while highly tunable, can suffer from structural collapse or leaching of metal ions under physiological conditions. Moreover, the fabrication protocols (etching, solvothermal synthesis, in situ polymerization) can be complex and difficult to standardize, raising concerns about reproducibility across laboratories. 4.6. Tryp-Sensing Electrodes Modified Nanomaterials The electrochemical detection of Tryp remains less explored than that of Trp due to its low physiological abundance, high variability, and weaker oxidation signal. Trp, an essential amino acid and precursor of SR and melatonin, exhibits a strong and well-defined indole oxidation peak, making it reliably detectable on conventional electrodes. In contrast, Tryp requires highly sensitive, often nanomaterial-enhanced electrodes for detection. Its oxidation follows a quasi-reversible one-electron/one-proton mechanism, initiating at C 2 7 5 Table 9 35 108 109 Nevertheless, compared with the extensive advancements in Trp sensors, current Tryp-sensing technologies face several unresolved challenges. First, structural similarity to Trp and Tryp complicates selectivity, often requiring MIPs or enzymatic pathways to ensure discrimination [ 35 108 5 111 109 111 112 The relative scarcity of reports compared with Trp sensors reflects both the lower historical prioritization of Tryp in biomedical sensing and the greater analytical complexity arising from its oxidation pathway and interference profile. This discrepancy underscores the need for systematic research into (i) anti-fouling electrode materials (e.g., conductive polymers with redox mediators, antifouling coatings), (ii) biorecognition strategies beyond MIPs and enzymes (such as Apt- or MOF-based selective adsorption), and (iii) miniaturized POC devices capable of multiplexed detection of biogenic amines [ 5 35 108 109 111 113 5. Trp, Tryp, and Their Roles in Oral Pathophysiology The oral cavity reflects both local and systemic health, with Trp and its derivative, Tryp, playing pivotal roles in immune modulation, microbial homeostasis, and disease progression. Trp serves as a precursor to SR and melatonin, linking its metabolism to mood, circadian regulation, and inflammatory responses. The microbial and enzymatic conversion of Trp to bioactive compounds such as Tryp further influences oral and systemic physiology. Saliva provides a non-invasive matrix for monitoring these metabolites, offering insight into oral diseases, including periodontal disorders and oral cancers, as well as systemic conditions [ 114 115 5.1. Oral Pathophysiology In this section, we focus on how Trp and its derivatives mentioned earlier can be used to monitor oral pathophysiologies, from periodontal disease to various types of cancers. Here, we present some representative results to demonstrate the utility of Trp-related sensing and its associated disease linkages. In addition, we also discuss the important question of the temporal stability of the salivary microbiota in oral health. Periodontal Disease: Melatonin is synthesized from Trp via SR as a precursor. It is classified as an indoleamine, which means it contains an indole ring (from Trp) and an amine group. Therefore, monitoring melatonin can be a surrogate for Trp. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and is present in both saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). One study investigated the role of melatonin in periodontal health, focusing on its presence in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) [ 116 p p Periodontal Inflammation: Another study explored the interplay between periodontal inflammation and Trp metabolism via the Kyn pathway, emphasizing its local (salivary) and systemic effects [ 19 p Oral microbiota may contribute to this dysregulation. Microbial stimulation of IDO activity has been shown to enhance Trp metabolism, increasing Kyn levels in saliva [ 19 Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): A 2023 study by Yang et al. investigated salivary metabolic changes and oral microbiota composition in AD, with a focus on Trp metabolism [ 18 Prevotella intermedia Fusobacterium nucleatum Porphyromonas gingivalis Overall, the study highlights a disruption in Trp metabolism in AD saliva, likely driven by changes in oral microbial composition. These findings suggest that altered oral flora in AD may redirect Trp metabolism toward neuroprotective indoleamine synthesis (e.g., SR) rather than salivary excretion and bacterial degradation, potentially modulating AD progression. The study highlights saliva as a reservoir for AD biomarkers and underscores the role of oral microbiome-host metabolic crosstalk in neurodegenerative disease mechanisms. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC): Saliva is a promising non-invasive source of biomarkers for the early detection of OSCC, which accounts for over 90% of oral cancers and remains a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide [ 117 p 118 p 119 Porphyromonas gingivalis Breast Cancer: Salivary Trp levels are elevated in patients with breast cancer, correlating with tumor aggressiveness and malignancy, particularly in triple-negative and luminal B-like HER2-negative subtypes [ 114 Thyroid cancer: A study developed a robust ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) method to quantify salivary amino acids for early papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) diagnosis [ 120 p Temporal Stability of the Salivary Microbiota: Saliva is increasingly recognized as a valuable, non-invasive medium for detecting biomarkers associated with both oral and systemic health. Beyond oral diseases, salivary biomarkers have been linked to systemic conditions including breast and thyroid cancers. The clinical application of salivary diagnostics depends on understanding the stability of salivary components over time. Belstrøm et al. conducted a systematic study to assess whether the composition of the salivary microbiota in orally healthy individuals fluctuates over short time periods [ 121 Streptococcus Porphyromonas gingivalis Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 5.2. Electrochemical Sensing Systems in Oral Hygiene and Disease Monitoring Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as highly promising platforms for salivary diagnostics, offering non-invasive, rapid, and cost-effective detection of biomarkers associated with oral cancer and systemic health. Unlike invasive biopsies or costly imaging modalities, electrochemical sensing enables real-time molecular monitoring at the POC, particularly valuable in resource-limited settings. Of particular interest are sensors targeting salivary metabolites such as Trp and its derivatives (e.g., Tryp and melatonin). These molecules not only reflect metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion in malignancies, but also serve as accessible indicators for personalized oral healthcare. Recent developments demonstrate impressive analytical sensitivity; however, a critical comparison reveals both opportunities and persistent barriers to clinical translation. For example, the application of nicking endonuclease signal amplification (NESA) on TiO 2 122 123 Electrochemical biosensors are particularly impactful in targeting salivary metabolites such as Trp and its derivatives, which play roles in metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion in oral cancers. This metabolite-centered approach complements the detection of canonical biomarkers, including interleukins (e.g., interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), metabolites, and microRNAs, thereby expanding diagnostic capacity beyond single-marker strategies [ 124 125 126 126 Table 10 While the reported LODs rival or surpass ELISA, major barriers to translation include: (i) variability in salivary composition, requiring robust normalization strategies; (ii) sensor stability, particularly under continuous intraoral exposure; and (iii) limited validation in large, diverse populations. Looking ahead, integration with AI-driven calibration, multi-marker sensing, and scalable 3D-printed microfluidic devices could bridge the gap between laboratory prototypes and routine clinical screening, potentially transforming early oral cancer diagnostics [ 13 127 6. Challenges and Perspectives Electrochemical biosensors for Trp and its metabolite Tryp hold considerable promise for the non-invasive monitoring of physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and oral diseases. While recent innovations in materials science and device engineering have pushed detection limits to picomolar levels and enabled multi-analyte capabilities, translating these advances into reliable, clinical-grade diagnostics remains a formidable challenge. Below, we outline the key scientific, technical, and translational barriers, along with emerging solutions, toward realizing robust, real-time Trp/Tryp biosensing platforms. 6.1. Biochemical and Electrochemical Challenges of Trp/Tryp-Sensing Selectivity, Stability, and Electrode Durability: The electrochemical detection of Trp and Tryp remains inherently challenging due to their molecular structures and redox behaviors. Trp’s indole ring confers distinct electroactivity, but also predisposes the molecule to oxidative instability, particularly in acidic environments, where degradation by-products complicate signal interpretation and reduce reproducibility [ 20 98 Perspectives: Overcoming these challenges requires integrated, multi-pronged approaches that combine materials science and engineering, electrochemical innovation, and advanced data analytics. MIPs designed to bind indole derivatives or enzyme-modified electrodes with substrate specificity, provide promising routes to enhance molecular recognition and selectivity. On the signal analysis side, DPV coupled with multivariate statistical tools or machine learning-assisted signal deconvolution offers powerful strategies to resolve overlapping oxidation peaks, thereby improving interpretability [ 13 24 98 The clinical significance of Tryp remains relatively underexplored, highlighting the need for systematic studies that link sensing performance to diagnostic outcomes. Addressing long-term stability will be essential for translation into real-world applications. Promising antifouling approaches such as polyethylene glycol coatings, self-cleaning surface modifications, and electrode regeneration techniques, show potential, but require refinement to achieve reproducible, long-duration operation in biofluids [ 128 129 6.2. Sensing in Complex Biofluids: The Case of Saliva Saliva as a Complex Diagnostic Medium: Saliva is increasingly recognized as a valuable diagnostic fluid for non-invasive monitoring; however, it is also one of the most challenging matrices for biosensing. Unlike plasma, saliva is a heterogeneous medium with fluctuating physical and biochemical properties. Its rheological characteristics, strongly influenced by mucins and glycoproteins, alter viscosity and affect analyte diffusion [ 114 115 117 18 116 Clinical conditions such as periodontal disease further reshape the salivary biochemical profile, complicating biomarker interpretation. Collection methodology adds another layer of complexity: differences between unstimulated passive drooling, expectoration, and swab-based sampling can lead to significant variations in analyte concentration and integrity. Moreover, stimulated saliva often altered flow rates and composition compared to unstimulated samples, influencing reproducibility and diagnostic reliability. Perspectives: To mitigate these challenges, rigorous normalization protocols and standardized sampling strategies are essential. Harmonized protocols covering collection, storage, and preprocessing steps will be critical to ensure reproducibility across clinical studies [ 114 125 130 13 Validation across diverse populations with different dietary, lifestyle, and genetic backgrounds remains a priority. Furthermore, systematic investigations of different oral niches—tongue, buccal mucosa, and salivary gland ducts—may provide complementary biomarker sources to enhance diagnostic robustness. 6.3. Biomarker Validation and Clinical Relevance Emerging Biomarkers with Limited Validation and Clinical Standardization: The role of Trp and its metabolite Tryp as salivary biomarkers is still in its infancy. While Trp has received more attention, evidence linking Tryp to disease processes such as carcinogenesis and immune modulation via IDO activity remains largely associative rather than mechanistic [ 19 In particular, the observed correlations between Tryp and cancer remain preliminary and require further mechanistic clarification to establish true clinical relevance across both oral and systemic diseases. Furthermore, most candidate biomarkers for early detection have not yet been validated in large, demographically diverse cohorts. This gap emphasizes the need for reproducibility, meta-analyses, and standardized biomarker interpretation. Progress toward clinical translation will therefore require not only multi-institutional clinical studies, but also regulatory benchmarks, such as head-to-head comparisons with ELISA or other gold-standard assays, to objectively evaluate biosensor performance [ 10 Perspectives: Future progress hinges on addressing three interconnected challenges: validation, standardization, and regulatory alignment. First, biomarker validation will require large-scale, multi-center clinical trials involving >1000 patients to rigorously assess sensitivity, specificity, and performance in the presence of confounding conditions [ 131 Second, moving beyond single biomarkers, emerging multi-omics approaches, including proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, hold promise for developing robust biomarker panels with higher diagnostic accuracy [ 115 119 120 Finally, alignment with regulatory pathways remains a critical milestone. To date, no Trp/Tryp biosensor has advanced into formal pilot trials or regulatory submission processes such as ISO 13,485 certification or CE-marking [ 132 133 6.4. Sensor and Platform Engineering Barriers Durable and Scalable Sensors for Microfluidic and CMOS Integration: Although electrochemical sensors are inherently compatible with microfluidic and CMOS-based platforms, their seamless integration remains technically challenging. Issues such as flow rate inconsistencies, reagent cross-contamination, and thermal instability during processes, particularly when multiple sample preparation steps, including cell sorting, lysis, nucleic acid isolation, and amplification, must be incorporated within a single compact device [ 125 126 127 124 69 82 Perspectives: To facilitate integration, modular approaches can be adopted, such as 3D-printed microfluidic modules, pre-loaded reagent cartridges, and magnetic bead chambers, which simplify device assembly and enhance reproducibility [ 79 127 55 109 6.5. Simultaneous Multi-Analyte Detection Peak Overlap and Signal Interference: The simultaneous detection of multiple analytes such as Trp, Tryp, SR, Tyr, and other amino compounds is essential for capturing comprehensive biochemical profiles relevant to disease diagnostics [ 17 73 75 113 134 Perspectives: Several strategies have been developed to address this challenge: Electrode Architecture: Advanced electrode designs, such as multiplexed microelectrodes, nanostructured surfaces, and spatially resolved electrode arrays, enable the independent and parallel detection of multiple analytes. Incorporating recognition elements such as MIP layers or enzyme-specific coatings further enhances selectivity and reduces cross-talk between signals [ 24 38 Voltammetric Signal Deconvolution: Sophisticated electrochemical methods such as DPV, SWV, and EIS, when coupled with deconvolution algorithms, allow for the resolution of overlapping peaks and provide more accurate quantification [ 13 134 Computational Approaches: Machine learning-based signal separation has emerged as a powerful tool to handle complex electrochemical datasets. Algorithms such as principal component analysis, support vector machines, and deep learning models can classify and quantify analytes from overlapping voltammetric signals with high accuracy. These tools enable discrimination between structurally related compounds and allow for robust analysis in complex biofluids. Together, these advances highlight the feasibility of multiplexed sensing despite intrinsic biochemical challenges, paving the way for practical multi-analyte biosensors capable of real-world diagnostic use. 6.6. AI and Smart Biosensing Machine Learning for Enhanced Interpretation: AI and machine learning algorithms hold transformative potential for refining the accuracy and reliability of biosensor outputs [ 134 135 134 Despite these promising results, the performance of AI systems remains heavily dependent on the availability of high-quality, annotated datasets. Current limitations in dataset size, diversity, and metadata annotation hinder robust model training and generalization across different biosensor platforms and patient cohorts. To overcome these challenges, collaborative data-sharing consortia and standardized data acquisition protocols are urgently needed. Strategies such as transfer learning and federated learning also offer powerful means to leverage existing datasets across institutions while preserving data privacy and improving model generalization [ 136 Perspectives: Several strategic directions are recommended to fully harness AI in Trp/Tryp biosensing: High-Quality Dataset Development: Building open-access, annotated databases of electrochemical sensor responses across diverse populations, biological matrices, and disease states should be prioritized. Such databases will underpin robust and generalizable predictive modeling [ 134 Standardization of Protocols: Harmonized standards for sample preparation, sensor calibration, and data logging will improve reproducibility and enable interoperability across biosensor platforms. Feature Engineering and Multi-Omics Integration: Beyond raw voltammetric or amperometric data, AI models can incorporate engineered features (e.g., peak ratios, charge transfer kinetics, response times) along with contextual metadata (age, sex, circadian cycles). Integration with multi-omics datasets (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) will allow biosensors to capture a more holistic biomarker signature and improve disease prediction accuracy [ 136 Edge Computing and Real-Time Decision Support: Embedding lightweight AI algorithms into portable or wearable biosensors enables on-device signal processing with minimal latency and enhanced data privacy. Such approaches can enable the real-time monitoring of Trp/Tryp fluctuations, critical for continuous health tracking. Adaptive Self-Calibration: AI can dynamically adjust for baseline shifts, electrode degradation, and environmental variations, extending sensor lifespan and improving reliability in long-term applications. Explainable and Regulatory-Compliant AI: For clinical adoption, models must not only be accurate, but also interpretable. Explainable AI ensures that decision pathways are transparent, facilitating clinician trust and regulatory approval while minimizing risks of false positives or negatives. Secure Data Handling: Encryption and adherence to privacy standards are essential for safeguarding sensitive health data, maintaining user trust, and supporting integration into personalized healthcare ecosystems. In summary, while AI-augmented biosensing for Trp/Tryp remains at an early stage, initial demonstrations highlight substantial improvements in accuracy, robustness, and adaptability. With coordinated efforts in dataset generation, methodological standardization, and the integration of multi-omics and contextual information, AI has the potential to transform electrochemical Trp/Tryp biosensors into powerful, clinically relevant tools for real-time biochemical monitoring. 6.7. Toward POC and Home-Based Monitoring Accessible Real-Time Personalized Health Tracking: Emerging trends in real-time, personalized health monitoring include the development of smartphone-compatible sensors, screen-printed electrochemical platforms, and wearable biosensors capable of continuous, at-home data acquisition. Integration with Bluetooth connectivity, cloud computing, and AI-driven applications has the potential to transform chronic disease management and facilitate early detection of oral potentially malignant disorders [ 134 136 Perspectives: Addressing challenges in POC and home-based monitoring requires a multi-pronged strategy. Fully integrated, disposable LOC systems should combine sample handling, filtration, mixing, detection, and waste management within a single device [ 126 7. Conclusions Over the past decade, the electrochemical sensing of Trp and its key metabolite Tryp has advanced significantly, driven by innovations in electrode materials, nanostructures, and surface engineering. Carbon-based platforms, including CNTs, Gr derivatives, and hybrid nanocomposites, have played a central role in lowering detection limits while simultaneously improving sensor stability, reproducibility, and operational lifetime. These advances have enabled the reliable monitoring of indole-derived biomarkers in complex biological matrices such as saliva, serum, and urine, positioning electrochemical biosensors as practical tools for real-time molecular diagnostics. Despite these technical achievements, several translational challenges remain. The structural similarity of Trp and Tryp to other aromatic metabolites continues to challenge selectivity, and matrix effects from saliva or serum can further complicate accurate quantification. Variability in biofluid composition due to circadian rhythms, dietary intake, or individual physiology necessitates robust normalization strategies. Additionally, standardized validation protocols are lacking, and most studies are confined to proof-of-concept demonstrations under controlled laboratory conditions, with limited assessment in real-world patient cohorts. Looking ahead, the next generation of biosensors must move beyond single-analyte detection to develop multiplexed, pathology-specific platforms capable of simultaneously monitoring Trp, Tryp, and downstream metabolites such as SR, melatonin, and Kyn. Such multi-parametric sensing approaches would enable a systems-level understanding of metabolic and neurochemical networks, providing valuable insights for precision diagnostics in oncology, psychiatry, and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the convergence of advanced nanomaterials, bioengineering strategies, and digital health technologies is expected to transition Trp- and Tryp-based sensing from experimental prototypes into clinically actionable tools, a transformation that will require not only continued materials innovation, but also rigorous clinical validation, scalable and reproducible manufacturing, and interdisciplinary collaboration across chemistry, engineering, and medicine. Ultimately, addressing these challenges holds the potential to redefine molecular health monitoring, facilitating early disease intervention, personalized therapy, and broader global healthcare accessibility; in summary, while significant progress has been made, realizing the full translational potential of Trp and Tryp biosensors will demand coordinated efforts spanning technological, biological, and clinical domains.
