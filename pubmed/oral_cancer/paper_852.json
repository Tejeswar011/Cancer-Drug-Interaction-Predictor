Introduction At the time of diagnosis, individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have typically lost approximately 50% of their β-cell secretory capacity, with subsequent annual declines ranging from about 2% in older adults to as high as 40% in younger patients or those with rapidly progressive disease [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Selecting appropriate non-insulin hypoglycemic agents to complement insulin therapy is therefore crucial for optimizing both glycemic control and long-term outcomes [ 13 13 14 15 16 10 17 18 19 Despite these recognized benefits, evidence regarding the long-term cardiovascular and microvascular effects of adding GLP-1 RAs to insulin therapy remains limited [ 10 11 2. Results 2.1. Study Subjects From the NHIRD, a total of 893,990 patients with T2D receiving insulin therapy were initially identified. After applying exclusion criteria and propensity score matching, 6779 matched pairs of GLP-1 RA users versus DPP-4 inhibitor users and 5242 matched pairs of GLP-1 RA users versus sulfonylurea users were obtained ( Figures S1 and S2 Table 1 Table S1 2.2. Key Findings 2.2.1. GLP-1 RA Versus DPP-4 Inhibitor Use In the propensity score-matched cohort comparing GLP-1 RAs with DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 RA treatment was significantly associated with a lower risk of MACE [aHR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46–0.58; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.49–0.61, corresponding to a 46% risk reduction], as well as hospitalizations for coronary artery disease (aHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54–0.75), stroke (aHR 0.48, 95% CI 0.40–0.56), and heart failure (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.25–0.42). GLP-1 RA use was also associated with reduced risks of major microvascular complications [aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.35–0.50; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33–0.47, a 61% reduction], end-stage kidney disease (aHR 0.08, 95% CI 0.04–0.14), sight-threatening retinopathy (aHR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50–0.76), leg amputation (aHR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05–0.57), and all-cause mortality (aHR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32–0.44) ( Table 2 p Figure 1 Figures S3 and S4 Table S2 2.2.2. GLP-1 RA Versus Sulfonylurea Use In the matched cohort comparing GLP-1 RAs with sulfonylureas, GLP-1 RA treatment was significantly associated with reduced risks of MACE (aHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.58–0.75), hospitalization for coronary artery disease (aHR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61–0.88), stroke (aHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54–0.76), heart failure (aHR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42–0.70), major microvascular complications (aHR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56–0.82), end-stage kidney disease (aHR 0.39, 95% CI 0.27–0.57), leg amputation (aHR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09–0.91), and all-cause mortality (aHR 0.46, 95% CI 0.39–0.54). By contrast, the reduction in sight-threatening retinopathy risk did not reach statistical significance (aHR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67–1.08) ( Table 3 p p p p p p p Figure 2 Figures S5 and S6 2.3. Subgroup Analyses 2.3.1. GLP-1 RA Versus DPP-4 Inhibitor Use Across multiple subgroups, GLP-1 RA use was consistently associated with reduced risks of hospitalization for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, end-stage kidney disease, sight-threatening retinopathy, and all-cause mortality compared with DPP-4 inhibitor use ( Tables S3–S8 2.3.2. GLP-1 RA Versus Sulfonylurea Use In subgroup analyses, GLP-1 RA therapy was generally associated with lower risks of hospitalization for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, ESKD, and all-cause mortality compared with sulfonylurea use ( Tables S9–S13 3. Discussion This nationwide cohort study in Taiwan demonstrated that, among patients with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin therapy, the addition of GLP-1 RAs was associated with reduced risks of MACE, hospitalizations for stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure, as well as major microvascular complications, end-stage kidney disease, sight-threatening retinopathy, leg amputation, and all-cause mortality, compared with the addition of DPP-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas. Long-term follow-up from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) suggested that intensive glycemic control with insulin may reduce the risk of myocardial infarction [ 6 7 13 14 18 20 19 T2D is also associated with an increased risk, severity, and recurrence of stroke [ 21 20 21 15 Compared with individuals without T2D, patients with T2D have a two- to four-fold higher prevalence of heart failure (HF) [ 22 23 14 17 10 20 Randomized controlled trials have shown that intensive insulin therapy reduces microvascular complications, particularly diabetic kidney disease [ 6 7 8 22 19 24 Earlier studies suggested that insulin therapy may increase the risk of diabetic retinopathy, possibly due to rapid glucose lowering [ 25 26 27 Patients on insulin therapy often have poorer glycemic control and a higher burden of complications [ 14 17 28 29 Our previous research demonstrated that the combination of DPP-4 inhibitors with insulin was associated with reduced mortality risk in insulin-treated patients with T2D [ 30 19 10 11 The mechanisms underlying the protective effects of GLP-1 RAs against macrovascular and microvascular complications in T2D are likely multifactorial: (i) promotion of weight loss, reduction in systolic blood pressure, and improvement in lipid levels—key cardiovascular risk factors [ 17 20 21 31 11 31 31 3.1. Perspectives for Clinical Practice Our findings indicate that, among patients with T2D receiving insulin therapy, the addition of GLP-1 RAs may confer substantial long-term benefits compared with DPP-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas. GLP-1 RA use was associated with significant reductions in major cardiovascular events, critical microvascular complications (including kidney failure, sight-threatening retinopathy, and amputation), and all-cause mortality. These results underscore the role of GLP-1 RAs not only as effective glucose-lowering agents but also as therapies that improve prognosis and reduce overall disease burden. In practice, GLP-1 RAs may be particularly advantageous for insulin-treated patients with elevated cardiovascular or microvascular risk. When clinically appropriate, they can be combined with metformin or SGLT2 inhibitors to further enhance cardiometabolic protection. Careful monitoring for adverse events is essential, and practical considerations such as treatment cost and accessibility should be taken into account to support equitable and effective implementation. 3.2. Limitations This study has several limitations. First, the NHIRD lacks information on family history, physical activity, and dietary habits. Clinical data such as blood cholesterol, glucose levels, hemoglobin A1C, renal function, and inflammatory biomarkers are also unavailable. To mitigate these limitations, we used propensity score matching to balance important covariates between groups, including the DCSI, CCI, use of oral antidiabetic drugs, and diabetes duration, which may serve as proxies for disease severity. Second, medication adherence, including prescribed insulin doses, could not be reliably assessed from claims data. We also did not analyze hypoglycemia events, as outpatient hypoglycemia is often underreported in the database. Third, the study was conducted primarily in a Taiwanese population, which may limit generalizability to other ethnic groups. Finally, as with any cohort study, residual confounding and unmeasured biases cannot be excluded, and causal inference remains limited. Further confirmation from randomized controlled trials is warranted. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Study Population and Data Source This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which covers nearly 99% of the national population. The database contains comprehensive healthcare information, including demographics, clinical diagnoses, medical procedures, and prescription records [ 32 This study was designed and reported in accordance with the STROBE guidelines and checklist [ 33 4.2. Study Design and Procedures Patients with T2D were identified in the NHIRD between 1 January 2008, and 31 December 2021 ( Figure S1 Table S14 34 34 Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age < 20 or >100 years; (2) missing data on age or sex; (3) history of type 1 diabetes, dialysis, sight-threatening retinopathy (defined as ≥2 outpatient visits or ≥1 hospitalization with surgical intervention, laser photocoagulation within 90 days of diagnosis, vision loss, or anti-VEGF injection), or leg amputation before the index date; (4) use of GLP-1 RAs or DPP-4 inhibitors within 3 months before insulin initiation; (5) concurrent use of GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors; and (6) not receiving either of these agents. Patients who initiated GLP-1 RAs after their T2D diagnosis were classified as GLP-1 RA users, while those who began DPP-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas were categorized accordingly. The index date for each patient was defined as the date of initiating the respective medication. Since GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors became available in Taiwan only after 2011, the index date for all groups was set on or after 1 January 2011. Patients were followed from the index date until 31 December 2021. 4.3. Demographics and Related Variables of the Participants We adjusted for a range of clinically relevant variables that could influence the likelihood of receiving GLP-1 RA therapy and thereby affect outcomes ( Table 1 Table S1 Medication use was also considered, including the number and classes of oral antidiabetic agents, antihypertensives, aspirin, and statins. In addition, we included the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) [ 35 36 4.4. Main Outcomes The primary outcomes were: (1) major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as a composite of hospitalizations for coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and heart failure, and (2) major microvascular complications, defined as a composite of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), sight-threatening retinopathy, and leg amputation [ 34 4.5. Statistical Analysis To ensure comparability between GLP-1 RA users and non-users, we performed 1:1 propensity score matching. Propensity scores were estimated using a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model, with GLP-1 RA initiation as the dependent variable. Covariates included demographic characteristics (age, sex), smoking status, obesity, comorbidities, CCI and DCSI scores (≤1 vs. >1), index year, medication use, and duration of T2D ( Table 1 Table S1 t p Outcomes were compared between GLP-1 RA users and DPP-4 inhibitor/sulfonylurea users using Cox proportional hazards models with robust sandwich variance estimators. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. Results are expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cumulative incidence of outcomes was estimated using Kaplan–Meier curves and compared with log-rank tests. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess effect modification by sex, age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, CCI, DCSI, number of oral antidiabetic agents, statin use, and diabetes duration. A sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding SGLT2 inhibitor users from the GLP-1 RA and DPP-4 inhibitor cohorts to confirm that the observed benefits of GLP-1 RAs were not attributable to concomitant SGLT2 inhibition. A two-sided p 5. Conclusions In this nationwide cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin therapy, the addition of GLP-1 RAs was associated with significantly lower risks of cardiovascular events, major microvascular complications, and all-cause mortality compared with the addition of DPP-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas. These findings suggest that incorporating GLP-1 RAs into insulin regimens may help optimize treatment, reduce disease burden, and improve survival. Nevertheless, as this was an observational study, the possibility of residual confounding must be acknowledged, and the generalizability of our findings beyond the Taiwanese healthcare setting may be limited. Further randomized controlled trials and investigations in more diverse populations are warranted to confirm these benefits and inform clinical practice.
