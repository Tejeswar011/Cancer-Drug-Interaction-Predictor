Introduction Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a metabolic-psychiatric disease [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 7 8 9 10 Although the pathophysiological role of genetics in AN is increasingly becoming evident [ 2 For a long time, clinical endocrinology has defined the existence of a “metabolic” component in AN, but only recently, studies in the field of biological psychiatry have demonstrated the association between metabolic vs. psychiatric components in AN. In this context, genome-wide studies have identified a series of gene loci 2 11 2 11 12 12 Lipidomics, including sphingolipidomics, is emerging as a valuable analytical methodology, applicable on a large scale, for studying a vast number of lipid classes and single lipid compounds, which act as metabolites of biochemical pathways within the cell or subcellular structures [ 13 14 15 16 Parallelly, dyslipidemia, defined in clinical practice as “generic” alteration of lipid metabolism, has been associated with a series of diseases, including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic inflammation, and cancer [ 17 18 19 The lipidomics, including sphingolipidomics, possesses, when compared to standard clinical biochemistry, the potential of characterizing the lipid and, specifically, sphingolipid profile in a patient with AN [ 20 Recently, in a population of female adolescents with AN, Tam et al. [ 20 20 21 Thus, based on the previous considerations, the primary endpoint of the present study was to determine the sphingolipidomic profile in women with AN compared to a normal-weight healthy (NWH) group. Secondarily, given the existence of different sphingolipidomic profiles between AN and NWH groups, we evaluated associations of the sphingolipid profile with demographic, biochemical, and clinical parameters. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. General Information A cross-sectional design was employed in the present study to determine plasma sphingolipidomics in AN and to assess the associations between plasma levels of individual sphingolipids (or sphingolipid classes) and demographic, biochemical, and clinical parameters. 2.2. Subjects The present study included 28 women with AN: 25 patients were amenorrheic, 1 had normal menses, and 2 were under oral contraceptive therapy. Participants were consecutively recruited at the Division of Eating and Nutrition Disorders at Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS, Piancavallo-Verbania, a tertiary care centre specialised in the multidisciplinary (metabolic, nutritional, and psychological) rehabilitation of severe obesity and eating disorders in Northern Italy. Participants were eligible for the study if they were female (due to the higher prevalence of eating disorders in women compared to men [ 22 23 Participants included in the study were at their first admission to our centre, with a previous history of only outpatient visits. Patients with AN underwent a multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation treatment in a residential setting for three to eight weeks, as previously described [ 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 NWH female controls (n = 30) were recruited from the hospital’s medical, research, and administrative staff, as well as among friends and colleagues. The control group excluded persons with representative disorders, such as psychiatric disorders. Convenience sampling was utilized due to its practicality in accessing readily available populations. Although this approach inherently limits generalizability, efforts were, however, made to mitigate these limitations by targeting subjects of the same educational and social status. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee no. 5, Lombardy Region (registration number: 209/24; date of approval: 23 April 2024; research order code: 01C417, acronym: SFINGOANNER). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and its subsequent amendments, or with comparable ethical standards. 2.3. Anthropometric Measurements A scale with a stadiometer was used to determine height and weight (Wunder Sa.Bi., WU150, Trezzo sull’Adda, Italy). Body composition was measured by bioimpedance analysis (Human-IM Scan, DS-Medigroup, Milan, Italy) after 20 min of supine rest. BMI, fat mass (FM), and fat-free mass (FFM) were determined in all subjects. 2.4. REE Measurement Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. in thermoneutral conditions (room temperature: 22–25 °C) using an open-circuit, indirect, computerized calorimeter equipped with a canopy (Vmax 29, Sensor Medics, Yorba Linda, CA, USA). The calorimeter underwent periodic quality control tests to ensure the reliability of the measurements. The gas analyzers were calibrated before each test using a reference gas mixture of 15% O 2 2 31 2 2 2 2 32 2.5. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Blood pressure was measured on the right arm using a sphygmomanometer with an appropriately sized cuff, with the subject in a seated position and in a relaxed condition. The procedure was repeated three times at 10 min intervals; the means of the three values for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were recorded. Heat rate (HR) was measured using both manual and electronic methods on two separate occasions. 2.6. Metabolic Variables Blood samples (about 10 mL) were collected at around 8:00 a.m. after an overnight fast (about 12 h) on the third day post-admission to the hospital, before starting the intervention of metabolic rehabilitation. Total cholesterol (T-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Colorimetric enzymatic assays (Roche Diagnostics, Monza, Italy) were used to determine serum T-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG levels. The sensitivities of the assays were 3.86 mg/dL (1 mg/dL = 0.03 mmol/L), 3.87 mg/dL (1 mg/dL = 0.03 mmol/L), 3.09 mg/dL (1 mg/dL = 0.03 mmol/L), and 8.85 mg/dL (1 mg/dL = 0.01 mmol/L), respectively. Serum glucose levels were measured using the glucose oxidase enzymatic method (Roche Diagnostics, Monza, Italy). The sensitivity of the method was 2 mg/dL (1 mg/dL = 0.06 mmol/L). Serum insulin concentration was determined using a chemiluminescent immunoassay with a commercial kit (Elecsys Insulin, Roche Diagnostics, Monza, Italy). The sensitivity of the method was 0.2 µIU/mL (1 µU/mL = 7.18 pmol/L). CRP was measured using an immunoturbidimetric assay (CRP RX, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The sensitivity of the method was 0.03 mg/dL. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were the following: 1.1% and 1.6% for T-C, 1.2% and 2.5% for LDL-C, 1.8% and 2.2% for HDL-C, 1.1% and 2.0% for TG, 1.0% and 1.3% for glucose, and 1.5% and 4.9% for insulin. For each patient, we also calculated the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) according to the following formula: (insulin (μIU/mL] × glucose (mmol/L))/22.5. 2.7. Lipid Extraction from Plasma and Sphingolipid Target Analysis by LC-MS/MS Sphingolipids extraction and targeted LC–MS/MS analysis were performed as previously described [ 33 34 35 v v 35 2 2.8. Statistics Sigma Stat 4.0 (SysStat Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) and GraphPad PRISM 7.0a (La Jolla, CA, USA) were used for analyses and plotting. Parameters were expressed as median (interquartile range) and analyzed by Mann–Whitney Rank Sum Test (AN vs. NWH). Categorical variables were compared through chi-square or Fisher tests. Spearman’s correlation was used to calculate the correlation of single sphingolipids or sphingolipid classes with demographic, biochemical, and clinical parameters. A heat map representation was used to show, in a colour-coded system, the correlation coefficients and the corresponding p A p 3. Results 3.1. Demographic, Biochemical, and Clinical Parameters Table 1 In brief, age, weight, BMI, FFM (kg), and FM (%) were significantly lower in women with AN compared to the NWH group. Despite the similar HR, women with AN exhibited lower values of both SBP and DBP than the NWH group. When considering the glucometabolic homeostasis, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR were significantly lower in women with AN than in the NWH group, with similar values for HbA1 c 3.2. Sphingolipidomic Profile Table 2 In total, among single sphingolipidis and sphingolipid classes, 22 comparisons between the AN and NWH groups were significant. In particular, plasma levels of Cer 20:0, Cer 24:1, DHCer 24:1, SM 16:0, SM 24:0, SM 24:1, total SM, HexCer 24:1, LacCer 18:1, LacCer 24:0, LacCer 24:1, GM3 16:0, GM3 20:0, GM3 24:0, GM3 24:1, and DHS1P were significantly higher in women with AN than NWH group; on the contrary, plasma levels of Cer 22:0, DHCer 18:1, LacCer 18:0, GM3 18:1, total LacCer, and DHSph were significantly lower in women with AN than NWH group. 3.3. Correlations of Sphingolipids with Other Parameters Demographic, biochemical, and clinical parameters were subdivided into four macro-groups related to the following: body composition; cardiovascular function; glucometabolic homeostasis; and (standard) lipid profiles. Single sphingolipids and sphingolipid classes, which were significantly different when comparing AN and NWH groups (see above), were correlated with these parameters. The results are summarized in Tables S1–S4 Supplementary Material To facilitate the interpretation of correlations, panels A and B of Figure 1 4. Discussion In the present study, carried out in a group of young women with AN, hospitalized for a multidisciplinary program of metabolic rehabilitation, compared to an NWH group, a plasma sphingolipidomic approach was adopted, and twenty-two sphingolipid compounds and classes were found to be different between AN and NWH groups: in particular, plasma levels of Cer 20:0, Cer 24:1, DHCer 24:1, SM 16:0, SM 24:0, SM 24:1, total SM, HexCer 24:1, LacCer 18:1, LacCer 24:0, LacCer 24:1, GM3 16:0, GM3 20:0, GM3 24:0, GM3 24:1, and DHS1P were higher in women with AN than NWH group; on the contrary, plasma levels of Cer 22:0, DHCer 18:1, LacCer 18:0, GM3 18:1, total LacCer, and DHSph were lower in women with AN than NWH group. Furthermore, the sphingolipidomic profile was correlated with demographic, biochemical, and clinical parameters, which were clustered in four groups: parameters related to body composition, cardiovascular function, glucometabolic homeostasis, and (standard) lipid metabolism. The statistically different sphingolipid compounds and classes, as listed above, were mainly correlated with parameters related to body composition. Body composition, specifically BMI, FM, and FFM, is recognized to influence sphingolipid metabolism and circulating levels. Increased BMI and FM, often associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, are linked to elevated levels of some sphingolipids, particularly Cers, both in adipose tissue and plasma, potentially contributing to high cardiometabolic risk in these patients [ 36 37 At the molecular level, sphingolipids play crucial roles in cell signalling, membrane structure, and inflammation, all of which are influenced by body composition [ 14 15 16 For instance, fatty acids, released from adipose tissue due to activation of lipolysis, are needed to synthesize Cers and other sphingolipids via the so-called de novo pathway (see below). Moreover, inflammation associated with obesity has also been demonstrated to stimulate sphingolipid synthesis [ 38 Different from obesity, AN in females is characterized by fat loss in absolute terms, with fat redistribution, including a preferred decrease in extremity fat (i.e., subcutaneous white adipose tissue), and a paradoxical increase in trunk fat (i.e., visceral white adipose tissue) in percentage terms [ 39 40 41 In the present study, though body composition, particularly FM, was grossly measured by the bioimpedance method without discriminating visceral vs. subcutaneous compartments, FM was dramatically reduced in women with AN compared to the NWH group. As adipose tissue represents one of the most relevant sources of synthesis and release of sphingolipids into the plasma [ 42 43 Similar considerations may be extended to muscle tissue, another organ involved in the synthesis, release, and storage of sphingolipids [ 44 45 If fat redistribution and muscle shrinkage are mainly due to the underlying eating disorder (e.g., extremely limited energy intake and ensuing starvation) [ 40 39 For instance, AN is fundamentally characterized by high plasma levels of ghrelin and growth hormone (GH), together with GH resistance, normal–low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and hypoinsulinemia [ 46 47 48 49 50 51 39 AN-related endocrine disruption encompasses other hormones, which regulate lipid and, presumably, sphingolipid metabolism. For example, circulating levels of leptin, an adipocyte-derived anorexigenic peptide, are reduced in AN [ 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 Under conditions of starvation, such as AN, increased corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) hypothalamic expression promotes the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary [ 59 60 Notably, elevated cortisol suppresses the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary [ 61 62 55 Typically, AN is defined as chronic starvation without inflammation. Patients with AN appear to have lower CRP levels [ 63 64 65 Although body composition is strictly related to glucometabolic homeostasis, herein, we have focused on the relationship between body composition and sphingolipids. Our results reveal several correlations between specific sphingolipids and parameters related to glucometabolic homeostasis, including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR. Disruption of glucometabolic homeostasis in AN is considered a counter-regulatory response to the condition of starvation, characterized by dramatic changes in body composition, such as BMI [ 53 primum movens 66 Similar considerations apply to interpreting the correlations we found between certain sphingolipids and parameters related to cardiovascular function [ 67 Some Authors have postulated that the lipidomic profile in AN, which is similar to that in obesity and metabolic syndrome, is the deleterious consequence of the refeeding, which represents a part of the rehabilitative program administered to hospitalized patients with AN [ 20 The potential clinical implications of our results are significant: in fact, the herein identified sphingolipidomic profile (or even one specific sphingolipid) might serve as a biochemical marker for monitoring treatment effectiveness and/or achieving (if possible) recovery from the disease. At the molecular level, the length of the acyl group in Cers is primarily determined by the substrate specificity of different ceramide synthase (CerS) enzymes. Mammals have six CerS enzymes (CerS1–6), each preferentially utilizing acyl-CoA molecules with specific fatty acid chain lengths [ 68 69 In the present study, increased plasma levels of long-chain-fatty-acid-acyl-containing sphingolipids, precisely HexCer 24:0, LacCer 24:0, LacCer 24:1, GM3 24:0, GM3 24:1, SM 24:0, and SM 24:1, were observed with congruently increased plasma levels of Cer 24:1, which, as substrate, is used for the synthesis of the other so-reported sphingolipids. This biochemical pathway might be related to an increased availability of very long-chain fatty acids in AN. In this context, in a study, after a short-term rehabilitative treatment, plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids (i.e., C22:0 and C24:0) remained high in patients with AN relative to the control group, suggesting a potential biochemical marker to monitor the nutritional status in this disease [ 70 Similarly, DHCer 24:1 (increased in AN) might be formed through the N-acylation of DHSph (decreased in AN) by CerS2 using acyl-CoAs of very long chain length, such as C24:1 (presumably, increased in AN) [ 68 Before closing, some strengths and limitations of our manuscript should be mentioned. Regarding the strengths, the topic is novel, as it involves sphingolipidomic profiling in the context of AN, which is rare. Our results, though preliminary, will contribute to understanding the interaction between lipid metabolism and the pathophysiology of AN. Furthermore, we employed an advanced methodology that enables the quantitative analysis of multiple sphingolipid species, thereby strengthening the reliability of our results. Regarding limitations, the relatively small sample size might have limited statistical power, and this might impede us from generalizing results to the entire population. Carrying out the study exclusively in women significantly limits the applicability of the results to the broader AN population. In this regard, contemporary epidemiological data indicate rising incidence rates among boys and men [ 6 The lack of a prospective experimental design and longitudinal data prevents an assessment of the dynamics of sphingolipidomic changes during therapy or recovery. Indeed, our future intention is to reproduce the same protocol by adopting a prospective experimental design. Finally, in the present study, body composition was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance, a methodology that does not permit the estimation of body distribution of adipose tissue, including the distinction between visceral and subcutaneous compartments. Nevertheless, our argumentation regarding the role of adipose tissue in sphingolipidomics in AN, supported by evidence from the biomedical literature [ 39 40 5. Conclusions When considering the female population, a specific sphingolipidomic profile characterizes AN when compared to the NWH group. AN-related body composition, particularly fat loss and redistribution, as well as the ensuing endocrine disruption, may be the mechanisms underlying alterations in sphingolipid metabolism. Though the relationship between dyslipidemia and AN needs further investigation, sphingolipidomics might represent a biochemical approach for monitoring therapeutic success and clinical status in AN.
