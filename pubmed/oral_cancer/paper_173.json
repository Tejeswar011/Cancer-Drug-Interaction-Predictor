Background Radiation-induced skin injury is a significant concern in nuclear accidents and cancer radiotherapy (RT). Skin damage ranges from mild erythema to severe ulceration, which significantly affects the patients’ quality of life. While previous studies have highlighted the role of the apoptotic pathway, its precise mechanism in radiation-induced skin damage remains unclear. Method First, single-cell RNA and RNA-seq datasets were searched using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and further subgroup analysis of fibroblast skin cells, pseudotime analysis, and cell-cell communication analysis were conducted to determine the important state during fibroblast differentiation. Next, we analyzed and screened the key genes in the RNA-seq data. Finally, we performed SA-β-gal staining, flow cytometry, and qRT-PCR in an in vitro Result The apoptotic pathway plays a crucial role in fibroblasts. Subsequent analysis of fibroblast subtypes revealed different subtypes, including MMP3, Coch, Apod, and Eif4e. Enrichment analysis further demonstrated a significant upregulation of apoptosis in MMP3 fibroblasts (FIB). Pseudotime analysis indicated that MMP3 FIB exhibited high stemness within the fibroblast differentiation trajectory, while intercellular communication analysis underscored the critical role of TGF-β in fibroblast subtype interactions. Additionally, RNA-Seq analysis identified TGFBR2 as a key gene. In vitro Conclusion This study integrates single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses to reveal apoptosis-sensitive fibroblast subtypes involved in radiation-induced skin injury.

Radiation-induced skin injury occurs in approximately 95% of patients undergoing radiotherapy and ranges in severity from mild erythema to moist desquamation and ulceration. Some patients develop severe radiation dermatitis, which progresses to chronic radiation-induced skin injury, significantly affecting their quality of life ( 1 3 4 6 4 7 10 Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is of great importance for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing abnormal cell proliferation ( 11 13 14 16 With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics algorithms, advanced techniques, such as single-cell data analysis, transcriptome data analysis, and molecular docking, have been widely applied in biomedical research. In the study of radiation-induced skin injury and fibroblast apoptosis, these techniques provide powerful support for the in-depth analysis of cellular heterogeneity, gene expression regulatory networks, and drug target discovery. Single-cell data analysis can reveal heterogeneous changes in fibroblasts during radiation-induced skin injuries. Transcriptome data analysis enables the comprehensive elucidation of gene expression profile changes in fibroblasts during apoptosis. Molecular docking aids in predicting and validating potential drug targets and their interactions with proteins involved in fibroblast apoptosis. Therefore, this study focuses on the current application status and development trends of these techniques in the research of radiation-induced skin injury and fibroblast apoptosis, aiming to provide new ideas and methods for future research. Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II (TGFBR2), a key mediator in the TGF-β signaling pathway, plays a central role not only in fibrogenesis but also in regulating immune homeostasis and immune evasion in various pathological contexts ( 17 18 19 This study is the first to use multi-species data to explore TGFBR2 expression in fibroblasts from patients with post-radiation skin injury. The results suggest that TGFBR2 is a key gene in post-radiation skin injury, increasing the likelihood of our findings. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data collection and processing Single-cell RNA data ( GSE201447 GSE193564 GSE193807 20 21 GSE147733 22 GSE154559 GSE154599 23 2.2 Single-cell RNA data analysis The single-cell RNA data were analyzed using the “Seurat” package and visualization was performed by using “ggplot2,” “SCP,” “Nebulosa,” “scCustomize,” and “ggsci” R packages. Quality control retained cells with less than 5% mitochondrial genes, more than 200 genes, and genes expressed in at least 3 cells. The dataset was normalized using “LogNormalize’.” From each sample, 2,000 highly variable genes were selected for downstream analyses. Data integration and batch correction were performed using the “Harmony” R package ( 24 25 2.3 Cell-cell communication analysis The “CellChat” R package was used to explore potential differences in cell–cell interactions between experimental and control skin samples following the official workflow. This tool simulates cell-cell communication by evaluating ligand-receptor pairs and their respective cofactors. Inferences regarding interactions between two cell types are based on the expression of receptors in one type and ligands in the other ( 26 2.4 Functional enrichment analysis The “irGSEA” package was used to score the two groups using the “UCell” and “AUCell” enrichment methods, respectively. A heatmap of the differentially enriched pathways between the two groups was generated. Subsequently, the “PercentageFeatureSet” function was used to import apoptosis-related genes and obtain the percentage of apoptosis-related genes in each cell ( 27 29 2.5 Screening of core cells and functional enrichment analysis of their marker genes To further clarify the role of fibroblasts in radiation-induced skin damage, the “FindAllMarkers” function in the “Seurat” package was utilized. Parameters were set as min.pct = 0.2 and only.pos = TRUE to identify marker genes for each cluster. The “MAST” algorithm was employed to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the process of selecting marker genes. The R package “clusterProfiler” was used to enrich the marker genes of core cells, achieving GO and KEGG functional annotations ( 30 2.6 Pseudotime analysis Cell stemness was assessed using the “CytoTRACE” R package to determine the temporal order of cell differentiation. The “Monocle” R package was used to analyze the pseudotime trajectory of tumor cells. Dimensionality reduction was achieved using the UMAP method, followed by the sorting of different cell subpopulations based on their pseudotime order. Pseudotime heatmaps were used to identify and represent genes that exhibit synchronous changes along the pseudotime trajectory ( 31 32 2.7 Machine learning for key gene selection To further investigate gene interactions and functions, the STRING database was used to analyze and visualize gene interactions. The machine learning algorithm, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), was constructed using the “caret” R package. 2.8 Cell culture and irradiation HSF cells (human skin fibroblast used in in vitro 2.9 Senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining HSF from both the control and IR groups were cultured for three days following radiation exposure. Subsequently, the cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed in fixative solution at room temperature for 15 min, and washed three times with PBS. The cells were then incubated overnight at 37 °C in freshly prepared β-galactosidase Staining Solution (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Imaging was performed using an optical microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with senescent cells exhibiting blue staining in the cytoplasm. 2.10 Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Optical density was used to determine the concentration and purity of RNA. An M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Accurate Biology, Changsha, China) was used to synthesize cDNA. SYBR Green (Accurate Biology, Changsha, China) was used to perform Real-time PCR amplification, and the relative mRNA expression was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method and normalized to β-Actin expression. The study included n=3. Data are presented as the mean ± SD by paired two-tailed Student’s t-test, ***p < 0.001. TGFBR2 Human qPCR Primer Pair show as follows: Forward Sequence: GTCTGTGGATGACCTGGCTAAC. Reverse Sequence: GACATCGGTCTGCTTGAAGGAC. 2.11 Apoptosis analysis HSF were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 10 5 2.12 Molecular docking Based on literature review, TGFBR2 was selected as the receptor protein, and “Berberine” and “Salidroside” were chosen as ligand small molecules. The receptor protein was imported into PyMOL 2.6.0 for dehydration. AutoDockTools 1.5.7 was used to connect, hydrogenate, and non-polarize the hydrogens, and then convert the protein to pdbqt format. The Grid function in AutoDockTools 1.5.7 was used to identify the binding regions of the protein receptor, that is, the active site. Small ligand molecules in mol2 format were imported into AutoDockTools for hydrogenation and charge calculation settings. Based on the docking pocket obtained from the previous step and the processed receptor and ligand, molecular docking was performed using AutoDock software, and the affinity and hydrogen bonds of amino acid residues were analyzed using PyMOL. 2.13 Molecular dynamic simulation Gromacs2022.3 software was used for analysis, and added GAFF force field to small molecules through AmberTools22. Gaussian 16 W was used to hydrogenate small molecules and calculate their RESP potential. Static temperature was set of 300K and atmospheric pressure was set of 1 bar. Amber99sb-ildn was chosen as the force field, and water molecules (Tip3p water model) were selected as the solvent. The total charge of the simulation system was neutralized by adding an appropriate amount of Na+ ions. The energy minimization was carried out by using the steepest descent method, and then 100,000 steps of isothermal and isobaric ensemble (NVT) equilibrium and isothermal and isobaric ensemble (NPT) equilibrium were performed respectively. The coupling constant was set to 0.1 ps, and the whole process lasted for 100 ps. Finally, the free molecular dynamics simulation consisted of 5000000 steps, with a step size of 2fs and a total duration of 100ns. After the simulation was completed, the trajectories were analyzed using built-in software tools, and the protein rotation radius, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and root mean square deviation (RMSD) of each amino acid trajectory were calculated based on data such as free energy (MMGBSA) and free energy morphology. 3 Results The flow chart of this study is detailed in  Figure 1 Figure 1 Flow chart of this study (Figdraw, ID:UPSYS00f00).

Dimensionality reduction was achieved through the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method, whereas clustering was conducted using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a resolution parameter set at 0.8. All cells included in the study were divided into 24 different clusters through dimensionality reduction clustering analysis, and cell annotations were performed based on the expression of characteristic genes within each cluster and related article, resulting in a total of 11 cell types ( 20  Figures 2A, B  Supplementary Figures 1A, B Figure 2 Single cell RNA analysis of radiation-induced skin injury.

MMP3 FIB was enriched in pathways such as AGE-RAGE signaling in diabetic complications, TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and ECM-receptor interaction, as well as in cellular functions such as extracellular matrix organization, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, and glycosaminoglycan binding. It means that it plays an important role in the repair process (  Figures 3E-H  Supplementary Figure 2F 3.7 Pseudotime analysis of fibroblast subtypes The “CytoTRACE” R package was used to analyze the characteristics of fibroblast subtype differentiation.

Through a literature review, four herbal medicines (Berberine and Salidroside) were identified as potentially beneficial in the treatment of radiation-induced skin injuries. Molecular docking studies were conducted to explore whether these herbs regulated apoptosis by targeting TGFBR2. The results of molecular docking showed that each of the four active compounds had a binding energy with the TGFBR2 protein target lower than -5 kcal/mol, indicating spontaneous binding between the ligand and the receptor. The magnitude of the lowest binding energy was negatively correlated with the binding energy of small molecules to the target protein. Intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, aromatic interactions, and other types of interactions, can lead to tight binding, further suggesting that the active components and target protein can form more stable conformations, thus enhancing their binding affinity. For each docking simulation, 50 formations were generated, and the conformation with the best binding energy was selected for visualization, as shown in  Figures 6A, B Figure 6 Molecular docking and molecular dynamic results.

Panels A and B display 3D structures of TGFBR2 with each ligand highlighting key residues. Subsequent panels C through G present various data plots: RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, and the number of hydrogen bonds over time, comparing both ligand interactions. Panels H and I depict Gibbs energy landscapes, while J and K show 3D energy landscapes, visually representing binding stability and energy dynamics. 3.11 Molecular dynamic simulation result Molecular dynamic simulations were performed to verify the molecular docking simulation results of TGFBR2. The RMSD curves for the TGFBR2-Berberine and TGFBR2-Salidroside complexes showed equilibrium after 30 ns, with average RMSD values of 0.2 nm (  Figure 6C  Figure 6D  Figure 6E  Figure 6F  Figure 6G  Figures 6H-K The potential mechanism by which TGFBR2 mediates radiation-induced apoptosis in HSF is shown in the schematic (  Figure 7 Figure 7 Schematic of the mechanism of TGFBR2 in mediating radiation induced HSF apoptosis. (Figdraw, ID: WPTRS15c5c). Illustration of the TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β ligands bind to Type II receptors, activating Type I receptors. This leads to phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which forms a complex with Smad4. The complex translocates to the nucleus, interacting with transcription factors, co-repressors, and co-activators to regulate gene expression and induce apoptosis. Additional intermediates like RhoA, ROCK1, PP2A, p70S6K, and Smurf2 are involved in the pathway. 4 Discussion Radiation skin injury is a common skin injury after cancer radiation therapy, and about 95% of radiation therapy patients experience radiation skin injury, seriously affecting their quality of life ( 3 33 34 35 11 13 14 16 This study used single-cell data analysis and transcriptome data analysis to screen key genes and identify potential biological targets through molecular docking analysis. Subsequently, drug molecular dynamics simulation analysis was used to examine binding stability. Initially, this study used mouse single-cell data analysis to annotate cells by specifically expressing genes on the cell surface and ultimately obtained a total of 11 types of cells. Further analysis of intercellular communication and pathway enrichment showed that the signal intensity and quantity were high in fibroblasts, and the apoptotic pathway was significantly elevated. To further clarify the potential mechanisms involved, the regions with high expression of apoptosis pathways were analyzed using algorithms such as AUCell. The results showed that apoptosis-related genes and pathways are significantly overexpressed in the fibroblast region. Subsequently, to further clarify the potential mechanism of fibroblasts in the process of radiation-induced skin injury, an important fibroblast subtype named MMP3-FIB was identified through further classification of fibroblasts. The results of the pseudo-temporal analysis showed that MMP3-FIB was the first cell to distinguish between all fibroblast subtypes, serving as both a signal transmitter and a signal receiver for most cellular pathways. The results of enrichment analysis showed that MMP3-FIB cells were significantly enriched in various inflammatory response pathways, indicating that MMP3 cells play a crucial role in radiation-induced skin injury. In addition, the results of GSEA suggest that the apoptotic pathway in MMP3-FIB is significantly upregulated compared to other fibroblast subtypes, further highlighting the important role of the apoptotic pathway in MMP3-FIB cells. To further elucidate the mechanism of action of MMP3-FIB, transcriptome analysis was conducted to verify the differential expression of genes in MMP3-FIB. In addition, the LASSO machine learning algorithm is used to identify feature genes. Subsequently, six characteristic genes were identified, namely TUBB, S100A16, MMP19, SULF2, TMEM59, and TGFBR2. The TGFBR2 gene, also known as transforming growth factor beta receptor type II (TGF-ß receptor II), plays a crucial role in fibroblasts. The TGF-ß signaling pathway is an important signaling pathway in radiation-induced skin injury, which participates in the repair process of radiation-induced skin injury by promoting inflammatory response, tissue repair, and fibrosis processes. Mmp3 cells are the main signal receptors of the TGF-ß signaling pathway ( 17 36 38 39 in vitro In the context of radiation-induced skin injury, the inflammatory response is a critical early pathological process ( 10 40 41 41 42 43 44 45 in vitro In the molecular docking analysis, both Berberine and Salidroside demonstrated strong binding affinities to TGFBR2, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents capable of modulating this critical receptor involved in radiation-induced skin injury. Berberine exhibited stable interaction through multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts within the active pocket of TGFBR2, while Salidroside also established a favorable binding conformation with consistent hydrogen bonding. These interactions were further validated by molecular dynamics simulations, which confirmed the structural stability of the compound–receptor complexes over time. Berberine, exhibits dual activity by inhibiting fibroblast activation and modulating immune checkpoints. It downregulates IFN-γ–induced PD-L1 expression via the ITGB1/FAK axis, thereby enhancing T cell–mediated cytotoxicity and mitigating immune suppression ( 46 + 47 48 Taken together, these findings support that both Berberine and Salidroside may exert therapeutic effects not only by targeting fibroblast-mediated injury pathways but also by modulating the immune microenvironment associated with radiation-induced skin injury. Their ability to regulate key immune components—such as T cell activity, macrophage polarization, and cytokine production—provides compelling evidence of their dual action. This dual functionality positions these natural compounds as promising agents in precision immunomodulatory strategies, offering new perspectives for integrative treatment approaches in radiation-induced skin injury. Despite the promising immunomodulatory potential of Berberine and Salidroside identified in this study, their inherent physicochemical limitations—including poor water solubility, low oral bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and limited tissue targeting—pose significant challenges to the clinical translation. Recent advances in nanodelivery technologies have demonstrated promising solutions. Liposomal and nanoemulsion systems have been shown to significantly enhance the oral bioavailability and intestinal permeability of Berberine ( 49 50 51 52 53 This study also has some limitations. Firstly, although we identified the key subtype MMP3-FIB and the key gene TGFBR2 through single-cell data analysis, and validated their expression in vitro 5 Conclusion Fibroblasts play a vital role in maintaining skin homeostasis and orchestrating the repair response following the radiation.
