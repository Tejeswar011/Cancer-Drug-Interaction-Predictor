Design Population based cohort study. Setting QResearch database of primary care practices in England, 1 January 2013 to 13 July 2023, and patient electronic health records for prescribing information . Participants 1 978 348 women aged 40-60 years at any time over a 10 year period. Main outcome measures Overall uptake of two or more prescriptions of the same type of HRT in women of menopausal age, length of use, and association between ethnic group, deprivation, and geographical region and receiving a HRT prescription before and during the eight years since implementation of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on the menopause in 2015 in the UK. Results The cohort comprised 1 978 348 women with a mean age of 49.4 years, and 76.2% were white women. Overall, 379 911 (19.2%) women received two or more HRT prescriptions. Combination HRT formulations in one prescription were the most frequently prescribed (62.4% of those prescribed HRT), with 43.3% receiving oral and 26.3% transdermal formulations. Mean age at first prescription was 49.8 years. Rates for two or more prescriptions of HRT were higher in white women (22.6%) than in other ethnic groups, ranging from 8.9% in Caribbean women to 3.9% in black African women. Prescription rates decreased with increasing social deprivation, from 24.2% in the most affluent to 10.9% in the most deprived groups. London had lower prescription rates (11.7%) than other regions (all >19%). Multivariable Cox regression showed that non-white ethnic groups had significantly lower HRT prescription rates (hazard ratios 0.85-0.92, P<0.001), and each increase in social deprivation group was associated with lower HRT prescription rates (hazard ratio for the most deprived group 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 0.93, P<0.001). Conclusions This study identified differences in HRT prescribing in England based on ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and geographical location. White women and those in more affluent neighbourhoods were more likely to receive HRT than non-white women and those in more deprived areas. These findings suggest potential inequities that require further exploration.

Other factors reported to be associated with increasing severity of symptoms of menopause include obesity, being a current smoker, 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Known inequalities exist in HRT prescribing in the UK, with areas of highest deprivation having the lowest HRT prescribing rates. 23 24 UK data have also shown that general practices in affluent areas are more likely to prescribe transdermal HRT whereas in deprived areas, a higher proportion of oral HRT is prescribed. 23 25 10 8 Methods The study followed an open cohort from the QResearch database, which has health and prescribing records for >35 million patients, derived from about 1500 practices in England from Optum (formerly EMIS Health). 26 10 27 In this study, HRT uptake was defined as women who had at least two prescriptions 28 Box 1 29 Box 1 Individual hormone replacement therapy (HRT) groups Any HRT Any oestrogen Oral oestrogen Transdermal oestrogen Conjugated oestrogen Topical vaginal oestrogen Implant oestrogen Any oestrogen-progestogen Oral oestrogen-progestogen Transdermal oestrogen-progestogen Any progestogen Oral progestogen Vaginal progestogen Progestogen by intrauterine device Tibolone We calculated the uptake of different HRT formulations categorised into different groups, as described by previous researchers 30 31 30 Comorbidities were defined as any specified condition that was coded in the general practice records any time before the first prescription of HRT or, in those without a HRT prescription, at the date of study entry. To compare the route of administration in oestrogen or progestogen combined formulations (transdermal v Statistical methods The variables studied were Townsend deprivation score, ethnic group, and geographical region of England. Our main outcome was two or more prescriptions of the same type of HRT, from age 40 years to the end of follow-up, in women who were aged 40-60 years during the 10 year follow-up period from 2013 to 2023. Numbers and characteristics of women taking different types, doses, and routes of administration of HRT are reported, as well as length of use of HRT. Mean age and standard deviation (SD) at the first HRT prescription are also reported. Length of use by type of HRT is presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). We generated tables and graphs to report personal characteristics (age at study entry, ethnic group, Townsend deprivation score (divided into five equal groups), and geographical region of England, subdivided into 10 geographical regions) with appropriate summary statistics for the full cohort of women and women taking any formulation or dose of HRT. Prescriptions of any type of HRT, and different types of HRT and routes of administration were tabulated by Townsend deprivation group and ethnic group. Proportions of women with comorbid conditions were also described based on whether they received a HRT prescription. A missing indicator variable (not reported) was generated for those with missing data for ethnic group and deprivation, and used for descriptive and statistical analyses. To identify factors associated with receiving two or more HRT prescriptions from age 40 years, we used a Cox proportional hazards regression as our primary analysis, reporting hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to account for different lengths of follow-up for individuals after feedback from reviewers. As a secondary prespecified analysis, we used logistic regression (see protocol in online supplemental materials 8 Cox regression was used to compare HRT prescriptions in those who had received a diagnosis of a health condition before their first HRT prescription and those who did not have a diagnosis of any of the conditions in unadjusted models. We also compared HRT prescriptions by body mass index at cohort entry. Stata version 18MP (StataCorp, TX) was used for the data analyses. Significance was assumed at the 1% level. Patient and public involvement We were not able to share our results with research participants because we used anonymised health records. A patient co-applicant supported us in getting funding for this study and has continued to be involved in study management meetings. We recruited an ethnically and socially diverse group of five women who helped us make sense of the results and are supporting us with finding ways to communicate these results to the communities who need this information the most. We have created short text summaries and infographics of our results which will be shared with patients through support groups and charities. Results The full cohort comprised 1 978 348 women with a mean age in 2013 of 49.4 years (SD 6.0, median 49, IQR 44-54 years). Age ranged from 48.7 years in London to 49.8 years in the South West region of England.

IQR, interquartile range; SD, standard deviation. A total of 379 911 (19.2%) women in the full cohort received two or more HRT prescriptions at any time (oestrogen only, oestrogen-progestogen combined formulations, or oestrogen and progestogen (oral or by intrauterine device) prescribed separately); 458 803 (23.2%) women received at least one HRT prescription and 340 042 (17.2%) received three or more HRT prescriptions. Table 1 Mean age at first prescription of HRT was 49.8 (SD 5.4) years. When we restricted our analysis to prescriptions from 2016 (n=205 909), 125 014 (60.7%) women received combined oestrogen and progestogen in one prescription, with 31% of those with a HRT prescription receiving an oral combined formulation and 40% a transdermal combined formulation. Some women (6.9%) received prescriptions for both oral and transdermal formulations. In the cohort, 121 285 (58.9%) women received a prescription for an oestrogen only formulation after 2016 and a higher proportion of women received transdermal oestrogens (56.4% of all women on HRT) than oral oestrogen (6.7% of all women on HRT). Some women (2.0%) received prescriptions for both oral and transdermal formulations.

Table 3 Online supplemental table 14 Discussion Principal findings In this analysis of almost two million women aged 40-60 years in 2013-23 in the UK, we found that 19.2% of women received at least two HRT prescriptions, but this value varied from 3.9% of women from the black African ethnic group to 22.6% in white women. HRT prescribing rates for women living in the most affluent neighbourhoods were more than double those in the most deprived neighbourhoods (24.2% v The likelihood of receiving two or more HRT prescriptions from age 40 years was significantly lower for each increase in social deprivation group, with a hazard ratio of 0.92 for the most deprived (group 5) compared with the most affluent (group 1) group during follow-up. Women in the most deprived areas were less likely to receive transdermal preparations than those in the most affluent areas, for both oestrogen prescriptions (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.87) and combined oestrogen-progestogen formulations (odds ratio 0.89, 0.82 to 0.96). HRT prescribing rates were significantly higher in all regions of England than in London, after adjusting for ethnic group and social deprivation. These patterns in prescribing were seen for all types of HRT and routes of administration examined. The trends in prescribing by ethnic group and social deprivation remained after publication of the NICE menopause guideline in 2015, 8 Strengths and limitations of this study In this study, we quantified ethnic differences in HRT prescribing at an individual level for nine ethnic groups in English primary care data. We used data from a large cohort of women with robust data on self-assigned ethnic group, social deprivation, and region of England, so that we could quantify differences in HRT prescribing across different sociodemographic characteristics. By using electronic health records of HRT prescriptions and dates from general practice records, we could accurately determine the number and timing of prescriptions for each individual. Our study used several different statistical methods to analyse the data and we specifically looked at recent HRT prescribing to determine whether publication of the NICE guidance in 2015 has changed prescribing patterns. 8 Our study had some limitations. Having a HRT prescription does not necessarily mean that an individual received their drug treatment or took it appropriately. To mitigate against this limitation, we used data only from women who received two or more prescriptions for the same type of drug treatment in our primary analyses as an indicator of likely use. We also reported the proportion of women who received at least one prescription and three or more prescriptions of HRT as well as the characteristics of those who had longer follow-up times to capture more women who might have had menopausal symptoms. Trends in prescribing were similar in all groups but our data did not include prescriptions from specialist secondary care or private settings. Inclusion of private prescription data, however, could exacerbate the trends seen in socioeconomic status. We did not have data on intrauterine devices fitted in secondary care, but we included oestrogen only prescriptions and therefore these would be included under any HRT prescriptions. Although ethnic group was recorded based on self-identified ethnic group and was complete for >94% of women, many ethnic groups or different cultural groups exist that were not included within the nine groups in the QResearch database (eg, Eastern European populations living in England). In our analysis, missing data on ethnic group and social deprivation were included as a missing category. Our study was informed and supported by a diverse patient group who helped us identify concerns and ensured our work was relevant to women. The Townsend deprivation index is a widely used measure of material deprivation based on four variables, including car ownership. Car ownership may not be the best measure of deprivation, however, particularly in urban areas, not owning a car might not always accurately reflect actual deprivation, which is a limitation of our analyses. Comparison with other studies Previous reports of HRT prescribing in different ethnic groups in the US 33 In the UK, a 1999 survey in an ethnically diverse population in South London reported that women from Caribbean, West African, or South Asian ethnic groups were less likely to be taking HRT than their white counterparts. 24 34 8 In many countries, greater use of HRT has been reported to be associated with higher education status, higher income, and greater affluence. 35 38 34 23 23 39 When we examined prescription of individual HRT formulations, with oral and transdermal oestrogen prescriptions as example formulations, we found similar trends for transdermal oestrogen prescribing, but the trend for fewer prescriptions with increasing social deprivation was no longer significant for oral oestrogen prescriptions. When comparing prescriptions of transdermal with oral preparations, however, we found a significant trend towards lower rates of prescribing with increasing deprivation for both oestrogens and progestogens. Although lower prescribing of transdermal preparations in the most deprived group was no longer significant after publication of NICE guidance, 8 23 25 40 41 Our analysis showed that those with breast cancer and sickle cell disease had the lowest rates of HRT prescribing. HRT is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, which varies by type and length of use of HRT. 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 We found that those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, malabsorption conditions, and osteoporosis had the highest rates of HRT prescribing. HRT can be beneficial for those with osteoporosis. 8 50 Some lifestyle factors and health conditions that are most prevalent in areas of high social deprivation, such as diabetes, 16 51 52 53 43 Although the average length of menopausal symptoms is seven years, 1 1 1 13 54 1 We also established that a proportion of women who receive one prescription of HRT do not then receive a second prescription. The proportion of women who received only one prescription relative to those who received a second prescription was higher in women from all ethnic groups other than white women. We do not know the reasons for this difference without further investigation, but these women might have changed their mind about taking HRT, or wanted to accept the prescription to please their doctor, or they tried HRT and did not find it helpful enough. These data indicate differences in populations with symptoms of menopause and the proportion that then receives HRT. We found that the average age of the first HRT prescription was 49 years. As the average age of menopause in the UK is 51 years, 55 34 Study implications for clinicians and policy makers In this study, we identified, described, and quantified differences in HRT prescribing by individual characteristics based on UK primary care data. Whether women who received HRT were those with the most severe symptoms of menopause is unclear, as is whether comorbidities or preferences against the prescribing of HRT exist in some of these groups. One explanation for the lower rates of prescribing in some groups could be lack of awareness, difficulty in describing menopause and symptoms, or not receiving care from a female practitioner for women from some ethnic groups. 56 57 Future research Further research should determine if women with the most severe symptoms are those receiving HRT or if some women who need HRT are not receiving this treatment, leaving an unmet clinical need. Understanding more about choices made by women and potential preferences for non-hormonal treatments is important. Also, understanding whether women need more information about managing the symptoms of menopause, and how clinicians navigate consultations about menopause and treatments including HRT. Conclusions We have identified differences in HRT prescribing in England based on ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and geographical location. White women and those in more affluent neighbourhoods were more likely to receive HRT than non-white women and those in more deprived areas. These findings suggest potential inequities that require further study.
