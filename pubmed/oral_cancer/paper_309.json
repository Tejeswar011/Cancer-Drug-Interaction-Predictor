Diabetes is correlated with adverse prognostic outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the cancer-associated endothelial niche is reshaped in the diabetic pancreatic tumor microenvironment and enhances the tumor-promoting capacity. Senescent endothelial cells expand in the diabetic tumor microenvironment and produce a potential senescence-associated secretory phenotype factor, i.e., INHBB. As a member of the TGF-β superfamily, INHBB promotes tumor progression and is regulated by Notch signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of INHBB receptors with bimagrumab effectively inhibited tumor progression in diabetic mice. Moreover, short-term bimagrumab treatment did not significantly decrease glucose levels in diabetic tumor-bearing mice. Combination treatment with metformin showed synergistic antitumor effects. In conclusion, our study identifies INHBB as a promising therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer with comorbid diabetes, laying the foundation for the development of individualized therapies for pancreatic cancer patients. Diabetes can contribute to pancreatic cancer development as well as be a consequence of it. Here, the authors report that diabetes-induced senescence of endothelial cells promotes pancreatic cancer progression.

The 5-year survival rate remains poor, predominantly because most patients have advanced, unresectable disease at initial diagnosis 1 2 3 5 Angiogenesis is critical for tumor progression and is a hallmark of cancer 6 7 8 9 10 11 Cellular senescence is a permanent state of cell cycle arrest 12 G12V G12V Q61R H1047R E17K 13 14 15 17 18 19 20 26 27 28 18 29 33 In this study, we demonstrate that diabetes reshapes the cancer-associated endothelial niche. Tumor endothelial cells undergo senescence and secrete INHBB as a SASP factor that promotes pancreatic cancer progression. Targeting the INHBB receptor activin receptor type II (ActRII) with bimagrumab, a monoclonal antibody previously evaluated for obesity treatment that acts by regulating skeletal muscle growth and fat consumption, significantly attenuated tumor progression in diabetic mice. Collectively, our findings provide a potential therapeutic rationale for targeted therapies in pancreatic cancer patients with concomitant diabetes. Results Diabetes is associated with pancreatic cancer progression and poor prognosis First, we analyzed pancreatic cancer patient cohorts from the publicly available MSK-IMPACT database and our institution’s clinicopathological data (Xijing Hospital cohort). In the MSK-IMPACT cohort, records of 2336 PDAC patients were collected; 2270 had overall survival records, and 1418 had records of whether they have diabetes or not. After 918 metastatic and 114 locally advanced PDAC patients were excluded, 386 patients were included (273 without diabetes and 113 with diabetes). KRAS mutations were present in 94.8% of the tumors (Supplementary Table 1 1a 1 1 1a Fig. 1 Diabetes accelerates pancreatic cancer progression and is associated with a poor prognosis. a n n n b n n n c d n e n f n g n h n i n j n k n P a b e g j k t h Table 1 Cox regression for overall survival in primary pancreatic cancer patients from the MSK-IMPACT cohort Variables Univariate Cox regression Multivariate Cox regression Hazard ratio (95% CI) P Hazard ratio (95% CI) P Age (years) 1.005 (0.993−1.018) 0.388 Sex Female 1.000 0.443 Male 1.107 (0.854−1.435) Diabetes Without 1.000 0.021 1.000 0.041 With 1.376 (1.049−1.805) 1.328 (1.011–1.743) Autoimmune disease Without 1.000 0.957 With 0.985 (0.573−1.693) Coronary artery disease Without 1.000 0.055 With 1.424 (0.993−2.042) Hypertension Without 1.000 0.972 With 1.005 (0.775−1.302) Pancreatitis Without 1.000 0.960 With 1.010 (0.671−1.521) Cancer history False 1.000 0.397 True 0.887 (0.672−1.171) Smoking False 1.000 0.266 True 1.160 (0.893−1.505) Tumor location Head 1.000 0.855 Body/tail 1.027 (0.768−1.373) Neoadjuvant therapy False 1.000 0.092 True 1.570 (0.929−2.652) Mutation count 1.080 (1.032−1.130) 0.001 1.076 (1.027−1.129) 0.002 Mutation KRAS 1.000 MAPK 0.772 (0.343−1.738) 0.532 Wild type 0.701 (0.289−1.703) 0.433 Tumor purity 1.568 (0.551–4.465) 0.400 In the Xijing Hospital cohort, we included 339 PDAC patients who underwent surgery.

First, we constructed 4 mouse models representing different stages of diabetes (Fig. 1c 1d, e 1d–g 1d–g 1h 1i–k 1e–h Diabetes reshapes the tumor endothelial niche We conducted bulk RNA-seq analysis on Pan02 tumor tissues from the HFD + STZ and chow groups.

Senescence was confirmed by SA-β-Gal staining and elevated senescence/SASP marker expression (Supplementary Fig. 4a–f 4a–f 4g 4g 4h–k 4h–k 4l, m 4l, m 4n, o 38 40 41 Fig. 4 Senescent endothelial cells support tumor progression. a n b c b c n d n e f e f n g h n i n j n k n l m l m n P a d t c f i j k m Notch signaling is activated in senescent TEC clusters Notch signaling is a critical pathway that regulates endothelial cell fate.

INHBB was upregulated across all the gene sets (Fig. 6a 6b 6c 6d, e 3h 6f–h 6i, j 5c–f Fig. 6 INHBB is a potential SASP factor. a b c d e f g f g h i j i j k n n l n n n n m n o p o p q a d m n n n n n e j n e n q n P c d t e g h p l j n We sought to clarify whether INHBB contributes to tumor progression. Analysis of data from the GEPIA2 database revealed higher INHBB expression in PDAC tissues than in normal pancreatic tissues (Fig. 6k 6l 6m 6n–p 6q Notch signaling regulates INHBB expression Since Notch signaling was enriched in the senescent endothelial cell cluster, we investigated whether Notch signaling modulates the expression of INHBB. We found that the expression of INHBB was positively correlated with the Notch signaling score based on scRNA-seq data (Fig. 7a 44 GSE111127 GSE163568 GSE40403 7b 7c 7d–f Fig. 7 Notch signaling regulates the expression of INHBB. a n n n n b GSE163568 GSE40403 GSE111127 n c n d n e f e f n g ERT flox/flox n ERT flox/flox ECKO n ECKO n h n ECKO n ECKO n i n ECKO n ECKO n j k j k ECKO n l m l m ECKO n P a t b c f k m d h i We then generated RBPJ ECKO 7g–i ECKO 7j, k 7l, m Bimagrumab inhibits diabetic pancreatic cancer progression Because targeting endothelial Notch signaling or specifically eliminating senescent TECs is difficult to achieve for translational therapy in vivo, we aimed to discover agents targeting the SASP factor INHBB. According to the results of the CellChat analysis, the INHBB-ActRII pathway mediated the interaction between senescent TECs and cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 3e 45 8a 6a 8b 6b 8c–e 6c, d 8c–e 6c, d 8f 6e 8g, h 6f–i 8i–l 8c–f 6c–e Fig. 8 Bimagrumab inhibits tumor progression in diabetic mice. a b n n c n n d n n e n n f n g n h n i j i j n k l k l n P d f h j l d e Discussion It is well known that diabetes promotes premature cellular senescence in multiple organs and tissues, including pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, and the cardiovascular system 29 33 46 28 47 50 28 47 50 51 22 25 52 56 Our previous study demonstrated that Notch signaling regulates liver sinusoidal endothelial cell senescence and plays a crucial role in liver regeneration 42 43 57 Based on the results of the bioinformatic analysis, we identified INHBB as a potential SASP factor that is specifically expressed in senescent TECs. Recent studies have indicated that INHBB participates in tumorigenesis in breast, gastric, hepatocellular, and prostate carcinomas 58 59 45 60 61 62 62 63 This study has several limitations. First, whether diabetes affects tumorigenesis, including early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions, was not investigated and requires elucidation using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Second, the effects of long-term bimagrumab treatment on diabetic pancreatic tumor regression and metabolic improvement remain uncharacterized. Third, while senescent endothelial cells only slightly promoted pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro, they significantly accelerated tumor progression in vivo. We propose that in vivo malignant behavior involves multifactorial influences that cannot be fully extrapolated from in vitro results. Enhanced migratory capacity may also drive tumor growth through increased invasion potential. Additionally, as INHBB belongs to the TGF-β superfamily, it may induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation to promote tumor progression 59 64 40 Methods Patients To investigate whether a history of diabetes is associated with the prognosis of primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological and follow-up data of patients with resectable primary pancreatic cancer treated from 2015 to 2020 at the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Xijing Hospital (Xi’an, China). The inclusion criteria were as follows: ① pathologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma following surgical resection; ② absence of distant metastasis; ③ primary tumors deemed resectable through pre- and intraoperative evaluation; ④ documented records pertaining to diabetes history; and ⑤ complete pathological records. The exclusion criteria were as follows: ① metastatic disease at diagnosis (e.g., liver metastasis); ② unresectable tumors due to poor physiological status or vascular invasion precluding resection or reconstruction (e.g., celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery or portal vein involvement); ③ missing diabetes history records; ④ absence of pathological documentation; and ⑤ lack of postoperative follow-up. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and included a statement on the clinicopathological data for scientific research, with no financial compensation provided. Sex was determined through self-reports. Ethics approval was granted by the Medical Ethics Committee of Xijing Hospital (approval number: KY20243015-1; 5 March 2024). Publicly available clinical and survival data for PDAC patients were collected from the cBioPortal database ( http://www.cbioportal.org/ Animals Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) male C57BL/6J mice (strain # N00010 ECKO ERT flox/flox 65 ECKO Diabetic models To observe tumor progression in vivo, we established four mouse models representing different diabetes stages on a C57BL/6J background: ① The chow group: 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice received a normal diet for 4 weeks, followed by intraperitoneal injection of citrate buffer (49.5% 0.1 M citric acid monohydrate, 60347ES25, Yeasen; 50.5% 0.1 M trisodium citrate dihydrate, 60348ES25, Yeasen) for 5 consecutive days. ② The 4-week HFD group: Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; D12492, Research Diets, 60% fat) for 4 weeks and then received citrate buffer injections as described above. ③ The 16-week HFD group: Mice were fed a HFD for 16 weeks to serve as a prediabetic or early-stage diabetic model characterized by impaired glucose tolerance and mild fasting hyperglycemia. ④ The HFD + STZ group: Mice were fed a HFD for 4 weeks, followed by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg; S0130; Sigma‒Aldrich) for 5 consecutive days, after which type 2 diabetes with significant fasting hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance was induced. Ten days after injection, fasting blood glucose levels were measured after a 10-h fast. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) were used to assess glucose tolerance. Diabetic mice were defined as those with a fasting glucose concentration ≥11.1 mmol/L and impaired glucose tolerance. To exclude direct effects of STZ on tumors, HFD + STZ mice received insulin glargine (5 IU/kg, subcutaneous injection, Sanofi-Aventis) every 12 h. Prefasting blood glucose levels were measured 10 h after insulin injection to prevent hypoglycemia-related mortality. Orthotopic pancreatic cancer models Two weeks after STZ or citrate buffer injection, 3 × 10⁵ KPC cells or 1 × 10⁶ Pan02 cells were orthotopically injected into the pancreatic capsule. Tumor-bearing mice were euthanized 14 days after inoculation. For RBPJ ECKO ERT flox/flox Cell lines Pan02 cells, HUVECs, and PANC-1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). KPC cells (cat. no. NM-YD04) were purchased from Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc. The cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (P/S). To induce senescence, HUVECs were treated with hydrogen peroxide (HO, 300 μM) for 24 h or with high glucose (HG, 25 mmol/L) and palmitic acid (PA, 300 μmol/L) for 48 h. Single-cell RNA-Seq data processing To perform scRNA-seq analysis on the pancreatic cancer model, cell suspensions derived from pancreatic tumors of chow ( n n scRNA-seq data for clinical pancreatic cancer patients were also obtained from the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA) database (accession number CRA001160, ngdc.cncb.ac.cn). To address batch effects, the Harmony package was applied as described above. Cell type annotations and clinical feature data can be downloaded from the CRA001160 dataset. Cell markers for each cell type were obtained from the published article associated with this dataset 36 66 Endothelial cell subtype analysis To further investigate endothelial cell heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer patients with or without diabetes, endothelial cell subsets were extracted and subjected to unsupervised clustering. Based on published literature 37 46 Cell–cell crosstalk network analysis To investigate cell crosstalk between different endothelial subtypes and pancreatic cancer cells, the CellChat package (version 1.6.1) was used. Ligand–receptor pairs with P Bulk RNA-seq analysis RNA extraction, sequencing and analysis were performed by Gene Denovo (Guangzhou, China) using an Illumina HiSeq3000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Briefly, pancreatic tumor tissues were collected from chow or HFD + STZ mice ( n GSE266899 www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ 34 Differentially expressed gene analysis and pathway enrichment From the scRNA-seq data, cluster-specific marker genes for each endothelial subtype were identified using the FindAllMarkers function in the Seurat package based on normalized expression data. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between endothelial cells in the control and diabetic groups were identified with the FindMarkers function. With respect to the bulk RNA-seq data, DEGs between the control and diabetic groups were identified using the DESeq2 package (version 1.38.3). Statistical significance was assessed by the Wilcoxon test, and the Benjamini–Hochberg correction was used to adjust the P Flow cytometry To determine the ratio of senescent endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment, flow cytometry was used to compare the abundance of CD45 − + + C10841 2i 3 Primary tumor endothelial cell isolation Orthotopic pancreatic tumors were mechanically minced and digested in 1 mg/mL collagenase IV (Sigma‒Aldrich, C5138) and 100 μg/mL DNase I (Roche, 10104159001) for 25 min at 37 °C. After filtration through a 70-μm strainer, the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 350 × g − Immunofluorescence staining Tumor tissues were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura, 4583), followed by 4 h of fixation in 4% PFA and overnight dehydration in 30% sucrose. Frozen sections were air-dried at room temperature for 2 h. The sections were subsequently washed three times with PBS, blocked with immunostaining blocking buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Beyotime, P0102) for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After the sections were washed with PBS, they were incubated with secondary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by nuclear staining with DAPI (Servicebio, G1012) for 10 min at room temperature. Images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 3 Immunohistochemistry staining Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% PFA (Servicebio, G1101) and embedded in paraffin. The sections were subjected to deparaffinization, rehydration, and antigen retrieval, treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 25 min, and then washed three times with PBS. After blocking with 3% BSA for 30 min, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Following three washes with PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 60 min, washed three times with PBS, and developed with DAB substrate (the development time was microscopically optimized). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 3 min, rinsed with tap water, briefly immersed in a hematoxylin differentiation solution, rinsed, treated with a hematoxylin bluing solution, and rinsed again. Images were acquired using a brightfield microscope. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 3 Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining After deparaffinization and rehydration, sections were stained with hematoxylin for 5–10 min, rinsed briefly in distilled water, treated with hematoxylin differentiation solution, rinsed with tap water, immersed in hematoxylin bluing solution, and rinsed again. The sections were then dehydrated in 95% ethanol for 1 min and stained with eosin for 1–3 min. Images were acquired using a brightfield microscope. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining SA-β-gal activity was assessed in tumor tissues and cultured cells using a senescence β-galactosidase staining kit (Beyotime, C0602). Cells or tissue sections were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature. After 3 washes with PBS, β-galactosidase staining solution was added (930 μL of staining solution C supplemented with 10 μL of solution A, 10 μL of solution B, and 50 μL of X-Gal; pH 6.0), and the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C without CO₂. The samples were subsequently washed three times with PBS, and blue staining was examined by microscopy. In vitro and in vivo coculture assays Primary TECs were cultured in endothelial cell medium (ScienCell, 1001) for 24 h. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g Activin B treatment assay To evaluate the protumoral effects of Activin B, Pan02 cells were treated with 50 ng/mL recombinant Activin B for 24 h. Proliferation and migration were assessed. Phosphorylated Smad2 levels were analyzed by Western blotting. For in vivo studies, 2 × 10⁶ Pan02 cells in Matrigel containing 2 μg/mL Activin B were injected into the pancreatic capsules of RBPJ ECKO Cell proliferation assay KPC, Pan02 or PANC-1 cells (2 × 10³) were seeded in 96-well plates. CCK-8 assays were conducted after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Next, 110 μL of DMEM containing 10 μL of CCK-8 solution was added per well and incubated for 2 h (37 °C, 5% CO₂). The absorbance (450 nm) was measured using a microplate reader. Cell migration assay For migration assays, 4 × 10⁴ KPC/Pan02 cells or 6 × 10⁴ PANC-1 cells in serum-free DMEM were seeded into 8.0-µm-pore Transwell inserts (Corning, CLS3422; 6.5 mm diameter). The lower chamber contained 800 μL of DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. After 24 h of incubation (37 °C, 5% CO₂), nonmigrated cells on the upper surface of the insert were removed using a cotton swab. The migrated cells on the lower surface were fixed in 4% PFA and stained with 1% crystal violet. Images were acquired using a brightfield microscope. Real-time quantitative PCR assay RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s protocol. For cDNA synthesis, 500 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Accurate Biology, AG11728). qPCR was performed on a Bio-Rad real-time PCR system. Gene expression was normalized to that of endogenous controls and calculated via the ΔΔCt method. The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 4 Western blotting Proteins from tumors or cells were extracted in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. The protein concentration was quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, P0012). A total of 15–20 µg of protein was separated by 10% SDS‒PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk or 5% BSA (1 h, room temperature) and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After three TBST washes, the membranes were incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1 h, room temperature). The proteins were detected using ECL reagents. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table 3 ELISA Activin B concentrations in tumor lysates were measured as follows: Tumors were homogenized in PBS containing protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 5000× g In vivo ABT-263 treatment To eliminate senescent cells in the diabetic tumor microenvironment, HFD + STZ C57BL/6J mice bearing orthotopic tumors (KPC and Pan02 graft models) received a daily oral administration of ABT-263 (100 mg/kg, HY-10087, Navitoclax, MedChemExpress) or vehicle for 7 consecutive days (7–13 days after injection). The mice were sacrificed on day 14 after injection. Fasting blood glucose was measured after the final dose. Tumors were sampled and embedded in OCT for double immunofluorescence staining. Chow-fed C57BL/6J mice receiving vehicle served as negative controls. In vivo bimagrumab treatment To assess the therapeutic effects of INHBB receptor inhibition on diabetic tumors, tumor-bearing chow and HFD + STZ mice (KPC and Pan02 models) received weekly subcutaneous injections of 20 mg/kg bimagrumab (HY-P99355, BYM338, MedChemExpress) or the IgG1λ1 isotype control (HY-P99992; MedChemExpress) on days 7 and 14 after injection. After two doses, the mice were sacrificed on day 16. Diabetic tumor-bearing mice additionally received daily intraperitoneal injections of metformin (250 mg/kg, D150959; Sigma‒Aldrich) for 7 days (days 7–13). Fasting blood glucose was measured after the final dose. Bilateral tibialis anterior muscles were harvested to assess posttreatment changes in muscle mass. Survival analysis Cox regression was used to assess the association between diabetes history and overall survival in primary pancreatic cancer cohorts (MSK-IMPACT and Xijing Hospital). Significant univariable Cox factors were included in the multivariate analysis. Kaplan‒Meier and restricted mean survival time (RMST) analyses were performed to determine the associations between overall survival and diabetes history/preoperative fasting glucose using R packages (survival, version 3.5–7; survRM2, version 1.0.4). The Kaplan‒Meier plotter database ( https://kmplot.com/analysis Statistics and reproducibility Group differences in categorical variables were assessed by Pearson chi-square tests. For continuous variables, nonnormally distributed data were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, whereas normally distributed data were analyzed by Student’s t t P Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary Supplementary information  Supplementary Infomation Description of Additional Supplementary Information Supplementary Dataset 1 Supplementary Dataset 2 Supplementary Dataset 3 Supplementary Dataset 4 Reporting Summary Transparent Peer Review file Source data  Source Data Publisher’s Note These authors contributed equally: Yu-Wei Ling, Juan-Li Duan, Zi-Jian Jiang, Zhen Yang.
