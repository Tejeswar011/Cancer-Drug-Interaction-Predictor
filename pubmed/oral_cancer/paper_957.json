Introduction Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) represents one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies worldwide, with over 90% of ovarian cancer cases originating from the transformation of surface epithelial cells [ 1 2 3 4 Epithelial ovarian cancers are classified into two major types based on their biological behavior and genetic stability. Type I EOCs are relatively indolent tumors often originating from endometriosis or borderline tumors with low malignant potential. In contrast, Type II EOCs are biologically aggressive, exhibiting high metastatic propensity even from small primary lesions [ 5 6 7 8 Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 9 CDK1 10 11 CDK1 12 CDK1 13 14 CDK1 15 CDK1 16 While several studies have investigated the role of cell cycle regulators in ovarian cancer, there exists a significant knowledge gap regarding the potential of specifically targeting CDK1 in epithelial ovarian cancer [ 17 18 19 20 21 13 14 22 In this study, we employed an integrated bioinformatics approach to identify differentially expressed genes in EOC, constructing a gene network to elucidate key hub genes with CDK1 2.

Microarray Data Analysis We identified 2982 genes that were consistently differentially expressed across the three EOC datasets ( GSE28799 GSE54388 GSE14407 p 2 2 Supplementary Figure S1 CDK1 2.2. Differential Expression Analysis of CDK1 Signal box plot analysis revealed distinct data distributions between EOC and control datasets, as shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 A heatmap of RNA-seq data from the TCGA/GTEx datasets was constructed to illustrate the expression of key cell cycle regulators across 33 cancer types.

Protein–Protein Interaction Network Analysis To gain comprehensive insight into the interaction landscape of the most dysregulated genes, the top-ranked upregulated DEGs were mapped into the STRING database, and the resulting network was analyzed in Cytoscape 3.10.0 using the CytoHubba plugin 0.1. Multiple network centrality measures consistently highlighted CDK1 as the most influential hub gene, underscoring its central role within the ovarian cancer interactome.

Proteomic and Survival Analyses Kaplan–Meier analysis of the EOC dataset, over a 60-month follow-up revealed that patients with elevated CDK1 expression (analyzed as the CDC2 probe ID 203213_at in the Kaplan–Meier Plotter) exhibited significantly poorer overall survival.

Pharmacokinetic Property Analysis Comprehensive analysis using the AdmetSAR database provided valuable pharmacokinetic insights for the selected compounds ( Table 2 3. Discussion Tumor progression relies on precise gene expression patterns, with specific genes upregulated while others are downregulated. Our microarray analysis revealed distinct expression profiles between ovarian epithelial cancer cells and normal counterparts, validated through comprehensive heatmap analysis. What distinguishes this study from previous reports is the convergence of multiple computational layers—DEG validation across cohorts, hub gene ranking via machine learning, and molecular modeling—to highlight CDK1 not merely as a known oncogene but as a viable dual-target candidate in EOC when co-targeted with WEE1. Our protein–protein interaction network analysis identified CDK1 TOP2A CDK1 CDK1 CDK1 Figure 4 CDK1 23 CDK1 24 CDK1 CDK1 E2F1 FOXM1 25 26 The PI3K pathway, frequently altered in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), plays a crucial role in chemoresistance and genomic stability maintenance [ 27 CDK1 CCNB1 28 Our machine learning approaches significantly enhanced the identification of CDK1 29 Numerous investigations have demonstrated that phosphorylation of CDK1 at the Tyr15 site inhibits its activity, impeding cell division in the G2 phase [ 30 31 32 The CDK1/Cyclin B1 complex functions as the primary regulator of G2/M transition, and reduction in CDK1 activity significantly impedes this critical checkpoint [ 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Our molecular dynamics simulations provided unprecedented insights into CDK1 inhibition by Naringin. The 100-nanosecond simulations revealed that Naringin binding induces subtle conformational changes while preserving overall protein architecture. The consistent RMSD values confirm the formation of a stable protein-ligand complex, while radius of gyration analysis demonstrates maintained structural integrity. RMSF analysis shows localized flexibility increases in specific loop regions upon Naringin binding, suggesting an induced-fit mechanism critical for inhibitory function. These insights provide a structural framework for understanding how naturally derived compounds can effectively modulate kinase activity [ 29 Using in silico approaches and molecular docking, we confirmed the inhibitory effects of several compounds on CDK1, with Alsterpaullone, Avotaciclib, Fostamatinib, and Naringin demonstrating efficacious inhibitory effects on both CDK1 and WEE1. This dual-targeting approach holds substantial potential for enhanced therapeutic efficacy in controlling ovarian cancer, potentially delaying treatment resistance [ 42 Naringin, a dihydroflavonoid derived from grapefruit peel, emerged as a particularly promising candidate drug. AdmetSAR analysis yielded favorable predictions, including negative indicators for blood–brain barrier penetration, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and Ames mutagenesis. Despite its inability to cross the blood–brain barrier and negative oral bioavailability profile, careful optimization of administration methods could maximize its therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. In addition to in silico ADMET predictions, previous in vivo and in vitro studies have also demonstrated the favorable safety profile of Naringin. It exhibits low toxicity in normal cells and organs, including the liver and kidneys, and has been reported to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic effects in various models. These properties further support its therapeutic potential with minimal adverse effects in clinical applications. Compared to RO-3306—a synthetic CDK1 inhibitor—Naringin offers several potential advantages at both the molecular and translational levels. While RO-3306 selectively targets CDK1, Naringin demonstrates dual-binding affinity toward both CDK1 and WEE1, as supported by our docking and molecular dynamics results. This dual inhibition may provide a more robust blockade of mitotic progression. Moreover, Naringin’s origin as a natural flavonoid contributes to its favorable safety profile, with lower systemic toxicity compared to synthetic counterparts. Its additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties further enhance its therapeutic appeal, positioning Naringin as a promising alternative to conventional synthetic CDK1 inhibitors for ovarian cancer treatment. In conclusion, our integrated approach identified CDK1 as a central regulatory hub in ovarian epithelial cancer and revealed Naringin as a promising dual-target inhibitor of both CDK1 and WEE1. Among all candidates tested, Naringin demonstrated the most favorable dual-inhibitory profile with minimal toxicity risk. The favorable safety profile and dual-targeting capacity of Naringin position it as a compelling candidate for further development as a targeted therapy for ovarian cancer. 4.

Creation of Protein–Protein Interaction Network Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using the STRING database ( https://string-db.org/ 44 https://cytoscape.org/ 45 4.3. Validation of CDK1 Gene Validation of CDK1 http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/ 46 https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga CDK1 CDK1 47 CDK1 p https://www.proteinatlas.org/ 48 Protein expression patterns of CDK1 were retrieved from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database using the validated antibody HPA003387. This rabbit monoclonal antibody was applied at a 1:200 dilution to formalin-fixed human tissues, where CDK1 expression was visualized using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. The HPA platform utilizes a semi-automated algorithm to classify staining results into four expression categories (high, medium, low, or not detected), based on both DAB staining intensity and the percentage of positively stained cells. These standardized evaluations enhance inter-sample comparability and reproducibility across datasets. Microscopy images were acquired at 40× magnification across selected human cell lines [ 49 4.4.

Pharmacological Effects In Silico Based on hub gene expression analysis, CDK1 https://www.rcsb.org/ 51 52 https://www.uniprot.org/ 53 54 Binding sites for drug targeting were identified through the COACH database ( https://zhanggroup.org/COACH/ 55 https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 56 Molecular docking simulations were conducted using AutoDock Vina 1.2.x (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) [ 57 58 https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de/plip-web/plip/index 59 https://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2 60 Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS for 100 nanoseconds to evaluate CDK1 stability in both apo and Naringin-bound states. The CHARMM36 force field was applied, and the system was solvated in a TIP3P water molecule cubic box. Following energy minimization and equilibration in NVT and NPT ensembles, production runs were conducted with calculations of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), and root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) to assess conformational stability and flexibility [ 61 4.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using R 4.3.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and Python 3.11. Differential expression was evaluated with the limma package 3.21 in R 4.3.2, applying the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for multiple testing correction. Network topology and enrichment analyses were conducted using igraph 2.1.4 (igraph Development Team, Vienna, Austria) and clusterProfiler 3.21 (Bioconductor project, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China), whereas machine learning–based feature prioritization was implemented with scikit-learn. Survival correlations were analyzed with the survival package, and data visualization was carried out using ggplot2 in R 4.3.2 and matplotlib 3.9 in Python 3.11. Statistical significance was considered at p p 62 63 5. Conclusions Transcriptome profiling combined with machine learning inference and in silico simulations identified CDK1 6. Limitations and Future Directions While this computational investigation establishes CDK1 as a pivotal therapeutic target in epithelial ovarian cancer and demonstrates Naringin’s potential as a dual CDK1/WEE1 inhibitor, several methodological constraints warrant careful consideration. The absence of experimental validation represents the most significant limitation, as comprehensive in vitro assays examining antiproliferative mechanisms and downstream signaling pathways remain essential prerequisites for validating computational predictions. Subsequent in vivo studies will be critical for establishing therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetic profiles, and safety margins, given that computational frameworks cannot fully recapitulate the complex tumor microenvironment and host-drug interactions that ultimately determine clinical success. The reliance on publicly available GEO datasets, though providing valuable transcriptomic insights, introduces inherent constraints related to sample composition, particularly the markedly limited normal ovarian tissue representation across datasets (2–5 samples per cohort), potentially compromising statistical power and the reliability of differential gene expression analyses. Although empirical Bayes moderation within the LIMMA framework partially addresses small sample limitations by improving variance estimation, the fundamental issue of limited control samples persists, necessitating larger, well-characterized normal tissue cohorts to enhance statistical robustness and ensure more reliable biomarker identification. The therapeutic landscape for ovarian cancer increasingly emphasizes combination strategies, suggesting that Naringin’s clinical potential may be best realized through rational drug combinations with established platinum-based regimens, PARP inhibitors, or emerging immunotherapeutic approaches to unlock enhanced therapeutic efficacy while potentially mitigating resistance mechanisms. Naringin’s suboptimal predicted oral bioavailability presents a significant translational challenge that could be addressed through advanced pharmaceutical approaches, including nanoformulation strategies, prodrug development, or targeted delivery systems to bridge the substantial gap between computational promise and clinical implementation. The integration of comprehensive molecular profiling platforms offers opportunities for precision medicine approaches, enabling treatment stratification based on tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic signatures. The transition from computational modeling to clinical application demands a systematic translational research program encompassing rigorous preclinical validation, optimized pharmaceutical development, and carefully designed clinical trials—coordinated efforts that will be essential for realizing Naringin’s therapeutic potential in the challenging landscape of ovarian cancer treatment.
