Introduction Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the principal forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are showing a rising global prevalence, affecting an estimated 7 million individuals and placing a substantial strain on healthcare systems [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Despite advances in therapy, approximately one-third of patients with IBD exhibit primary non-response, and nearly half experience secondary loss of response [ 10 11 12 13 14 1.1. IBD and CVD: A Shared Pathogenesis IBD arises from a multifaceted interaction of genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, environmental exposures, and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota—culminating in heightened cytokine activity [ 3 4 7 8 12 Emerging evidence points to shared pathophysiological mechanisms between IBD and CVD, including genetic overlap (e.g., NOD2 CDKN2B stromelysin ApoE 15 16 17 Although the SCORE2 model developed by the European Society of Cardiology remains the prevailing tool for CV risk estimation, it has not been extensively validated in IBD populations and does not account for the heightened inflammatory burden, unlike the 1.5 correction factor applied in rheumatoid arthritis [ 18 1.2. Risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multiple studies have demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of MACEs in IBD populations, with increases ranging from 25% to 300% compared with matched controls. A pivotal study by Bernstein et al. involving over 88,000 participants (8072 with IBD) reported an elevated incidence rate ratio (IRR) for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in patients with IBD (IRR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.11–1.44) [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 25 26 24 25 26 27 1.3. Impact of IBD Treatments on Cardiovascular Risk Certain IBD treatments, particularly corticosteroids, may worsen cardiovascular profiles by inducing hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia [ 28 p 20 TNF-α inhibitors may provide cardiovascular protection [ 29 30 Data on the cardiovascular safety of newer biological therapies available, such as vedolizumab, ustekinumab, mirikizumab, and risankizumab, remain limited; however, no concerning safety signals related to AAEs have been identified thus far. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, including tofacitinib, filgotinib, and upadacitinib, are among the most recent agents approved for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and, in the case of upadacitinib, also Crohn’s disease. Clinical trials have noted reversible elevations in serum lipids, including total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, during early treatment with tofacitinib [ 31 32 Based on recommendations from the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), has advised limiting the use of JAK inhibitors in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, reserving them for cases with no appropriate alternatives. Nonetheless, a meta-analysis reviewing the safety of JAK inhibitors across IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) reported 30 studies assessing MACEs in 32,765 treated individuals (17 on tofacitinib, 6 on upadacitinib, 4 on baricitinib, and 3 on filgotinib), with a pooled incidence rate of 0.67 per 100 patient-years. The relative risk of MACEs was estimated at 1.07 (95% CI: 0.56–2.03) in the analysis of 22 controlled trials [ 33 The following tables illustrate – Established cardiovascular risk factors ( Table 1 – Shared biological mechanisms that may drive IBD and cardiovascular disease ( Table 1 – Treatment-related cardiovascular risks ( Table 2 – Summary of key studies conducted on this topic ( Appendix A 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 jpm-15-00418-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Risk factors for IBD and cardiovascular diseases.

IBD and MACEs: Risk Prediction There remains a critical need for robust assessment of MACE incidence in IBD, therapy-related risks and benefits, lifestyle influences, and disease activity ( Appendix A 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 1.5. Dissecting the Complexity of CV Risk in IBD Patients As summarized in the previous sections, there is still an unmet need to evaluate the real amount of CV risk in patients with IBD because of the lack of prospective trials, and the limitation of the available CV risk scores designed for an older background population compared to the patients with IBD. In addition, there is a lack of a systematic evaluation of other possible shared risk factors, such as genetic polymorphisms or dysbiosis, and more importantly, the need to evaluate the full systematic dataset with a hypothesis-free powerful methodology, such as AI-driven algorithms. For these reasons, an ongoing study designed to overcome these limitations is described here. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population Our first aim was to prospectively enroll a large cohort of IBD patients in the Unit of Gastroenterology of the Research Hospital San Donato Policlinic, San Donato Milanese (Mi), for 1 year to be compared with an age/gender-matched cohort under follow-up at the Unit of Cardiology of the same Institution. To this end, a set of specialized, privacy-preserving large language models (LLMs), coordinated by an agentic framework provided by Agora Labs [ 72 3 4 3 4 NCT07095634 The control cohort will be that of the CV-PREVITAL trial (a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label interventional trial— NCT05339841 2.2. Multi-Omics Evaluation The second aim is to undertake an extensive multi-omics, metabolic, and histological evaluation. Genomics 73 Transcriptomics: 74 Metagenomics: 75 Proteomics 76 Metabolic evaluation Histology 77 2.3. Prospective Evaluation At the end of the 2-year follow-up, all patients in the IBD cohorts and the control population will be re-evaluated in terms of CVD risk using SCORE 2, the standard laboratory and cardiologic investigations will be repeated, and the occurrence of new MACEs will be reported. All patients with IBD will be regularly evaluated during the follow-up at 3–6 month intervals, and all will receive a clinical, endoscopic, and histologic evaluation at the end of follow-up. The subgroup of patients with the occurrence of MACEs and those with clinical and endoscopic remission will also repeat the transcriptomics and metagenomics evaluation. 2.4. Objectives of the Study The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate the basal CVD risk in our IBD population compared with the age- and gender-matched cohort of non-IBD patients. The secondary objectives will be as follows: – Correlation of the basal CVD risk with multi-omics biomarkers, disease activity, lifestyle (i.e., diet, smoking) and therapy; – To evaluate the occurrence of MACEs at the end of follow-up in the patients with IBD and control populations; – To investigate the possible correlation between high CVD risk and MACE occurrence with multi-omics findings; – To identify possible biomarkers of increased CVD risk compared with the control population; – To establish possible correction factors to apply to the standard traditional CVD risk score to incorporate the IBD inflammatory burden. 2.5. Statistical Analysis In this study, a combination of descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be required to ensure robust analysis. For descriptive statistics of the key characteristics of the study (CD, UC, and matched controls), we used the mean and standard deviation (for continuous variables such as age and BMI), median and interquartile range (for skewed variables), and counts and percentages (for categorical variables, such as sex and smoking status). To check the balance between the groups, the standardized mean differences (SMDs) will assess the balance of covariates between the groups. An SMD < 0.1 typically indicates good balance. t The power of our sample was estimated by Cohen’s h effect size for proportions based on different hypotheses about the annual incidence rate of main MACEs in Italy (ISTAT—National Institute of Statistics), a range from 1% to 5% per year, and the estimated increase in cardiovascular events in the Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis groups, a range from 1.25 (25% increase) to 3.5 (250% increase). Under the assumption of an incidence rate of 1% per year in the control population, a sample size of 300 patients with IBD (CD and UC) and 300 matched controls will have 80% power to detect an HR of 2.5 or greater. Under the assumption of an incidence rate of 5% per year, there will be approximately 80% power to detect a hazard ratio equal to 1.6. The recruitment period was set to 1 year with 4 years of follow-up (2 years retrospective and 2 years prospective) for a total duration of 5 years. The significance level was set at 5%. A dropout of 5% in both groups is assumed. Effect size parameters: Follow-up period of 3 years retrospectively and 2 years prospectively; alpha (α) of 0.05 (standard significance level); power (1—β) of 90%. For genomics, logistic regression and generalized linear models will be used for association analyses between the identified genetic variants and clinical outcomes, adjusting for confounders, such as age, sex, and disease duration. Transcriptome data will be analyzed for differential expression patterns, with statistical significance assessed through empirical Bayes methods, followed by pathway enrichment analysis using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and functional network mapping through tools such as STRING (consortium 2024) or Cytoscape (ver. 3.10.3). Microbiome data will undergo community profiling through alpha and beta diversity metrics, and associations with clinical endpoints will be tested via multivariate analysis methods, such as canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Furthermore, metagenomic functional profiles will be reconstructed using PICRUSt2 or HUMAnN3, allowing for functional comparison across patient subgroups. Integration across omics layers will be realized through data integration analysis for biomarker discovery using latent components (DIABLO) and complemented by machine learning-driven feature selection techniques (e.g., LASSO, elastic-net). Targeted proteomics will be analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s for a multiple comparison test. To evaluate the concordance of histological evaluation (active/remission) of different scoring system and Claudin 2 immunostaining, Cohen’s kappa (k) will be evaluated. In addition, to carry out the systematic evaluation of the large, multidimensional dataset, overcoming the limitation of sample size and length of follow-up, and to detect unexpected pathogenetic hypotheses and biomarkers, an artificial intelligence model will be implemented [ 78 ® 3. Results No solid results of the ongoing study are given; only the status of recruitment at the time of writing is reported. In total, 167 patients with IBD have been enrolled with detailed phenotyping and bio-sampling. 3.1. Characteristics of the IBD Study Population The main characteristics of the IBD study population are depicted in Supplementary Table S1 3.2. Characteristics of the Control Population Table 3 4. Discussion The precise mechanisms responsible for the development of cardiovascular events in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain incompletely defined [ 7 8 12 8 3 4 Appendix A At present, there are no specific, validated guidelines for cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with IBD. Many IBD patients are younger adults who fall outside the demographic typically assessed by conventional cardiovascular risk calculators. Nevertheless, the 2019 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology recognized IBD—alongside conditions such as cancer therapies, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus—as requiring heightened vigilance in screening, counseling, and management for atherosclerotic disease [ 79 18 A multidisciplinary approach is essential for appropriately addressing the interplay between IBD and cardiovascular risk. Beyond early detection and effective treatment, secondary prevention should be prioritized. In this context, recommendations from the American Heart Association support strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risk in patients with IBD, emphasizing the maintenance of disease remission as a key factor in reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk [ 11 11 Several limitations still exist in fully understanding the IBD–CVD relationship, particularly with regard to therapeutic effects, biological pathways, and the availability of laboratory tools, such as biomarkers, that could help anticipate cardiovascular risk and pathogenesis. Traditional risk calculators, such as SCORE2, likely underestimate CVD risk in patients with IBD. As seen in rheumatoid arthritis, a correction factor of 1.5 is recommended to account for the persistent inflammatory burden; a similar adjustment may be warranted in patients with IBD [ 18 Our study will provide a comprehensive analysis of how disease activity, treatment regimens, and multi-omics profiles influence cardiovascular risk. This approach may help identify common risk pathways and open new prevention and management avenues. At the moment, we have only reported the status of recruitment in Section 3 In Italy, there are currently an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 patients with IBD, with projections indicating a possible doubling over the next decade [ 1 Upon completion of the study, we aim to propose an IBD-specific correction factor to enhance the accuracy of existing CV risk scoring systems. This will be particularly valuable for younger patients—especially those under 40 years—who are not adequately captured by current tools. Indeed, this subgroup appears to show a more pronounced disparity in MACE incidence compared to the general population. Notably, this will be the first prospective investigation in Italy specifically designed to evaluate CVD risk in patients with IBD and one of only a few worldwide [ 43 5. Conclusions The exact underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular events in IBD remain poorly understood. More research is required to elucidate the complex interplay between inflammation, immune dysregulation, and CVD pathogenesis in IBD, which encompasses a spectrum of diseases with varying clinical phenotypes and courses. More studies are needed to understand these nuances and to guide targeted interventions. Existing studies primarily rely on observational or retrospective data, making it difficult to establish definite causal relationships between specific factors and CVD development. In this study, all consecutive patients with IBD will be evaluated for their basal SCORE 2 and complete disease characteristics and will undergo screening cardiologic investigations to assess potential cardiovascular issues. Following at least 2 years of follow-up, the whole cardiologic and gastroenterological assessment will be repeated, and the occurrence of MACEs will be investigated and correlated with the multi-omics assessment and control cohort. This in-depth evaluation will potentially reveal unexpected and silent underlying high risks for MACEs and direct the subjects, under the control of a cardiologist, to make significant changes in their lifestyle, diet, and therapy. More importantly, the multi-omics evaluation may reveal biomarkers of increased CV risk and suggest corrective factors for the standard CV risk score in this patient population.
