Introduction Free-living amoebae of the genus Naegleria Naegleria fowleri Naegleria N. fowleri 1 2 3 4 Early PAM symptoms resemble viral or bacterial meningitis, headache, fever, nausea, stiff neck, progressing rapidly to confusion, seizures, coma, and death. Because they are nonspecific, diagnosis is often delayed, lowering survival chances. Treatment options are very limited: even with early use of amphotericin B or miltefosine, outcomes are rarely successful due to low efficacy and severe side effects. Despite increasing research efforts, major knowledge gaps in PAM biology, pathogenesis, and control remain. These gaps are due to the disease’s rarity, the rapid progression and high fatality that limit the availability of clinical samples, the difficulty of maintaining reliable in vitro and in vivo infection models, and the limited funding typically available for rare diseases [ 3 4 5 6 5 6 N. fowleri 6 7 8 9 10 Nature has long inspired major advances in healthcare [ 11 12 12 13 14 Mentha 15 Mentha 16 Mentha 17 18 Mentha rotundifolia 19 20 21 22 23 M. rotundifolia Naegleria Continuing our research on discovering novel amoebicidal agents, we report herein the isolation of ursolic acid ( 1 M. rotundifolia N. fowleri 2 11 7 10 2. Results 2.1. Bioassay-Guided Isolation The objective of the present study was to conduct bioprospecting of M. rotundifolia M. rotundifolia N. fowleri ® TM 50 50 Figure 1 Table 1 The results showed that the hexanic extract exhibited the most potent amoebicidal profile, with an IC 50 N. fowleri ® Figure 2 Table 1 Fraction M4 showed the most promising anti-amoebic activity with an IC 50 N. fowleri ® Figure 2 50 1 24 50 N. fowleri ® To our knowledge, ursolic acid is an amoebicidal agent, underscoring its potential as a promising therapeutic compound. This naturally occurring triterpene has demonstrated significant efficacy against N. fowleri Balamuthia mandrillaris 25 2.2. Chemical Modification A comprehensive approach was conducted to optimize ursolic acid as a lead compound, aiming to gain insights into the structure–activity relationships (SARs) of this pentacyclic triterpenoid as a potential amoebicidal agent. To enable rational structural modification, the UA molecule has been analyzed in terms of its functional groups and pharmacophores, which are critical for its biological activity. These sites are broadly categorized as the carboxylic moiety (C-28), hydroxy function (C-3), and an alkene at C-12/C-13. The present study was focused on UA derivatives modified at C-3 and C-28 positions. Firstly, methyl ursolate ( 2 1 2 3 6 7 8 Figure 3 Figure 4 O 3 9 10 11 Figure 5 5 11 2 26 3 27 4 28 Supporting Information, pages S2–S12 2.3.

The results ( Figure 9 7 10 Figure 9 Figure 9 7 Figure 9 10 Figure 9 10 Figure 9 N. fowleri p p In addition, the impact on mitochondrial function was further supported by the analysis of intracellular ATP levels. As shown in Figure 10 7 10 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key indicators of cellular stress, as their accumulation disrupts cellular homeostasis and triggers cell death pathways [ 31 Figure 11 N. fowleri Figure 11 Figure 11 Figure 11 7 ® p 10 ® p Moreover, autophagy represents an additional programmed cell death (PCD) pathway that has recently been reported in several parasites, including N. fowleri 8 7 Figure 12 10 Figure 12 Figure 12 Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that trophozoites treated with the compounds exhibited a pronounced disruption of actin organization, evidenced by a significant reduction in fluorescence intensity compared to the negative controls ( Figure 13 32 3. Discussion Medicinal plants remain a promising source of bioactive compounds for the discovery and development of new antiparasitic agents [ 33 Mentha rotundifolia 34 35 N. fowleri 7 10 36 32 ® ® The cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape, motility, intracellular transport, and overall structural integrity. In pathogenic protozoa, it is also essential for adhesion, migration, and host invasion. Given its central role in parasite viability and infectivity, the cytoskeleton represents a promising therapeutic target for antiparasitic drug development. In this context, phalloidin-TRITC staining revealed significant disruption of the actin cytoskeleton following treatment, including filament disassembly and actin cluster formation, suggesting that actin structures may represent a direct molecular target of these compounds. Furthermore, treated cells exhibited marked morphological alterations, such as cell shrinkage and reduced volume, indicative of compromised cytoskeletal integrity [ 32 N. fowleri Naegleria 8 32 Observed apoptotic and autophagy-like responses in N. fowleri 37 38 Trypanosoma Leishmania 38 39 40 41 41 42 Leishmania Trypanosoma N. fowleri N. fowleri 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. General Procedures Bruker Avance 500 and 600 spectrometers were employed for the acquisition of 1D and 2D NMR spectra (Bruker, Wissembourg, France). Chemical shifts were reported in δ (ppm), while coupling constants were expressed in Hz, with reference to the residual deuterated solvent (CDCl 3 H C 2 2 4 1 4.2. Plant Material Leaves of Mentha rotundifolia 4.3. Dried of Vegetal Material The leaves were dried, shielded from light, and kept at room temperature (19–22 °C) for two weeks; then the plant material was ground into a fine powder using an electric herb grinder (particles size: 10-120 mesh). 4.4. Extracts Preparation The air-dried and powdered leaves of M. rotundifolia M. rotundifolia 4.5. Bioactivity-Guided Chromatographic Fractionation and Isolation The hexanes extract (96.7 g) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, using hexanes/EtOAc mixtures of increasing polarity (from 9:1 to 0:10) as eluents to afford six fractions, which were combined based on their TLC profile in fractions M1-M4. Amoebicidal activity tests revealed that fraction M4 was active against the tested parasites. This fraction (7.1 g) was further fractioned by polarity chromatography on silica gel using hexanes/EtOAc (6:4 to 4:6) as eluent, affording six sub-fractions, which were combined based on their TLC profiles in five sub-fractions designated M4A-M4E. Sub-fractions M4B and M4C were further divided into two sub-fractions, each by precipitation using ethyl acetate as a solvent. The resulting supernates (M4B1 and M4C1) and the solid (M4B2 and M4C2) were dried and tested against the parasites, revealing that the solid sub-fractions were the most active. The active sub-fraction M4B2 was then purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC) to yield ursolic acid. The structure characterization of the isolated compound was carried out by analysis of NMR spectroscopic data ( Supporting Information, pages S2–S12 24 4.6.

Mechanism of Action on N. fowleri Trophozoites for Compounds 7 and 10 4.8.1. Analysis of Programmed Cell Death To evaluate the induction of PCD, N. fowleri ® ® 90 7 10 4.8.2. Analysis of Chromatin Condensation To evaluate the chromatin condensation, cells were stained with Hoechst 33,342 (1 µM) and propidium iodide (PI) (1 µM) for 20 min in the dark. Hoechst 33,342 binds to condensed chromatin in apoptotic cells and emits blue fluorescence, while PI enters cells with compromised membranes, indicative of late apoptosis or necrosis, and binds to DNA, emitting red fluorescence. This dual-staining approach allowed the differentiation of three cell populations: viable cells, which emitted faint blue fluorescence (Hoechst 33,342); apoptotic cells, characterized by bright blue fluorescence indicating chromatin condensation; and dead cells, which displayed red fluorescence (PI) due to membrane disruption. Untreated cells were included as negative controls to establish baseline fluorescence levels [ 30 4.8.3. Analysis of Plasma Membrane Permeability After treatment, SYTOX™ Green nucleic acid stain (Life Technologies, Madrid, Spain) was added to each well at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL and incubated for 15 min in the dark. SYTOX™ Green selectively penetrates cells with damaged membranes, binding to nucleic acids and emitting bright green fluorescence. In contrast, viable cells with intact membranes exclude the dye and remain non-fluorescent. Untreated trophozoites were used as negative controls [ 10 4.8.4. Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assessed using the JC-1 dye (1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloroimidacarbocyanine iodide; Cayman Chemical, Madrid); following treatment, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in JC-1 assay buffer. A total of 10 μL of JC-1 dye was added to each well, and the plates were incubated in the dark for 20-30 min. The JC-1 dye accumulates in mitochondria in a potential-dependent manner. In healthy cells, with intact mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), JC-1 forms red fluorescent J-aggregates (emission at ~595 nm). In cells with depolarized mitochondria, JC-1 remains in its monomeric form, emitting green fluorescence (emission at ~535 nm), indicating mitochondrial damage and a loss of ΔΨm [ 10 4.8.5. Measurement of Intracellular Adenosine Triphosphate Levels Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production was quantified using the CellTiter-Glo ® ® 30 4.8.6. Measurement of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Levels The oxidative stress induced by the generation of ROS in N. fowleri ® 30 4.8.7. Detection of Autophagic Vacuole Formation Autophagy is a vital cellular process involved in the degradation and recycling of intracellular components, often activated in response to drug exposure. To evaluate autophagic activity, trophozoites were stained with monodansylcadaverine (MDC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) during 30 min in the dark. This is a fluorescent dye that selectively accumulates in autophagic vacuoles due to its ion-trapping properties and affinity for membrane lipids. After treatment, cells were incubated with MDC. The dye emits a characteristic cyan-blue fluorescence, allowing the detection and qualitative analysis of autophagic vacuoles in treated cells [ 32 4.8.8. Analysis of Cytoskeletal Integrity Cytoskeletal disruption in treated amoebae was evaluated by staining with phalloidin conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (phalloidin- TRITC), which binds specifically to filamentous actin, emitting red fluorescence. DAPI staining was used in parallel to visualize nuclear DNA, emitting blue fluorescence. After treatment, cells were fixed with formaldehyde on coverslips, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min. Following washing with PBS, fluorescence images were captured with a 63x oil immersion objective [ 44 4.8.9. Statistical Analysis All in vitro experiments were conducted across three independent assays ( n p 5.
