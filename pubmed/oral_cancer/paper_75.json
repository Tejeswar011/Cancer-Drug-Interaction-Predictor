Despite significant advances in understanding its immunopathogenesis, current immunotherapies remain limited in their ability to halt disease progression, making multiple sclerosis incurable and highlighting the critical need for novel therapeutic strategies. Antigen-specific immunotherapy represents a groundbreaking approach that aims to restore immune tolerance to myelin-derived antigens while preserving the protective functions of the immune system. Unlike broad immunosuppressive strategies, antigen-specific immunotherapy offers the potential for highly targeted modulation of pathogenic immune responses, reducing off-target effects and enhancing safety profiles. Over the last two decades, preclinical studies and clinical trials have explored diverse antigen-specific immunotherapy modalities, ranging from peptide-based vaccines to nanoparticle platforms, each aimed at achieving durable tolerance in multiple sclerosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis, covering its etiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, pathology, and current therapeutic approaches. Thus, it delves into the current state of antigen-specific immunotherapy research, critically examining its successes and limitations while addressing the translational challenges that must be overcome to realize its therapeutic potential. By integrating insights from immunology, biotechnology, and translational medicine, we propose directions for advancing antigen-specific approaches in the quest for transformative multiple sclerosis therapies.

Indeed, this biomarker has been incorporated into the McDonald criteria as an alternative criterion for dissemination in time (DIT) when MRI criteria are not met. 18 21 Although not yet formally included in the diagnostic criteria, other paraclinical tests, such as visual evoked potentials (VEPs), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and optical coherence tomography (OCT), can further support MS diagnosis. 22 18 23 In the following sections, we describe in more detail the characteristic clinical, imaging and laboratory findings of MS. Table 1 Table 1 Typical and atypical (“Red Flags”) characteristics in multiple sclerosis Feature Typical MS characteristics Atypical (“red flags”) characteristics Clinical Subacute onset Unilateral optic neuritis Incomplete spinal cord syndrome Internuclear ophthalmoplegia Hyperacute or chronic onset Bilateral severe optic neuritis Complete transverse myelitis Encephalopathy, headache Persistent nausea, vomiting or hiccups Prominent ophthalmoplegia MRI Oval-shaped lesions Periventricular (Dawson’s fingers) Inferotemporal location Juxtacortical involving U-fibers Partial myelitis Central vein sign Chronic “black holes”, slowly expanding lesions (SELs) Nodular or “open-ring” enhancement Large tumefactive, ill-defined lesions Longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions (≥3 vertebral segments) Prominent cortical involvement Leptomeningeal enhancement, persistent enhancement CSF CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, elevated KFLC, and elevated IgG index Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis Marked pleocytosis (> 50 cells/mm 3 Hypoglycorrhachia Absence or transient CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands MS MRI CSF KFLC Clinical features MS typically presents with episodes of neurological dysfunction (relapses) in the absence of fever or concomitant infectious events and is characterized by diverse symptoms depending on the location of the demyelinating lesions within the CNS. 24 25 26 27 28 Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction are common among MS patients but should not be considered relapses if presented in isolation. 29 30 1 31 MRI features The inclusion of MRI in the McDonald criteria was a milestone in MS diagnosis. In addition to diagnosis, MRI plays a critical role in monitoring disease activity. Typically, MS lesions appear as oval or round hyperintense areas on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences in the white matter, generally ranging from 3 mm to several centimeters in diameter, with demarcated margins. The four typical locations that are included in the diagnostic criteria are the periventricular, juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord. The inclusion of the optic nerve as the fifth topography to fulfill MS criteria has been proposed by a panel of experts, but it has not yet been published. 22 32 33 34 1 35 36 Notably, two radiological signs have been proposed as supporting features for the diagnosis of MS because of their high specificity: the central vein sign (CVS) and the presence of paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs). 32 37 38 Laboratory findings Laboratory investigations aid in the diagnosis of MS, although no single test is diagnostic by itself, CSF analysis frequently reveals OCBs in the CSF but not in the serum, indicating intrathecal antibody production. While OCBs are present in as many as 90% of MS patients, they are not specific to the disease and can also appear in other conditions, such as neurosarcoidosis, vasculitis, and Behçet disease. An elevated IgG index and mild pleocytosis with lymphocytic predominance may also be observed, whereas the presence of more than 50 cells/mm 3 1 17 39 40 43 32 44 45 Diagnostic criteria The diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) relies primarily on demonstrating dissemination in space (DIS) and DIT, as defined in the 2017 revised McDonald criteria. DIS is established by the presence of lesions in at least two of the four classical CNS regions: the periventricular, juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord regions. DIT can be demonstrated through clinical relapses or by MRI findings, such as the coexistence of enhancing and nonenhancing lesions or the appearance of new T2 lesions on follow-up scans. In patients with a single clinical event and evidence of DIS, CSF-specific OCBs may replace DIT. The diagnosis of primary progressive MS (PPMS) requires one year of clinical progression plus at least two of three supportive criteria (Table 2 18 Table 2 McDonald 2017 diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis Category Diagnostic criteria Dissemination in space (DIS) ≥2 clinical attacks with objective evidence of ≥2 lesions OR MRI lesions in ≥2 characteristic CNS regions: - Periventricular - Cortical/Juxtacortical - Infratentorial - Spinal cord Dissemination in time (DIT) ≥2 clinical attacks separated by ≥1 month OR MRI evidence of the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions OR New T2 lesions appearing on follow-up MRI OR Presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands (in patients with clinical and radiological evidence of DIS) Diagnosis of RRMS Evidence of both DIS and DIT demonstrated clinically, via MRI, or with supportive CSF findings (oligoclonal bands) Diagnosis of PPMS ≥1 year of disability progression independent of clinical relapses PLUS 2 of the following: -≥1 T2-hyperintense lesions characteristic of MS in periventricular, cortical/juxtacortical, or infratentorial regions -≥2 T2-hyperintense spinal cord lesions -Presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands MRI CNS CSF RRMS PPMS DIS DIT In 2024, an international panel of experts proposed updated diagnostic criteria for MS, aiming to increase diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time to diagnosis. Although not yet formally published, these proposed 2024 McDonald criteria include several major changes: (1) the possibility of diagnosing radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) as MS in specific high-risk scenarios; (2) formal inclusion of the optic nerve as a fifth CNS region for assessing DIS; (3) elimination of the requirement for DIT in selected cases; (4) acceptance of CSF KFLC as an alternative to OCBs to establish intrathecal inflammation and fulfill DIT; and (5) incorporation of advanced MRI biomarkers, such as CVS and PRLs, as supportive features to improve specificity. These refinements are especially relevant in atypical presentations and in special populations, such as patients over 50 years of age or those with headache or vascular comorbidities, where diagnostic uncertainty may be greater. Clinical phenotypes MS phenotypes are traditionally classified on the basis of clinical progression and disease activity, with the most common form being RRMS, which is characterized by clearly defined relapses with full or partial recovery and stable periods between episodes. Approximately 50–80% of these patients develop secondary progressive MS (SPMS), which is characterized by gradual worsening of neurological function, within an average period of 15–20 years after disease onset. 28 46 28 47 48 49 50 RIS refers to the incidental discovery of MRI findings suggestive of MS in individuals without clinical symptoms or signs consistent with demyelination. Individuals with RIS have an increased risk of developing CIS or definite MS over time. Factors predicting a greater risk of progression from RIS to symptomatic MS include spinal cord and infratentorial lesions and the presence of OCBs. The management of RISs remains an area of ongoing research, focusing primarily on monitoring and identifying high-risk individuals who might benefit from early intervention. 51 Despite these classifications, some experts have encouraged neurologists to understand the disease as a continuum defined by the relative contributions of overlapping pathological and reparative/compensatory processes, which may vary across individuals and over time. 52 Another clinically relevant phenotype, although defined by age of onset rather than disease course, is pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS). POMS is a rare but increasingly recognized chronic, immune-mediated demyelinating disorder of the CNS that presents before the age of 18. It accounts for approximately 3–5% of all MS cases and shares core pathological features with adult-onset MS (AOMS), including multifocal inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, and neurodegeneration. 53 54 55 54 Notably, cognitive impairment, which affects domains such as processing speed, working memory, and executive function, is more prevalent in POMS patients. These deficits are attributed to both inflammatory demyelination and disrupted neurodevelopmental trajectories, particularly when disease onset occurs during critical periods of brain maturation. 56 57 The diagnosis of POMS is based on the 2017 McDonald criteria, with adaptations validated for pediatric use. It requires evidence of DIT and DIS on MRI and is often supported by CSF findings such as the presence of OCBs. Importantly, alternative diagnoses that are relatively more frequent in younger children, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), or genetic and metabolic leukoencephalopathies, must be carefully ruled out through clinical, radiologic, and serological assessment. 58 60 32 61 The management of POMS involves both acute relapse treatment and long-term disease modification. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids remain the first-line therapy for acute exacerbations. Disease modifying treatments (DMTs) constitute the cornerstone of long-term management, with first-line agents including interferon (IFN)-β and glatiramer acetate. More recently, fingolimod became the first DMT approved specifically for pediatric MS in patients aged ≥10 years, following the PARADIGMS trial. 62 63 64 Pathology and pathogenesis The pathology of MS is characterized by multifocal areas of inflammation, demyelination and gliosis within the white and gray matter of the brain and spinal cord, known as plaques or lesions. The loss of myelin sheaths disrupts neuronal function and impairs nerve signal transmission. 65 + + 66 67 68 The etiology of MS remains elusive. In fact, many genetic and environmental factors are associated with MS development (see below). The pathogenesis of MS has also not been fully elucidated; however, both innate and adaptive immune responses are known to be involved. MS is driven primarily by autoreactive adaptive immune cells that infiltrate and promote damage within the CNS. Dysregulation of immune effector–suppressor cell interactions results in an autoimmune response against CNS antigens. 69 + 70 76 77 79 80 81 82 85 Etiology and hypotheses on MS pathogenesis While the specific etiology of MS remains elusive, its pathogenesis is clearly multifactorial and involves complex interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental influences (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 The interplay of genetic, environmental, and epigenetic factors in multiple sclerosis risk. Multiple sclerosis (MS) risk is influenced by the interaction of genetic susceptibility, environmental exposure, and epigenetic modifications. This Venn diagram illustrates how these three factors overlap, with MS emerging at their intersection. Genetics (pink) contributes to inherited susceptibility, with variations in immune-related genes playing a key role. Environmental factors (blue), such as infections, vitamin D levels, and smoking, can affect disease risk. Epigenetics (green) represents the dynamic regulatory mechanisms that mediate the effects of the environment on gene expression, shaping immune responses and disease progression. The surrounding bubbles represent the contributions of individual factors and their interplay, emphasizing the multifactorial nature of MS pathogenesis. Created in https://BioRender.com In that sense, a recent meta-analysis using Canadian MS data developed a probabilistic model to infer the effect that the different factors have on the probability of developing MS, focusing on the likelihood that a randomly selected individual from the genetically susceptible population experiences an event that is, by itself, “sufficient” to trigger the disease. Interestingly, the results of this study suggest that MS development requires both an appropriate genetic background and a “sufficient” level of environmental exposure. However, even when both factors are present, MS may still not manifest. 15 Genetic factors Currently, the genetic component of MS risk is strongly supported by familiar and twin studies. For example, the lifetime risk of developing MS in the general population is approximately 0.1%, whereas in individuals with a first-degree relative affected by MS, it ranges between 2% and 4%. 86 87 Over the past 20 years, extensive research (primarily through large genome-wide association studies [GWASs]) has greatly advanced our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of MS. These studies have highlighted the crucial role of genes involved in the adaptive immune system at MS onset, particularly those influencing T-cell function. The most well-established genetic association with MS involves the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region, particularly the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele. 88 86 89 Until 2019, MS genetics focused predominantly on identifying susceptibility variants associated with the development of the disease. As a result, we now understand 48% of its inheritability. 89 90 Among the more than 230 genetic variants associated with MS risk identified over the years via GWAS, most appear to be related or directly linked to immune system function 91 92 Functionally, these non-HLA risk loci can be categorized on the basis of their roles in MS pathogenesis. Several variants are associated with T-cell activation, cytokine signaling, and antigen presentation, affecting genes such as interleukin (IL)-2RA, IL17R, 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 90 101 102 Notably, most of these genetic risk factors are enriched across all major immune cell types, but some of them exert opposing effects depending on the immune cell type in which they are expressed, highlighting the complexity of MS pathogenesis. 103 Notably, in most genetic screenings, samples were collected in Europe and the USA, and it is important to acknowledge that MS genetics differ among populations. While it is likely that the majority of genetic risk factors are shared, as has been observed between European/American populations and African Americans, 104 106 In summary, genetic studies have revealed that the onset of MS is driven primarily by immunological mechanisms predominantly in the adaptive arm of the immune system, whereas disease progression appears to be influenced by processes in the CNS. Nevertheless, all these insights set the stage for further functional studies, aiming to uncover the underpinnings of MS disease, paving the way for novel prevention strategies and personalized treatment on the basis of the diversity of genetic profiles of patients. Environmental triggers While genetic predisposition plays a significant role in MS susceptibility, the disease does not follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern, as evidenced by its incomplete concordance among monozygotic twins and the influence of multiple low-effect genetic variants. These findings indicate that environmental exposure is a critical contributor to MS pathogenesis. Over the years, several epidemiological studies have provided compelling evidence that various environmental factors interact with genetic susceptibility to influence disease risk. Large multinational efforts, such as the Environmental Risk Factors in MS Study (EnvIMS), 107 108 109 110 111 One of the oldest and most well-documented observations is the latitudinal gradient of MS incidence, with higher disease incidence in populations residing at greater distances from the equator, which led, over 50 years ago, to a link being drawn with variation in levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). 112 Higher vitamin D levels, particularly before the age of 20, have been associated with a lower risk of developing MS later in life, 113 111 114 115 Genetic studies further support the role of vitamin D in MS. Polymorphisms near CYP27B1, a key enzyme in vitamin D metabolism, have been linked to an increased risk of the disease. 116 117 118 119 Vitamin D has also been linked to MS progression and neurodegeneration. The administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the EAE model has demonstrated evidence of slowing disability progression. Notably, progression was even prevented, and upon re-exposure following vitamin D withdrawal, the effects suggested a reversible block of disability, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in MS. 118 119 120 121 From a pathogenic perspective, vitamin D is a key modulator of immune function, and its deficiency has been implicated in immune dysregulation, facilitating MS development via a decrease in the differentiation of effector T and B cells, the promotion of regulatory subsets, the modulation of innate immune cells and a reduction in immune cell trafficking that acts at the BBB. 122 123 124 125 Interestingly, more than 80% of known MS-associated genes are enriched in vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in their promoter regions and, consequently, may be regulated by vitamin D. 126 128 129 130 Infectious agents have also been proposed as environmental triggers of MS, with EBV emerging as one of the most studied candidates. EBV has been implicated in the development of MS, with recent research showing that nearly all individuals who developed MS were EBV positive at the time of onset. A longitudinal study involving 801 MS patients from over 10 million U.S. military personnel reported that all but one had contracted EBV before developing MS, providing strong evidence that EBV is a trigger for the disease. 131 The mechanisms by which EBV influences MS, which have been recently extensively reviewed, 132 133 134 135 136 136 Other infections, including human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), have been investigated for their potential roles in MS. HHV-6 is highly prevalent and can establish lifelong infection early in life. Meta-analyses and case‒control studies suggest an association between HHV-6 infection and increased MS risk. 137 138 139 140 141 142 144 137 Smoking has also been associated with an increased risk of MS, likely owing to its effects on immune activation and chronic inflammation. A substantial body of high-quality evidence consistently links active tobacco smoking to a greater risk of MS onset, 145 146 146 147 Beyond onset risk, numerous studies have investigated the link between smoking and MS progression, although the findings are not entirely consistent. Evidence suggests that smoking accelerates the transition from RRMS to SPMS and worsens disability progression, as demonstrated in case‒control and cohort studies across different populations. 148 Mechanistically, smoking may contribute to MS progression through oxidative stress, nitric oxide-induced axonal degeneration, increased BBB permeability, and chronic immune activation. 149 150 151 In addition, nutritional factors have emerged as key modulators of MS risk and progression, with increasing evidence highlighting the impact of diet on immune regulation, neuroinflammation, and the gut microbiome composition. 152 155 Obesity, particularly in early life, has been linked to increased MS risk and neuroinflammation, largely through adipokine-induced immune modulation and vitamin D deficiency. 156 159 160 161 162 164 In contrast, dietary interventions such as the ketogenic diet and caloric restriction have shown promise in experimental models and clinical trials by modulating immune responses, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting neuroprotection. 165 168 169 170 Additionally, the gut microbiome, which is shaped by dietary habits, has gained attention for its role in regulating immune tolerance and influencing MS susceptibility. 171 173 Blautia Akkermansia Bifidobacterium Akkermansia 174 Another recent meta-analysis highlighted a common gut microbiome alteration across autoimmune neurological diseases, including MS, characterized by a reduction in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (such as Faecalibacterium Roseburia Streptococcus 172 175 176 + 177 Hypotheses on MS etiology: inside-out vs. outside-in While MS pathogenesis remains a topic of debate, two predominant paradigms, the “outside-in” and “inside-out” hypotheses, have shaped the discussion of MS origins for years. 178 179 From a genetic point of view, the results indicate that the majority of MS risk loci are associated with immune system function, 180 181 From a phenotypic perspective, while RRMS appears to be largely driven by peripheral immune responses targeting the CNS, progressive forms of MS seem to be mediated by intrinsic CNS immune processes behind an intact BBB, 67 182 183 67 184 183 185 186 187 In parallel, other studies have suggested two distinct neuropathological findings as early indicators of MS: “microglial nodules”, which involve damaged axons surrounded by small clusters of macrophages/microglia, 188 66 189 Nonetheless, rather than viewing the outside-in and inside-out models as opposing theories, an integrated perspective that accommodates both mechanisms may provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding MS etiology and pathogenesis. This approach acknowledges the actual interplay between immune-mediated and neurodegenerative pathogenic processes, as thoroughly discussed in the following section, and underscores the necessity of considering both pathways when developing therapeutic strategies. Immuno- and neuropathogenesis in MS Immune tolerance While activation of the immune system is essential for defending the body against pathogens, combating cancer, and managing inflammatory conditions, excessive or dysregulated immune activity can lead to detrimental outcomes such as autoimmune disorders, allergies, and hypersensitivity reactions. To prevent such adverse effects, the immune system must maintain a finely tuned balance between mounting effective defenses against external insults and avoiding harmful responses to self-antigens. This critical equilibrium is achieved through immune tolerance, a fundamental system that prevents the immune system from attacking self-antigens while allowing robust responses against pathogens. Immune tolerance occurs through both central and peripheral mechanisms that regulate immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity. 190 The capacity of the immune system to recognize a wide range of foreign peptides relies on the high diversity of immune cell receptors. While this diversity is crucial for preventing infections, it also inherently increases the risk of generating receptors that target self-peptides, potentially leading to autoimmune diseases. To mitigate this risk, the immune system employs central and peripheral selection mechanisms as critical checkpoints for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoreactivity. 191 + + 192 Within the bone marrow, developing B cells undergo selection on the basis of B-cell receptor (BCR) affinity for self-antigens. High-affinity binding triggers clonal deletion, whereas lower-affinity binding can induce anergy, a state of functional unresponsiveness. A significant portion of B cells edit their BCRs to avoid self-reactivity through ongoing immunoglobulin light (L) chain gene recombination, which alters antigen specificity. B cells that fail to edit or correct heavy (H) chain features may undergo apoptosis. Therefore, central tolerance regulates autoreactive B cells, reducing their frequency, affinity for self-tissue, or functionality within the B-cell repertoire. Despite the mechanisms of central tolerance, some self-reactive lymphocytes are found in the periphery in nondisease conditions, necessitating additional peripheral tolerance mechanisms to maintain immune homeostasis, 191 192 192 193 + 194 195 198 199 191 In addition, Treg cells play a central role in peripheral tolerance, with major subtypes including FoxP3 + 200 + 191 192 200 + − + 201 Finally, DCs are pivotal in establishing both central and peripheral immune tolerance. By processing and presenting antigens, DCs orchestrate T-cell differentiation and dictate T-cell commitment to a specific pathway, inducing anergy or deletion through the provision of diverse cytokines and stimulatory or inhibitory molecules. 202 200 203 Taken together, central and peripheral immune tolerance involve the participation of numerous cell types. The interplay between these mechanisms ensures effective immune responses against pathogens while maintaining tolerance to self-antigens and innocuous environmental antigens. However, under conditions such as MS, this equilibrium is disrupted. MS highlights the paradox of immune tolerance breakdown within the CNS despite its immune privilege. 204 207 Immune privilege of the CNS CNS immune privilege is generally understood as a mechanism to protect nonregenerative neural tissues from damage caused by complex immune responses. This concept originated from observations that tissue grafts in the brain are not rejected 208 209 204 207 210 The concept of CNS immune privilege has evolved significantly in recent years, revealing a more nuanced understanding of the interactions between the CNS and the immune system. This new perspective highlights the dynamic equilibrium between neuroprotection and immune engagement rather than absolute isolation. The CNS maintains antigenic surveillance through a sophisticated system involving CSF drainage and immune activity in the dura mater. 211 211 Advanced imaging studies, including fluorescent tracers in rodents and Gd-based MRI in humans, have confirmed that CNS antigens are captured by dural APCs, including DCs, macrophages and B cells. These APCs then prime circulating T cells, enabling peripheral immune recognition of CNS perturbations. 211 213 214 This new understanding of CNS immune interactions is further supported by recent research on the meningeal lymphatic system. The discovery of functional meningeal lymphatics revealed their role not only in fluid homeostasis but also in facilitating immune cell migration from the CNS to the periphery. 215 210 216 217 218 216 217 210 217 219 219 Recent research has revealed a novel mechanism of neuroimmune communication centered on a repertoire of CNS-derived regulatory self-peptides presented on MHC-II molecules. 220 + 220 The concept of CNS immune privilege is evolving from a model of passive isolation to one of active immunoregulation. Recent studies have shown that neuroimmune interactions occur at CNS borders, such as meningeal tissues and cervical lymph nodes, rather than through complete segregation. These interfaces employ specialized mechanisms to balance immune surveillance with neuronal protection, reflecting the unique needs of neural tissues. This shift emphasizes that CNS immune privilege arises from biological adaptations rather than from inaccessibility, redefining our understanding of neuroinflammatory diseases. 210 Tolerance breakdown mechanisms Despite the intricate mechanisms governing immune tolerance, the system remains imperfect, allowing for the emergence of autoimmune disorders. Consequently, extensive research has focused on uncovering the breakdown mechanisms driving neuroimmune dysregulation. Recent advances in neuroimmunology have revealed several key pathways that potentially contribute to the disruption of the delicate balance between the nervous and immune systems. These emerging hypotheses not only shed light on the complex interplay of factors involved in neuroinflammatory conditions but also offer promising avenues for therapeutic interventions. Among the emerging mechanistic hypotheses of immune tolerance breakdown, genetic and epigenetic factors play crucial roles, with variants in genes such as HLA-DRB1 altering microglial antigen presentation and immune tolerance pathways. 221 222 223 224 225 Immunopathogenesis Despite our incomplete understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of MS, classifying this disease as an autoimmune disorder is widely accepted. As already mentioned, the autoimmune origin of MS is based on evidence obtained from the EAE model, with which it shares clinical, pathological, and histological similarities. 74 226 230 + 227 228 + 231 232 + + 233 235 + + + 236 237 Regardless of the evident role of CD4 + + + + 177 238 240 + 241 + 242 243 244 245 A variety of Th autoreactive CD4 + + + 246 + 247 248 248 + + 249 247 250 2 Fig. 2 Immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

Although antibodies against myelin components, specifically MOG and myelin basic protein (MBP), are detectable in the CSF and serum of MS patients, their presence in the CSF is not exclusive to MS. Although anti-MOG antibodies were initially associated with conversion to MS, they were later linked to a distinct entity, MOGAD, rather than MS. 252 253 254 B-cell-depleting therapies with anti-CD20 antibodies are very efficient at suppressing disease activity in MS patients; however, antibody-secreting plasma cells do not express CD20, suggesting that B cells may contribute to MS immunopathogenesis through other functions beyond the production of pathogenic antibodies. For example, B cells serve as APCs and have been identified as key players in the activation of proinflammatory T cells (Th1 and Th17) in the context of EAE. 255 + 241 256 257 258 Myeloid cells, including microglia, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, play a central role in MS pathogenesis.

Furthermore, STAT3 signaling in myeloid cells is essential for promoting the differentiation of myelin-specific pathogenic Th1/Th17 cells in the early stages of EAE through antigen processing and presentation and the production of inflammatory cytokines, 268 Neuropathogenesis MS is characterized by the loss of myelin sheaths surrounding axons, which leads to a broad range of neurological impairments contributing to the wide array of symptoms observed in MS patients, including motor and sensory deficits, cognitive impairment, and fatigue. 269 3 Fig. 3 Neuropathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by demyelination, which begins with microglial activation, macrophage infiltration, and accumulation of CD8 + https://BioRender.com Demyelination is one of the hallmark features of MS, and it refers to the loss or damage of the myelin sheath. In MS, demyelination occurs in the CNS as a result of immune-mediated attacks on oligodendrocytes, leading to the formation of plaques and lesions that disrupt nerve conduction. 270 During the acute phase of MS, demyelination and plaque formation are accompanied by microglial activation and infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes. 271 272 + 273 274 This chronic inflammation is especially prominent in mixed active and inactive lesions, a term that combines previously described chronic active, smoldering, and SELs. Many of these lesions can be identified on high-field MR images because of the accumulation of iron-laden phagocytes at the lesion edge, bordering normal-appearing white matter. 275 Humoral immunity has been shown to contribute to demyelination in MS through antibody deposition and complement activation. IgG and IgM antibodies, likely produced by clonally expanded B cells in the CNS, target myelin components, although no single dominant autoantigen has been identified. 276 279 280 280 While early-disease acute lesions may experience some degree of remyelination, this process is often incomplete in long-standing plaques. From a cellular perspective, acute active lesions exhibit BBB breakdown, perivascular infiltration of primarily cytotoxic T cells, widespread presence of microglia and macrophages, and varying degrees of axonal damage. In contrast, chronic active lesions feature a gliotic, hypocellular core surrounded by a rim of activated myeloid cells. Last, chronic inactive lesions, on the other hand, have low cellularity throughout and are characterized by the accumulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. 281 Recent findings indicate that a major barrier to remyelination in MS is the failure of OPCs to mature into fully functional oligodendrocytes. As shown in animal models, effective remyelination requires the proliferation, migration, and maturation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes. For example, in inactive and mixed active-inactive MS lesions, OPCs are present but in reduced numbers and are unevenly distributed, whereas mature oligodendrocytes are almost entirely absent, 282 283 284 285 Several factors contribute to this impairment, including chronic inflammation, the presence of inhibitory molecules within lesions, and aging, and further research indicates that both OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes may contribute to lesion repair, but the mechanisms underlying remyelination failure are complex and influenced by disease duration, lesion stage, and location. 286 289 Over time, chronically demyelinated neurons are vulnerable to axonal injury and metabolic stress, contributing to neurodegeneration and disease progression. 290 291 292 294 295 296 Studies have shown that neuroaxonal injury occurs in both relapsing–remitting and progressive forms of MS, suggesting that neurodegeneration may be an intrinsic part of the disease process, not simply a consequence of accumulated demyelination. One of the most striking findings is that neurodegeneration in MS is not confined to the later stages of the disease but can begin early in the course of MS, even before overt clinical symptoms appear, but becomes more obvious in tissue samples from patients with progressive disease. 297 298 44 The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in MS are still being investigated, but several factors have been identified. Chronic inflammation is thought to play a role, as immune cells that infiltrate the CNS can directly damage neurons through the release of cytotoxic molecules such as nitric oxide, 299 300 301 302 303 As previously mentioned, microglia are the first cells to respond to injury or inflammation in the CNS. In MS, microglial activation is a hallmark feature of both acute and chronic lesions. While microglia are important for clearing cellular debris and modulating the immune response, their chronic activation in MS leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, ROS, and other neurotoxic factors that contribute to tissue damage and neurodegeneration. 281 304 Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that microglial activation is more pronounced in progressive forms of MS, where it is thought to play a key role in the ongoing neurodegeneration observed in these patients. 281 In addition, astrocytes, which are the most abundant glial cells in the CNS, become activated in response to inflammatory signals and injury in MS. Activated astrocytes contribute to neuroinflammation by releasing cytokines and chemokines that recruit additional immune cells. 305 306 273 305 307 The neuropathogenesis of MS involves a complex interplay between immune cell activation, demyelination, neurodegeneration, and glial cell responses. 302 Treatment strategies Acute treatment Although the primary goal in the management of MS is to prevent relapses, understanding the indications and therapeutic options for acute treatment is essential. Acute therapy accelerates clinical recovery but does not appear to reduce long-term disability or prevent future relapses. Consequently, treatment decisions must consider relapse severity, patient clinical history, comorbidities, and previous responses to acute treatments. General recommendations include treatment of moderate-to-severe relapses in the absence of contraindications, whereas mild relapses without significant functional impairment may not require treatment. 29 308 309 310 31 Approved disease-modifying therapies DMTs encompass numerous treatments aimed at reducing relapse frequency and preventing short-term disability accumulation, thus improving the quality of life of MS patients. Before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first DMT [IFN-β-1b] in 1993, MS treatment relied on broad-spectrum immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulin, and corticosteroids. However, these treatments have limited clinical efficacy and low safety profiles, prompting the development of more targeted therapies. Advances in our understanding of MS pathophysiology have led to the approval of numerous DMTs, enabling a more personalized therapeutic approach. DMTs vary widely in their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, safety profiles, and administration routes. Most of them modulate or suppress immune activity to reduce relapse frequency and MRI lesion accumulation, but no therapy has definitively halted or significantly slowed neurodegeneration. Consequently, most DMTs are approved for RRMS, while options are limited for PPMS patients, with ocrelizumab showing modest efficacy. 311 4 Fig. 4 Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) approved for multiple sclerosis. The figure represents the different DMTs according to their clinical efficacy (horizontal axis) and safety concerns (vertical axis). The colors indicate the route of administration: subcutaneous or intramuscular (yellow), oral (orange), or intravenous (red). The dashed borders denote DMTs approved for both relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and either secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS). FDA Food and Drug Administration. Created in https://BioRender.com Injectable DMTs Injectable DMTs are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly and include the interferon family and the amino acid copolymer glatiramer acetate. As mentioned earlier, IFN-β-1b was the first DMT approved for MS. Subsequently, IFN-β-1a and different IFN-β-1b formulations were introduced, offering both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration routes. 312 313 314 312 315 Oral DMTs Oral DMTs encompass drugs taken orally but with different mechanisms of action, clinical effectiveness and adverse effects: teriflunomide, fumarates, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators and cladribine. Teriflunomide Teriflunomide is the active metabolite of leflunomide, a classic immunosuppressant in rheumatologic diseases, and is administered once daily. Teriflunomide inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in pyrimidine synthesis, thus reducing the proliferation of activated T and B lymphocytes. Compared with placebo, clinical trials have shown comparable effectiveness to injectable DMTs, with a 30% reduction in the annualized relapse rate. Its main advantage is oral administration, but some serious adverse events, such as hepatotoxicity and teratogenesis, should be considered with caution. Common adverse effects include headache, increased liver enzymes, diarrhea, nausea and alopecia. It is contraindicated during pregnancy and requires a washout procedure with cholestyramine if needed 316 317 Fumarates This family includes two compounds: dimethyl fumarate and diroximate fumarate. These fumaric acid derivatives exert their immunomodulatory effects by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which regulates cellular responses to oxidative stress and inflammation. They have demonstrated efficacy in reducing relapse rates by 44% and 53%, respectively, in clinical trials. 318 318 319 320 S1P modulators These drugs function by modulating S1P receptors, which are involved in lymphocyte trafficking. By preventing lymphocyte egress from the lymph nodes, they reduce the infiltration of autoreactive immune cells into the CNS, thereby decreasing inflammation and disease activity in MS. 321 Fingolimod was the first S1P modulator approved for MS after it was demonstrated to significantly reduce the relapse rate by 54% and MRI activity. It is administered once daily and is well tolerated, although it requires first-dose cardiac monitoring owing to the risks of bradycardia and atrioventricular block. Other potential adverse effects include macular edema, liver enzyme elevation, and increased risk of infection (including exceptional cases of PML). 322 323 324 325 Cladribine Cladribine is a purine analog that selectively depletes B and T lymphocytes, leading to prolonged immunomodulation. 326 327 Intravenous DMTs Since the approval of natalizumab in 2004, followed by alemtuzumab in 2014 and ocrelizumab shortly thereafter, monoclonal antibodies have represented a groundbreaking advance in MS treatment. Compared with previous treatments, these therapies have demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in relapse rates, both compared with placebo and active comparators. However, they also present a more challenging safety profile, complicating individualized treatment decisions. Although not classified as a monoclonal antibody, mitoxantrone is an intravenously administered DMT and therefore will also be discussed in this section. Natalizumab Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits immune cell migration into the CNS by blocking the α4-integrin subunit, an adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of lymphocytes that is involved in transmigration across the endothelium into the CNS. 328 329 330 331 332 Anti-CD20 therapy Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen on B cells, leading to B-cell depletion and modulation of the immune response. It is infused once every 6 months. Ocrelizumab was the first therapy approved for PPMS based on the ORATORIO trial, which demonstrated a reduction in disability progression. 333 334 335 336 333 334 337 Alemtuzumab Alemtuzumab is a highly potent monoclonal antibody that targets CD52, a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of mature lymphocytes, with the consequent depletion of both T and B lymphocytes through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated lysis. It is approved for highly active relapsing MS and is typically reserved for patients with an inadequate response to other DMTs. It is administered in two courses 12 months apart. Compared with IFN-β-1a, clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in relapse rates and MRI lesion burden, with some evidence of sustained efficacy beyond initial treatment cycles. 338 339 Mitoxantrone Mitoxantrone is a cytotoxic anthracenedione that inhibits topoisomerase II, leading to DNA damage and the suppression of T and B lymphocytes. It was approved in 2000 for aggressive forms of MS with activity. However, its use is limited by serious adverse effects, including dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and an increased risk of secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Owing to these risks, its cumulative lifetime dose is restricted to 140 mg/m², and patients require regular cardiac monitoring before and during treatment. 340 341 The management of MS follows a personalized approach based on disease activity, severity, and individual patient factors. The main treatment strategies include the following: Early and high-efficacy treatment strategy: This approach advocates initiating treatment with high-efficacy DMTs (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, cladribine) early in the disease course to prevent relapses, limit disability accumulation, and improve long-term outcomes. This strategy is particularly favored for patients with aggressive MS phenotypes. 342 Escalation therapy: This traditional approach starts with lower-efficacy, first-line therapies (e.g., interferons, glatiramer acetate, or oral DMTs) and escalates to more potent treatments (e.g., monoclonal antibodies or immunosuppressants) if disease activity persists or worsens. Induction therapy: A strategy where patients are treated initially with a highly potent DMT (e.g., alemtuzumab) to induce long-term disease suppression, followed by lower-intensity maintenance therapy if needed. Some important factors, such as drug pharmacodynamics, biological effects, the risk of adverse effects, “rebound” activity or patient preferences (e.g., pregnancy planning), should be considered before starting or switching therapies. Regarding treatment duration, a recent randomized clinical trial concluded that discontinuing medium-efficacy therapy might be a reasonable option for patients older than 55 years with nonactive MS. 343 344 Treatment of symptoms While DMTs are designed to target the underlying inflammatory process of MS, symptomatic treatment also plays a crucial role in improving quality of life and managing long-term disability. Symptomatic therapy is tailored to the specific needs of each patient and often requires a multidisciplinary approach. The key areas of symptomatic treatment include the following: Fatigue: Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms of MS and can be a direct consequence of the disease or secondary to comorbid factors such as depression or sleep disorders. Treatment strategies include lifestyle modifications, energy conservation techniques, and physical therapy. Classical pharmacologic options such as amantadine, modafinil, and methylphenidate have not been demonstrated to be superior to placebo in a recent randomized clinical trial. 345 Spasticity and muscle stiffness: Muscle stiffness and spasticity can significantly impair mobility and produce pain. First-line treatments include baclofen, tizanidine, and gabapentinoids. In refractory cases, botulinum toxin injections or intrathecal baclofen pumps may be considered. 346 Neuropathic pain and sensory symptoms: Neuropathic pain, including burning or electric shock-like sensations, is commonly treated with gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine. Carbamazepine may be used for trigeminal neuralgia. 347 Bladder and bowel dysfunction: Overactive bladder symptoms are managed with anticholinergic medications (e.g., oxybutynin, solifenacin) or beta-3 agonists (mirabegron). Intermittent self-catheterization may be required for urinary retention. Constipation is treated with dietary modifications, fiber supplements, and laxatives. 348 Cognitive impairment and mood disorders: Cognitive dysfunction may benefit from cognitive rehabilitation programs. Depression and anxiety, which are common in MS patients, are managed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). 349 Gait and mobility impairment: Fampridine, a potassium channel blocker, can improve walking speed in some MS patients. Regular physical therapy and assistive devices also play essential roles in maintaining mobility. 350 Tremor and coordination problems: Tremor in MS can be challenging to treat, but options include propranolol, primidone, or, in severe cases, deep brain stimulation. 351 A multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, urologists, and mental health professionals is essential for optimal symptom management in MS patients. Current phase II and III clinical trials The emergence of numerous targeted therapies has revolutionized the prognosis of patients with MS in recent years. However, some issues remain challenging, especially the limited options for progressive forms of the disease. For this reason, ongoing research continues to explore novel DMTs for MS, particularly focusing on new mechanisms of action that can increase treatment efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. One of the most promising classes under investigation is Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis), which target B-cell and myeloid cell activation, offering potential benefits in both relapsing and progressive forms of MS. 352 Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors BTKi's work by modulating B-cell receptor signaling and myeloid cell activation, potentially reducing both acute inflammation and smoldering neurodegeneration. Several BTKi candidates are currently in phase II and III trials: Evobrutinib: Demonstrated a reduction in MRI activity in relapsing MS (RESCUE trial) but failed to confirm a reduction in the relapse rate of RRMS compared with teriflunomide in two multicentric trials (evolutionRMS1 and evolutionRMS2). Moreover, the incidence of serious adverse events (especially liver-related complications) was greater in patients receiving evobrutinib. 353 Tolebrutinib: In two phase III clinical trials (GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers NCT04410978 NCT04410991 354 NCT04411641 48 Fenebrutinib: In the phase II FENopta trial, fenebrutinib significantly reduced new gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions and new/enlarging T2 lesions over 12 weeks compared with placebo. In the subsequent open-label extension, patients maintained very low annualized relapse rates (≈0.04–0.06), with more than 95% remaining relapse-free at up to 96 weeks. No disability progression was observed, and MRI activity remained minimal. The safety profile was consistent with prior data, with no new safety signals reported. Phase III trials (FENhance 1 and 2 for relapsing MS; FENtrepid for PPMS) are ongoing 355 Other BTKi candidates, such as remibrutinib and orelabrutinib, are in phase II or III trials, but no results have been reported yet. Other emerging therapies  Remyelination therapies: Agents such as opicinumab (anti-LINGO-1) aim to promote myelin repair, although early trials have yielded mixed results. 356 Neuroprotective agents: The phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor Ibudilast has shown potential in slowing brain atrophy in progressive MS, as demonstrated in the SPRINT-MS trial. 357 Next-generation monoclonal antibodies: Current efforts are directed toward developing more selective and safer B-cell and T-cell targeted therapies, with the goal of enhancing efficacy while reducing immunosuppressive risks. These investigational therapies could significantly expand the MS treatment landscape, particularly for progressive forms, where current options remain limited. Continuous monitoring of trial outcomes will determine their future clinical application. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used for the treatment of MS and other autoimmune disorders since the late 1990s. 358 362 363 364 365 366 367 The first aHSCT for treating MS included patients with severe disability, RR and progressive forms of MS and/or rapidly evolving disease. The results of this first study pointed to a promising therapeutic application of aHSCT; although the follow-up periods were short (ranging from 3–36 months), the number of patients was limited (6–26 included patients), and patients presented severe disability. For example, Fassas et al. reported EDSS improvement in 6 out of 15 patients, although 3 experienced relapses or worsening disability. 358 361 368 360 362 Retrospective multicenter studies have collected evidence of the efficacy of aHSCT in treating patients with MS. 369 370 370 369 371 Clinical trials conducted in the middle 2000s refined the selection of patients and homogenized the end point assessments, as reported in real-world experience and retrospective studies. 372 373 374 375 376 372 377 378 In terms of immune reconstitution, 12 months after HSCT, the naive TCR repertoire is completely renewed, and the reactivity of T cells against MS-related antigens decreases. 379 380 381 376 382 379 381 In summary, aHSCT has been shown to be highly effective in RRMS patients who do not respond to conventional DMTs, as it suppresses disease activity by eliminating inflammation. In contrast, SPMS patients exhibit a less favorable response to treatment, but its efficacy remains poor in patients with PPMS. The SPMS and PPMS forms of MS are driven primarily by chronic neurodegenerative mechanisms, with limited contributions from acute inflammatory relapses. As such, therapeutic strategies targeting immune-mediated inflammation, including aHSCT, have demonstrated reduced efficacy in these disease forms. While aHSCT has shown high efficacy in suppressing inflammatory activity in RRMS patients, its impact on the slow, progressive neurodegeneration characteristic of SPMS and PPMS remains limited. This distinction in disease biology likely underlies the less effective therapeutic response observed in progressive MS. The European Committee for Treatment and Research on Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and the EBMT Autoimmune Diseases Working Party (ADWP) reviewed the current state of aHSCT in adults with MS in 2022 and provided consensus recommendations for the use of aHSCT in patients with MS (see 364 364 Antigen-specific immunotherapies for MS The complexity of MS pathogenesis makes it challenging to develop therapies that restore immune self-tolerance without compromising immune function. Owing to the autoimmune origin of MS, many antigen-specific tolerance approaches are currently aimed at attenuating autoimmunity at the level of peripheral tolerance, and a large proportion of these approaches have already been tested in clinical trials. 383 385 3 Table 3 Comparative overview of antigen-specific immunotherapies in multiple sclerosis Antigen-specific immunotherapies Advantages Disadvantages Peptide and protein-based approaches High specificity and selectivity in targeting autoreactive immune cells Low toxicity and minimal systemic immunosuppression Versatile mechanisms, including oral tolerance and high-zone tolerance induction Limited clinical success due to variability in patient response Poor stability and short half-life of peptides High production costs and challenges in delivery DNA vaccination approach Induces long-lasting antigen-specific immune tolerance Safe and well-tolerated in early trials Broad tolerance induction, extending to multiple myelin antigens Flexible delivery methods (intramuscular, intradermal, gene gun) Variable efficacy in clinical trials; inconsistent results Potential risk of unintended immune responses Low transfection efficiency compared to viral-based gene delivery Regulatory and standardization challenges Peptide-loaded into a carrier approaches Enhanced antigen delivery and immune modulation Availability of large-scale manufacturing, low production costs and easy manufacturing processes. Small, soluble and bioavailable carrier platforms Targeted biodistribution Potential risk of immune activation instead of tolerance Limited large-scale clinical evidence Regulatory challenges due to the novelty of nanotechnology in medicine Cellular immunotherapy approaches Minimal risk of immune rejection or pro-inflammatory immune response Reduced need for targeted delivery Demonstrated feasibility and safety in preclinical trials High cost and complex manufacturing of personalized cell therapies Variability in patient response and durability of effects. Limited large-scale clinical validation Ethical and regulatory challenges, particularly with genetically modified cells TolDCs Peptide- and protein-based approaches A wide range of peptide- and protein-based approaches have been investigated to induce immune tolerance in MS. This perspective includes whole myelin antigens, unaltered myelin peptide ligands, altered myelin peptide ligands, and soluble myelin peptide–MHC complexes (Fig. 5a Tolerization based on the whole myelin antigen A traditional approach to inducing immune tolerance involves the oral administration of antigens. 386 387 388 Therefore, it is not surprising that the initial endeavour to translate immune tolerance in MS clinical practice revolved around the oral administration of whole bovine myelin, comprising both MBP and proteolipid protein (PLP). The outcomes of a placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial involving 30 RRMS patients who were administered 300 mg of bovine myelin capsules daily for one year revealed that in the myelin-treated group, six out of fifteen individuals experienced at least one major exacerbation of neurological symptoms, compared with twelve out of fifteen in the control group. Moreover, the number of T cells that exhibited reactivity toward MBP was notably lower in the myelin-treated group than in the control group. Importantly, no instances of toxicity or side effects were observed. Nonetheless, the interpretation of these results was hampered by the limited sample size. 389 386 390 Tolerization based on unaltered myelin peptide ligands An alternative strategy for inducing immune tolerance in MS involves the administration of high doses of soluble antigen, known as “high zone tolerance”. 391 392 394 391 395 In clinical studies, the approach focused on utilizing highly immunodominant myelin peptides, specifically those targeting the MBP 82–98 396 85–96 396 82–98 397 82–98 398 82–98 398 In line with this research, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a transdermally applied mixture of three myelin peptides (MBP 85–99 35–55 139–155 399 89–101 400 400 84–102 401 401 402 402 35–55 35–55 serve as templates for creating nonpeptide drugs suitable for oral administration. These combined benefits make them attractive candidates for future drug development. 403 35–55 35–55 403 35–55 403 Currently, the investigational compound Neurovax is under examination. It consists of three TCR peptides (BV5S2, BV6S5, and BV13S1) that are overexpressed in myelin-reactive T cells and are associated with MS pathology. 404 405 406 408 405 405 405 409 410 NCT02200718 NCT02149706 NCT02057159 In summary, clinical trials involving peptide-based therapies have yielded diverse outcomes, which may be attributed to variations in the mode of administration, patient cohorts, and the use of single- versus multipeptide treatments. Tolerization based on altered myelin peptide ligands Altered peptide ligands (APLs) are modified versions of natural peptides that influence T-cell function by either blocking activation (antagonists) or inducing weak stimulation (partial agonists). Their ability to modulate immune responses opens new therapeutic venues, where copresentation with the original peptide could suppress harmful immune activity by altering T-cell signaling. and reducing their effector functions. 411 In this sense, some preclinical studies explored APLs for modulating T-cell responses in MS. The first preclinical approach involved [A 4 1–11 412 72–85 73 76 79 413 72–85 72–85, 414 91 87–99 87–99 415 91 96 87–99 96 87–99 416 417 144 147 139–151 418 83–99 83–99 419 83–99 420 87–99 421 422 The first APL tested in clinical trials was derived from the MBP 83–99 CGP77116 CGP77116 83–99 423 83–99 424 424 424 Tolerization based on soluble myelin peptide-MHC complexes An alternative approach to induce immunotolerance in MS involves the utilization of myelin peptides loaded on MHC complexes (pMHCs). These complexes interact specifically with TCR ligands in the absence of costimulatory signals, 425 426 139–151 91–103 427 s 139–151 91–103 427 84–102 428 429 430 433 35–55 434 434 Taken together, peptide- and protein-based therapies hold great promise in precision medicine because of their high specificity, selectivity, and ability to target diverse biological pathways with minimal toxicity. The rapid development and engineering flexibility of these materials further increase their therapeutic appeal. However, their clinical translation faces significant challenges, including poor stability, short half-life, and inefficient delivery, as they often exhibit low oral bioavailability and struggle to cross biological barriers. Additionally, high production costs, potential immunogenicity, and stringent storage requirements further complicate their widespread adoption. Future progress hinges on the integration of innovative formulation technologies, advanced delivery systems, and rational design approaches to optimize their therapeutic potential and establish them as viable mainstream treatments. DNA vaccination approach DNA vaccination is a promising approach for the treatment of MS and was proposed as early as 1996 by Waisman and colleagues. 435 435 5b 436 436 437 443 A DNA vaccine containing the MBP gene prevented EAE in eight out of nine Lewis rats. Protection correlated with MBP-specific IgG1 antibodies, indicating a Th2-driven immune response and supporting the role of Th2 immunity in EAE suppression and recovery. 437 139–151 438 91–108 440 68–86 442 This approach led to phase I/II and phase II clinical trials. The first was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of BHT-3009, a tolerizing DNA vaccine encoding full-length human MBP. The study design included a total of 30 RRMS and SPMS patients enrolled in placebo, BHT-3009 alone, and BHT-3009 plus atorvastatin calcium and involved intramuscular administration of the DNA vaccine at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9 after randomization. The authors demonstrated that BHT-3009 was safe and well tolerated. In addition, the results revealed an induction of tolerance to the antigen-specific autoreactive immune response with a favorable reduction in inflammatory lesions, downregulation of IFN-γ-producing CD4 + 444 445 Overall, this approach employs versatile delivery methods (intramuscular, intradermal, or gene gun) to induce immune tolerance via T-cell anergy and Th2 bias. Clinical trials have confirmed the safety, tolerability, and reduced incidence of inflammatory lesions, with plasmid-based immunomodulation enhancing Treg cell responses. However, translation remains limited, with no trials beyond phase II and uncertain long-term efficacy. Route dependency, CpG-driven innate activation, and preclinical inconsistencies highlight challenges in optimizing multiplasmid formulations. Species-specific differences and HLA-independent mechanisms further limit broad applicability. DNA vaccination offers a precise and adaptable strategy for MS, but gaps in clinical validation, route optimization, and mechanistic clarity persist. Future efforts should refine plasmid design, incorporate biomarker-driven dosing, and explore adjunct therapies to increase regulatory responses. While promising, success hinges on overcoming translational hurdles and demonstrating sustained efficacy in larger, diverse cohorts. Peptide-loaded carrier approaches Recognizing the limitations encountered in clinical trials involving peptide antigens for tolerance induction, including variability in immune responses, inefficient APC transfection, and challenges translating animal model success to humans, alternative therapeutic strategies have explored the use of cells, extracellular vesicles (EVs) and nanoparticles as antigen delivery vehicles. These innovations draw inspiration from the natural capacity of DCs, apoptotic cells, and cell bodies to safeguard against inflammation and sustain self-tolerance within physiological contexts. 446 Biological carrier approaches This approach uses autologous PBMCs, erythrocytes, and EVs loaded with MS autoantigen peptides as carriers to induce tolerance. 446 447 448 446 5c 449 139–151 178–191 84–104 139–151 84–104 450 139–151 178–191 84–104 92–106 451 The first clinical trial demonstrated the feasibility, favorable safety and good tolerability of a single infusion of autologous PBMCs loaded with seven myelin peptides (MOG 1–20 35–55 13–32 83–99 111–129 146–170 139–154 9 452 453 454 - 2+ 455 35–55 456 35–55 35–55 457 A multicenter, phase Ib/IIa clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous peptide-coupled red blood cells, designated CLS12311 CLS12311 While cell carrier approaches hold promise for antigen-specific immunotherapies, they encounter several limitations, including variability in the lifespan and migratory capacity of carrier cells, challenges in achieving targeted antigen delivery, potential immunogenicity triggering unwanted immune responses, scalability and cost-effectiveness issues, and regulatory complexities. 458 A recent study highlighted the critical role of MHC-II-mediated presentation of endogenous “guardian” peptides in maintaining immune tolerance within the CNS under homeostatic conditions 220 160–175 220 459 160–175 160–175 192–216 323–339 + − + 220 + − + Ctla4 Tgfb1 Ptpn6 Ptpn11 160–175 220 220 Despite the promising therapeutic potential of EV-based therapies, their clinical translation is hindered by significant limitations, including inherent heterogeneity, inconsistent isolation and characterization, and potential immunogenicity. 460 460 Synthetic carrier approaches Nanotechnology has emerged as an alternative solution to overcome the difficulties associated with biological carriers. Indeed, drug delivery nanosystems are considered novel technology platforms that can transport antigenic molecules to target tissues while increasing therapeutic effectiveness and reducing potential negative effects 461 5d 462 463 464 465 466 In addition to polymer or lipid nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles are inorganic nanomaterials known for their exceptional stability and rigidity, maintaining their integrity even at low concentrations. Unlike organic nanomaterials, gold nanoparticles provide a robust platform for drug delivery and are capable of chemically or physically loading drug molecules onto their surfaces. The uptake of gold nanoparticles by cells depends on factors such as size, shape, surface charge, and ligand functionality. Typically, ranging from 10 to 100 nm in size, gold nanoparticles exhibit size- and shape-dependent half-lives in the bloodstream. Furthermore, polymer coatings can be added to gold nanoparticles to increase their drug-loading efficiency, circulation time, biodistribution, and overall functionality. When conjugated with drugs via electrostatic interactions or various linkers, such as thiols, amides, or hydrazine, gold nanoparticles serve as highly effective drug carriers. To bypass the reticuloendothelial system, the main barrier in systemic delivery, polyethylene glycol is frequently used to absorb water molecules, thus enabling gold nanoparticles to evade macrophage detection, thereby preventing their removal and reducing nonspecific binding during delivery while improving the efficiency of drug delivery to target cells. 467 Peptide-loaded nanoparticles Some scientists have proposed that PEGylated gold nanoparticles, which carry both a disease-relevant autoantigen and a ligand-activated transcription factor known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), might stimulate the generation of antigen FoxP3 + + + 468 470 470 + 471 473 35–55 35–55 474 139–151 139–151 178–191 139–151 178–191 474 According to some studies, encapsulating immunodominant peptides in their native form within mannosylated liposomes offers a significant advantage. This encapsulation, coupled with the presence of mannose residues on the liposome surface, enables targeted delivery to APCs. These cells are equipped with a greater density of mannose receptors, such as the CD206 receptor in DCs, facilitating the efficient endocytosis of mannosylated liposome particles. 475 476 477 46–62 124–139 147–170 478 46–62 124–139 147–170 479 Other researchers aimed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance and developed polylactide-coglycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles that encapsulate peptide antigens alongside the tolerogenic immunomodulator rapamycin. This approach triggers the generation of regulatory DCs while inhibiting the mTOR pathway. The results of EAE models revealed protection from relapse due to the inhibition of antigen-specific CD4 + + 480 35–55 35–55 481 35–55 35–55 35–55 35–55 482 35–55 483 484 35–55 35–55 485 35–55 35–55 + 486 As previously mentioned, several research initiatives have drawn inspiration from the physiological process of tissue turnover, in which useless cells undergo apoptosis and are rapidly cleared. To take advantage of this naturally occurring tolerance, liposomes mimicking apoptotic bodies have been proposed as carriers of self-antigens to induce antigen-specific tolerance in the context of autoimmunity. Liposomes are versatile lipid-based vesicles that can be engineered to display PS molecules on their surface. As mentioned earlier, PS phospholipids are exposed on the outer leaflet of the membrane when the cell enters apoptosis. 487 488 35–55 488 489 Expanding on this concept of peptide-loaded nanoparticles, another promising strategy involves the use of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex-loaded nanoparticles to directly modulate autoreactive T-cell responses. This approach is based on the hypothesis that the engagement of the TCR with its pMHC target without costimulation results in the induction of apoptosis or anergy. Furthermore, this approach proposes that pMHC-loaded nanoparticles hold promise as a more effective strategy to control T-cell activity in autoimmune diseases than traditional approaches using soluble pMHC molecules. The potential benefits lie in the ability of nanoparticles to interact with multiple T cells simultaneously, potentially triggering a specific suppressive response, and offering protection from degradation, leading to a more sustained effect. 426 38–49 35–55 38–49 490 null 175–192 97–108 175–192 97–108 490 null 175–192 175–192 97–108 259–273 259–273 97–108 490 Peptide conjugated to antibodies Another subject of interest regarding the induction of immune tolerance in MS involves the conjugation of antigens with antibodies specific for APC receptors, such as the receptor DEC205, which is specifically expressed on DCs and thymic epithelial cells and is involved in antigen presentation. This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that administering antigens coupled with antibodies targeting DEC205 stimulates antigen presentation by immature DCs, subsequently initiating the differentiation of naive T cells to Treg cells in the periphery. 491 139–151 139–151 139–151 492 35–55 35–55 + 493 Antibodies against DC inhibitory receptor 2 (DCIR2), which specifically target CD11c + − 139–151 139–151 494 + 494 In a recent preclinical study, researchers aimed to prevent and suppress established EAE in mice by inducing T-apoptosis via a combination of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies alongside the administration of MOG 35–55 139–151 35–55 139–151 495 + + 495 Considering the above findings, peptide-loaded carrier approaches enhance antigen delivery, promote long-lasting immune tolerance, and minimize systemic side effects, making them a promising strategy for MS treatment. Their versatility in carrier selection allows for targeted modulation of multiple autoimmune pathways, offering advantages over traditional immunotherapies. 496 Cellular immunotherapy approaches Antigen-specific cell-based tolerogenic therapies represent intriguing approaches for restoring self-tolerance by specifically targeting and diminishing autoreactive T-cell clones. 497 498 5e Fig. 5 Schematic diagram depicting ongoing antigen-specific immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis. a b c d e + + https://BioRender.com T-cell vaccination The conventional method of T-cell vaccination (TCV) has spurred an alternative strategy aimed at inducing T-cell-dependent inhibition of autoimmune responses via immunization with attenuated autoreactive T cells. 499 499 + + 500 500 In an initial preclinical study, some authors revealed that intravenous inoculation of syngeneic rats with an attenuated MBP-reactive T-cell line conferred protection to naive rats against the subsequent induction of EAE. 501 502 With respect to the unclear TCV mechanism, another study examined the role of the CD28:CD80/86 interaction in TCV-induced protection in a murine model of EAE.

The trial was conducted in 150 subjects to evaluate safety and efficacy in RRMS and CIS patients. In this sense, tovaxin has a positive safety profile. 510 510 To conclude, the promising results derived from a variety of clinical trials undertaken across various phases of MS provide a rationale for considering TCV as a feasible alternative to MS treatment. Despite the limitations faced by particular trials, both the approach of vaccinating with T-cell clones and the utilization of multiple antimyelin cell lines (polyclonal vaccines) demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and clinical efficacy inherent in TCV for MS. Nonetheless, further investigations encompassing more extensive patient cohorts and prolonged periods of follow-up are needed to increase the robustness and validity of these observations. Tolerogenic dendritic cell-based treatment DCs play a vital role in both activating adaptive immune responses to eliminate invading pathogens and establishing tolerance to self-components for the maintenance of immunological and tissue homeostasis. 511 512 202 202 202 425 513 514 40–55 515 516 In the context of clinical trials, a phase 1b study included eight patients with MS and four patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), a chronic brain and spinal cord disorder primarily associated with aquaporin-4 (AQP4) autoantigens that target up to 80% of cases (all patients in this study had anti-AQP4 antibodies as an enrollment criterion). This study investigated escalating concentrations of autologous tolDCs pulsed with peptides derived from diverse myelin proteins (such as MOG 1–20 35–55 13–32 83–99 111–129 146–170 139–154 517 517 518 6 NCT02618902 NCT02903537 519 519 In summary, advancements within the scientific domains of recombinant protein expression, genome editing, and nanotechnology-driven drug delivery mechanisms, coupled with refined immunization protocols, have the potential to increase the prospective utility of tolDC vaccination in future periods. 202 Antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptor-modified Treg cell therapy An appealing therapeutic approach for MS involves the use of engineered Treg cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for myelin. This strategy addresses key limitations of polyclonal Treg cell therapy, such as the need for large cell numbers and the risk of nonspecific immunosuppression, including viral reactivation. CAR-Treg cells offer a more targeted approach by recognizing specific myelin antigens, allowing for localized suppression of autoimmune responses with fewer administered cells. CARs are composed of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv), an extracellular hinge, a transmembrane region, and intracellular signaling domains. This approach has been successfully extended to Treg cell therapies, resulting in the development of CAR-Treg cells. 520 521 + 522 Further studies demonstrated that both MBP- and MOG-specific CAR-Treg cells significantly reduced disease progression in EAE models, whereas polyclonal Treg cells had limited efficacy. This finding reinforces the superior therapeutic potential of antigen-specific CAR-Tregs over their polyclonal counterparts, particularly in terms of antigen-targeted action, clinical efficacy, and reduction in systemic immunosuppression. 523 524 It is important to distinguish this CAR-Treg cell approach from other antigen-specific Treg expansion strategies, such as those utilizing APCs. As previously discussed in the context of tolDCs, APCs can be used to induce and expand antigen-specific Treg cells by presenting relevant myelin antigens in an immunomodulatory manner. 525 525 526 523 527 528 527 528 529 530 528 These findings suggest that antigen-specific CAR-Treg cell therapies could provide MS patients with a novel means of preventing relapses and limiting disability progression. Further research is warranted to refine CAR designs, optimize delivery strategies, and evaluate long-term safety in clinical settings. In summary, cellular immunotherapy approaches in MS provide targeted immune modulation through strategies such as TCV, tolDCs, and CAR-Treg cells, aiming to suppress autoreactive T cells while preserving systemic immunity. These therapies demonstrate strong preclinical efficacy in EAE models, showing reduced CNS inflammation, Treg cell induction, and multiepitope targeting to mitigate epitope spreading. Unlike broad immunosuppression, cellular therapies offer a more precise approach, potentially improving treatment outcomes with fewer side effects. 531 532 Challenges and future directions of antigen-specific immunotherapies Antigen-specific immunotherapies for MS are promising for eliminating the detrimental autoimmune response, stopping disease progression and sidestepping the side effects associated with currently available therapies. In the context of MS, the exact primary target antigen remains uncertain, but there is a consensus that proteins found in the myelin sheath, such as MBP, MOG, and PLP, are essential in the autoimmune response. 533 534 535 452 4 423 428 505 Table 4 Challenges and strategic solutions for advancing antigen-specific immunotherapies in multiple sclerosis Challenges Proposed solution Uncertainty in target antigens Develop multiepitope strategies to account for antigenic variability and immune response fluctuations Epitope spreading Use combination therapies targeting multiple myelin antigens to prevent immune escape Preclinical models’ limitations Improve humanized mouse models and integrate human antigen analogs to enhance clinical translatability Lack of sustained immune tolerance Focus on long-term immune monitoring and explore adjuvant therapies that enhance tolerance maintenance Unintended immune activation Modify vaccine adjuvants and optimize nanoparticle formulations to reduce pro-inflammatory risks High production and scalability issues Optimize production pipelines, automate cell culture systems, and explore cost-effective synthetic formulations Optimal route of administration Prioritize intravenous delivery to better target immune-regulatory organs like the spleen and liver Lack of reliable biomarkers for patient stratification Identify and validate predictive biomarkers to optimize patient selection and improve clinical trial success rates Regulatory and approval barriers Develop adaptive clinical trial designs and engage early with regulatory agencies to streamline approval pathways Variability in clinical trial outcomes Implement stratified trial designs based on HLA typing and immune profiling to enhance treatment personalization HLA In this context, the creation of “humanized” mouse models for autoimmune diseases presents a promising avenue to address these challenges, as it allows for preclinical assessment of compounds specifically designed for human targets. Moreover, the substitution of murine autoantigens with their human analogs, aimed at overcoming species-specific variations in primary structure, may facilitate the clinical translation of antigen-specific therapies 536 537 538 539 465 Technical and manufacturing constraints further complicate clinical translation. Peptide instability and rapid degradation reduce therapeutic efficacy, whereas DNA-based therapies often exhibit low transfection efficiency and variable antigen expression. Cellular therapies, including tolDCs and CAR-Treg cells, introduce additional complexity owing to their reliance on autologous cell collection, ex vivo expansion, and reinfusion. The need for highly personalized manufacturing not only increases costs but also limits scalability, making widespread application impractical under current conditions. The high production costs associated with nanoparticle-based vaccines, DNA plasmids, and cell-based therapies also pose considerable financial challenges. Unlike small-molecule drugs, which benefit from established large-scale manufacturing pipelines, antigen-specific immunotherapies require specialized production facilities, significantly increasing costs and limiting their commercial viability. 540 543 Additionally, the route of administration plays a crucial role in determining therapeutic success. The route of antigen administration represents another important challenge for tolerization approaches. This encompasses different modalities, including oral, nasal (typically mucosal), transdermal, intravenous, intramuscular or intranodal delivery of cells or other carriers, i.e., nanoparticles coupled to autoantigens. Oral administration has long been regarded as the preferred method for inducing tolerance, primarily because of the significant role played by the mucosal immune system in ensuring tolerance to food antigens. 384 424 384 544 Further challenges confront antigen-specific approaches. These challenges include decisions related to dosage, administration frequency, selection of antigens, and even the composition of combinatory therapies. The latter should ideally include a potent anti-inflammatory treatment to reduce disease activity and create an optimal environment for tolerance induction via an antigen-specific approach. This is particularly crucial, as antigen-specific therapy should ideally be initiated during the early stages of the disease, when inflammatory activity is prominent. Specifically, in the case of MS patients with high disease activity, it has been proposed to explore the duration of combinatory therapy before transitioning to a monotherapy approach using a tolerizing agent. 384 Beyond these technical hurdles, regulatory and economic barriers further restrict clinical progress. One of the most pressing concerns is the absence of reliable biomarkers for patient stratification. Unlike conventional immunosuppressants, which act broadly, antigen-specific immunotherapies require precise patient selection to maximize efficacy. Without validated biomarkers, clinical trials encompass heterogeneous patient populations, potentially diluting therapeutic effects and leading to inconclusive results. Consequently, it becomes imperative to develop biomarkers for the following purposes: guiding the determination of appropriate dosages, assessing the induction of immune tolerance, gauging the duration of the tolerization effect alongside clinical outcome parameters, and distinguishing between responder and nonresponder subjects. Furthermore, it is recommended that clinical trial designs incorporate mechanistic investigations and define the optimal target population most likely to respond positively to the treatment. 545 Moreover, regulatory agencies impose rigorous safety requirements, particularly for novel approaches such as nanoparticle-based formulations and CAR-Treg cells. These stringent standards, coupled with the need for long-term safety assessments, prolong approval timelines and deter investment in antigen-specific immunotherapy development. Lessons from clinical trials further underscore the complexity of antigen-specific immunotherapy translation. Peptide-based therapies, despite demonstrating high specificity, exhibit considerable variability in patient response, largely owing to differences in HLA type and immune reactivity. For example, MBP 82–98 398 546 Ultimately, antigen-specific immunotherapies offer a transformative approach to MS treatment by providing antigen-specific immune modulation with reduced systemic immunosuppression. However, their clinical viability hinges on overcoming the numerous translational barriers outlined above. Future research must focus on refining delivery systems, optimizing patient stratification, and integrating biomarker-driven treatment approaches. Additionally, combination strategies that leverage the strengths of antigen-specific immunotherapies alongside existing immunomodulatory therapies may offer the best path forward. Addressing these challenges in a systematic manner will be essential to unlocking the full therapeutic potential of antigen-specific immunotherapies in MS. Conclusions The ever-evolving epidemiology of MS, coupled with its diverse clinical phenotypes and complex pathophysiology, underscores the challenges in disease management. Our increasing understanding of MS etiology and pathogenesis has paved the way for more tailored therapeutic approaches, improving treatment precision. Despite significant advancements in DMTs, their efficacy is often accompanied by immune suppression-related risks and adverse effects, necessitating safer and more targeted alternatives. Antigen-specific immunotherapies represent a paradigm shift in the treatment landscape of MS, offering unprecedented precision in modulating pathogenic immune responses while minimizing off-target effects associated with current immunotherapies. Beyond MS, these approaches hold considerable promise for addressing a broader spectrum of organ-specific autoimmune diseases, potentially redefining how we approach immune tolerance across diverse clinical contexts. The ultimate objective of these therapies lies in restoring immune homeostasis, paving the way for long-term disease remission and improved quality of life for patients. As advancements in biotechnology and immunology converge, the transition from experimental frameworks to clinically viable antigen-specific therapies is no longer a distant prospect but an imminent reality. The integration of these transformative strategies into MS management represents a crucial step toward fulfilling the unmet needs of this complex disease.
