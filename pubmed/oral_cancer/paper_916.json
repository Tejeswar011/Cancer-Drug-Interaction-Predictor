IRI is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis/ferroptosis. There is therefore a rationale for supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to mediate the adverse effects of IRI, given the role of CoQ10 in promoting normal mitochondrial function, as an antioxidant, and as an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic/ferroptotic agent. In this article we have reviewed the potential role of supplementary CoQ10 in organ transplantation in preclinical animal studies based on the above actions; the role of supplementary CoQ10 in promoting stem cell action in transplantation and its role in alleviating the adverse effects of immunosuppressants used in organ transplantation are also discussed. organ transplantation coenzyme Q10 mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation apoptosis ferroptosis stem cells immunosuppressants This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The viability of organs for transplant is limited by the time in cold storage, which results in the development of so-called ischaemia–reperfusion injury (IRI). IRI results from the initial interruption of organ blood flow and subsequent restoration of organ blood flow and is a major factor in determining the outcome of organ transplantation. IRI is closely associated with early graft failure, enhancing allograft immunogenicity and promoting acute and chronic rejection. IRI results in mitochondrial dysfunction, with associated oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis/ferroptosis. Mitochondria have a key role in cell metabolism, including the production of ATP, the generation of oxidising free radical species (ROS), the mediation of the immune response, and the regulation of cell death. During ischemia, hypoxia leads to cessation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (which plays a crucial role in energy production), increased generation of ROS, and initiation of apoptosis/ferroptosis. Reperfusion exacerbates mitochondrial damage, triggering the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory responses. IRI, therefore, comprises a cascade of cellular events, including energy loss, generation of reactive oxygen free radical species, release of cytokines, activation of immune cells, and cell death [ 1 2 2. IRI and Mitochondrial Dysfunction As noted in the previous section of this article, IRI results from a self-reinforcing cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death. During ischaemia, the transfer of electrons along the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is disrupted by hypoxia, since during cellular respiration oxygen (because of its high electronegativity) is the terminal electron acceptor in the ETC. This in turn interferes with the transfer of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, reducing the proton motive force (i.e., the energy stored as an electrochemical gradient) required for oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. When the blood flow is re-established during reperfusion, re-oxygenation aggravates the damage caused during the ischaemia. The accumulation of fumarate during ischaemic preservation triggers the reverse activity of mitochondrial complex II and the reduction of fumarate to succinate, with succinate accumulating and acting as an electron sink [ 3 3 Figure 1 A number of studies have provided evidence confirming the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in IRI. Thus, Pollara et al. [ 4 5 6 7 Martins et al. [ 8 9 10 11 12 In addition to the above studies using human tissues, evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in IRI has also been obtained from studies in animal models. For example, Sammut et al. [ 13 14 15 As noted in the introduction, CoQ10 has a key role in the normal functioning of mitochondria. CoQ10 has a key role as an electron carrier (from complex I and II to complex III) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation. CoQ10 is also a key component in the reactions mediated by other mitochondrial enzymes; for example, it is also involved in the metabolism of pyrimidines, fatty acids, and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, as well as in the regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. CoQ10 serves as an important lipid-soluble antioxidant, protecting mitochondrial membranes from free radical-induced oxidative stress [ 16 3. IRI and Oxidative Stress Oxidative stress is defined by the imbalance between the production of highly reactive and potentially damaging free radical species (particularly ROS) and the capacity of antioxidants to protect cells against such damage. Within cells free radicals may originate from several sources, but as noted in previous sections of this article, during IRI the principal source of free radicals is from damaged mitochondria. Hypoxia reduces the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; uncoupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, together with weakening of the antioxidant system, results in excessive ROS production and oxidative damage to cell components. In addition, enzymes responsible for free radical generation, such as NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase, may be activated during IRI, serving as an additional ROS source. The administration of antioxidants in organ donors, organ preservation solutions, and organ recipients has been proposed; however, the results from clinical trials have been equivocal [ 17 CoQ10 (particularly in its reduced ubiquinol form) serves as an important lipid-soluble antioxidant protecting cellular membranes, both mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial (Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes), from free radical-induced oxidative stress (OS). In addition to acting as an antioxidant directly, CoQ10 is also involved in the regeneration of the antioxidants vitamin C and vitamin E, respectively [ 16 4. IRI and Inflammation There is a common misconception that inflammation, which involves the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is a wholly negative process within the body. However, inflammation is the body’s normal response to infection or injury and is essential for tissue healing, although this process should resolve following the initial immune response. When control of this process is lost, then further tissue damage results; mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as factors contributing to the loss of control of the latter process. The dysfunction of mitochondria and the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), ROS, and calcium initiate an immune response involving both innate and adaptive immune systems. The release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from damaged mitochondria is a particularly potent activator of inflammation [ 18 CoQ10 performs several cellular functions of potential relevance to the immune system. Firstly, the immune response has intensive energy requirements, and an adequate supply of CoQ10 is therefore required to enable the various cell types of the immune system to function optimally. Secondly, since phagocytic cells destroy invading pathogens via the production of free radicals, the antioxidant action of CoQ10 may protect phagocytic cells from self-destruction caused by their generation of free radicals. Thirdly, CoQ10 can directly modulate the action of genes involved in inflammation and may have a role in controlling the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 19 5. IRI and Apoptosis/Ferroptosis Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process of programmed cell death that can occur as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction following IRI during organ transplantation; pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c are released from damaged mitochondria into the cytoplasm to induce apoptosis mediated by caspase-type proteolytic enzymes [ 2 20 21 Another consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction during IRI that can contribute to organ transplant failure is ferroptosis [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 6. IRI and Mesenchymal Stem Cells Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), typically derived from bone marrow, have the potential to protect organs from IRI during transplantation via several mechanisms, including antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory action, anti-apoptotic action, and mitochondrial transfer. A number of studies have demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of MSCs with regard to transplantation of human organs. For example, in lungs from deceased donors undergoing cold storage, intratracheal administration of MSCs significantly decreased the levels of a number of inflammatory markers [ 29 30 Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of CoQ10 administration in MSCs. Mauro et al. [ 31 32 33 MSC function declines in older individuals, and that MSC dysfunction influences the effects of autologous MSC transplantation in older individuals [ 34 35 36 37 7. IRI and Mitochondrial Transplantation A relatively recent strategy to address mitochondrial dysfunction in IRI is mitochondrial transplantation therapy (MTT). MTT uses replacement of defective mitochondria with viable, respiration-competent mitochondria, ideally isolated from non-ischemic tissue obtained from the patient’s own body. The origin of the mitochondria in this context is of primary concern, since, for example, mitochondria in the heart, skeletal muscle, and liver can differ in proteome and function. After injection of mitochondria into the target site, mitochondrial internalisation is largely dependent on cellular macropinocytosis. Studies of MTT in cell culture and animal models have provided promising results, but to date only one MTT-related study has been carried out in human subjects, a phase I clinical trial in paediatric cardiac patients with cardiac IRI [ 38 8. IRI and Coenzyme Q10 With regard to clinical studies, in a series of patients following heart transplant, Gvodzdjakova et al. [ 39 40 41 42 43 In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, another factor that may limit the successful organ transplantation is telomere shortening, when assessment of telomere length in the early post-transplant period allows prediction of long-term function of the transplanted organ [ 44 45 46 47 Regarding preclinical studies, in a rat model of liver transplantation, pretreatment of the donor rat with CoQ10 (10 mg/kg intravenous) 1 h before surgery was reported to protect against hepatic ischemia induced for 30 min at normothermic body temperature [ 48 49 3 50 Mitchell et al. [ 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 There is considerable evidence, from clinical and particularly preclinical studies, for the efficacy of supplemental CoQ10 in mediating IRI in situations other than organ transplantation. For example, in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery, pretreatment with CoQ10 reduced oxidative stress following cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp removal; the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during the recovery period was also reduced compared to non-supplemented controls [ 58 59 Table 1 Table 1 9. CoQ10 and Immunosuppression Tacrolimus is a widely used immunosuppressive agent for the prevention of allograft rejection after renal transplantation. However, major adverse effects of long-term administration of tacrolimus are progressive renal failure and new-onset diabetes mellitus. Using a rat model of tacrolimus-induced nephropathy, Yu et al. [ 81 82 83 84 85 Cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide are immunosuppressants used in organ transplantation, with renal or cardiac injury as an adverse effect. Supplementation with CoQ10 (5 mg/kg/day for 28 days) partially prevented cyclosporine-induced cardiotoxicity in rats [ 86 87 88 89 90 91 10. Discussion and Conclusions Ischaemic reperfusion injury is an unavoidable consequence of organ transplantation. In the present article, we have reviewed evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis/ferroptosis in IRI during transplantation, with consequences for transplanted organ failure. These data provide a rationale for the potential role of coenzyme Q10 in mediating IRI and promoting the viability of organs for transplantation, given the key role of CoQ10 in normal mitochondrial function, as an antioxidant protecting against ROS-induced cellular damage, and as an anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic/ferroptotic agent. One of the principal ways in which CoQ10 mediates oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis/ferroptosis is via its interaction with intracellular signalling pathways, most notably the Nrf2/NQO1/HO1, NF-κB, and P13K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of genes controlling the production of antioxidant enzymes, such as NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase (HO). Supplementary CoQ10 increases the levels of Nrf2, subsequently increasing antioxidant expression [ 92 93 94 Depletion of tissue CoQ10 levels has been associated with a variety of disorders, and the question arises as to how CoQ10 depletion may impact organ transplantation. To assess CoQ10 status, a plasma determination may be undertaken. However, the CoQ10 status of plasma has been reported to be influenced by both dietary supply and hepatic biosynthesis [ 95 95 95 Although the present review has focused on IRI and organ transplantation, factors other than IRI may be involved in transplantation outcome. Such factors include graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which occurs when donor immune cells attack tissues of the recipient, and may involve mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation in the latter [ 96 97 In summary, as listed in Table 1 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions D.M., N.C., T.T.P., and I.P.H. contributed equally to all aspects of the writing of this article.
