De‐identified data were analysed from persons who were screened for HCV antibody and/or tested for HCV RNA by two large U.S. commercial laboratories from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2021. Validated imputation algorithms were used to identify persons who initiated treatment and who achieved virological cure based on viral load decline and continued negative HCV RNA test results. The 3‐digit ZIP code was used to map treatment rates by U.S. state. During 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2021, a total of 46,646,661 persons were tested for HCV antibody of whom 2,253,500 (4.8%) were positive. Among 3,117,372 persons tested for HCV RNA, 1,951,742 (62.6%) were viremic. Cumulatively, a total of 672,745/1,951,742 (34.5%) viremic persons were treated; an estimated 643,043 (96%) were cured. Treatment rates increased with older age, higher fibrosis scores, HIV positivity, residing in an urban area and in the Northeast. Persons diagnosed by reflex testing had higher treatment rates. Comparing COVID‐19 pandemic (2021) to pre‐pandemic (2019) periods, 24% more HCV antibody tests were performed (10,167,524 vs. 7,727,318), but fewer persons were treated (21,136 vs. 26,124, 23% decline) and cured (19,584 vs. 24,480, 25.0% decline) in 2021, respectively. In 2021, primary care providers diagnosed and treated the greatest proportion of persons. Treatment uptake across the U.S. remains low, underscoring the need for additional measures to expand access to testing and treatment, necessary to reach the U.S. goals for HCV elimination by 2030. care cascade direct acting antiviral therapies elimination reflex testing screening AbbVie 10.13039/100006483 National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 10.13039/100000062 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date November 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  M.

Abbreviations CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention DAAs direct acting antivirals HCC hepatocellular carcinoma HCV hepatitis C virus HIV human immunodeficiency virus U.S United States USPSTF U.S. Preventive Services Task Force WHO World Health Organization 1 Introduction Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of premature mortality from cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and extra‐hepatic co‐morbidities. Globally, an estimated 50 million persons have chronic infection, resulting in 242,000 deaths annually [ 1 2 3 The high burden of HCV infection and related mortality coupled with the availability of curative therapies prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to set goals for the elimination of hepatitis C with implementation of prevention and care services to diagnose ≥ 90% and treat ≥ 80% of HCV infected persons [ 4 5 6 7 To track the effectiveness of these policy changes, data are needed to monitor the number of persons tested, diagnosed and treated for hepatitis C infection. However, because of limited capacity, few state and local public health systems collect these data. To meet this need, health officials have formed public‐private partnerships with commercial laboratories to collect and analyse de‐identified data from laboratory‐based testing for HCV. To assist the use of commercial laboratory data for HCV surveillance, the CDC developed an algorithm to monitor trends in screening for HCV antibody; HCV PCR testing; detection of HCV viremia and evidence of virologic cure. Using this algorithm, a CDC study of data collected from 2014 to 2021 by one large commercial laboratory revealed a substantial loss of patients moving across the HCV care cascade resulting in only approximately one third of persons diagnosed with an HCV infection receiving curative therapy [ 8 Two additional studies have examined data compiled from the records of two large commercial laboratories including the records from the commercial laboratory used in the CDC analysis [ 9 10 9 10 Data from the two commercial laboratories are now available for the years 2020 and 2021. We report the findings of an evaluation of the data set for the 2014–2021 HCV care cascade to explore trends in testing and treatment, including the type of clinical providers ordering the HCV PCR testing, and the impact of reflex HCV RNA testing on the diagnosis of HCV infection and receipt of HCV therapy. The data also provide the opportunity to assess the impact of the response to the COVID‐19 pandemic on HCV testing. 2 Methods 2.1 Data Source and Patient Population This study used a secondary, de‐identified dataset combined from two large U.S. laboratory companies (LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics) that provide HCV testing across all 51 U.S. states and territories (Puerto Rico and District of Columbia (D.C.)). This derived dataset represents the largest available HCV laboratory dataset in the U.S. Records of all adults who were screened for HCV antibody and/or tested for HCV RNA from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2021 were included in this analysis. Not all individuals had both HCV antibody and HCV RNA testing. HCV testing could be ordered as HCV antibody alone, HCV RNA alone, or reflex testing (i.e., if HCV antibody is detectable then HCV RNA is tested on the same blood sample). For this analysis, data to assess the selection of reflex testing was only available from one laboratory, LabCorp. Patient characteristics, including age (in years), sex (female, male, or unknown) and region of residence (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and West) were available for all individuals included in the analysis. To map HCV treatment rates by the U.S. state, an individual's region of residence was determined by the location of HCV RNA testing and detection of viremia (diagnosis) using the 3‐digit ZIP code. For individuals who tested positive for HCV RNA, additional information was retrieved from both laboratory datasets for the following variables: HCV genotype; urbanisation (rural or urban); human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis; laboratory results for calculation of the FIB‐4 score (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and platelets). To assess fibrosis stage, FIB‐4 scores were grouped as: minimal or none < 1.45, moderate 1.45 to 3.25, advanced > 3.25 [ 11 2.2 Algorithms for Treatment Receipt and Achievement of Sustained Virologic Response 2.2.1 Treatment Receipt Due to the lack of information on the treatment of hepatitis C and continuity of medical or pharmacy benefit enrollment in the derived dataset, receipt of HCV treatment and achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) (i.e., cure) was imputed using validated algorithms based on viral load decline and continued negative HCV RNA test results, respectively [ 9 10 9 9 2.2.2 Viremic Status Because individuals might have varied follow up duration and/or inconsistent HCV RNA measurements in the years from 2014 to 2021, a longitudinal method was applied to impute their HCV viremic status over multiple years. Individuals who had two positive HCV RNA values with gap years in between were assumed to stay HCV viremic in the gap years. 2.3 Observed Rates of HCV The number of persons screened for HCV antibody and the number who tested positive for HCV antibody or for HCV RNA were assessed for each year from 2014 to 2021. The proportion of individuals who were HCV antibody positive among all individuals tested for HCV antibody was calculated. 2.4  HCV HCV RNA Ordering of reflex testing (HCV antibody with reflex to HCV RNA) was identified using test numbers, test names, and by matching the test date (date the specimen was drawn) of the HCV antibody test with the date of the HCV RNA test. 2.5 Statistical Analysis This study was descriptive in nature. After retrieving and combining data from the two laboratory databases, observations were reported for the number of individuals in whom HCV antibody was tested, who were HCV antibody positive, persons tested for HCV RNA, HCV RNA positive, as well as those treated and cured individuals across the years 2014 to 2021 (henceforth termed the “HCV Care Cascade”). The HCV care cascade during this period was also reported based on sex and fibrosis stage categorisations. HCV cured individuals predicted from the machine learning algorithms were removed from each year's estimates. The total number of persons who remained HCV RNA positive and not cured was reported for the respective years between 2014 and 2021. To assess the impact of COVID‐19, changes in HCV treatment and cure rates between 2019 and 2021 were reported for HCV RNA tested, HCV RNA positive, treated (among those who tested HCV RNA+ in 2021), and cured individuals who had an HCV Ab+ test in 2021. The observed number of individuals who were HCV antibody screened, tested HCV antibody positive and tested HCV RNA positive was stratified by age for the year 2021. The proportion of RNA positive patients who were treated in 2021 were reported as a geographic heatmap of the 51 U.S. states and territories (Puerto Rico and D.C.). Observations of provider specialties that ordered the PCR test detecting HCV viremia and treated overall are reported for 2021. Ordering provider of the first positive RNA test in 2021 was assumed to be the diagnosing provider. Ordering provider of the RNA test with a decline of at least 1.2 × log 10 Means and standard deviations were reported for normally distributed continuous variables, medians and interquartile ranges for non‐normally distributed continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages (%) for categorical variables. All persons identified as RNA+ were included in the analysis. For demographical and clinical characteristics, persons with missing data in any field were not removed, but rather they were not counted toward the denominator and did not contribute to the percentage calculation for that characteristic. 2.6 Software Data cleaning and manipulation were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA). Machine learning algorithms were developed in R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Compliance with Ethics Guidelines. 2.7 Compliance With Ethics Guidelines With permission from Symphony Health, an ICON plc Company, PatientSource (for LabCorp data) and Quest Diagnostics, this study utilised de‐identified retrospective data from two U.S. laboratory datasets. Because the data were de‐identified, no ethics committee approval was required. Additionally, as this study is based on laboratory data, it does not contain any new studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors. 3 Results During the period January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2021, a total of 46,646,661 individuals were tested for hepatitis C antibody at the two nationwide commercial laboratories. Of the individuals tested, 2,253,500 (4.8%) were HCV antibody positive. During the same period, 3,117,372 persons were tested for HCV RNA and 1,951,742 (62.6%) were viremic (Figure 1 2 2 1 FIGURE 1 HCV care cascade, 2014–2021 cumulative.

FIGURE 2 (a) Ordering of HCV Ab with reflex to HCV RNA testing among HCV tested adults in the US, 2014–2021. Ordering of reflex testing (HCV Antibody with reflex to RNA test) was identified using test numbers, test names, and by matching the test date (date the specimen was drawn) of the Antibody test with that of the RNA test. Reflex testing analyses are only available with data from one large US national laboratory. (b) Association of Reflex Testing, 2014–2021. Reflex testing (HCV Antibody with reflex to RNA test) was identified by matching the test date (date the specimen was drawn) of the Antibody test with that of the RNA test. Reflex testing analyses are only available with data from one large US national laboratory. Percent treated for individuals for whom Ab and RNA testing were ordered separately may be underestimated due to inclusion of those who may not have a confirmed RNA+ test result.

An estimated 643,043 (96%) were cured of their HCV infection (Figure 1 S1 S1a S1 S1b S1 S1c S1 S2 1 2 2 In 2021, the most recent year of observation, a total of 10,167,524 persons were tested for HCV antibody, of whom 407,795 (4%) were positive; 284,220 persons were tested for HCV RNA, of whom 165,142 (58.1%) were positive.

More positively, the analysis revealed 96% of persons treated were cured of their HCV infection. The data from this analysis are consistent with results of a CDC analysis of the HCV care cascade, using data from a single national laboratory (Quest Diagnostics), reporting that only 33% of individuals with chronic HCV infection have been cured [ 8 13 Similar to previous results, the greatest number of positive HCV antibody tests was found in two age groups, 30–39 years and 60–64 years. The peak among younger individuals likely represents infections associated with the emergence of the opioid epidemic and increase in injection drug use and supports the CDC 2020 recommendations to expand HCV screening to all adults 18 and older. The second peak corresponds to CDC‐defined risk for people born 1945 through 1965 (“birth cohort”) with greater risk for nosocomial transmission prior to HCV viral discovery and implementation of blood bank screening and other prevention measures. However, while screening increased in 2021 in our cohort, there was a 25% decrease in the number of persons being treated and cured suggesting continued limitations in access to HCV treatment, possibly an adverse consequence of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Although treatment rates were higher among persons with advanced fibrosis and HIV, likely reflecting the greater urgency for treatment in these populations, < 50% of persons with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis received treatment. This is a subgroup that should be targeted for urgent therapy due to the increased risk for progression to decompensation or HCC. Notably, reflex testing for HCV RNA of HCV antibody positive specimens was associated with higher rates of linkage to care and shortened duration of time from detection of HCV viremia to treatment. Additionally, in 2021, there appeared to be a shift in health providers who were performing testing and prescribing treatment, from specialists to primary care providers, with the latter treating almost 60% of persons with active infection. This shift in healthcare providers from specialists to primary care may alleviate the shortage of providers. However, the marked geographical differences in the rate of treatment uptake across the U.S. with a noted urban–rural divide, findings similar to the CDC analysis, suggest that health system barriers remain [ 13 14 15 The commercial laboratory data contrast sharply with that from the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) which has implemented strategies to successfully test more than 80% of the 1945–1965 birth cohort, and treat > 80% of HCV RNA positive patients with a documented cure rate > 90% [ 16 17 To counter the low rate of HCV treatment nationally, key U.S. stakeholders proposed a National HCV Elimination Plan in 2023–2024 [ 18 Obtaining data to derive the care cascade remains a challenge. States are required to report HCV cases through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. However, many states underreport HCV cases due to limited resources, asymptomatic infections, lack of access to healthcare and limitations in surveillance systems. Our analysis suggests that despite recognised limitations, data from commercial laboratories can provide useful information on the care cascade to inform progress on HCV elimination. Our analysis has several strengths. There was large coverage of the U.S. population, including data collected from all 51 states and territories, through two datasets providing robustness and generalisability of the findings. The ability to evaluate trends between pre‐pandemic and pandemic periods identified areas for improvement for meeting WHO targets. However, the two commercial laboratories do not represent all persons tested for HCV over the observation period. Data on drug prescriptions are lacking and results on individual treatment initiation and “cure” had to be inferred using an algorithm relying on decline of HCV RNA. However, the validity of this algorithm has been confirmed [ 13 In conclusion, data based on two large commercial laboratories indicate that only slightly more than one third of individuals with diagnosed HCV infection were treated for their HCV infection from 2014 to 2021. For the U.S. to reach goals for HCV elimination, linkage to treatment for persons diagnosed with HCV infection must improve. Our analysis suggests that several simple measures may provide large dividends in the U.S. elimination efforts. These include expanding, through training, the number of primary care providers treating HCV infection, removal of restrictions to accessing treatment [ 19 20 Author Contributions M.G.G., J.W.W. and T.R.M.: study concept and design; analysis and interpretation of data; drafting of the manuscript; critical revision for intellectual content.
