Abstract Introduction Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is the most common cause of scarring alopecia in middle-aged black women. Trichoscopy is a noninvasive tool for diagnosis and follow-up of hair and scalp disorders. To date, limited studies have focused on its applicability to CCCA in existing literature. Methods The present study aimed to describe the trichoscopic findings of 11 dark-skinned women with confirmed CCCA and provide a comprehensive discussion of our current knowledge regarding trichoscopy of this disease through a literature review. A thorough understanding of CCCA trichoscopy holds significant promise for early confirmation and treatment. Conclusion By doing so, it is possible to mitigate the development of complications and alleviate the subsequent impact on patients’ quality of life.
