However, medical therapy has an established role in treatment when patients are not surgical candidates or decline surgery, residual or recurrent disease is present and not amenable to repeat resection, and control of hypercortisolism is needed either preoperatively or while awaiting the effects of radiotherapy. The approach to medical therapy should be tailored based on the etiology, degree of hypercortisolism, and patient characteristics. Currently available medical therapy for all etiologies of CS either blocks adrenal production of cortisol or blocks its action at the level of the glucocorticoid receptor. Currently available medical therapy for Cushing’s disease (CD) targets the adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary tumor through activation of somatostatin and dopamine receptors, alkylating DNA damage, or immune system activation. More focused therapy with greater efficacy and fewer adverse effects is needed, particularly in the case of CD, with potential targets and drugs identified and in development. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025 Key Points  Medical therapy is needed for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome (CS) when patients are not candidates for or decline surgery, when residual or recurrent disease is present and inoperable, and when control of hypercortisolism is needed preoperatively or while awaiting the effects of radiotherapy. Currently available medical therapy for CS falls into three classes of medications: pituitary-directed agents, steroidogenesis inhibitors, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists. With respect to Cushing’s disease, novel therapy is needed with new drugs under investigation targeting the adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor and genetic alterations associated with the corticotroph adenoma. Introduction Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is a serious medical condition resulting from chronic hypercortisolism with a wide range of metabolic, cardiovascular, immune, thrombotic, and neuropsychiatric morbidities [ 1 2 1 3 5 1 6 7 7 7 8 8 9 8 9 Drug Categories Pituitary-Targeting Therapy Currently available drugs for treatment of CD targeting the corticotroph adenoma activate somatostatin and dopamine receptors, cause alkylating damage, or activate the immune system against it (Table 1 8 10 Table 1 Drugs targeting the corticotroph adenoma for treatment of Cushing’s disease (CD) Drug Dose Efficacy Evaluation before treatment initiation Main adverse effects (%) Pasireotide a,b Initial dosing: SC 0.6–0.9 mg BID Dosage titration: dose elevation for patients started on 0.6 mg BID to 0.9 mg BID according to treatment response in 2 months according to tolerability [ 217 15% and 26% of patients (600 or 900 µg BID, respectively) had UFC ≤ ULN after 6 months of treatment [ 13 15 Baseline levels of serum glucose, HbA1c, liver function tests, serum potassium, and serum magnesium Electrocardiogram [ 217 Diarrhea (58%), nausea (52%), hyperglycemia (40%), cholelithiasis (30%), headache (28%), abdominal pain (24%), injection site reactions (17%), transaminitis (10%), QT prolongation (6%), bradycardia (< 5%) [ 217 Pasireotide LAR a,b Initial dosing: IM 10 mg once monthly Dosage titration: according to tolerability and treatment response [ 218 28.4–37% of patients achieved UFC normalization after 7 months of treatment [ 16 17 Baseline levels of serum glucose, HbA1c, liver function tests, serum potassium, and serum magnesium Electrocardiogram [ 218 Hyperglycemia (39.5%), diarrhea (34.6%), cholelithiasis (28.4%), nausea (22.2%), diabetes mellitus (18.5%), nasopharyngitis (17.3%), and abdominal pain (14.8%) [ 17 Cabergoline Dosage range as reported in the literature: PO 0.5–7 mg weekly typically in two divided doses, administered at bedtime, typical starting dose 0.5 mg BIW.

Importantly, to date, no prospective, randomized, head-to-head studies comparing the effectiveness and safety of steroidogenesis inhibitors are available. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole inhibits multiple steroidogenic enzymes including CYP17A1, CYP11A1, and CYP11B1 [ 56 57 58 59 58 60 7 56 7 6 54 Levoketoconazole As opposed to ketoconazole, which is a mix of two enantiomers ( l d l 61 62 54 61 62 Metyrapone Metyrapone, which mainly inhibits CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 [ 56 63 64 65 66 56 67 68 56 55 Osilodrostat Osilodrostat inhibits CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 activity with an enhanced potency and prolonged half-life compared to metyrapone [ 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 69 73 77 78 71 79 80 81 Etomidate Etomidate is an anesthetic drug administered intravenously, which rapidly inhibits CYP11B1 and can be used for short-term treatment when the oral route is impossible. Several protocols using a titration procedure or a “block and replace” regimen have been described [ 82 84 Mitotane Mitotane is an adrenolytic drug used for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). At relatively moderate dosage (2–3 g per day), mitotane inhibits multiple steroidogenic enzymes, ultimately leading to AI requiring hydrocortisone supplementation [ 85 85 86 7 Glucocorticoid Receptor Antagonists Medical therapy targeting the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in CS represents a potential management tool, irrespective of the etiology of hypercortisolism, in which the goal is not to decrease cortisol secretion but rather blunt its effects through GR blockade (Table 3 6 Table 3 Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists for treatment of Cushing’s syndrome (CS) Drug Dose Efficacy Evaluation before treatment initiation Main adverse effects (%) Mifepristone a Initial dosing: PO 300 mg once daily Dosage titration: 300 mg increments every 2–4 weeks Dose range: 300–1200 mg once daily (maximum 600 mg once daily in renal impairment and mild to moderate hepatic impairment, use in severe hepatic impairment not recommended) Should be taken with food [ 90 In SEISMIC, there was a 25% or greater decrease in area under the curve for glucose on oral glucose tolerance testing in 60% of patients with T2DM/IGT and a 5 mmHg or greater decrease in diastolic blood pressure in 38% of patents with hypertension [ 93 Additional improvements were seen in weight, waist circumference, depression, cognition, and quality of life leading to overall clinical improvement in 87% [ 93 Baseline blood pressure, serum glucose, HbA1c, serum potassium, serum creatinine, liver function tests, electrocardiogram, pregnancy test in female patients of reproductive potential, and thyroid function tests [ 89 90 92 89 92 Nausea (48%), fatigue (48%), hypokalemia (44%), headache (44%), endometrial thickening (38%), arthralgia (30%), vomiting (26%), peripheral edema (26%), hypertension (24%), dizziness (22%), decreased appetite (20%), adrenal insufficiency (17%), vaginal bleeding (14%) [ 93 94 Relacorilant 100–400 mg once daily [ 98 100 In GRACE, mean decrease in systolic blood pressure of 7.9 mmHg and in diastolic blood pressure of 5.4 mmHg, mean decrease in area under the curve for glucose on glucose tolerance testing of − 3.3 h*mmol/L and mean decrease in HbA1c of 0.3 [ 101 Baseline blood pressure, serum glucose, HbA1c, and serum potassium Nausea (34%), peripheral edema (33%), extremity pain (30%), back pain (27%), fatigue (22%), and arthralgia (20%) [ 102 HbA1c IGT PO T2DM a Mifepristone Mifepristone is an oral, nonselective progesterone receptor (PR) and GR antagonist with an affinity for the GR approximately 10-fold and 4-fold higher than that of cortisol and dexamethasone, respectively [ 6 87 89 6 90 91 89 92 Over the past 15 years, clinical studies and trials have established mifepristone’s efficacy in the treatment of CS while highlighting its possible adverse effects and important clinical considerations [ 6 89 92 93 93 93 94 The most common adverse effects of mifepristone relate to its underlying mechanism of GR and PR blockade [ 89 93 95 92 6 89 89 93 96 97 Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication with a negative pregnancy test required before treatment initiation in female patients of reproductive potential and in the event of therapy interruption for greater than 14 days [ 90 89 92 89 90 89 90 92 Relacorilant Relacorilant is a novel, oral, selective GR antagonist without significant affinity for the PR currently undergoing clinical investigation for use in CS [ 6 98 98 99 The phase 3 Glucocorticoid Receptor Antagonism in the Treatment of Cushing Syndrome (GRACE) study with 152 participants with CS (~ 78% ACTH-dependent) with hypertension and/or T2DM/IGT consisted of an initial 22-week, open-label phase of relacorilant 100 mg daily titrated up to 400 mg daily as tolerated followed by a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal phase in which those participants meeting clinical response criteria at the end of the open-label phase received either placebo or continued relacorilant at the same dose [ 100 101 101 101 102 102 102 102 103 1 Fig. 1 Medical therapy for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome. The three main classes of medications are pituitary-directed agents, steroidogenesis inhibitors, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonists. Pasireotide preferentially binds to somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5) compared to somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2), while cabergoline activates dopamine receptor type 2 (D2R) in the corticotroph tumors decreasing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion. Ketoconazole, levoketoconazole, osilodrostat, metyrapone, etomidate, and mitotane decrease cortisol synthesis by inhibiting different enzymes in the adrenal steroidogenesis pathway. Each steroidogenesis inhibitor is bolded over their principal sites of action. Mifepristone and the newer drug relacorilant are competitive glucocorticoid receptor antagonists and exert their effects by blocking the biological effects rather than secretion of cortisol. While mifepristone is a competitive progesterone receptor antagonist, relacorilant is a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator with no progesterone activity Medical Therapy According to Etiology Cushing’s Syndrome Based on Corticotroph Adenomas Although CD should be treated ideally with drugs targeting the corticotroph adenoma, medical therapy for these patients usually starts with steroidogenesis inhibitors due to the mild-moderate efficacy and potential side effects of pituitary-targeting drugs [ 2 9 13 16 19 9 13 71 72 In patients with moderate-severe hypercortisolism, there is rationale for combination therapy with drugs with complimentary mechanisms of action or combination therapy with pituitary- and adrenal-targeting drugs, which might offer higher rates of long-term remission with lower medication doses and less AEs [ 27 12 104 11 105 11 105 25 27 29 11 As outlined in the section Pituitary-Targeting Therapy, temozolomide and immunotherapy can be used for patients with aggressive corticotroph tumors. Successful treatment of aggressive corticotroph adenomas and carcinomas with temozolomide in combination with pasireotide has been reported. In one case of a widely metastatic ACTH-secreting pituitary carcinoma refractory to repeated surgical intervention, bilateral adrenalectomy, medical therapy, and radiotherapy, combination therapy with temozolomide and pasireotide for 12 months followed by pasireotide monotherapy for 9 months was associated with successful tumor stabilization and control of ACTH secretion [ 106 107 In summary, targeting SSTR5 and D2R with pasireotide and cabergoline, respectively, either alone or in combination, is a rational therapy directed to the disease etiology but not effective in all patients, in particular those with more severe hypercortisolism. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new, innovative pituitary-targeting drugs. Potential targets and compounds are discussed in the section New Targets, New Drugs. Cushing’s Syndrome Based on Adrenal Neoplasias Benign Tumors and Hyperplasia In patients with unilateral adrenal adenoma and CS in whom unilateral adrenalectomy is delayed by an underlying condition, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors can be used to control cortisol excess until surgery is possible [ 108 109 67 67 67 110 67 71 111 80 81 111 113 Control of Cortisol Excess in ACC In a significant proportion of patients with initial ACC or recurrent advanced disease, important cortisol excess can occur and requires vigorous therapy to reduce potential life-threatening morbidities, such as severe infection, thromboembolic disease, hypokalemia, and cardiometabolic complications; in addition, deleterious effect of hypercortisolism on the tumor immune environment confers worst tumor prognosis and response to systemic therapies [ 114 115 114 116 114 116 117 114 116 118 119 114 116 In patients with extreme hypercortisolism, other adrenal enzyme inhibitors are required in addition to mitotane [ 114 116 114 116 120 76 71 121 114 116 Therapy of Primary Bilateral Pigmented Micronodular Adrenal Dysplasia (PPNAD) or Primary Bilateral Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia (PBMAH) Patients with Excess Cortisol Secretion Usually, in the young patients with PPNAD and CS with or without Carney complex, bilateral adrenalectomy has been the most frequently utilized therapy requiring lifelong steroid replacement; only rarely was unilateral adrenalectomy successful in very mild cases [ 122 124 125 126 127 In patients with PBMAH and overt CS with elevated UFC, therapy is needed and includes adrenal surgery as first-line in most patients [ 7 108 128 129 129 130 131 129 136 135 Medical Therapy for PBMAH Adrenal enzyme inhibitors such as ketoconazole and metyrapone can be efficient before adrenalectomy when severe hypercortisolism results in life-threatening morbidities, or when there is recurrence of hypercortisolism following unilateral adrenalectomy and completion adrenalectomy is not pursued [ 10 131 137 138 139 64 140 141 142 143 144 145 In a small series of four PBMAH patients with CS, the competitive GR and PR antagonist mifepristone induced clinical remission and reduced excess cortisol comorbidities in a median time of 5 months with fatigue as the most common side effect [ 146 Specific Pharmacological Therapies Targeting Aberrant Hormone Receptors As cortisol secretion is regulated by aberrantly expressed G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in 77–87% of PBMAH patients with modest or overt CS [ 129 147 2 148 152 129 153 155 129 156 159 160 129 159 161 162 163 129 160 164 168 169 Fig. 2 Eutopic and ectopic hormone receptor expression in primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH). While independent of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol secretion in PBMAH is governed by autocrine and paracrine signaling with the effect of activating the adenyl cyclase pathway via aberrantly expressed eutopic and ectopic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ectopic ACTH production by the PBMAH cell activates its own or adjacent cell’s melanocortin type 2 receptor (MC2R). Increased mast cells produce serotonin (5-HT) which activates the serotonin type 4 receptor (HTR4) and type 7 receptor (HTR7). Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) stimulates the arginine-vasopressin (AVP) receptor type I (AVPR1). In some ARMC5 KDM1A The arginine-vasopressin (AVP) receptor type I (AVPR1) and serotonin type 4 receptor (HTR4) are the two most prevalent aberrant GPCR regulating cortisol secretion in patients with PBMAH, but unfortunately, there are currently no available antagonists for these receptors [ 129 147 162 129 Cushing’s Syndrome Based on Ectopic ACTH Syndrome Cushing’s syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion (EAS) is a severe condition associated with intense hypercortisolism in most cases [ 170 171 172 172 173 170 Several therapeutic options can be used to control or reduce hypercortisolism, including surgical excision of non-metastatic tumors, antineoplastic chemotherapy for metastatic tumors, pharmacotherapy, and bilateral adrenalectomy. These options should be discussed within an experienced multidisciplinary team according to the patient’s condition. However, and as recommended by the Endocrine Society, thanks to their effectiveness and rapidity of action, steroidogenesis inhibitors should be used as primary treatment [ 7 54 54 68 174 176 The steroidogenesis inhibitor etomidate has been successfully used in the short term and commonly produces a dramatic decrease in cortisol levels within 24–48 h. Given its intravenous administration, it may be useful when the oral route is not possible, such as in patients with vomiting, unmanageable symptoms (such as respiratory failure), or in patients with steroid psychosis [ 82 84 170 Ketoconazole monotherapy has been used successfully in patients with EAS, although high doses (1000–1600 mg) are usually required and the rate of control of hypercortisolism is lower than in CD [ 170 177 178 179 In EAS, monotherapy with metyrapone has been more frequently reported than with ketoconazole and appears to be successful in the majority of cases [ 7 64 66 180 66 Since metyrapone and ketoconazole inhibit distinct steroidogenic enzymes, their synergistic action can be used to effectively treat intense hypercortisolism. In a published series of 14 cases of intense EAS, administration of high doses of these drugs (median starting doses of 2500 mg daily of metyrapone and of 1000 mg daily of ketoconazole), induced a decrease in median UFC, from 40 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal, after 1 week of treatment with 50% of patients showing normalized UFC [ 120 110 86 86 The recently introduced steroidogenesis inhibitor osilodrostat demonstrated efficacy in a retrospective French series of 33 patients with EAS and intense hypercortisolism [ 75 Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are an alternative to steroidogenesis inhibitors in the specific situation where a metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma is responsible for EAS, since they may rapidly and fully control ACTH secretion (and consequently cortisol production) independent of a reduction in tumor size [ 170 181 181 182 RET 183 184 7 170 170 173 121 121 New Targets, New Drugs Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of pituitary adenomas has identified potential novel pituitary-directed targets for the treatment of corticotroph adenomas. ACTH Receptor-Blocking Drugs Blockade of the effect of excessive ACTH secretion in ACTH-dependent CS is an attractive option for the treatment of CD. Recently, several novel ACTH receptor, also known as melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R), antagonists have been developed and tested in vitro and in vivo. In an experimental AtT20 rat xenograft model of CD, as well as in a model with continuous ACTH administration, the nonpeptide selective ACTH antagonist CRN04894 185 186 CRN04894 NCT05804669 187 NCT05907291 188 Another ACTH-blocking drug, a monoclonal antibody preventing the binding of ACTH to MC2R (ALD1613), has potent and sustained ACTH-blocking effects in vitro and in vivo in rats (mice) and monkeys [ 189 190 Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 8 (USP8) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Inhibition Gain-of-function mutations in USP8 191 192 USP8 193 194 195 196 Two EGFR TKIs (gefitinib and lapatinib) were shown to inhibit corticotroph tumor size and proliferation, as well as POMC expression and ACTH secretion in vitro and in vivo [ 194 197 USP8 NCT02484755 USP8 198 199 USP8 USP8 200 Cyclin E Inhibition Selective increased expression of cyclin E has been found in corticotroph adenomas [ 201 202 203 204 Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) Inhibition It is well documented that the chaperone HSP90 induces conformational changes of the GR resulting in altered transcriptional activity of the receptor. Moreover, increased expression of HSP90 is found in corticotroph adenomas, which may prevent functional activation of the GR [ 205 205 206 208 209 Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibitors Many tumor types have aberrant histone modifications which can be involved in tumor initiation, tumor progression, metastasis, and sensitivity to drug treatment [ 210 211 Targeting Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Retinoic acid (RA) binds with high affinity to the RAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR). RA inhibits POMC expression as well as ACTH and cortisol secretion and induces an upregulation of D2R expression in several experimental models of CD in vitro and in vivo [ 212 214 215 216 To summarize, in the development and testing of novel drugs and drug targets in CD, promising data from experimental models of CD exist. However, most of the novel drugs have not yet reached clinical testing of their effectiveness. While promising effects of RA have been demonstrated in experimental models of CD, RA does not appear that effective in patients with CD. On the other hand, the effects of MC2R antagonists in CD seem promising. Conclusion Medical therapy in CS is needed when patients are not candidates for or decline surgical intervention, there is residual or recurrent disease following surgery especially when repeat intervention is not possible or pursued, and finally, when used as bridge therapy preoperatively or while awaiting the effects of radiotherapy. Currently available medical therapy targets the corticotroph adenoma in cases of CD, acts to inhibit steroidogenesis at the level of the adrenal glands, or blocks cortisol’s effects via GR antagonism. Medical therapy is tailored based on the source and degree of hypercortisolism as well as patient characteristics.
