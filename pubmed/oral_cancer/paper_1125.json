Thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) is involved in metabolic pathways that promote lipolysis, which can prevent the accumulation of liver fat. As a possible treatment for NAFLD, this in silico study examines the binding interactions between THRA and polyphenols and flavonoids present in fruits and vegetables. Including caffeic acid, curcumin, and chlorogenic acid, the binding affinities of the natural substances to THRA were found comparable to the hormone T3, boosting the THRA–TRAP220 complex, promoting fatty acid oxidation, while decreasing lipid accumulation in the liver.

Introduction Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic disorder mainly characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in the hepatocytes [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 3 4 6 According to the report of the International Consensus Panel on NAFLD/NASH published in 2023, the term NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) has been replaced by the term MASLD (Metabolic Associated Steatotic Liver Disease), as the latter better reflects the metabolic dysfunction underlying the disease [ 9 There is compelling evidence that the selective activation of hepatic thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) effectively prevents fat accumulation in the liver. This finding proposes a novel treatment strategy for NAFLD by enhancing hepatic fat oxidation [ 10 11 12 13 14 THRA functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor, activated by 3,5,3′-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), the biologically active form of thyroid hormone, modulating the expression of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation [ 15 16 13 17 2. Materials and Methods The structure of THRA receptor was extracted from AlphaFold database ( https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/ 18 P10827 https://galaxy.seoklab.org/ 19 https://www.schrodinger.com/ https://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=WKGB 20 Polyphenolic structures and T3 in the canonical SMILES format were extracted from the PubChem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 21 http://openbabel.org 22 https://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=7TM 23 https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/ 24 http://hex.loria.fr/ 25 To ensure the reliability of our docking protocol, and based on modern guides for reliable docking methods [ 26 https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P10827 For the docking analysis, the GalaxyWeb software was used, taking the corresponding receptor sequence derived from relevant structures and replacing the natural ligand with the corresponding counterpart in each structure. Specifically, the sequence of each crystal structure was imported into GalaxyTBM ( https://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=TBM 27 http://openbabel.org 22 https://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=7TM 23 The UCSF Chimera program ( https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/ 24 The online program SwissDock ( https://www.swissdock.ch/ 28 29 30 https://www.schrodinger.com/platform/products/glide/ https://life.bsc.es/pid/pydockweb 31 Prime program of the Schrödinger suite ( https://www.schrodinger.com/platform/products/prime/ 32 The online program SwissADME ( www.swissadme.ch 3. Results Comparative analysis between docked and experimental crystal structures showed a high level of agreement, measured through low Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values. The comparison of each crystal structure with the corresponding model from docking protocol is presented in Supplementary Figure S1 The structures of the compounds used in the present study are presented in Figure 1 Figure 1 The chemical structures of natural products used in the present study. Figure 2 218 222 225 256 259 260 263 276 277 292 299 395 403 Figure 2 The hydrasized binding pocket of THRA receptor with the natural products. 218 222 225 256 259 260 263 276 277 292 299 395 403 Figure 3 Ιn addition, comparing the binding positions of T3 and natural compounds is important. This analysis suggests that these compounds bind to the same region of the receptor, with their chemical groups oriented in a similar manner to that of T3. The orientation is depicted in Figure 4 Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 Supplementary Figure S4 Figure 3 Comparison of the amino acid residues and 3D conformation in the binding groove of ΤHRA receptor after binding of the T3 (light blue) and the natural products. The arrangement of THRA receptor amino acids 350–400, which are located at the C-Terminal of the receptor, is critical for their binding to the TRAP220 receptor. As shown in Table 1 Figure 5 Table 1 To provide a clearer overview of the pharmacokinetic profiles, critical parameters calculated using the application of SwissADME ( www.swissadme.ch Table 2 Supplementary Table S3 4. Discussion Thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) plays a major role in lipid and glucose metabolism. Its activity is crucial in prevention of metabolic NAFLD [ 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 40 40 40 Natural products, especially flavonoids, provide a promising alternative or complementary treatment for NAFLD [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 42 46 42 46 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 48 Peaches ( Prunus persica 50 51 52 53 54 55 54 55 56 From a biochemical perspective, nutrients of peach can influence lipid metabolism and inhibit lipotoxicity by modulating key cellular pathways that regulate fat storage and breakdown, including those regulated by THRA. Methyl 4-hydroxycinnamate, p-Coumaric acid, and 2-hydroxycinnamate, as dietary polyphenols with low toxicity, have been proposed as potential drugs for treatment of NAFLD [ 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 All compounds presented in this study showed an interesting pharmacokinetic character. Using the online resource SwissADME ( www.swissadme.ch Table 2 Supplementary Table S3 69 69 69 It has been found that there is a well-documented binding site for a second T3 molecule in the THRA receptor [ 70 An important contribution of this work lies in the novel integration of different computational layers to study the THRA pathway. While existing research proposed the polyphenol modulation of nuclear receptors previously, the current work specifically highlights their role in support of the THRA–TRAP220 interaction as a molecular event that enables lipolysis. To our knowledge, this work provides the first docking analysis to comprehensively study peach polyphenols in this context. Furthermore, by combining receptor–ligand docking, protein–protein docking, validation against experimental crystal structures, and pharmacokinetic profiling, we provide a comprehensive in silico structure for facilitating the reliability of predictions. These factors in combination overcome earlier docking-focused speculations and open up novel possibilities for experimental validation in the context of THRA-targeted nutraceuticals for NAFLD. A critical aspect in considering THRA as a therapeutic target is the selectivity of the binding of the ligands. While the results in this study indicate that the polyphenols investigated possess a similarity to T3 in binding to THRA, the overall activation of thyroid receptors may also be influenced by Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta (THRB) or by other nuclear receptors such as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ), leading to off-target metabolic effects [ 14 35 71 72 73 35 A further limitation of our study is that the predicted results are determined by ligand concentrations in the receptor site and may not be attained through conventional diet-based ingestion. Molecules such as quercetin or chlorogenic acid are rapidly metabolized and possess limited in vivo bioavailability. The needed hepatic levels to elicit considerable THRA modulation are therefore likely to be attained through diet alone. This highlights the need for future studies exploring optimized formulations, delivery systems, or synthetic analogs with improved pharmacokinetic properties to enable potential therapeutic applications. 5. Conclusions The results of the present study demonstrate that several natural polyphenols, particularly those abundant in fruits such as peaches, display favorable predicted binding affinity for THRA and promote its interaction with TRAP220 in silico. These findings provide a computational framework for screening candidate molecules for future experimental validation. While our data support the hypothesis that modification of THRA by natural products could contribute to the reduction in hepatic lipid accumulation, these results remain predictive and need to be confirmed through in vitro assays, in vivo models, and ultimately clinical studies before any therapeutic application can be established. Therefore, the present work should be considered as a starting point for further mechanistic investigations on dietary or pharmacological interventions targeting THRA for NAFLD.
