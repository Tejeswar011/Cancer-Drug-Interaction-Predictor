Study Design: This was an in vitro experimental study. Setting: This study was conducted in a biofilm research laboratory in an academic medical center. Methods: Sterile fluoroplastic TTs were coated with SRV-CIPRO or placebo varnish. A novel tympanic membrane (TM) model was developed using a layered agar–plastic system. Antibacterial activity, biofilm inhibition, and bacterial viability were assessed through agar diffusion, MTT, ATP quantification, HR-SEM, and SD-CLSM. Results: SRV-CIPRO-coated TTs exhibited sustained antibacterial activity for up to 10 days. Compared to the placebo, SRV-CIPRO significantly inhibited biofilm formation, reduced metabolic activity, and decreased bacterial viability ( p otitis media with effusion (OME) tympanostomy tubes (TTs) ciprofloxacin sustained-release varnish (SRV) biofilm formation Pseudomonas aeruginosa postoperative otorrhea localized antibiotic delivery otolaryngology This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a common condition affecting the middle ear, particularly in children. It is a leading cause of conductive hearing loss and contributes to developmental and speech delays, resulting in poor school performance and developmental challenges [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus Ciprofloxacin, a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, in ear-drop form is commonly used as prophylactic treatment following the insertion of TTs to prevent early TTO [ 17 18 P. aeruginosa 19 S. aureus 20 21 22 23 24 Sustained-release delivery systems are technologies that allow a controlled and prolonged release of a drug. Varnishes are liquid pharmaceutical preparations that are applied to a surface and when they are dry, leave a thin film coating. Sustained-release varnish (SRV) allows for a controlled release rate of the drug, allowing for longer term effects. The general pharmaceutical formulation of a varnish consists of polymers, pharmaceutical release controllers, and active agents, dissolved or mixed in a suitable solvent. Various types of SRVs have been proposed and tested [ 25 In this study, we have developed a novel technology for coating TTs with an SRV containing ciprofloxacin (SRV-CIPRO) to abrogate biofilm formation on both the TTs and the surrounding environment, and evaluated the effect of this combination using an innovative tympanic membrane model for TT insertion. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Preparation of Sustained-Release Varnish (SRV) The SRV containing ciprofloxacin (SRV-CIPRO) was formulated using a modified method based on Friedman et al. [ 26 2.2. Tympanostomy Tubes (TTs) Various sizes of tympanostomy tubes are available on the market; however, for this study, sterile fluoroplastic tubes (GRACE Medical, Memphis, TN, USA), with an inner diameter of 1.14 mm, and uniform shape and weight, were used ( Figure 1 2.3. Coating of Tympanostomy Tubes Sterile TTs were coated via the dipping coat immersion method, either with the SRV-CIPRO or SRV-placebo formulations. After the immersion procedure, the coated tubes were air-dried at room temperature for 24 h. This process was repeated three times to ensure consistent coating. The amount of SRV-CIPRO applied was quantified by weighing the tubes before and after coating. This study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of SRV-CIPRO versus SRV-placebo. 2.4. Bacterial Strain The bacterial strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa 600nm 2.5. Biofilm Model TTs coated with SRV-CIPRO or SRV-placebo were placed in test tubes containing 3 mL of TSB supplemented with 1% glucose (TSBG) and inoculated with 30 µL of overnight standardized P. aeruginosa 2.6. Tympanic Membrane Model for TTs Insertion We aimed to develop a model of the tympanic membrane (TM) mimicking the structural and functional properties of the human TM. This model serves as a platform for evaluating the insertion and performance of TTs under conditions simulating the human middle ear environment. To construct the model, we utilized a round sterile plate as the base, over which a layer of transparent plastic roll was applied. The plastic roll, sterilized with ethanol, serves as the foundational layer that mimicked a human TM’s flexibility and translucency. To further replicate the biological structure, we covered the plastic roll with a thin layer of Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) cut into a round or oval shape, resembling the shape and dimensions of the human TM. Fresh bacteria were then added to the model. A small incision was then made in both layers (the TSA agar and the plastic roll) to create an opening for the insertion of the TM ( Figure 2 2.7. Kinetics Studies 2.7.1. Kinetic Diffusion Sensitivity Test Using our TM model, we inserted SRV-CIPRO- or SRV-placebo-coated tubes daily in the bilayer model, in which the Tryptic Soy Agar was pre-seeded with P. aeruginosa 27 2 2.7.2. Effect on Planktonic Bacterial Growth TTs were incubated daily in 3 mL of TSBG medium with 30 µL of an overnight bacterial culture for 24 h. The optical density (OD) at 600 nm was measured, and the bacterial concentration in the supernatant–fluid was determined. Control experiments involved TSBG incubated with the tubes in the absence of bacteria. The turbidity induced by CIPRO in the medium was considered. 2.7.3. Biofilm Metabolic Assay The metabolic activity of biofilms was measured daily using the MTT method [ 28 570 2.7.4. BacTiter-Glo TM The BacTiter-Glo TM TM 29 2.7.5. High-Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (HR-SEM) Biofilm formation on TT samples was prepared as described above. The biofilms were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and twice with distilled deionized water (DDW) before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After fixation, the samples were washed with DDW, dried, coated with iridium, and visualized using a MagellanTM 400L High-Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA), with magnifications ranging from 200× to 20,000× [ 26 2.7.6. Spinning Disk Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (SDCLSM) Biofilms were prepared as described above. After rinsing, the biofilms were stained with SYTO 9 and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescent dyes (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min in the dark [ 30 P. aeruginosa 2.8. Statistical Analysis The statistical mean of three or four independent experiments was calculated (for each experiment we evaluated at least 3 TTs with placebo and 3 TTs with SRV-CIPRO). Statistical significance was assessed using the Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. The Agar Disk Diffusion Assay Demonstrates the Extended Antibacterial Activity of SRV-CIPRO Using our TM model, the results demonstrated that SRV-CIPRO-coated TTs effectively inhibited P. aeruginosa Figure 3 Figure 3 3.2. Antibacterial Impact of the Coated Tube on Planktonic Bacterial Proliferation TTs coated with SRV-CIPRO showed a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa Figure 4 3.3. Biofilm Metabolic Assay The biofilm metabolic assay showed a significant reduction in bacterial metabolism up to day 6 in the medium exposed to SRV-CIPRO-coated tubes compared to SRV-placebo-coated tubes ( Figure 5 Figure 5 3.4. BacTiter-Glo TM To further assess the viability of the bacterial cells, we measured ATP levels, which serve as a reliable indicator of cell viability. ATP, the molecule responsible for storing and transferring energy within cells, is only produced by living cells, making it an effective marker for bacterial activity and survival. The results revealed a significantly lower number of viable bacteria in the bacterial culture exposed to SRV-CIPRO-coated tubes compared to those exposed to SRV-placebo-coated tubes. This reduction in bacterial viability persisted consistently and significantly throughout the first 7 days, indicating that the sustained release of ciprofloxacin from the coated tubes effectively controlled bacterial viability during this period ( Figure 6 3.5. High-Resolution-Scanning Electron Microscope (HR-SEM) HR-SEM images revealed a considerable inhibition of biofilm formation on the TTs coated with SRV-CIPRO for P. aeruginosa Figure 7 P. aeruginosa Figure 7 Figure 7 P. aeruginosa 3.6. Spinning Disk Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (SDCLSM) Spinning disk confocal laser scanning microscopy (SDCLSM) images revealed that SRV-CIPRO-coated tubes, following three days of exposure to planktonic P. aeruginosa Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 4. Discussion The objective of this study was to develop and assess a novel approach utilizing a local sustained-release technology, incorporated with ciprofloxacin, to prevent and manage early postoperative complications, particularly otorrhea due to infection, following TT insertion. TT insertion is widely used for the management of chronic OME and recurrent AOM [ 5 19 Our study demonstrated that the SRV-CIPRO-coated TTs might reduce the incidence of early postoperative otorrhea. This finding highlights the potential of sustained-release local antibiotic delivery technology as a superior alternative to conventional postoperative care methods. These include advantages such as reducing the repeated administration of topical ciprofloxacin, as in ear drops, which is an important patient compliance issue, especially in younger populations. The localized, continuous release of ciprofloxacin from the varnish ensures that therapeutic concentrations of the antibiotic are maintained at the site of potential infection for a prolonged period of time. This outcome aligns with previous studies that have underscored the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin in managing otorrhea when used as ear drops [ 13 14 Previous studies have demonstrated that TTs reduce the recurrence of AOM and improve hearing outcomes in the short to medium term [ 31 In this study, we have developed a simplistic initial model of insertion of a TT into an environment that may resemble the TM environment. The model consisted of two layers: a transparent plastic roll to replicate the TM’s outer flexibility and translucency zone, and a thin and more gelatinous layer of Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA). A small incision allowed for the insertion of the TT, simulating its positioning in the TM. This controlled in vitro model enabled us to assess the tube’s functionality and interaction with tissue-like layers. The effect of applying forces on the coated TT, the release of the agent in a gelatinous environment, and the duration of release can be assessed in this model. These conditions provide valuable insights into the behavior of TTs and the efficacy of SRV coatings in preventing infections, such as otorrhea. The model we used is a step further towards cell/bacteria models and in vivo clinical trials, as it provides better simulation of the conditions relevant to clinical outcomes, allowing for a more realistic assessment of TT performance in a setting similar to the human middle ear environment. The study by Roland et al. [ 19 Several coating procedures have been suggested in the ear–nose–throat clinical field. Coating of stents has been suggested in the literature as a therapeutic means to reduce biofilms on tympanostomy stents. TiO 2 P. aeruginosa 32 Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), silver oxide or silver, or combination coatings of tympanostomy tubes reduced P. aeruginosa 33 S. aureus 34 It is feasible that a technology of sustained release of the agents would probably enhance the efficacy of the suggested coatings and increase patient and caregiver compliance to the treatment. The pharmacological concept of a sustained-release delivery system is now being further explored for ear, nose, and throat applications, including a sinonasal stent and voice prosthesis coated with a SRV containing chlorhexidine [ 35 36 35 37 38 39 This is a feasibility study on developing an innovative means to affect microbial associated pathogenic conditions in otolaryngology using a sustained-release technology. Further studies on different bacterial strains, such as Staphylococcus aureus 5. Conclusions This study presents the development of a new approach for managing postoperative complications associated with TTs insertion by utilizing a local coating of SRV containing ciprofloxacin. The prolonged duration of the antibacterial/antibiofilm effects of the TT coated with SRV, which lasted for 10 days, offers a promising solution for reducing early postoperative complications, improving patient compliance, and minimizing the risks associated with systemic antibiotics. By addressing both clinical and practical challenges, this innovation has the potential to enhance patient outcomes and redefine postoperative care in otolaryngology.
