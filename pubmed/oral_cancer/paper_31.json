In vitro digested WMP (IVD‐WMP) could reduce the permeability of a gastrointestinal cell layer. In mouse studies, WMP was tested as a preventative and a treatment for dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis. WMP could improve recovery, reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted healthier gut bacteria. This suggests WMP could help support digestive wellness and recovery from gut inflammation. colitis inflammation microbiome mushroom oxidative stress Irish Research Council Enterprise Partnership Scheme (Postdoctoral) EPSPD/2022/130 Science Foundation Ireland Frontiers for the Future Programme 19/FFP/6499 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:02.10.2025  E.

The ancient Egyptians, Romans, and Mayans revered mushrooms as “immortality food,” “food of the Gods,” and “flesh of the Gods,” respectively [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 15 16 17 18 19 Despite representing one of the most widely consumed mushroom species worldwide, the health‐promoting effects of the white button mushroom ( Agaricus bisporus 20 A. bisporus 21 22 A. bisporus 22 A. bisporus 50 23 24 A. bisporus 25 26 A. bisporus 2 2 A. bisporus 27 A. bisporus 28 Agaricus 29 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by a dysregulated immune response, mucosal barrier disruption, and gut microbiota dysbiosis [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 This study further explores the potential of A. bisporus A. bisporus A. bisporus 2 Experimental Section 2.1 Mushroom Powder Mushroom powder used in this study was from A. bisporus 36 23 2.2 Dosage Information Dosage was determined as described previously [ 23 2.3 Cell Culture Caco‐2 or HT‐29‐MTX cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 4 2.4 In Vitro Permeability Assay Integrity of the cell monolayer was assayed by measuring permeability to FITC dextran as previously described [ 37 λ EX λ EM 2.5 In Vivo Studies C57BL/6 mice were maintained in ventilated cages at 21 ± 1°C, humidity 50% ± 10%, and with a 12 h‐light/12 h‐dark cycle under specific pathogen‐free conditions according to Irish and European Union regulations. Food and water were monitored and available ad libitum throughout experiments unless otherwise stated. All animal experiments were carried out according to the recommendations of Trinity College Dublin's Animal Research Ethics Committee and the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority, the competent authority responsible for the implementation of Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes in accordance with the requirements of the S.I No 543 of 2012. 2.6 DSS‐Induced Colitis The DSS‐induced colitis model is widely used as a robust model to study acute gastrointestinal inflammation similar to ulcerative colitis [ 38 39 1 2 TABLE 1 Scoring criteria for DAI.

The experimental timeline for the pretreatment trial is illustrated in Figure 2A 2A 2E 2E 2.8 Mucosa‐Blood Flux FITC‐Dextran Intestinal permeability in the pretreatment trial was assayed by translocation of FITC dextran 40 kDa (FD40; FD40S, Sigma–Aldrich). At 4 h before cull, mice received 80 mg/kg FD40 in 150 µL sterile PBS via oral gavage. Food was removed from the cage. Mice were culled by CO 2 g λ EX λ EM 2.9 Histology Sections from the distal colon of each mouse were obtained at the time of cull and subsequently fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin wax, sliced on a microtome at 5 µm thickness, and placed on polysine adhesive slides. Slides were baked at 55°C for 15 min. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to assess crypt length, tissue damage, and neutrophil infiltration. Alcian blue staining was performed to assess goblet cell loss. The staining steps were performed by a Leica Autostainer XL (Leica Microsystems). For H&E: xylene (x2), absolute alcohol (x2), tap water, hematoxylin (4 min), tap water, acid alcohol, tap water, eosin (2 min), tap water, absolute alcohol (x2), and xylene (x2). For Alcian blue: xylene (x2), absolute alcohol (x2), tap water, Alcian blue (pH 1; 5 min), tap water, nuclear fast red (5 min), tap water, absolute alcohol (x2), and xylene (x2). Tissue slices were imaged using an Olympus BX51 upright microscope. All slices were blind scored. For H&E sections, tissue damage and neutrophil infiltration were scored according to the scoring system as outlined in Table 2 40 TABLE 2 Scoring criteria for H&E.

For the pretreatment trial, fecal samples were taken on Day 0 (start WMP), on Day 9 of WMP administration (start DSS), and on Day 16 (cull). For the recovery trial, samples were taken on Day 0 (start DSS), on Day 4 (end DSS, start WMP), and on Day 9 (cull). DNA extraction was performed using a Power‐fecal‐pro DNA extraction kit (51804, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA samples were quantified using a Qubit Broad Range DNA kit (Thermo Fisher) and diluted to 5 ng/µL. 16S metagenomics libraries were prepared using a miniaturization protocol based on the 16S metagenomic library preparation guide (Illumina). In brief, an Echo 525 (Beckman Coulter) was used to combine 0.5 µL DNA, 2.5 µL Kapa Hifi HotStart Ready Mix, and 1 µL of each of the primers (at 1 µM) in individual wells of a 96‐well plate. The plate was spun briefly, and amplification was performed according to the 16S metagenomic library preparation guide (Illumina) with 30 cycles in place of 25. Following amplification, the volume of each sample was increased to 20 µL using molecular grade water, and the samples were cleaned using a 0.8 X ratio of Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter) on a Beckman i7 (Beckman Coulter). The index PCR was again set up using the Echo 525 to dispense the reagents as follows: 1 µL cleaned PCR product, 2 µL Unique Duel Indices (IDT), 5 µL Kapa Hifi HotStart Ready Mix, and 2 µL molecular grade water. Plates were spun briefly, and PCR was performed as described in the 16S metagenomic library preparation guide (Illumina). Samples were then quantified using a Qubit High Sensitivity kit (Thermo Fisher) and pooled at equal concentration. The final pool was further cleaned using a 0.7 X ratio of Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using the Qubit High Sensitivity kit (Thermo Fisher). It was then sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 using NextSeq1000/2000 P1 Reagents (600 cycles) according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Illumina). Sequencing data was processed using QIIME 2 (version 2024.5.0) (RRID:SCR_021258) [ 41 42 p 2.11 Cytokine Quantification Cytokine concentration was determined using Invitrogen Uncoated ELISA kits (Thermo‐Fisher) for mouse TNF (88‐7324), IL‐1𝛽 (88‐7013), IL‐6 (88‐7064), and IL‐10 (88‐7105) as per the manufacturer's protocol. 2.12 Oxidative Stress Assays Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in colon tissue was assessed using a slightly modified version of a previously described assay [ 43 2.13 RT‐qPCR RNA was isolated using the PureLink RNA mini kit (12183018A, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol, quantified using a Nanodrop 2000 UV‐visible spectrophotometer, and DNase‐treated according to manufacturer's protocol (EN0521, Thermo Scientific). Total RNA was reverse transcribed with a high‐capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (4368814, Applied Biosystems), and cDNA was amplified using SYBR green‐based real‐time PCR (A25742, Applied Biosystems). SYBR RT‐qPCR results were analyzed by the CT method [2‐(ΔΔCT)] to compare genes of interest to endogenous control genes. Primer sequences are listed in Table 3 TABLE 3 Primer sequences for RT‐qPCR.

Pretreatment of Caco‐2 cell monolayers with IVD‐WMP significantly reduced the translocation of FITC‐dextran into the basal compartment of the transwell system (Figure 1A 1B S1A, D FIGURE 1  A. bisporus A. bisporus n p p t 3.2  A. bisporus Gastrointestinal inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction were modeled in mice by the administration of DSS via drinking water.

Distal colon tissue from pretreatment (A–F) and recovery (G–M) trials were fixed in formalin (10%), and 5 µm slices were histological analysis performed by the H&E method and the Alcian blue method. Representative images for both are shown (C, J; 100X magnification; scale bar = 200 µm). H&E images were scored for tissue damage and neutrophil infiltration to give a combined histology score (A, G). Alcian blue images were assessed for positive goblet cell stain (B, H). Additionally, in the recovery trial crypt length could be measured (I).

Proximal and distal colon tissue from pretreatment (A–F) and recovery (G–L) trials were analyzed for levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO; A, D, G, J), malondialdehyde (MDA; B, E, H, K), and superoxide dismutase (SOD; C, F, I, L).

Relative abundance of the Top 10 genera at Day 9 are displayed as stacked bar chart (C). Differences between the WMP pretreatment compared to vehicle control at Day 9 were revealed in abundance levels of A lphaproteobacteria Allobaculum Parabacteroides n p 3.11  A. bisporus To determine any effect of WMP treatment on the gut microbiota during the recovery period following DSS colitis, we conducted 16S rRNA sequencing on fecal samples from the recovery trial (Figure 6G–I 6G 6H 6I 4 Discussion IBD is a chronic inflammatory condition of the digestive tract. Clinically, IBD is characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fatigue. A key pathophysiological feature of IBD is increased intestinal permeability, often referred to as a “leaky gut,” wherein the integrity of tight junctions within the intestinal epithelium is compromised, permitting the translocation of bacteria and antigens across the intestinal barrier and into the bloodstream, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease [ 44 Recent research has highlighted the potential therapeutic benefits of polysaccharide extracts and products derived from various mushroom species in experimental models of IBD [ 19 45 47 A. bisporus 28 A. bisporus A. bisporus A. bisporus 23 We previously established an in vitro digestion procedure for WMP and confirmed that, following simulated digestion, IVD‐WMP retains its antiinflammatory properties in HEK dectin1 and HEK Toll‐like‐receptor‐4 cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of IVD‐WMP is antiinflammatory in a mouse model of zymosan‐induced peritonitis [ 23 24 2 25 48 The current investigation employed a DSS‐induced colitis model in mice to evaluate the effects of A. bisporus WMP in both a preventative pretreatment context and a therapeutic recovery context. Due to ethical concerns, best practice guidelines, and project license limitations on repeated oral gavage in mice, it was not possible to administer WMP before, during, and following colitis in the same cohort of mice. However, we would hypothesize that this dosing schedule could contribute to further amelioration of the beneficial effects described, as WMP pretreatment seems to moderately decrease the severity of inflammation and, following inflammation, to speed repair of the tissue. Oral gavage was chosen as the most efficient way of ensuring that dosing of WMP was consistent for each mouse during the trial, particularly during and after the DSS period when food intake tends to be lower. However, this procedure can be stressful; therefore, long‐term effects of dietary WMP, both generally and pre‐, during, and postinflammation could be studied in the future by incorporation into standard mouse chow. Although the effects were not significant, pretreatment with WMP consistently scored lower in stool and blood indices during the acute DSS colitis period and provided significant protection against colon shortening at the day of sacrifice. Histologically, no benefits of WMP pretreatment were observed in distal colon tissue in terms of tissue damage or cell infiltration; however, protection against goblet cell loss was observed. Additionally, there was a nonsignificant trend for intestinal permeability, as measured by FITC‐dextran, to be protected by WMP pretreatment. When administered during the recovery phase following DSS‐induced colitis, WMP significantly lowered stool and DAI scores, and protected against colon shortening. Tissue histology showed improved crypt length measurements and a subtle, nonsignificant improvement in tissue damage and neutrophil infiltration scores in the WMP group, which may be suggestive of a boost to tissue repair. Intestinal epithelial barrier integrity is maintained via tight junction complexes, which are crucial for regulating transport across the epithelium. Disruption of tight junction proteins by dysregulated protein expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD [ 49 50 Inflammatory mediators and ROS play a critical role in the disruption of tight junction proteins and the subsequent increase in gut permeability that contributes to the progression of ulcerative colitis [ 51 52 53 E. coli 54 We previously reported a decrease in IL‐10 in the proximal colon in DSS with some protection against this decrease for WMP [ 23 46 47 As expected, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, indicated by increased levels of MPO and MDA, were elevated following DSS‐induced colitis compared to controls. WMP pretreatment could significantly mitigate MPO increases and similarly showed a trend suggesting protective effects on MDA levels, in the distal colon compared to DSS. SOD, an antioxidant enzyme that is active in response to ROS, was increased in the distal colon of both groups likely in response to DSS‐induced ROS production. In the recovery trial, MPO levels in the proximal colon approached those of healthy controls for the WMP group, while the DSS group was still significantly elevated. In the distal colon, we see a similar, though nonsignificant, trend again indicating a faster recovery. No significant differences in MDA or SOD activity were observed across any groups in recovery. These findings suggest that WMP may support intestinal barrier integrity in DSS‐induced colitis by modulating inflammation and oxidative stress. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated significant DPPH scavenging ability of methanolic [ 55 56 A. bisporus A. bisporus 56 57 58 To evaluate the potential modulatory effects of WMP on gut microbiota, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing on fecal samples collected from mice across both experimental trials. In the pretreatment trial, we observed a lower Shannon index, indicative of reduced alpha diversity, in the WMP group compared to the DSS group on Day 9. Given that this finding was also observed on Day 0 (data not shown), we believe it to be a cage effect, unrelated to WMP treatment or DSS, as mice were housed according to treatment group. Beta diversity metrics indicated a significant overall difference in microbiome composition across groups at Days 9 and 16. A more detailed taxonomic analysis at the genus level revealed differences in the WMP pretreated group compared to vehicle control, indicating that WMP may selectively influence specific bacterial taxa. These changes were noted at Day 9 only, before DSS administration. There was a significant reduction in the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria Allobaculum Parabacteroides Alphaproteobacteria 59 Allobaculum Erysipelotrichaceae Allobaculum 60 61 Allobaculum A. mucolyticum 62 A. mucolyticum 63 Allobaculum Parabacteroides 64 65 66 38 67 5 Conclusion In conclusion, this study demonstrates that WMP from A. bisporus A. bisporus A. bisporus A. bisporus Conflicts of Interest Supriya Yadav and Jude Wilson are employees of MBio, part of Monaghan Mushrooms Group who supplied the powdered mushroom used in this study.
