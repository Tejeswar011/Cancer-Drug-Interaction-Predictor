However, oral antifungals present contraindications and potential drug–drug interactions, while topical antifungals suffer from limited efficacy and penetration. Recently, researchers have explored physical therapies, including laser and photodynamic therapy. Objective To evaluate the clinical efficacy of combining diode laser therapy with photodynamic therapy and ciclopirox 8% hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH) nail lacquer in treating onychomycosis. Methods We conducted a randomised controlled clinical trial involving patients with onychomycosis. A total of 26 patients were enrolled and followed for 12 months. Participants received either eight sessions of laser treatment combined with three sessions of photodynamic therapy, or daily treatment with ciclopirox 8% HPCH. Results The clinical cure rate was 94.1% in the group treated with laser and photodynamic therapy, compared to 53.3% in the group treated with ciclopirox 8% HPCH ( p p Conclusions Treatment of onychomycosis using diode laser and photodynamic therapy results in higher clinical cure rates and shorter healing times compared to the reference treatment with 8% ciclopirox HPCH.

It results in symptoms such as chromonychia, onycholysis, thickening and ridging of the nail plate, and subungual hyperkeratosis [ 1 2 3 2 3 2 The primary micro‐organisms implicated in onychomycosis include dermatophytes (e.g., Trichophyton spp.), non‐dermatophyte moulds (e.g., Aspergillus spp.), and yeasts (notably, Candida spp.) [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 Oral antifungal treatments are the gold standard for managing onychomycosis, particularly in severe cases, with cure rates ranging from 40% to 80%. However, these treatments can produce mild to moderate side effects, such as skin rashes, gastrointestinal disorders, and headaches, as well as serious effects, including kidney or liver damage, heart failure, and drug–drug interactions [ 10 11 12 13 6 12 14 15 12 14 15 10 10 10 The systemic toxicity associated with oral antifungals, along with the limitations of topical antifungals, has prompted research into alternative physical therapies [ 12 13 12 13 15 16 17 18 A systematic review published in 2025 reports that photodynamic therapy (PDT) significantly reduced the severity of onychomycosis, with a reduction in the OSI ranging from 30% to 90% and a median reduction of 70% [ 16 16 12 12 Laser and PDT have several advantages over oral and topical antifungal drugs, including shorter treatment durations, improved adherence, and the absence of systemic side effects and mild local effects [ 13 16 19 13 15 16 19 13 16 19 The primary objective of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of using a diode laser in combination with photodynamic therapy and ciclopirox 8% HPCH nail lacquer for treating onychomycosis. 2 Research Design and Methods 2.1 Study Design We conducted a randomised, controlled parallel (1:1) clinical trial involving patients with onychomycosis. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov 2.2 Study Population Participants qualified for the study if they were at least 18 years old and had a confirmed case of onychomycosis in at least one toenail, verified through microbiological culture and PCR testing. An experienced investigator collected nail samples with clinical signs of onychomycosis (chromonychia, onycholysis, thickening, and ridging of the nail plate, and subungual hyperkeratosis) by cutting the nails, taking scrapings or subungual hyperkeratosis, or detritus, and milling the nail plate [ 1 20 20 For patients with two or more affected nails, each nail's treatment was recorded independently. Participants treated with oral or topical antifungals within the last month were excluded from the study. Additionally, several conditions led to exclusion, including pregnancy or breastfeeding, peripheral vascular disease, immune disorders, treatment with immunosuppressants, central or peripheral neuropathy, coagulation disorders, Raynaud's syndrome, and any alterations in the perception of cold or heat. 2.3 Recruitment and Randomization of Participants Recruitment and follow‐up of all participants occurred from September 2023 to January 2025. The study received approval from a local ethics committee (Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain) in February 2023 (protocol number 23/061‐EC_M) and from the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (No. EudraCT 2022‐003913‐12). Each patient provided written informed consent before inclusion in the study. All patients in the study were monitored over a 12‐month period and assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, irrespective of their healing timeline. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either diode laser and photodynamic therapy or ciclopirox 8% HPCH treatment. The randomization was conducted using Epidat version 4.1 (Consellería de Sanidade, Xunta de Galicia, Spain). 2.4 Intervention The same podiatrist, who also served as the researcher, performed all interventions during the study. In the study, all patients received the same hygiene recommendations, irrespective of their treatment group. These recommendations included washing the foot daily with acid pH soap (5.5), thoroughly drying the feet, disinfecting footwear daily, discarding old and contaminated footwear, not sharing footwear, minimising nail microtrauma by ensuring a proper footwear fit, and avoiding walking barefoot in public showers and swimming pools. Group 1, which received laser and photodynamic therapy, had visits scheduled every 7 days at baseline and continued for 9 weeks. In contrast, Group 2, which was treated with ciclopirox 8% HPCH nail lacquer, had monthly visits throughout the 12‐month follow‐up. During each visit or check‐up, debridement was performed. This procedure involved cutting and milling the detached nail plate and using a number 15 scalpel to delaminate the peri‐ and subungual hyperkeratotic tissue. These steps were undertaken to enhance the treatment effects [ 21 2.4.1 Diode Laser and Photodynamic Therapy The diode laser, operating at various wavelengths (810–1064 nm), was used in conjunction with photodynamic therapy (PDT) employing a red laser (635 nm). Both procedures utilized the Rapido Podia Diode Laser (Medency Srl, Vicenza, Italy). The DIRECTO collimated handpiece (Medency Srl, Vicenza, Italy), featuring a 1 cm 2 Eight treatment sessions were conducted according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the protocol outlined in a recent case series [ 15 In sessions 1, 4, and 8, we implemented the PDT‐ONYCHOMYCOSIS protocol, which combines diode laser and photodynamic therapy using variable wavelengths and durations. This protocol includes the following steps: (1) mechanical debridement of the nail, (2) disinfection with alcohol, (3) application of an 810 ± 10 nm diode laser, within 1–5 W power and a frequency range from continuous wave (CW) to 10 Hz, for 3 min to prevent thermal shock, (4) application of a topical photosensitizer, toluidine blue gel, with the nail covered for 5 min to prevent activation by natural light, (5) activation of the topical photosensitizer using a 635 ± 10 nm diode laser at 0.2 W‐CW for 10 min, (6) cleaning of the area, and (7) application of a 1064 ± 10 nm diode laser with 6–8 W power and a frequency range from CW to 10 Hz for 3 min. The remaining five sessions involved the application of diode laser treatments using different wavelengths, following the LASER‐ONICOMICOSIS protocol. The procedure included: (1) the mechanical debridement of the nail; (2) disinfection of the nail with alcohol; (3) application of an 810 ± 10 nm diode laser with a power range of 1 W to 5 W and a frequency range from CW to 10 Hz for 3 min; (4) a 3‐min pause; and (5) application of a 1064 ± 10 nm diode laser with a power range of 6 to 8 W and a frequency range from CW to 10 Hz for 3 min. 2.4.2 Ciclopirox 8% HPCH During the initial study visit, the patient received Ony‐tec (Almirall S.A., Barcelona, Spain) for daily self‐administration at home. Ony‐tec is an antifungal nail lacquer that contains ciclopirox 80 mg/g alongside ethyl acetate, ethanol (96%), ketostearyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl chitosan, and purified water [ 22 Ony‐Tec nail varnish is recommended for application in the evening, before going to bed. According to the manufacturer, the varnish requires about 30 s to dry and should not be washed off for at least 6 h [ 22 22 2.5 Outcome Measurements 2.5.1 Primary Outcome The primary outcome was the clinical cure of the affected nail following eight treatment sessions in Group 1 (diode laser and photodynamic therapy) and after at least 9 months of treatment in Group 2 (ciclopirox 8% HPCH nail lacquer). Clinical cure is defined as the absence of the most common signs and symptoms of onychomycosis, namely subungual detritus, dermatophytoma, changes in nail plate colour, and onycholysis. The persistence of clinical signs of onychomycosis after eight treatment sessions in Group 1 or after 12 months of treatment in Group 2 was classified as not cured. In addition, microbiological cultures were performed on all clinically cured nails to determine the clinical and complete cure rates. A mycological cure was defined by a negative microbiological culture result. PCR was not used to assess mycological cure because it is a highly sensitive test that can detect DNA from non‐viable fungal cells, potentially leading to false‐positive results after treatment [ 23 2.5.2 Secondary Outcomes Secondary outcomes included: (a) identifying associations between onychomycosis cure and various factors such as age, sex, history of onychomycosis, number and location of affected nails, type and severity of onychomycosis (OSI) before treatment, causal fungal organism, duration of the condition, prior treatments, type of previous treatment, and the assigned treatment; (b) time to clinical cure; (c) improvement in OSI; and (d) occurrence of recurrences after cure and during the 12‐month follow‐up. The severity of onychomycosis using OSI was analyzed by a blinded external evaluator using photographs of the nail taken before treatment and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of treatment. 2.6 Statistical Analysis All analyses were conducted on an intention‐to‐treat basis, incorporating all patients in their assigned randomised groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.22 (IBM Corp.). Frequency and descriptive analyses were included in the study. The Shapiro–Wilk test was conducted to determine if the variables followed a normal distribution ( p p p The primary analysis compared the clinical cure rate of onychomycosis between the two randomised groups using a chi‐square ( χ 2 χ 2 U p The sample size was determined to be 13 patients per treatment group. This calculation was based on achieving a statistical power of 0.80 and a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, utilising the GRANMO Sample Size Calculator version 7.12 Online (Institut Municipal d'Investigació Mèdica, Barcelona, Spain). 3 Results Forty‐two patients were selected as potential participants, and 26 (61.9%) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: 13 patients were placed in the laser and photodynamic therapy group, and 13 patients were assigned to the ciclopirox HPCH nail lacquer group. Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Study flow diagram. Thirteen patients, accounting for 18 nails (51.4%), received treatment with laser and photodynamic therapy, while another 13 patients, with 17 nails (48.6%), were treated with ciclopirox 8% HPCH nail lacquer. By the end of the study, 24 participants had completed treatment across 32 nails. Specifically, 12 patients with 17 nails finished treatment involving laser and photodynamic therapy, and another 12 patients with 15 nails concluded treatment with ciclopirox 8% HPCH.

Significant differences were found between the two treatments, with a difference of 40.8% ( p 5 To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared laser treatment directly with the topical application of ciclopirox 8%, the reference product in Europe. However, clinical trials and meta‐analyses have compared the efficacy of onychomycosis treatments involving different types of lasers and medical interventions, such as oral antifungals and other topical agents like amorolfine. The systematic review and meta‐analysis by Meretsky et al. [ 13 I 2 13 Another meta‐analysis on laser therapy conducted by Yeung et al. [ 18 I 2 I 2 I 2 18 18 In all trials included in the Yeung et al. [ 18 2 18 In 2025, Navarro Pérez et al. [ 17 17 17 17 A systematic review of the efficacy of photodynamic therapy for onychomycosis reported clinical cure rates ranging from 20% to 80% and improvements in OSI values from 30% to 90% [ 16 2 16 16 16 16 The authors of this article argue that significant heterogeneity exists among studies previously described in the literature. This variability is evident in aspects such as laser types, laser parameters (including power and wavelength), control groups, and the variables analysed. In a review by Gupta et al. [ 24 2 2 24 24 24 Cure rates for the group treated with ciclopirox 8% HPCH nail polish were lower; however, the clinical cure rates achieved (53.3%) exceeded those reported in prior studies at 12 months of treatment. This improvement might be attributed to the combined regimen of monthly clinical debridement and recommended hygiene measures for all patients. Zalacaín et al. [ 10 10 25 25 14 Logistic regression analysis indicated significant differences between treatment groups, with an odds ratio of 0.071 (95% confidence interval: 0.007–0.685, p p The mean number of months to healing was significantly lower in the group receiving laser treatment and photodynamic therapy (3.6 ± 1.2 months) compared to the group treated with ciclopirox 8% HPCH nail lacquer (9.2 ± 1.6 months) ( p p 10 13 14 25 26 27 During the treatment, no adverse effects were observed in the group treated with ciclopirox 8% HPCH. However, two patients in the group subjected to laser and photodynamic therapy experienced mild adverse effects, specifically subungual hematoma and blister formation. These effects were not linked to treatment outcomes or subsequent relapses ( p 14 14 13 Recurrence occurred in four out of 12 patients (33.3%) who completed treatment with laser and photodynamic therapy. In contrast, although the group treated with ciclopirox 8% had a lower clinical cure rate, no recurrences were observed. The authors suggest this could be attributed to the shorter follow‐up period after treatment completion in the ciclopirox 8% group, where the treatment lasted a minimum of 9 months. In a clinical trial examining the effects of varying session numbers using a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser at 240–348 J/cm 2 27 Other findings from the statistical analysis were the higher prevalence of dermatophytoma in the group of patients treated with laser and PDT, which did not appear to influence the healing results. Previous studies have identified dermatophytomas as a sign of severe infection, showing low antifungal healing rates and being excluded from most clinical trials [ 21 This study had several limitations. First, the follow‐up of all patients and the treatment for the group receiving laser and photodynamic therapy were conducted exclusively by the same podiatrist researcher at a single podiatry center specializing in onychomycosis. Thus, treatment results might vary if applied in other medical centers by different professionals. Furthermore, there was no blinding of the investigators or the patients, which could potentially introduce bias in the results of the different treatments. Second, the study did not include a third group that combined the reference treatment with the new laser plus photodynamic therapy protocol. As a result, it remains unclear whether combining these treatments could further enhance clinical, mycological, and aesthetic outcomes. Third, microbiological cultures were not conducted for patients who did not achieve clinical cure, which may introduce bias in the mycological cure rate. Finally, the post‐treatment follow‐up period was longer in the group treated with laser and photodynamic therapy because treatment in the 8% ciclopirox HPCH group was 9 months. Despite its limitations, this study represents the first randomised controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of onychomycosis treatment using a combination of diode laser and photodynamic therapy with the standard treatment of 8% ciclopirox hydrolacquer. Notable strengths of the study include a 12‐month follow‐up period for all patients and the detailed description of a clinical protocol for the application of laser and/or photodynamic therapy in treating onychomycosis. In conclusion, treating onychomycosis with a diode laser combined with photodynamic therapy over an 8‐session protocol is effective, resulting in significantly higher clinical cure rates than the reference treatment using 8% ciclopirox HPCH. Furthermore, the healing times with diode laser and photodynamic therapy are considerably shorter compared to the daily topical application of 8% ciclopirox HPCH. However, all recurrences occurred in the group treated with laser and PDT, so further research is considered necessary. Future studies could explore the combination of laser and/or photodynamic therapy with topical antifungal treatment using 8% ciclopirox hydrolacquer. This research could analyze mycological cure rates across all cases and compare varying numbers of treatment sessions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct multicenter studies with longer follow‐up periods and larger sample sizes.
