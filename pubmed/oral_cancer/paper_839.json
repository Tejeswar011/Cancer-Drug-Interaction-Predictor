Introduction In recent years, the incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) has become increasingly severe on a global scale, with its morbidity showing a continuous upward trend. UC is a rather complex, chronic, and unspecified intestinal inflammatory disorder, and its pathogenesis involves multiple pathogenic factors, such as the disorder of the intestinal mucosal immune system, the imbalance of the functions of immune cells, and genetic susceptibility [ 1 2 3 Clostridioides difficile Shigella, Escherichia coli 4 Akkermansia Bifidobacteriaceae 5 Roseburia 6 In addition, as a chronic inflammatory disease, the onset and progression of UC are intricately linked to numerous inflammation-associated factors, with intestinal barrier impairment being a particularly significant one. It has been reported that the intestinal physical barrier serves as the primary and crucial line of defense against diverse potential pathogens. Being a one-of-a-kind selective barrier system peculiar to the intestine, it has extremely important functions. It can effectively prevent exogenous antigens from causing damage to the body and, thus, represents an irreplaceable and vital part of sustaining the homeostasis of the internal environment of the intestine [ 7 8 Currently, traditional immunosuppressive drugs are frequently utilized in the clinical management of UC. While these medications demonstrate significant short-term therapeutic outcomes, long-term use can lead to obvious systemic side effects that are prone to recurrence after discontinuation [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials and Reagents The APS used in the study was supplied by Shanghai Winherb Medical Science Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and had a purity of 95.7%. DSS, with a molecular weight ranging from 36 to 50 kilodaltons, was supplied from MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA, USA). 5-Aminosalicylic Acid (5-ASA), with a purity exceeding 98%, was bought from ACMEC Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Alcian blue (AB) staining, 4% paraformaldehyde, and the primary antibodies, including MUC2 and MUC5AC, were procured from Wuhan Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for mice IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-22, ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 were provided by Shanghai Enzyme Linked Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). TUNEL Apoptosis Detection Kit I, POD (MK1025) was purchased from Wuhan Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix and HiScript ® 2.2. Experimental Design Altogether, 60 male SPF-grade C57BL/6J mice aged four weeks were procured from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Liaoning, China). All the experimental mice were raised in the animal laboratory of Henan Agricultural University and were provided with sufficient food and water without any restrictions. At the same time, the standard laboratory environmental conditions, including humidity (50% ± 5%) and temperature (22 ± 2 °C), were also carefully maintained. Following a week of acclimatization and feeding to minimize stress-related physiological variations, all mice, which were individually housed in individually ventilated cages, were assigned at random to 6 separate groups equally ( n 18 Figure 1 17 19 g 2 3 2.3. Disease Activity Index (DAI) Evaluation During the induction of colitis, the changes in the body weight of the mice were documented every day. Additionally, the rate of body weight loss, the presence of bloody stools, and stool morphology were observed and counted. These parameters were used to evaluate the DAI, which reflects the seriousness of colitis in the mice. Specifically, DAI = (weight loss rate + bloody stool + stool morphology)/3 [ 17 2.4. Histological Examination The colonic tissues were immobilized in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for a minimum of 24 h. Afterwards, paraffin infiltration and embedding were performed after dehydration with different gradients of alcohol. Subsequently, 4 μm paraffin cuts of colon were prepared for H&E staining, followed by observation of colon tissue damage using an optical microscope for tissue pathology scoring, as previously described [ 18 2.5. Alcian Blue Staining According to the manufacturer’s instructions, 4 μm paraffin slices of colon tissue were stained with Alcian blue, and mucin-producing goblet cells were noticed and evaluated via an optical microscope. 2.6. Apoptosis Detection Test Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT)-mediated d-UTP terminal labeling staining was employed to detect the apoptosis level in colon tissue. Briefly, the prepared colon tissue slices were treated with 3% H 2 2 2.7. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analysis The collected 1 mm 3 , 2.8. Immuno-Histochemical Assay As previously described, immuno-histochemical staining was used to examine mucin expression (MUC2 and MUC5AC) in colon tissue. Briefly, paraffin slices of the colon were dewaxed to water using xylene, followed by antigen repair using pH 8.0 EDTA buffer. After 3 PBS (pH 7.4) washes, the sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide liquid and placed in incubation at ambient temperature in the absence of light for 25 min to block endogenous peroxidase. Thereafter, 3% bovine serum albumin was added under ambient temperature and incubated for 30 min to achieve blocking. Next, the slices were treated by adding the primary antibody mixed with a certain proportion of PBS. The slices were then incubated flat in a wet box at 4 °C throughout the night. After the slices had been washed 3 times with PBS, the corresponding secondary antibody was added and remained under treatment for 50 min. Finally, the colonic tissue specimens were subjected to DAB staining, re-stained with hematoxylin, and observed under an optical microscope. 2.9. RNA Extraction and q-PCR The mRNA levels of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL10, TLR-4, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 in colon tissues were detected by Real-time PCR. Colon tissues underwent RNA extraction via the Trizol method. The NanoDrop 2000 nucleic acid protein analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) was used to evaluate RNA content and concentration. GAPDH can be utilized as an internal reference gene. The primers (primer sequences in Table S1 −ΔΔCT 2.10. Western Blot Assay The colonic tissue was made homogeneous and then cleaved by a RIPA working fluid. After a 30 min ice bath, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the collected supernatant was the total protein solution. Colon tissue-derived proteins were separated and transferred onto PVDF membranes by means of 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE. The transformed PVDF membrane was placed in an appropriate amount of 5% skim milk powder for shaking and sealing for 1 h. Then, the primary antibody was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was then treated with the secondary antibody for 1 h. The freshly prepared ECL mixture was dripped onto the protein side of the membrane for color development to detect protein bands after TBST washing. The optical density value of the target strip was analyzed using an ImageJ software (v1.53q) processing system, and the result was normalized to GAPDH. 2.11. Biochemical Indices in Serum and Colon Analysis The cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-22 were measured in serum, while the tight junction proteins ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1 were measured in colon tissue using ELISA kits, as recommended by the manufacturer. 2.12. DNA Extraction and Metagenome Sequencing According to the requirements of metagenomic sequencing, 4 mice from each group were randomly selected for DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing. As recommended by the manufacturer, the E.Z.N.A. ® 2.13. Microbiome Analysis Utilizing the original sequencing data, fastp (v0.20.0) was employed for data quality control, trimming off low-quality reads (length < 50 bp, average base quality < 20), as well as reads containing N bases, so as to obtain the high-quality sequences needed for subsequent analysis. BWA software (v 0.7.9a) was employed to map reads to host DNA sequences and remove highly/similar contaminated reads. The optimized sequences were assembled using MEGAHIT v1.1.2 [ 19 https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal −5 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/hmmer/search/hmmscan To show the diversity and plenty of microbial communities, the Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices were determined with Mothur v1.30.2 [ 20 2.14. Statistical Analysis Before all the tests were conducted, the experimental personnel involved were unaware of the grouping of the mice. All the data from the experimental animals showed no abnormalities, and the data generated were all used for statistical analysis. Graph Pad Prism 7 and SPSS 21 were utilized for the data analysis. The data is shown as means ± Standard error of mean (SEM). To evaluate group differences, the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized. It is considered that p p 3. Results In this study, a mouse colitis model was induced using 4% DSS. The aim was to investigate the dose-dependent effect of APS in alleviating colitis in mice, and 5-ASA was used as the positive control drug. 3.1. APS Mitigated the Symptoms of Colitis The underlying pathological symptoms in UC mice included colon shortening, weight loss, elevated DAI scores, and significant pathological alterations. In this study, the model mice experienced diarrhea, blood in the stool, weight loss, and a marked rise in DAI while receiving DSS therapy. However, in a dose-dependent way, APS alleviated the aforementioned symptoms ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. APS Maintains Gut Integrity It is commonly believed that UC is caused by damage to the intestinal mucosa. Its pathogenesis is linked to the weakening of gut epithelial barrier function and increased gut permeability [ 7 18 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 3.3. APS Restores the Tight Junctions and Enhances Protein Production Tight junction proteins maintain the intestinal mucosal barrier’s integrity [ 21 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 3.4. APS Restores MUC2 and MUC5AC Secretions Mucins like MUC2 and MUC5AC, which are essential for the operation of the mucus barrier, maintain the layer of mucus in the colon. The expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC was markedly down-regulated in the colon tissues of UC patients. This is associated with the severity and activity of UC [ 22 Figure 4 3.5. Protective Effect of APS-H Against Inflammation Through TLR4, MyD88, and the NF-κB Pathway TLRs are thought of as bridges that change how the host immune system and gut bacteria interact. TLR4 levels have been found to be greater in UC patients [ 23 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 3.6. Alfalfa Polysaccharide Improves Intestinal Flora Imbalance In order to investigate whether APS can change the composition of gut flora, we performed metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples from mice in the CON, DSS, 5-ASA, and APS-H groups. We mainly studied the disparities in the overall composition and specific differences of the intestinal microbial communities among the four groups, especially at the species level. Firstly, as illustrated in Figure 6 Figure 6 To further explore the changes in microbial composition, we compared the relative abundance of dominant phyla, prevailing genera, and major species in each group, especially the change in taxa abundance caused by APS.

Discussion The primary symptoms of UC are abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, indigestion, and rectal bleeding [ 20 11 Similar to other plant-derived polysaccharides [ 21 22 12 19 23 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by the impairment of the gut barrier and the dysregulation of gut homeostasis. In mice with UC, the intestinal structure exhibited phenomena such as ruptured crypts, scant villi, enlarged cell spacing, damaged mucosa, a deficiency of goblet cells, and an excessive infiltration of neutrophils [ 24 25 26 27 28 Tight junction protein expression levels are closely related to intestinal integrity and permeability. Research has found that the abnormal expression of tight junction proteins in the intestine of mice with colitis will exacerbate the occurrence and development of colitis [ 28 29 The mucus layer, made up of a lot of mucin and antimicrobial peptides, is the intestinal mucosa’s biochemical barrier [ 30 31 31 TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB pathway activation is intimately linked to the DSS-induced IBD model. The activation of this pathway promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cyto-kines. Inflammatory bowel disease can be effectively treated or alleviated by down-regulating this pathway using a variety of techniques [ 32 14 33 14 In recent years, it has been confirmed that intestinal flora imbalance and UC are related [ 34 34 35 Eubacterium Lactobacillus Ruminococcus Bifidobacterium lachnospiraceae Balutia species 36 37 Helicobacter Bacteroides Clostridium Oscillibacter 38 unclassified_f lachnospiraceae Parabacteroides Alistipes Mucispirillum Bacteroides Prevotella Clostridium Oscillibacter Pseudoflavonifractor Escherichia Proteobacteria Parabacteroides 39 s__Lachnospiraceae_bacterium s__Roseburia_sp__CAG_10041_57 s__Eubacterium_plexicaudatum s__Roseburia 1XD42 69, s_Acetatifactor_muris s__Bacteroides_intestinalis s__Bacteroides_thetaiotaomicron s__Faecalibaculum_rodentium s__Streptococcus_alactolyticus 40 s__Parabacteroides_distasonis 41 42 Although the exact origin of IBD is currently unresolved, the general consensus is that a modified functional mechanism and immune system dysregulation brought on by dysbiosis are most likely to blame [ 43 Parabacteroides distasonis 44 45 46 Bacteroides Oscillibacter Porphyromonas 46 47 48 Parabacteroides distasonis 49 Mucispirillum_schaedleri Parabacteroides distasonis Escherichia_coli Oscillibacter_sp._1 3 Bacteroides acidifaciens, Pseudoflavonifractor sp 60 50 Despite these promising findings, this study has several key limitations. First, the chemical structure of the APS used in this study remains unknown. Additionally, the study lacks integrated metabolomics and direct mechanistic validation. Therefore, in subsequent studies, we will chemically characterize the structure of APS to establish its structure–activity relationship, verify the roles of the key bacteria participating in the anti-colitis impact of APS, and clarify the molecular mechanisms by which APS displays its efficacy. At the same time, it is necessary to combine metabolomics to elucidate the “microbiota-metabolite-host” cascade regulatory network. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, APS can alleviate the manifestations of colitis in mice through multiple targets. It mainly improves the manifestations of mouse colitis by relieving the reduction in body weight and reducing the injury to the colon tissue. Moreover, it exerts anti-inflammatory effects by up-regulating the levels of tight junction proteins, increasing the number of goblet cells and mucin production, reducing the number of apoptotic cells, and inhibiting the MyD88/TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway mediated by gut microbiota, thereby decreasing the injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier function brought on by DSS-induced colitis. In addition, APS-H can also avoid the imbalance of the gut microbiota in mice with DSS-induced colitis, restore the relative abundances of important bacteria ( Parabacteroides distasonis Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nu17183001/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, B.L. and Y.S.; data curation, S.L. and Y.C.; formal analysis, B.L.; methodology, S.L. and H.L.; software, H.L. and Y.C.; validation, S.L. and H.L.; investigation, S.L. and H.L.; resources, Y.S.; writing—original draft preparation, S.L. and M.A.; writing—review and editing, Y.S.; visualization, H.L.; supervision, Y.S. and B.L.; project administration, Y.S.; funding acquisition, Y.S.
