Obesity has emerged as one of the most pressing global public health challenges of the 21st century. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, with over 1 billion people classified as obese in 2022, representing 13 % of the global population. Since 1975, obesity rates have tripled, and projections indicate that by 2035, around 1.9 billion adults—approximately 25 % of the world's population—will be affected. Looking further ahead to 2050, it is estimated that 3.80 billion adults, representing more than half of the anticipated global adult population, will be living with overweight or obesity. The increasing burden of obesity is associated with an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and multiple cancers, collectively contributing to over 5 million deaths annually. Obesity is driven by complex interactions between genetic, behavioral, environmental, and socioeconomic factors, with rapid urbanization and globalization accelerating the consumption of high-calorie diets and sedentary lifestyles. While historically prevalent in high-income nations, obesity rates are now rising most rapidly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with over 70 % of obese individuals living in developing nations. The economic costs of obesity are staggering, with projections estimating a global financial burden of $4.32 trillion per year by 2035, equivalent to 3 % of the global GDP. This article explores the epidemiology, determinants, health implications, and policy responses to obesity, emphasizing the urgent need for multisectoral strategies to mitigate its impact. Public health initiatives, taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages, improved food regulations, and increased physical activity promotion are essential components of evidence-based interventions. Addressing the obesity crisis requires global cooperation to implement sustainable, long-term strategies targeting both prevention and treatment.

In 2022, more than 1 billion people worldwide were living with obesity (body mass index ≥30) – roughly one in eight adults – and about 43 % of adults were classified as overweight or obese [ 1 1 2 Notably, the obesity epidemic is a truly worldwide phenomenon, transcending socioeconomic and geographic boundaries [ [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 1 [11] [12] [13] 1 [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] 5 The causes of this global rise in obesity are multifactorial and complex. Fundamentally, obesity develops from a chronic imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure [ [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] 51 52 53 54 55 In addition to biological and lifestyle factors, socioeconomic and psychosocial determinants contribute substantially to the obesity epidemic. There is a well-documented inverse relationship between socio-economic status and obesity in many societies: communities with lower income or education levels often have higher obesity rates [ 56 57 58 59 60 not The health implications of obesity are wide-ranging and profound. Excess body weight is a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases and is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Most notably, obesity greatly elevates the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke [ [61] [62] [63] 62 [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] 75 76 77 Beyond its toll on individual health, obesity imposes significant societal and economic costs. Healthcare systems are straining under the burden of treating obesity-linked diseases—ranging from diabetes management to cardiac surgeries and cancer therapies—diverting substantial resources to obesity-related care. The economic impact of obesity is evidenced by rising healthcare expenditures and losses in productivity due to illness and disability. Recent analyses estimate that by 2035, the global economic cost of overweight and obesity will reach approximately $4.32 trillion annually if current trends continue [ 78 79 The societal impact of obesity extends further into the psychosocial realm, affecting quality of life and social well-being. Individuals living with obesity often face weight-related stigma and discrimination, which can have severe psychological consequences [ [80] [81] [82] [83] 84 85 85 In light of the overwhelming evidence of obesity's consequences, public health authorities worldwide have declared the need for urgent, multi-faceted action. Leading health organizations now recognize obesity as a chronic disease and a top public health priority. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other bodies have called for comprehensive strategies to prevent and manage obesity, including promoting healthier diets and physical activity from early childhood onward [ 86 10.13039/100018696 Health 86 1.1 Definitions of obesity Obesity is a chronic and multifactorial disease characterized by excessive body fat accumulation, which significantly impairs health. The concept of obesity has also evolved with the knowledge that it is not just a response to excessive caloric intake but, rather, a problem involving interactions between genetic, environmental, behavioral, and metabolic factors. The most commonly used definition of obesity is based on the Body Mass Index, which, is measured by weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres. According to WHO, obesity is defined by a BMI at or above 30 [ 87 88 Recent literature has emphasized the fact that obesity is a disease process characterized by excessive adiposity and one that is associated with serious health hazards. In this regard, the American Medical Association in 2013 recognized obesity as a disease, affirming the position of the medical community that obesity is not a personal lifestyle choice but, instead, a medical condition that warrants treatment itself [ 89 90 1.2 Global trends and projections of obesity 1.2.1 Adult obesity Adult obesity has reached pandemic proportions and is now a major public health concern worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 87 91 92 6 54 92 The global burden of obesity is not evenly distributed and displays significant regional variations. High-income countries generally exhibit high but stable prevalence rates. For instance, in the United States, nearly 47 % of adults are obese [ 93 92 92 93 Recent data published by The Lancet 6 6 6 6 6 Projections suggest that if these trends continue, over half of the global adult population—approximately 3.80 billion people—will be living with overweight or obesity by 2050 [ 6 6 Obesity prevalence also exhibits marked disparities by age and sex. By 2030, it is anticipated that 40 % of women and 34 % of men in the Americas will be obese, with obesity rates among middle-aged adults ranging between 25 % and 30 % [ 54 91 92 92 1.2.2 Childhood obesity Childhood obesity has emerged as a significant global health concern, paralleling the rise in adult obesity and contributing to a lifetime trajectory of poor health. Recent estimates suggest that in 2022, approximately 159 million children and adolescents worldwide were living with obesity, with forecasts predicting that this number will increase to 254 million by 2035 and 390 million by 2050 if current trends persist [ 5 94 5 [95] [96] [97] The consequences of childhood obesity are both immediate and long-term. In the short term, children with obesity are at greater risk for early-onset metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which were previously considered adult conditions [ 98 99 [100] [101] [102] Prevention and management strategies for childhood obesity must be multifaceted and age-appropriate. School-based interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in promoting healthy behaviors, particularly when they include nutritional education, structured physical activity, and healthy food provision in cafeterias [ 103 104 [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] 112 1.3 Types of obesity It is essential to note that obesity is not a single condition but rather occurs in several forms. Being able to identify these different types has the potential to enable the development of more focused and effective forms of treatment. In this part, I described the different types of obesity in adults, which have been classified according to factors such as distribution of fat, metabolic syndrome, genetics, and content of muscle-fat. 1.3.1 Generalized (overall) obesity Generalized obesity is the generalized increase in body fat, which is evenly distributed in the body, for which the BMI usually diagnoses it. A BMI of 30 kg/m 2 113 1.3.2 Central (visceral) obesity Central obesity can also be referred to as visceral or abdominal obesity. It involves an accumulation of fat around the abdominal area in each internal organ. It has strong associations with metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and insulin resistance. This condition usually occurs when waist circumference is above 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women [ 114 115 1.3.3 Subcutaneous obesity Subcutaneous obesity refers to the deposition of extra fat just under the skin, usually in the hips, thighs, and buttocks. Though it contains extra fat, due to lower metabolic activity, subcutaneous fat is considered less dangerous compared to visceral fat. Moreover, individuals with subcutaneous obesity can also have a high risk for health complications if the total percentage of body fat is too high. This type of obesity is more common in females and less strongly associated with metabolic diseases than central obesity [ 114 1.3.4 Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) Metabolically Healthy Obesity (MHO) describes individuals who are classified as obese according to their BMI but do not exhibit common obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. Studies show that above 30 % of obese individuals may fit into this category [ 116 117 1.3.5 Metabolically obese, normal weight (MONW) MONW is a medical condition wherein a person with normal weight, with a BMI of 18.5–24.9 kg/m 2 118 119 1.3.6 Genetic obesity A great contribution to obesity can be made by genetic factors. Probably the most well-known genetic factor, the FTO gene stands for Fat mass and obesity-associated gene. It has been associated with higher body mass index and a greater risk of developing obesity. Individuals possessing certain variants of the FTO gene may be at heightened risk of gaining weight through childhood and adult years. Out-of-control genetic obesity is normally difficult to manage since it usually relates to innate factors that place a living organism at risk of excessive weight gain. Nonetheless, environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and lifestyle determine the magnitude at which genetic tendencies develop into obesity [ 120 121 1.3.7 Sarcopenic obesity Sarcopenic obesity refers both to age-associated loss of muscle mass and strength combined with obesity. This form of obesity is increasingly present in older adults and presents different health challenges, given the combination of the physical limitations associated with sarcopenia and metabolic risks from excess body fat. Sarcopenic obesity increases the risk to frailty and falls, further leading to decreased mobility and metabolic complications such as insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases. Special attention must be given to the treatment of sarcopenic obesity because traditional weight loss, in general, focuses only on fat reduction and may further promote muscle loss. Treatments should, therefore, be directed at fat reduction together with the preservation or increase of muscle mass through resistance training and appropriate nutrition [ 122 123 1.3.8 Hormonal obesity Different forms of hormonal imbalances and endocrine disorders can lead to obesity. For example, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome may all lead to metabolic dysfunctions that in turn commonly result in weight gain. Typically, obesity resulting from endocrine conditions is characterized by specific patterns of fat distribution, such as central obesity, and specific treatments are often required, including hormone therapy or medication to manage the underlying condition [ 124 125 1.4 Obesity calculations 1.4.1 Body mass index (BMI) The most widely used tool to assess obesity is the BMI. Very simple calculation based on weight and height, defined as weight in kilograms of a person divided by height in meters squared-BMI = kg/m 2 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Body Mass Index (BMI) classifications for weight status [ 87 Fig. 1 Where BMI does serve well as a useful screening tool, it is highly limited in capturing the complexity of obesity. For example, individuals with the same BMI can have completely different body fat contents and health risks depending on age, gender, ethnicity, and fat distribution. Because of this, researchers are calling for more sophisticated classification systems that take into consideration distribution of fat-visceral versus subcutaneous fat-metabolic health, and comorbid conditions [ 126 127 1.4.2 Body fat percentage (BFP) BFP is a more direct measurement of body composition than is BMI. It is an estimation of what percentage of a person's body mass consists of fat. A number of techniques for measuring body fat are available, including bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and skinfold measurement. All these techniques are considered more accurate measurements of obesity than is BMI, since they actually measure fleshly mass against bone and muscle. Levels of body fat exceeding 25 % in men and 33 % in women are normally considered to be indicative of obesity in adults. This measurement of body fat is very accurate, but because it requires specialized equipment and trained personnel, its use is less practical than the use of BMI in large-scale epidemiological studies [ 128 1.4.3 Waist circumference (WC) WC is the measurement of central adiposity, which is very closely related to visceral fat-the main type of fat stored around internal organs, where metabolic risk increases. Thus, even with a normal BMI, studies have been able to demonstrate that individuals with excess visceral fat are more susceptible to conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [ 129 For men, a waist circumference greater than 102 cm (40 inches) and for women, greater than 88 cm (35 inches), indicates a higher risk for obesity-related health problems [ 130 1.4.4 Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) The WHR is another technique that takes into account the distribution of fat. That is, the ratio of the circumference of the waist is compared to that of the hips [ 131 132 1.4.5 Waist-to-hight ratio (WHtR) Waist-to-Height Ratio is a simple yet highly effective tool in the assessment of central obesity and cardiometabolic risk. In fact, studies have indicated that WHtR can be used as a better predictor of cardiometabolic risk factors than the other anthropometric measures of BMI and waist circumference alone, especially because the latter takes into consideration fat distribution around the abdomen-an important factor in metabolic health. Hence, a WHtR of over 0.5 is generally considered as reflective of higher risk. Indeed, evidence of these facts shows that WHtR can be applied across different age, sex, and ethnic groups, and is flexible as well as a reliable measure for clinical assessments [ 133 134 1.4.6 Relative fat mass (RFM) RFM is the more modern method used to approximate the quantity of body fat based on height and waist size [ 135 136 1.4.7 Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a non-invasive measurement of body composition in which a small, harmless electrical current is introduced into the body tissues to estimate body composition by measuring the resistance of body tissues to an electrical current. The principle behind BIA is that lean tissues are more conductive of electricity than fatty tissues due to the greater water content. BIA is quick and non-invasive and, therefore, convenient for field and clinical use [ 137 1.5 Factors affecting of obesity development The various factors that have been contributing to the obesity epidemic represented in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 The principal factors leading to obesity. source [ 138 Fig. 2 1.5.1 Biological factors of obesity Biological factors are one of the causes of obesity, which includes genetics [ 139 140 141 142 Other critical factors in obesity include metabolic dysfunctions. People with lower basal metabolic rates have a tendency to store more fat, thereby becoming vulnerable to weight gain. Insulin resistance, common among obese individuals, promotes fat storage through excessive deposition, especially in the abdominal area. Such a state of metabolic disequilibrium highly influences many diseases that come hand in hand with obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disorders [ 143 At the same time, not less crucial for obesity is hormonal regulation. Usually, leptin suppresses appetite; via leptin resistance, it becomes less effective in obese individuals, which causes overeating [ 144 145 146 147 148 1.5.2 Behavioral factors of obesity Behavioral factors play a big role in problems with obesity mainly through lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, and emotional eating [ 147 149 [150] [151] [152] 152 The second major factor contributing to obesity is unhealthy dietary habits, especially the excessive consumption of foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients. High-fat, high-sugar foods are pervasive and heavily marketed; this stimulates overeating, generally leading individuals to take in more calories than they actually need [ 153 154 138 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Energy balance and its impact on weight regulation. Fig. 3 Other critical behavioral factors involve emotional eating, where one eats in response to negative emotions, such as stress, anxiety, or even sadness. This leads to overeating and overindulgence in comfort foods, which are usually highly loaded with sugar and fat. Poorer emotional regulation and resorting to poor coping mechanisms for dealing with stress have also been associated with this behavior [ 155 60 Chronic stress also plays a major role in influencing the behavioral patterns that lead to obesity [ 156 157 157 1.5.3 Environmental factors of obesity in adults The environmental factors are major contributors to increasing rates of obesity in the world today. Among the most critical environmental influences on obesity, those related to build environment stand at the top [ 158 159 160 161 162 The nutritional environment is another formidable environmental factor. Over the past decades, foods that are nutritionally unhealthy and calorie-dense became much more accessible, available, and affordable. Often, heavily marketed and cheaply sold foods contain high levels of fats and sugars, whereas healthier foods are more expensive, making these products more accessible to lower-income parts of the population. It's a shift that has helped create an atmosphere in which overeating is encouraged, hence too many calories are taken in, and obesity results. Research has underlined just how much food marketing and the pervasive availability of fast food breed less-than-healthy eating and weight gain patterns, especially in neighbourhoods where healthier options are not as accessible [ 138 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 The relationship between Ultra-Processed Food (UPF) foods and obesity. Source [ 138 Fig. 4 The socioeconomic variables also play a vital role in obesity. The lower-income population is more vulnerable due to the fact that they have a low availability of healthy food stores and recreational areas [ 163 164 165 1.5.4 Psychological and social factors of obesity Psychological and social factors highly contribute to the development and persistence of obesity. A key factor on the psychological side is emotional distress, often associated with overeating. Most people use food as their coping mechanism to overcome stress, anxiety, or depression through emotional eating. In such emotional eating, individuals eat not because of hunger but to suppress an avoidance behavior from unwanted feelings. Again, this maladaptive coping strategy almost always involves high-calorie, energy-dense foods and thus results in weight gain. Research has shown that emotional distress, when combined with socio-economic disadvantages, induces a vicious circle of emotional eating, stress, and further weight gain [ 166 Another important factor of psychological burden of obesity is the weight-related stigma. In general, people with obesity may be stigmatized, that then often can develop into low self-esteem, social withdrawal, and even chronic stress [ 2 167 Other social factors involve support systems and familial relationships that could also serve as a factor in obesity. Researchers have documented that individuals from socioeconomic disadvantages, or those with limited social support, are at an increased risk for psychological distress and emotional eating [ 168 169 1.5.5 Medical and pharmaceutical factors of obesity One of the major contributors to obesity includes medical and pharmaceutical ones. Generally, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, and PCOS are some of the endocrine disorders shared in inducing weight gain [ 124 170 171 The other major medical cause of obesity is Cushing's syndrome, a condition attributed to overproduction of cortisol from either endogenous overproduction or the use of corticosteroid medications over an extended period. Increased cortisol levels enhance visceral fat accumulation, especially in the abdomen, along with other signs like muscle wasting and hypertension. Among patients with Cushing's syndrome, there is often extensive central obesity; the resolution of the cause, such as a reduction in corticosteroid use or treatment of a pituitary tumor leading to overproduction of cortisol, may be associated with dramatic weight loss [ 172 Another prevalent endocrine disorder is Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is found to be associated with obesity in the majority of women afflicted by it. PCOS results in hormonal disturbance, insulin resistance, and hyperandrogenism, all of which favor weight gain, notably in the visceral area. In this regard, the pathogenesis of obesity can, in turn, accentuate the clinical features of PCOS by entering into a vicious circle of sexual hormone disturbance and weight gain. Lifestyle modification, diet, and medication like metformin that may improve insulin sensitivity could be helpful in weight loss among women with PCOS [ 173 Another contributing factor to obesity may be drugs that are used for the treatment of other diseases. Most prescribed antidepressants, including the commonly used SSRIs, mood stabilizers such as lithium, and antipsychotics, are well associated with weight gain [ 174 175 1.5.6 Cultural and regional variations in obesity drivers Obesity prevalence and its underlying determinants vary significantly across regions, reflecting the interplay between cultural, economic, and environmental factors. Cultural beliefs, traditional diets, and social norms strongly influence obesity risk and shape the effectiveness of intervention strategies. In the Middle East, for example, rapid economic development, urbanization, and a shift from traditional diets to high-calorie, processed foods have driven a marked increase in obesity rates—particularly among women, who often face barriers to physical activity due to gender norms [ 176 [177] [178] [179] In contrast, Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia have traditionally maintained plant-rich diets and high physical activity levels through agrarian lifestyles. However, economic transitions and urban sprawl have introduced Western dietary influences and sedentary behaviors, contributing to rising obesity trends, especially in urban youth populations [ 180 Sub-Saharan Africa presents a unique dual burden: undernutrition coexists with rising obesity in urban settings. In some African cultures, larger body size is still associated with prosperity, fertility, or beauty, which may inadvertently promote overeating or discourage weight-loss behaviors [ 181 [182] [183] [184] [185] In Western nations, obesity is more often linked to socioeconomic disparities. Low-income populations face greater exposure to ultra-processed foods due to food deserts and often lack time or resources for physical activity. Social determinants, including education and healthcare access, have a strong impact on obesity-related outcomes [ 186 Therefore, effective obesity interventions must be tailored to regional and cultural contexts. For example, in the Middle East, culturally sensitive women-only fitness programs have proven successful, while in Southeast Asia, policies that promote active transportation and protect traditional diets show promise. Recognizing and integrating cultural practices into intervention design enhances community acceptance and sustainability. Global strategies should thus be flexible and region-specific, balancing universal principles with local adaptations. 1.5.7 Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying obesity At the molecular level, obesity is underpinned by complex dysfunctions in adipocyte biology, metabolic signaling, immune activation, and gene regulation. Excess nutrient intake and sedentary behavior drive adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, particularly in visceral fat depots. This triggers a cascade of cellular stress responses that ultimately lead to chronic low-grade inflammation, hormonal imbalance, and systemic metabolic disruption. In obesity, expanding adipose tissue becomes hypoxic and dysfunctional. Hypertrophic adipocytes secrete excess pro-inflammatory adipokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while beneficial adipokines like adiponectin are suppressed [ 187 188 As adipocytes enlarge, immune cells—particularly M1 macrophages—infiltrate the tissue, releasing additional cytokines and sustaining a chronic inflammatory state [ 189 190 191 Emerging evidence shows that obesity is associated with epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA regulation, which influence gene expression patterns involved in metabolism, adipogenesis, and inflammation [ 192 193 The gut microbiome plays a critical role in nutrient absorption, energy harvest, and immune modulation. Obese individuals often exhibit a higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, which promotes increased caloric extraction from food and facilitates lipid storage [ 194 195 1.6 Health consequences of obesity Obesity comorbidities may include cardiovascular risks such as heart attack and stroke, metabolic disorders such as Type 2 diabetes and liver disease, cancer, and kidney failure. Obesity further contributes to osteoarthritis and pain in the joints, infertility, sleep apnea, depression, and skin fold rashes. Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Highlights the extensive impact of obesity on various organs. Fig. 5 1.6.1 Cardiovascular consequences of obesity One of the most accessible and earliest cardiovascular effects of obesity is hypertension [ 61 196 197 There is a very close relation between CAD and obesity due to the unyielding process of systemic inflammation and atherosclerotic plaques building up in the arteries. What is more important, abdominal obesity normally acts as one of the major driving forces for developing CAD, managing to enhance visceral fat deposition, which is very harmful and increases cardiovascular risks [ 62 The other major result of obesity is heart failure. The excess weight puts the heart under increased pressure, which contributes to both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Obesity-related heart failure is on the rise, considering the rates of obesity itself are improving along with its associated metabolic disturbances, such as insulin resistance [ 198 Obese conditions serve as a source for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke due to the combined effects of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and the pro-inflammatory state contributed by obesity [ 199 62 1.6.2 Metabolic disorders consequences of obesity Obesity is closely associated with type 2 diabetes because excess body fat promotes insulin resistance. When cells become resistant to insulin, the uptake of glucose into the cells becomes impaired, leading to increased blood sugar levels and a greater risk of diabetes. Weight loss has been shown to significantly improve insulin sensitivity and, therefore, decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes [ 200 Metabolic syndrome is characterized by central obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. It is very common in obese subjects and powerfully predicts cardiovascular disease. NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is very common in this population [ 201 Dyslipidemia is commonly featured in obesity; it consists of a high level of triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol. Such dysregulation further predisposes an individual to cardiovascular disease and is closely associated with obesity, especially when there is deposition of abdominal fat. Weight reduction improves the lipid profile and decreases the risk of complications arising from dyslipidemia [ 202 NAFLD is a liver disease strongly associated with obesity. It encompasses a disease spectrum extending from simple fatty liver to cirrhosis. NAFLD enhances insulin resistance and fuels the development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes [ 203 1.6.3 Respiratory and sleep related consequences of obesity Obese-related factors are a few of the most important risk factors for respiratory and sleep-related issues. Of these, the most important conditions include obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and asthma. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is very common in people suffering from obesity. It results from fat accumulation around the neck and uppermost airway, obstructing the air passage during sleep [ 204 205 Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS) is defined by the presence of obesity in combination with daytime hypercapnia and sleep-disordered breathing. The majority of these patients do have OSA, but it is not a requirement for diagnosis. The hypoventilation that often characterizes OHS during sleep results in chronic respiratory failure if the condition is left untreated. Treatment of OHS generally focuses on the use of PAP therapy, often in conjunction with attempts at weight management, as symptoms can be considerably improved with weight loss [ 206 Asthma also tends to be higher in obese individuals, and indeed studies have proved that excess weight enhances symptoms of asthma, hence leading to poor respiratory outcomes. The mechanisms involved are not yet fully comprehended, but it is believed that inflammation, mechanical changes in pulmonary function, and airway responsiveness play key roles. Moreover, weight loss has been able to reduce asthma symptoms in obese patients, reinforcing the thought that management of body weight is principal in respiratory health [ 207 1.6.4 Musculoskeletal consequences of obesity Obesity is known to be a risk factor for several musculoskeletal disorders, like osteoarthritis, lower back pain, and gout. This excess weight places greater stress on the joints, tendons, and bones, hastening wear and tear processes, especially in weight-bearing joints such as the knees and hips [ 208 Osteoarthritis is the most common musculoskeletal disease associated with obesity. In addition to the mechanical load on the joints, the increase in body weight promotes the breakdown of cartilage and the inflammatory pain. Recently, the low-grade inflammation characteristic of obese individuals was also thought to accelerate further the course of OA, making this condition not strictly a mechanical problem but also a metabolic one [ 68 209 The other common musculoskeletal condition in the obese population is lower back pain. The excess weight modifies the biomechanics of the spine and increases the stress exerted on the intervertebral disc and muscles supporting the back [ 210 211 Besides, gout is another form of inflammatory arthritis that is also very strongly associated with obesity. With a high body mass index, uric acid production increases, followed by crystallization of the substance in joints, thus triggering painful gout attacks. It has been found from study that management of obesity-which involves reducing weight and changing eating habits-can be responsible for less frequency and severity in the flare-ups of gout [ 212 1.6.5 Cancer related obesity Obesity is also known to raise the risk for a variety of cancers, hence being a serious public health concern ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Highlights Major cancers associated with obesity. Fig. 6 In postmenopausal women, obesity increases the likelihood of a new diagnosis of breast cancer. Extra body fat exposes a person to higher levels of estrogen, which can feed the growth of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancers. Obesity has also been linked with poorer prognosis and increased mortality among women diagnosed with breast cancer [ 73 213 214 215 Obesity heightens the risk of pancreatic cancer by contributing to insulin resistance and higher circulating levels of insulin, which are then associated with the development of tumors in the pancreas. Obesity also increases the mortality rate in individuals affected with pancreatic cancer [ 73 216 217 218 219 220 1.7 Management and prevention strategies of obesity 1.7.1 Behavioural interventions for management of obesity Behavioral interventions play a vital role in the management of obesity through lifestyle modification for long-term weight loss and maintenance [ 221 222 The other component of behavioral interventions, and an essential one, is physical activity. According to recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, there should be at least 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, with strength training exercises included [ 223 224 Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has emerged as an effective approach to obesity management, as it identifies the psychosocial bases of unhealthy eating. CBT helps individuals recognize and modify maladaptive thoughts and behaviors related to food, stress, and body image [ 225 226 There is a growing incorporation of various forms of mindfulness-based approaches, including mindful eating, into behavioral treatments. These practices allow individuals to become more aware of internal signs of hunger and fullness to improve their self-regulation of eating and not engage in emotional eating or bingeing. The limited research conducted has indicated that the addition of mindfulness practices to dietary and physical activity interventions produces greater body mass index reductions and an overall improvement in eating behaviors [ 227 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Various lifestyle modifications to prevent and manage obesity. Fig. 7 1.7.2 Pharmacological interventions for management of obesity Pharmacological interventions have become the critical component in treating obesity, particularly for those individuals who fail to achieve adequate weight loss by means of lifestyle modification. Such interventions are intended to facilitate weight loss by acting on appetite regulation, energy balance, and fat absorption. Several antiobesity drugs are approved for long-term treatment, with effectiveness and safety differing between them ( Table 1 Table 1 Obesity treatment drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Table 1 Name Mechanism of Action Route of Administration Recommended Dose Expected Weight Loss, kg Liraglutide GLP-1 agonist Subcutaneous 3 mg once a day 5.7–8 Semaglutide GLP-1 agonist Subcutaneous 2.4 mg once a week 9.7–15.3 Tirzepatide∗ GLP-1/GIP agonist Subcutaneous 15 mg once a week 9.5–23.6 Orlistat Lipase inhibitor Oral 120 mg three times a day 5.8–10.6 Phentermine-Topiramate Sympathomimetic amine anorectic/antiepileptic combination Oral 7.5 mg/46 mg once a day 9.2–12.4 Bupropion-naltrexone Opioid antagonist/antidepressant combination Oral 16 mg/180 mg twice a day 3.6–9.3 Note: ∗Tirzepatide is still under evaluation by the FDA for obesity treatment approval. Abbreviations: GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. Source [ 228 Notable examples of pharmacologic agents for the management of obesity include liraglutide and semaglutide, which are part of the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. Liraglutide has been shown to induce clinically significant reductions in body weight when administered at a dosage of 3.0 mg/day by inducing appetite-suppressing effects, thereby making the subject fuller. Semaglutide, given once weekly at 2.4 mg, has been shown to be more effective than other drugs available today [ 229 230 Other drugs include the drug combination of naltrexone/bupropion, which acts on the central nervous system to decrease appetite and food intake for pleasure [ 231 232 Orlistat-a lipase inhibitor that decreases the absorption of dietary fat-has been available for many years; however its use has also been limited due to gastrointestinal side effects, including oily stools and increased bowel movements [ 233 228 Among emerging pharmacological treatments, the dual agonist of GLP-1 and GIP receptors, tirzepatide, is promising for even greater weight loss than that achieved with current therapies [ 234 1.7.3 Surgical interventions for management of obesity Bariatric surgery is a well-established and highly effective treatment for severe obesity, particularly for patients who have failed to achieve substantial weight loss through either lifestyle modification or pharmacological interventions. It is associated with substantial long-term weight loss and improvement in comorbidities related to obesity, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Recent literature has reassured the long-term merits of bariatric surgery in its capabilities to decrease all-cause mortality and prolong life expectancy, in obese patients with and without diabetes [ 235 236 The two most common types of bariatric surgery, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), result in similar weight loss patterns at five years, although the duodenal switch procedure tends to have even greater weight loss and a higher resolution of comorbidities. Most importantly, bariatric surgery was found to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes in a lot of patients, largely due to improvements in insulin sensitivity and changes in gut hormones after the procedure. Besides the effect of weight loss, there is a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia following bariatric surgery, which reduces the risk of long-term mortality. [ 237 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Illustrates three weight loss surgical interventions. Fig. 8 Although bariatric surgery provides many benefits, the procedure is not without risks. Nutritional deficiencies following the course of changes in the absorptive capacity of nutrients after surgery are common complications, which are essential to maintain. Nutrient deficiencies and supplementation will require long-term follow-up care. Other potential long-term complications include weight regain and revisional surgery if suboptimal weight loss or other complications such as symptomatic GERD develop. Indeed, some studies have indicated that although RYGB offers superior outcomes in terms of long-term weight maintenance and resolution of GERD, SG has fewer short-term complications and may be preferred for selected patients [ 238 In conclusion, bariatric surgery is a powerful intervention for severe obesity with impressive, long-term benefits related to weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, and overall mortality. It does, however, require careful selection of patients and lifelong follow-up for optimal outcomes and the management of potential risks. 1.7.4 Lifestyle and environmental interventions Community-based interventions have been one of the leading methods of tackling obesity in adults. Community-based programs can improve healthier behaviors through better access to more nutritious foods and increased opportunities for physical activity. The CDC 239 Workplace wellness programs also play an important part in preventing obesity in adults. It targets employees through workplace wellness programs that provide resources regarding healthy food, exercise facilities, and education on health. Evidence shows that workplace interventions are effective in reducing body weight and improving general health, particularly when the focus of these interventions is nutrition and physical activity. Wellness programs may be particularly effective in male-dominated workplaces where it has been traditionally very difficult to engage employees in health promotion [ 240 Public health campaigns can also be effective; these are usually supported by the government and local organizations in effecting healthy lifestyle changes. Examples include reducing sugar-sweetened drink consumption and increasing physical activity. They often take policy-driven approaches where there is a basis for implementing taxes on unhealthy foods or improving access to recreational facilities. Indeed, such a multifaceted intervention has been shown to create healthier behaviors and improve weight-related outcomes in large populations [ 241 1.7.5 Preventive strategies Prevention strategies for obesity aim at early intervention and the sustenance of lifestyle modification in order to address the complex interaction of behavioral, environmental, and physiological components that are causative. Public health campaigns and policy-driven initiatives now meaningfully promote healthier environments. On the rise are the promulgation of public policies aimed at promoting physical activities, enhancing access to healthy foods, and placing restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy products. Indeed, studies have documented that population-level interventions, including the imposition of a tax on sweetened beverages and a clearer labeling of food items, result in modest yet significant reductions in dietary caloric intake and promote healthier eating behaviors [ 242 Public health education has also played a very important role in the prevention of obesity, particularly by emphasizing early intervention. Awareness for healthy eating and physical activity raises the chances of behavior change regarding the prevention of conditions leading to obesity among populations at high risk. Early educational programs targeting adults and communities have been successful, especially those using new technologies and tailored approaches in changing knowledge and healthier lifestyles [ 243 Lifestyle changes in a sustainable manner are crucial to preventing obesity. Lifestyle modification programs with intensive long-term changes in diet, exercise, and behavior are required for the maintenance of weight loss in the long term. Community or online support for long-term adherence is often emphasized besides individualized programs of dietary adjustment and increase in physical activities. Most effective interventions include behavioral counseling, which would help the individual with emotional eating by developing ways to cope with stress that would support long-term weight loss [ 222 1.7.6 Global policy interventions Real-world policy interventions offer valuable insights into effective strategies for curbing obesity. Countries that have implemented bold regulatory and fiscal measures provide a template for evidence-based public health policy. In 2014, Mexico introduced a nationwide excise tax of 1 peso per liter (approximately 10 %) on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), aiming to reduce consumption and tackle rising obesity and diabetes rates. Evaluations showed a 5.5 % reduction in SSB purchases in the first year, rising to 9.7 % in the second year, with greater declines among lower-income households [ 244 245 246 [247] [248] [249] 250 251 2 Implications for public health policy The rising tide of obesity carries profound implications for health systems and policy-makers. Effective management of this epidemic demands a multi-sectoral public health response. Government policy intervention is vital to stem the obesity crisis, both to prevent new cases and to manage existing ones. Without decisive action, many countries risk their healthcare services becoming overwhelmed by obesity-related illnesses. The findings of this review support policies that create healthier food and physical activity environments – for example, implementing taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, mandating clearer nutritional labeling, and restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods. Such population-level measures have been shown to yield modest but significant improvements in dietary habits and caloric intake. It is also crucial to address socioeconomic and regional disparities in obesity prevalence. High-income countries have plateaued at elevated obesity rates, while low- and middle-income countries are experiencing rapid increases, often alongside persistent undernutrition. This dual burden means policies must be tailored to local contexts – strengthening food security and nutrition on one hand, and curbing obesogenic factors on the other. In summary, public health policy should prioritize obesity prevention as a key component of non-communicable disease control, allocate resources for obesity treatment programs, and foster environments that make healthy choices easier for the population. 3 Future research directions Despite extensive research, significant knowledge gaps remain in our understanding and treatment of obesity. Future research should continue to unravel the complex biological and social determinants of obesity – for instance, investigating gene–environment interactions, the gut microbiome's role in weight regulation, and the impact of early-life nutrition on long-term obesity risk. There is also a need for long-term studies on the e 4 Conclusion Obesity is a multifaceted and escalating global health crisis that requires urgent, comprehensive intervention. This article highlights the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors contributing to the rising prevalence of obesity, which now affects over one billion individuals worldwide. The severe health consequences associated with obesity—including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and diminished quality of life—underscore its classification as a chronic disease requiring sustained management rather than short-term weight loss efforts. Effective public health policies must address obesogenic environments through regulatory measures such as food taxation, improved urban planning, and restrictions on unhealthy food marketing, while clinical management should integrate lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy, and, in severe cases, bariatric surgery. Future research should focus on refining long-term obesity interventions, exploring emerging therapeutic approaches, and evaluating policy-driven strategies to create sustainable, evidence-based solutions. Ultimately, reducing the global burden of obesity demands coordinated efforts at individual, community, and systemic levels to promote healthier lifestyles, equitable healthcare access, and robust preventive frameworks. 5 Recommendations for obesity prevention and management Based on the findings of this article, several key recommendations can be made to guide practitioners and policy-makers in combating the obesity epidemic.
