However, on-target BTK mutations facilitating evasion from BTK inhibition lead to resistance that limits the therapeutic efficacy of BTK inhibitors. In this study we employed structure-based drug design strategies based on established BTK inhibitors and yielded a series of BTK targeting compounds. Among them, compound S-016 bearing a unique tricyclic structure exhibited potent BTK kinase inhibitory activity with an IC 50 50 Keywords diffuse large B-cell lymphoma BTK inhibitors drug resistance BTK C481F BTK A428D SYHA1813 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Pharmacological Society 2024 ",
