Introduction Consuming medicinal plants to prevent and treat illness and maintain good health is an age-old practice [ 1 Gynostemma pentaphyllum 2 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 8 10 11 6 ® ® 12 13 12 13 14 15 Inflammation is an immune response that occurs when the body fights against endogenous and exogenous stimuli to protect itself [ 16 16 17 16 18 19 20 18 19 18 21 22 21 23 24 To investigate the anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms of AP, DA, and DB, we used LPS-induced RAW264.7 and carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats. In RAW264.7 cells, AP, DA, and DB significantly suppressed the expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6, which were increased by LPS, and we confirmed that these effects may involve MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. In addition, in a carrageenan-induced paw edema inflammation model, AP was administered for 4 h and showed a significant inhibition of edema over time in a concentration-dependent manner. 2. Results 2.1. Effect of AP, DA, and DB on Viability of RAW264.7 Cells The cytotoxicity of AP, DA, and DB on RAW264.7 cells was analyzed using the CCK-8 assay. AP had no effect on cell viability up to 200 μg/mL, whereas DA and DB had no effects up to 16 μM ( Figure 1 2.2. Inhibitory Effect of AP, DA, and DB on the LPS-Induced NO Production and iNOS Expression in RAW264.7 Cells To analyze the anti-inflammatory effects of AP, DA, and DB, LPS was used to stimulate the release of NO and iNOS from macrophages to indirectly create a chronic inflammatory environment. The LPS group showed significantly higher NO production than the control group ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.3. Inhibitory Effect of AP, DA, and DB on LPS-Induced PGE2 Production and COX-2 Expression in RAW264.7 Cells As inflammation causes itching and pain, changes in PGE2 production and COX-2 expression induced by AP, DA, and DB were analyzed. LPS alone significantly increased the PGE2 production (5656.64 ± 51.23 pg/mL); however, pretreatment with AP prevented this effect, showing a 18% inhibition rate at 160 μg/mL (4640.96 ± 53.18 pg/mL) ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.4. Inhibitory Effect of AP, DA, and DB on LPS-Induced Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in RAW264.7 Cells Cytokines are important proteins that transmit intracellular signals and regulate inflammatory responses [ 16 17 25 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.5. Inhibition of AP, DA, and DB on NF-κB Signaling Pathway in LPS-Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells NF-κB is a transcription factor closely related to inflammation and immune response. When NF-κB is activated, IκB-α is phosphorylated and degraded, and accordingly, the NF-κB subunit p65 is phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of inflammation-related factors such as iNOS, COX-2, NO, PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-6. Therefore, to evaluate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of AP, DA, and DB on inflammatory-related factors, we analyzed the phosphorylation of IκB-α and p65. LPS stimulation for 30 min increased the phosphorylation of IκB-α and boosted the phosphorylation of p65 ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.6. Inhibition of AP, DA, and DB on MAPKs in LPS-Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells In eukaryotes, MAPKs consist of ERK, JNK, and p38, which regulate the expression of inflammation-related cells. To determine whether the inhibitory effects of AP, DA, and DB on LPS-induced inflammation-related factors were mediated through the MAPK signaling pathway, we analyzed the effects of AP, DA, and DB on the LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 in RAW 264.7 cells by Western blot. LPS stimulation for 30 min increased the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 ( Figure 5 Figure 5 2.7. Effects of AP on Carrageenan-Induced Rat Paw Edema The anti-inflammatory effects of AP were evaluated 4 h after carrageenan injection in a mouse model of carrageenan-induced paw edema. Compared to the control group, the group injected with carrageenan alone showed a significant increase in paw thickness, whereas the experimental group, to which AP (30, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight) was orally administered 1 h prior, showed a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in paw thickness ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 3. Discussion Inflammation is the most basic physiological response of the human body and is triggered by the phagocytosis of immune cells to protect the body from external or internal irritants. Inflammatory responses that cannot be adequately controlled after the removal of irritants are potential risk factors for various diseases and are known to accelerate the onset of cancer and colon, brain, and joint diseases [ 16 16 26 Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP), a medicinal plant used to treat rheumatism and diabetes [ 2 ® 12 27 27 Macrophages are distributed throughout all body tissues and are involved in the initiation or delay of several diseases, including infections, immunity, inflammation, and cancer [ 19 28 16 19 29 17 25 26 17 26 14 18 21 22 30 31 21 22 30 31 32 21 33 To verify the anti-inflammatory effect of AP, edema was induced in the paws of rats using carrageenan, and the alleviation of paw edema was analyzed. Carrageenan-induced paw edema is typically used as an in vivo model to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects [ 34 34 35 36 37 38 39 37 38 39 40 41 Despite finding beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of AP, DA, and DB, this study has several limitations. First, the efficacy of AP, DA, and DB was confirmed through pretreatment. The pretreatment method was chosen because this study was focused on the preventive level, like health-functional foods. However, to achieve a broader therapeutic effect, it is necessary to establish scientific evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of simultaneous and post-treatment in the future. It is also believed that further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of DA and DB. DA and DB are pure compounds that have potential for development into future pharmaceuticals. In this study, we confirmed through protein expression analysis that they contain MAPK and NF-κB signaling. However, if we can provide a clear mechanism through research into which site they directly or indirectly induce activity, they will be highly valuable as new drug candidates. 4.

Inducing Edema in Rat Paws with Carrageenan An anti-inflammatory experimental method for suppressing paw edema was developed by Akinnawo et al. [ 40 w v Inhibition rate (%) = ((Ct − C0)control − (Ct − C0)treated)/(Ct − C0)control × 100 Ct = paw thickness (mm) of the left hind limb at time t. C0 = paw thickness (mm) of the left hind limb before carrageenan injection. (Ct−C0)control = increase in paw size after carrageenan injection at time t (Ct−C0)treated = increase in paw size after carrageenan injection at time t of reference or test drug-treated rats. The rats ( n Group 1 (Control) = nothing. Group 2 (vehicle)= 1% carrageenan + vehicle (0.9% saline). Group 3–6 (AP30–200 mg/kg body weight) = 1% carrageenan + 30, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight of AP dissolved in 0.9% saline, respectively). Group 7 (Diclofenac) = 1% carrageenan + 10 mg/kg body weight, diclofenac dissolved in 0.9% saline). 4.8. Statistical Analysis All experimental data were obtained from at least three independent experiments, with the exception of the in vivo experiments. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) and Graphpad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). Gene expression and paw thickness data were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Duncan’s multiple-range test and Tukey’s test, respectively. All results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Results with p 5. Conclusions In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect and its mechanism of AP, DA, and DB in RAW264.7 cells and carrageenan-induced paw edema model. Our results demonstrated that AP, DA, and DB have anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing inflammatory-mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through the inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling in the LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses. In addition, AP gradually suppressed edema over time from 1.5 to 4 h after carrageenan injection, suggesting that it may exert anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandin, and cytokines. These results are considered remarkable compared to other natural extracts, which show anti-inflammatory effects at a later stage (3–4 h), and are thought to have great potential for the development of various anti-inflammation-based therapeutic agents in the future.
