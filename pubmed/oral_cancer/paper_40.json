Patients with DGE experience symptoms of nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate solid food and prolonged dependence on a nasogastric tube (> 7 days), leading to extended hospital stay. A potential mean to reduce DGE is reconstruction after PD with addition of Braun’s enteroenterostomy (BE), an anastomosis between the afferent and efferent jejunal limbs distal to the gastrojejunostomy (GJ). Previous prospective-cohort studies and few small randomised controlled studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of BE in reducing DGE. Aim of this study is to obtain robust evidence for the effectiveness of BE in reducing DGE in patients undergoing PD. Methods The REMBRANDT trial is a multicentre, patient-observer blinded, randomised controlled trial. Adult patients undergoing open PD are recruited in 12 participating centres. Primary outcome is the incidence of DGE. Secondary outcomes include postoperative complications, such as postoperative pancreatic fistula, anastomotic leakage and mortality. Additionally, the study will assess length of hospital stay, patient-reported outcomes, functional outcomes after 12 months and costs. Randomisation is performed intraoperatively (1:1) with stratification of groups by centre, with a sample size of 128 patients per arm. Discussion This trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Braun anastomosis in reducing delayed gastric emptying after open pancreatoduodenectomy. Throughout the trial, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with surgeons in order to perform a barrier-facilitator analysis, allowing for successful implementation of BE if proven effective.

BE is an anastomosis between the afferent and efferent jejunal limb of the GJ and is performed in addition to Child reconstruction (Fig. 1 8 10 11 12 Over the past decade, multiple studies have been performed to study the effectiveness of several different reconstruction techniques after PD. A meta-analysis by Zhou et al. provides a complete overview of studies investigating the effectiveness of solely adding BE [ 13 9 11 p p 14 p I 2 12 These meta-analyses are favourable towards BE-Child, but they do not provide robust evidence for implementation of BE as standard treatment, since the included studies have limitations. First, the majority of the included studies were non-blinded, non-randomised, observational studies and therefore potentially subject to selection and observer bias. Second, the RCTs that were included had low sample sizes, which led to insufficient power to truly assess the effectiveness of BE. Third, there was significant heterogeneity among the studies ( I 2 I 2 13 14 Objectives {7} Primary objective The REMBRANDT trial’s objective is to assess the effectiveness of adding a Braun enteroenterostomy to Child reconstruction (BE-Child) in reducing the rate of DGE grade B/C after open pancreatoduodenectomy. Secondary objectives To assess the effectiveness of BE-Child after PD in reducing the rate of POPF grade B/C (ISGPS definition), anastomotic leak (HJ and GJ), Clavien-Dindo grade III complications, hospital length of stay, in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, functional outcome at 12 months, patient-reported outcomes (EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26, QoR-15) and costs. Trial design {8} The REMBRANDT trial is a multicentre, patient and observer blinded, superiority randomised controlled trial. The primary and secondary outcomes will be collected through the mandatory nationwide Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Audit (DPCA). Patients will be randomised with a 1:1 ratio intraoperatively and clustered per centre. A schematic overview of the trial design is presented in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Schematic overview of trial design.

These centres comprise both academic medical centres (UMCs) and non-academic hospitals. Data will be collected in the Netherlands. A list of study sites can be obtained from https://dpcg.nl/studie/rembrandt/ https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05709197?term=rembrandt&rank=1 Eligibility criteria {10} All consecutive adult patients planned for open PD in the participating centres will be asked to participate. The majority of patients will have malignant periampullary tumours ((suspected) pancreatic head cancer, distal common bile duct cancer, duodenal cancer). However, patients with benign tumours, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) or adenomas, are also included. Inclusion criteria Patients must meet the following inclusion criteria: Undergoing open pancreatoduodenectomy Provided informed consent Age over 18 years Exclusion criteria A potential subject that meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: Insufficient control of the Dutch language to read the patient information and to fill out the questionnaires in Dutch hospitals Previous bariatric surgery (such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, gastric sleeve) Pregnancy Bowel motility disorders Minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy Gastric outlet obstruction: defined as subjects with a preoperative nasogastric decompression tube in place and/or in whom an oral feeding tube, if necessary, cannot be placed beyond the obstruction during preoperative endoscopy Who will take informed consent? {26a} Patients will be recruited in the outpatient clinic when they visit the consulting surgeon. The surgeon or a member of the treatment team will inform the patient about possible trial participation in the REMBRANDT trial. If the patient is interested in the trial, the patient information brochure is provided, and the concept of informed consent is explained. The patient will have at least 24 h to read the patients’ information and consider participation in the study. After at least 24 h, the patient will be contacted by a member of the study team to ask for consent. In case of consent, the study team member will document this in the electronic patient file and the baseline questionnaire will be send. Written informed consent will be obtained before surgery during hospital admission. In this way, patients will not be burdened with an extra outpatient clinical visit in the small timeframe before surgery for only signing informed consent. In accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO), physicians have been assigned to provide independent information about the trial and possible benefits and harms. Patients will be notified that after signing informed consent it is still possible to leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so without any consequences. Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens {26b} The informed consent form given to the participants will contain an additional question regarding consent to contact the participant for future studies. Interventions Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b} Patients will be informed that participation in the REMBRANDT trial means that during PD they will either undergo the standard procedure (Child reconstruction) or the intervention being studied (BE-Child reconstruction). Because the study is blinded to patients, they will not know their group allocation. Intervention description {11a} All patients will undergo open PD. The reconstruction technique will not be standardised. Meaning the surgeon is able to perform the PD as he or she normally would (antecolic, retrocolic, pylorus-preserving or with distal gastric resection). The reason for not standardising PD is two-fold. By not standardising PD, trial participation becomes more feasible, and the resulting study outcome will have increased external validity. To minimise inter-surgeon variability, the BE procedure will be standardised. The surgeon will perform the following steps: Step 1: The afferent and efferent jejunal limbs of the GJ are identified. Step 2: A distance of 20 cm from the GJ is measured to determine the location for the BE. Step 3: At 20 cm from the GJ, a side-to-side anastomosis is created, 6 cm in width, with slight traction on the bowel. Step 4: The anastomosis is hand-sewn using a monofilament PDS 3–0 (or equivalent) in a one-layer running suture. This is measured using a ruler and recorded with a photo (Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Intraoperative photo of Braun anastomosis To ensure protocol adherence and minimise inter-surgeon variability, protocol training will be provided during the study initiation visit, and a photo of the BE will be submitted to the national study coordinator. A step-by-step protocol for both the construction of the BE and the standardised photo documentation is provided in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Step-by-step protocol with instructions for BE and photo documentation Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b} The investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons. If a patient does not receive PD due to intraoperative findings that suggest metastasis, the patient will not be randomised to the control group or the intervention group since this process takes place only after PD. Since patients will be randomised intraoperatively, after PD, we expect nil patients’ withdrawal from treatment. Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c} To improve adherence to the intervention protocol and to reduce bias, the resection phase of PD will be performed by the surgeon without knowledge about the patient’s treatment allocation. Patients are randomised after the resection phase of PD. To improve adherence to the protocol regarding adding BE, a step-by-step manual will be given, and intraoperative photos need to be taken and sent to the coordinating investigator. In addition, protocol training will be provided to all participating centres during the study initiation visit. Relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial {11d} This trial does not include a cointervention. Perioperative care, including feeding protocols, will be performed via the centre’s own protocol. This concomitant care is permitted. Provisions for post-trial care {30} The sponsor/investigator has a liability insurance which is in accordance with article 7 of the WMO. The sponsor has an insurance which is in accordance with the legal requirements in the Netherlands (article 7 WMO). This insurance provides cover for damage to research subjects through injury or death caused by the study. The insurance applies to the damage that becomes apparent during the study or within 4 years after the end of the study. Outcomes {12} Primary outcome: delayed gastric emptying (DGE) The primary endpoint is postoperative DGE grade B/C according to the ISGPS classification. In this classification, DGE is defined by the need for maintenance of the nasogastric tube (NGT), need for reinsertion of NGT for persistent vomiting after postoperative day (POD) 7 or inability to tolerate a solid diet. DGE grade B/C are associated with delay in patients’ recovery and hospital discharge and are therefore considered as ‘clinically relevant’ DGE (Table 1 7 Table 1 Definition of clinically relevant DGE (grade B/C), ISGPS definition (Wente et al. [ 7 DGE grade Nasogastric tube required Unable to tolerate solid oral intake by POD Vomiting/gastric distension Use of prokinetics B 8–14 days or reinsertion after POD 7 14 + + C > 14 days or reinsertion after POD 14 21 + + Abbreviations: DGE POD NGT The DPCG has facilitated a national registry of all surgical complications, the DPCA. These data include all patients in the Netherlands who undergo PD. This data includes the incidence of DGE grade B/C. The data is entered by data managers of all DPCG centres. Secondary outcomes Pancreatic fistula POPF is defined, according to ISGPS, as any measurable volume of drain output with an amylase level of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal serum amylase and clinically relevant condition or development of the patient directly related to the POPF [ 15 2 Table 2 Classification and grading of POPF, ISGPS revised 2016 classification [ 17 Grade Biochemical leak (no POPF) B C Increased amylase level in drain fluid > 3 times upper limit institutional normal serum value Yes Yes Yes Persistent peripancreatic drainage > 3 weeks No Yes Yes Clinically relevant change in management of POPF a No Yes Yes POPF percutaneous or endoscopic specific interventions for collections No Yes Yes Angiographic procedures for POPF related bleeding No Yes Yes Reoperation for POPF No No Yes Signs of infection related to POPF No Yes, without organ failure Yes, with organ failure POPF related organ failure b No No Yes POPF related death No No Yes a b Anastomotic leak Anastomotic leaks of the HJ, GJ or BE are of interest. Anastomotic leaks of the HJ manifest as bile leakage. Bile leakage is defined by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS) as ‘fluid with an increased bilirubin concentration in the abdominal drain or in the intra-abdominal fluid on or after postoperative day 3, or as the need for radiologic intervention (i.e. interventional drainage) because of biliary collections or relaparotomy resulting from bile peritonitis’ (p. 684) [ 16 3 Table 3 Grading and definition of bile leakage after hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery (ISGLS) [ 16 Grade Definition A Bile leakage requiring no or little change in patients’ clinical management B Bile leakage requiring a change in patients clinical management (e.g. additional diagnostic or interventional procedures) but manageable without relaparotomy, or Grade A bile leakage lasting for > 1 week C Bile leakage requiring relaparotomy Anastomotic leaks of the GJ or BE are defined either radiographically—by contrast extravasation from the GJ or BE on abdominal computer tomography (CT) with contrast—or intraoperatively, when dehiscence of the anastomosis is observed during relaparotomy. Postoperative complications: incidence and severity Postoperative complications are scored according to the modified Clavien-Dindo classification for surgical complications (Table 4 17 Table 4 Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications (Dindo et al. [ 17 Grade Definition Grade I Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions Allowed therapeutic regimens are drugs as antiemetics, antipyretics, analgesics, diuretics, electrolytes and physiotherapy. This grade also includes wound infections opened at the bedside Grade II Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications. Blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition are also included Grade III Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention IIIa Intervention not under general anaesthesia IIIb Intervention under general anaesthesia Grade IV Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications)* requiring IC/ICU management IVa Single organ dysfunction (including dialysis) IVb Multiorgan dysfunction Grade V Death of a patient CNS IC ICU * Hospital length of stay This is the time period in days between hospital admission and discharge from the hospital. In-hospital mortality Any death during hospital admission. 30-day mortality Any death occurring within 30 days after PD. Patient-reported outcomes measurements (PROMs) PROMs will be assessed prior to pancreatic surgery and in the postoperative period. Each PROM and its evaluation in time is displayed in Table 5 Table 5 Schedule of PROMs Item Baseline (prior to surgery) 1 week postoperative 2 weeks postoperative 3 months postoperative EQ-5D X † X* X* X EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26 X † – X* X QoR-15 X † X* X* X † *  EQ-5D-5L The EQ-5D is a standardised quality of life measurement which assessed quality of life on five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, severe problems and extreme problems [ 18 19  EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26 Both the EORTC QLC-C30 and EORTC PAN26 were originally developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [ 20 21 22  QoR-15 The Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire is a questionnaire that has been extensively validated as a measure of the quality of recovery in the postoperative period, in a range of clinical settings. In addition to high validity and reliability, the questionnaire has a high complete and return rate (97%) [ 23 24 Functional outcome at 12 months At 12 months after the surgery, patients will be phoned to assess whether they have complaints of delayed gastric emptying (‘afferent loop syndrome’) and to fill out the EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26. In this study, patients will be specifically questioned regarding the presence, frequency and severity of the following symptoms: postprandial midabdominal discomfort, postprandial nausea, burning epigastric pain aggravated by meals, unintended weight loss, food aversion, symptoms suggestive of malabsorption (e.g. steatorrhea or diarrhoea) and projectile bilious vomiting. These questions aim to capture both the typical and more subtle clinical manifestations of chronic afferent loop syndrome [ 25 Costs During the trial, costs will be assessed from a health care perspective, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)—based on EQ-5D-5L utilities combined with survival—will be measured per patient over a 1-year period. The design of the economic evaluation follows the principles of a cost-utility analysis and adheres to the Dutch guideline for performing economic evaluations in health care [ 26 The cost analysis exists of two main parts. First, at the patient level, volumes of care will be measured prospectively using data from the DPCA, which includes our primary and secondary outcomes. The DPCA data indicates the health care consumption per patient of both control and experimental study group. The most relevant healthcare components expected to differ between groups include prolonged hospital stay, diagnostic imaging, radiological or endoscopic interventions (e.g. percutaneous drainage or feeding tube placement), relaparotomy, intensive care unit (ICU) admittance and hospital readmission. Second, standard unit costs will be applied to each component of care. These will be based on the reference prices listed in the costing manual accompanying the Dutch guideline for economic evaluations in health care, adjusted to 2024 euros [ 26 Participant timeline {13} See Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Template of content for the schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments. Abbreviations: t 1 2 3 x Sample size {14} The REMBRANDT trial is a superiority trial as the hypothesis is that adding BE to PD results in a lower rate of postoperative DGE than the standard Child procedure. Based on a meta-analysis by Zhou et al., the pooled incidence of DGE grade B/C in PD with Child procedure is 22% and for PD with Child procedure and BE 8% [ 13 5 Recruitment {15} In the Netherlands, there are currently 15 hospitals performing pancreatic surgery. These hospitals vary in the average number of PDs, with a minimum volume norm of 20 PDs annually. We estimate that per month 60 patients in the Netherlands undergo PD spread over these 15 expert centres. Of these 60 PDs, approximately 20 will be performed robotically. Since the REMBRANDT trial only includes patients with open PD, this would lead to 40 eligible patients per month. Twelve DPCG expert centres have agreed to participate. The expected number of inclusions varies per centre. We estimate that ¾ of all patients agree to participate. This brings us to an accrual rate of 18 patients per month. Assignment of interventions: allocation Sequence generation {16a} The REMBRANDT trial is a multicentre randomised-controlled trial. We perform individual randomisation. This means that each hospital randomises an equal number of patients in the control group as well as the intervention group (1:1). Hereby, we also warrant an equal distribution of confounders, such as perioperative dietary protocols and slight variations in Child reconstruction techniques. These may differ between hospitals and may influence the incidence of DGE. Therefore, individual randomisation 1:1 per participating hospital is required. Randomisation will be performed intraoperatively. This means that when the resection phase of PD has been performed the patient is randomised to either the S-Child group or the BE-Child group with a 1:1 allocation after inclusion by coordinating investigator through a computer-generated randomisation (Castor EDC, Amsterdam). Reason to randomise intraoperatively is that only patients who actually undergo PD will be randomised and that patients who cannot undergo PD, because of unexpected findings during surgery, are not. Concealment mechanism {16b} Patients will be randomised intraoperatively by the coordinating investigator through a computer-generated randomisation program (Castor EDC, Amsterdam). The performing surgeon will call the coordinating investigator to determine the allocation and perform the assigned intervention. Implementation {16c} Eligible patients will be identified at the outpatient clinic of the surgeon. Patients will be informed about the goals of the study, its risks and benefits after which informed consent will be obtained. The intervention will be assigned by the coordinating investigator through a randomisation program (Castor EDC, Amsterdam). Assignment of interventions: blinding Who will be blinded {17a} Patients will be blinded considering their treatment allocation. The house officer, ward nurses and data managers who extract data concerning the primary and secondary endpoints will be blinded for the allocation as well. With respect to the documentation of Braun enteroenterostomy and the maintenance of blinding, the operative reports will only indicate that the patient is participating in the trial without mentioning the group allocation. For this reason, this will be a patient-and-observer blinded randomised controlled trial. Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b} In case patients develop postoperative complications that require an abdominal CT scan or an endoscopy, unblinding will be inevitable. Data collection and management Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a} Baseline characteristics of patients who have provided informed consent will be recorded prior to randomisation. Most outcomes of interest will be collected using the DPCA database, where standardised case report forms are used to register outcomes at a national level. The DPCA does not collect data concerning the questionnaires, EQ-5D, EORTC QLQ-C30/PAN26 and QoR-15. For this reason, these data will be collected separately during the study period. Prior to statistical analysis, DPCA data will be cross-checked with data from the primary source for maximum quality control. Additionally, for outcomes not recorded in the DPCA, electronic patient records will be reviewed. The primary outcome will also be independently assessed by the study team for quality assurance. Patient records will be monitored throughout the entire 12-month follow-up period. Plans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up {18b} Promotion of patient participation will be executed through newsletters and/or the website of the patient association of pancreatic cancer (Living with Hope). Patients who have enrolled the study are at liberty to withdraw from study participation at any moment. Participants that have withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. Participants who wish to dropout the study in follow-up will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principles. Data management {19} The data will be stored digitally and will be kept by the project leader for 15 years after the inclusion of the last patient. A web-based encrypted data management system will be used to minimise errors, to ensure traceability and privacy of the subjects. Subjects will be coded by a numeric code in order to create a pseudonymised dataset. A Castor database will be developed and used for data management. Investigators have access to this code and will store the subject identification code list at a separate location from the dataset. To monitor quality of data, the DPCA data will be cross-checked with the source data. In case data is missing in the DPCA, the source data can also be used to relieve the missing data. Confidentiality {27} Personal information about enrolled participants will be collected and shared with the coordinating investigator after informed consent is signed. Since this is a registry-based study, personal information will be collected through the DPCA. Additional information will be collected through the local investigator. Data will be securely stored in the database of the department of surgery of the Radboud University Medical Centre accessible to the investigators, in accordance with the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act (AVG) and the Medical Treatment Agreement Act (WGBO). Plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in this trial/future use {33} Not applicable since no laboratory tests will be performed and no biological specimens will be collected. Statistical methods Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a} Baseline characteristics for the patient groups and the outcomes of interest will be reported as means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables and as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for non-normally distributed continuous variables. The distribution of continuous variables will be assessed using graphical methods (boxplots, Q-Q plots and histograms) and statistical tests (Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Shapiro–Wilk and Levene’s tests). Comparisons between groups will be made using independent samples t U Categorical variables, including the primary outcome (DGE) and secondary outcomes such as POPF, will be reported as absolute numbers and percentages. Group comparisons will be conducted using chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate. Two-sided p The primary outcome will be compared between groups by calculating both the risk difference (RD) and relative risks (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), based on the intention-to-treat principle. A per-protocol analysis will also be conducted to assess the effect of the intervention based on the treatment actually received. To identify patient-level risk factors for DGE, a multivariable logistic regression analysis will be performed, providing adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for each covariate. Additionally, a multilevel analysis will be conducted to account for the stratified randomisation at hospital level and potential clustering of outcomes within centres. All statistical analyses will be performed in collaboration with the study statistician. Interim analyses {21b} Not applicable. No interim analyses will be conducted, as the safety of the intervention has already been established. We believe interim analysis will not add additional benefit in terms of patient safety. Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b} To assess whether the effect of the intervention differs across clinically relevant subgroups, predefined subgroup analyses will be conducted using multivariable logistic regression models with interaction terms. Subgroups of interest include: Underlying diagnosis (e.g. PDAC, IPMN, other) Type of resection (PPPD vs. PRPD) ASA classification (I-II vs. III-IV) Given the stratified randomisation per participating centre, all models will be adjusted for hospital-level clustering using multilevel modelling techniques. Results will be reported as odds ratios with 95% CIs, and interaction p Methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c} In case of missing data, we will first attempt to retrieve the information from the electronic medical record. If data remain missing, multiple imputation using chained equations (MICE) will be performed. Since the intervention (BE) is performed intraoperatively, there is no possibility for patients to non-adhere to the allocated treatment arm. However, if for some reason, patients do not receive BE whilst being randomised to the intervention group, they will be analysed in their originally allocated group in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. Longitudinal analyses of PROMs will be performed using appropriate repeated measures models, accounting for within-patient correlation over time. Plans to give access to the full protocol, participant-level data and statistical code {31c} The study protocol can be viewed via ClinicalTrials.gov. Oversight and monitoring Composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee {5d} At the coordinating centre, a PhD candidate is in charge of running the trial on a daily basis. This individual is under the supervision of two principal investigators. Weekly evaluations of the trial take place, and additional consultations with the supervisors are available throughout the week. Potential trial participants are identified and discussed during multidisciplinary team meetings held on a weekly basis. At all participating centres, the local principal investigators (surgeons) are accountable for on-site logistics. The Trial Steering Committee comprises members of the DPCG. This committee receives regular updates on the trial’s progress during quarterly meetings. Supplementary updates are provided upon request. Data management is facilitated by the data managers from the coordinating centre and the Radboudumc Technology Centre for Clinical Studies. Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure {21a} A data monitoring committee (DMC) was not deemed necessary for the REMBRANDT trial, as the study does not involve novel or experimental interventions. Instead, it implements best practices derived from current literature and guidelines at both patient and surgical levels. Furthermore, the trial is classified as a low-risk study by the medical ethics committee within the Netherlands, as previous studies have demonstrated the safety of Braun anastomosis. Therefore, routine safety monitoring by a DMC was not needed. Adverse event reporting and harms {22} Adverse events (AE) are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during the study, regardless of whether it is considered related to investigational treatment. All AEs reported spontaneously by the subject, or observed by the investigator or their staff, will be recorded. All AEs will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow-up may require additional tests or medical procedures as indicated and/or referral to the general physician or a medical specialist. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect at any dose: Results in death Is life-threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event) Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatient hospitalisation Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity Is a new event of the trial likely to affect the safety of other subjects Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require hospitalisation may still be considered a serious adverse event when, based on appropriate medical judgement, the event may jeopardise the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above An elective hospital admission will not be considered a SAE. The investigator will report all SAEs resulting in death or disability to the sponsor without undue delay after obtaining knowledge of the events. The sponsor will report the SAEs through the web portal ‘ToetsingOnline’ to the accredited Medical Ethics Committee (MEC) that approved the protocol, within 7 days of first knowledge for SAEs that result in death, are life-threatening or are directly related to the investigational treatment, followed by a maximum of 8 days to complete the initial preliminary report. All other SAEs, including those directly related to the standard surgical procedure or underlying diagnoses, will be registered and reported once a year in an annual safety report. SAEs considered directly related to surgery: Delayed gastric emptying Pancreatic fistula Anastomotic leak Wound infection Rebleeding Abscess formation Urinary tract infection Pneumonia SAEs considered directly related to underlying diagnoses: Hospitalisation or death in the period from 4 weeks up to 12 months after surgery due to underlying diagnoses SAEs need to be reported until the end of the study in the Netherlands, as defined in the protocol. All SAEs will be managed in accordance with locally applicable and nationwide clinical guidelines and protocols. Where relevant, treatment will follow the recommendations of the pancreatic cancer guideline [ 27 Frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23} At any given point during the study, the trial can be selected for audit. There is no predefined schedule for audits and inspections. Plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical committees) {25} Amendments are changes made to the research after a favourable opinion by the accredited MEC has been given. All amendments will be notified to the MEC that gave a favourable opinion. Non-substantial amendments will not be notified to the accredited MEC and the competent authority but will be recorded and filed by the sponsor. The investigator will submit a summary of the progress of the trial to the accredited MEC once a year. Information will be provided on the date of inclusion of the first subject, numbers of subjects included and numbers of subjects that have completed the trial, serious adverse events/serious adverse reactions, other problems and amendments. Dissemination plans {31a} The results of the REMBRANDT trial will be fully disclosed through publication in peer-reviewed journals and through presentations at national and international scientific conferences. Results will also be shared with participants through the DPCG and Living with Hope newsletters. Discussion The REMBRANDT trial aims to assess the efficacy of adding the Braun anastomosis into the conventional Child reconstruction for patients undergoing open pancreatoduodenectomy, with a focus on its impact on delayed gastric emptying. Throughout the study’s design, various points of discussion arose, including:  Exclusivity of open procedure vs. robotic approach The decision to exclusively focus on open PD and not include a robotic approach in the trial is rooted in several factors. Firstly, the existing evidence supporting the efficacy of the Braun anastomosis in reducing DGE was found in studies assessing its efficacy in open procedures. Secondly, at the time of trial design, surgeons generally had less experience with robotic PD compared to the open approach. The robotic Whipple procedure is not (yet) fully embedded in the Dutch clinical practice. Moreover, the evolving nature of robotic surgery in this specific context may introduce additional variables and challenges that could potentially confound the trial results. By opting for an exclusive focus on open procedures, this trial seeks to minimise potential confounding factors related to surgical expertise. Timing of randomisation The timing of randomisation represents a critical aspect of the study design. In this trial, intraoperative randomisation has been chosen for specific considerations. Intraoperative randomisation is used to mitigate the risk of including patients with metastatic disease who will not undergo surgery. This approach enhances the internal validity of the trial by minimising the influence of preexisting factors that could impact outcomes. Additionally, intraoperative randomisation allows for the exclusion of patients for whom the surgical procedure is deemed unsafe or impractical during the operation. This consideration reflects the commitment to patient safety and ethical standards, ensuring that only eligible and appropriate candidates are included in the randomised groups. Furthermore, we will report the reasons for patient dropout from the study to provide transparency and better understand the factors contributing to their exclusion. Patients who are not randomised are systematically replaced in the study, maintaining the integrity of the randomised design. Furthermore, patients are randomised after pancreatic head resection and before reconstruction of the GJ, HJ and PJ. Only after resection, the patient is randomised and either receives an additional BE or not during reconstruction. This allows for a more equal comparison between the study arms. Standardisation of reconstruction techniques The decision not to standardise the reconstruction technique in this trial stems from the inherent variability observed across different hospitals in PD reconstruction technique. Consequently, to preserve the generalisability and applicability of the study outcomes across all participating centres, the choice was made to refrain from predefining a standardised reconstruction approach. The pathophysiology of DGE is not completely understood and is considered to be multifactorial, involving surgical technique, perioperative care and feeding strategies. Standardising only one of these components would not fully address these complexities and might provide a false sense of control over internal validity. Furthermore, enforcing a uniform surgical approach across all participating centres would be impractical and potentially counterproductive. Surgeons deviating from their established routines may encounter unforeseen complications, which could compromise patient safety and study outcomes. Although all participating surgeons are highly experienced in PD and in performing BE, we acknowledge that heterogeneity in surgical technique and surgeon-dependent factors may introduce variability. To address this, the application of the BE is uniformly standardised across all centres according to detailed protocol, whilst allowing flexibility in the broader reconstruction technique to reflect real-world practice. To control for this heterogeneity, we have adopted a stratification approach based on participating centres. This enables a more nuanced analysis that accounts for centre-level variation. Additionally, the statistical analysis plan includes adjustment for potential confounding arising from inter-centre variability. By doing so, the trial aims to isolate the effect of the BE within each institutional context, thereby enhancing the external validity of the findings. Nonetheless, we recognise that residual confounding from surgeon- or centre-specific practices cannot be fully excluded, even after stratification and statistical adjustment. This is an inherent aspect of conducting pragmatic multicentre trials and will be carefully considered in the interpretation of results. Standardisation of perioperative care, including feeding protocols Perioperative care, including feeding protocols, is not standardised in this trial. This will be performed according to the individual centre’s protocols. Reason for not standardising this is both a pragmatic choice and a way to simplify implementation of the intervention after proven effective. These differences will be accounted for in the final analysis of the results. Inclusion of all indications for pancreatoduodenectomy In this study, we chose to include all indications for PD, encompassing both malignant and premalignant conditions such as PDAC, IPMN, NET and other periampullary neoplasms. This approach enhances the generalisability of our findings, as PD is performed for a wide spectrum of indications in routine clinical practice. By not limiting inclusion to patients with PDAC, the study reflects real-world surgical populations and allows broader applicability of the result to daily care. Furthermore, the intervention under investigation—intended to prevent DGE—is not disease-specific but targets a postoperative complication influenced by anatomical and technical factors that may occur regardless of the underlying diagnosis. However, we acknowledge that this approach introduces clinical heterogeneity. Patients undergoing PD for PDAC, especially in borderline resectable or locally advanced stages, often require extended resections. These more extensive procedures may independently increase the risk of DGE, potential confounding the association between BE and DGE. To address this, we have incorporated a predefined subgroup analysis comparing PDAC vs. non-PDAC pathology. Whilst these subgroup analyses may be limited by sample size, they will provide exploratory insights into whether the effect of the BE varies across clinical subgroups. Nevertheless, this heterogeneity remains an important limitation and the results should be interpreted accordingly. In case the addition of BE is effective in reducing DGE, the BE will be nationally implemented via a three-step dissemination and implementation strategy. These consists of: Barrier and facilitator analysis based on interviews We have already conducted several interviews with surgeons regarding the implementation of BE and will proceed with an in-depth analysis of barriers and facilitators through additional semi-structured interviews with 15 pancreatic surgeons in the Netherlands (one pancreatic surgeon per centre). In this barrier and facilitator analysis, the framework of Grol and Wensing will be used [ 28 Monitoring BE via DPCA The addition of BE will be added to the national audit for pancreatic surgery in the Netherlands. This way it becomes clear to which extent BE is implemented on a national level. It enables monitoring and further steering via data presentations in the quarterly DPCG meetings. Follow-up plans for further implementation can be constructed based on these meetings. Audits per centre on the use of BE The DPCG has regular, multidisciplinary meetings concerning the developments in the field of pancreatic cancer. These meeting will be used to present the use and implementation of BE on a national level. Trial status Protocol version 7, December 1, 2023.
