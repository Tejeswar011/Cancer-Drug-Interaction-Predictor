See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological malignancy in high-income countries, with incidence rates rising globally. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for improving outcomes. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) remains a cost-effective first-line tool, and emerging techniques such as three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US), contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), elastography, and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced imaging may further improve diagnostic performance. AIM To systematically review recent advances in US-based imaging techniques for the diagnosis and staging of EC, and to compare their performance with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed to identify studies published between January 2010 and March 2025. Eligible studies evaluated TVUS, 3D-US, CEUS, elastography, or AI-enhanced US in EC diagnosis and staging. Methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were extracted where available, with narrative synthesis due to heterogeneity. RESULTS Forty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. TVUS demonstrated high sensitivity (76%–96%) but moderate specificity (61%–86%), while MRI achieved higher specificity (84%–95%) and superior staging accuracy. 3D-US yielded accuracy comparable to MRI in selected early-stage cases. CEUS and elastography enhanced tissue characterization, and AI-enhanced US achieved pooled AUCs up to 0.91 for risk prediction and lesion segmentation. Variability in performance was noted across modalities due to patient demographics, equipment differences, and operator experience. CONCLUSION TVUS remains a highly sensitive initial screening tool, with MRI preferred for definitive staging. 3D-US, CEUS, elastography, and AI-enhanced techniques show promise as complementary or alternative approaches, particularly in low-resource settings. Standardization, multicenter validation, and integration of multi-modal imaging are needed to optimize diagnostic pathways for EC.

It currently stands as the most prevalent gynecological malignancy in high-income nations[ 1 2 Fortunately, most EC cases are detected at an early stage—approximately 80% are diagnosed at stage I—where the prognosis is excellent, with 5-year survival rates exceeding 95%. In contrast, the outlook worsens significantly when the disease progresses beyond the uterus, with survival dropping to 68% in cases of regional spread and just 17% when distant metastases are present[ 3 In 2020 alone, 417367 new cases of EC were reported worldwide, with North America and Western Europe bearing the highest burden[ 4 5 6 4 The incidence and outcomes of EC show significant geographic, socioeconomic, and racial disparities. The disease is notably more common in high-income nations, potentially due to varying healthcare access and differences in specialist availability[ 7 8 9 Genetic variations in tumors also significantly influence EC outcomes. Type II EC in Black women commonly features genetic mutations in TP53 PIK3R1 10 Ethnic disparities are evident among Asian women, who are diagnosed at a younger average age (around 58.4 years) compared to White women (approximately 65.1 years). Asian women are also more likely to present with advanced-stage disease. Among Asian Americans, United States-born women have higher rates of type I EC compared to immigrant counterparts[ 11 Risk factors Numerous risk factors influence the development of EC. These include increasing age, higher body mass index (BMI), certain ethnic backgrounds, prolonged exposure to estrogen (either endogenous or through hormone therapies), tamoxifen use, early onset of menstruation, late menopause, low parity, metabolic syndrome, and a family history of cancer or known genetic predispositions. Protective factors include maintaining a normal BMI, having more children, and using oral contraceptives[ 12 12 Pathology and subtypes Endometrial carcinoma is primarily categorized into two main subtypes: Type I and type II, with the vast majority being adenocarcinomas[ 13 14 PTEN 13 14 via p53 13 14 Histological variants Type I tumors are most commonly represented by endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for approximately 85% of cases[ 13 13 Clinical presentation Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is the most frequent symptom, prompting about two-thirds of gynecological consultations among peri-menopausal and post-menopausal women. Nearly 90% of EC patients report PMB, although it results in a cancer diagnosis in only 9% of cases[ 15 e.g. 12 Importance of early detection Timely and accurate diagnosis is vital in improving survival outcomes for individuals with EC. The five-year survival rate exceeds 95% when the disease is caught early but plummets to around 15% once it has spread beyond the uterus. This stark contrast underscores the critical need for public awareness of early symptoms, accessible and equitable healthcare, and systematic early screening and diagnosis, especially in high-risk populations. Early intervention not only improves outcomes but also significantly reduces the physical and emotional burden of advanced disease[ 3 Role of imaging in EC diagnosis Imaging is a cornerstone in the diagnosis, staging, and management of EC. Among the available modalities, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is frequently used due to its accessibility, affordability, and non-invasive nature, particularly as an initial diagnostic step. Ultrasound: A key diagnostic tool TVUS is typically the first-line imaging method, especially in women presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding, a hallmark symptom of EC. It provides valuable information on endometrial thickness (a key diagnostic marker), echotexture, and vascular patterns[ 16 17 In postmenopausal women, an endometrial thickness over 5 mm is often considered abnormal when measured in the sagittal plane. This threshold yields a sensitivity of approximately 96% and specificity of about 61% for detecting EC[ 16 16 Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) enhances visualization of tumor vascularity, helping detect features like deep myometrial invasion and cervical stromal involvement, both critical for accurate staging[ 18 When standard TVUS is inconclusive, sono-hysterography may be performed. This involves instilling sterile saline into the uterine cavity to expand and better visualize the endometrial lining, offering improved detail with the ultrasound (US) probe[ 18 Magnetic resonance imaging: The gold standard for local staging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the most accurate tool for local staging of EC due to its superior soft tissue contrast. It plays a pivotal role in assessing depth of myometrial invasion, cervical stromal involvement, and tumor extension into surrounding tissues[ 19 21 21 Computed tomography: For distant disease assessment While computed tomography (CT) is not ideal for initial diagnosis or precise local staging, it is useful for detecting distant metastases, including to the lungs or abdomen. On contrast-enhanced CT, EC may appear as diffuse thickening of the endometrium and a hypoenhancing mass within the uterine cavity. However, CT struggles to differentiate early-stage EC from normal tissue, particularly on non-contrast scans[ 22 Nuclear medicine: Positron emission tomography-CT Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT has limited utility in evaluating primary tumors due to physiological uptake in the uterus, particularly in premenopausal women. It is less effective than MRI or US for primary diagnosis but may assist in evaluating metastatic spread in advanced or recurrent cases[ 23 Integration of artificial intelligence in radiology In recent years, technological innovations—including three-dimensional (3D) US, CEUS, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostic tools—have expanded the capabilities of imaging. The integration of AI into radiology is rapidly reshaping the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, streamlining workflows, and improving patient care outcomes. AI, particularly through machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques, is being applied to a wide range of imaging tasks, including lesion detection, image segmentation, and pattern recognition. These technologies enable radiologists to interpret images more efficiently, reduce diagnostic errors, and prioritize critical cases for immediate review. AI algorithms can analyze complex imaging features beyond human perception, allowing for earlier identification of subtle pathological changes. In addition to diagnostic applications, AI contributes significantly to predictive analytics, using imaging and clinical data to forecast disease progression and treatment response[ 24 The aim of this study is to explore and critically review the development of US imaging techniques, from basic two-dimensional (2D) scans to more recent AI-assisted approaches, in the diagnosis of EC. MATERIALS AND METHODS To ensure methodological rigor and transparency, this review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic literature search was conducted using four electronic databases: (1) PubMed; (2) Scopus; (3) Web of Science; and (4) Google Scholar. The search covered studies published between January 2010 and March 2025. Search terms included combinations of \"endometrial cancer\", \"transvaginal ultrasound\", \"3D ultrasound\", \"contrast-enhanced ultrasound\", \"elastography\", \"artificial intelligence\", \"radiomics\", and \"deep learning\". Studies were included if they involved original research evaluating US or AI-based imaging for the diagnosis of EC, were published in English, and involved human subjects. Studies such as editorials, letters, animal studies, and case reports with fewer than five participants were excluded. The study selection process is illustrated in a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1 Figure 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Diagram. In order to appraise the methodological quality and risk of bias in the included studies, the QUADAS-2 tool was applied to each imaging modality, including TVUS, 3D-US, CEUS, elastography, and AI-based methods. The assessment covered domains such as patient selection, index test quality, reference standard, and timing of assessments. The results of this evaluation are summarized in the Results section and detailed further in a supplementary appendix. Statistical analysis Where data allowed, we extracted and synthesized sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. Although a formal meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity in study designs, sample populations, and imaging protocols, we provide a quantitative synthesis where appropriate. A comparative summary table was developed to display pooled or median diagnostic performance for each modality, along with their primary indications, clinical strengths, and limitations. Variability in results arising from factors such as patient demographics, imaging equipment, and operator experience is discussed to contextualize the findings. RESULTS Study quality and diagnostic performance A total of 41 studies were included in this systematic review after screening and eligibility assessment across the four databases. We conducted a quality appraisal of these studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. The majority demonstrated low risk of bias across key domains including patient selection, index test conduct, reference standard quality, and timing. However, studies focusing on emerging modalities, particularly elastography and AI-enhanced US, showed variable methodological rigor. Specific concerns included incomplete reference standard description and lack of external validation. The full assessment is presented in Table 1 24 38 Table 1 QUADAS-2 quality assessment  Ref.

Quantitative synthesis and comparative analysis The diagnostic performance of each imaging modality was synthesized from eligible studies. TVUS exhibited high sensitivity (76%–96%) for initial screening but showed moderate to variable specificity (61%–86%), particularly in postmenopausal and obese populations. MRI provided superior specificity (84%–95%) and was particularly effective in assessing myometrial invasion and cervical stromal extension, and staging of type II tumors. Its diagnostic accuracy was consistently higher for deep invasion and advanced-stage disease. 3D-US demonstrated diagnostic accuracy approaching that of MRI in carefully selected early-stage patients, especially when combined with volumetric assessments. CEUS and shear wave elastography (SWE) provided additional tissue-level insights, particularly for vascularity and stiffness, with AUC values ranging between 0.85 and 0.88. AI-enhanced US models, incorporating radiomics or deep learning, demonstrated promising results with pooled AUCs as high as 0.91, particularly in risk prediction and lesion segmentation tasks.

Substantial heterogeneity was observed across the studies. Variations in patient demographics ( e.g. vs DISCUSSION 2D-US  Basic principles and usage: et al 24 25  Limitations in EC diagnosis: et al 24 25 TVUS  Diagnostic value and sensitivity: 26  Standard measurement parameters: 39 Doppler US  Assessment of vascularity: 40  Clinical significance of resistance and pulsatility indices: 27 3D-US With its superior spatial resolution and accurate volumetric and morphological evaluations over 2D-US, 3D-TVUS is becoming increasingly useful in gynecologic oncology. According to Xydias et al 28 In diagnosing endometrial carcinoma, Xydias et al 28 29 With instruments like VOCAL, 3D-US enables comprehensive volumetric analysis, increasing measurement consistency and accuracy. Additionally, it allows precise morphological evaluation, crucial for surgical planning and staging[ 29 Overall, 3D-US is a viable first-line method for evaluating EC, as it improves diagnostic accuracy and is non-invasive, repeatable, and economical. Its clinical application needs further standardization through additional research[ 28 29 CEUS By employing microbubble contrast agents, CEUS enhances the visibility of uterine vascular systems, providing real-time microvasculature imaging often undetectable by traditional ultrasonography. CEUS improves blood flow evaluation in uterine tissues. Normal enhancement progresses sequentially from the uterine artery to the myometrium and endometrium. Conversely, malignant lesions exhibit uneven, disordered, and hypervascular patterns, whereas benign lesions like fibroids present distinct vascular rims or \"pseudocapsules\". Benign lesions usually have clear borders and a gradual, homogeneous enhancement. Malignant tumors, characterized by aberrant angiogenesis, develop rapidly and unevenly. Compared to traditional US, CEUS demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy, particularly in detecting leiomyosarcomas and staging EC[ 30 Thus, CEUS is promising for assessing uterine vascularity and differentiating between benign and malignant diseases, warranting further clinical integration[ 30 Elastography Elastography, an advanced US technique, evaluates tissue stiffness via et al 30 31 ML and pattern recognition ML significantly impacts US-based illness identification. Zheng et al 31 32 However, ML faces challenges. Mohit et al 32 33 Overall, ML models exhibit potential for distinguishing benign and malignant tumors, contingent on standardizing methods and ensuring robust feature extraction[ 32 33 Deep learning and neural networks Deep learning demonstrates significant potential in US imaging for segmentation and diagnosis automation. Song et al 33 34 Wu et al 34 35 Thus, deep learning models exhibit high performance in segmentation and classification tasks, enhancing diagnostic precision and reducing human error in clinical practice[ 34 35 Real-time AI-assisted US AI integration into real-time US holds significant bedside diagnostic potential. Nathani et al 35 36 Bajaj et al 36 37 Integrating AI into real-time US enhances diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and operator confidence, requiring further validation across diverse scenarios for widespread adoption[ 36 37 Comparative analysis and clinical implications  Diagnostic accuracy across modalities: 38 38 MRI remains unequivocally superior in several critical contexts. It provides more reliable assessment of cervical stromal invasion, which is essential for accurate FIGO staging and surgical planning[ 19 20 21 22 Although AI-enhanced US shows promise in expanding the diagnostic capabilities of TVUS through automation and radiomic pattern recognition, it cannot yet match MRI’s multi-parametric imaging or soft-tissue contrast resolution. That said, in low-resource settings, AI-augmented US represents a compelling alternative where MRI is not accessible. US units are more affordable, portable, and logistically feasible in rural or underserved healthcare systems. The combination of 3D-US, CEUS, and ML algorithms could offer a cost-effective staging tool in these environments, provided that its implementation is standardized and validated[ 30 38 41 In summary, while TVUS and AI-enhanced US are invaluable for initial screening and triage, MRI remains irreplaceable for definitive local staging, evaluating high-risk features, and planning individualized surgical approaches. A tiered diagnostic strategy, starting with US and escalating to MRI for ambiguous or high-risk cases, optimizes both resource allocation and clinical accuracy[ 38 Advantages and limitations of each approach TVUS is commended for being easily accessible, inexpensive, and non-ionizing, which makes it ideal for preliminary testing, especially in resource-limited environments. However, inter-observer variability might affect its dependability, and its accuracy is greatly dependent on the operator[ 38 Radiomics extracts hidden information from US images to provide a quantitative and repeatable assessment of imaging data. Current drawbacks include technological complexity, dependence on high-quality image capture, and lack of standardized protocols, potentially hindering daily clinical integration[ 41 Clinical decision-making and patient outcomes It is crucial to highlight the critical role of imaging in guiding surgical planning. Accurate assessment of MI determines the need for procedures like lymphadenectomy, directly influencing morbidity and survival outcomes. A sequential diagnostic strategy is emphasized using TVUS initially and reserving MRI for ambiguous or high-risk cases[ 38 41 Subtype-specific imaging considerations The distinction between type I and type II EC subtypes has important implications for imaging strategy and clinical management. Type I EC, typically endometrioid in histology, is generally well-differentiated and estrogen-dependent, with a favorable prognosis and 5-year survival rates exceeding 85%–90% when diagnosed early. In contrast, type II EC, which includes serous, clear cell, and other high-grade subtypes, is associated with aggressive behavior, deep myometrial invasion, and a 5-year survival rate often below 50%. These tumors are frequently p53-mutated and may also exhibit HER2 overexpression, making them biologically and radiologically distinct. From an imaging standpoint, MRI is the modality of choice for assessing type II EC, as it provides superior soft-tissue resolution critical for evaluating deep myometrial and cervical stromal invasion, lymphovascular space involvement, and adnexal spread. While US techniques, including 3D and Doppler-enhanced TVUS, can detect endometrial abnormalities, their accuracy diminishes in advanced or atypical histologies. Type II tumors often present with a flat or indistinct morphology and minimal endometrial thickening, making them more challenging to detect with US alone. Furthermore, the integration of radiomic and AI tools holds promise in identifying high-risk molecular features, such as p53 mutation status or non-endometrioid histology, through advanced pattern recognition in imaging data. This could support non-invasive risk stratification and guide the selection of appropriate surgical or adjuvant therapies. Future directions  Personalized medicine and predictive modeling:  Multi-modal imaging integration (MRI/CT + US + AI):  Regulatory, ethical, and implementation challenges in AI:  Clinical translation and real-world implementation: In addition, the regulatory landscape for medical AI remains in flux. AI tools intended for diagnostic support must undergo rigorous evaluation and approval processes by bodies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration or European CE marking authorities. These evaluations require evidence of safety, reproducibility, and clinical utility, which many academic or prototype models still lack. Moreover, data privacy regulations ( e.g. Nonetheless, several AI-assisted US features are approaching clinical readiness. These include automated measurement of endometrial volume, segmentation of tumor boundaries, and predictive risk scoring using radiomic features. In high-resource centers, such tools may improve reporting consistency and efficiency. In low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), they hold particular promise as triage tools for early detection in environments with limited radiological expertise or MRI access. Importantly, addressing health equity is vital to ensuring that these innovations do not widen disparities. MRI remains inaccessible in many low-resource settings due to high costs and logistical limitations. AI-enhanced, portable US platforms offer a feasible and scalable alternative, especially if embedded with cloud-based decision support. Ensuring diverse, representative training datasets and involving local clinical stakeholders in tool design will be essential for closing diagnostic gaps across populations.  Optimizing multi-modal imaging integration: TVUS remains the ideal first-line modality for initial evaluation, especially in patients presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding. Its affordability, accessibility, and real-time imaging make it particularly suitable for early triage and screening, especially in primary care or low-resource environments. 3D-US and Doppler imaging can further characterize endometrial morphology and vascularity, enhancing diagnostic confidence when available. MRI should be reserved for intermediate- or high-risk cases, particularly when TVUS suggests structural distortion, myometrial invasion, or possible type II histology. MRI’s superior tissue contrast allows for precise evaluation of depth of invasion, cervical stromal involvement, and nodal architecture, all of which critically influence surgical planning. CT, although limited by poor soft tissue resolution, retains value in detecting distant metastases, particularly to the lungs or omentum. When MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, CT may serve as a fallback for broad staging—though its limitations in differentiating between uterine layers must be acknowledged. These limitations could be mitigated by combining CT with radiomics or AI-based enhancement algorithms that can improve contrast differentiation in post-processing phases. An effective hybrid diagnostic pathway could thus proceed as follows: (1) TVUS for initial screening; (2) MRI for local staging and surgical planning; and (3) CT or PET-CT for distant metastasis evaluation if advanced disease is suspected. In resource-limited settings, this sequence may be adapted by using AI-enhanced US as a surrogate for MRI, provided that validation standards are met. The integration of AI models across this diagnostic chain could offer real-time risk stratification, lesion segmentation, and clinical decision support, helping to streamline referrals and reduce diagnostic delays. Ultimately, building algorithm-based imaging workflows, tailored to institutional resources and patient risk profiles, will be key to maximizing diagnostic efficiency and outcome-driven care in EC. Limitations This review acknowledges several limitations across technological, algorithmic, and methodological domains. Technological limitations are evident in US-based approaches. TVUS and elastography techniques are highly operator-dependent, with inter-observer variability in endometrial thickness measurements reported to reach up to 20%. Visualization challenges also exist in patients with obesity, where abdominal wall fat reduces image quality, and in those with a retroverted uterus, fibroids, or adenomyosis, all of which can obscure or distort anatomical structures. For instance, fibroids are present in up to 70% of women by age 50, potentially leading to false negatives or positives. Furthermore, CEUS is limited by contraindications such as renal impairment and known hypersensitivity to contrast agents, which are often underreported in current literature. AI introduces its own set of constraints. Deep learning models, particularly CNNs, are often criticized for their lack of interpretability, the so-called \"black box\" problem, which can hinder clinical trust and adoption. Additionally, many AI algorithms have been trained on datasets from high-income regions, raising concerns about generalizability to LMICs where demographics, disease patterns, and imaging equipment may differ. Real-time AI applications further require high-performance US hardware, posing barriers to implementation in resource-limited settings. Most AI models cited in this review also lack robust external validation across diverse clinical environments. Methodologically, this review may be affected by potential publication bias, as studies with positive findings are more likely to be published and included. There is also a lack of standardization in study protocols across the literature, including differences in imaging acquisition, interpretation criteria, and outcome definitions. Despite adherence to the PRISMA guidelines, limitations in database coverage and language restriction to English may have excluded relevant studies, potentially narrowing the comprehensiveness of the evidence base. CONCLUSION Leveraging advanced US techniques and computational models to enhance diagnostic precision in EC is becoming pivotal in gynecologic oncology. TVUS and MRI show comparable diagnostic value, while radiomics-enhanced US models provide new avenues for risk prediction and personalized care. Future directions will likely focus on integrating AI and multi-modal imaging while addressing ethical and implementation challenges to ensure equitable and effective patient care.
