Introduction Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infections worldwide and pose a significant health burden. Global incidence of UTI has been rising, with billions of cases annually and substantial associated morbidity [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 5 Older adults in the ED represent a vulnerable subgroup of UTI patients with heightened risks and poorer outcomes. Over 60% of ED patients with complicated UTI are aged 65 years or older [ 5 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Timely recognition of older UTI patients at risk for clinical decline and poor outcomes is essential for guiding management decisions—including need for hospitalization, intensive monitoring, or early aggressive therapies—especially when patients are hemodynamically stable at presentation. However, studies examining prognostic factors in this ED population remain lacking. Therefore, we aim to investigate the risk factors for in-hospital mortality in hemodynamically stable older adults with UTI and to develop a predictive model. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Sources and Population We conducted this study using the MIMIC-IV-ED database [ 16 17 18 Our inclusion criteria were older adults (≥65 years) with ED-diagnosed UTI requiring hospitalization. Exclusion criteria were as follows: systolic blood pressure (SBP) under 100 mmHg at triage, vasopressor use during ED stay, ICU admission within the first 12 h, and recurrent ED visits. Hemodynamic stability was defined as absence of shock at triage. Vasopressor use was defined as norepinephrine administration or its combination with vasopressin or epinephrine. UTI identification relied on the established International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions (ICD-9/ICD-10) with prior validation [ 19 Figure 1 2.2. Data Collection Data collection encompassed demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters obtained during the initial ED arrival. Patient demographics captured age, sex, race, and insurance coverage. Clinical assessments incorporated Emergency Severity Index (ESI), triage vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation), and medical history including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Initial laboratory evaluations comprised complete blood count parameters (white blood cell count [WBC], hemoglobin, red cell distribution width [RDW], platelet count), coagulation studies (prothrombin time), electrolyte panels (sodium, potassium), liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), bilirubin levels, glucose, renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine), urinalysis findings (leukocytes, erythrocytes), and cultured pathogen identification. Physiologically implausible vital sign and laboratory values were flagged as outliers and handled as missing data per MIMIC-EXTRACT protocols [ 20 21 2.3. Model Development and Statistical Analysis Demographic characteristics, vital signs, medical history, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes were described using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, while continuous variables were summarized as medians with interquartile ranges. We stratified patients into survivor and non-survivor groups. Comparisons between groups were conducted using either Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical data, and the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data. Variables with less than 20% missing observations were included as candidates for predictive model development. Missing values were imputed using multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) via the mice package [ 22 Supplementary Materials Figure S1 We employed Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression combined with 10-fold cross-validation to identify risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality [ 23 24 p 2 p 25 26 27 p 3. Results 3.1. Patient Characteristics A total of 1571 hemodynamically stable older adults (median age 79 years, IQR 72–85; 33% male) were admitted with UTI between 2011 and 2019 ( Figure 1 3.2.

Variable Selection and Model Development Utilizing the LASSO regression model with 10-fold cross-validation, we evaluated demographics, comorbidities, triage vitals, and laboratory measurements obtained at the initial ED visit. At the λ that minimized binomial deviance, eight variables retained non-zero coefficients: age, SBP, oxygen saturation, hypertension, congestive heart failure, WBC, RDW, and BUN ( Figure S2 p p p p p 3 −1 p p −1 p Table 2 p p p p p p Figure 2 3.4. Model Performance and Bootstrap Internal Validation The resulting six-variable model achieved an apparent C-statistic of 0.73 (95% CI 0.66–0.79). After 1000-sample bootstrap validation, optimism was 0.02, yielding a bias-corrected C-statistic of 0.71. Bootstrap-derived calibration analysis using 1000 resampled iterations revealed close concordance between predicted mortality probabilities and actual observed outcomes (Hosmer–Lemeshow χ 2 p Figure S3 Figure 3 p Figure 4 4. Discussion In this retrospective study of 1571 culture-confirmed, hemodynamically stable older adults admitted with UTI, six routine ED variables—age, lower SBP, lower oxygen saturation, higher WBC, elevated RDW, and higher BUN—were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. A nomogram built on these predictors was well calibrated and achieved moderate discrimination (C-statistic 0.73), outperforming MEWS (0.53) and NEWS (0.58), and thus offers potential to refine ED triage and management in this older population. To our knowledge, this is the first study and predictive model derived specifically for hemodynamically stable older ED adults with UTI. Recent nomograms aimed at predicting adverse outcomes in UTI or urosepsis have generally reported slightly higher discrimination than our predictive nomogram, but they have relied on markedly more complex inputs and settings that limit bedside adoption. Wei et al. built an ICU-based model for elderly urosepsis that combined the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), RDW, WBC, and the need for invasive ventilation, reaching an internal C-statistic of 0.82, yet the inclusion of organ-support variables available only after admission constrains early triage use [ 28 29 30 31 32 The variables anchoring our nomogram align with well-established mortality determinants. Hypoxemia captured by oxygen saturation likely signals impaired gas exchange, micro-circulatory shunting, or occult pulmonary infection; pre-hospital data show that each 3-point fall in oxygen saturation below 95% reduces 30-day survival in sepsis, independent of age and comorbidity [ 33 34 35 36 37 −1 38 Our study offers some methodological advantages that bolster confidence in the nomogram’s validity. The cohort of 1571 culture-confirmed UTIs represents one of the largest single-center elder-specific ED datasets to date. All modeling steps were repeated during 1000-sample bootstrap validation, a method widely endorsed for the internal validation of prediction models [ 39 40 41 Limitations This study has several limitations. First, it derives from a single urban, tertiary-care ED in the United States; practice patterns, case mix and microbiology may differ elsewhere, so external validity is uncertain. Second, the retrospective design relies on routinely collected data and is therefore subject to residual confounding and documentation bias. Third, although only 70 in-hospital deaths occurred, the model includes six predictors, giving an events-per-variable ratio of approximately 11.7—above the conventional ≥ 10 threshold recommended for logistic regression—yet coefficient stability and C-statistic precision should still be interpreted with caution. Fourth, although internal optimism was addressed with bootstrap resampling, we did not perform geographic or temporal external validation, which is essential before clinical implementation. Fifth, frailty and functional-status measures—key prognostic factors in geriatric infection—were unavailable in MIMIC-IV-ED, as were clinician gestalt variables such as symptom duration or nursing home residence. Sixth, UTI diagnoses and comorbidities were identified through ICD-9/-10 codes; even with validated algorithms, misclassification is possible and could dilute true associations. Additionally, although restricting the derivation cohort to culture-confirmed UTIs reduced diagnostic noise, it may also introduce spectrum bias. In routine ED practice, 30–45% of older adults who start antibiotics for suspected UTI later prove culture-negative, often because of non-infectious mimics or prior antimicrobial exposure. Our nomogram uses only triage vital signs and first laboratory values—information available long before culture results—so it can be calculated in real time; nonetheless, its accuracy in culture-negative or clinically diagnosed cases remains untested. Emerging culture-independent diagnostics could help bridge this gap. A recent systematic review of the urobiome reports that metagenomic next-generation sequencing yields approximately 81% sensitivity and 92% specificity for pathogen detection in urine—results delivered within hours—and highlights a broader shift toward rapid, comprehensive ED testing [ 42 5. Conclusions In this large cohort of hemodynamically stable older adults with UTI, we developed a six-variable ED nomogram—age, SBP, oxygen saturation, WBC, RDW, and BUN—that outperformed generic early warning scores and offers rapid, bedside estimation of in-hospital mortality. Its predictors are routinely available on ED arrival, facilitating earlier ICU consultation, informed goals-of-care discussions and risk-adjusted quality initiatives. Because the model was developed in a single U.S. tertiary-care ED, it remains hypothesis-generating until validated in external, multicenter cohorts. Prospective multicenter studies should confirm its generalizability and determine whether nomogram-guided care improves patient outcomes.
