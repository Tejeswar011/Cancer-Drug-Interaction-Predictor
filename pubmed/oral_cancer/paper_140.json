Among the most prescribed analgesic/anti‐inflammatory drugs in children with OE, ibuprofen represents the gold standard of conventional symptomatic therapies [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 Bromelain is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes which is extracted primarily from pineapple fruit ( Ananas comosus 15 16 Among bromelain compounds, Brome‐Inf is a freeze‐dried extract of pineapple, highly concentrated in bioactive peptides and bromelain, marketable as a food supplement or functional food. In this sense, although to the best of our knowledge there are no clinical studies relating to the use of bromelain in OE, bromelain has been particularly studied in various inflammatory diseases associated or not with edema component, demonstrating that it could reduce the doses or the number of administrations of conventional anti‐inflammatory/analgesic drugs [ 17 18 19 The study aimed to explore the potential of bromelain supplementation alongside antibiotic therapy for OE, with a focus on reducing the necessity for NSAIDs among children. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Extract Preparation In this work we scaled up the laboratory procedure previously reported [ 20 Ananas comosus g 1 FIGURE 1 (A) Pineapple processing; (B) core and pulp waste; (C) continuous single‐body press; (D) cooled membrane ultrafiltration; (E) industrial freeze‐drying; (F) industrial packaging. The scheme depicted in Figure 1 2.2 Analytical Control The concentrated juice was centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 × g 2.3 Protocol Features and Study Design This was a pilot, double‐blind, randomized study. It involved the enrolment of pediatric patients diagnosed with OE, who were randomized (1:1) to receive the product Brome‐Inf or placebo in addition to the antibiotic treatment for the disease. The proposed protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board from the SS. Antonio and Biagio and Cesare Arrigo hospital of Alessandria (Italy). Fourteen subjects were excluded for the presence of complex malformations of the urinary tract or pyelonephritis The study population included 60 males aged 6–18 years (Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Flowchart of participants in the study. In the pediatric department of the SS Antonio e Biagio and Cesare Arrigo Hospital, the practice guidelines currently mandate to investigate every boy presenting a suspected OE with blood test, urinalysis and testicular, urinary tract, and kidney ultrasonography, in agreement with international guidelines [ 21 The inclusion criteria were ages between 6 and 18 years, diagnosis of OE, normal renal function, absence of complex malformations of the urinary tract, and obtaining of informed consent. The presence of complex malformations of the urinary tract, acute pyelonephritis, any medical and surgical condition (resolved or unresolved testicular/spermatic cord torsion or sub‐torsion) that makes the patient's adherence to the study protocol complex or inconstant, assumption of other supplements, allergies or intolerances to the active ingredient or excipients were the exclusion criteria. The enrolled subjects presented a diagnosis of OE before the randomization of the study. After informed consent was obtained ( T  Orchiepididymitis At T T T 3 FIGURE 3 Study timeline. The study fully complied with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and with the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the SC Pediatric Urology of the SS Antonio e Biagio and Cesare Arrigo Hospital. 2.4 Treatment At T The oral preparation and packaging were carried out by Studio 3 Farma srl (Torre di Mosto, Italy), in compliance with Quality Management System ISO 9001:2015. Each subject randomly received a pack containing 76.5 g of powder (either active ingredients or placebo) and an appropriate measuring cup to consume the correct amount of daily product. In addition, subjects were instructed to take ibuprofen 200 mg as needed, if pain became significant (for a maximum of t.i.d.). For the entire duration of the study, patients were instructed to take the assigned treatment (Brome‐Inf or placebo) once at approximately the same time each day, preferably during the morning, in the fasted state. Randomization was performed centrally by computer‐generated codes. Participants and investigators were blinded to the group assignment. The alphanumeric codes (X and Y) of randomization remain sealed inside an envelope kept in the locked drawer of the main investigator's desk. They were opened at the end of the study by the principal investigator. 2.5 Efficacy Assessment The assessment of pain relies on subjective evaluation due to the lack of objective biochemical markers. In this context, the primary endpoint of the study was to investigate the comparison of the need for ibuprofen intake between the pineapple group and placebo and the intensity of pain by using the Wong‐Becker (smileys: children aged 6–10 years), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (for children >10 years of age), and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain rating scales. The Wong‐Baker Scale is one of several faces scales that has been demonstrated in multiple pediatric settings for pain assessment in the acute setting [ 22 NRS and VAS have been used since 1950 [ 23 24 25 26 Secondary endpoints were the evaluation of the ultrasound parameters (edema, scrotum size, epididymal commitment, and vascularity) through Echo Doppler analysis. Ultrasound examination for each patient was conducted with the Arietta 750 VE instrument, conducted by the radiologist on duty according to a standardized protocol. This protocol includes comparative longitudinal and transverse B‐mode scans of both testes, bilateral assessment of the spermatic cord and epididymis, and assessment of vascularization using Doppler techniques. The technical settings for the power Doppler were as follows: pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 750–1000 Hz, low wall filters, flow velocity range of 4–5 cm/s (low‐flow setting without noise) and color gain just below the level at which color noise occurs, with a range of 60%–70%. In B mode, the size and structure of the testes and epididymis, the course and thickness of the spermatic cord were assessed and checked for the absence of hydrocele, varicocele, or other pathological conditions (such as torsion of the testicular or epididymal process, scrotal edema, and hernias). The testicular vascularization was assessed with power Doppler with a scale validated in a previous study [ 25 2.6 Assessment of the Safety and Tolerability Tolerability and safety were assessed by continuous monitoring throughout the study to detect any adverse events and ensure the clinical safety of the treatments. A blinded, independent clinical event committee, appointed by the general clinical trial manager of the hospital, was tasked with categorizing any adverse events that occurred during the trial. These events were classified as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related to the tested treatment, based on previous pharmacological studies [ 27 The compliance with treatments was also monitored. The simplest way of measuring adherence is from the patient's self‐report [ 28 2.7 Statistical Analysis Personal data and physiological/pathological anamnesis were detected only at the enrolment visit (T‐0), treatment compliance only in T2, and the rest of the parameters at each visit from T0 to T2. It is believed that a sample size of 60 subjects in the context of a randomized, pilot trial design may be sufficient to evaluate the feasibility of the study, pending the planning of a possible larger controlled RCT. The statistical analysis was conducted with the help of the Graph‐Pad Prism 8.0.2 software. The results were reported as Mean ± SEM (Standard Error Mean), the number of patients ( n t p Comparative tests: the direct comparison has been carried out by treatment period and by combining data by type of treatment; for the normally distributed parameters, an unpaired t p p p p As already reported in the treatment after mandibular third molar surgery [ 29 3 Results Eighty‐seven patients were evaluated for the eligibility of the study. Fourteen subjects were excluded for the presence of complex malformations of the urinary tract or pyelonephritis. Seventy‐three people with acute OE were considered eligible for the study. However, 13 patients were excluded because parents (the legal guardians of minor children) declined the informed consent. Thus, 60 patients for whom their parents (legal guardians) provided informed consent and who had attended the follow‐up visits and completed the study were included in the final analysis. The mean patient age was 12.8 years (ranging 7–17). No statistically significant differences were observed in the demographic characteristics between the two groups (placebo and Brome‐Inf) (Table 1 TABLE 1 Average age and body mass index (BMI) of the subjects enrolled in the two groups.

In particular, clinical examination found the large painful inflammatory bursa as the main clinical sign in 90% of cases (54 patients). Both groups showed a significant reduction in perceived pain (VAS‐10, Wong‐Becker) from Day 1–15, except for the NRS parameter in the placebo group. Moreover, VAS‐10 at day = 15 was significantly reduced in the active group compared with placebo (Table 2 TABLE 2 Variation of VAS, NRS, and Wong Becker scores of the subjects enrolled in the two groups.

Moreover, Brome‐Inf supplementation showed a good palatability as well as excellent compliance and acceptability (100%). 4 Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial that investigated the analgesic effects of oral pineapple extract in children with OE. In this context, the reduction of VAS, NRS, and Wong‐Becker (Table 3 T T 2 T 30 31 32 33 p p p 34 35 36 37 Compliance with Brome‐Inf treatment was 100%, and facilitated by the fact that the product was a lyophilized extract of pineapple, dispersible in water, with excellent palatability. Moreover, no side effects were reported during the study. This study has some limitations such as the relatively small sample size with few enrolled patients and the lack of the evaluation of blood markers of inflammation. This was, however, the first study aiming to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of pineapple extract in children with OE. Moreover, the possible changes of plasmatic inflammatory markers, which may be reduced following the treatment with nutraceutical, was not measured; therefore, the effect of bromelain on inflammation remains to be elucidated. The current study is preliminary, and further research is required to investigate the long‐term effects of pineapple extract on a broader number of inflammatory parameters before definitively considering bromelain supplementation in clinical practice. Despite that bromelain demand is increasing significantly in the clinical field owing to its anti‐inflammatory, antiedematous, fibrinolytic, anticancer, anticoagulative, and antithrombotic properties [ 36 38 Despite the development of new viable protein purification methods such as re‐verse micellar systems, membrane filtration, aqueous two‐phase extraction, and chromatographic methods as well as biotechnological advances to reduce production costs, there are still some limitations that affect the efficiency of product recovery from crude plant extracts and the potency of the final extract. The enzyme complex is susceptible to irreversible thermal inactivation as occurs during pasteurization, and the increasing concentration of bromelain in raw pineapple juice during purification can lead to spontaneous enzymatic deactivation [ 39 Ananas comosus This is a pilot study to evaluate clinical outcomes based on parameters of routine clinical practice. The collection of additional biological samples, such as plasma for the analysis of molecular markers, was not planned, especially considering the pediatric population involved, where invasive procedures are minimized for ethical and practical reasons. Future integration of molecular biomarkers could provide further insights and improve the robustness of the results. This represents a valuable direction for larger studies in which such analyses could be appropriately designed and ethically justified. 5 Conclusions In this investigation, Brome‐Inf showed that it reduces the pain experienced safely and the need to take ibuprofen in younger people with OE. This effect is desirable given the known side effects of NSAIDs. Further RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate the anti‐inflammatory effects and confirm the applicability of Brome‐Inf treatment in children with OE. A dose‐finding strategy and possible combinations with other supplements should be investigated. Consent Patient consent was waived due to anonymous management of the data.
