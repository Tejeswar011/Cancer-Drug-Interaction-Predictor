This study aimed to explore the association between nasopharyngeal microbiota and PRNN in patients with recurrent NPC undergoing re-irradiation and to evaluate the predictive value of the microbiota for PRNN. Methods This retrospective study collected data from 113 patients with recurrent NPC who underwent re-irradiation at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2020 and November 2022. Patients were divided into necrosis and non-necrosis groups based on the development of necrosis after re-irradiation. 5R 16S rRNA sequencing of nasopharyngeal biopsy tissues conducted before re-irradiation was used to assess microbiota composition, diversity, and functional predictions. Clinical features and selected microbial markers were used in a random forest model to predict the occurrence of PRNN. Results Of the 113 patients with recurrent NPC who underwent re-irradiation, 60 developed PRNN, while 53 did not. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the nasopharyngeal microbiota of all the patients with recurrent NPC. The necrosis group exhibited significantly higher alpha diversity and distinct beta diversity than the non-necrosis group did. A predictive model that combined clinical features (gross tumor volume [GTV]) with microbiome characteristics achieved an AUC of 87.9% in the training set and 86.9% in the test set, demonstrating robust predictive performance. Conclusions Nasopharyngeal microbial diversity prior to re-irradiation was significantly higher in the necrosis group. Our predictive model, integrating clinical and microbial features, demonstrated strong performance in predicting PRNN and offers a promising tool for early intervention and prevention strategies.

To better understand the role of intratumoral microbiomes and their interaction with PRNN, this retrospective study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model based on clinical and microbial characteristics to assess PRNN risk following curative re-irradiation for recurrent NPC. Methods Study population We retrospectively reviewed the data of 146 patients diagnosed with recurrent NPC who underwent re-irradiation between January 2020 and November 2022 at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC). The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age between 18 and 70 years; (2) histopathologically confirmed locally recurrent NPC; (3) received re-irradiation at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; and (4) complete medical history records, imaging, and laboratory examinations available at the time of recurrent diagnosis and during treatment, with regular follow-up at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Exclusion criteria were: (1) presence of distant metastasis and (2) concurrent nasopharyngeal necrosis at the time of recurrence diagnosis. After the review, 113 patients with NPC met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on survival, recurrence, distant metastasis, and mortality were collected from medical records and follow-up assessments after re-irradiation. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. As a retrospective analysis, the need for informed consent for the use of archived tissue samples was waived. Patient confidentiality was maintained, and all data were anonymized before analysis. Clinical data Based on previous studies, we collected potential clinical characteristics related to PRNN from hospitalization records, including demographic factors (sex and age), medical history (allergy history, smoking history, alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus history), physical metrics (Body Mass Index [BMI], Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] score), tumor staging information (initial T-stage, initial N-stage, clinical stage, recurrent T-stage, recurrent N-stage, recurrent clinical stage), interval of recurrence, treatment details (concurrent chemotherapy or immunotherapy during re-irradiation, initial radiation dose and fractionation, recurrent GTV re-irradiation prescription dose and fractionation, duration of re-irradiation, accumulated total prescription dose [initial and recurrent]), and hematological and biochemical results, including white blood cell count (WBC#), neutrophil percentage (NEUT%), neutrophil count (NEUT#), red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (HGB), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Second-course radiotherapy All the patients were treated with IMRT. The GTV, clinical target volume (CTV), and organs at risk (OARs) were contoured slice-by-slice on CT images. The GTV was delineated based on fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy, planning CT, MRI, and PET-CT findings. The CTV was the GTV with a 5 mm margin (2 mm margin posteriorly), and the planning target volume was formed from the gross tumor volume and the clinical target volume with a 3 mm margin (1 mm margin posteriorly). For patients who were node-positive, the gross nodal tumor volume of the cervical lymph nodes (GTVnd) was outlined, and a 3 mm margin was added to form the planning target volume. Radiotherapy dose data were retrieved from the treatment planning system for further dose feature extraction. The prescribed doses were 60 Gy for the PTV derived from the GTV, 60 Gy for the PTV of the GTVnd (if node-positive), and 54 Gy for the PTV of the CTV, delivered in 27 fractions, once daily. These dose specifications were based on findings from a prospective clinical trial conducted at the SYSUCC [ 21 2 Follow-up duration Follow-up duration was defined as the time from completion of re-irradiation to the date of the last clinical follow-up (including symptom evaluation, nasopharyngoscopy, or MRI), measured in months. The distribution of follow-up durations in the necrosis and non-necrosis groups was compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Diagnosis of nasopharyngeal necrosis The diagnosis of PRNN was primarily confirmed through endoscopic evaluation, followed by biopsy, which is considered the gold standard. For patients in whom biopsy was not feasible, diagnosis relied on specific MRI features, including discontinuous nasopharyngeal mucosa lines and soft tissue defects without contrast enhancement, combined with clinical symptoms such as foul nasal odor, refractory headache, necrotic tissue, and skull base osteoradionecrosis observed in the nasopharyngeal cavity during endoscopy [ 22 Tissue collection Nasopharyngeal biopsy tissue was collected from 113 patients with recurrent NPC. Each biopsy tissue sample was paraffin-embedded and placed in a sterile, nucleus-free cryopreservation tube. To serve as a negative control for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a corresponding blank collection tube was prepared, left open in the collection area for 30 s, and immediately stored alongside the sample tubes. DNA/RNA extraction, amplification, sequencing DNA and RNA were extracted from nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsy tissues using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit, QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit, or QIAGEN DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN GmbH). Sterile pipettes, pipette tips, and nonenzymatic kit components were UV-irradiated for at least 1 h prior to use. Genomic DNA were extracted with the EZNA® Soil DNA kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines (D4015, Omega, Inc., USA) and stored immediately at − 80 °C for amplification.The 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region was amplified with slightly modified microbiome primers (515F-805 R) in a two-step PCR protocol [ 23 24 Alpha diversity was assessed using the Chao1 and Shannon indices in QIIME2, while beta diversity was characterized by principal component analysis (PCA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) with R packages ade4 and vegan. Statistical analyses of microbial data Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or median with interquartile range (IQR), while categorical data were described as frequencies. Differences in alpha diversity were verified using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Alpha diversity differences were assessed using the Wilcoxon test, and beta diversity, reflecting differences in sample community composition, was analyzed via PCA and PCoA using the weighted UniFrac index. The relationship between community composition and microbiome extrinsic elements was analyzed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and the VEGAN R packages. Differences in microbial abundance were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in the STAMP software. Statistically enriched microorganisms were identified using the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm, with an LDA score > 3 and Bonferroni-adjusted p Features selection and model construction Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify and distinguish independent clinical risk factors. This was followed by an analysis of differentially abundant ASVs, in which key microbiota features showing significant differences ( p For predictive modeling, the dataset was randomly divided into training and testing cohorts at a 6:4 ratio. Random forest models with stratified fivefold cross-validation were employed to predict PRNN. Two models were established based on different feature sets: (1) the Microbiota Model, which included only microbiological features, and (2) the GTV-Microbiota Model, which combined clinical variables with microbiological features. The performance of each model was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. Model comparisons were performed using the DeLong test to evaluate statistical differences in predictive performance. Prediction of pathway composition by PICRUSt2 Metagenomic functional composition from the taxa abundance was inferred using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2) [ 25 Results Patient characteristics This study included 113 patients with recurrent NPC, comprising 60 patients in the necrosis group and 53 in the non-necrosis group, categorized based on the occurrence of PRNN following re-irradiation.

Variables with a univariate analysis P-value < 0.2 were subsequently included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for sex and hemoglobin were 2.73 (95% CI: 0.74–10.11, P = 0.132) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96–1.04, P = 0.796), respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for GTV of the recurrent tumor was 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01–1.06, P = 0.018), indicating that GTV is an independent risk factor for PRNN after re-irradiation.

At the phylum level, the nasopharyngeal microbiota was predominantly composed of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Spirochaetes (Fig. 1 1 1 Fig. 1 The nasopharyngeal microbiome in non-necrosis group significantly differed from that in necrosis group. A B C D E D E n F Bacterial diversity differences between necrosis and non-necrosis groups To evaluate differences in bacterial diversity between groups, alpha diversity was assessed based on sequence alignment. The results showed that nasopharyngeal microbial alpha diversity indicated by Shannon and Chao1 indices was significantly higher in the necrosis group than in the non-necrosis group (Fig. 1 1 Phylogenetic profiles of nasopharyngeal microbial communities To identify differentially abundant taxa between the necrosis group and non-necrosis groups, LDA coupled with LEfSe was performed on the nasopharyngeal microbiota composition based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Functional predictions were analyzed across multiple databases, including Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), KEGG orthology (KO), protein families (PFAM), and The Institute for Genomic Research Protein Families (TIGRFAM), which feature curated multiple sequence alignments. Key functional differences were also identified. Within the KEGG pathways, notable functions included Carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes Glycerolipid metabolism Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism 3 ABC-type tungstate transport system Lipoate synthase Enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADH) 3 Fig. 3 Prediction of gene function in the nasopharyngeal microbiota. A B A B A B Clinical and microbiota models for predicting nasopharyngeal necrosis A total of 73 ASVs identified through LEfSe analysis demonstrated the predictive potential of PRNN. To evaluate the predictability of the nasopharyngeal microbiome, these ASVs were used as input features to construct the PRNN prediction model. The 113 patients were randomly divided into two cohorts: 36 necrosis and 31 non-necrosis cases in the training cohort and 24 necrosis and 22 non-necrosis cases in the test cohort. After five repeats of fivefold cross-validation, 18 microbial variables were identified as the optimal feature set for model construction. The Microbiota model showed a strong performance in the training cohort, achieving an AUC of 87% (95% CI, 81–93%) (Fig. 4 4 4 3 Fig. 4 Predictive performance of different models using nasopharyngeal microbiome and clinical features.

By comparing the necrosis group—patients who developed PRNN after re-irradiation—with the non-necrosis group, we identified significant differences in microbial composition between the two cohorts, with the necrosis group showing higher microbial diversity. These findings suggest a complex interaction between intratumoral microbiota, including genera such as Brevundimonas Caulobacteraceae Deinococcus Halomonas In recurrent NPC patients undergoing re-irradiation, the incidence of necrosis affecting the nasopharyngeal mucosa, soft tissues, and bone can reach as high as 30–50% [ 26 27 Previous studies have identified several clinical indicators, such as age, pathology, history of diabetes, and initial T stage, along with biochemical markers including hemoglobin, albumin, and C-reactive protein, as independent predictors of PRNN[ 28 3 29 13 Among patients with PRNN, localized nasopharyngeal infections are commonly observed, and local irrigation with saline or antibiotics has proven effective in alleviating necrosis [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 Our study provides a preliminary characterization of the intratumoral microbiota in patients with recurrent NPC, revealing that the predominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Notably, Proteobacteria, a phylum consisting entirely of Gram-negative bacteria, includes species such as Escherichia coli 36 Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus aureus 37 The analysis revealed significant differences in the composition, abundance, and diversity of intratumoral microbiota between the two groups. Specifically, patients with higher microbial diversity in the nasopharynx were more prone to develop PRNN after re-irradiation. Taxonomic profiling identified 17 taxa, including Brevundimonas Caulobacteraceae Oceanospirillales Corynebacterium To determine whether nasopharyngeal microbiota could predict PRNN following re-irradiation, we used 5R 16S rRNA sequencing to extract microbial features from biopsy tissues of patients with recurrent NPC. These microbial features were combined with clinical parameters (GTV) to develop two predictive models: the Microbiota Model, which is based solely on microbial features, and the GTV-Microbiota Model, which integrates both microbial features and GTV. Model performance was evaluated using a test set, and the results demonstrated that the GTV-Microbiota Model significantly outperformed both the Microbiota Model and traditional GTV-based model in predicting PRNN risk. PRNN and its associated severe epistaxis represent some of the most severe complications of recurrent NPC following re-irradiation. These adverse events not only significantly impact patients'quality of life, but also pose Life-threatening risks in severe cases. A recent multicenter, prospective, randomized phase 3 clinical trial demonstrated that hyperfractionated IMRT significantly reduces the incidence of PRNN by delivering lower doses twice daily instead of a single higher dose [ 7 Our study identified distinct microbial profiles between patients who developed PRNN and those who did not, indicating a potential association between the nasopharyngeal microbiota and PRNN risk. Further research is warranted to determine whether alterations in microbial composition contribute to PRNN development and to explore the potential of microbiota-based interventions in mitigating its occurrence. Profiling the nasopharyngeal microbiota prior to re-irradiation may serve as a valuable tool for identifying high-risk patients predisposed to PRNN. For these high-risk individuals, targeted interventions, such as precision antibiotic therapy or microbiota transplantation, could be explored to restore microbial balance, potentially mitigating PRNN risk. Future research should prioritize the development of high-throughput screening methods combined with advanced in vivo models to identify specific microbial taxa or metabolites that contribute to PRNN. Such studies could also focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which microbial dysbiosis exacerbates radiation-induced tissue damage. In parallel, randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of microbiota-based interventions, such as antibiotics, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation, could provide robust evidence for clinical application. By leveraging these advanced methodologies, future work has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of PRNN and improve treatment outcomes for patients with recurrent NPC. This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective design precluded the collection of longitudinal data, limiting our ability to assess temporal changes in the microbiota and their dynamic relationship with PRNN. Second, only three patients (2.7%) in our cohort had diabetes mellitus. This condition is associated with impaired immune function and increased susceptibility to infection, which may influence local tissue status and microbial composition. Third, antibiotic usage——a factor known to influence the composition and function of the tumor microbiome, was not accounted for, potentially affecting the tumor microenvironment and immune response. Future studies should include antibiotic history to better evaluate its impact on treatment outcomes and prognosis in patients with NPC. Lastly, the relatively low incidence of recurrent NPC and the limited number of patients opting for re-irradiation as a curative treatment constrained the sample size and may have affected the representativeness of our findings, potentially limiting the identification of the microbiota characteristics associated with PRNN. Conclusions This study demonstrated that nasopharyngeal microbial diversity prior to re-irradiation was significantly higher in the necrosis group than in the non-necrosis group. Building on this finding, we developed and validated a predictive model that integrates the clinical and microbial characteristics of PRNN. The model exhibited a robust predictive performance. These results underscore its potential as a valuable tool for identifying high-risk patients and guiding clinical decision making in re-irradiation strategies. Moreover, this work lays a solid scientific foundation for the early prediction and prevention of PRNN by leveraging insights into the nasopharyngeal microbiota.
