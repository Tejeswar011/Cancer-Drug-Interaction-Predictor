Introduction Depression is one of the most common mental health diseases and a dominant cause of disability around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it impacts approximately 280 million people worldwide and is associated with 700,000 suicides annually [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 7 8 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Intranasal (IN) administration offers a promising non-invasive approach. The unique anatomy of the nasal cavity and its direct connection with the brain through the olfactory and trigeminal pathways allow for bypassing of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and offer targeted nose-to-brain drug access, which is especially beneficial in acute situations [ 16 17 17 18 The promising potential of intranasal delivery of antidepressant-loaded nanosystems was reported in previous studies [ 19 20 21 19 20 21 Polymeric micelles (PMs) are nanosized self-assembled colloidal structures created from amphiphilic biocompatible copolymers. These co-polymers, formed of hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic tail groups, self-arrange into core–lipid micelles in aqueous media. This unique structure can ameliorate the solubility and bioavailability of many water-insoluble drugs [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 ® 28 ® ® 16 ® ® 29 ® ® 30 31 32 ® 32 33 34 32 ® 32 35 36 Eventually, the present study describes a novel formulation of optimized Pluronic-based thermoresponsive micelles of citalopram for intranasal administration. Based on preliminary studies, a carrier system was developed with adequate colloidal properties, which could overcome the limitations of systemic side effects and retarded onset of action by enhancing citalopram solubility and exploiting the temperature-triggered drug release properties of thermosensitive PMs highlighting the critical role of optimizing thermoresponsive polymer blends to improve the intranasal delivery of antidepressants. This manuscript details the comprehensive physicochemical characterization, in vitro release, and in vitro evaluation of drug permeability in intranasal conditions, laying the groundwork for future advancements in the targeted intranasal delivery of antidepressants with appropriate therapeutic efficacy. 2.

Quantitative Analysis of CT via High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) The quantitative determination of CT was performed via high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an Agilent 1260 Infinity (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) instrument. The stationary phase was a Kinetex ® 2.3. Formulation of CT-Loaded Polymeric Micelles The thin-film hydration method was applied to formulate CT-PMs. Various amounts of PF127, as presented in Table 1 Figure 1 2.4. Characterization of the Polymeric Micelles 2.4.1. Determination of LCST The dynamic light scattering (DLS) method was employed to monitor variations in the Z-average, which refers to the micelle size, and polydispersity index (PdI), as the micelle size distribution, of the CT-loaded PM to determine the LCST via Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). The freeze-dried samples, prepared using ScanVac CoolSafe 100–9 (LaboGene, ApS, Lynge, Denmark), by freezing and drying at −40 °C under a 0.013 mbar pressure for 12 h, followed by secondary drying for 6 h under a 0.013 mbar pressure at 25 °C, were dissolved in purified water. Then, the samples were transferred to disposable folded capillary cells and kept inside during the process of measuring at increasing temperatures, ranging from 25.0 to 40 °C at 1 °C increments, with a refractive index of 1.6 [ 29 40 41 29 n 2.4.2. Determination of Micelle Size and Size Distribution The investigations into the Z-average and PdI of the optimized formulation and blank micelles were carried out by the DLS method (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK) at an approximate temperature of 35 °C to closely mimic the nasal cavity temperature and assess micelle thermal behavior [ 31 n 2.4.3. Determination of Encapsulation Efficiency (EE%) The indirect method was used to determine the encapsulation efficiency of CT-PM [ 42 ® n (1) E E  % =  I n i t i a l  C T  mg − M e a s u r e d  C T  i n  t h e  s u p r e n a t a n t   ( mg ) I n i t i a l  C T  ( mg )  × 100 2.4.4. Determination of the Thermodynamic Solubility The saturation method was utilized to determine the enhancement of CT’s thermodynamic solubility in water [ 42 n 2.4.5. Biological Stability Test The effect of the presence of our optimized formulation in biological media SNES (pH 5.6), PBS (pH 7.4) and CSF (pH 7.4) on micelle size and zeta potential was evaluated using DLS. The freeze-dried samples were dissolved in the biological media. The solutions were incubated at 35 °C for SNES and 36.5 °C for PBS and CSF [ 43 44 n 2.5. Physical Stability Physical stability was tested to describe the colloidal stability of the polymeric micelles upon storage. Samples were investigated in the liquid and solid states via DLS. Samples were investigated under two conditions, based on the ICH Q1A (R2) guideline [ 45 n 2.6. X-Ray Powder Diffraction Study The crystalline structure of the freeze-dried products was characterized with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) with Cu K λI radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and a VANTEC-1 detector. In total, 40 kV of voltage and 40 mA of amperage were used during the measurements. The angular range was 3° to 4° 2θ with a step time of 0.1 s and a step size of 0.007°. The manipulations and evaluations were carried out using EVA Software v6. 2.7. In Vitro Nasal Applicability Studies 2.7.1. In Vitro Drug Release Study The dialysis bag method was applied to perform the drug release study under sink conditions in case of polymeric micelle formulation. Initially, 1 mL of the in-water dissolved freeze-dried formulation (concentration: 1 mg/mL) and initial CT aqueous suspension (the reference, concentration: 1 mg/mL) was placed in presoaked dialysis tubes (Spectra/Por ® n 2.7.2. Mathematical Analysis of the Drug Release The obtained cumulative CT release data of the optimized formulation and CT aqueous suspension were subjected to different mathematical approaches (zero-order, first-order, Hixson–Crowell, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer–Peppas models).

Results 3.1. Characterization of the Micelles in a Liquid State 3.1.1. Preliminary Studies The optimal formulation was selected based on the critical parameters of thermosensitive polymeric micelles. Z-average is an essential attribute as it affects pharmacokinetics, stability, and the capability of brain penetration [ 48 24 49 49 50 32 Table 2 Based on these findings, CT-PM3 was selected as the optimal formulation for further development and evaluation. 3.1.2. Determination of the LCST In order to assess the thermal behavior of CT-loaded polymeric micelles, the Z-average and PdI of the optimized formulation (CT-PM3) were measured at a temperature range of 25 to 40 °C. As shown in Figure 2 51 52 53 54 3.1.3. Micelle Size and Size Distribution The DLS method was used to measure the Z-average and PdI of our optimized formulation and blank micelles at 35 °C. Nose-to-brain delivery could ideally be achieved with a particle size below 200 nm. Furthermore, the optimal size range of polymeric micelles is from 10 to 100 nm, which optimizes circulation time and evades the uptake by monophagocytic system (MPS) and renal filtration [ 24 49 Table 3 p ® ® w v ® w v 55 56 57 The narrow size distribution is also considered crucial for PM to ensure high stability, a predictable drug release profile, and consistent cellular uptake [ 58 49 50 The zeta potential of our formulation is almost negligible, yet the charge of both used co-polymers is near-neutral. It has been reported in previous studies that micelles with neutral or mildly negative surface charge can efficiently cross the nasal mucosa and exhibit prolonged blood circulation [ 29 59 3.1.4. Characterization of Solubilization The thermodynamic solubility and the encapsulation efficiency of the optimized formulation were determined. Using the saturation method, the thermodynamic solubility of CT revealed a 95-fold increase ( p 23 60 23 61 3.1.5. Biological Stability Test The stability of optimized formulation in biological solutions, SNES, PBS, and CSF was evaluated by measuring the Z-average by the DLS method at predetermined time intervals. This test indicates the micelle’s behavior after intranasal administration. The obtained results in Figure 3 62 63 3.2. Physical Stability The results of the physical stability test can be found in Figure 4 3.3. X-Ray Powder Diffraction Study (XRPD) The X-ray powder diffraction study compared the crystallinity of the individual components and the final freeze-dried formulation (CT-PM3). The diffractograms can be seen in Figure 5 ® ® 3.4. In Vitro Nasal Applicability Studies 3.4.1. In Vitro Drug Release Study Evaluating drug release is essential for assessing the efficiency of the drug delivery system compared to the initial drug, as it serves as a critical biopharmaceutical parameter. Based on the data in Figure 6 p 37 49 62 63 Calculated parameters for drug release kinetics profiles are shown in Table 4 2 46 2 64 65 2 66 3.4.2. In Vitro Drug Permeation Study A modified Side-by-side ® Figure 7 p Figure 8 This improvement is a result of the enhanced CT dissolution, micelle nanoscale size, micelle thermosensitive behavior, and the surfactant nature of the polymers, which collectively facilitate absorption through the membrane. The promoted permeability indicates the capability of this delivery system to provide a faster onset of action and enhance bioavailability via intranasal administration. 4. Discussion In this study, a citalopram-loaded thermosensitive polymeric micelle formulation was developed and evaluated to assess its suitability as a brain-targeted intranasal delivery system for citalopram. This formulation was prepared by the thin-film hydration method, a widely used laboratory and pilot-scale technique for forming polymeric micelles and mixed micellar systems because it ensures good control over drug/polymer ratios, drug loading, and micelle size while remaining amenable to scale-up when process parameters are optimized [ 67 68 69 70 71 Physicochemical characterization at nasal temperature (35 °C) showed that the micelle size is approximately 31.4 nm with a PdI of 0.240, indicating a narrow size distribution and limited aggregation, as well as a size and homogeneity that favor diffusion across the nasal mucosa and reduced mucociliary clearance to larger particulates. Additionally, the near-neutral zeta potential enhanced mucosal compatibility and colloidal stability. Neutral or slightly negative surfaces often strike a balance between mucoadhesion and permeation for nose-to-brain targeting [ 72 73 A notable functional attribute of the polymeric micelles was that it possesses a thermosensitive behavior, with an LCST value of approx. 31 °C. This value is kinetically convenient, as it supports stability at room temperature while facilitating a targeted triggered drug release at the nasal cavity temperature of 35 °C [ 32 The encapsulation efficiency of 88.85 ± 1.23% was achieved, signifying the quite efficient loading of CT into the micelle core. Furthermore, A 95-fold increase in CT thermodynamic solubility was achieved compared to the initial CT. The substantial 95-fold increase can be due the following synergistic mechanisms: (i) nanoscale solubilization with low micelle size; (ii) high encapsulation efficiency reducing the fraction of free crystalline drug; and (iii) the amorphous state of CT after freeze-drying, also contributing to rapid dissolution [ 74 75 76 The in vitro drug release and permeation data further validated the formulation’s functional advantages, as a 25-fold increase in drug release and a 4-fold increase in nasal drug flux was experienced compared to unformulated CT. Such improvements are consistent with the effects of the highly efficient solubilization, the reduced diffusion path lengths for drug molecules desorbing from nanoscale carriers, and the thermokinetic behavior triggered by the nasal conditions [ 77 78 5. Conclusions In summary, it can be claimed that the thermosensitive polymeric micelle system is a promising approach to tackle the challenges of intranasal administration of brain-targeted drugs. However, further in vivo pharmacokinetics, long-term stability, and cytotoxicity investigations should be conducted to confirm safety, real efficacy, and reproducibility. Moreover, this formulation could serve as a base for additional developments in the field of intranasal delivery systems.
