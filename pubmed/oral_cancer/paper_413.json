Reaction controls were performed by thin-layer chromatography\n(TLC) on Macherey-Nagel-precoated 60 F254 silica plates. Spots were\nvisualized by ultraviolet (UV) light (254 nm) or staining solutions.\nFlash column chromatography was carried out using Grace Davison Davisil\nLC60A (20−45 μm) or Merck Geduran Si60 (mesh 63−200\nμm) with a LaFlash automated flash chromatography system. NMR\nspectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer at ambient\ntemperature. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million\n(ppm) relative to the internal control tetramethylsilane (TMS), and\nthe spectra were calibrated against the residual solvent peak of the\nused deuterated solvent. Coupling constants ( J 2 4 General Procedure\nA for the HATU-Supported Amide Synthesis The corresponding\ncarboxylic acid (1 equiv. in DMF, 5 mL) was added\nto the solution at 0 °C, followed by the sequential addition\nof HATU (1.2 equiv.). The solution was maintained at 0 °C for\n30 min. Subsequently, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (3 equiv.) and\nthe coupling partner amine (1 equiv.) were added in a slow, controlled\nmanner. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h and at 25 °C\nfor 12 h. The reaction mixture was quenched by adding water, and the\norganic phase was extracted with EtOAc (three times, 15 mL each).\nThe combined organic phases were washed with a saturated solution\nof ammonium chloride (2 × 25 mL), a saturated solution of sodium\nbicarbonate (2 × 25 mL), and a solution of sodium chloride (2\n× 25 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,\nfiltered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude\nmaterial was purified by column chromatography. General Procedure\nB for the Synthesis of Hydrazides To a stirred suspension\nof the ester (1.0 equiv. ratio) in 5 mL of\nmethanol, hydrazine monohydrate (10 equiv. ratio, 80% solution in\nwater) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred at 25 °C\nfor 24 h. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, isolating\nthe product as a white solid. The resulting crude material was subjected\nto the subsequent step without additional purification. General Procedure\nC for the Synthesis of Hydrazones The hydrazide derivative\n(1 equiv.) was dissolved in THF (dry, 10\nmL), followed by the addition of the aldehyde (1 equiv.) and catalytic\nacetic acid (1−2 drops). The solution was then permitted to\nstir at 50 °C for 1 h and at 25 °C overnight. Once the reaction\nhad reached completion, the mixture was concentrated under reduced\npressure. The resulting crude material was utilized in the subsequent\nstep without additional purification. General Procedure D for\nthe Reduction of Hydrazones To the solution of the corresponding\nhydrazone (1 equiv. in CH 2 2 p 2 2 2 2 2 4 General Procedure\nE for the Synthesis of Amides The\namine was dissolved in acetone (HPLC-grade, 8 mL) and cooled to 0\n°C. Thereafter, sodium bicarbonate (3 equiv.) was added to the\nsolution. The mixture was then stirred for 10 min at the same temperature.\nSubsequently, the carboxylic acid chloride or anhydride (1.1 equiv.\ndiluted in acetone by approximately 1/20) was added dropwise. The\nmixture was then stirred for an additional hour at 0 °C. The\nreaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to afford\nthe crude product. The crude material was purified by column chromatography. General Procedure F for the T3P-Supported Amide Synthesis To a solution of the carboxylic acid or its sodium salt (3 equiv.\neach), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (4 equiv.), and a 50 wt. % solution\nof 1-propanephosphonic anhydride in EtOAc (4 equiv.) in DMF (dry,\n5 mL), the amine (1 equiv.) and DIPEA (5 equiv.) were added at 0 °C.\nThe reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and saturated sodium bicarbonate\nafter an overnight stirring period at ambient temperature. The organic\nlayer was subsequently separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted\nwith EtOAc (2 × 15 mL). The combined organic layers were dried\nover sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure\nto afford the product. The crude material was purified by column chromatography.

A SARS-CoV-2 strain\nJPN/TY/WK-521/2020 (SARS-CoV-2 WK521  Antiviral Activity and\nCytotoxicity Assays Two clinical\nisolates, SARS-CoV-2 WK521 BQ.1.1, 4 WK-521 BQ.1.1 50 4 50 Cell Line and Virus The Vero AT cells (BEI, #NR-54970)\nwere used to assess the CPE. This study used an attenuated strain\nof SARS-CoV-2 containing a deletion of ORF3a and ORF7b (rSARS-CoV-2\nΔ3a/7b) Measurement of Antiviral\nActivity The antiviral activity\nwas measured by inhibiting virus-induced CPE by adding compounds to\nconfluent Vero AT cells in 96-well microplates. After 3 h, the viral\nsuspensions of the live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 strain (120 PFU/well)\nwere added, resulting in a final concentration of 20 μM, achieved\nthrough a serial dilution (5-fold) over 10 experimental points. At\n4 days postinfection, Cell-Titer Glo-based readout (according to the\nmanufacturer’s protocol) was used to measure the number of\nviable cells. The readouts were normalized and plotted using GraphPad\nPrism software. In parallel, sets of cells were fixed and stained\nwith 0.5% violet crystal solution for 5 min and imaged using a LiCor\nimager. For CPE-based experiments, the mean values ± SD are derived\nfrom 2 to 6 experimental replicates.
