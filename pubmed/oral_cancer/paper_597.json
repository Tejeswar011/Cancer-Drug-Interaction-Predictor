Background In women with ductal carcinoma in situ Methods We retrospectively analyzed 140 DCIS patients from Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital (2011-2020, followed up to 2025). Preoperative digital mammograms and clinicopathological data were collected, with mammographic features extracted using pyradiomics and supervised by a senior radiologist. Feature selection employed 10-fold cross-validated LASSO regression. The dataset was split into training (n=100) and validation (n=40) sets (10:4 ratio). Sixteen machine learning algorithms combining mammographic deep learning features and clinicopathological variables were developed and compared for predicting DCIS recurrence. Model performance was assessed using ROC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and SHAP values for interpretation. Results The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm had the best predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.918 (95% CI 0.873-0.963) in the test set. SHAP values indicated that the mammographic signature (MS) was the most significant predictor, followed by Ki-67 index and histological grade. Patients not receiving radiotherapy had higher recurrence rates than those who did. Decision curve analysis validated the model’s clinical utility across various risk thresholds. Conclusion Our study developed an interpretable GBM model incorporating mammographic and clinical data to predict DCIS recurrence (AUC = 0.918). Key predictors were mammographic signature, Ki-67, and tumor grade, offering clinicians a practical tool for personalized postoperative management. ductal carcinoma in situ breast-conserving surgery mammography deep learning recurrence The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Exclusion criteria comprised: (1) distant metastasis or invasive carcinoma; (2) other malignant tumors; (3) missing key data (e.g., imaging or molecular markers); (4) history of breast radiotherapy or loss to follow-up. The follow-up endpoint of this study was April 1, 2025. Following the completion of appropriate therapeutic interventions, patients underwent systematic monitoring through clinical consultations, telephonic communication, or electronic correspondence at three-month intervals during the initial six-month period, subsequently at six-month intervals for a maximum duration of five years, and thereafter on an annual basis, with the principal objective of identifying disease recurrence. Imaging acquisition and interpretation Digital mammographic imaging was performed utilizing Mammomat Novation DR (Siemens AG Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) and Selenia Dimensions (Hologic, Bedford, Mass, USA) systems, incorporating both craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique projections. The region of interest (ROI) showing the most suspicious lesion in the CC-view for each patient was prioritized. To ensure reliable and reproducible BI-RADS categorization, two experienced radiologists conducted independent evaluations of all imaging studies. (R4-R6 with ≥ 8 years of mammography experience, respectively). Consensus regarding the final diagnostic assessment was achieved through collaborative discussion when interpretive differences arose. The interpreting radiologists remained unaware of histopathological findings while retaining access to relevant clinical data and previous imaging studies. Based on the 2013 American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification framework, lesions designated as categories 2 or 3 were characterized as benign or likely benign entities, while those assigned categories 4 or 5 were classified as potentially malignant findings warranting histopathological confirmation. Data preprocessing Calcified regions in the mammography images were annotated as follows: for diffusely distributed calcifications, the entire area was uniformly annotated; for multiple independent calcification clusters, the specific cluster indicated for biopsy in the radiology report was prioritized; and for large calcified areas, the entire scope was annotated. All calcification region annotations were independently completed by two trained annotators (SA: MD; MM: medical technology researcher) using 3D Slicer software (version 4.10.2) on full images supervised by a senior breast radiologist (RM). Tumor recurrence encompassed both localized recurrence and metastatic spread to distant tissues or organs. Localized recurrence was characterized as tumor reappearance within the ipsilateral breast, chest wall, or corresponding regional lymph nodes. Neoplasm classification was conducted in accordance with the eighth edition of the AJCC staging criteria. All lymph node-positive (LMN+) cases were confirmed pathologically. Based on the established criteria from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP), estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positivity were characterized as ≥ 1% of tumor cell nuclei demonstrating positive staining. HER2 expression was determined in accordance with the 2018 ASCO/CAP criteria, whereby immunohistochemistry scores of 3+ are classified as positive, while scores of 2+ are deemed positive when HER2 gene amplification is confirmed through fluorescence in situ Machine learning model development First, considering the different measurement units among variables, all variables were normalized using “StandardScaler.” Subsequently, to address feature dependency, Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed. When the correlation coefficient between any two variables exceeded 0.9, one variable was removed from the analysis. Between-group comparisons were conducted using the Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical data are presented as percentages (%), with Pearson’s chi-square analysis employed to assess between-group variations. The sample dataset was partitioned into training (n = 100) and internal validation (n = 40) cohorts using a 10:4 allocation ratio ( 12 13 14 15 16 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 16 24 25 26 27 13 28 29 28 28 29 29 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using R Studio version 4.3.3 and Jupyter Notebook 5.6.0. For categorical data, chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests were used ( 30 Results The research methodology is illustrated in  Figure 1 Figure 1 Brief technical flowchart.

Model performance comparison Initially, we hypothesized that a comprehensive integration of clinical features might provide key insights for predicting DCIS recurrence outcomes. Therefore, we obtained 21 clinical features from the electronic medical records and identified four strongly correlated variables through analysis and integration. These four variables were used to develop a predictive model for DCIS recurrence. In the present investigation, ten machine learning algorithms (PLS, RF, DTS, SVM, Logistic, KNN, XGBoost, GBM, NeuralNet, and glmBoost) were evaluated within the discovery dataset to assess their predictive capabilities (  Figures 4A, B  Figures 4C, D Figure 4 Performance comparison of machine learning models receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 10 ML algorithms in (A) (B) (C, D) Four panels depict ROC curves for different models and features.

Legends provide performance metrics, including area under the curve and confidence intervals for each method. Regarding clinical utility, the four-variable model demonstrated substantial net benefits across diverse threshold probability ranges alongside the GBM model; nevertheless, the GBM model displayed superior net benefit performance, thereby validating its designation as the most effective predictive framework for DCIS recurrence (  Figures 5A, B  Figure 5C  Figure 5D  Figure 5E Figure 5 Model interpretability and clinical utility analysis (A, B) (C) (D) (E) Five-panel image showing decision curve analyses and SHAP value plots.

Discussion This investigation involved the development and performance evaluation of 10 ML algorithms utilizing 21 clinical parameters, encompassing clinical characteristics, mammographic imaging data, and histopathological findings, to forecast long-term recurrence (≥5 years) in DCIS patients following BCS. The findings demonstrated that the GBM model achieved optimal performance with a test set AUC of 0.918, displaying superior predictive capacity compared to the remaining four individual risk signatures and consequently providing substantial clinical utility. To enhance model interpretability, we employed the SHAP methodology for visualization purposes. SHAP force plots were utilized to elucidate the individualized prediction process for DCIS recurrence risk assessment, thereby facilitating comprehensive understanding of the underlying predictive mechanisms ( 29 Most recent studies on predicting recurrence after BCS for DCIS rely solely on single data sources—such as clinicopathological features or imaging indicators—and do not integrate multimodal data, which may lead to the omission of key predictive information ( 10 31 33 34 35 10 33 In the present study, the GBM algorithm, an advanced ensemble learning method based on gradient boosting, demonstrated excellent predictive performance in medical datasets with complex feature interactions. By organically combining DL features from mammography with clinicopathological variables, the GBM model significantly outperformed traditional ML methods in predicting the risk of DCIS recurrence. Compared with traditional LR models, the GBM algorithm more effectively captures nonlinear relationships and feature interactions through its iterative boosting process while maintaining strong robustness to data noise and outliers. SHAP value analysis quantitatively showed that the MS was the most influential predictor, followed by Ki-67 index and histological grade, consistent with the clinical knowledge of DCIS progression. The MS is a composite quantitative score derived from deep learning analysis of preoperative breast X-ray imaging. Although algorithm-generated, its numerical value correlates with visually identifiable radiological features associated with known and invasive lesions. Higher MS scores typically correspond to breast X-ray imaging manifestations characterized by: cluster-like microcalcifications without masses (such as fine speckled, linear, and branched patterns), which may also present as single or multiple masses, particularly those showing a mouse-tail-like blurring at the posterior edge along ductal pathways. The model’s excellent predictive performance (AUC = 0.918) benefits from the ability of the GBM algorithm to process high-dimensional feature spaces while effectively avoiding overfitting through regularization. More importantly, the introduction of SHAP interpretation provides clinicians with transparent model decision-making bases, effectively addressing the common “black box” problem of complex ML models. This optimal combination of prediction accuracy and interpretability renders our GBM framework suitable for decision support in the clinical management of DCIS. Earlier research has demonstrated that adjuvant radiotherapy substantially diminishes the likelihood of local disease recurrence following breast-conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ 36 37 While our model demonstrates strong discriminative capabilities, several critical limitations of this study must be noted. Firstly, the relatively limited sample size—particularly when compared to the original high-dimensional feature set—may raise concerns about overfitting due to the reduced number of events. To address this, we implemented rigorous feature reduction techniques (such as LASSO regression) and cross-validation to mitigate these issues. However, some highly complex models (such as decision trees and extreme random forests) still exhibited overfitting on the training set (AUC = 1.000), highlighting the importance of rigorous model selection and validation in high-dimensional data. The GBM model we ultimately selected demonstrated outstanding and consistent performance across both training and test sets, indicating its strong generalization capability. Nevertheless, this result should be viewed with caution. Secondly, this is a retrospective study conducted by a single institution, with its sample exclusively drawn from the Asian (China) population. The inherent selection bias in this design, combined with the homogeneity of genetic background, lifestyle patterns, and healthcare practices within the population, severely limits the external validity and generalizability of our predictive model. Therefore, before implementing this model in clinical practice, it must undergo large-scale external validation in multicenter prospective cohorts encompassing diverse geographic distributions, ethnicities, and racial backgrounds. Future research should focus on validating the model’s robustness through larger-scale samples. Only after demonstrating its effectiveness across broader populations can this model be considered a universally applicable decision support tool. Thirdly, regarding post-breast-conserving surgery adjuvant therapy details, our study is constrained by the completeness of available retrospective data. While we documented the implementation of adjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and adjuvant radiotherapy, specific protocol details (such as chemotherapy cycle counts and dosages; endocrine drug selection and treatment duration; total radiation dose, fractionated regimens, and brachytherapy usage) and technical specifications were not consistently available for all patients. Consequently, our analysis could not account for potential variations in radiotherapy protocols that might influence recurrence outcomes and constitute unmeasured sources of confounding factors. Finally, while multimodal data were integrated, the extraction of imaging features mainly relied on two-dimensional mammography images and did not include richer imaging information such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Conclusion This research documented the utilization of machine learning methodologies incorporating mammographic imaging characteristics, clinical data, and laboratory measurements for forecasting recurrence among DCIS patients, establishing a GBM algorithmic framework capable of accurately estimating DCIS recurrence probability. In this study, the combination of ML with the interpretable SHAP method endowed the “black-box” ML model with interpretability, making it more suitable for predicting DCIS recurrence in clinical scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of DCA highlights the clinical value of GBM. We propose the use of this approach as an auditable decision-support tool to facilitate patient healthcare and research.
