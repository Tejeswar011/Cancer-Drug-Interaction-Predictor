It is usually characterized by cytopenia, particularly neutropenia, and may be associated with autoimmune disease. We report a case of a 56-year-old Moroccan female patient presenting with a 2-month history of dry eye syndrome, asthenia, and severe neutropenia. Initial investigations revealed lymphocytosis, and the peripheral blood smear revealed approximately 13% of large granular lymphocytes. Flow cytometry confirmed T-LGLL with a CD3+, CD8+, CD57+ phenotype. First-line treatment with low-dose methotrexate yielded no improvement after six months. The patient was then successfully treated with oral cyclophosphamide, with normalization of neutrophil and hemoglobin levels, and resolution of sicca symptoms. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and tailored immunosuppressive therapy in managing T-LGLL, particularly in patients with severe neutropenia.

Other autoimmune conditions, such as Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autoimmune thyroiditis, may also occur [ 3 4 Due to its indolent course, many patients with T-LGLL do not require immediate treatment. However, therapy is indicated in symptomatic individuals, particularly those with severe neutropenia, anemia requiring transfusions, or associated autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppression. Standard treatment typically involves low-dose methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporin A, with targeted therapies such as Alemtuzumab reserved for refractory cases [ 5 We report a case of T-LGLL in a 56-year-old Moroccan woman presenting with isolated profound neutropenia and sicca symptoms, diagnosed via peripheral blood smear and immunophenotyping. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in resource-limited settings and underscores the value of a structured, multidisciplinary approach to rare hematologic diseases. Case report A 56-year-old woman presented to our hematology clinic with a 3-month history of progressive fatigue and sicca symptoms (dry eyes and mouth). Her medical history included well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, managed with oral medications. She had no history of recurrent infections, weight loss, or night sweats, and there was no personal or family history of hematologic malignancy or autoimmune disease. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or hepatomegaly. Her mucous membranes were dry, but no oral ulcers or joint abnormalities were noted. Laboratory tests showed isolated lymphocytosis (6311 cells/mm 3 3 Fig. 1 Figure 1 Patient’s blood smear showing large monomorphic granular lymphocytes with numerous rolled red blood cells (A, B, C and D). Further laboratory test included vitamin B12 and folate levels, which were normal, ruling out nutritional causes of cytopenia. A comprehensive autoimmune panel, including ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB, was negative. Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test was also negative. Bone marrow aspiration was attempted but was technically unsuccessful. However, the core biopsy demonstrated normocellular marrow without evidence of malignancy or dysplasia. Flow cytometry performed on peripheral blood identified a clonal T-cell population expressing CD3 + − + + − + + Despite the absence of molecular confirmation, the diagnosis of T-LGLL was considered established based on the patient’s clinical presentation (neutropenia, sicca symptoms), characteristic peripheral blood smear morphology, and immunophenotypic findings on flow cytometry. This diagnostic approach is accepted in real-world clinical practice, particularly in low-resource environments. Treatment was initiated with low-dose methotrexate (10 mg/m 2 Fig. 2 Figure 2 Patient’s neutrophil and lymphocyte counts on treatment. Discussion First described in 1985, LGLL is now recognized as a distinct lymphoproliferative disorder originating from mature T or NK cells [ 6 7 4 T-LGLL typically affects older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 66 years [ 1 Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and molecular findings. On peripheral smear, LGLs appear as large lymphocytes with characteristic azurophilic granules. Flow cytometry is essential for identifying a clonal T-cell population. Our patient had the typical immunophenotype of CD3 + + + + 8 9 Treatment is generally reserved for symptomatic patients. The main indications include symptomatic cytopenias (particularly neutropenia < 500 cells/mm 3 3 10 Targeted therapies such as Alemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against CD52, have shown promise in refractory disease with an overall response rate of 60%, but are limited by cost, accessibility, and immunosuppression-associated infections [ 5 Our patient failed to respond to methotrexate but achieved durable remission with cyclophosphamide, highlighting the need for individualized therapy. In resource-constrained environments, the choice of treatment must balance efficacy, safety, availability, and cost. Conclusion This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by T-LGLL, especially in settings where molecular diagnostics and targeted therapies are unavailable. In patients with unexplained neutropenia, particularly when persistent and profound, T-LGLL should be considered even in the absence of autoimmune markers. A comprehensive diagnostic approach incorporating cytology, flow cytometry, and, when available, molecular testing is critical for accurate diagnosis. Immunosuppressive therapy remains the cornerstone of management, and cyclophosphamide may be a valuable second-line option when methotrexate fails. Multicenter collaboration and investment in diagnostic infrastructure are essential for improving outcomes in rare hematologic malignancies in low-resource regions.
