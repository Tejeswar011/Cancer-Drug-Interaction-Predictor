Methods A cross-sectional study included 351 peri- and postmenopausal women from two tertiary care hospitals in the United Arab Emirates. To select the best model, we ran a finite-mixture partial least squares segmentation (FIMIX-PLS). The number of resulting segments was used to run a partial least squares-predicted-oriented segmentation to assign cases to segments and maximize the segment-specific explained variance (R 2 Results A two-segment model was identified (Entropy > 0.8, Corrected-Akaike’s Information Criterion = 1977.11; Bayesian Information Criterion = 1960.11), which indicated adequate and well-separated segments. The first and second segments had 179 and 171 of the cases, respectively, which were considered substantive representations of both segments. The model resulted in a weighted average R 2 Conclusion The acceptability of vaginal treatments differs between experienced and anticipated users. Considering patient-related factors and previous treatment experiences can serve as a benchmark to improve patient acceptability of treatment.

Current clinical guidelines including the 2020 position statement of the North American Menopause Society and the British Menopause Society, recommend local vaginal treatments as the preferred route if the only complaint is urogenital symptoms rather than vasomotor symptoms, which usually require systematic therapy [ 1 2 Many women do not seek treatment due to embarrassment, lack of awareness, or the belief that symptoms are a normal part of aging [ 3 4 5 6 8 9 Treatment preferences and acceptability represent two relevant but distinct concepts. Treatment preference was defined to represent patient’s choice of treatment to manage their clinical condition among other alternative treatments. Acceptability, on the other hand, was defined as the positive or favourable attitude toward these treatment options [ 10 11 12 11 5 Methods Study settings and participants A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 351 participants who were purposefully sampled from two distinct tertiary hospitals in the United Arab Emirates between 5 th th 13 Study instrument The genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms and vaginal treatment acceptability questionnaire (GSM-SVTAQ) is a GSM-specific, multi-dimensional patient-reported outcomes measure [ 14 11 Fig 1 11 12 10.1371/journal.pone.0331110.g001 Fig 1 Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Adopted from [ 11 http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ Conceptual framework Our selection of intervention coherence, affective attitude, self-efficacy, and perceived effectiveness was based on their fundamental interconnections within a proposed conceptual framework ( Fig 2 10.1371/journal.pone.0331110.g002 Fig 2 Conceptual Framework. Study procedures Eligible patients were invited by the site sub-investigator for a brief discussion on the nature of the study, its objectives, and the nature of participation. These discussions were primarily after the patient’s visit with her gynecologist was over to ensure her comfort. The participant was prompted to a link that gives her access to the participant information sheet. Participants were then encouraged to provide their consent before they could have access to the study questionnaire. If the patient showed a willingness to participate, she was then given access to the structured data collection form and the GSM-SVTAQ through a scanned QR code, which was placed at a convenient location at the clinic. The structured form was developed to collect data on the socio-demographic of participants. All study materials were provided in English and Arabic so that participants choose the language of their preference. Statistical methods To identify unobserved (hidden) subgroups of acceptability to vaginal treatments among menopausal women, a person-centred approach was required to define the heterogeneous subgroups that can potentially benefit from a common intervention, emphasizing that we did not have an explanatory variable that identifies these groups in meaningful clinical profiles. Latent segment analysis aims to detect unobserved heterogeneity within a sample based on how participants answer a variety of questions about the treatment (observed variables). This “person-centered” approach helps describe who 15 17 To determine the optimal number of latent segments and their respective sizes, a finite mixture segmentation-partial least squares (FIMIX-PLS) was performed. The FIMIX-PLS was first introduced by Hann et al. [ 18 19 19 20 21 22 23 Measures and selection of indicator variables No consensus exists on the number of indicator variables to include in a latent class analysis model [ 24 14 25 Class solution selection We started with a one-class model and then specified models with an additional class at a time until the best model was identified. The final selected model was based on both statistical criteria and interpretability based on our theoretical understanding of treatment acceptability. Statistical criteria included the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as the most reliable fit statistic [ 17 26 27 Sample size estimation Determining the sample size for the FIMIX-PLS model presents a challenge due to the method’s complexity and lack of concrete guidelines. There is no fixed minimum sample size for a latent class analysis as it depends on the condition studied, the quality of indicator variables included in the model and how well the classes are separated. However, drawing from previous methodological studies, a sample size in the range of 300–1000 is acceptable, given that fit indices of the model are expected to function adequately [ 28 30 Data structuring Indicators with missing values were case-wise deleted from the data. For our data, there were three cases with missing values, and we excluded them from the final analysis. The case-wise deletion was chosen because the mean value replacement is not recommended for use in FIMIX-PLS. It may generate artificial segments [ 19 31 32 Results Descriptives Table 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0331110.t001 Table 1 Participant Demographic Characteristics.

Entire sample For the entire sample, all hypothesized direct relationships were positive and statistically significant. A positive Affective Attitude significantly influenced Intervention Coherence (β = .577, p < 0.001), Perceived Effectiveness (β = .174, p < 0.01), and Self-Efficacy (β = .573,p < .001). Similarly, Intervention Coherence positively predicted both Perceived Effectiveness (β = .201, p < 0.01) and Self-Efficacy (β = .573, p < 0.001). Finally, Self-Efficacy demonstrated a significant positive effect on Perceived Effectiveness (β = .198, p < .01). Segment 1 A notably strong positive path was observed from Affective Attitude to Perceived Effectiveness (β = .845, p < 0.001), indicating that for individuals in this segment, positive emotional responses are a primary driver of their belief in the intervention’s effectiveness. While Affective Attitude also strongly influenced Intervention Coherence (β = .654, p < 0.001) and Intervention Coherence positively predicted Self-Efficacy (β = .526, p < 0.001), the direct relationship between Intervention Coherence and Perceived Effectiveness was negative (β=−.336, p < .001). Self-Efficacy continued to positively influence Perceived Effectiveness (β = .248, p < 0.001). Segment 2 Intervention Coherence emerged as the strongest direct predictor of Perceived Effectiveness (β = .707, p < 0.001), highlighting the critical role of cognitive understanding in shaping their belief in the intervention’s efficacy. Interestingly, the direct path from Affective Attitude to Perceived Effectiveness was significantly negative (β=−.424, p < 0.001), suggesting that positive feelings alone do not directly lead to Perceived Effectiveness in this group, and may even have a counter-intuitive direct effect when other factors are considered. Other relationships remained robust: Affective Attitude positively influenced Intervention Coherence (β = .532, p < 0.001), and Intervention Coherence strongly predicted Self-Efficacy (β = .625, p < 0.001). Self-Efficacy also maintained a positive influence on Perceived Effectiveness (β = .235, p < 0.01). Model explanation Comparing the cell counts, we found that the best match was achieved when respondents who were not receiving vaginal treatment were assigned to POS segment 1 ( n n Fig 3 Fig 4 10.1371/journal.pone.0331110.g003 Fig 3 Path Coefficients and Outer Loadings for Segment 1. 10.1371/journal.pone.0331110.g004 Fig 4 Path Coefficients and Outer Loadings for Segment 2. Discussion Our analysis identified two latent segments of treatment acceptability for vaginal dosage forms among peri- and postmenopausal women. The first segment was observed among women who never used a vaginal dosage form for symptom management. Patients in this group were mainly concerned about the overall expected comfort level with the use of vaginal treatments. The second segment was observed among women who were currently using or had recent experience using vaginal treatments. Patients in this group were mainly concerned about the extent to which they understood their treatment and how it worked. This confirms what Sekhon and colleagues have proposed in their development of the TFA that the measurement of intervention acceptability should distinguish between anticipated and experienced acceptability [ 25 The model showed a significant positive correlation between intervention coherence and perceived effectiveness among patients with previous use of vaginal treatments. It was suggested that a patient’s previous experiences and beliefs about treatment can be an influential factor in the patient’s decision-making, independent of her received information about the effectiveness of the treatments [ 35 5 36 On the other hand, how a patient feels about her treatment and her anticipated level of comfort or burden are driven by her choice of treatment. In our study, we concluded that for women who were not engaged in vaginal treatments, their beliefs were driven by their affective attitude toward the treatment. We emphasize that patients’ involvement in treatment decision-making could greatly improve their acceptance of using a vaginal treatment. Acceptability may be influenced by vaginal practices that differ cross-culturally and involve a level of comfort with touching the genital areas [ 5 37 Assessment of acceptability from a temporal perspective (pre- vs post-intervention) could be a factor that influences a patient’s willingness to try a vaginal dosage form. It has been proposed that the perception of acceptability is a dynamic concept that could change with the experience of the treatment [ 38 39 40 35 The study’s generalizability is limited by its cross-sectional design and reliance on patient-reported data, which may introduce respondent and recall bias. Cultural and background differences can have a significant impact on how people perceive different aspects of their treatments and, therefore caution is warranted when attempting to extrapolate the study’s conclusions to populations that may possess distinct cultural or demographic characteristics. Additionally, the use of purposive sampling, may further limit the generalizability of the findings to the broader population with distinct characteristics. Study implications Many important gaps in research on the acceptability of vaginal treatments among perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with GSM remain unaddressed. Many social and cultural factors have contributed to these gaps being neglected and not an area of research focus. Despite the many studies that examined different aspects of the acceptability of vaginal dosage forms, studies among menopausal women have not yet received much attention. The validated FIMIX-PLS model provided the optimal approach to understanding unobserved heterogeneity between users of vaginal treatments. The model identified differences in acceptability between current/former and naïve users. Identification of different segments of perceived effectiveness within this population and the factors that predict and mediate them emphasizes the importance of the patient’s informed choice of vaginal treatment. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the complex relationships between these predictors and mediators that shape menopausal women’s perception and acceptance of their treatments. This shall inform healthcare policies and clinical guidelines on the importance of incorporating factors influencing the acceptability of vaginal treatments among menopausal women. The model serves as a valuable benchmark and reference for healthcare professionals, especially pharmacists, advocating for a more patient-centred perspective and emphasizing the importance of sociocultural variations in women’s perceptions of vaginal treatments. On the patient level, the findings raise awareness about the challenges faced by menopausal women regarding their treatment options. Addressing the acceptability of vaginal treatments shall help reduce the stigma and burden and empower patients in their treatment decisions. Conclusion For many urogenital conditions, vaginal drug delivery remains one of the most efficient routes, with many advantages over other routes of administration. Unlike other routes that require negligible effort, the application of, adherence to, and satisfaction with vaginal treatment can cause cognitive and physical distress to the patient. Therefore, a woman’s acceptance of vaginal treatment cannot be overlooked. It is important to understand the aspects related to and factors influencing a woman’s willingness to use vaginal treatments. Clinical guidelines remain silent on most of these aspects. A great research area of focus should be directed toward exploring sociocultural variations in beliefs, perceptions, and barriers to using vaginal treatments in an attempt to enhance women’s acceptability.
