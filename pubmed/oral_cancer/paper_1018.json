In contrast to conventional fabrication approaches, printing technologies enable precise spatial control, design versatility, and seamless integration with complex biological interfaces. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the progress in printable soft conductive materials, with a particular emphasis on the composition, processing, and functional roles of conductive hydrogels and elastomers. This review first introduces traditional fabrication methods for conductive materials and explains the motivation for using printing techniques. We then introduce two major classes of soft conductive materials, hydrogels and elastomers, and describe their applications in both in vitro systems, such as biosensors and soft stimulators, and in vivo settings, including neural interfaces and implantable devices. Finally, we discuss current challenges and propose future directions for advancing printed soft bioelectronics toward clinical translation. 3D printing conductivity hydrogels elastomers China Scholarship Council scholarship Scientific Research Start-up Fund for Recruited Talents at Nantong University The authors acknowledge the support from a China Scholarship Council scholarship (Z.L.) and the Scientific Research Start-up Fund for Recruited Talents at Nantong University (Z.L.). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Flexible conductive materials have garnered significant and growing interest in the field of bioelectronics, primarily due to their intrinsic mechanical properties, such as softness, stretchability, and adaptability, which closely resemble those of biological tissues, including resiliency and structural stability under a certain level of pressure [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 9 10 Traditionally, flexible conductive materials have been fabricated by incorporating conductive fillers into soft polymer matrices [ 11 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 In response to these limitations, recent years have witnessed the rapid emergence of advanced printing technologies for the fabrication of flexible conductive materials. Techniques such as extrusion-based three-dimensional printing, inkjet printing, and digital light processing have enabled precise control over material placement, layer thickness, and structural geometry [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Among the various categories of soft materials used for bioelectronic applications, hydrogels and elastomers have received particular attention due to their mechanical characteristics and biological relevance [ 2 27 9 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 This review begins by introducing the conventional strategies for fabricating flexible conductive materials, with a focus on conductive filler incorporation into soft polymer matrices. The conductive fillers that can be utilized include carbon-based fillers, such as carbon black, graphene, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [ 42 43 44 2. Fabrication of Conductive Soft Materials Nanoparticles and nanomaterials have garnered substantial interest in recent years due to their unique physicochemical properties and diverse applications in areas such as drug delivery [ 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 11 63 Figure 1 11 11 32 64 65 66 67 + + 3+ 3+ 68 Figure 1 69 Figure 1 27 However, these methods often lack the capability for precise spatial control and complex structural customization, which limits their utility in emerging biomedical applications. Several limitations exist in terms of scalability, uniform dispersion, and difficulty in mass production. In this context, 3D-printing technologies offer a powerful alternative, enabling programmable fabrication with high resolution, tunable architecture, and seamless integration of multifunctional materials [ 70 3. Significance of Printing Techniques Although significant progress has been made in the development of conductive soft materials, their widespread implementation in real-life applications still faces considerable challenges. At present, most conductive soft materials used in daily life rely on conventional micro- and nano-fabrication techniques, which often limit their accessibility and scalability. The emergence of 3D printing and other advanced printing techniques has provided a more practical and versatile approach, enabling these materials to be more easily integrated into everyday technologies, particularly in biomedical applications [ 71 72 The introduction of printing techniques into conductive flexible materials has several advantages, which mainly contributes to the development of a wide range of wearable and flexible electronic devices for numerous applications ( Figure 2 41 73 74 75 76 77 Secondly, printing techniques are more conducive to flexible devices than the conventional fabrication methods due to the use of compliant substrates. Recently, a number of filaments or inks with conductive and flexible properties are easily available [ 63 78 79 80 Thirdly, printing techniques extend customized design options using conductive flexible materials, such as carbon-based materials [ 81 Fourthly, printing techniques increase the number of options for component materials. For example, the equipment for the microfabrication methods is optimized for commonly used materials, which makes it difficult to attempt novel combinations of materials. However, with current printing techniques, when we focus on conductive flexible materials, it is possible to select commercial products or to produce customized filaments using a mixture of proper pellets to enhance electrical conductivity and structural elasticity [ 82 83 84 85 For these reasons, various printing techniques are being developed for biomedical applications [ 86 87 4. Application of Printed Conductive Elastomers In Vitro Among conductive soft materials, conductive elastomers stand out due to their unique combination of electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility, making them ideal candidates for biomedical applications where conformability to soft tissue and long-term biocompatibility are required. When combined with emerging fabrication technologies, such as 3D printing, these materials can be precisely patterned into complex geometries that support functional integration with biological environments. Combining conductive elastomers with precise fabrication strategies allows for applications in both in vitro and in vivo settings. We first examine in vitro applications, particularly the development of wearable devices, flexible bioelectronic systems, and soft interfaces for physiological monitoring. In vitro studies are defined as scientific research on biological components outside a living organism and under artificially controlled environments. The role of materials consisting of these controlled conditions is crucial to clarify the behaviors of biological components represented by cells, tissues, and other biological molecules. To create highly controlled environments with affordable materials, printing technologies can be an effective option compared to the conventional fabrication methods. For this reason, printed conductive elastomers are often utilized in in vitro studies, such as for tissue engineering (while the final application is intended for in vivo implantation, most of the current experimental work remains at the in vitro stage) [ 88 89 90 91 92 Figure 3 Figure 3 93 Figure 3 94 35 Figure 3 95 5. Application of Printed Conductive Elastomers In Vivo In vivo studies aim at scientific discoveries following a series of experiments conducted inside a living organism. In this case, the biological components are not isolated but capable of interacting with other parts of the living organism, which is a key difference from in vitro studies. Even though meticulous ethical considerations are required compared to in vitro studies, in vivo studies are better suitable to comprehend the overall perspective of the nature, consisting of targeted biological components and their surroundings. For these objectives, printed conductive elastomers were developed as multiple types of medical devices, including implantable sensors, artificial muscles, and actuators [ 36 43 72 Figure 3 Figure 4 96 Figure 4 97 Figure 4 98 99 6. Application of Printed Conductive Hydrogels In Vitro Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymeric networks capable of retaining large amounts of water, offering excellent softness, biocompatibility, and tunable mechanical properties [ 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 4 30 108 109 Figure 5 31 Figure 5 110 7. Application of Printed Conductive Hydrogels In Vivo The excellent biocompatibility of hydrogels renders conductive hydrogel materials suitable for implantation in vivo. The incorporation of 3D-printing technologies enables the precise fabrication of conductive hydrogel architectures, allowing for better adaptation to the complexity of physiological environments, which can be represented by the situation where thin and tiny morphologies of tissues need to be carefully taken into account to prevent any negative effects on tissues, followed by the installation of biomedical materials or devices. For example, Zhao et al. developed a conductive bioink, termed BC-CPH, consisting of a phase-separated mixture of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) as the conductive component and hydrophilic polyurethane as the structural matrix ( Figure 6 10 Figure 6 111 8. Discussion Printable conductive hydrogels and elastomers have emerged as key materials for biomedical applications, including tissue engineering, biosensors, and soft bioelectronics. The fabrication of these materials typically involves incorporating conductive components into hydrogel or elastomer precursors, followed by shaping them through advanced printing techniques. This process requires precise control over the formulation and rheological properties to ensure smooth printing, rapid solidification, and structural fidelity. Common strategies include blending conductive fillers, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, or metallic nanoparticles, into polymer matrices, or introducing conductive polymers like polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), or poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) to establish efficient electrical pathways while maintaining mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. At present, the mainstream approach to fabricating these materials involves loading conductive components into the hydrogel or elastomer precursor and then processing them through either extrusion-based printing or photopolymerization-based printing ( Figure 7 Figure 4 Figure 6 The design of printable conductive hydrogels and elastomers must satisfy several essential requirements, including printability, biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and electrical conductivity suitable for the intended application. Printability requires that the material possesses suitable rheological properties, such as shear-thinning behavior for extrusion-based printing, or sufficient crosslinkable groups (e.g., carbon–carbon double bonds) for photopolymerization, to ensure smooth deposition, shape fidelity, and structural stability after printing. Flexibility is particularly important for matching the mechanical properties of soft tissues, while incorporated conductive fillers provide the electrical functionality. Moreover, ensuring biocompatibility is critical, as these materials are often intended for direct contact with living tissues and must maintain cell viability, minimize immune response, and exhibit long-term stability in physiological environments. In the current research landscape, there is no strict pursuit of maximizing flexibility or conductivity after printing. Instead, these properties are optimized based on specific application scenarios. For example, a hydrogel-based electrode applied to the surface of a beating heart only needs to generate stable electrical signals for real-time monitoring rather than achieving the highest possible conductivity or stretchability. Hydrogel matrices commonly used for these applications include poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), alginate, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), all of which provide a water-rich environment and tunable physicochemical properties. Elastomeric matrices, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyurethane (PU), and silicone-based networks, are frequently employed due to their inherent softness and stretchability. By carefully balancing these factors, such as printability, biocompatibility, mechanical compliance, and electrical performance, researchers are developing advanced conductive hydrogels and elastomers that hold promise for next-generation biomedical technologies, including implantable bioelectronic devices, functional tissue scaffolds, and real-time physiological monitoring systems. Future research on printed conductive hydrogels and elastomers should focus on improving printing precision to enable complex and patient-specific designs. Enhancing long-term stability under physiological conditions and achieving a better balance between printability, flexibility, conductivity, and biocompatibility are also critical. Additionally, integrating functionalities, such as self-healing and biodegradability, along with establishing standardized evaluation methods, will be key to advancing clinical applications. 9. Conclusions Printable soft conductive materials represent a significant advancement in the field of bioelectronics, as they uniquely combine mechanical compliance, electrical functionality, and fabrication adaptability. Among soft conductive materials, hydrogels and elastomers constitute two major classes with complementary characteristics. Hydrogels provide a hydrated and biocompatible environment suitable for cell interaction and integration, while elastomers contribute excellent elasticity, durability, and mechanical resilience. By addressing the inherent limitations of traditional bulk manufacturing methods, printing technologies offer precise spatial control, the ability to construct complex structures, and enhanced compatibility with biological systems. These capabilities are essential for the development of next-generation wearable and implantable bioelectronic devices. Despite the substantial progress achieved in this field, several challenges remain. These include the optimization of conductivity–mechanical property trade-offs, ensuring long-term biocompatibility and stability in vivo, and addressing the complex clinical and regulatory requirements. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration among materials science, bioengineering, and advanced manufacturing will be essential to fully realize the translational and clinical potential of printed soft bioelectronic systems.
