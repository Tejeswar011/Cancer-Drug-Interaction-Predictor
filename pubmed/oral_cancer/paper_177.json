While tumor immunotherapy has achieved remarkable progress in many hematological malignancies, its efficacy remains limited by key challenges, including the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors, metabolic abnormalities, and drug resistance. As a central mechanism underlying impaired immune function, metabolic reprogramming of immune cells has emerged as a pivotal focus for unraveling tumor immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Advances in metagenomics have highlighted the significance of the human commensal microbiome as a ‘second genome.’ Microbial metabolites, whether circulating systemically or accumulating locally, serve as key messengers linking the microbiota to tumor immunometabolism. This review comprehensively examines the regulatory roles and metabolic mechanisms through which microbial metabolites—including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, tryptophan metabolites, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)—modulate tumor immunity and immunotherapeutic responses via immune cell metabolism. These metabolites shape the tumor immune microenvironment and influence immunotherapeutic efficacy by reprogramming immune cell metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. This review underscores the central regulatory role of microbial metabolites as the ‘second genome’ in tumor immunometabolism, offering a theoretical foundation and potential targets to elucidate mechanisms of immunotherapeutic resistance and advance microbiota metabolism-based precision interventions. microbial metabolites tumor immunity immunometabolism tumor microenvironment immunotherapy The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Microbial Immunology 1 Introduction From the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, William Coley ( 1 2 Bacillus Calmette-Guérin 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 + 14 15 16 17 18 19 The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies in the early 21st century enabled comprehensive metagenomic analyses, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, to characterize the human commensal microbiome. These developments initiated the “second genome” concept and established microbiome research as a distinct scientific discipline ( 20 21 22 23 24 Akkermansia muciniphila Parabacteroides distasonis 25 26 27 27 28 29 30 31 2 The central role of metabolism in shaping immune cell fate and function The efficacy of immune responses fundamentally depends on both the abundance and functional competence of immune cells. Compromised immune cell function significantly impairs immune surveillance, promoting tumor immune evasion and contributing to immunotherapy resistance. Immunometabolism research examines the bidirectional relationship between metabolic pathways (including OXPHOS and glycolysis) and immune cell function, while also investigating how immune cells regulate tissue-specific metabolic homeostasis ( 32 33 2.1 Metabolic substrates: the energy and biosynthetic foundation of immune cell function Immune cells, like all human cells, require continuous energy metabolism and biosynthetic precursors to sustain their viability and functional capacity. This demand is met through the integrated operation of complex metabolic networks. ATP serves as the fundamental energy currency that drives essential immune cell activities including migration, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion. For instance, T cell migration to inflammatory sites following activation depends on ATP-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling, where actin-myosin interactions facilitate cellular movement ( 18 34 35 The availability of biosynthetic precursors is equally vital for supporting immune cell proliferation and effector functions. During immune activation, the clonal expansion of lymphocytes requires rapid biosynthesis of macromolecules including nucleic acids, proteins, and membrane constituents. This process critically depends on several interconnected metabolic pathways: De novo 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 18 2.2 Immune cell metabolic reprogramming: core hub for regulating immune responses and cell fate The plasticity of immune cell metabolism is a fundamental mechanism that not only enables immune cells to adapt to different functional states but also allows them to actively regulate immune responses. Metabolic reprogramming supplies energy and biosynthetic precursors for immune cells and directly influences cell differentiation and function by regulating signal transduction, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression. In T cells, upon activation, effector T cells (Teff) rapidly upregulate glycolysis to meet the demands of proliferation and the synthesis of effector molecules. During this process, the costimulatory CD28 signal promotes the expression of the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform via the Ars2 protein, thereby enhancing glycolytic flux. Furthermore, the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH functions as an RNA-binding protein: when glycolysis is active, it binds to the 3’UTR of IFN-γ mRNA to inhibit its translation, but dissociates under glucose restriction to promote IFN-γ production, thereby constituting a dynamic “metabolism-translation” switch ( 43 44 45 45 46 46 Under normal physiological conditions, distinct metabolic characteristics define the functional properties of various immune cell subsets. For instance, regulatory T cells (Tregs) primarily rely on OXPHOS and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to maintain their suppressive function ( 47 48 47 49 50 51 51 46 52 3 Regulation of microbial metabolites on tumor immunity and immunotherapy A growing body of clinical and experimental evidence has underscored the pivotal role of the microbiota in tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic responses. First, significant differences in the composition and functional profiles of microbial communities have been identified between cancer patients and healthy individuals across multiple niches, including the gut, tumor tissues, blood, and adjacent normal tissues ( 53 55 56 57 58 59 53 49 60 61 62 in vitro Akkermansia Akkermansia 63 64 3.1 Short-chain fatty acids SCFAs primarily consisting of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, represent a crucial class of metabolites generated by gut microbiota through the catabolism of complex carbohydrates such as dietary fiber ( 65 66 67 68 69 s 70 Escherichia coli 71 72 73 74 75 + 76 Numerous studies ( 77 78  Table 1 + + 79 80 81 82 Table 1 Overview of short-chain fatty acids on immune cells.

Microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites (e.g., IAA, IPA, 3-IAld, indole-3-lactic acid) contribute to disease processes through multiple pathways: IAA ameliorates precancerous intestinal inflammation and modulates the microbiota via IL-35; metabolites derived from Bifidobacterium Akkermansia Bacteroides + Diagram illustrating the interactions between gut inflammation, immune cells, and microbiota. Gut inflammation activates Treg and macrophages, influencing IL-22 and AKT, which impact AhR activity. Microbial metabolites, such as 3-IAld, ILA, IAA, L-Trp, IPA, and Kynurenine, interact with AhR and immune responses. Various bacteria, including Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia, modulate these metabolites. Dysbiosis can affect Trp metabolism, impacting immune responses via IL-35, IFN-γ, CAR-T cells, and CD8+ T cells, ultimately influencing tumor cells. 3.4 Lipopolysaccharides LPS, essential structural components of Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes, are released into the host environment during microbial growth, division, and lysis. As highly bioactive molecules, LPS serves as a potent signaling mediator that significantly modulates both physiological and pathological host states. Given its critical role in microbe-host crosstalk, LPS is frequently classified among biologically significant “microbiota-derived metabolites” or “microbe-associated molecular patterns” ( 118 119 Bacteroidetes 120 121 122 Lactobacillus plantarum 123 125 4 Metabolic reprogramming of tumor-associated immune cells by microbiota-derived metabolites: mechanisms and therapeutic implications Drawing upon established knowledge of metabolic control in immune cell function and the immunomodulatory capacity of microbiota metabolites in tumor immunity, this review examines the specific metabolic pathways through which microbial metabolites influence immune cell antitumor activity. We focus on critical pathways including glycolysis, OXPHOS, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Elucidating how microbiota metabolites reprogram these interconnected metabolic networks in immune cells will provide deeper mechanistic understanding of microbial immunomodulation while revealing novel therapeutic targets to address immunotherapy resistance. These insights may further guide the development of microbiota-based approaches to enhance metabolic fitness and improve clinical outcomes in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we systematically compare the mechanisms by which these metabolites regulate immune cell metabolism, focusing on their functional characteristics and potential therapeutic applications in anti-tumor immunity. 4.1 Short-chain fatty acids: synergistic regulation of immune cell metabolism and function via multiple mechanisms SCFAs—primarily acetate, propionate, and butyrate—are produced by the anaerobic fermentation of dietary fiber by the intestinal microbiota. They exert their effects through multiple mechanisms: acting as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors to modulate gene expression epigenetically; serving as ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, GPR43, GPR41, and GPR109A) to initiate downstream signaling; and functioning as metabolic substrates that are directly integrated into cellular metabolic pathways to alter the metabolic state of immune cells. In regulatory lymphocytes, SCFAs promote the expression of anti-inflammatory factors by enhancing glycolysis. For example, pentanoate upregulates hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression in B cells to enhance glycolytic flux, thereby promoting IL-10 secretion ( 126 + 127 128 SCFAs also play critical roles in innate immune cells. Butyrate inhibits glycolysis in DCs by activating GPCRs and upregulating HIF-1α, thereby attenuating their inflammatory activation ( 129 130 + + 131 + 132  Figure 2 Figure 2 Effects of various short-chain fatty acids on immune cells. SCFAs exert pleiotropic regulatory effects on immune cells: Sodium acetate activates PPARγ to mitigate macrophage inflammation, whereas high-dose acetate suppresses macrophage glycolysis and immune responses by impacting HIF-1α activation and protein acetylation. Butyrate upregulates Glut1 to modulate Th1 cell metabolism, promoting GzmB expression; it also enhances CD8 + + Metabolic pathways diagram detailing acetate, butyrate, and pentanoate roles in immune cell functions. Links show interactions involving glycolysis, lipid oxidation, and glutamine metabolism, affecting CD4⁺, CD8⁺ T cells, macrophages, NK cells, and others. Key components include PPARγ, HIF-1α, Glut1, and mTOR, with effects on cytokine production and cellular responses. 4.2 Tryptophan metabolites: context-dependent immunometabolic regulation centered on the AhR signaling axis Tryptophan metabolites constitute a critical interface between the microbiota and host immunity, and the balance or dysregulation of their metabolic pathways significantly influences anti-tumor immunity. Tryptophan is metabolized primarily through three pathways: the kynurenine pathway, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) pathway, and the microbial indole derivative pathway ( 104 133 134 135 136 Indole compounds produced by microbial metabolism, such as indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3A), ILA, and indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), regulate immune responses primarily through the activation of the AhR (  Figure 3 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 Figure 3 Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor by microbial tryptophan metabolites. Tryptophan-derived microbiota metabolites exhibit diverse effects on AhR activation: Indole, generated from tryptophan metabolism by Lactobacillus Fusobacterium nucleatum Lactobacillus + Limosilactobacillus + Bifidobacterium breve Jianpi Jiedu Decoction + Diagram illustrating interactions between Trp metabolism and the AhR pathway. Metabolites like Kynurenine, I3A, IC, ILA, and 3-IAld from bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Bifidobacterium influence immune responses, affecting various cells like CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, Th1, Th17 cells, macrophages, and TAMs. These interactions are related to conditions like gut inflammation and tumor cell activity. Notably, AhR ligands from different sources can elicit strikingly divergent immunological outcomes. Metabolites from the kynurenine pathway, typically produced by tumor cells, often promote immunosuppression, whereas microbiota-derived indole derivatives can, in some contexts, enhance anti-tumor immunity. For example, Chang et al. demonstrated that inhibiting the AhR pathway blocks M2 polarization of TAMs, enhances their anti-tumor function, and thereby inhibits colorectal cancer growth ( 144 108 145 + + 146 Parabacteroides distasonis 147 4.3 Bile acids: the immune double-edged sword at the crossroads of metabolism and signal transduction Bile acids are amphipathic molecules synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. Following metabolic modification by the intestinal microbiota, primary bile acids give rise to secondary bile acids, which act as important signaling molecules with complex roles in anti-tumor immunity. Primary bile acids, such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), undergo deconjugation by intestinal bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides Clostridium + + 2+ 2+ 96 + 148 149 A recent study demonstrated that microbiota-derived bile acids drive anti-tumor immunity by antagonizing the host androgen receptor (AR) ( 150 In vivo 4.4 Non-classical metabolites: mechanistic exploration of emerging immunometabolic regulators Beyond traditional metabolites, numerous non-canonical metabolites produced by the microbiota are increasingly recognized for their immunomodulatory functions. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a microbial metabolite derived from choline, carnitine, and related compounds. In triple-negative breast cancer models, TMAO induces caspase-3-mediated cleavage of Gasdermin E (GSDME) by activating the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor PERK, leading to tumor cell pyroptosis. This inflammatory cell death releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and tumor antigens, which potently activate DCs and recruit CD8 + 151 152 5 Conclusion and prospect Tumor immunometabolism has emerged as a crucial regulatory interface integrating the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment with the metabolic function of immune cells, representing a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of current immunotherapies. Microbial metabolites—collectively termed the host’s “second genome”—play a pivotal role in mediating this interaction. Key classes of these metabolites include SCFAs, bile acids, tryptophan derivatives, and other immunomodulatory compounds. Through the targeted modulation of fundamental metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, OXPHOS, and lipid metabolism, these microbial molecules exert precise control over immune cell survival, differentiation, and effector functions. SCFAs exemplify this functional versatility: butyrate, for instance, enhances FAO via CPT1A activation in induced Tregs ( 126 128 82 + 2+ 95 101 147 Despite considerable progress, clinical translation remains challenging due to substantial interindividual heterogeneity in gut microbiota composition, shaped by factors such as diet, age, geography, and comorbidities, as well as the complexity of mechanistic interactions among metabolites. To date, most studies have focused on single metabolites; however, the tumor microenvironment contains a complex mixture of metabolites whose synergistic or antagonistic effects remain poorly understood. Future research should prioritize unraveling the fine-grained regulatory networks governing microbial metabolite-immune cell metabolic crosstalk. Integrating multi-omics approaches—including metagenomics, metabolomics, and single-cell sequencing—will be key to constructing predictive models that link microbial signatures to immune metabolic activity and treatment response. Furthermore, developing innovative delivery systems, such as metabolite-loaded nanocarriers engineered to respond to TME conditions (e.g., low pH or hypoxia), represents a promising direction for precision therapeutic intervention. In summary, microbial metabolites provide deep mechanistic insights and novel therapeutic opportunities for overcoming immunotherapy resistance. Advancing from descriptive studies to targeted metabolic interventions will be essential for ushering in a new era of personalized, combination cancer immunotherapy aimed at improving clinical outcomes and patient quality of life.
