Introduction Intrathecal administration, a method of delivering drugs directly into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ® 19 20 Despite these advancements, there remains insufficient attention to whether pharmaceutical excipients in these formulations are suitable for intrathecal administration and whether incompatibility issues may arise due to the unique physiological environment of the injection site. If these concerns are not adequately addressed, they could pose significant risks [ 21 22 23 24 25 Citric acid and sodium citrate are commonly used pharmaceutical excipients in injectable formulations, primarily serving as pH adjusters, metal ion chelators, and stabilizers to enhance drug stability and solubility and reduce irritability [ 26 27 28 2. Methods and Materials 2.1. Animals ICR mice (6–8 weeks, half male and half female) were acquired from the Medical Center of Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, China) and housed in a stable environment with 23 ± 2 °C temperature, 55 ± 5% humidity, and a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 am) for 7 days before the experiment. Mice ate food and drank water freely. New Zealand rabbits (conventional grade; 2–4 months old; 2.1–2.6 kg body weight) of both sexes (50% male, 50% female) were used in this study. The animals, sourced from Kangda Aibo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Qingdao, China)—an accredited laboratory animal provider (Quality Certification No. 370823240100197621)—were non-transgenic wild-types and serologically confirmed as pathogen-free. All rabbits were individually housed in stainless-steel cages supplemented with environmental enrichment (e.g., toys) under standardized conditions (SOP-AC-087.02, Jiangsu Dingtai Pharmaceutical Research Co., Ltd. Nanjing, China). Animals received commercial diet (Ke’ao Xieli Feed Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) ad libitum. Following a 7-day acclimation period, experimental procedures were initiated. The mice experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of China Pharmaceutical University (Ethics Code 2024-12-040), and the rabbit study proposal was approved by the Ethics Committee of National Institutes for Food and Drug Control with the permit number AP-24121-450N. 2.2. Intrathecal Injection Each mouse was anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China). After the mice were completely anesthetized (the righting reflex was lost and the tail clip did not produce violent movement), the hair on the back of the mice was removed with an electric hair shaver, and the skin on the back of the mice was gently cut with scissors. The needle was inserted vertically into the middle of the most prominent place of the spinal column, and the angle was reduced to approximately 30° after touching the bone, then the needle advanced into the vertebral space at L5–L6. Obvious tail flutter indicates the needle has been successfully inserted into the vertebral space. Drug solutions (1.833, 3.666, 7.332, or 14.664 μg/g citrate equivalents) or saline were intrathecally administered at 520 nL/g via syringe pump over 30 s. The 3.666 μg/g dose represents the human equivalent of 28.2 mg via body surface area conversion. After the injection, the wounds of mice were sutured with absorbable sutures and disinfected with iodophor. Three days later, the mice received a second intrathecal injection. One day prior to the experiment, the dorsal lumbar region of each New Zealand White rabbit was shaved using electric clippers. On the experimental day, anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane and maintained with 3% isoflurane. Under anesthesia, an intrathecal injection was administered between the L5–L6 vertebrae, where test compounds (0.104, 0.292, 1.175, or 3.290 mg/rabbit) or saline (0.1 mL/rabbit) were slowly infused over 5 min before gradual needle withdrawal. For pre-dosing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, approximately 0.5 mL CSF was obtained via cisterna magna puncture using the same anesthesia protocol. Post-dosing CSF collection employed anesthesia through intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (30 mg/kg) and xylazine hydrochloride (3 mg/kg). Following final CSF collection, euthanasia was performed via femoral artery exsanguination. Spinal cord tissue surrounding the injection site and corresponding dorsal root ganglia were harvested, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, then processed through dehydration, paraffin embedding, sectioning, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and coverslipping for histological examination. All formulations maintained physiological osmolarity (293–296 mOsm/kg) and pH (7.3 ± 0.2) through controlled saline/water ratios and citric acid adjustment. 2.3. Behavioral Tests All the mice were habituated to the experimental room 30 min before the test. After each behavioral test, 75% ethanol was used to clean the experimental apparatus. All the tests were performed by a technician blinded to the treatment group, and the data were recorded using the video tracking system (v0.9.11, Jiliang, China). Additionally, we assessed physiological responses and mortality in mice at three time points: immediately post-injection, 1 h, and 24 h after intrathecal administration. 2.3.1. Open Field Test (OFT) The open field activity monitoring system comprehensively assesses locomotor and behavioral activity levels of mice. It is primarily used to assess spontaneous activity levels, anxiety behavior, exploratory behavior, and motor ability of experimental animals [ 29 30 2.3.2. Grid Test (GT) Grid testing can assess an animal’s motor coordination, balance, and movement functions of both front and hind paws, serving as a crucial basis for studying neurological diseases, drug efficacy, and neural injury repair [ 31 32 2.3.3. Hot Place Test (HPT) The Hot Plate Test (HPT) is a method used to evaluate animals’ pain responses to heat stimuli, assessing their pain thresholds and the efficacy of analgesic drugs [ 33 2.4. Immunofluorescence The mouse brains were taken out, respectively, 10 min or 60 min after the second intrathecal injection. Mice were perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 4% paraformaldehyde. Then brains were removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and dehydrated in 30% sucrose for 2 days. For frozen slices, 25 μm or 30 μm coronal sections were sliced on a freezing microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany). After incubating with 10% donkey serum ((SL050, Solarbio Life Science, Beijing, China), the brain slices were incubated in rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:400, 226008, Synaptic Systems, Germany) in a refrigerator at 4 °C overnight. After the incubation of primary antibody, the brain slices were washed in PBS 3 times for 5 min each time. Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, 33106ES60, Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was selected as the second antibody and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 h. After the second antibody incubation, the brain slices were washed in PBS 3 times, 5 min each time. Then the DAPI solution (C0065, Solarbio Life Science, China) was incubated to stain nuclei in the dark at room temperature for 5 min. All immunofluorescent images were obtained by fluorescence microscope (DM2000, Lecia, Wetzlar, Germany). Then, the cell staining was counted using Leica Application Suite X software by an individual experimenter blind to the experiment. 2.5. Stereotaxic Injection Each mouse was anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and kept anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane. Then the mouse was positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, America). The calcium indicator adeno-associated virus vector (AAV-hSyn-GCamp6s, BrainVTA, Wuhan, China) carrying gene coding at a volume of 200 nL was microinfused into the target regions at a flow rate of 50 nL/min with a microinjection pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). The microliter syringe (Gaoge, Shanghai, China) was left at the injection site for 5 min to ensure spreading virus totally after the microinjection. The coordinates of brain region were as follows: AP 1.78 mm, ML ±0.30 mm, DV −2.35 mm. AP, ML, and DV, successively represented the anterior–posterior, medial–lateral, and dorsal–ventral positions relative to the bregma. 2.6. Fiber Photometry Fiber photometry is a novel optogenetic method for recording neural activity in vivo. It enables in vivo neural activity recording by transforming cellular calcium concentration fluctuations into detectable fluorescent signals. These signals are then captured by the fiber photometry system, allowing for real-time observation of neural activity [ 34 0 0 0 0 2.7.

Intrathecal Injection of Citric Acid/Sodium Citrate (SC) Causes Hind Limb Injury in Mice To better simulate clinical drug administration scenarios, we adopted a repeated dosing regimen, administering a second dose to the mice three days after the initial injection. Following two intrathecal administrations of citric acid/sodium citrate (SC) at graded concentrations (1.833, 3.666, 7.332 μg/g) or equivalent-volume saline (n = 20/group) over 48 h, comprehensive neurobehavioral assessments were conducted using standardized paradigms: the Open Field Test (OFT; 5 min observation in 50 × 50 cm arena), Grip Traction Test (GT), and Hot Plate Test (HPT; 55 ± 0.5 °C). The quantitative analysis revealed dose-dependent neurofunctional impairments in both sensorimotor domains ( Figure 1 In Open Field Test evaluations, the 7.332 μg/g SC group showed significantly reduced locomotor activity, with a 45.7% decrease in the total movement distance and a 47.8% reduction in the average velocity compared to normal controls ( p Figure 1 p p p Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. Intrathecal Injection Induces Dose-Dependent Behavioral Responses in Mice We evaluated the mice at three time points: during each administration (Imm.), 1 h post-administration, and 24 h post-administration. Observations included the tail twisting, convulsions, hindlimb rigidity, hindlimb weakness, locomotor abnormality and recovery time, with both the initial number of mice and the survival count also documented, as outlined in Table 1 The experiment revealed a pronounced dose-dependent toxicity. Following the first administration, the 7.332 μg/g dose group exhibited a 30% mortality rate (6/20), while the 14.664 μg/g group experienced 100% mortality (20/20). After the second administration, mortality was observed even at the lower dose of 3.666 μg/g (10%, 2/20), and the 7.332 μg/g group suffered an additional six deaths, resulting in a cumulative mortality rate of 60% (12/20). The time series analysis demonstrated a strong linear correlation between mortality and the dose after the first administration (r = 0.98). Notably, the toxicity was significantly exacerbated upon the repeated administration, particularly at doses exceeding 7.332 μg/g. 3.3. Neurophysiological Response to Intrathecal SC Administration: c-Fos Immunohistochemical Analysis To investigate the temporal dynamics of the neuronal activation following the intrathecal SC administration, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of the c-Fos expression, a well-established marker of neuronal activity, in key brain regions associated with motor control and sensory processing. Our time-course evaluation revealed a biphasic modulation of neuronal activation patterns. At the acute phase (10 min post-injection), we observed a significant suppression of neuronal activity, as evidenced by reduced c-Fos+ cell counts in both the prelimbic cortex (PrL) and the infralimbic cortex (IL) ( p p Figure 2 These temporal patterns of neuronal activation demonstrate that the intrathecal SC administration induces a biphasic neuromodulatory effect, characterized by an initial inhibitory phase followed by delayed neuronal excitation. The differential activation patterns across distinct cortical regions (PrL, IL, and M2) suggest a region-specific sensitivity to the SC modulation, potentially reflecting the compound’s complex pharmacological actions on neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration. 3.4. Fiber Photometry Reveals Biphasic Modulation of PrL Neuronal Activity Following Intrathecal SC Administration To investigate whether the intrathecal SC administration affects neuronal activity through calcium ion chelation mechanisms, we employed fiber photometry to monitor real-time calcium dynamics in the prelimbic cortex (PrL). It is known that the vicinal diol group in SC’s structure exhibits a strong metal ion chelating capability [ 35 2+ 2+ 36 37 Adult C57BL/6 mice were stereotaxically injected with AAV-hSyn-GCaMP6s into the PrL to enable genetically encoded Ca 2+ The neuronal activity was recorded during two critical time windows (0–10 min and 60–70 min post-injection) following the second intrathecal SC administration to evaluate both acute and delayed responses. As shown in Figure 3 p p 2+ 2+ This temporal pattern suggests multifaceted SC actions on cortical circuits, potentially mediated through the following: (1) immediate receptor-mediated inhibition, (2) secondary network-level disinhibition [ 38 39 Figure 2 3.5. Post-Intrathecal Administration Clinical Phenotypes in Rabbit Models In order to validate the dose-dependent neuromodulatory effects observed in murine models and assess their relevance in a species with a closer neuroanatomical and pharmacokinetic resemblance to humans, we further conducted parallel experiments in rabbit models. In this investigation, four intrathecal sodium citrate dose groups were established in rabbits: 0.104, 0.292, 1.175, and 3.290 mg/rabbit (n = 6 per group, equal gender distribution). Rabbits in the lower-dose cohorts (0.104 and 0.292 mg/rabbit) demonstrated no observable abnormalities ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Notably, the observed neurological symptoms were self-limiting within 1–2 h post-administration, mirroring the transient nature of clinical adverse events. The biochemical analysis revealed marked alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) calcium and magnesium levels at the 3.290 mg/rabbit dosage, suggesting that citrate’s metal-chelating properties may contribute to these neurological disturbances. Further details regarding the detection methods, methodological validation, and complete results are provided in the Supplementary Materials 40 41 The histopathological evaluation of administration sites across all dose groups showed no evidence of local tissue damage or structural abnormalities (HE-stained spinal cord sections of New Zealand rabbits were provided in Supplementary Figure S1 4. Discussion Our experimental data establish that sodium citrate induces concentration-dependent neurotoxicity in intrathecal administration models. We observed a robust correlation between the citrate concentration and neurological deficits in the lumbosacral region, paralleled by cerebrospinal fluid calcium depletion and motor neuron viability loss. These effects demonstrate a causal mechanistic relationship between citrate’s high-affinity calcium chelation (Kd = 2.1 nM at physiological pH) and the neural injury. These findings reveal previously unrecognized molecular mechanisms of neural vulnerability mediated through calcium chelation dynamics [ 3 42 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics17091112/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.W. and H.S.; Methodology, Y.Z., Q.H., Y.D., X.T., X.Z.
