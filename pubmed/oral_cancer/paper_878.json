Introduction Sugmel-3 is a classical prescription in traditional Mongolian medicine, originally recorded in the seminal medical text The Four Tantras rGyud-bzhi Amomum kravanh Cuminum cyminum Piper longum 1 10 18 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Advancements in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) have enabled the direct, label-free visualization of small molecules in tissue sections with high spatial resolution [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 In addition to confirming its brain penetration, our previous research also showed that 1,8-Cineole improves sleep by modulating the levels of key neurotransmitters—namely serotonin (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)—in both serum and brain tissue [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 The present study aims to comprehensively map the spatiotemporal distribution of 1,8-Cineole and its potential metabolites in the brain using AFADESI-MSI. By integrating spatial metabolomics with neuropharmacological analysis, we seek to reveal how 1,8-Cineole influences the distribution and dynamics of critical neurotransmitters, such as 5-HT and GABA, and their biosynthetic and metabolic products in specific brain regions. The research strategy is shown in Scheme 1 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemicals and Reagents HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased from Merck (Muskegon, MI, USA). Purified water was purchased from Wahaha (Hangzhou, China). 1,8-Cineole was purchased from Shanghai Acmec Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), with a purity of 99%. CAS:470-82-6. Diethyl ether was purchased from Sinopharm (Beijing, China). HPLC-grade anhydrous ethanol was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). A hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining kit and Neutral Balsam were purchased from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Xylene and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). 2.2. Animal Experiments The animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Inner Mongolia University (approval number YKD2015040; approval date April 2015). Six-week-old male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing 180–200 g were procured from SPF (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Animals were acclimatized for 3–4 days after purchase and housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle with controlled temperature (23 ± 3 °C) and humidity (40–70%). Rats were given a standard laboratory diet and water ad libitum (all met experimental animal health requirements). SD rats were randomly divided into two groups, consisting of a control group ( n n The Four Tantras 2.3. Sample Preparation for AFADESI-MSI Analysis Brain tissue was embedded with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Leica, Germany) and sectioned into 10 μm thick sagittal sections using a cryostat microtome (Leica CM 1860, Leica Microsystem, Wetzlar, Germany), and the brain slices were thaw-mounted on a positively charged microscope slide (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C. To maintain consistency of brain tissue sections, sagittal sections were cut within a maximum of 1 mm along the sagittal suture to ensure that the pineal gland was included. All brain sections were dried in a vacuum drying chamber for 20 min before MSI analysis. Moreover, an adjacent brain section was obtained for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Localization of brain microregions is performed by matching them to adjacent stained brain sections to ensure the microregional consistency of each brain tissue section. 2.4. AFADESI-MSI Analysis of Brain Tissue Sections After vacuum-drying, the sections were analyzed using an AFADESI-MSI system equipped with a lab-made AFADESI ion source and a Q-OT-qIT hybrid mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). The parameters of the mass spectrometer were optimized accordingly, and they are summarized in Table S1 2 v v 2.5. Data Processing and Statistical Analysis Raw data files (.raw format) generated from AFADESI-MSI were initially imported into Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The files were then converted to the common data format (.cdf). Subsequent image processing and reconstruction were conducted using MassImager 2.0 software (Beijing, China). Reconstructed ion images underwent background subtraction. The co-registration of MSI data with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images was then performed to precisely align molecular distributions with histological features. Following visual confirmation of this registration, regions of interest (ROIs) were manually delineated on the images. The average ion intensity within each ROI was calculated and subsequently exported as a text file (.txt), generating a two-dimensional data matrix comprising mass-to-charge ratios ( m/z For univariate comparisons, independent-sample t p https://hiplot.com.cn/ 2.6. Histopathological Staining The tissue morphological information was revealed on sister sections of the ones for MS imaging using standard hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E staining). All the reagents used for staining were from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). After the sections were dried, toluene was applied and the slides were covered with glass coverslips. Stained brain tissue sections were scanned using a digital section scanner (Ningbo Jiangfeng Bioinformatics Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China). 2.7. LC–MS/MS Analysis The LC-MS/MS analysis of brain tissue homogenates was performed in positive and negative ionization modes using a Q-OT-qIT hybrid mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) connected to an UltiMate 3000 series HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The detailed sample preparation process and instrument parameters for LC-MS/MS analysis are provided in the Supplementary Materials 2.8. Metabolite Identification Metabolite structures were putatively identified following established protocols [ 32 http://hmdb.ca/ 33 www.lipidmaps.org 34 http://metlin.scripps.edu/ 35 36 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Mapping the Drug and Endogenous Metabolites in the Rat Brain AFADESI-MSI is a powerful technique for visualizing the spatial distribution of compounds within tissue sections, particularly suitable for simultaneously analyzing exogenous compounds and their impact on the endogenous metabolic network [ 37 Figure 1 m /z m/z m/z m/z m/z m/z m/z m/z m/z m/z m/z m/z + Supplementary Table S2 Figure 1 Figure 1 Next, we validated the capability of the AFADESI-MSI technique to detect the exogenously administered compound. The results showed that both the parent drug, 1,8-Cineole, and its major metabolite, 2-hydroxy-1,8-Cineole, were successfully detected in the brain sections of the administered rats (positive ion mode). The identities of these two compounds were confirmed by accurate mass measurements ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 In summary, the results from the first part of this study clearly demonstrate that the AFADESI-MSI technique can be effectively applied to rat brain tissue analysis. It not only allows for the simultaneous detection and localization of various endogenous neurotransmitters and metabolites but also accurately identifies exogenous drugs and their metabolites, revealing their spatial distribution characteristics within the brain. The comparison of distribution patterns between the representative substances, 5-HT and 1,8-Cineole, preliminarily highlights the significant differences in brain distribution (especially regarding gray/white matter partitioning) between endogenous polar molecules and exogenous lipophilic molecules. This lays the foundation for subsequent in-depth exploration of the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of 1,8-Cineole and its metabolites, as well as their potential impact on the endogenous neurochemical environment. Analysis of the distribution of the endogenous neurotransmitter 5-HT ( Figure 1 38 39 40 41 42 Figure 1 43 44 This study clearly demonstrates that the AFADESI-MSI technique can be effectively applied to rat brain tissue analysis. It not only allows for the simultaneous detection and localization of various endogenous neurotransmitters and metabolites but also accurately identifies exogenous drugs and their metabolites, revealing their spatial distribution characteristics within the brain. The comparison of distribution patterns between the representative substances, 5-HT and 1,8-Cineole, preliminarily highlights the significant differences in brain distribution (especially regarding gray/white matter partitioning) between endogenous polar molecules and exogenous lipophilic molecules. This lays the foundation for subsequent in-depth exploration of the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of 1,8-Cineole and its metabolites, as well as their potential impact on the endogenous neurochemical environment. 3.2. Temporo-Spatial Changes in 1,8-Cineole and Its Metabolite in the Brain The Mongolian medicinal formula Sugmel-3 is renowned in traditional Mongolian medicine for effectively treating insomnia. Among the volatile oil components of this formula, only 1,8-Cineole demonstrates the ability to permeate the blood–brain barrier and access the brain. Consequently, informed by preliminary pharmacokinetic data, specific time points were chosen to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of drugs within distinct functional microdomains of the brain. Rat brain tissues from treatment and control groups were collected 5 min, 30 min, 3 h, and 6 h following drug administration and subjected to mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) analysis. As shown in Figure 2 45 46 38 Supplementary Materials, Figure S1 Our findings unequivocally confirm the rapid absorption and efficient BBB penetration of 1,8-Cineole ( Figure 2 47 48 Observing the time-dependent intensity changes of 1,8-Cineole and its metabolite in the whole brain ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure S2A and S3A 49 50 51 Analysis of the total drug exposure, quantified by the area under the curve (AUC) percentage ( Figure 2 52 53 54 55 56 The temporal dynamics further highlighted regional specificities. While T max Figure 2 Figures S2A and S3A T max This study also revealed rapid and extensive metabolism of 1,8-Cineole. The swift appearance (within 5 min) and widespread distribution of the metabolite, 2-hydroxy-1,8-Cineole ( Figure 2 Figure 2 57 58 59 60 Figure 2 61 Figure 2 Figures S2B and S3B In conclusion, this investigation leveraging AFADESI-MSI provides compelling, spatially resolved evidence that 1,8-Cineole effectively penetrates the CNS after oral administration and exhibits marked heterogeneity in its distribution and pharmacokinetic profile across different brain microregions. Regions associated with cognition and sleep regulation, such as the CTX and HP, showed the highest overall exposure (AUC). Both the parent drug and its rapidly formed, persistent metabolite follow distinct spatiotemporal trajectories, with notable accumulation patterns (e.g., parent in CTX/HP, metabolite in PG). These region-specific variations in absorption, distribution, and metabolism are likely crucial determinants of the compound’s efficacy and central effects. In addition, this study further confirmed that the spatiotemporal drug metabolomics technology based on AFADESI-MSI can synchronize the spatial and temporal changes of drugs and their metabolite levels in complex microregions of the brain, which provides powerful technical support for in-depth investigation of the mechanism of drug action in the brain. 3.3. Microregional Regulation of NTs by 1,8-Cineole Our investigation, utilizing AFADESI-MSI, successfully detected and mapped a range of key NTs within distinct brain microregions, including 5-HT, GABA, Glu, glutamine (Gln), histamine, acetylcholine (ACh), and adenosine. This method of focused examination of active metabolites from the untargeted metabolic information offers the benefit of not needing pre-established criteria for identifying metabolites [ 19 62 Serotonin (5-HT), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, is well-established as a key regulator of the sleep–wake cycle [ 63 m/z Figure 3 Figure S4 Figure 4 Figure S4 64 65 66 67 68 69 Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a pivotal inhibitory neurotransmitter (NT) in the central nervous system, and an increase in its concentration can lead to central nervous system depression and promote sleep [ 70 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure S5 71 72 73 Glutamate (Glu), the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, plays a crucial role in maintaining the sleep–wake cycle and cognitive processes [ 74 75 Figures S6 and S7 Figure 4 76 77 Figure S8 78 79 Figure S9 80 Figure S10 81 Figure S11 Figure 4 82 83 m/z Figures S12 and S14 84 Figure S13 Observation of brain microregions exhibiting a high degree of neurotransmitter modulation (PG, HP, CB, CA, CTX) reveals a correlation with the distribution patterns of 1,8-Cineole and its metabolites. Notably, neurotransmitter changes appear more pronounced in regions where 1,8-Cineole and its metabolites are distributed at higher intensities ( Figure 4 3.4. Metabolic Regulation of NTs in Brain Microregions by 1,8-Cineole Intervention Endogenous metabolic changes in tissues and organs can indicate the effects of drug stimulation [ 78 Figure 5 To investigate the metabolic effects of 1,8-Cineole on NTs in brain microregions after the intervention, we performed orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on representative metabolites associated with the NTs pathway. The OPLS-DA score plots showed that the metabolite levels deviated significantly from the pre-dose levels 5 and 30 min after administration, while showing a trend of returning to the pre-dose levels after 3 h to 6 h ( Figure 5 Section 3.2 2 2 2 2 2 Figure 5 2 2 2 Therefore, we selected brain tissue microregions from the control and treatment groups (30 min after drug administration) for clustering heat map analysis ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 85 Section 3.3 The above findings suggest that 1,8-Cineole significantly modulates neurotransmitter metabolic pathways in the brain, including influencing the synthesis and metabolic dynamics of GABA, serotonin, and adenosine systems. In order to further reveal how 1,8-Cineole affects sleep–wake homeostasis by regulating monoamines and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems, the present study continued to focus on the metabolic pathways of serotonin and GABA and analyzed the changes of their key precursors and metabolites. 3.5. Effects of 1,8-Cineole on 5-HT and GABA Metabolic Pathways in Brain Tissue Current research on the mechanism of insomnia indicates that human insomnia is closely related to NTs and related neuroreceptors in the brain [ 86 87 Tryptophan (Trp) serves as the primary precursor for 5-HT synthesis. It is catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) to form 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), which is subsequently decarboxylated by 5-HTP decarboxylase to yield 5-HT [ 88 89 90 91 92 93 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 As can be observed in the spatial distribution maps before drug administration and after 30 min of 1,8-Cineole intervention ( Figure 6 Table S3 Table S4 Existing evidence indicates that Gln serves as a common precursor for the biosynthesis of Glu and GABA and that neurons rely on a stable supply of Gln to produce these neurotransmitters [ 75 94 95 In terms of GABA metabolism and biosynthesis, we found that GABA was significantly up-regulated 2.06-fold after 30 min ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Table S3 This suggests that Sugmel-3′s therapeutic profile in treating insomnia may be associated with the observed changes in neurotransmitters across brain regions following 1,8-Cineole administration, particularly the alterations in the synthesis and metabolism of 5-HT and GABA, thereby correlating with sedative–hypnotic efficacy. The comprehensive upregulation of the 5-HT pathway, from its initial precursor Trp to the crucial sleep-regulating hormone melatonin (Mel), provides compelling evidence for the pro-sedative potential of 1,8-Cineole. The 19-fold increase in Trp after 30 min is striking, suggesting a link between 1,8-Cineole administration and enhanced Trp availability in the brain, possibly by influencing its transport across the blood–brain barrier or modulating peripheral metabolic pathways that compete for Trp [ 96 97 98 Regarding the GABAergic system, the substantial 78.82-fold increase in Glu, the direct precursor for GABA synthesis, coupled with the 3.34-fold increase in Gln, points towards a significantly augmented substrate pool for GABA production ( Table S4 99 The spatial analysis ( Figure 6 100 101 Furthermore, the reported interplay, where GABA can promote melatonin synthesis by facilitating the conversion of 5-HT to N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine [ 95 Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the present study. The primary aim of this work was to establish the spatiotemporal brain distribution of 1,8-cineole and its metabolite and to investigate their in situ neuromodulatory effects using AFADESI-MSI—a technique that uniquely enables spatially resolved molecular mapping. Consequently, a key limitation is the absence of concurrent behavioral, electrophysiological, or sleep-state validation. Additionally, the sample size of n 4. Conclusions AFADESI-MSI revealed 1,8-Cineole’s rapid brain penetration and distinct spatiotemporal pharmacokinetics from its metabolite, 2-hydroxy-1,8-Cineole. Both peaked at 30 min post-administration, but the metabolite achieved higher brain exposure. 1,8-Cineole was predominant in the cortex (CTX)/hippocampus (HP), while 2-hydroxy-1,8-Cineole, also high in the CTX/HP, showed most significant accumulation and prolonged retention in the pineal gland (PG). Coinciding with these drug distributions, we observed region-dependent alterations in neurotransmitter levels (most pronounced in PG > HP, CB > CA > CTX). Crucially, these alterations included in situ, region-specific increases in the levels of key metabolites within the serotonergic (Trp, 5-HT, Mel ↑) and GABAergic (Gln, GABA ↑) pathways. This study provides direct molecular evidence linking 1,8-Cineole to region-specific changes in neurotransmitter systems. These findings support the hypothesis that 1,8-Cineole contributes to Sugmel-3′s central sedative–hypnotic properties in association with the observed neurometabolic alterations, guiding future identification of specific molecular targets.
