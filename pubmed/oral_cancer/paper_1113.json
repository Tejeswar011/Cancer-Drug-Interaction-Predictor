In this study, we established a rat HS model and observed significant inflammatory responses and neuronal pyroptosis in the prefrontal cortex 6 h post-heat exposure, with the injury severity increasing over time. Mechanistically, HS activated the caspase-1/GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis pathway through NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in IL-1β and IL-18 release. Additionally, HS caused a marked increase in homocysteine (Hcy) levels in both the serum and the prefrontal cortex, accompanied by reduced expression of the Hcy metabolic enzymes MTHFR and CSE, suggesting Hcy metabolism disruption. In vitro, Hcy induced pyroptosis in PC12 cells, elevating IL-1β, IL-18, and LDH levels. Notably, the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 mitigated this effect by reducing IL-18 and LDH release. Reducing Hcy in vivo alleviated neuronal pyroptosis and counteracted the YTHDF2-mediated decrease in NLRP3 mRNA m 6 6 6 6 heat stroke pyroptosis prefrontal cortex homocysteine NLRP3 PC12 cell line Not applicable. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Heat stroke (HS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by a core body temperature exceeding 40 °C, accompanied by central nervous system dysfunction, such as delirium, seizures, or coma [ 1 2 HS involves multiple cell death modalities, with substantial evidence indicating its induction of apoptosis and autophagy [ 3 4 5 6 6 7 Homocysteine (Hcy), a sulfur-based non-protein amino acid, serves as an intermediate metabolite in methionine metabolism [ 8 9 9 10 11 12 13 N6-methyladenosine (m 6 14 15 6 16 6 17 18 19 6 6 20 21 6 These findings suggest that Hcy may play a critical role in HS-induced cerebral injury and cellular pyroptosis. In this context, the present study investigates the involvement and underlying mechanisms of Hcy in the pyroptosis of prefrontal cortical neurons in a HS rat model. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Rat HS Model Specific pathogen-free (SPF) adult male Wistar rats (8 weeks old, 200–250 g) were obtained from Beijing SPF Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China)The animals were housed in SPF-grade facilities at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences under controlled conditions: ambient temperature of 24 ± 2 °C, humidity of 50 ± 10%, and a 12-h light/dark cycle. Following a 5-day acclimatization period with ad libitum access to food and water, the rats were randomly allocated into three experimental groups, with 12 rats in each group. The animal experiments and protocols received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the Academy of Military Medicine Sciences. Rats in the immediate HS group (HS0) were placed in a preheated artificial climate chamber (39.5 ± 0.5 °C, 65 ± 5% humidity) until their core body temperature reached 42 °C, at which point, heatstroke was considered successfully induced, and tissue collection and subsequent experiments were immediately carried out. Rats in the 6-h post-HS group (HS6) were subjected to the identical HS induction protocol as the HS0 group, and then moved from the climate chamber to their home cages immediately after the onset of HS, where they were allowed to recover for 6 h under standard conditions (24 ± 2 °C) before tissue collection and subsequent experiments. All heat exposures were initiated at 08:00 daily. During heat exposure, the animals were fasted with water restriction. The core body temperature was monitored every 30 min using a rectal thermometer (Taiwan, China), with the measurement frequency increased to every 10 min once the rectal temperature reached 41.5 °C. The control rats underwent the same procedure without being heated. 2.2. Vitamin B-Complex Treatment To determine the role of Hcy in HS, a vitamin B complex was used to lower Hcy levels, which consisted of folic acid (10 mg/kg/d), vitamin B6 (24 mg/kg/d), vitamin B12 (20 μg/kg/d), and betaine (10 mg/kg/d) (Michigan, USA). The corresponding control group was administered the solvent via gavage. All groups received daily gavage administration at 9:00 AM (2 mL volume) for 2 weeks. Before inducing heat stress (HS) in the rats, the HS6 + VitB group received a pre-treatment with a composite B vitamin oral gavage, while the control group and HS6 + H 2 2 2.3. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) The rat was euthanized via intraperitoneal anesthesia administration (2,2,2-tribromoethanol and tert-amyl alcohol (0.2 mL/10 g body weight)), and prefrontal cortex tissue samples (1 mm 3 2.4. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (#94289, Michigan, USA). The RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (Massachusetts, USA). For cDNA synthesis, 1000 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a commercial reverse transcription kit (#G490, Houston, Canada). qRT-PCR was performed using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (#DRR820A, Kusatsu, Japan) and a LightCycler 480 system (Basel, Switzerland). Gene-specific primers ( Table 1 2.5. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) The following commercial ELISA kits were used to measure the concentrations of caspase-1, caspase-4, SAM, and SAH in the rat prefrontal cortex samples, as well as IL-18, IL-1β, LDH, SAM, and SAH concentrations in the rat serum and cell culture supernatants, including the Caspase-1 Activity Assay Kit (#KTA3020, Wuhan, China), Caspase-4 Activity Assay Kit (#KTA3032, Wuhan, China), Rat IL-18 ELISA Kit (#KTE3044, Wuhan, China), Rat IL-1β ELISA Kit (#KTE9001, Wuhan, China), Rat L-Lactate Dehydrogenase ELISA Kit (#AKC0003M, Shanghai, China), SAM ELISA Kit (A112998, Shanghai, China), and SAM ELISA Kit (A113059, Fusheng, China). A syringe needle (Foshan, China) was inserted from the apex towards the ventricle to collect blood into a serum separator tube (Shijiazhuang, China). The tube was inverted and mixed several times, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and served as a serum sample. 2.6. Western Blotting The prefrontal cortex tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer (#R0020, Beijing, China) and centrifuged. The protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (#W9924, Beijing, China). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Hercules, CA, USA). After blocking with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (all diluted in TBST) including NLRP3 (Danvers, MA, USA; 1:1000); caspase-4, IL-18, ASC, GSDMD, IL-1β, caspase-1, CSE, MS, MTHFR, CBS (Wuhan, China; 1:1000); and β-actin (Wuhan, China; 1:5000) antibodies. Following TBST washes, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (#RS0002, California, USA; 1:2000) or goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (#RS0001, California, USA; 1:2000) for 2 h at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (Wuhan, China). 2.7. Immunofluorescence The brains were fixed (2–3 h), dehydrated in 10%/20%/30% sucrose, embedded in OCT (Kunshan, China), and frozen. Prefrontal cortex sections were cryosectioned (Weztlar, Germany), mounted on chilled slides (Hefei, China), dried (37 °C), washed in PBS (15 min), permeabilized (0.3% Triton X-100, 30 min), and rinsed (3× PBS). Antigen retrieval was performed using a 1× sodium citrate buffer (10 min, heated), followed by PBS washes (3×). The sections were blocked (4 °C, 1–2 h), and then incubated with primary antibodies (200 µL/slide, 4 °C, 24 h): mouse anti-NeuN (#ab104224, Cambridge, MA, USA; 1:100), rabbit anti-NLRP3 (#27458-1-AP, Wuhan, China; 1:100), and rabbit anti-GSDMD (#20770-1-AP, Wuhan, China; 1:100). After PBS washes (3×), secondary antibodies (200 µL/slide) were applied: goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (#ab150080, Cambridge, MA, USA; 1:200), goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (#ab150077, Cambridge, MA, USA; 1:200, 2 h, room temperature in the dark). Following PBS washes and drying, the sections were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium (#F6057, Michigan, USA) and coverslipped for confocal microscopy (Hong Kong, China) observation. Using ImageJ 1.8.0 software, quantitative analysis of the fluorescence signals was performed using the thresholding method with area analysis. 2.8. Cell Culture and Intervention The PC12 cell line (highly differentiated rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells) (#CL-0481, Wuhan, China) was used as a neuronal model and cultured in RPMI-1640 basal medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Increased Neuronal Pyroptosis in Prefrontal Cortex of HS Rats The survival rate of the HS0 rats was 90%, and it decreased to 75% in the HS6 rats ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 AIM2, IL-6, NLRP1, NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-18 Figure 1 3.2. Pyroptosis in Prefrontal Cortical Neurons of HS Rats Primarily Occurs Through the Classical Pathway Western blot analysis showed significant upregulation of classical pyroptosis pathway components in the HS6 group compared to the controls, including NLRP3, GSDMD, and cleaved caspase-1 ( Figure 2 Figure 2 3.3. Hcy Metabolism Disorder in the Prefrontal Cortex of HS Rats Given that Hcy can induce oxidative stress, cellular dysfunction, cell death, and inflammation, we investigated its potential role in HS pathogenesis and neuronal pyroptosis. The results showed that Hcy levels were significantly increased in the serum of both the HS0 and HS6 rats, and in the prefrontal cortex of the HS6 group compared to the controls ( Figure 3 Figure 3 3.4. Hcy Mediates Pyroptosis of Neurons in the Prefrontal Cortex of HS Rats To investigate whether Hcy contributes to pyroptosis in HS rat neurons in the prefrontal cortex, we administered a vitamin B complex (VitB) to downregulate Hcy levels in the HS rats. ELISA was performed to measure pyroptosis-related proteases and inflammatory factors, while qRT-PCR was used to assess pyroptosis-related gene expression.

Discussion As global warming progresses, HS is gradually becoming an important health issue [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Pyroptosis proceeds through three distinct pathways: the classical and non-canonical pathways, and a newly identified caspase-3/8-mediated pathway [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Hyperhomocysteinemia is known to exacerbate oxidative stress, promote inflammation, and contribute neurological dysfunction [ 46 12 47 Accumulating evidence has identified NLRP3-mediated neuronal pyroptosis as a critical mechanism in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease [ 48 49 50 40 51 52 53 54 40 39 N6-methyladenosine (m 6 13 6 16 6 6 55 6 6 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 6 6 6 6 6 6 63 6 5. Conclusions In summary, HS induces prefrontal cortical damage in rats, which is characterized by increased neuronal pyroptosis that is predominantly mediated through the NLRP3-dependent classical pathway. Concurrently, HS triggers a significant elevation in Hcy levels in the prefrontal cortex, likely due to inducing metabolic disturbances. Our findings suggest that Hcy may contribute to HS-induced brain injury in rats by mediating neuronal pyroptosis via the m 6 Our findings emphasize the critical importance of early therapeutic intervention during the initial window period following HS onset. The NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream signaling pathways emerged as promising therapeutic targets for HS treatment. Future studies should further assess the clinical potential of targeting these mechanisms to develop more effective treatment strategies.
