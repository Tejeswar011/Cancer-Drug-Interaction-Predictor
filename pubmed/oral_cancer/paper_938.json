Less frequent but noteworthy is the development of salivary fistulas, which, although rare, constitute a clinically relevant condition. This research aimed to investigate factors impacting salivary fistula formation and treatment in patients surgically treated for mandibular condylar process fracture. This study included 395 patients who underwent open rigid internal fixation (ORIF). Salivary fistula occurred in 5.8% of those treated.

Introduction Maxillofacial surgery is a traumatology-associated medical discipline. Consequently, many maxillofacial surgeons are routinely tasked with managing fractures and injuries resulting from various etiologies, including road traffic accidents, assaults, falls, sports-related contusions, and work-related incidents. The mandible has been identified as the most frequently fractured bone in the facial region [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 18 24 Figure 1 19 A postoperative salivary fistula is a rare but especially unpleasant complication. The condition results in a significant reduction in patient quality of life, causing suffering. As reported in the literature, fistula incidence ranges from 4.3% [ 21 25 21 25 26 Figure 1 26 27 28 Following a detailed analysis of the extant literature, the authors concluded that the current knowledge does not describe the problem exhaustively and that further research is needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding. The present study was designed to investigate the incidence of postoperative salivary fistulas in patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for mandibular condylar fractures. In addition, it aimed to analyze the therapeutic outcomes of different management strategies in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of available treatment modalities. 2. Materials and Methods Retrospective material was obtained from the medical records of all patients admitted to the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery at the Medical University of Lodz (Poland) who underwent surgical treatment for a mandibular condylar process fracture between 2017 and 2024. Institutional approval was granted before data collection and the research also obtained approval from the Bioethics Committee (RNN/104/25/KE). This study was reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines [ 29 The inclusion criteria that were employed in this study were as follows: - A diagnosis of mandibular condylar process fracture; - ORIF treatment; - Complete medical history and personal data; - Patients attending follow-up appointments. The exclusion criteria were as follows: - Close treatment; - Incomplete medical history; - Lack of follow-up appointments; - Patients with a history of cancer of the head and neck region. The data were collected by one surgeon. The final data set comprised 395 patients aged 11–88 years, with a median age of 37 years old. Patients were observed during a six-month follow-up. Fractures were classified based on the three most widely recognized classifications (Kozakiewicz’s, Neff’s, and Loukota’s). Six diagnoses of mandible condylar fracture could be established: base, low-neck, and high-neck fractures and head fracture types A, B, and C [ 30 31 32 A comprehensive data set was obtained from patients, including demographic variables such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The surgical intervention data included details regarding delays (in days), surgery duration (in minutes), and use of fixation materials. Preoperative characteristics, including hemoglobin and white blood cell levels, were also documented. The analysis considered the patients’ place of residence, the type of condylar process fracture, the season of the year during surgery, whether the patient had been referred from another medical center, the surgical approach, co-morbidities, postoperative C-reactive protein level (CRP), the presence of preauricular skin desensitization and facial nerve function in seven examinations during follow-up (immediately postoperatively and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months). In our center, BMI is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared (BMI = weight (in kg)/height 2 2 33 In all 395 cases of mandibular condylar fractures managed with ORIF, identical postoperative instructions were provided. Patients were advised to follow a liquid diet for the first 7 days, followed by a semi-liquid diet for 5 weeks, while avoiding spicy foods. The dressings on the skin wound should be changed regularly and kept clean for 7 days whenever a long-term wound wear cannot be applied. A subsequent appointment should be established for suture removal between days 7 and 10 post-procedure. In the event of intraoral wounds, it is recommended that a chlorhexidine rinse is used at least three times a day, in addition to standard oral hygiene practices ( Figure 2 Salivary fistulas were detected by surgeons during patient examination in the follow-up period or noted by patients during self-assessment. In accordance with the severity of salivary leakage ( Figure 3 Table 1 Disinfection, a tasteless diet, and pressure dressing; Chemical cauterization with a 10% solution of AgNO 3 Surgical treatment—plastic surgery of the fistula. The treatment plan was determined by the surgeon following fistula assessment. The choice of method depended on the severity of salivary leakage, which was classified using a three-level qualitative scale of saliva outflow intensity ( Table 1 1. Slight: For the first degree on the salivary leakage scale, manifestations are mostly only reported by patients. The amount of saliva flow is barely visible, appearing as single drops on the aperture area, especially during eating. The skin around the aperture looks healthy, with no signs of irritation or inflammation. The patient’s quality of life is not significantly impaired, although some patients report esthetic dissatisfaction. 2. Moderate: For the second degree on the salivary leakage scale, manifestations are clinically visible during examination; the surgeon detects moisture on the aperture area, and the patient reports a continuous salivary flow, especially during eating and sometimes when talking. A dressing needs to be worn on the salivary aperture skin. The skin around the aperture may be irritated, but often remains unchanged or is only slightly altered. This complication influences the patient’s quality of life because of the constant need to wear dressings, and because of the discomfort and embarrassment experienced during ordinary daily activities. 3. Profuse: For the third degree on the salivary leakage scale, manifestations are clearly visible during clinical examination and the surgeon detects a significant amount of saliva. The patient reports a constant flow of saliva during the day and night. The dressing on the aperture area needs to be changed many times per day. In many cases, the skin around the aperture is damaged and painful due to constant irritation. Signs of inflammation may also be visible. Quality of life is significantly impaired due to the tremendous salivary flow, which makes it difficult to lead a normal life and deal with everyday activities. In cases of minor saliva leakage, the most conservative approach was adopted. This entailed the patient undergoing fistula disinfection, following a tasteless diet, and applying a pressure dressing. In the event of moderate saliva flow and a medium-sized fistula aperture, a combination of measures was employed, including a tasteless diet, pressure dressing, chemical cauterization, and the administration of cholinolytic drugs. Cases where there was a high amount of saliva flow and a large fistula outlet qualified for a two-layer salivary fistula surgical procedure. Due to there being several different surgeons, the salivary fistula was disinfected using four types of rinsing solution; the choice of rinsing solution depended on the attending doctor’s preferences. These were a chlorhexidine solution, an octenidine solution, disinfectants comprising nanosilver and solutions including sodium hypochlorite (NaClO 3 Surgical plasty of the fistula involves the removal of the pathological channel in soft tissues and the restoration of tissue continuity. Prior to undergoing surgery, comprehensive diagnostic tests are conducted to ascertain the characteristics of the fistula and its underlying etiology. Furthermore, it is essential to provide the patient with comprehensive information regarding the surgery itself, the potential risks of complications, and the expected recovery period. In the event of a surgical wound in the parotid gland area being revised, precise tissue preparation is conducted to avoid facial nerve damage. The dissected tissues should then be sutured securely and in layers. The initial layer of the suture is the accurately sutured periauricular fascia; the second layer is the subskin suture. It is crucial to ensure that the suture lines of these two tissue layers do not run on top of each other. The suture lines should be laterally offset in order to reduce the likelihood of subsequent postoperative wound healing failure and salivary fistula return. Statistical analyses were conducted using Statgraphics Centurion 18 (Statgraphics Technologies Inc., The Plains, VA, USA). The procedure included tests of normality and a paired-samples sign test to assess time-dependent variations. The effect of the qualitative variable on salivary fistula formation was examined using the Kruskal–Wallis test, and regression analysis was applied to explore associations between quantitative variables. Moreover, logistic regression was performed to ascertain independent risk factors for salivary fistula complication after osteosynthesis. For this. Then, due to the identification of a small number of independent risk factors, the authors sought composite factors via factor analysis. Reducing the number of variables describing the study population makes it easier to interpret the data in a multidimensional environment. A p 3. Results The statistical analysis revealed that 5.8% of patients treated with ORIF developed postoperative complications in the form of a salivary fistula ( Table 2 www.chm.eu 3 This investigation has shown that some factors influence how late after surgery a salivary fistula might appear. The longer the surgical procedure takes, the earlier the fistula will appear (correlation coefficient, CC = 0.478, p Figure 4 The research indicated three factors (white blood cell levels, CRP and BMI) that influence fistula treatment duration. Moderately elevated white blood cell levels ( p Table 3 p Table 3 p Table 3 The most efficacious method of closing salivary fistulas is disinfection, the application of pressure dressing and a tasteless diet. In half of the patients observed, this was sufficient to permanently close the fistula ( p Figure 5 Table 4 p Moreover, a comprehensive statistical analysis was conducted on a range of factors potentially impacting postoperative salivary fistula formation. These factors encompassed demographic details such as age and BMI; details of the surgical intervention including any delay, surgery duration, surgical approach, and intraoperative salivary gland management (transparotid or bypassing approach) ( Table 5 p We next focused on identifying independent risk factors for salivary fistula formation after surgical treatment for mandibular condylar process fracture. A comprehensive investigation involving 27 potential factors was conducted utilizing logistic regression. Male gender ( p Table 6 The variables investigated as potential risk factors were as follows: age, BMI, any surgery delay, surgery duration, patient co-morbidities, preoperative hemoglobin level, preoperative white blood cell count, number of screws used for surgical stabilization, immediate postoperative facial nerve function, facial nerve function during follow-up at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after surgery, sex, patient location, reason for injury, use of intoxicants, diagnosis of injury, type of condylar fracture, season of the year during injury, referral from other centers, surgical approach, screw material, type of fixation material, and occurrence of preauricular skin desensitization. Logistic regression only indicated sex as an independent risk factor. The variables selected for factor analysis were age, BMI, co-morbidity, any surgery delay, surgery duration and magnitude of facial nerve dysfunction, immediately after osteosynthesis and 1 and 2 months post-op (House–Brackmann Scale 00M, House–Brackmann Scale 01M, House–Brackmann Scale 02M). This selection was dictated by sampling adequacy, as expressed by the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure. A test score of 0.7 was obtained for this input data set. For factorization to be worthwhile, KMO should be at least 0.6. Thus, factorization was likely to provide interesting information about any underlying factors. Next, three factors were extracted that had an Eigenvalue greater than 1. Together, the factors expressed 71.4% of the variability contained in the eight input variables. We determined three equations for factor calculation after matrix rotation ( Figure 6 Figure 7 Post-op Factor = 0.178046 × Age − 0.142933 × BMI + 0.123149 × Delay of Surgery + 0.415526 × Duration of Surgery + 0.0495633 × Co-Morbidity + 0.965919 × House–Brackmann Scale 00M + 0.978027 × House–Brackmann Scale 01M + 0.957083 × House–Brackmann Scale 02M (1) This factor highlights the importance of characteristics that describe the patient’s postoperative state. The second rotated factor has the following equation: Patient Dependent Factor = 0.825884 × Age + 0.454182 × BMI + 0.0747151 × Delay of Surgery + 0.190828 × Duration of Surgery + 0.766203 × Co-Morbidity − 0.00920252 × House–Brackmann Scale 00M + 0.0260572 × House–Brackmann Scale 01M + 0.0801639 × House–Brackmann Scale 02M (2) This factor mainly describes a patient’s pre-surgical condition. The third rotated factor has the following equation: Medical Dependent Factor = − 0.120654 × Age + 0.27525 × BMI + 0.871126 × Delay of Surgery − 0.532189 × Duration of Surgery − 0.052594 × Co-Morbidity − 0.00227824 × House–Brackmann Scale 00M − 0.0479474 × House–Brackmann Scale 01M − 0.0618094 × House–Brackmann Scale 02M (3) This factor most strongly depends on—and thus indicates the importance of—variables dependent on the activities of the maxillofacial surgery department. During follow-up, a Kruskal–Wallis test for post-op and medical dependent factors (incidents of fistula creation) revealed that, in the group of patients with fistulas, the former reached a median of 68 versus in 77 in the healthy group (a statistically significant difference, p p 4. Discussion Salivary fistula formation generally results from disruption of the salivary duct or injury to glandular tissue, with subsequent leakage occurring through the surgical suture line. Depending on its location, a salivary fistula can be classified as either cutaneous or intraoral. Only cutaneous fistulas require treatment due to the long-term inconvenience for the patient and due to esthetic reasons. Constant skin irritation from the flowing saliva can cause pathological skin lesions. Salivary fistulas mainly affect the parotid glands [ 18 34 35 Analyzing the results, male sex was revealed to be an independent risk factor for the formation of salivary fistulas as a complication of surgical treatment for condylar process fractures. A retrospective cohort study conducted by Al-Taki et al. examined the effect of gender on postoperative morbidity and mortality. The results indicated that the female gender was less associated with complications and mortality after surgery than the male gender [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 It is worth nothing that extended surgical procedure duration can be associated with increased surgical intervention complexity [ 48 15 48 49 50 51 52 In terms of surgical approach, our results oppose some studies. This investigation revealed that the surgical approach and the salivary gland management technique used during surgery (transparotid or bypassing the gland) were statistically irrelevant. The findings of El Sheikh et al. are consistent with our observations, as their study also did not reveal statistically significant differences between patients treated using different surgical approaches—in their study, intraoral versus retromandibular approach [ 53 54 21 11 55 18 Slightly elevated WBC levels are a symptom of increased immune system activity [ 56 57 58 59 57 58 60 61 62 63 38 64 65 66 In the issue of salivary fistulae treatment duration, the study conducted by Ebenezer V. et al. [ 67 68 34 69 39 Weissler et al. demonstrated treatment methods for parotid duct injury similar those presented in our management proposition. Methods were applied in accordance with the condition severity and previous treatment effectiveness: saliva aspirations and antibiotic therapy, antisialagogue medication therapy, botulin toxin injections (in the event conservative treatment failure), and surgical intervention (for the most severe cases) [ 35 70 71 68 72 73 Rinsing the fistula with an appropriate disinfectant is fundamental to its management [ 69 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 3 85 86 Cholinolytics can be used during salivary fistula treatment to suppress glandular function during healing [ 77 87 88 In the case of chemical treatment for salivary fistulas, argentum nitricum solution can be employed for chemical cauterization. Cauterization involves a chemical acting on the granulating wound or destroying the pathological tissue [ 89 90 91 92 Surgical intervention is effective in managing salivary fistulas with high saliva secretion or insufficient response to conservative therapy [ 18 35 69 93 It is acknowledged that this study is not without its limitations. The data were collected by one surgeon from a single medical center, what can be connected with limited diversity of patient demographics and local treatment protocols. Therefore, the possibility of generalizing the results to other institutions may be limited. The retrospective character of this paper resulted in a small sample size, risk of missing data or errors in medical records, and differences in the medical histories reported by different surgeons over the seven-year period. The surgical procedures were conducted by surgeons with different levels of experience. Various suture materials and surgical techniques were used, as well as different rinsing solutions. Due to the limited studies describing this issue and the impossibility of conducting a substantive discussion of the field, our investigation is pioneering, and the results should be treated more as hypotheses rather than theses. We suggest that further research should concentrate on repeating these investigative methods on larger cohorts from different societies and varying patient demographics. This would help to strengthen the validity and reliability of clinical results in this surgical field. Research and development into more innovative methods of treating salivary fistulas, especially in more complicated cases, is also necessary. 5. Conclusions Salivary fistula after ORIF for condylar process fractures is a rare complication, occurring more frequently in males. This condition can typically be managed within a short treatment period (median: 10 days), most often with conservative, minimally invasive methods such as disinfection, pressure dressing, and a tasteless diet. Moderately elevated WBC and CRP levels appear to facilitate healing, whereas lower BMI may delay recovery. Further studies are required to confirm these findings due to the limitations of the present study.
