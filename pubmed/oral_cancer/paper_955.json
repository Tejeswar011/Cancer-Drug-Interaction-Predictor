Hyperinsulinemia can precede and cause insulin resistance. In situations of fuel overload, insulin resistance limits the amount fuel (glucose and fatty acids) entering insulin-sensitive tissues. When energy intake is chronically greater than energy expenditure, the capacity of the subcutaneous fat tissues to store fat can be overpowered. If subcutaneous fat tissues are no longer able to accommodate excess energy, there will be spillover of lipids. Excess calories will be stored as ectopic fat (triglycerides) in the liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. Growing evidence suggests that ectopic fat deposition directly causes insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Overnutrition and ectopic fat increase diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation in fat cells, hepatocytes, and skeletal muscle cells. A unifying hypothesis proposes that translocated DAG into the plasma membrane induces insulin resistance in all these three cell types. In addition, ectopic fat accumulation in the pancreas induces beta-cell dysfunction. Introducing a negative energy balance by bariatric surgery or a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) reduces ectopic fat depositions from the liver and pancreas and decreases intracellular DAG content: both are effective treatments to restore insulin sensitivity, normalize metabolism, and put type 2 diabetes in remission.

Introduction Pancreatic insulin secretion rises with increasing plasma glucose concentrations. In individuals with normal glucose tolerance and insulin receptor sensitivity, glucose homeostasis is achieved with relatively low insulin levels. Plasma glucose levels and insulin concentrations in individuals with normal glucose tolerance and impaired glucose tolerance show a positive correlation during an oral glucose tolerance test [ 1 1 2 2. Fasting Hyperinsulinemia May Precede Insulin Resistance Type 2 diabetes is a complex and multifactorial disease characterized by impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Both hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Changes in pancreatic insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity may arise many years before the development of type 2 diabetes [ 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 Figure 1 The view that insulin resistance is the principal cause of type 2 diabetes has been challenged in the last years. Insulin secretion appears to be more heritable than insulin resistance: in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), only a few loci point to insulin resistance as the primary cause of type 2 diabetes, whereas the majority of the loci identified by GWAS point towards defects in pancreatic beta-cells, specifically impacting insulin secretion [ 10 11 12 13 1 Figure 1 1 14 15 Figure 1 The development of insulin resistance has been proposed to be a defense mechanism of the body protecting insulin-sensitive tissues against fuel overload and fuel toxicity [ 16 17 It is widely accepted that hypersecretion of a hormone can lead to desensitization of its receptor and signaling pathway at the cellular level, primarily through downregulation of the receptor [ 18 19 9 20 18 Support for a causal role of hyperinsulinemia in the development of insulin resistance is provided by a prospective study in Pima Indians demonstrating that pancreatic hypersecretion of insulin is the first defect that occurs prior to insulin resistance [ 21 22 23 23 9 14 24 24 24 24 When non-diabetic subjects with insulin resistance but without hyperinsulinemia were compared with non-diabetic subjects with hyperinsulinemia without insulin resistance, significant differences were found in the respective clinical phenotypes, suggesting that subjects with primary hyperinsulinemia and subjects with primary insulin resistance carry distinct pathogenic potential in terms of the components of the insulin resistance syndrome [ 25 Discussions about the “egg and chicken” relationship between hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance have important clinical implications [ 26 26 26 3. Fasting Hyperinsulinemia Is a Premature Sign of Type 2 Diabetes Pories et al. found (in a cross-sectional study) that during progression from normal glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes, maximum fasting plasma insulin concentrations in people with type 2 diabetes were still twice as high as in euglycemic lean individuals, despite the fact that peak insulin secretion in the former individuals was decreased after an oral glucose load [ 27 1 27 Figure 2 Figure 2 21 28 29 30 31 32 33 21 30 34 35 36 37 All these data support the hypothesis that fasting/basal hyperinsulinemia precedes development of both insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. 4. What Is the Cause of Hyperinsulinemia? Hyperinsulinemia can be caused by increased pancreatic insulin secretion in the fasting state or postprandially after ingestion of carbohydrates and/or free fatty acids [ 38 39 39 38 In 2011, Barbara Corkey proposed in her Banting lecture that long-term overnutrition (excess nutrient ingestion), food additives, artificial sweeteners, and environmental factors induce hyperinsulinemia superimposed on a susceptible genetic background of basal insulin levels, and she suggested that this combination of factors may be major cause of the current increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity [ 15 Figure 3 9 Figure 3 40 40 40 41 42 43 44 45 45 46 47 47 48 47 49 47 5. Hyperinsulinemia and Obesity A major effect of insulin (hyperinsulinemia) is promoting lipogenesis by stimulating fatty acid uptake and triglyceride synthesis in fat cells [ 50 51 52 50 53 54 55 56 57 58 58 34 59 Genetic studies are often used to provide better insights into cause-and-effects and the role of specific components in the pathogenesis of a condition/disease. A bi-directional Mendelian Randomization study recently examined the relationship between insulin secretion and BMI in humans and found that genetically determined insulin secretion strongly predicted BMI, whereas, in contrast, genetically determined BMI did not predict insulin secretion [ 60 61 62 6. The Modulation of Food Intake by Central Insulin Action and Central Insulin Resistance Insulin from the blood can penetrate into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at a slow rate and the insulin levels within the CSF are an integral over time of the levels in the blood [ 63 64 65 65 65 66 64 7. The Relationship Between Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mechanisms responsible for the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes are very complex [ 67 68 69 70 70 71 71 2 72 73 2 69 74 2 2 74 Figure 4 Although BMI is a widely used tool, its use has significant limitations: for example, it is not a reliable indicator of ectopic fat accumulation. Individuals with normal or overweight BMIs can be in possession of significant amounts of ectopic fat depositions [ 75 76 8. The Relationship Between Ectopic Fat Storage, Insulin Resistance, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The portal/visceral hypothesis proposed that particularly an increased visceral/abdominal fat mass leads to increased free fatty acid flux and inhibition of insulin action in the typical insulin sensitive tissues [ 77 77 78 79 80 80 81 80 81 82 83 77 Subcutaneous fat tissue is the largest storage site of excess fat in the body [ 78 84 84 Figure 5 When subcutaneous fat tissue is no longer able to accommodate excess energy (due to an insufficient and limited ability of the subcutaneous fat tissue to proliferate and recruit new fat cells), there will be altered fat partitioning producing a pattern of fat deposition, which shows parallels with (partial) lipodystrophy in humans: excess calories will be stored as ectopic fat (triglycerides) in the abdomen, liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscle [ 77 78 85 78 86 69 86 69 86 Deposition of ectopic fat into the liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscles has been hypothesized to explain the established link between insulin resistance, beta cell dysfunction, and type 2 diabetes [ 77 Figure 5 73 74 70 Figure 5 70 75 Several studies demonstrated that the degree of ectopic fat deposition in the liver and skeletal muscle strongly correlates with insulin resistance [ 77 77 77 87 77 88 89 90 91 9. Fat Cell Hypertrophy Correlates with Insulin Resistance Understanding the pathophysiological molecular mechanisms involved in insulin resistance and exhaustion of the pancreatic beta cells is essential for developing therapeutic strategies that can cure type 2 diabetes. An overactive entero-insular axis has been suggested to play a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and obesity [ 92 93 94 95 95 96 97 98 99 99 99 100 77 77 100 101 10. Insulin-Mediated Effects on Lipolysis, Glucose Metabolism, and Ectopic Fat Deposition Insulin plays a key role in the interaction between lipolysis of fat cells, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and regulation of hepatic glucose production [ 102 103 104 84 105 105 105 105 11. The Role of Hyperinsulinemia on Tissue-Level Inflammation Increasing data suggest that diet-driven chronic hyperinsulinemia itself may also cause adipose tissue inflammation [ 106 107 108 107 107 107 109 110 107 12. Lipotoxicity May Play a Key Role in the Development of Insulin Resistance in Type 2 Diabetes Lipotoxicity refers to the harmful effects of excessive lipid accumulation in non-fat tissues. In the literature, it is well established that derangements in lipid metabolism may play an important role in the development of insulin resistance in individuals with type 2 diabetes [ 111 111 112 113 112 114 Dysfunctional fat cells may also lead to altered secretion of adipokines and cytokines [ 115 116 117 116 13. Plasma Membrane Sn-1,2-diacylglycerol Plays a Critical Role in Insulin Resistance of Fat Cells Insulin action in subcutaneous fat cells is dysregulated by overnutrition with a high fat diet [ 84 84 Figure 6 84 84 84 14. Cause of Increased Diacylglycerol Content in Liver and Skeletal Muscles Various mechanisms can cause a high net intracellular diacylglycerol (DAG) content in the skeletal muscles and liver [ 118 118 118 118 15. Plasma Membrane Sn-1,2-diacylglycerols Play a Critical Role in Insulin Resistance of Skeletal Muscles and Liver 15.1. Insulin Resistance of Skeletal Muscles Previously, Petersen et al. reported that mitochondrial ATP production in skeletal muscles of young, lean, normoglycemic, insulin-resistant offspring of parents with type 2 diabetes was approximately 30% decreased [ 119 120 120 Muscle insulin resistance is a key future of type 2 diabetes and strongly associated with increased intramyocellular lipid content [ 121 121 121 121 121 122 122 Figure 7 121 123 Figure 7 15.2. Insulin Resistance of Hepatocytes Several studies reported that a fatty liver is not invariably associated with hepatic insulin resistance. This suggests that the accumulation of triglycerides per se is likely not the main factor in causing hepatic insulin resistance [ 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 Figure 8 We hypothesize that DAG-mediated insulin receptor resistance is an adaptation of the cells protecting fat cells, skeletal muscle cells, and hepatocytes against (further) nutrient overload and fuel toxicity. Although Shulman et al. observed a strong association between intracellular lipid droplets containing DAGs and insulin resistance in hepatocytes, they showed that sequestration of sn-1,2-DAGs in intracellular droplets in hepatocytes does not cause insulin resistance [ 130 131 130 132 16. Ectopic Fat and the Pancreas When, due to chronic overnutrition, fat can no longer be stored in the “safe” subcutaneous fat depots, excess fat is also directed towards the pancreas, where it is deposited as ectopic fat. Pancreatic ectopic fat has been reported in beta cells and exocrine parenchyma [ 133 134 135 136 136 137 137 138 139 140 140 17. Correction of Hyperinsulinemia and Prompt Remission of Type 2 Diabetes After Bariatric Surgery Type 2 diabetes was very long considered to be a progressive and inexorable disease. However, Pories already provided 30 years ago evidence that gastric bypass surgery can lead to long-term remission of type 2 diabetes [ 141 141 142 Figure 9 141 1 Figure 9 141 142 141 141 1 1 141 In a more recent study, obese individuals with normal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes were matched for age, weight, and sex, and studied before and 8 weeks after gastric bypass surgery [ 143 143 143 143 143 143 144 144 145 146 18. How Does Bariatric Surgery Result in Quick Remission of Type 2 Diabetes? It has been hypothesized that the introduction of a sudden negative energy balance after bariatric surgery is responsible for the restoration of normal metabolism in type 2 diabetes patients. Due to the sudden energy restriction, liver fat levels fall and normal hepatic insulin sensitivity is restored within days [ 147 147 147 148 147 19. Reversal of Type 2 Diabetes After a Very-Low-Calorie-Diet (VLCD) In patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, moderate weight loss (≈−8 kg) by a hypocaloric very-low-fat-diet (3% fat and ~1200 kcal/day) normalized fasting hyperglycemia and reversed hepatic steatosis [ 149 149 149 149 150 150 149 151 151 151 148 152 148 152 153 154 154 154 154 20. How Does a Very-Low-Calorie-Diet Result in Quick Remission of Type 2 Diabetes? In an animal model of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, a 3-day, very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) (one-quarter their typical intake) reversed diabetes before weight loss and this target was reached by multiple mechanisms: [1] A VLCD reduced fasting hyperglycemia by reducing hepatic triglyceride (TAG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) content: this resulted in reduced TAG-DAG-PKCε activation and improved hepatic insulin sensitivity; [2] A VLCD reduced rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis; [3] A VLCD reduced hepatic acetyl-CoA content which led to decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis from pyruvate carboxylase [ 155 155 155 155 21. Concluding Remarks Genetic background, consuming a “modern” Western diet, and long-term overnutrition may all induce hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia is an important contributor to systemic insulin resistance and, in certain cases, may (even) precede insulin resistance. When there is chronic fuel overload due to overnutrition, insulin resistance is a physiological defense mechanism of the body protecting insulin-sensitive tissues from fuel overload and fuel toxicity. Subcutaneous fat tissues are the largest storage sites of excess fat in the body. When energy intake is chronically larger than energy expenditure, excess calories will initially be stored in the subcutaneous fat tissues. However, if subcutaneous fat tissues are no longer able to accommodate surplus energy intake, excess fat will be directed toward the liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscles, where it is deposited as ectopic fat. Overnutrition is thus a major driver of ectopic fat deposition. There is increasing evidence suggesting that ectopic fat deposition directly causes insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Overnutrition and ectopic fat increase intracellular diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation in fat cells, hepatocytes, and skeletal muscles. Translocated DAG into the plasma cell membrane of these three cell types has been proposed as unifying mechanism to explain the development of insulin resistance in these three tissues. Furthermore, ectopic fat accumulation in the pancreas induces beta-cell dysfunction. Bariatric surgery or a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) can quickly reduce ectopic fat from liver and pancreas and decrease intracellular DAG content: this restores hepatic insulin receptor sensitivity, normalizes metabolism, and put type 2 diabetes in many cases in remission. However, over time, there is a considerable loss of remission of type 2 diabetes. Further research is needed to develop new approaches and strategies to achieve long-term remission of type 2 diabetes in all patients.

Mean fasting levels in lean individuals with normal glucose tolerance (Normal Lean), in individuals with normal glucose tolerance and obesity (Normal Obese), in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and obesity (IGT Obese), individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and fasting blood glucose levels < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) (T2DM Obese < 140), and individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and fasting blood glucose levels > 140 mg/Dl (7.8 mmol/L) (T2DM Obese > 140). Note: fasting plasma insulin concentrations continue to rise from normoglycemia to impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes. In the early phases of development of type 2 diabetes, fasting insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes with fasting blood glucose levels >140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) were 9-fold higher than in lean people with normal fasting glucose levels. Modified from [ 1 Figure 3 Hypothesis for pathogenesis type 2 diabetes and obesity. In 2011 Barbara Corkey proposed in her Banting Lecture in 2011 that overnutrition (excess nutrient ingestion), food additives, artificial sweeteners, and environmental factors induce hyperinsulinemia superimposed on a susceptible genetic background of basal insulin levels [ 15 Figure 4 Age-adjusted relative risk for type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI). In the Nurses’ Health Study, 114,281 female registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years who did not have diagnosed diabetes mellitus in 1976, were prospectively followed for 18 years. Excess risk for diabetes was found in women with normal BMIs (<25 kg/m 2 2 2 2 74 Figure 5 Relation between long-term hyperinsulinemia, chronic intake of excess calories, physical inactivity, subcutaneous fat mass, and the development of ectopic fat depositions in the liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscles. When there is long-term hyperinsulinemia, chronic intake of excess calories, and physical inactivity, the subcutaneous fat tissue can become overpowered (due to an insufficient and limited ability of the subcutaneous fat tissue to proliferate and recruit new fat cells). This may stimulate “spill over” of lipids which results in (ectopic) fat accumulation in the form of triglycerides in non-adipose tissues (such as the liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscles). Deposition of ectopic fat into the liver, pancreas, and skeletal muscles has been hypothesized to explain the established link between insulin resistance, beta cell dysfunction, and type 2 diabetes (see text for details).

Bariatric surgery corrects hyperinsulinemia within one week of surgery. The normalization of plasma insulin levels after one week coincides with the remission of type 2 diabetes. Before bariatric surgery the index of insulin sensitivity (SI) was low, meaning that the body was less responsive to insulin (i.e., was insulin resistant). The SI remained low and was not normalized 3 months after surgery suggesting that hyperinsulinemia was not secondary, compensating for insulin resistance. Modified from [ 141 ",
