Clinical symptoms often include bone pain, deformities, pathological fractures, or nerve compression. Fibrous dysplasia (FD) in the cranio-facial region presents major management concerns because to the risk of deformity, loss of function, and recurrence. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a single institution’s experience managing cranio-facial FD with zolendronic acid, as well as an extensive review of the available literature on the subject. This retrospective study was conducted in the Orthopedic Oncology unit of the Department of Surgical Oncology with a study duration between January 1, 2019, and January 1, 2022. There were seven patients with cranio-facial fibrous dysplasia in the current study. The effects of zolendronic acid were evaluated using clinical assessment, data, radiological findings, biochemical indicators. Furthermore, a comprehensive literature review was conducted in order to compile the current data of cranio-facial FD. The study included seven individuals (five men and two females), four with polyostotic FD and three with cranio-facial FD. The average follow-up duration was 18.75 months. The study found that all parameters improved: the mean VAS score increased from 7 to 1, mean serum calcium levels increased from 8.75 to 8.46 mg/dL, mean serum phosphorus levels increased from 4.46 to 4.17 mg/dL, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels increased from 152 to 93.25 IU/L.A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar with the following keywords: “Fibrous dysplasia,” “Cranio-facial bones,” “Bisphosphonate,” and “Zolendronic acid.” The search included 24 studies published between 2000 and 2022, incorporating all relevant studies available to date. Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of zolendronic acid in the treatment of cranio-facial fibrous dysplasia. Zolendronic acid offers potential as a feasible treatment options in treating cranio-facial FD, with possible advantages including alleviating symptoms, disease progression stabilisation, and morbidity reduction. However, multi-centre prospective randomised study with larger sample numbers and longer follow-up periods are needed in future.
