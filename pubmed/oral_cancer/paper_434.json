Auto-segmentation methods have been widely studied, and commercial solutions are increasingly entering clinical use. However, their adoption warrants a comprehensive, multi-perspective evaluation. The purpose of this study is to compare three commercial artificial intelligence (AI) software solutions (Limbus, MIM and MVision) for HaN OAR auto-segmentation on a cohort of 10 computed tomography images with reference contours obtained from the public HaN-Seg dataset, from both observational (descriptive and empirical) and analytical (geometric, dosimetric and psychometric) perspectives. The observational evaluation included vendor questionnaires on technical specifications and radiographer feedback on usability. The analytical evaluation covered geometric (Dice similarity coefficient, DSC, and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, HD95), dosimetric (dose constraint compliance, OAR priority-based analysis), and psychometric (5-point Likert scale) assessments. All software solutions covered a broad range of OARs. Overall geometric performance differences were relatively small (Limbus: 69.7% DSC, 5.0 mm HD95; MIM: 69.2% DSC, 5.6 mm HD95; MVision: 66.7% DSC, 5.3 mm HD95), however, statistically significant differences were observed for smaller structures such as the cochleae, optic chiasm, and pituitary and thyroid glands. Differences in dosimetric compliance were overall minor, with the lowest compliance observed for the oral cavity and submandibular glands. In terms of qualitative assessment, radiographers gave the highest average Likert rating to Limbus (3.9), followed by MVision (3.7) and MIM (3.5). With few exceptions, most software solutions produced good-quality AI-generated contours (Likert ratings ≥ 3), yet some editing should still be performed to reach clinical acceptability. Notable discrepancies were seen for the optic chiasm and in cases affected by mouth bites or dental artifacts. Importantly, no clear relationship emerged between geometric, dosimetric, and psychometric metrics, underscoring the need for a multi-perspective evaluation without shortcuts.

Accurate delineation of the tumor and OARs from the acquired planning images is critical to ensure local tumor control and prevent damage to normal tissue. The delineation process is typically done manually and relies heavily on the expertise of radiation oncologists, radiographers, and dosimetrists. However, numerous studies have shown that manual delineations are subjective, prone to errors, and very time-consuming 1 2 3 4 6 To address these challenges, several AI algorithms have been developed that make use of deep learning models, which are trained on annotated datasets to learn the patterns and features associated with different anatomical tissues and organs, and then applied to analyze medical images and perform auto-segmentation of the same structures on new images 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 From this perspective, the head and neck (HaN) cancer is particularly challenging to treat with RT since this region is surrounded by a large number of lymph nodes and OARs 15 18 19 40 1 1 1 mean max 24 27 mean max 41 42 1 39 Table 1 An overview of the studies comparing commercial software that perform auto-segmentation of organs-at-risk (OARs) for head and neck radiotherapy planning using artificial intelligence.

Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between AI software based on the Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction (∗ → 0.05 > p p It has to be noted that, due to the variability in the cranial and caudal limits between curated and AI-generated brainstem and spinal cord contours, to ensure a fair comparison the brainstem auto-segmentations were truncated at the caudal end of the curated mask, while the spinal cord auto-segmentations were truncated at both cranial and caudal ends. A similar approach that focuses on the geometric agreement rather than the effects of different contouring guidelines has been also adopted in previous studies 16 38 43 16 Fig. 4 Visual analysis of the relationships between different types of metrics, reported separately for each organ-at-risk ( one per row horizontal axis vertical axis Dosimetric evaluation 3 4 1 4 Table 3 The number of AI-generated contours (out of a total of 10) that meet the dosimetric constraints for a selected organ-at-risk (OAR) ( top L bottom top bottom OAR Dosimetric constraint Limbus MIM MVision No. cases meeting dose constraints Brainstem V EQD 54 Gy 10 10 10 Cochlea (L) D mean 8 8 8 Cochlea (R) 9 9 9 Lacrimal gland (L) D mean 10 10 10 Lacrimal gland (R) 9 9 9 Lips D max 6 5 5 Mandible V 70 Gy 6 6 6 Optic chiasm EQD max 9 10 10 Optic nerve (L) EQD max 9 10 10 Optic nerve (R) 9 9 9 Oral cavity D max 1 1 1 Parotid gland (L) D mean median 6 6 6 Parotid gland (R) 9 7 8 Pituitary gland V 65 Gy 8 8 8 Spinal cord EQD max 45 Gy 6 6 7 Submandibular gland (L) D mean 3 3 3 Submandibular gland (R) 2 2 2 Percentage of OARs meeting dosimetric constraints 70.5% 70.0% 71.2% Priority level No. cases meeting priority constraints P 1 5 5 6 P 2 1 / / / P 3 2 / / / P 4 3 4 2 3 P 5 4 0 0 0 L: left; R: right.

Limbus is the only software solution that does not offer a cloud-based storage; however, this is not a critical limitation, as strict regulations often require hospital-based storage. Differences were observed in the level of customization available for contouring standards – both Limbus and MVision support the development of proprietary hospital models – while a greater variability was noted in the number of supported OARs, with MVision covering the most (32) and MIM the least (18) OARs for the HaN region. All software companies are actively working to expand their functionality, including support for additional OARs, lymph node segmentation, and delineation on cone beam CT (CBCT) and MR images. However, none currently supports multimodal segmentation that combines CT and MR images, despite their common use in HaN RT planning 43 58 Fig. 5 Scatter plots showing the relationship between the distance from the organ-at-risk to the target tissue and various metrics, including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), average Likert rating, average dose (D mean max In line with the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 59 Analytical evaluation The geometric evaluation highlights the well-known observation of the volume dependency of the DSC metric, where smaller organs tend to have lower DSC scores 23 43 60 64 2 Nonetheless, the Likert ratings of the two radiographers presented in the third column in Fig. 4 4 In terms of dosimetric compliance, small OARs generally performed very well. This can be explained by the fact that small boundary deviations – while impactful in geometric terms – rarely translate into significant dosimetric changes. However, this does not apply universally, as the proximity to the target volume and the resulting steep dose gradients can also result in large dosimetric deviations. Conversely, the oral cavity and submandibular glands performed poorly from this perspective. The obtained results are consistent with observations of Koo et al. 51 2 5 1 1 max mean To study the relationships among the triangle of analytical metrics (Fig. 1 5 65 52 61 66 69 4 50 53 Comparison to existing studies For the studies presented in Table 1 S2 S3 S4 S2 19 25 27 S3 27 35 S4 26 43 Limitations and future work One of the limitations of this study is that the image subset may not fully represent the variability in patient anatomies, pathologies, or tumor locations, which could impact algorithm robustness in broader clinical use. While we included cases with diverse clinical challenges to mitigate this issue (i.e. mouth bites and artifacts), additional experiments on datasets spanning different demographics, CT scanners, and clinical conditions are needed to generalize such findings 27 39 51 52 Conclusions Observational evaluation confirmed that all three AI software solutions comply with key regulatory requirements, including rigorous annotation, peer review, and validation processes to ensure segmentation quality. The main comparative differences were observed in the number of supported OARs and the flexibility to adapt segmentation styles to local clinical standards. All software companies are actively advancing their models by incorporating more data and expanding support for additional OARs, lymph nodes, and imaging modalities. The analytical evaluation compared AI auto-segmentations to manually generated reference contours using a triad of metrics: geometric, dosimetric, and psychometric. While overall differences among software solutions were modest, statistically significant differences were observed for certain OARs. Psychometric assessment with Likert ratings indicated that the majority of auto-segmentations were of reasonably good quality. However, manual editing was often indicated for clinical acceptability, particularly for complex structures like the optic chiasm, or in challenging scenarios involving imaging artifacts, the proximity of tumors to OARs, and the presence of mouth bites. Importantly, no clear correlation was observed among geometric, dosimetric, and psychometric metrics, underscoring the limited redundancy among them and highlighting the value of multi-perspective evaluation frameworks.
