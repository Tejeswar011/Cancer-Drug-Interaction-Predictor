Introduction Aspergillosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by molds of the genus Aspergillus 1 Figure 1 2 3 Aspergillus fumigatus 1 4 Aspergillus flavus Aspergillus niger Aspergillus terreus Aspergillus nidulans Aspergillus calidoustus 1 1 A. fumigatus Aspergillus lentulus Aspergillus udagawae Aspergillus viridinutans Aspergillus calidoustus 1 5 1 6 Aspergillus 1 Importantly, severe viral respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 can predispose even non-classically immunocompromised individuals to IA, particularly those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In such cases, IAPA and CAPA have been linked to poor outcomes, with mortality rates often exceeding 50% [ 2 3 6 7 7 8 9 10 Here, we will specifically address three major categories of immunocompromised hosts: people living with HIV, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients with hematologic malignancies or post-HSCT. In addition, we will examine viral-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, with a focus on influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), which have emerged as distinct clinical entities. Although these forms can also occur in patients with classical immunosuppression, they have been increasingly reported in critically ill patients without traditional risk factors, suggesting a broader at-risk population [ 11 2. Microbiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis Species in the filamentous fungal genus Aspergillus 12 Aspergillus A. fumigatus A. flavus A. niger A. terreus A. versicolor A. ustus A. lentulus A. nidulans Emericella nidulans 13 Aspergillus The conidial size of A. fumigatus 14 15 A. flavus 16 A. niger A. terreus A. lentulus A. calidoustus A. fumigatus 17 18 Aspergillus 19 20 Aspergillus 21 CR3 (CD11b/CD18), a pattern recognition receptor expressed on phagocytes, binds fungal chitosan and plays a critical role in orchestrating both phagocytosis and cytokine release in response to Aspergillus 22 23 24 A. fumigatus 25 26 Monocytes migrate into the alveolar space, where they differentiate into monocyte-derived dendritic cells and collaborate with neutrophils to engulf Aspergillus 27 28 Cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in antifungal immunity or allergy-associated tissue damage. Fungal antigens are carried to lymph nodes, where they are processed and presented by antigen-presenting cells, leading to the differentiation of naive CD4 + 29 For the Th17 cells, the differentiation is driven by innate cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23, which activate the lineage-defining transcription factor RORγT (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma T). These Th17 cells secrete IL-17A and IL-22, promoting neutrophil recruitment and strengthening epithelial barrier defenses through the induction of antimicrobial peptides. While Th17 responses contribute to fungal control in the early phases of infection, excessive or prolonged activation may lead to immunopathology and tissue damage. Th2 responses, characterized by IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production, are considered detrimental in IA, as they interfere with protective Th1 activity and may impair antifungal effector mechanisms. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), defined by Foxp3 expression and the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β, act to restrain excessive immune activation and limit tissue damage. However, in the setting of IA, an overabundance or overactivity of Tregs may suppress effective Th1 and Th17 responses, contributing to fungal persistence. These observations highlight the necessity of a balanced adaptive immune response in IA—one that ensures pathogen clearance while preventing immune-mediated injury [ 30 31 29 3. Immunocompromised Patients 3.1. Hematologic Patients The survival rates of patients with hematological malignancies have seen significant improvements due to advancements in medication and supportive therapies, which have also led to a rise in ICU admissions [ 32 These patients are more susceptible to developing serious complications, one of which is invasive fungal infections (IFI) [ 33 A. fumigatus 34 The diagnosis of IFI in hematology patients is associated with the highest mortality [ 35 In Europe, 3.7% of ICU patients had proven or probable IA with an ICU mortality of 87–97% in immunocompromised patients [ 36 37 38 39 All blood malignancies involve the immune system, which promotes the IFI development for T cell dysfunction, hypogammaglobinemia, neutropenia due to bone marrow involvement, and leukopenia due to chemotherapy or BMT. As seen before, neutrophils are the first defense line against fungi: an absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm 3 40 41 A deficiency in lymphocyte production and trafficking and alterations in lymph organ function, second line of defense against fungi, promote IFI in lymphocytic leukemia involving innate and adaptive immunity [ 42 43 In HSCT patients also, the type of immunosuppression can promote an impairment of the host’s defense, and after neutropenia resolution, the development of a graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) may require escalation of immunosuppression therapy, increasing the risk of IFI. Other significant risk factors include renal or liver dysfunction as well as age over 50 years, and they represent the strongest mortality predictors among patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) post induction chemotherapy [ 44 Signs or symptoms are not so specific in an early phase. The challenge in the management of IA in hematologic patients is to early identify high-risk patients through host risk factors, clinical criteria and microbiological criteria to make a presumed diagnosis to start therapy and reduce mortality. A defined diagnosis can be made through autopsy or with a positive culture of Aspergillus The gold standard for diagnosing IA remains culture, as it allows precise identification of the Aspergillus 45 46 For this reason, indirect methods must be introduced, such as detecting galactomannan (GM) or β-D-glucan (BDG) in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay [ 7 A recent systematic review by Bukkems et al. [ 47 Table 1 Without treatment, mortality for IA is 100% in these patients, while with antifungal treatment the overall mortality is between 30% and 40% for AML and 60% for HSCT patients [ 48 3.2. HIV Patients In the absence of treatment, HIV infection can cause marked deterioration of immune function. The degree of immune suppression is directly linked to the emergence of opportunistic infections, particularly when circulating CD4+ lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm 3 49 Fungi belonging to the Aspergillus 50 51 52 In contrast to patients with neutropenia or those undergoing transplantation, in whom the disease typically presents acutely, people with HIV (PWH) often experience more protracted, subacute forms of infection. Nevertheless, both the acute and chronic presentations may carry a significant risk of death [ 53 54 55 56 54 55 53 55 Pneumocystis jirovecii 3 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 In their review, Doumbo et al. [ 64 n n Candida n A study by Truda et al. [ 65 3 3 In a systematic review, Yerbanga IW et al. [ 66 Denning et al. [ 67 3 3.3. Organ Recipients Solid organ transplantation (SOT) has significantly improved the lives of individuals with end-stage organ failure. Despite the success, SOT recipients are at a higher risk of opportunistic infections due to long-term immunosuppression, with IA being a notable cause of morbidity and mortality. The management of IA in SOT recipients remains challenging despite advancements in transplant medicine and antifungal therapies. A study conducted on a cohort of 960 cases with probable or proven IA, as reported in the Prospective Antifungal Therapy Alliance (PATH Alliance) registry, revealed that 48.3% of the individuals had hematologic malignancies, 29.2% were recipients of SOT, 27.9% had undergone HSCT, and 33.8% were neutropenic. Among these patients, the prevalent clinical manifestations of IA included IPA and rhinocerebral aspergillosis [ 68 Despite a decline in mortality rates among transplant recipients in recent years from 65–92% to 22%, it is estimated that approximately 9.3–16.9% of all deaths occurring within the first-year post-transplantation can still be attributed to IA [ 69 3.4. Liver Transplant Recipients Liver transplant (LT) recipients are at risk for IA, with a prevalence of 1.8%, according to recent studies [ 68 70 68 70 71 Despite these improvements, the mortality rates among LT recipients remain higher compared to other transplant procedures [ 72 69 73 74 75 Risk factors for IA in LT recipients include immune system dysregulation induced by bacterial translocation, complement system insufficiency, monocyte suppression, and impaired neutrophil phagocytosis. Management of LT recipients involves reduced levels of immunosuppression, with some individuals potentially achieving immunological tolerance. Corticosteroids have been identified as a risk factor for IA, while calcineurin inhibitors exhibit activities against Aspergillus 76 77 78 Other risk factors for IA in LT recipients include pre-transplant hepatic failure, primary allograft failure or dysfunction, re-transplantation, post-transplant dialysis, and elevated transfusion needs. CMV infection has been associated with a higher likelihood of IA occurring beyond 100 days post-transplantation, and a MELD score exceeding 30 is linked to a heightened risk of developing IFIs [ 73 79 80 81 70 82 83 84 85 69 86 A. fumigatus 87 3.5. Renal Transplant Recipients The occurrence of IA in individuals who have received a kidney transplant (KT) is reported to be between 0.7% and 4% [ 88 89 90 Following SOT, particularly in the initial six months, there is a heightened use of drugs that suppress the immune system. This period is notably vulnerable to opportunistic infections, including IPA [ 91 92 93 Although the risk of post-transplant IPA is lower in KT recipients compared to other transplant recipients, advances in the longevity of KT recipients have led to an increasing number of elderly patients receiving prolonged high levels of immunosuppression [ 94 95 96 3.6. Lung Transplant Recipients In recipients of lung transplant (LT), IA emerges as the most common fungal infection. Historically, the occurrence of this infection in LT patients was estimated to be between 4% and 23%. However, recent research indicates a decline in its prevalence [ 97 98 A. fumigatus Aspergillus 98 The significance of Aspergillus 99 100 Other identified risk factors for IA in LT recipients include bronchial anastomotic leaks, surgical site complications, airway narrowing, allograft dysfunction or ischemia, reperfusion injury, CMV infection, bronchiolitis, and the need for increased immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection [ 100 Ischemic damage at the bronchial anastomotic site can lead to ulcerative tracheobronchitis, a form of IA, and potentially bronchovascular fistulas, which are associated with serious bleeding risks [ 69 100 87 3.7. Heart Transplant Recipients The incidence of IA among heart transplant (HT) recipients is reported to be between 1% and 14%, with the risks for developing this condition differing based on whether it occurs early or later after the transplant. Factors such as undergoing hemodialysis, needing thoracic surgery again, and increased levels of immunosuppressive drugs are linked to a higher likelihood of developing IA among these patients. Not all patients with IA will show signs of neutropenia, making it essential to diagnose the condition through clinical observation and imaging results. The most common presentation of IA in this group is IPA, particularly within the first three months following a HT. On the other hand, cases of IA that arise later tend to show a wider spread of the disease, including to the CNS and other areas outside the lungs [ 100 101 102 103 A 2006 study highlighted a one-year post-diagnosis mortality rate of 67% among HT patients with IA [ 104 102 4. Coinfections 4.1. COVID-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA) Historically, the development of pulmonary aspergillosis was mainly linked to specific conditions of profound immunosuppression, such as hematologic malignancies, stem cell transplantation, cytotoxic therapies, or prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants. More recently, the spectrum of risk factors has widened to include inherited immunodeficiencies and reduced lymphocyte subsets [ 58 105 The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new clinical scenarios. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is now recognized to induce complex immune dysregulation, affecting both T helper 1 and 2 responses [ 106 107 108 109 9 110 111 Montrucchio et al. highlighted the relevance of prolonged respiratory support, both invasive and non-invasive, which is commonly required in severe COVID-19, as a potential risk factor for CAPA [ 112 113 114 Environmental and logistical challenges in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic—such as high patient volume, altered ventilation systems, structural renovations, and extended use of isolation rooms—might also have played a role in promoting fungal colonization and infection. Chavda et al. reported a high prevalence of opportunistic fungal infections among COVID-19 patients, particularly in the elderly population [ 115 116 117 118 119 The diagnosis of CAPA remains challenging, primarily due to its clinical and radiological resemblance to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, conventional diagnostic markers such as serum galactomannan may show reduced sensitivity in non-neutropenic patients, as neutrophils can clear fungal antigens from the bloodstream before detection [ 120 Two years after the onset of the pandemic, numerous epidemiological and observational studies continue to emphasize the clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 in predisposing patients to secondary fungal infections. The emergence of these coinfections appears to be strongly influenced by the use of mechanical ventilation, intravascular catheters, and immunosuppressive therapies [ 121 4.2. Influenza-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IAPA) Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is an emerging complication of influenza infection, often associated with Aspergillus 122 123 11 124 2 11 122 125 11 124 125 Aspergillus Aspergillus 126 126 Aspergillus 127 128 125 122 125 122 129 5. Diagnosis Because of the paucity of clinical signs and the limited sensitivity and/or specificity of radiology and mycological tests, the diagnosis of IPA is graded according to a scale of probability (possible, probable or proven) of disease [ 46 130 131 132 Aspergillus It is pertinent to mention that the updated 2019 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/MSGERC) consensus definitions for invasive fungal disease (IFD) now include: (i) Aspergillus Aspergillus 45 The 2020 Committee’s update tried to incorporate all these new findings [ 7 133 134 Figure 2 For IFI, as well as for aspergillosis, the definitions assigned three levels of probability to the diagnosis: for proven infection, it is necessary to confirm the presence of fungi in a sterile material during the microscopic exam with alterations in tissue structure as illustrated in Figure 3 For probable infection, the presence of at least one host factor, one clinical criterion and one mycological criterion is required, while the absence of mycological criteria classified the case as possible infection. It is important to underline that these guidelines refer to the immunocompromised population and not to the subset of critically ill patients in the ICU who do not fulfil the EORTC/MSG host factors [ 45 The population of non-neutropenic, critically ill adult patients is highly heterogenous, including medical and surgical patients, with a wide range of baseline comorbidities and predisposing conditions for IFD (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long-term steroid therapy, hepatic cirrhosis, dialysis, near drowning, or diabetes, sepsis due to bacterial, viral, or parasitic agents, and severe postsepsis immunoparalysis) [ 68 133 Aspergillus 7 133 134 Aspergillus 7 133 134 More recently, to overcome the limitations of AspICU and to further refine the diagnostic classification in ICU settings, the Invasive Fungal Diseases in Adult Patients in ICU (FUNDICU) project was conceived with the aim of developing a standard set of definitions for IFD in non-neutropenic, ICU patients outside the classical immunocompromised patient populations, which could improve the generalizability and comparability of research results [ 68 68 Table 2 The gold standard for diagnosing aspergillosis is a sterile sample biopsy obtained through bronchoscopy, surgical procedure, or trans-thoracic needle. These procedures can have some executive limitations due to hemodynamic instability, coagulation disorders, or respiratory failure of these patients [ 124 133 134 For this reason, the diagnosis should start with the clinical evaluation of patients (host factors, symptoms, and signs of presentation), followed by the execution of diagnostic tests to confirm or not the probability of having aspergillosis. Usually, clinical presentation involves the pulmonary system with cough, respiratory distress, and dyspnea. Fever and resistance to antibiotics is another sign that is not specific. Chest pain or hemoptysis are frequent in case of angio-invasive growth, which can promote the dissemination to other organs: CNS with convulsions, meningitis, and other clinical manifestations with a bad prognosis [ 135 The role of imaging is to detect typical features to make an early diagnosis of IPA, evaluate the progression, and detect complications. Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred method of diagnosis and follow-up. A non-contrast CT was performed initially, but the contrast is necessary to detect the angio-invasion in the lesion. Radiologic presentation varies about the immune status of patients. Specifically, pulmonary nodules can be observed in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients, with a distribution reflecting the infection’s behavior (airway invasive or angioinvasive). These nodules may be associated with a halo sign, which, though not specific, serves as an early radiological indicator, particularly in the presence of host risk factors such as neutropenia. The halo sign has a high positive predictive value for diagnosing IPA and is associated with a favorable prognosis. The cavitation or air crescent sign appears later in the infection and is indicative of immune recovery. Other radiologic features linked to pulmonary nodules include hypodense signs and transfissural extension. Consolidation, with or without the reverse halo (atoll) sign or vascular occlusion sign, is another pattern observed in neutropenic patients, though it is not exclusively associated with aspergillosis [ 136 137 138 GM is a polysaccharide in the cell wall of Aspergillus Aspergillus A positive serum result should be based on a cut-off GM index ≥ 0.5 after testing two separate serum samples or a single sample with a value of ≥1.0 [ 139 A positive result on BAL fluid should be based on a cut-off GM index ≥ 1.0 after testing two aliquots of a single BAL fluid sample [ 140 140 Results have shown that patients without clinical signs have tested positive for GM, including those who were taking piperacillin/tazobactam, beta-lactams, and other antibiotics. Additionally, patients who were receiving total parenteral nutrition or crystalloid solutions also had false-positive GM results. Furthermore, patients with mucositis or an altered intestinal barrier displayed false-positive GM results due to dietary factors or glucose-containing solutions [ 141 1,3-BDG is a cell wall component; it is not specific for Aspergillus ® Limulus ® Candida albicans Candida 142 False positives are frequent in patients receiving albumin, hemodialysis with cellulose membranes, intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. PCR-based methods could be applied to any specimen, showing high sensitivity and specificity for detecting Aspergillus Aspergillus ® ® Aspergillus Aspergillus 143 A novel lateral flow device using an Aspergillus Aspergillus Penicillium Table 3 Novel biomarkers or targets based on IA pathogenesis have been studied to discriminate Aspergillus 144 Another biomarker is triacetyl-fusarinine C (TAFC), a fungal molecule produced by some molds. One of these is A. fumigatus 145 In case of suspected fungal pneumonia, Aspergillus 146 Proteome analysis of BAL shows host and fungal proteins expressed during IPA, which in the future can represent novel biomarkers in Aspergillus 147 6. Antifungal Prophylaxis and Pre-Emptive Treatment Versus Antifungal Therapy The rising number of immunocompromised individuals has led to an increased risk of IFIs, which are associated with a high mortality rate due to various complications. The development of novel chemotherapy agents and immunosuppressive drugs has improved outcomes but also increased susceptibility to IFIs [ 148 All of these factors must be taken into account when assessing a high-risk patient, in order to establish a treatment plan that selects the appropriate therapeutic regimen. This includes choosing the right drug based on its potential drug-drug interactions, efficacy, tolerability, and toxicity, while taking into account emerging pharmacological resistance and the introduction of drugs targeting novel molecular and immune pathways [ 10 149 In certain cases, antifungal prophylaxis may be considered for patients without signs or symptoms of fungal disease. It is essential to balance the risk of drug-induced side effects and resistance with the potential benefits in terms of increased survival rates. Pre-emptive treatment involves administering antifungal therapy to a population based on laboratory tests that indicate early signs of IFD. Empiric treatment, on the other hand, is administered to patients at risk of fungal infection who present with fever as a sign or symptom of IFD [ 10 Different antifungal treatments are available against Aspergillus 150 150 151 152 10 153 151 154 Echinocandins such as caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin, available in intravenous formulation, are not recommended as first-line agents but as salvage therapy or in combination with other drugs [ 155 156 Combination therapy is a strategy to improve patient outcomes and overcome antifungal resistance, which is often caused by mutations in the target site of triazoles (CYP51A). These mutations can occur due to prolonged therapy or in regions where azoles are used on agricultural products [ 154 155 156 In the treatment of aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients, we should consider the different antifungal treatment approaches, evaluate the efficacy of trials of specific drugs in this particular setting, and consider the pharmacological aspect of the available drugs to minimize pharmacological exposure and limit adverse effects [ 157 7. Antifungal Resistance 7.1. Amphotericin B Amphotericin B exerts its antifungal activity by binding to sterols, particularly ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane. This interaction disrupts membrane integrity through the formation of transmembrane pores, leading to increased permeability and the consequent leakage of intracellular ions and cytoplasmic contents. This membrane dysfunction ultimately results in fungal cell death. Additionally, amphotericin B may induce oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), further contributing to cellular damage [ 158 159 160 Among non- fumigatus Aspergillus A. terreus A. flavus A. fumigatus 158 7.2. Azoles Since the late 2000s, azole resistance in A. fumigatus 149 161 162 163 Azoles act by inhibiting lanosterol 14α-demethylase, an enzyme encoded by the cyp51A gene, which is essential for ergosterol biosynthesis. Inhibition leads to the accumulation of toxic 14α-methyl sterols, compromising membrane structure and function, and ultimately impairing fungal growth [ 149 161 162 Mutations in cyp51A—especially nonsynonymous point mutations—are strongly associated with azole resistance. These mutations can reduce drug binding or uptake, conferring variable resistance profiles [ 149 161 162 Due to the natural process of asexual sporulation, A. fumigatus 149 161 162 7.3. Echinocandins Echinocandins inhibit β-(1,3)-D-glucan synthase, an enzyme involved in fungal cell wall synthesis. Against Aspergillus Aspergillus 158 164 8. Conclusions In recent years, our understanding of pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients has significantly evolved. This narrative review highlights the emergence of new host populations at risk—including non-neutropenic ICU patients and individuals with viral infections such as COVID-19 and influenza—who present with atypical forms of invasive aspergillosis. Diagnostic approaches have progressed beyond traditional culture-based methods, combining different tools such as galactomannan, 1,3-β-D-glucan, PCR, and lateral flow assays. Nevertheless, significant diagnostic delays persist, especially in non-classical hosts, due to limitations in specificity and accessibility of these tools in critically ill patients. Currently, treatment options for invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) remain limited, and resistance to existing antifungal agents is increasingly common among pathogenic fungi. In particular, the emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus 158 A. fumigatus 165 The growing threat of azole resistance in A. fumigatus fumigatus Aspergillus A new promising drug, Olorofim, has been developed. It is the first antifungal agent in the orotomide class and has demonstrated activity against fungi resistant to approved treatments. It acts by disrupting fungal pyrimidine biosynthesis, ultimately causing cell death. Preliminary data showed the efficacy and the safety of Olorofim for the treatment of IFD in patients with few or no treatment options [ 166 Ultimately, improving outcomes for immunocompromised patients with aspergillosis demands a multidisciplinary approach: integrating early risk stratification, timely use of molecular diagnostics, and personalized antifungal treatment. Future research should prioritize prospective studies in emerging risk groups, standardized diagnostic criteria for ICU populations, and strategies to mitigate antifungal resistance globally.

Various criteria have been proposed for diagnosing probable aspergillosis in different patient populations. Modified AspICU criteria 2021 and FUNDICU criteria 2024 are applied to non-immunocompromised individuals. The EORTC/MSGERC criteria are used for immunocompromised patients and rely on a combination of host factors, clinical and radiological evidence, and microbiological and histopathological findings to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis. For a proven diagnosis of aspergillosis, identification of Aspergillus Figure 3 Direct microscopic diagnosis of IA in three immunocompromised patients.
