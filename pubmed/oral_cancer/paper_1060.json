Introduction In recent decades, the scientific community has paid increasing attention to the complex relationship between oxidative stress, inflammation, and the development of chronic diseases [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 The main goal of this review is to explore the connections between oxidative stress and inflammation, with an emphasis on how nutraceuticals can influence these processes. We will review recent research on various antioxidant compounds including polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and other bioactive molecules, and their impact on oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, this review will discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrating nutraceuticals into clinical practice, with a focus on their bioavailability, optimal dosages, and potential for personalized treatments. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking oxidative stress and inflammation, while highlighting promising nutraceutical interventions that could lead to new strategies for preventing and managing chronic diseases. The interplay between oxidative stress, antioxidants, and inflammation forms a dynamic network that influences the progression of disease. On the one hand, ROS are critical for immune signaling and play a significant role in activating inflammatory pathways. However, when ROS production exceeds the body’s ability to neutralize them, it leads to tissue damage, amplifying the inflammatory response and fostering disease development. In this context, antioxidants play a pivotal role in breaking this harmful cycle. By scavenging ROS, antioxidants help mitigate oxidative damage and reduce inflammation, offering a protective mechanism [ 5 8 9 Additionally, certain antioxidants have been shown to influence inflammation directly. For example, polyphenolic compounds such as curcumin and resveratrol have been shown to inhibit the activation of key inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, which are involved in cytokine production [ 10 11 Although traditional pharmacological treatments are common, they often lead to side effects and may not target the underlying causes of these diseases. Consequently, interest in natural compounds with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties has grown recently as potential therapeutic options [ 12 13 2. Oxidative Stress: Mechanisms and Pathophysiology 2.1. Endogenous Sources The formation of intracellular free radicals in mitochondria and peroxides occurs due to basic metabolism during normal oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for ATP generation ( Table 1 14 Highly reactive molecules of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) promote random damage to cellular structures, leading to cell death by interrupting the physiological functions of key biomolecules [ 8 2 2 2 − − ATP is produced in mitochondria through energy conversion in a usable form by cells. In this process, oxidative phosphorylation involves the electron transport chain in which hydrogen ions are moved across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons pass through a series of redox-active proteins, each having a higher reduction potential than the last, eventually reducing oxygen to water. However, approximately 1–3% of electrons leak, leading to the premature and partial reduction of oxygen and the formation of O 2 − 6 15 Enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions produce superoxide radicals and are highly reactive.

Exogenous Sources Environmental and external factors play a significant role in causing oxidative stress by increasing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the body ( Figure 1 2 − 2 − 2 2 2 2 2 − 2 32 2.3. Impact of Oxidative Stress on Cellular Structures and Functions The harmful effects of oxidative stress on cellular structures are significant. ROS and RNS can directly damage lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, resulting in structural and functional abnormalities. Lipid peroxidation, a process in which ROS attack lipid membranes, produces toxic aldehydes that can compromise cell membrane integrity and fluidity. This disruption can hinder cell signaling and lead to cellular dysfunction [ 33 Protein oxidation occurs when ROS modifies amino acid side chains, resulting in changes to protein structure and function. This can lead to the loss of enzyme activity, disrupted protein–protein interactions, and the buildup of misfolded proteins, which are often linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s [ 34 35 Furthermore, oxidative stress has a significant impact on cellular signaling pathways. For example, ROS activates transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which regulate the expression of genes involved in inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis [ 36 Oxidative stress is also a key factor in aging and age-related diseases. As the body’s antioxidant defenses weaken with age, the accumulation of oxidative damage to cellular components plays a significant role in the aging process and the development of age-associated conditions, such as atherosclerosis, cataracts, and neurodegeneration. In particular, mitochondria, which are the primary source of ROS, undergo damage over time, resulting in impaired energy production and increased ROS generation, which creates a vicious cycle of mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular aging [ 37 38 Future research should continue exploring new antioxidant-based treatments and strategies to enhance the body’s natural defenses, ultimately leading to better health outcomes despite oxidative stress and its related conditions. 2.4. Endogenous Antioxidant Defense Systems (Enzymatic and Non-Enzymatic) The endogenous antioxidant defense system consists of a carefully regulated balance between enzymatic and non-enzymatic molecules, acting as the first line of defense against redox imbalance and oxidative damage ( Table 2 39 2 − 2 2 2 2 Importantly, each enzyme requires specific cofactors to work. SOD types need manganese, copper, or zinc, while CAT contains a heme iron center, and GPx activity depends on selenium. Changes in the levels or activity of these enzymes are associated with various health issues, including neurodegeneration, cancer progression, and heart problems. Recent studies indicate that increasing SOD activity or administering CAT through gene therapy can reduce neuronal damage after ischemia and lower infarct size [ 40 41 Non-enzymatic antioxidants, including GSH, α-lipoic acid, melatonin, uric acid, bilirubin, and coenzyme Q10, work by directly scavenging free radicals or restoring oxidized antioxidants. GSH, a tripeptide made up of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine, functions as a key redox buffer and serves as a substrate for GPx. In conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, GSH depletion is linked to increased ROS levels and neuronal cell death. Supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or liposomal GSH has shown promising results in restoring cellular redox balance [ 42 43 Melatonin, mainly produced by the pineal gland, has notable antioxidant effects that go beyond regulating the sleep–wake cycle. Its amphiphilic nature enables it to cross cell membranes easily and gather within mitochondria, where it combats oxidative stress and prevents the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Clinical studies have shown its potential to improve outcomes in cases of sepsis, ischemic injuries, and even post-COVID-19 fatigue [ 44 Although substantial experimental evidence supports the effectiveness of endogenous antioxidant systems, their clinical use is limited by pharmacokinetic challenges, including low oral bioavailability, poor tissue targeting, and a short half-life. Additionally, systemic antioxidant administration can disrupt normal redox signaling, emphasizing the need for interventions tailored to specific contexts. Advances include nano-formulated antioxidants, prodrug strategies, and redox phenotype-guided therapies. Personalized antioxidant approaches that consider disease stage, genetic background, and redox status could improve treatment outcomes. 2.5. Role of Antioxidants in Organ Protection Oxidative stress is a common pathogenic mechanism that connects metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal injury, and neurodegeneration. Antioxidants, both natural and synthetic, exert protective effects by neutralizing ROS, maintaining redox balance, and regulating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. The cardiovascular system is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress due to continuous exposure to oxidized lipoproteins and vascular inflammation. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C, polyphenols (resveratrol, curcumin, green tea catechins), and pharmacological agents with antioxidant activity (e.g., statins, probucol) reduce LDL oxidation, improve endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability, and attenuate atherogenesis [ 45 46 47 48 The kidney is also vulnerable to ROS-mediated damage in both acute and chronic injury. Antioxidants, including N-acetylcysteine, curcumin, and green tea polyphenols, reduce ischemia–reperfusion injury, attenuate tubular apoptosis, and decrease proteinuria in experimental nephropathy [ 49 50 The gastrointestinal mucosa is continuously exposed to dietary oxidants, microbial metabolites, and inflammatory mediators. Flavonoids, carotenoids, and vitamins (C and E) strengthen mucosal defenses by enhancing epithelial barrier integrity, scavenging ROS, and suppressing NF-κB activation [ 51 52 53 54 55 The brain consumes high amounts of oxygen and is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which makes it very vulnerable to lipid peroxidation and oxidative injury. Natural antioxidants such as polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and coenzyme Q10, as well as synthetic antioxidants, have shown neuroprotective effects by preventing protein aggregation, reducing mitochondrial dysfunction, and suppressing neuroinflammation [ 56 57 58 59 In summary, antioxidants play a crucial role in protecting vital organs from oxidative stress–induced injury. Their multifaceted actions on redox signaling, inflammation, and apoptosis highlight their potential as supportive therapeutics in preventing and managing metabolic and degenerative diseases. 3. Inflammation and Its Crosstalk with Oxidative Stress Inflammation and oxidative stress are closely connected biological processes that play a central role in the development of many chronic diseases. Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between the production of ROS and antioxidant defenses, can trigger various inflammatory pathways, including the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. NF-κB is a key transcription factor that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby amplifying the inflammatory response [ 37 60 61 62 4. The NRF2–Keap1 Pathway and Its Cross-Talk with Inflammatory Signaling The nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) is a key transcription factor that controls the expression of a wide range of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. Under normal conditions, NRF2 is kept in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which marks it for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. When cells face oxidative stress or electrophilic compounds, critical cysteine residues in Keap1 become modified, causing conformational changes that reduce NRF2 ubiquitination. This stabilization allows NRF2 to accumulate and move into the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of target genes [ 63 64 Importantly, the NRF2–Keap1 pathway does not operate alone but interacts with pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, especially the NF-κB pathway. Oxidative stress strongly activates NF-κB, whereas NRF2 activation counteracts this by lowering ROS levels and inhibiting NF-κB–dependent gene expression ( Figure 2 65 66 Figure 2 Dysregulated NRF2–Keap1 signaling has been linked to the development of chronic diseases marked by oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Therefore, therapeutic approaches aimed at activating NRF2, such as electrophilic compounds, natural antioxidants like curcumin and sulforaphane, and synthetic derivatives, are actively being explored for their potential to restore redox balance and reduce inflammatory injury [ 64 67 68 Under resting conditions, nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) is held in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Oxidative or conformational changes in Keap1 prevent NRF2 from being ubiquitinated, allowing NRF2 to stabilize and accumulate in the nucleus. Once inside, NRF2 forms a heterodimer with small Maf proteins and binds to antioxidant response element (ARE) sequences to activate a wide range of cytoprotective genes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis. These gene products work together to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), repair oxidative damage, and facilitate detoxification, thus maintaining redox and metabolic balance. Simultaneously, inflammatory signals activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), promoting the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators. The NRF2 and NF-κB pathways interact through bidirectional cross-talk. Activation of NRF2 reduces NF-κB–driven inflammation, whereas chronic inflammatory signals can impair NRF2 activity through post-translational and transcriptional mechanisms. Disruption of this balance due to abnormal Keap1 activity, genetic mutations, persistent oxidative or inflammatory stress, or mitochondrial dysfunction weakens ARE-dependent defenses, leading to excessive ROS buildup, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, DNA strand breaks, and compromised detoxification capacity. These processes drive the development and progression of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders, chronic kidney disease, and cancer.

Types and Mechanisms of Antioxidants Nutraceutical and pharmacological antioxidants are crucial in combating oxidative stress, a condition associated with the development of numerous chronic diseases. Nutraceutical antioxidants, derived from natural dietary sources such as flavonoids, vitamins, and carotenoids, help neutralize free radicals and support the body’s natural defense mechanisms. Conversely, pharmacological antioxidants are synthetically created to enhance their antioxidant effects through improved stability, increased bioavailability, and enhanced cellular targeting. These agents have demonstrated promising results in managing oxidative damage related to aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular conditions [ 69 70 5.1. Nutraceuticals Nutraceuticals are substances that offer medicinal or health benefits beyond their nutritional content. The term “nutraceutical” is derived from the combination of “nutrition” and “pharmaceuticals.” These compounds, found in functional foods, contain biologically active molecules that interact with various cellular targets across organ systems. Their effects include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antimicrobial, and cholesterol-lowering properties [ 71 72 73 55 74 75 76 5.1.1. Antioxidant Nutraceuticals Dietary antioxidants work synergistically with endogenous antioxidants to neutralize ROS and RNS. Their deficiency is associated with chronic and degenerative diseases. These compounds are structurally diverse and include a range of various molecules. 5.1.2. Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C, is an essential water-soluble antioxidant that humans cannot synthesize endogenously, unlike most animals and plants, making its dietary intake essential [ 77 Biologically, it plays a crucial role in normal growth and development and is involved in multiple physiological functions [ 78 79 Vitamin C also regenerates other antioxidants such as vitamin E, contributes to collagen biosynthesis, improves iron absorption, and modulates cellular signal transduction. Donating hydrogen reduces tocopherol radicals, thereby restoring the antioxidant function of tocopherol and protecting membrane lipids. Moreover, it reduces the Fenton reaction by neutralizing metal ions that would otherwise promote the formation of free radicals. In plants, ascorbic acid serves as a substrate for ascorbate peroxidase (APX), playing a crucial role in resistance to oxidative stress [ 80 5.1.3. Tocopherols (Vitamin E) It is a group of phenolic compounds containing eight related tocopherols and tocotrienols known as vitamin E. It is a family of lipid-soluble vitamins. The most famous compound of this class is alpha-tocopherol, which has the highest bioavailability, allowing the body to absorb and metabolize it easily. The primary function of alpha-tocopherol is to protect membranes from oxidation, as it inhibits lipid peroxidation by interacting with lipid radicals generated from peroxynitrite and inflammatory reactions [ 81 82 83 5.1.4. Carotenoids Carotenoids fall under a large group of molecules called terpenes that are formed by isoprene chains with conjugated double bonds and are fat-soluble [ 84 2 Carotenoids are also known for their ability to reduce radicals by donating electrons and hydrogen. They form when hydrogen atoms are donated to lipid peroxyl radicals. These radicals react with lipid peroxyl radicals, leading to the formation of non-radical carotene peroxides. Carotene radicals are also prone to molecular-oxygen addition and subsequent reaction with another carotene molecule, producing carotene epoxides and carbonylated carotene compounds. One of the most stable carotene radicals is the β-carotene radical because of the delocalization of its unpaired electron within the conjugated polyene structure [ 85 86 5.1.5. Phenolics and Flavonoids Plant polyphenols form a broad class of phenolic compounds, the most prominent being flavonoids flavones and flavonols. These molecules exhibit strong antioxidant activity by effectively scavenging superoxide anions, nitric oxide, and hydroxyl radicals [ 87 Once incorporated into biological membranes, polyphenols insert into the hydrophobic core and slow the oxidation of lipids and proteins; membrane-embedded flavonoids further protect bilayer integrity by physically blocking the entry of ROS and RNS. Dietary sources such as green tea, red grape skins (used in red wine), apples, cocoa, ginkgo biloba, soy, turmeric, various berries, onions, and broccoli are all associated with decreased inflammation and oxidative stress [ 88 6. Fatty Acids as Modulators of Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Pathways Fatty acids exert important regulatory effects on oxidative stress and inflammation through multiple mechanisms [ 89 90 Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially omega-3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), serve as natural ligands for PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ. Upon activation, PPARs heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and regulate target genes involved in lipid metabolism and redox control. In addition, PPARs exert anti-inflammatory effects by trans-repression of NF-κB signaling. Mechanisms include sequestration of coactivators such as CBP/p300, stabilization of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, and recruitment of corepressors to NF-κB target promoters. Experimental studies show that oxidized omega-3 fatty acids inhibit NF-κB activation via a PPARα-dependent mechanism, underscoring their dual role in lipid and inflammatory homeostasis [ 91 Moreover, PPAR activation complements NRF2 signaling. Both pathways work together to increase antioxidant enzymes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase. Studies in metabolic and toxicological models indicate that co-activation of PPARγ and NRF2 provides synergistic protection against oxidative damage, thereby reducing secondary NF-κB activation [ 92 Omega-3 PUFAs also activate GPR120 (also known as FFAR4), a membrane receptor highly expressed in macrophages and adipocytes. GPR120 signaling inhibits NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation while promoting a shift toward an anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype [ 93 94 Electrophilic derivatives of unsaturated fatty acids, such as nitro-oleic acid and other nitro-fatty acids, activate both PPARs and NRF2 by covalently modifying cysteine residues in Keap1. This results in the upregulation of antioxidant genes and inhibition of NF-κB signaling, highlighting a direct link between lipid electrophiles and cytoprotective transcriptional responses [ 95 Clinical data support the anti-inflammatory potential of omega-3 PUFAs, though outcomes vary by formulation and population. A randomized dose–response trial demonstrated that EPA and DHA supplementation modulate innate immune responses and reduce ex vivo endotoxin-stimulated cytokine release [ 96 97 98 99 99 7. Synthetic and Pharmacological Antioxidants: Mechanisms of Action Synthetic and pharmacological antioxidants have been developed to imitate or enhance the body’s natural antioxidant defenses, especially in cases of diseases related to oxidative stress [ 100 100 The mechanisms of action of these antioxidants are complex. One primary mechanism is free radical scavenging, in which these compounds donate electrons to neutralize ROS and RNS, thereby preventing lipid peroxidation and DNA damage [ 16 8 101 Furthermore, recent studies have shown that certain pharmacological antioxidants exert their effects by modulating gene expression. Compounds such as dimethyl fumarate and resveratrol analogs activate the Nrf2 pathway, a transcription factor that upregulates ARE-driven genes, including those encoding for glutathione peroxidase and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase [ 102 These diverse mechanisms underscore the potential of synthetic and pharmacological antioxidants, not only as direct radical scavengers but also as regulators of cellular antioxidant systems and gene expression pathways. 8. Anti-Inflammatory Agents with Antioxidant Properties In recent years, scientific interest has grown in bioactive phytochemicals that have both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Notably, compounds like curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin have gained significant attention for their multiple effects in regulating immune responses and redox homeostasis [ 103 Curcumin, a polyphenol from Curcuma longa, is well-known for its diverse biological effects. It serves as a potent scavenger of ROS and RNS, thereby decreasing cellular oxidative damage. At the same time, curcumin reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, primarily by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. This inhibition lessens the activation of inflammation-related genes and helps regulate the immune response to harmful stimuli. Additionally, curcumin stimulates the Nrf2 pathway, promoting the production of protective enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which play crucial roles in mitigating oxidative stress [ 104 Resveratrol, a stilbene compound predominantly found in grapes and red wine, exhibits similar dual activities. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that resveratrol reduces oxidative stress by enhancing the activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx [ 105 106 107 Quercetin, a flavonoid abundantly present in onions, apples, and tea, also exerts dual functionality by influencing oxidative and inflammatory pathways. It effectively inhibits lipid peroxidation and ROS generation, while concurrently suppressing the expression of key inflammatory mediators. Similar to curcumin and resveratrol, quercetin inhibits the NF-κB pathway and downregulates MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling cascades, including ERK, JNK, and p38, leading to reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 108 109 The immunomodulatory effects of these compounds are not restricted to cytokine modulation but also extend to cellular interactions within the immune system. For instance, curcumin inhibits dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation, while promoting the expansion of Tregs. Resveratrol enhances macrophage polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype [ 110 111 Furthermore, these dual-function agents interfere with intracellular signaling pathways that control cellular responses to stress and inflammation. The interplay between NF-κB, Nrf2, and MAPK pathways constitutes a central node targeted by these compounds. By inhibiting NF-κB and activating Nrf2, these agents shift the cellular response from a pro-inflammatory to an antioxidative and cytoprotective state. This dual modulation not only reduces inflammatory damage but also improves resilience against oxidative injury. In conclusion, dual-function compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin show significant potential as therapeutic agents due to their ability to modulate both inflammation and oxidative stress simultaneously. Their influence on key signaling pathways and immune functions highlights the importance of these natural compounds in preventing and managing chronic inflammatory diseases. Future research should focus on improving their bioavailability and investigating the synergistic effects through combination therapy strategies. 9. Clinical Applications and Evidence of Antioxidants and Anti-Inflammatory Agents An increasing number of preclinical and clinical studies highlight the significant therapeutic potential of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in combating diseases mediated by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. These compounds, particularly polyphenols such as curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin, are of high interest due to their ability to act on both oxidative and inflammatory pathways. For instance, curcumin demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB activation and reducing the expression of COX-2, IL-1β, and TNF-α. In animal models of atherosclerosis, curcumin has been shown to decrease oxidative stress markers such as MDA and boost antioxidant enzyme activities, including SOD and catalase [ 112 Similarly, resveratrol exerts cardioprotective effects by activating SIRT1 and AMPK, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, and reducing ROS generation. Preclinical models of myocardial infarction and cerebral ischemia have demonstrated that resveratrol attenuates infarct size, improves neurological function, and inhibits the release of pro-apoptotic factors. Quercetin has been extensively studied for its ability to restore redox balance by modulating glutathione levels, reducing lipid peroxidation, and suppressing inflammatory cytokines via inhibition of MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways [ 113 Clinical evidence, although still emerging, reflects many of these beneficial outcomes ( Table 3 114 Beyond curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin, several other agents with dual antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are currently being evaluated in clinical settings ( Table 3 L-carnitine supplementation combined with exercise has also shown synergistic effects in overweight/obese adults, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity (CAT, SOD) and reducing ROS, MDA, and IL-6 levels, highlighting the importance of lifestyle-drug combinations. Moreover, eriocitrin, a citrus-derived flavonoid, demonstrated significant reductions in glycemia, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, while also enhancing GLP-1 secretion in prediabetic individuals. In addition to nutraceuticals, novel pharmacological agents are emerging. Sonlicromanol (KH176), a redox-modulating drug, has been shown to improve mitochondrial redox balance and mood in patients with mitochondrial disease. In contrast, GC-4419, an SOD mimetic, is currently being tested in oncology for its dual antioxidant and anti-tumor potential. Crisdesalazine and AT-001 are also being investigated for neurodegenerative and brain oxidative stress–related disorders, respectively, underscoring a growing pipeline of clinically oriented redox-active compounds. Together, these examples demonstrate that while classical polyphenols remain central to antioxidant–anti-inflammatory research, newer compounds, pharmacological agents, and combination approaches are expanding the therapeutic landscape. However, challenges such as poor bioavailability, short half-life, and inter-individual variability remain common obstacles across these agents, necessitating improved formulations and more rigorous translational efforts. 10. Challenges and Limitations Despite promising results, several challenges limit the clinical translation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents. Classical compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin are constrained by poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and inconsistent outcomes across clinical trials. Similarly, newer agents face their own barriers. Astaxanthin, although a potent radical scavenger, has also some bioavailability issues, and its long-term cardiovascular safety remains unclear [ 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 Collectively, these limitations highlight the need for improved delivery systems, precision-medicine strategies, and well-designed long-term clinical trials to establish reliable therapeutic roles for these agents. Beyond pharmacological limitations, individual variability in therapeutic response is also a critical factor affecting clinical outcomes. Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP450 isoforms), variation in gut microbiota composition, and differing baseline levels of oxidative stress or inflammation may influence the effectiveness and safety of antioxidant interventions [ 125 126 127 128 11. Reconciling Discrepancies Between Preclinical and Clinical Outcomes in Oxidative Stress Modulation Despite the strong evidence that antioxidant interventions are effective in preclinical models, clinical trials often show minimal or inconsistent effects on oxidative stress biomarkers. Several connected factors contribute to this gap in translation. First, inadequate dosing and pharmacokinetic limitations restrict clinical effectiveness. Many trials use doses that do not reach tissue levels comparable to those in animal or in vitro studies. Non-enzymatic antioxidants often react more slowly with reactive species, such as superoxide, at rates significantly lower than those of nitric oxide, which substantially reduces their effectiveness in living organisms [ 6 129 130 131 132 12. Emerging Strategies and Future Directions 12.1. Combination Therapies: Synergistic Targeting of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Given the complex interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation in the development of chronic diseases, combination therapies that target both pathways simultaneously have shown promising results. Using antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents together can create synergistic effects, resulting in increased effectiveness and fewer side effects compared to using either therapy alone. For instance, a combination of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and curcumin significantly reduced oxidative damage and neuroinflammation in models of Alzheimer’s disease by lowering neuronal apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β [ 133 134 135 12.2. Targeted Delivery Systems: Nanotechnology-Driven Precision in Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Therapy Pharmacokinetic limitations, including poor aqueous solubility, rapid degradation, and nonspecific tissue distribution, often hinder the clinical translation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. To address these challenges, nanotechnology-based delivery systems have emerged as a highly promising strategy, offering enhanced bioavailability, sustained release, and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. Liposomal delivery systems, composed of biocompatible phospholipid bilayers, have demonstrated strong potential for encapsulating both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. For example, curcumin-loaded liposomes have been shown to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy in experimental colitis by enhancing mucosal retention and reducing systemic toxicity compared to free curcumin [ 136 Polymeric nanoparticles, such as those made from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), enable controlled release and protection of unstable bioactive compounds. Quercetin has demonstrated improved solubility, bioavailability, and cellular uptake when delivered via PLGA nanoparticles, resulting in better outcomes in models of hepatic oxidative stress [ 137 Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are lipid-based nanocarriers offering enhanced encapsulation efficiency, stability, and scalability. SLNs loaded with resveratrol were found to effectively protect neuronal cells from ROS-induced apoptosis by facilitating mitochondrial delivery and sustained intracellular release [ 138 139 12.3. Personalized Medicine and Biomarkers: Toward Precision Redox Therapy Advancements in personalized medicine have opened new ways to customize antioxidant and anti-inflammatory treatments based on individual biomarker profiles. Biomarkers such as 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and TNF-α serve as indicators of oxidative damage and inflammatory status. Multi-omics technologies now enable the integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data to guide personalized therapy. Elevated levels of urinary 8-OHdG, for example, have been used to predict oxidative DNA damage and assess response to antioxidant therapies for cardiovascular patients. The combination of biomarker monitoring and computational tools can further refine treatment protocols, leading to more effective and individualized therapies [ 140 141 142 12.4. Gut Microbiome as a Modulator of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Recent advances identify the gut microbiome as a promising therapeutic target to break the cycle of oxidative stress and inflammation in chronic and metabolic diseases. Dysbiosis is associated with the excessive production of pro-oxidant metabolites, weakened antioxidant defenses, and the release of microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharides, that activate the NF-κB and inflammasome pathways [ 143 144 145 47 146 147 148 149 Positioning the microbiome as a therapeutic target opens novel opportunities to complement existing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. By modulating host redox balance and immune signaling at their source, microbiome-directed interventions may offer a durable and systemic way to break the vicious cycle of oxidative stress and inflammation. 12.5. Synthetic Derivatives of Antioxidants: Advances and Therapeutic Potential Advancements in medicinal chemistry have led to the development of synthetic derivatives of natural antioxidants ( Figure 3 150 151 152 153 154 154 155 13. Conclusions This review has explored the complex link between oxidative stress and inflammation, highlighting their key roles in the development and progression of various chronic diseases. The evidence shows that oxidative stress not only causes cellular damage but also worsens inflammatory responses, sustaining pathological processes in conditions such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer. Natural and synthetic antioxidants are promising in reducing these harmful effects by neutralizing reactive oxygen species and affecting pro-inflammatory pathways. Importantly, combination therapies that include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents demonstrate synergistic effects, providing better results and fewer side effects than using single drugs. Recent advances in nanotechnology and targeted delivery systems have significantly improved the pharmacokinetics of these agents, enabling precise, site-specific treatments with minimal systemic side effects. The development of personalized medicine and the use of biomarkers have further enhanced therapeutic strategies, allowing for tailored treatments based on individual oxidative and inflammatory profiles. This move toward precision medicine offers great hope for improved clinical outcomes and a reduction in the burden of chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress.

This diagram illustrates the balance between external sources of oxidative stress, such as smoking, pollutants, radiation, diet, xenobiotics, and internal sources like chronic inflammation, along with the antioxidant defenses that mitigate their effects. Enzymatic systems, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and heme oxygenase-1, along with non-enzymatic molecules including glutathione, vitamins C and E, and polyphenols, neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protect macromolecules from damage. When ROS production exceeds antioxidant capacity, it results in oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA, which in turn increases inflammatory signaling, leading to further ROS production and creating a self-perpetuating cycle of oxidative stress and inflammation. Antioxidant defenses aim to break this cycle and prevent ROS-driven inflammation from escalating. If this balance is not restored, persistent oxidative stress and cellular damage occur, contributing to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders, chronic kidney disease, and cancer.
