Understanding the barriers along the PrEP continuum of care, known as the “PrEP cascade,” is crucial for effectively implementing PrEP interventions. Therefore, the objective of our study was twofold: first, to explore the stage of Latino SMM in the PrEP cascade by examining disparities in demographics, social factors, and healthcare aspects; second, to gain insights from healthcare providers who have direct clinical experience with our population regarding the challenges faced by Latino SMM in accessing and adhering to PrEP.
