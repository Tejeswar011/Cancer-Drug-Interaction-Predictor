Nicotine exposure assessment is an important consideration to determine the switching potential of NPs. These measurements are often conducted using randomized clinical studies. However, characterizing nicotine exposure under real‐world use conditions can further inform these assessments. We propose a framework based on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling that integrates typical use patterns and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data to predict nicotine exposure under actual use conditions. A tissue permeation model precedes the PBPK modeling and is characterized by two physiological parameters, nicotine diffusivity, and effective tissue thickness, which were determined and validated using literature data. A product‐specific tissue uptake fraction was determined by regression of nicotine pharmacokinetics measured under controlled use conditions and applied consistently for alternative use scenario analyses. Nicotine PK profiles were predicted under various use scenarios for cigarette smoking or MST use and compared to that from the use of two NPs, namely on! ® clinical pharmacology (CPH) drug abuse modeling and simulation PBPK pharmacoepidemiology (PHE) Altria Client Services, LLC pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025 [Correction added on June 27, 2025 after first online publication. The last sentence in Methods has been updated.] Introduction Smoking combustible cigarettes has been the leading cause of preventable mortality in the United States.  1  2  3  4  5  6  5  7  8  9  10 The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of the US Congress gave the regulatory oversight of tobacco products to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency).  11 max max max  12  13  14  15  16 Novel smoke‐free products, like nicotine pouches, offer a harm reduction opportunity for adults who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking. They will switch to such products if they get enough nicotine to satisfy their cravings for cigarettes. In this manuscript, we describe an approach that can simulate the nicotine exposure under actual use conditions, using a fit‐for‐purpose PBPK model. This approach can potentially minimize the need to conduct large clinical studies under multiple actual use behavior scenarios to characterize nicotine exposure from new tobacco products. We aim to demonstrate the applicability of a modeling framework for comparing nicotine exposure from different oral nicotine pouches through PBPK modeling. To this end, we couple a fit‐for‐purpose nicotine tissue permeation model in the buccal cavity (BC) with a previously published PBPK model.  17  18 ® Methods Human Buccal Tissue Permeation Model Nicotine release and uptake from NPs in the BC depends on a multitude of physiological factors, such as swallowing frequency and product manipulation, as well as physiochemical factors, such as product pH, formulation, and format. Nicotine undergoes extensive first‐pass metabolism in the liver once absorbed through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  19  20 Model Description The BC tissue permeation model employed here generalizes what was proposed by Rostami et al.  17 1 (1) ∂ C tiss ∂ t = ∂ ∂ x D ∂ C tiss ∂ x  C tiss ( x ) x t P app ≡ D K eff l  21  22 K eff  21  22 C tiss ( t , x = l ) = 0 While the oral product is in the BC until the end of the use time, t use (2) − DA ∂ C tiss ∂ x t ≤ t use , x = 0 = f tissue t × R rel t This equation is best suited for NP use where the nicotine release continues over the course of the product use.

In our model, we consider the pair (D, l) as solely BC tissue parameters, that is, independent of product type and formulation and are thus fixed once they have been optimized. We identified only two applicable datasets in the literature. The first data was for 2 g OBMST pinch weight (assuming ∼10 mg nicotine/g unused MST) use for 40 min  17  27  28  29  30  17 Supplementary Material ® ®  31  32 For all OBC smoking scenarios here, we assumed 90% of the inhaled dose was deposited in the upper respiratory tract, consistent with the PBPK model of Rostami et al.  17  33 S7 Nicotine PBPK Model Several human PBPK models have been proposed for nicotine  17  34  35  36  37  17  20  30  30  38  39 Kolli et al.  37  17  35 We utilize the nicotine PBPK model published by Rostami et al.  17 S1‐S3 The role of CYP2A6 genetic polymorphism on the hepatic metabolism of nicotine is well understood.  40  41  42  43  44 S8A‐C Development and simulation with the nicotine PBPK model were conducted using R software to translate and compile the model. Specifically, the model was written in MCSim,  45  46  17 Clinical Data All clinical PK profiles for two NP products, TP1 and TP2 were adapted from previous publications and scientific conference presentations.  29  33  47  48  49  33  48  29  33  33 S4  29  48  50 As observed from the dissolution testing  51  33  50 2 The average PK data collected for single use of TP1 for 30 min and TP2 for 45 min in clinical studies, referred to as base use cases hereafter, along with available nicotine release data, were used to regress against the tissue uptake fraction in Equation ( 2 AUS Data and Alternative Use Scenarios We utilized data from actual use study to obtain estimates of use behavior under naturalistic conditions. The FDA guidance states—“Evaluation of product use patterns should consider the topography of how individual users consume the product (e.g., the number of puffs, puff duration, puff intensity, duration of use), the frequency with which consumers use the product, and the trends by which users consume the product over time. If the product has not been previously marketed, such information could be collected from actual use studies.” Therefore, we had gathered product use behavior studies from an actual use study. The observations from actual use study of product use behavior under naturalistic conditions are intended to reflect a “real‐world” condition. We use the AUS data reported by Becker et al.,  49  52  49  52  53  54  55  53 Because the goal of this analysis was to predict nicotine exposure under typical use conditions, we simulated PK profiles as predicted under three different typical use scenarios, Table 1 Table 1 Number of NP product, OBMST product use, and OBC smoking sessions and use duration (minutes) per session in PBPK modeling of alternative use scenarios based on the AUS data Scenario I Scenario II Scenario III Product  Use occasions  Duration (min) Use occasions  Duration (min) Use occasions  Duration (min) TP1 1 15 1 25 6 15 TP2 1 15 1 30, 40 6 15 OBMST 1  a 45 1 75 5 45 OBC 1 5 1 5 15 5 a 2 and 4 g pinch weights on each use occasion.

Given that subjects in the study by Rensch et al.  33  60 2 We considered the 90% confidence intervals on inter‐individual variability in the extent of nicotine release (61% ± 7, SD ∼ 21%). We conducted a sensitivity analysis by simulating for the upper and lower bounds on the extent of nicotine release for 30 min use, see Figure S10 Scenario Analysis I We assigned a median time in mouth of 15 min for both TP1 and TP2 based on the AUS observations  49  52  54  55 3  48 max 3 Figure 3 Nicotine plasma concentration following the single use of (a) TP1 (2, 4, and 8 mg) for 15 min and (b) TP2 (6, 9, and 12 mg) for 15 min, (c) subject's OBMST for 45 min and (d) smoking a single OBC (10 puffs equally spaced over 5 min).

PBPK predictions are represented by the solid curves while symbols represent the average baseline adjusted clinical PK profiles from literature up to the point they are applicable in use Scenario II.  29  33  47  48 Scenario Analysis III In this scenario, we predicted the nicotine PK profiles over the day, assuming that multiple use occasions are spread evenly across 16 h waking period. Figure 5 Figure 5 Nicotine plasma concentration (a) and cumulative AUC (b) following the multiple uses of TP1 (2, 4, and 8 mg) for 15 min at a time in Scenario III. Venous nicotine plasma concentration (c) and cumulative AUC (d) following the multiple uses of TP2 (6, 9, and 12 mg) for 15 min at a time in Scenario III. Corresponding venous nicotine plasma and AUC for subject's OBMST for 45 min and smoking OBC (2 mg Nic/Cig, ten puffs equally spaced over 5 min) in Scenario III are also overlayed in the plots for TP1 and TP2. For all nicotine levels of either NPs studied here in scenario III, the maximum steady state nicotine plasma concentration as well as AUC at any given time are either below or similar to that predicted for OBMST product use and OBC smoking. The predicted plasma concentrations for TP1 are consistently below OBC and similar when considering 2 g pinch size for OBMST, but lower for the 4 g pinch size for OBMST. Discussion A validated, fit‐for‐purpose PBPK model can be useful for predicting nicotine plasma pharmacokinetics of nicotine pouches under naturalistic use conditions to assess switching potential from cigarettes. We utilized this validated PBPK model to first predict the nicotine PK for OBC and OBMST.

Due to the differences in use frequency, the concentration peaks corresponding to the start of each product use occasion in this multi‐use scenario do not coincide in Figure 5  48  10 Our findings should be considered in the context of assumptions and limitations typical of any model‐based predictions. We have identified many of the assumptions in the manuscript; here, we list some of the limitations. We did not consider the variability that is typically observed in use patterns between individuals. However, we accounted for some of these differences by including extreme use patterns. Another limitation of the PBPK model is that we assumed other tissue uptake parameters as constant and followed first‐order processes. There is no evidence in the literature of non‐linear pharmacokinetics with an increase in the dose of nicotine. Furthermore, the reliability of our findings is likely limited to TP1 and TP2, and we caution against extrapolations to other nicotine pouches. The current PBPK model is developed to integrate the overall average parameters in use pattern, nicotine release, BC tissue uptake, and physiological parameters. Nonetheless, the proposed modeling here can further inform nicotine exposure under actual use conditions. PBPK modeling can be a fit‐for‐purpose tool for predicting nicotine exposure under various use scenarios. Conclusions We present the application of a validated PBPK model to predict nicotine PK for nicotine pouches under naturalistic use conditions to inform the switching potential from cigarettes. In this model, we integrate nicotine PK data for the nicotine pouches from a randomized controlled clinical study with naturistic use patterns observed in an actual use study to predict nicotine exposure under various naturalistic use conditions. The PBPK model is unique because it utilizes a buccal tissue permeation model tracking the release and uptake of nicotine that explicitly accounts for partitioning between the buccal cavity and the GI tract. This model allows prediction of nicotine PK under different naturalistic conditions that are impractical to assess under clinical studies.
