All rights reserved. 2025 Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States, and its impact on both patients and their caregivers, particularly in advanced or metastatic disease, is substantial. Additionally, for the most common breast cancer subtype (estrogen receptor [ER]+/human endothelial growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]−), the treatment landscape for metastatic disease is continuously evolving, making appropriate therapy sequencing challenging. To discuss navigating the rapidly changing landscape of ER+/HER2− metastatic breast cancer (mBC), AMCP Market Insights virtually convened an expert panel of managed care stakeholders in February 2025. Key insights from the discussion on ER+/HER2− mBC included addressing the patient care journey, maintaining high-quality care, managing the impact to payers, evaluating new and emerging therapies, and looking toward the future. Suggested payer best practices in ER+/HER2− mBC also emerged from the discussion. Plain language summary Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States, and its impact on both patients and their caregivers, particularly in advanced disease, is substantial. The treatment and care of the most common subtype of breast cancer is rapidly changing, which can be challenging for health care organizations. However, these organizations need to stay current on updates in breast cancer to better support patients and caregivers. Implications for managed care pharmacy Remaining current on the treatment landscape for the most common breast cancer subtype, estrogen receptor +/human endothelial growth factor receptor 2 −, especially for metastatic disease is challenging for managed care organizations. This article provides key insights and suggested payer best practices from an expert managed care panel discussion on navigating this rapidly changing space. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
