MALDI imaging is particularly well-suited for the spatially resolved detection of drug metabolites, which inherently exhibit different molecular weights, thereby providing a detailed molecular profile 18 19 21 20 21 The goal of this study was to develop a robust QMALDI imaging technique to investigate the distribution of aspirin metabolites, particularly SA as an activatable CEST MRI contrast agent 9 Methods Materials. 6 6 Animal Study and Tissue Collection.

Integrative Data Analysis Approach using the Weave Software. For preprocessing, raw MALDI imaging data were converted to imzML format for further processing. The imaging data underwent preprocessing with total ion current (TIC) normalization to standardize signal intensities across all spectra. We selected peaks corresponding to SA, defined by their respective m/z m/z For integrating microscopic imaging modalities, H-E, MALDI, and IF images were manually co-registered using non-rigid registration 23 After aligning the MALDI ion and IF images, IF image pixels (0.325 µm/pixel) were down sampled to the resolution of the MALDI ion image pixel masks (20 µm/pixel) for the calculation of mean IF intensity values per MALDI ion image pixel. This approach allowed us to perform quantitative comparisons of MALDI ion image signals in regions with varying levels of fluorescence staining intensity. The resulting integrated dataset, comprising MALDI ion image intensities and mean IF intensities for each MALDI ion image pixel, enabled further analysis and extraction of MALDI ion image signal intensities based on fluorescence intensity thresholds in the CD31 stained IF image. Finally, the fused H-E, MALDI-MSI, and IF imaging data stacks were visualized using reports generated in the Weave Platform. For tumor and kidney tissues, H-E-stained images with annotated regions were co-registered with MALDI images of SA using SCiLS Lab software. The normalized SA intensity was calculated for each defined region from these co-registered images. This assessment was conducted by measuring the SA intensity per pixel across all samples, and data visualization with violin plots was accomplished in R (version 4.4.3) using multiple graphical packages including lattice, plot3D, vioplot, and RColorBrewer. The comparative analysis was presented as an enhanced 3D violin plot incorporating multiple layers of visual information. Statistical Analysis. Results and Discussion Peracetic Acid as Spray Additive for MALDI Tissue Imaging of Aspirin Metabolites When optimizing MALDI matrices for qualitative and quantitative MALDI imaging, the interference caused by noise signals originating from matrix, metals, and other impurities in the tissue sample during the MALDI desorption and ionization process poses a challenge 24 m/z 21 m/z 9 3 3 3 • 2 • 25 26 27 To investigate changes in SA intensity in MALDI imaging, 1 mM SA was applied as dried droplets on tissue sections from control mice (not treated with aspirin) prior to spraying the tissues with nH matrix. Then, nH matrix was sprayed onto these tissue sections with varying concentrations of PAA (0, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) as an additive. An increase in SA intensity was observed when adding 1 mM PAA as compared to control (0 mM PAA) (Figure 1 1 m/z Figure S1 There were additional benefits as well. At a concentration of 5 mM PAA, the PAA and nH matrix demonstrated a more uniform distribution of co-crystals, as observed in polarization images taken at 40× magnification, compared to samples sprayed with other PAA concentrations (Figures 1 1 20 20 28 29 20 30 1 30 31 The addition of 5 mM PAA in the spray enhanced the signal intensity of SA in the tissues of SUM159 tumors, livers, and kidneys of aspirin-treated mice without causing SA delocalization, while reducing noise signals from the matrix both on and off tissue ( Figures S2 m/z m/z m/z m/z Figures S5 m/z m/z 32 Figure S7 m/z Figure S7 m/z Figure S7 Figure S7 Overall, the addition of 5 mM PAA significantly enhanced the SA peak intensity across all tested tissues. Compared to controls without PAA, we observed fold increases of 3.2 in liver, 1.8 in kidney, and 1.7 in SUM159 tumor tissues, resulting in a significant improvement in MALDI imaging of SA. The PAA spray additive for nH matrix deposition also improved matrix uniformity and led to a reduction in matrix crystal size, likely due to hydrogen bonding between PAA and nH matrix. However, when the concentration of PAA was increased to greater than 10 mM, both the matrix and dried SA droplets on the tissue underwent degradation, resulting in a decrease in SA intensity (Figure 1 1 20 30 31 PAA-Assisted MALDI Imaging of the Distribution of Aspirin Metabolites in Various Tissues Sections Next, we used this new approach to study the aspirin and SA distributions within various tissues. The structures and masses of aspirin, SA, and several other aspirin metabolites are shown in Figure 2 3 m/z m/z Figure S13 m/z m/z Figures S8 m/z m/z m/z Figures S9 m/z m/z m/z Figures S10 QMALDI Imaging of SA in Tissue Sections with PAA Spray Additive and Deuterated Internal Standard We further developed QMALDI imaging of SA by using PAA-assisted spraying of nH matrix and deuterated SA (D 6 20 33 20 33 34 33 Following this quantification approach ( Figure S16 4 4 6 6 4 6 6 6 35 36 6 4 6 SA concentrations were quantitatively measured in liver, kidney, and SUM159 TNBC tumor tissues using three technical replicates per tissue type, where QMALDI imaging measurements were averaged from three directly adjacent tissues to enhance accuracy. The resulting SA tissue concentrations were 141.9 ± 22.6 pmol/mm² in the liver, 129.5 ± 7.8 pmol/mm² in the kidney, and 50.4 ± 3.0 pmol/mm² in the SUM159 TNBC tumor for three technical replicates per tissue type (Table 2 6 2 Aspirin is known to rapidly hydrolyze into salicylic acid (SA) once it enters the body 37 38 37 2 Integrated Spatial Analysis of QMALDI SA Imaging with H-E Staining of Tissue Architecture and CD31 Immunofluorescence Staining of Vasculature We were also interested in the biodistribution of SA with respect to tissue architecture and vasculature. To this extend, we performed H-E staining to evaluate anatomical tissue structures and CD31 IF staining to visualize vascular networks. We fused these imaging datasets, i.e., H-E, DAPI and CD31 IF, and MALDI imaging, as illustrated in Figure 5 6 versus 6 6 We next evaluated the spatial distribution of SA abundance within kidney tissues and analyzed the fused data of MALDI imaging combined with H-E staining (Figure 7 7 These QMALDI imaging findings are in good agreement with our previous CEST MRI study 9 6 7 9 4 9 Conclusions We established a robust quantitative approach for targeted QMALDI imaging of SA by using nH matrix with 5 mM PAA as an additive and D 6 39 20 This new QMALDI imaging technique was applied to quantitatively measuring SA in liver, kidney, and SUM159 TNBC tumor tissues in mice at 60 minutes following intravenous injection of aspirin. QMALDI imaging was able to quantify SA tissue concentrations of 133.0 ± 44.6 pmol/mm² in the liver, 140.3 ± 23.3 pmol/mm² in the kidney, and 34.5 ± 10.8 pmol/mm² in the SUM159 TNBC tumor from three biological replicates each. High consistency observed between technical and biological replicates in this study reinforces the reliability of the newly developed QMALDI imaging technique for detecting the spatial distribution and absolute quantitation of SA in tissue sections. Furthermore, we observed high SA in the kidney medulla and the CD31-positive, highly vascularized and viable regions in the tumor rim. This was possible by co-registration, scaling, and pixel matching of the MALDI imaging data with H-E stained, and CD31 and DAPI IF stained slide-scanned images of the same and adjacent tissue sections. These findings match our earlier findings with SA CEST MRI 9 Supplementary Material Supplementary figures.
