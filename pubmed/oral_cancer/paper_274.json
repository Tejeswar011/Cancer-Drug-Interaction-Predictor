Background/purpose Teledentistry has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional care. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of teledentistry in diagnosing and managing oral soft tissue diseases compared to traditional consultations, explores clinical outcomes, technological challenges, and implications for future research and policy, and digitally advanced countries. Materials and methods A review registered in Prospero with CRD42024626432 used CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect databases following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Eligibility was based on population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design (PICOS) with inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on rural populations, teledentistry interventions for oral soft tissue conditions, comparative models, and clinical outcomes. Bias risk was assessed using the Risk of Bias Tool for Nonrandomized Studies. Results Fourteen eligible studies were included. Most demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy of oral soft tissue lesions, patient satisfaction, and follow-up compliance in teledentistry-supported care. Modern platform diagnostics were commonly used. The comparative analyses showed that teledentistry was at least equivalent to traditional consultations. Conclusion Teledentistry shows strong potential as a cost-effective, accessible solution for managing oral soft tissue conditions. Its integration into mainstream healthcare could bridge disparities in oral health service delivery in underserved regions.

Focusing on studies in post-COVID-19 settings, it identifies clinical benefits, technological limitations, and patient outcomes. The goal is to provide an evidence-based foundation for future research, optimize digital oral healthcare strategies, and support policies for equitable access to services through teledentistry, particularly for advanced tech countries like Taiwan. Material and methods Search strategy and eligibility criteria This systematic review follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. 25 , 26 This study was conducted on November 11th, 2024, utilizing several electronic databases, including CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect. The search terms used in each database were in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” were utilized for search items shown in Table 1 Table 1 Database search strategy. Table 1 Databases Keywords Results CINAHL (((teledentistry) OR (remote consultation) OR (telemedicine)) AND ((oral soft tissue) OR (mouth mucosa))) 236 Embase (((teledentistry) OR (teleconsultation) OR (telemedicine)) AND ((oral AND soft AND tissue) OR (mouth AND mucosa))) 56 Science direct (((teledentistry) OR (remote consultation) OR (telemedicine)) AND ((oral soft tissue) OR (mouth mucosa))) 92 Proquest (((teledentistry) OR (remote consultation) OR (telemedicine)) AND ((oral soft tissue) OR (mouth mucosa))) 317 Study selection The study selection process was conducted by two independent reviewers, Israyani (I) and Christine Anastasia Rovani (C.A.R.), in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. After removing duplicate entries using Rayyan (new.Rayyan.ai), both reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts in a blinded manner. Any disagreements between the reviewers during screening or full-text eligibility assessment were resolved through discussion. If consensus could not be reached, a third reviewer, Chung-Ming Liu (C-M.L.), served as the adjudicator to make the final decision. This dual-reviewer process ensured methodological rigor and minimized the risk of selection bias. Eligible studies focused on populations with limited access to oral care, specifically those with oral soft tissue diseases. Interventions included modern teledentistry applications. Comparative studies assessing teledentistry against conventional care. Outcomes of interest spanned early diagnosis of oral soft tissue lesions for patients during teledentistry. Study designs featured cohort studies, longitudinal research, and qualitative or mixed-method studies on implementation barriers. Studies involving only urban or rural populations, outdated technology, non-comparative analyses, irrelevant outcomes, theoretical papers, case reports, and those lacking methodological rigor were excluded. Data collection and harmonization Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers (I. and C.A.R.) using a standardized data extraction form. Data included publication characteristics, population demographics, types of oral lesions, teledentistry platforms used, diagnostic approaches, and outcome measures. In cases of discrepancies between the two reviewers, consensus was sought through discussion. If consensus could not be achieved, the third reviewer (C-M.L.) was consulted to resolve the disagreement. This dual data extraction approach further enhanced the validity and reliability of the review findings. The extracted data included paper titles, authors, publication years, research locations, and study details population, including age and gender, software used, type of device used, study design, comparative method, intervention, outcome measured, and diagnosis of oral disease were established. Risk of bias and quality evaluations In this study, authors I. and C.A.R. evaluated bias risk and quality using the risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions version 2 (ROBINS-I V2) tool. 27 , 28 Due to the significant heterogeneity in study designs, intervention types, diagnostic modalities, and outcome measures, a quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible. Therefore, we employed a structured narrative synthesis approach in accordance with the SWiM (Synthesis Without Meta-analysis) reporting guidelines. This method enabled us to summarize and compare findings across diverse contexts while maintaining methodological transparency.

Table 3 First author Software used Methods Result summary Ref Ako et al. SPSS-28 Cross-sectional study on 60 elderly in long-term care. OHAT is used for in-person (OHAT-B) and video (OHAT–V1–V3) assessments. Intraoral videos were recorded via an iPhone 14. Three dentists performed video evaluations. Reliability was analyzed using SPSS. The study found that oral health assessments using video recordings of the oral cavity taken with a mobile electronic device showed high reliability and substantial agreement with in-person assessments, suggesting the possibility of remote oral health assessment for older adults in long-term care facilities. 29 Vetchaporn et al. Inskam, line application A diagnostic device combining autofluorescence and white light was developed and tested on 34 OPMD patients. Validated via clinical and histopathological comparison. Images from 17 intraoral sites were captured and sent through a smartphone app for remote diagnosis. Compared the combination method vs. autofluorescence alone. The intraoral camera with fluorescent aids, combined with autofluorescence and LED white light, demonstrated high validity and reliability for screening oral potentially malignant disorders in teledentistry, with improved sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV compared to autofluorescence alone. 30 Sidabutar et al. drgbeta.com Cross-sectional study using researcher-developed teledentistry app ( drgbeta.com The drgbeta.com 31 Barca et al. Graphpad Conducted at the maxillofacial surgery unit, “magna graecia” university. Two groups: Follow-up and urgent cases. Video consultations via smartphone. Data: Demographics, photos, consultation times, feedback. COVID-19 screening and satisfaction surveys included. Analyzed with GraphPad. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of telemedicine in managing maxillofacial surgical pathologies during the COVID-19 pandemic, with high satisfaction rates among patients and doctors, and successful remote consultations and biopsies for 90 patients. 32 Fonseca et al. Google docs, dropbox Oral lesion images captured using an 8-megapixel smartphone with flash; no editing applied. Encrypted images were analyzed remotely by three experienced evaluators. Diagnostic input and feedback were collected via google docs. Telediagnosis of oral lesions using smartphone photography showed high diagnostic accuracy, with at least one evaluator correct in 97 % of cases, comparable to face-to-face diagnosis. 33 Steinmeier et al. 3shape communicate, version 4.0.1; microsoft excel; r; ggplot2 Cross-sectional validation study with 10 patients. IOS (Trios), full-mouth exams, and radiographs obtained. Ten dentists performed remote and radiograph-assisted assessments. The agreement was analyzed descriptively (100 observations/parameter) using Excel and R studio. The study found that intraoral scans (IOS) were effective for detecting dental findings but less accurate for assessing periodontal conditions, with agreement between remote and clinical diagnoses ranging from 78 % to 95 % for dental conditions and moderate sensitivity and specificity for gingivitis and periodontitis. 34 Meisha et al. IBM SPSS-24 Cross-sectional web-based survey (apr–Jun 2020) in Saudi Arabia; adults ≥18 years, excluding dental workers. Snowball sampling; data via anonymous QuestionPro survey. Topics: Emergency, urgent, routine dental care. Logistic regression used; analysis in SPSS. The study found that during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia, participants were more willing to seek emergency dental care for life-threatening conditions but less so for conditions like facial cellulitis, with a preference for teleconsultation and significant social disparities in healthcare-seeking behavior. 35 Bhushan et al. Not mentioned Review of telemedicine regulations and protocols per government, NITI aayog, and board of governors guidelines. “Type seven Elements for telemedicine consultation” and COVID-19 procedural recommendations from the government and the DCI are included. Telemedicine is a valuable tool in managing facio-odontogenic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing interpersonal interactions for pre- and post-operative visits. 36 Paixão et al. SPSS-22 Secondary data from asynchronous teleconsulting (minas gerais, Jul 2015–Jul 2017) was analyzed for dental specialty and question type. A third reviewer resolves disagreements. Questions are classified as diagnostic or general. Descriptive analysis using SPSS v22.0. The study found that most teleconsulting sessions in oral medicine focused on diagnosing conditions like infections and biopsies, while pharmacology questions centered on general approaches such as prescriptions and anesthetics, highlighting a need for more academic training in these areas. 37 Ali et al. SPSS-22 Retrospective analysis of audio-only teledentistry triage (mar–Aug 2020); compared remote vs. in-person diagnoses using Cohen's weighted kappa. Data collected via a standardized form. Photo senders excluded. Statistical analysis performed with SPSS. The study found a significantly excellent pair-wise agreement between synchronous audioconferencing teledentistry and clinical face-to-face diagnoses, with kappa values indicating high reliability. However, conditions like pulpitis and periodontitis showed slightly lower agreement levels. 38 Rabinovici-coh et al. Fusemedml, scikit-learn, pytorch, pytorch lightning Retrospective study of 1470 patients using smartphone clinical images. Deep learning models (CNN-ResNet18, OCNN-ResNet50) were trained for OSCC and suspicious lesion detection. Dataset from TZMC and online sources. Metadata fusion, pretrained weights, and ensemble methods applied. Data stratified by lesion location. The study demonstrates the efficacy of deep learning methods in predicting OSCC and suspicious cases, achieving high accuracy with AUC values of 0.96 for OSCC prediction and enhanced accuracy for specific lesion locations. 39 Lin et al. Not mentioned Developed recommendations for capturing interpretable intraoral photographs, emphasizing ideal lighting, mirror positioning, camera angle, and tissue retraction. Utilized simple tools such as smartphone cameras and cheek retractors. Provided guidelines applicable to clinical and home settings, enabling patients to take self-photographs for follow-up under adequate lighting conditions. Specific intraoral site instructions were detailed in tables for standardized photo capture. The paper proposes recommendations for intraoral photography in oral mucosal screening, adaptable to smartphone or point-and-shoot cameras, to standardize image quality and facilitate remote triage and follow-up of oral lesions, improving clinical care and knowledge sharing. 40 Dornellas et al. Medcalc, jamovi, rstudio This before-and-after study in a randomized clinical trial validates the QuesT-Odontoped questionnaire for teletriage. 260 children were randomized into G1 (teleconsultation) and G2 (teleconsultation plus face-to-face consultation). Pain and quality-of-life scales were assessed at 7, 14, 12, and 24 months. Statistical analyses included mann–Whitney, Student's t-test, and Poisson regression. Teletriage was conducted via the NuTes-FOUSP platform. Ethical approval and data protection protocols were followed.

Figure 2 Discussion This systematic review comprehensively evaluates the current landscape of teledentistry and remote oral health assessments, emphasizing methodological heterogeneity and a wide range of clinical applications. A total of 14 eligible studies were included, encompassing various study designs and geographic locations, which underscore teledentistry's global relevance and adaptability. Our analysis of eligible studies indicates that teledentistry can reliably identify oral mucosal lesions, including potentially malignant disorders, using remote imaging and teleconsultation platforms. 43 44 45 The findings indicate that digital tools, such as video-based assessments, intraoral imaging technologies, and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnostics, consistently demonstrate high reliability in detecting oral pathologies. For instance, Ako et al. confirmed the feasibility of mobile-based assessments in geriatric care settings. 29 30 33 32 , 39 31 , 42 Notably, the integration of teledentistry was most effective in healthcare systems with adequately established digital infrastructure and professional training. 21 46 , 47 47 , 48 49 , 50 Patient satisfaction and acceptance emerged as pivotal components of successful teledentistry services. Several studies in the review reported high satisfaction rates among patients using teledentistry for oral soft tissue consultations, especially when it reduced travel time, cost, and waiting periods. 51 52 53 54 , 55 Although several studies implied that teledentistry may reduce the cost burden by minimizing the need for in-person consultations, travel expenses, and time off work, particularly for rural and elderly populations, few of the included studies conducted formal cost-effectiveness analyses. For example, Sidabutar et al. noted improved access among low-income groups using a custom teledentistry platform, yet no direct economic evaluation was reported. 31 32 , 42 From a clinical perspective, the reviewed studies suggest that teledentistry enhances the management of oral soft tissue lesions through rapid triage, appropriate referrals, and collaborative care among dental specialists. Several models demonstrated that teledentistry could be effectively integrated into oral healthcare frameworks, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and reducing the burden on tertiary care centers. 20 , 56 56 , 57 However, limitations such as inconsistent image quality, restricted internet bandwidth in rural regions, and the predominance of cross-sectional designs constrain these digital solutions' broader implementation and long-term validation. Future studies should prioritize multi-center randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with standardized protocols to advance the field, to strengthen methodological rigor, and improve generalizability across diverse populations. Furthermore, comprehensive cost-effectiveness analyses are warranted to evaluate teledentistry systems' economic viability and scalability in routine clinical practice. Addressing these gaps will be instrumental in refining the integration of teledentistry into contemporary dental healthcare delivery. While this review synthesized evidence across 14 studies, no meta-analysis was conducted. This decision was driven by the high degree of clinical and methodological heterogeneity among the included studies ranging from different diagnostic technologies and oral lesion types to variability in study designs and patient populations. Although the lack of meta-analysis limits the statistical strength of the conclusions, the structured narrative approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of key themes, diagnostic performance, and contextual implementation factors. This review highlights teledentistry's transformative role in oral health care, especially in enhancing diagnostics and access for underserved populations. Advanced technologies like mobile imaging and artificial intelligence show promising diagnostic reliability. However, study quality and design heterogeneity challenge definitive conclusions. Future large-scale studies are essential to validate these findings, inform clinical guidelines, and ensure teledentistry's sustainable implementation in various healthcare settings. Future research should prioritize comprehensive economic evaluations and cost-effectiveness analyses of teledentistry platforms, particularly in diverse healthcare settings, to substantiate its financial sustainability and inform policymaking.
