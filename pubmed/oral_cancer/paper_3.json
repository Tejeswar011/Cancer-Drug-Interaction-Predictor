Herein, we report a case of a 44-year-old woman who presented with fever and a productive cough. Chest computed tomography revealed a giant cystic lesion in the left upper lobe with an air-fluid level, suggesting superimposed infection. Despite intravenous antibiotics, the lesion rapidly progressed, leading to pulmonary abscess formation. A lobectomy was performed due to poor response to medical therapy and risk of sepsis. Pathology confirmed a giant pulmonary cyst with secondary abscess. This case illustrates the rare but serious complication of cyst infection leading to lobectomy and emphasizes the importance of early intervention and surgical consideration. lobectomy lung abscess pulmonary cyst streptococcus anginosus thoracic surgery pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Pulmonary cysts are air- or fluid-filled parenchymal spaces surrounded by an epithelial or fibrous wall. They may be congenital (e.g., congenital pulmonary airway malformation, or CPAM), acquired (e.g., emphysematous bullae), infectious (e.g., post-tuberculosis or parasitic), or neoplastic. Most pulmonary cysts remain stable and asymptomatic; however, recognized complications include rupture, pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and secondary infection, while progression to abscess is uncommon in immunocompetent patients [ 1 2 Diagnosing an infected cyst may be challenging due to its overlap with necrotizing pneumonia, cavitary neoplasms, or parasitic etiologies such as echinococcosis [ 3 5 Case presentation A 44-year-old woman with no significant medical or travel history presented with a five-day history of productive cough and low-grade fever. She denied dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pain, or weight loss. Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds over the left upper chest. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (13,200/μL), elevated C-reactive protein level (13.6 mg/dL), and normal liver and renal function. Her initial chest radiograph (day 0) was inconclusive. Contrast-enhanced chest CT revealed a well-defined, 9-cm air-filled cyst in the right upper lobe apicoposterior segment, without consolidation or fluid (Figure 1 Figure 1 Coronal CT on initial presentation An air-filled cyst (9 cm) is seen in the apicoposterior segment of the right upper lobe with no fluid or consolidation. Empirical intravenous meropenem was initiated at 1 g every eight hours (approx. 48 mg/kg/day) based on body weight (60 kg). Bronchoscopy was deferred due to the risk of cyst rupture and stable oxygenation. Despite antibiotics, the patient remained febrile. On day 6, chest X-ray revealed a new air-fluid level (Figure 2 3 Figure 2 Chest CT at the time of clinical deterioration Development of an air-fluid level within the right upper lobe cyst, suggesting abscess formation. Figure 3 Axial CT showing progression to abscess A thick-walled cavity with pericystic infiltration and fluid level in the right upper lobe is seen, consistent with an abscess. Video-assisted thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy was performed on day 7. Intraoperatively, the cyst contained 150 mL of purulent fluid. Histology confirmed a benign epithelial-lined cyst with neutrophilic infiltration. No neoplasia or parasitic structures were seen, and culture revealed Streptococcus anginosus The postoperative course was uneventful, with inflammatory markers normalizing (WBC 6,100/μL; CRP 0.5 mg/dL) by day 7 postoperatively. A follow-up chest radiograph was clear. The patient was discharged on day 9 on a seven-day course of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (1,000 mg/62.5 mg twice daily). No recurrence was observed at the two-month follow-up. Discussion Giant pulmonary cysts (>5 cm) are rare and typically asymptomatic. Complications such as rupture into the pleural space leading to pneumothorax, hemoptysis, secondary infection, and, in rare instances, malignant transformation have been reported [ 1 6 7 Streptococcus anginosus S. milleri 8 6 Conclusions This case illustrates the rare transformation of a pulmonary cyst into a lung abscess, requiring lobectomy despite antibiotic treatment. In such cases, early recognition, monitoring via imaging, and prompt surgical referral are essential to avoid complications. Thoracic surgeons should maintain a broad differential, including hydatid disease, and consider bronchoscopy selectively.
