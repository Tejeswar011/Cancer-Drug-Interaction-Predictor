Investigating the role of integrins in controlling melanoma behavior can help identify new approaches to precisely target tumor cells. This review highlights recent advances in translational research between 2021 and 2025, focusing on potential melanoma therapies based on integrin signaling. These developments may pave the way for more selective and efficient treatment of melanoma patients. Abstract Extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules play a vital role in the regulation of cellular phenotype. Ongoing interactions of the extracellular matrix and cells via surface receptors can affect the cellular behavior selectively or non-selectively. Under physiological conditions, the ECM-cell interactions are essential for ensuring balance, whereas the dysregulation of these interactions can lead to the onset of diseases. Extensive knowledge of the integrins with two non-covalently linked α and β subunits plays a vital role in cell–cell adhesion and ECM interactions. The identification of a key adhesion signaling pathway may lead to new therapeutic strategies targeting melanoma cells. This review highlights the potential role of integrins as a selective target in melanoma therapy, which would reduce side effects and increase the effects of the treatment. cancer melanoma integrins adhesion molecules extracellular matrix DOD #W81XWH2210689 Medical University of Gdansk St-54 This research received no external funding.

Introduction Melanoma, an aggressive skin tumor of melanocytic origin, significantly challenges public health due to its aggressive behavior, resistance to therapy of advanced disease, and complex biology [ 1 The global incidence of melanoma continues to rise. Data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, spanning over 50 years, demonstrate evolving patterns in the rates of primary cutaneous melanoma [ 1 2 3 4 1 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1 7 15 The rapid progression of melanoma and metastases to lymph nodes and distant organs, such as lungs [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 10 24 25 Despite recent progress, melanoma treatment, especially for advanced and metastatic forms, remains challenging. A major challenge is disease heterogeneity, where different melanoma cells react distinctly to therapies, often leading to drug resistance. These can be secondary to pathological and uncontrolled melanogenesis, generating an immunosuppressive and mutagenic environment within the tumor [ 10 24 26 27 28 29 30 Figure 1 1 Figure 1 Emerging Therapeutic Approaches to Melanoma. Created with BioRender.com. 2. Integrin–Extracellular Matrix Interactions 2.1. The Role of Integrins Integrins are a key family of cell surface receptors that mediate critical interactions between cells and their extracellular environment. Their unique biology is fundamental to various physiological and pathological processes, including oncogenesis and tumor progression, especially in melanoma [ 31 Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins, composed of one α (alpha) subunit and one β (beta) subunit. The human body has 18 different α and 8 β subunits. Their combinations allow the formation of 24 unique combinations of proteins, each exhibiting unique binding specificities and functional roles. These receptors link the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the actin cytoskeleton inside the cell, providing a mechanical bridge that allows cells to sense and respond to their physical surroundings [ 32 33 Integrins play a key role in cell adhesion, enabling stable yet dynamic adhesion connecting cells to ECM components. The adhesion is not static but dynamic, allowing cells to engage and disengage as needed for processes like migration. Beyond mechanical roles, integrins are powerful signaling agents. They mediate important signaling pathways that control various cellular functions, including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation [ 34 35 2.2. Extracellular Matrix Remodeling in Melanoma In melanoma, the expression and function of integrins are significantly altered compared to normal melanocytes, playing a crucial role in tumor progression and metastasis [ 36 37 38 39 40 Figure 2  Figure 2 Cell–ECM interactions and downstream signaling pathways. The extracellular matrix (ECM) also contains hydrated, gel-forming macromolecules such as hyaluronan and proteoglycans alongside integrins that transmit adhesion signals, and various other components [ 41 42 43 44 2.3. Role in Tumor Progression and Metastasis The “inside-out” signaling happens when a signal from inside the cell activates the integrin, even without an external ligand attaching. The “outside-in” signaling happens when a ligand attaches to the integrin from outside the cell. This causes the integrin to change shape, increasing its ability to bind to the ligand and leading to integrin clustering, which initiates cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix [ 45 46 47 Integrins are key players in melanoma tumor progression and metastasis due to their modified expression in tumor cells. They also play a major role in the metastasis cascade, affecting fundamental processes such as cell adhesion, signaling, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) [ 48 49 2.4. Integrins and Therapy Resistance Integrin-ECM signaling plays a pivotal role in therapeutic resistance, enabling tumor cells to survive under the pressure of treatment. In melanoma with BRAF mutations, resistance to targeted therapy, including dual treatment with MAPK and PI3K/AKT inhibitors, is a common challenge despite early efficacy [ 50 Studies have shown that this resistance is mediated by ECM integrins α3β1 and α11β1. Once connected to the ECM, integrins activate Src kinase, a main mechanism driving resistance. The blockage of α3β1 and α11β1 integrins significantly inhibits the proliferation of resistant melanoma cells [ 51 52 53 By examining their role in tumor growth, spread, and resistance to therapy, this research aims to understand how targeting integrin–extracellular matrix signaling can lead to new treatments. 3. Current Translational Research on Integrin Signaling in Melanoma Treatment Integrins as transmembrane receptors play an essential role in cell migration, adhesion, and signaling in cancer growth [ 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 Translational research in the years 2021–2025 led to the potential integrin-targeted treatments and biomarkers [ 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 Table 1 Table 2 Table 3  cancers-17-03037-t001_Table 1 Table 1 In vitro studies on integrin signaling in melanoma treatment (2021–2025).

Peptide–Toxin Conjugates for Tumor-Selective Cytotoxicity via Integrin α6 A notable advancement in targeted melanoma therapy involves the development of the multifunctional peptide 4S5NG, which integrates an α6-specific ligand (S5), an intracellular delivery sequence (N), and an endosomal escape domain (G). When conjugated to a de-immunized Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE24), construct—4S5NG–PE24—exhibits highly selective uptake in integrin α6 + In vivo studies confirm both selective tumor accumulation and limited off-target toxicity. Importantly, co-treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti–PD-1) leads to a synergistic anti-tumor response, supporting the dual functionality of this system in direct cytotoxicity and immune activation. This strategy establishes a promising blueprint for next-generation peptide-based therapeutics in precision oncology [ 49 3.2. Extracellular Vesicle-Mediated Nanotherapies Targeting Integrin αvβ3 and αvβ5 Integrin-targeted extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a versatile platform for drug delivery and intercellular communication in melanoma. EVs functionalized with the cyclic RGD peptide (cRGD) enable selective binding to αvβ3-expressing melanoma cells, while a pH-sensitive polymer (DEAP-DOCA) facilitates controlled drug release (e.g., 5-fluorouracil) in the acidic tumor microenvironment. This design enhances therapeutic selectivity and efficacy in vivo [ 96 Parallel studies show that melanoma-derived ectosomes enriched with αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins can transfer these proteins to endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis through integrin-specific pathways. Notably, αvβ5 plays a dominant role via VEGF signaling, highlighting it as a priority target for anti-angiogenic interventions [ 82 3.3. Intracellular Regulators of Integrin Expression and Chemotherapy Sensitization Beyond extracellular targeting, emerging studies emphasize the importance of regulatory pathways modulating integrin expression and function. The SERPINB8–furin–ITGAX axis, for example, influences integrin αXβ2 expression, which contributes to melanoma cell proliferation. Targeting this axis disrupts integrin-mediated growth signals [ 84 Similarly, the talin2–KANK2 module plays a pivotal role in regulating microtubule dynamics and paclitaxel sensitivity in integrin αvβ5-positive melanoma cells. Talin2 knockdown destabilizes focal adhesions and enhances chemotherapeutic response, suggesting that structural integrin interactors represent viable co-targets to improve drug efficacy [ 85 Inhibition of integrin-linked kinase (ILK)—a central node in integrin signaling—combined with chloroquine, further demonstrates that translation and autophagy regulation intersect with integrin-mediated survival pathways. These regulatory insights open new ways for rational combination therapies targeting both adhesion and signaling nodes [ 91 3.4. Integrin-Mediated Control of Angiogenesis and Metastasis Integrins also play critical roles in tumor-induced angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination. Ectosome-mediated transfer of αvβ5 to endothelial cells promotes tube formation and migration, essential features of tumor neovascularization. Blocking αvβ5 function significantly impairs these processes, establishing it as a central effector of melanoma-associated angiogenesis [ 82 On the metastatic front, carnosic acid has been shown to downregulate integrins α4 (ITGA4) and α9 (ITGA9), reducing melanoma cell adhesion and lung metastasis in vivo [ 95 92 3.5. Integrins and Cell Fate: Senescence, Survival, and Adhesion Recent research uncovers the roles of integrins in cellular senescence and survival, particularly through the Akt1–mTOR–p53/p21 axis. Depletion of integrin α3β1 or α2β1 in melanoma cells leads to growth arrest and senescence, accompanied by increased p53 and mTOR activity. This suggests a protective role for these integrins against premature senescence and highlights pro-senescence therapy as a potential therapeutic angle [ 87 In contrast, NECTIN1, an adherens junction component, suppresses metastasis by promoting cell–cell over cell–matrix adhesion. Loss of NECTIN1 causes a phenotypic switch that facilitates matrix-dependent migration, particularly under low IGF1 conditions. These findings reveal how integrin and adhesion proteins affect melanoma cell plasticity, dissemination, and dormancy escape [ 89 3.6. Integrins as Immunomodulators and Immunotherapy Enablers Integrins also regulate immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. The αvβ8 integrin, expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs), activates latent TGF-β, contributing to immune evasion. Blocking this pathway enhances anti-tumor immunity and could improve checkpoint blockade efficacy [ 93 Conversely, integrin-targeted therapies can augment immune responses. The 4S5NG–PE24 conjugate, beyond inducing pyroptosis, enhances PD-1 checkpoint blockade [ 49 88 The integration of integrin expression profiling into clinical diagnostics has opened new avenues for patient stratification and personalized therapy. Concentrating on particular integrin subunits may lead to early tumor detection and treatment response monitoring. The translational research regarding integrin signaling in melanoma emphasizes its relevance to tumor biology and innovative clinical targets development. Future perspectives should elucidate heterogeneity of integrin in melanoma subtypes and combine synergistic therapeutic approaches that utilize integrin signaling vulnerabilities. 4. Discussion Studies from 2021 to 2025 highlight the crucial role of integrins in melanoma progression, drug resistance, and the development of targeted therapies. The first axis—peptide 4S5NG-PE24—selectively targets integrin α6 + 49 The extracellular vesicle-mediated nanotherapies, like melanoma-derived ectosomes, transfer αvβ3/αvβ5 integrins to endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis by blocking αvβ5, not αvβ3, which most significantly impairs angiogenesis. This idea shifts the therapeutic focus from αvβ3 to αvβ5, challenging long-held assumptions in anti-angiogenic therapy [ 82 97 98 99 100 101 102 The third axis, based on targeting regulatory elements of integrin function (e.g., SERPINB8, talin2, ILK), provides a more dynamic and indirect therapeutic approach, especially for enhancing chemotherapy sensitivity and overcoming drug resistance. Some regulators (e.g., SERPINB8) have context-dependent roles: while it acts as a tumor promoter in melanoma, it functions as a suppressor in other cancers, raising concerns about off-target effects or conflicting biological roles in multi-tumor patients. ILK inhibition has systemic implications due to its pleiotropic roles in multiple cell types (cardiac, vascular, immune), and combining it with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, may result in unpredictable toxicity. Chemotherapy sensitization via talin2–KANK2 or ILK pathways is largely studied in 2D monolayer cultures. These models do not replicate 3D ECM context or stromal interactions critical for integrin behavior [ 84 85 91 The integrin-mediated control of angiogenesis and metastasis axis confirms the role of integrins (especially αvβ5) and non-integrin adhesion receptors (e.g., CD36) in tumor angiogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry, and metastatic dissemination, particularly to the lungs. While targeting αvβ5 shows promise, blocking angiogenesis due to the tumor adaptation via alternative vascular pathways (e.g., VM) is a challenging matter [ 82 92 The fifth axis, based on the connection of integrins and cell fate, reveals that integrins α3β1 and α2β1 are shown to prevent premature senescence, supporting a pro-survival role in melanoma [ 87 89 Integrins as immunomodulators and immunotherapy enablers show that integrins like αvβ8 on Tregs activate TGF-β, supporting immune evasion, while integrin-targeted platforms (e.g., 4S5NG–PE24 and cRGD-siSTAT3) enhance immune checkpoint therapy and gene silencing. This axis aligns integrin biology with modern immuno-oncology paradigms. αvβ8 is not consistently expressed across melanoma subtypes, and targeting it may have limited applicability. Moreover, Tregs are essential for immune homeostasis, and systemic αvβ8 blockade could trigger autoimmune responses. Delivery platforms like cRGD liposomes face challenges in nuclease resistance, endosomal escape, and scalability for clinical use. Combining pyroptotic agents (e.g., PE24) with PD-1 inhibitors can cause excessive immune activation, raising the possibility of cytokine release syndromes or tissue damage in patients. Studies often rely on subcutaneous tumor models, which lack the complex immune architecture of human melanoma and cannot predict immune-related adverse events accurately. Absence of patient-derived melanoma models or syngeneic immunocompetent models hinders the translation of immunomodulatory findings [ 49 88 93 The expanding landscape of integrin research in melanoma reflects a transition from static structural roles to dynamic regulatory and therapeutic functions. The described six axes—ranging from precision peptide–toxin delivery to immune and microenvironmental modulation—highlight integrins as multidimensional therapeutic targets. Integrin-focused strategies are particularly promising due to their: tumor specificity (e.g., α6, αvβ3, and αvβ5), therapeutic synergy (e.g., immunotherapy and chemotherapy), delivery flexibility (e.g., EVs and liposomes), and regulatory depth (e.g., protease networks and actin-MT crosstalk). Future work should focus on enhancing clinical translatability of integrin-targeted platforms, developing isoform-specific inhibitors or ligands, exploring biomarker-guided patient stratification, and integrating multi-omic profiling to uncover novel integrin regulatory circuits. Together, these integrin-directed innovations position themselves at the forefront of next-generation melanoma therapy. The challenging question is whether the natural products such as vitamin D derivatives and melatonin with its metabolites [ 103 104 105 106 107 1 105 108 109 110 It is worth mentioning that acral melanoma is a distinct and rare subtype of melanoma that arises on the palms, soles, and nail beds. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, acral melanoma is not associated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, suggesting alternative mechanisms drive its initiation and progression. Recent studies indicate that integrins—transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling—play a pivotal role in acral melanoma biology. Altered expression of specific integrin subunits has been implicated in promoting tumor invasion, resistance to therapy, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Given the unique pathogenesis of acral melanoma, integrin-mediated pathways may offer subtype-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Further investigation into integrin signaling could improve understanding of acral melanoma progression and guide the development of precision treatments for this challenging melanoma variant [ 111 112 113 Collectively, these findings broaden the concept that the integrins are not isolated adhesion molecules, but central regulators of melanoma cell fate, invasion, immune resistance, and therapeutic responsiveness. Their subtype-specific functions, dynamic regulation, and integration into multiple oncogenic pathways make them compelling yet complex therapeutic targets. Future research should focus on integrin–ECM interactions in well-defined melanoma subtypes to evaluate combinatorial targeting approaches and explore the integration of natural compounds with established and experimental integrin-based therapies to overcome resistance and limit metastatic spread. 5. Conclusions Six key research axes highlight integrins as multifaceted regulators of melanoma progression, therapeutic resistance, and immune evasion. While each axis demonstrates therapeutic potential, its translational success will depend on addressing specific contradictions, methodological gaps, and biological complexities. Integrin-targeted therapies are no longer limited to inhibiting adhesion; they now span cytotoxic payload delivery, immune modulation, and therapy sensitization. Their integration into clinical oncology pipelines should follow a biomarker-driven, multi-modal approach, with a strong emphasis on tumor selectivity, immune context, and safety. In conclusion, integrins have emerged as central regulators in melanoma progression, drug resistance, and immune escape, offering multiple points of therapeutic intervention. Among the current strategies, α6-targeted peptide–toxin conjugates hold clinical promise due to their tumor specificity and ability to synergize with immunotherapy. However, broader clinical success will require moving beyond isolated targets and toward integrin-guided combination therapies that integrate immune modulation, metastasis inhibition, and drug delivery. Future research must prioritize biomarker-driven patient stratification, validation in complex, immunocompetent models, and the development of real-time imaging tools to monitor integrin activity. Clinically, integrins should no longer be viewed as passive adhesion molecules but as actionable hubs for precision oncology.
