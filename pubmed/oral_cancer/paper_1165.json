Neutrophils play an important role in innate immune response. The activation of neutrophils leads to the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to various stimuli. Appropriate NETs are essential for maintaining homeostasis in the body, while excessive NETs will cause pathological damage. Accumulating evidence indicates that NETs are implicated in CVD pathophysiology. This review aims to provide a comprehensive review of the characteristics, signaling pathways, and interactions of NETs with other immune cells, and the comparisons of NETosis with other cell deaths, focusing on the role of NETs in CVDs. Furthermore, this study provides a theoretical basis for further improvement in targeted NET therapy for CVD. cardiovascular disease neutrophils neutrophil extracellular traps National Natural Science Foundation of China 82274317 82305194 82161138017 Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China 2023M731222 This work was financially supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82274317, 82305194, 82161138017), and the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (2023M731222). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally with a morbidity of youth-oriented tendency over the years, increasing healthcare and financial burden on society. Immune response and inflammation are involved in the occurrence and progression of CVD, manifesting as the sterile inflammation with infiltration of immune cells into lesions. Therefore, the role of the immune system in cardiovascular injury has received increasing attention. Immune cells have recently been in the spotlight of “Cardioprotection Beyond the Cardiomyocyte” [ 1 1 2 Neutrophils are an essential component of innate immune cells, accounting for 40–70% of all circulating leukocytes, and serve as the initial defense against invading pathogens [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 Several studies have demonstrated that NETs play a pivotal role in CVD pathophysiology, including atherosclerosis [ 9 10 11 1 2. Characteristics and Functions of NETs Since Brinkmann’s groundbreaking work, the composition and formation mechanisms of NETs have been the focus of intense research, but extensive studies are still lacking. The precise triggers that initiate NET formation remain debatable and controversial. Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin in eukaryotic nuclei and are composed of histones and DNA. Histones bind to DNA via electrostatic interactions under physiological conditions. Citrullination of histone reduce their positive charge, weakens the histone-DNA affinity, and promotes chromatin decondensation. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) mediates histone hypercitrullination, and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) is a marker of NET formation [ 12 Figure 1 13 PAD4 is a calcium ion (Ca 2+ 2+ 14 2+ 15 2+ 2+ 2+ 16 17 2+ Figure 1 18 2+ 2+ 19 20 21 Figure 1 2+ 22 23 24 2+ 2+ 25 2+ Additionally, ROS plays a critical role in initiating NETosis and activating PAD4. In 2007, overgenerated ROS was an absolute requisite for inducing NETosis [ 26 27 28 29 2+ Figure 1 26 Platelets [ 16 16 Staphylococcus aureus 30 2+ 19 2+ 31 Figure 1 3. NET Signaling Pathway NETs play a crucial role in tissue repair and defense and are regulated by multiple signaling pathways. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway enhances NET formation by activating NADPH oxidase and anti-apoptotic proteins; this process can be inhibited by compounds such GW5074 and U0126 [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 20 Additionally, researchers have found that NETs respond to multiple signaling pathways and actively participate in the activating these signaling pathways and influencing disease progression. In acute brain injury, NETs exacerbate tissue damage via the STING-IRE1α/ASK1/JNK pathway, which can be mitigated by PAD4 inhibition [ 39 40 41 42 The precise mechanisms by which NETs contribute to disease pathogenesis are not yet fully understood, highlighting the need for further investigation of their regulatory pathways to uncover potential therapeutic strategies. 4. Interaction of NETs with Other Immune Cells Neutrophils, as the vanguard of the immune system’s defense against pathogen invasion, are typically the first responders recruited to the site of inflammation. Additionally, neutrophils play a crucial role in orchestrating the immune response by interacting with other immune cells and contributing to disease initiation and progression. Mounting evidence suggests that NETs serve as a critical mechanism by which neutrophils engage with and modulate the activity of other immune cells ( Figure 2 During the immune response, T cells serve as the primary defense against the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms. Recent studies have indicated that NETs can effect T-cell differentiation [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 NET also mediates B-cell differentiation [ 49 50 Figure 2 51 52 Natural killer (NK) cells are the primary effectors of almost all the immune functions within the lymphatic system. They contribute to thrombosis by promoting NET formation via type II interferon γ (IFN-γ) secretion ( Figure 2 53 54 55 56 Dendritic cells (DCs) may play a central role in initiating, orchestrating, and sustaining the immune response. Scientists have discovered that NETs induced by free fatty acids can further activate DCs [ 46 57 Figure 2 Mast cells (MCs) are tissue-resident cells that secrete various cytokines to drive allergic reactions and serve as key mediators for the recruitment of neutrophils [ 58 59 60 61 58 Figure 2 Macrophages are closely associated with NETs and can facilitate their formation via the ROS/GSDMD axis [ 62 63 64 65 66 5. Distinction Between NETosis and Other Cell Deaths In Branklin’s Prototype mode, NETosis differs from apoptosis or necrosis. Additionally, pharmacologically, the various modes of cell death require distinct agonists [ 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 Table 1 Apoptosis, first identified in 1972 [ 76 77 74 78 79 In 2012, Dixon et al. first identified ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death that differs from apoptosis and necrosis [ 80 75 Pyroptosis has been recognized as a unique form of programmed cell death since its discovery in 1992. It follows a classical pathway involving caspase-1 activation, which cleaves GSDMD, leading to cell membrane perforation. The resulting membrane pores allow for the release of inflammatory factors and disrupt cellular control over substance transport, ultimately triggering pyroptosis. Research has also revealed that GSDMD participates in NET formation, and NETs significantly influence pyroptotic. This link between NETosis and pyroptosis has been observed in various cell types, including macrophages [ 81 82 6. The Roles of NETs in CVDs 6.1. NETs in Thrombosis Ischemic heart disease and stroke were the leading thromboembolic disease that caused disability and death in 2019 [ 83 Emerging evidence has indicated the complexity of thrombosis. Recent findings suggest that NETs contribute to thrombosis, a phenomenon that has not been fully recognized yet. Perdomo et al. found that NETosis is essential for thrombus formation in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and the inhibition of NETs could be exploited therapeutically [ 84 Thrombosis can be induced by the initiating a coagulation cascade that is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that NETs can directly stimulate the coagulation cascades. Tissue factor (TF) is a major mediator of thrombosis and is vital for the primary activation of coagulation [ 85 86 87 Recently, researchers found that NETs are involved in the initiation of complement activation. Bryan et al. found that C3 −/− 30 88 89 90 Platelets are essential components of hemostasis and thrombosis. Mounting evidence suggests that platelets may play a pivotal role in NET formation [ 91 92 93 Hmgb1 −/− 93 Figure 3 Chilingaryan et al. discovered the potential involvement of NETs induced by erythrocytes through activation platelets in coronary arterial thrombosis. Strongly expressed CitH3 were observed in all human thrombi, confirming that NETs are a common component of coronary thrombosis [ 94 In summary, NETs orchestrate the activation of white blood cells, platelets, and endothelial cells, thereby eliciting robust pro-inflammatory responses that culminate in endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, the intricate network structure of NETs serves as a scaffold for thrombus formation. Additionally, NETs facilitate thrombosis by engaging in complex interactions with coagulation factors, complement factors, platelets, endothelial cells, and RBCs ( Figure 3 6.2. NETs in Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is widely acknowledged as a chronic inflammatory and lipid-driven disease that is the foremost cause of CAD, carotid artery disease, and peripheral arterial disease within the cardiovascular system. The compromised or diseased intima frequently serves as the primary instigator of this condition. In response, inflammatory cells are summoned to the site of injury, adhering to the vessel wall, fostering plaque formation, progressively narrowing the vessel lumen, and hindering blood flow. As the pathology advances, plaque rupture may ensue, further exacerbating the detrimental effects and precipitating more severe pathological damage. Megens et al. pioneered the discovery of NETs in atherosclerotic lesions in murine models and humans [ 95 96 97 98 63 Basic and clinical research data have proven that a series of pathophysiological changes caused by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) are the key to the formation of atherosclerosis and are closely related to the severity of atherosclerosis [ 99 100 101 102 High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is renowned for its vascular protective properties. However, when apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I), a predominant protein in HDL, is oxidized by chlorination or nitration of tyrosine residues (Cl-Tyr and n-Tyr oxidizing HDL, respectively), the vasoprotective ability of the lipoprotein is weakened while it gains pro-inflammatory activity [ 103 103 NETs can also react in other ways to atherosclerosis. Studies have demonstrated that NETs accelerate atherosclerosis during endotoxemia by mediating charge-dependent monocyte adhesion to NETs [ 104 105 Figure 3 6.3. NETs in MI Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a devastating condition characterized by myocardial, resulting from acute and sustained ischemia and hypoxia in the coronary arteries. It is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. AMI predominantly arises in the backdrop of coronary atherosclerosis, typically manifesting as lumen occlusion due to thrombosis following the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. Moreover, coronary artery spasm also plays a significant role as a hidden culprit in heart attacks. The involvement of inflammation in the CVD progression was first supported by the Physician’s Health Study [ 96 64 Microthrombosis has been reported to be associated with cardiac microvascular dysfunction or disturbances with AMI [ 106 NETs participate in the formation of ventricular aneurysms after MI [ 107 108 109 Figure 3 However, the role of NETs inhibition in MI remains debatable. In 2019, Du et al. were the first to report that inhibiting PAD4, the essential enzyme for driving NETosis, by GSK484 exerts a protective effect on MI. Their findings revealed that GSK484 significantly reduced infarct size and serum myocardial enzyme concentrations. Simultaneously, it downregulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, thereby mitigating the MI-induced apoptosis of myocardial cells [ 110 111 6.4. NETs in Myocardial Ischemia–Reperfusion (MI/R) Although thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can effectively and promptly achieve myocardial reperfusion to ameliorate acute myocardial ischemic injury [ 112 In 2015, Ge et al. demonstrated the existence of NETs in I/R-challenged myocardium [ 113 114 11 NETs may further exacerbate MI/R injury by upregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response and aggravating tissue damage. Considerable research has demonstrated that extracellular histone released during NETosis is pro-inflammatory, and they can bind and activate TLR2/4/9 on innate immune cells, thereby initiating the MyD88-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, releasing downstream pro-inflammatory factors, and establishing a sterile inflammatory environment, ultimately inducing myocardial damage [ 115 116 The phenomenon of no-reflow has been reported to underlie the occurrence of reperfusion injury, contributing significantly to its pathophysiology. Shao et al. indicated that microthrombosis is involved in the occurrence of cardiac non-reflow phenomenon in rats with acute MI/R [ 106 113 In summary, ischemia reperfusion injury can release ROS and upregulate cytokines, which are vital for the NET formation. Accordingly, NETs exacerbate IR injury by engaging its primary components with cytokines, thereby fueling inflammation and microthrombosis and creating a vicious cycle that amplifies tissue damage ( Figure 3 6.5. NETs in Heart Failure (HF) HF is a clinical syndrome caused by impaired cardiac pumping function that prevents the heart from meeting the body’s metabolic needs [ 117 118 119 Based on the measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction, HF is categorized into three types: HF with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF), HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF), and HF with Mid-Range Ejection Fraction (HFmrEF), based on the measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction [ 120 121 122 123 124 125 In 2024, scientists used endomyocardial biopsy samples to confirm the clinical relevance and prognostic value of NETs in HF and dilated cardiomyopathy for the first time. These findings suggested that NETs may worsen cardiac dysfunction by causing mitochondrial damage [ 126 127 In addition to studies based on clinical samples, numerous researchers have explored the impact of NETs on HF by constructing HF models in animals. Researchers have found that, in TAC-induced HF mouse models, NETs trigger cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, impairing mitochondrial biological processes. Moreover, sacubitril/valsartan, commonly used to treat HFrEF, can inhibit NETosis via the VWF-SLC44A2-NET axis and improve HF prognosis [ 128 129 117 130 131 Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are frequently used in clinical practice as therapeutic interventions for patients with end-stage HF. A study comparing the levels of CITH3-NET markers in the serum of patients with HF before and after LVAD implantation found that NET levels dropped below the baseline [ 119 132 Overall, NET levels are elevated and contribute to disease progression in patients with HF, especially those with HFpEF. Inhibiting NET formation using targeted therapies may significantly reduce HF severity and improve clinical outcomes. Additionally, LVAD, a common treatment for advanced HF, reduce NET formation and provides therapeutic benefits. 6.6. NETs in Vasculitis-Associated Rheumatic Disorders There is increasing evidence for the central role of neutrophils in the vasculitic responses. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is an autoimmune disease involving multiple systems throughout the body that is associated with the alternative complement pathway (AP). The ANCA-mediated activation of neutrophils has been proven to induce NET formation. Additionally, proteinase-3 and MPO, the components of NETs, as auto-antigen of ANCA, can continuously worsen the immune response of AAV patients [ 133 134 Neutrophils produce and release adenosine at the site of inflammation, which can regulate various functions of neutrophils in turn. Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is a recessively inherited autoinflammatory disease caused by a functional loss or mutation of the ADA2 gene, resulting in systemic vasculitis. In 2019, Carmona-Rivera et al. first reported enhancement of extracellular adenosine-mediated NET formation in DADA2. They found a significant reduction in NET formation with inhibition of NOX or PADs after adenosine stimulation, indicating that adenosine induces NETosis via NOX- and PAD-dependent pathways in DADA2 pathogenesis [ 135 Weckbach et al. reported the presence of NETs in the cardiac tissue of patients and mice with myocarditis. NETs promote cardiac inflammation in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). Tnd blocking of cytokine MK reduce NET + 136 Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as Hoghes syndrome, clinically manifested as recurrent thrombotic events and miscarriages. Given the well-established link between NETosis and thrombosis, we hypothesized that NETs may play a significant role in APS pathogenesis. It has been demonstrated that neutrophils in patients with APS are apt to overgenerate NETs, which is attributed to the involvement of human antiphospholipid antibodies and monoclonal antibodies, and research also suggest that these circulating NETs contribute to thrombotic events [ 137 138 139 In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), neutrophils, especially NETs, have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role both in the initiation and maintenance of the aberrant immune responses, including the development of organ damage and vasculopathy [ 140 Figure 3 141 142 143 6.7. NETs in Aortic Aneurysm An aortic aneurysm is characterized by a pathological dilation of the aorta (>50% of its normal diameter) and presents a significant risk of mortality. The most prevalent form is AAA. Inflammation has recently emerged as a pivotal factor in AAA development, with circulating neutrophils playing a dominant role in the early stages. Studies have revealed that NETs are essential drivers of AAA ( Figure 3 144 145 146 Figure 3 147 Increasing evidence indicated that inhibition of neutrophil migration and NET formation can alleviate AAA. Wei et al. reported that YW3-56, a PAD4 inhibitor, significantly alleviated Ang II-induced AAA rupture by blocking NETs formation [ 148 149 150 151 7. Potential Therapy Targeting NETs As NETs are gradually gaining importance in basic research, pharmacological strategies aimed at targeting NETs are emerging as a promising frontiers across a spectrum of disease models. Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotics, has been demonstrated to reduce the production of NETs in smoking-related chronic pulmonary inflammation [ 152 153 Cytotoxic proteases, the primary component of NETs, play a pivotal role in eliminating pathogens, but may also cause injury to the surrounding tissue and cells in excess. Pieterse suggested that targeting NE in NETs may serve as a therapeutic strategy for managing vascular leakage. Inhibition of the physiological function of NETs alleviates their mediated vascular leakage and promotes fibrosis under inflammatory conditions [ 154 63 155 107 Although numerous methods are available to detect NETs in basic research, the clinical detection of NETs is constrained by variations in sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility [ 156 157 8. Challenges and Future Directions Neutrophils, as indispensable guardians of the body’s immune system, have been increasingly recognized for their pivotal role in orchestrating a myriad of cardiovascular events. NETs, which function as an impressive and sophisticated defense mechanism against a myriad of pathogens, have increasingly captured the attention of the scientific community in recent years. Although NETs play an important role in maintaining homeostasis, excessive NETs can cause pathological damage. As discussed above, NETs are indeed important and significantly affect the initiation and progression of CVDs, especially in the pathophysiology of thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Most functional studies have been conducted using mice and other animals. However, studies have demonstrated that the expression and characteristics of neutrophils vary significantly across different biological species. Accordingly, more clinical trials are needed to confirm the feasibility of targeting NETs for CVD treatment. In addition, NETs play a vital role as the first line of defense against invaders; therefore, long-term targeted therapy in chronic CVDs may come at the expense of weakening host defense, which is also an issue that cannot be ignored in the developing of related therapies. In summary, achieving an optimal balance between preserving the reparative functions of neutrophils and mitigating their pro-inflammatory effects is paramount. This delicate equilibrium is crucial for identifying and refining the most appropriate molecular targets and ultimately paving the way for innovative and effective therapeutic approaches in cardiovascular medicine.

ELISA detection of MPO-DNA complexes in human plasma is error-prone and yields limited information on neutrophil extracellular traps formed PLoS ONE 2021 16 e0250265 10.1371/journal.pone.0250265 33886636 PMC8062102 Figure 1 Mechanisms of NET formation. Two types of NET formation process (NETosis): “suicidal” and “vital.” Various materials include PMA, cytokines, and platelets, and can induce “suicidal” NETosis. Then kinase signaling cascades are activated, followed by a sequence of reactions including the deconstruction and release of chromatin into the cytoplasm, resulting in the interweaving of cytoplasm and karyoplasm; then NETs are released into the extracellular space, where NETs can exert their biological effects. Another kind of NETosis is called “vital” NETosis, which can be activated by platelets, complement proteins, and Gram-positive bacteria. In this process, after the materials are assembled in the nucleus, transport vesicles containing NETs are formed and germinated into the extracellular space without destroying the plasma membrane.

NETs have been proven to be involved in pathophysiology of CVDs, including atherosclerosis, thrombosis, vasculitis, aortic aneurysm, and multiple types of coronary artery disease. biomolecules-15-01263-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Major types of cell death.
