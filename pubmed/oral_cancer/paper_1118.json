Combining immunotherapy with brain radiation could be more effective than either treatment alone, but the optimal timing of this combination is unknown. Using real-world data from older adults who had brain metastases at diagnosis of NSCLC, we compared surival outcomes of the combination therapy that was administered within different timing windows. This population is largely underrepresented in clinical trials. Our findings could help clinicians optimize combination treatment strategies for these patients who are at high risk of poor survival outcomes. Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) display efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with brain metastases (BMs) and studies suggest potential synergy with cranial radiation (CR). However, population-based evaluations of optimal time between ICI-CR combinations are limited in the US. Using SEER-Medicare database (2010–2019), we analyzed patients aged ≥65 years with NSCLC and BM receiving ICI-CR within 6 months of diagnosis, excluding those receiving targeted therapies. First treatment after diagnosis (ICI or CR) was defined as index treatment; followed by subsequent treatment. Findings were validated using an independent cohort from the TriNetX LIVE™ Platform. Patients were grouped by interval between the end of the index treatment and the start of the subsequent treatment: ≤15 days (n = 117), 16–30 days (n = 42), and >30 days (n = 77). Overall survival (OS) was measured from the start of the subsequent treatment until death, end of insurance coverage, or study end. Kaplan–Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models estimated differences between groups. Among 236 patients, median OS was 134 days, 92 days, and 209 days, respectively. No significant OS differences were found across intervals. However, a survival benefit emerged approximately 300 days after follow-up when ICI was administered within 15 days of CR. These findings offer insight into treatment sequencing in NSCLC with BM and support further investigation in larger cohorts. immune checkpoint inhibitors cranial radiation non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis older adults concurrent treatment University of Utah National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health UL1 TR003107-02S2 American Cancer Society RSGI-23-1039245-01-HOPS Arkansas Biosciences Institute C.L. received research support for unrelated projects sponsored by the University of Utah/AstraZeneca.

Introduction Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 5 While SCLC initially responds better to chemotherapy, NSCLC’s genomic diversity has allowed targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to transform treatment of advanced NSCLC [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 13 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 However, clinical trial data on ICI–radiation synergy in NSCLC are limited to extracranial radiotherapy and with mixed findings. The PACIFIC trial showed improved progression-free survival and OS among patients with unresectable stage 3 NSCLC who received durvalumab within 42 days after completion of chemoradiation [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 32 Currently, reports of efficacy and tolerability of combined ICI-CR treatment for BM primarily stem from retrospective series that focused on melanoma patients [ 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 Supplementary Table S1 42 45 47 46 49 47 39 46 42 45 48 49 50 51 24 52 To address these gaps, we used a large population-based dataset to compare survival outcomes across three clinically meaningful time windows for ICI administration relative to CR (2 weeks, 30 days, and 31–180 days) within 6 months after a diagnosis of NSCLC and SBM. Our study represents a significant advancement over prior research. It is the first direct evaluation of timing of the ICI-CR combination, assessing intervals that have previously been shown to be associated with better survival. Also, it establishes the largest cohort, to date, of patients with NSCLC and SBM who were treated with both modalities (all previous studies included N < 90). Finally, it focuses on two critically understudied populations—patients with untreated SBM, who typically are excluded from clinical trials and are older adults (≥65 years; mean: 73 years) who comprise >70% of NSCLC cases [ 53 54 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Source This study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) cancer registry data by National Cancer Institute (NCI), which captures data from 34.6% of patients with cancer in the US and contains information on demographic, tumor, and treatment-related covariates at the diagnosis of the primary malignancy. The methodology, structure, and data collection methods were described elsewhere [ 55 56 57 2.2. Study Sample The study cohort included patients who received a diagnosis of NSCLC and SBM between 2010 and 2017 and who were treated with both ICIs and CR (SRS and non-SRS) within 6 months of diagnosis, a window that captures initial treatments and minimizes the possibility of treatment for disease progression. Patients with NSCLC and SBM were identified by ICD-O-3 codes for primary malignant neoplasm of bronchia and lung with NSCLC histology [ 58 For our analyses, we selected data from records of patients who met the following criteria: 1) NSCLC diagnosis at age ≥65 years, (2) NSCLC identified as sole primary cancer, (3) evidence of BM at NSCLC diagnosis, (4) uninterrupted enrollment in Medicare Part A (inpatient) and Part B (outpatient and physician services) but not Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage) for a at least minimum of 6 months before diagnosis (for assessment of baseline comorbidities and performance status) and continuing until “ follow-up start date” 58 58 59 60 Appendix A 2.3. Treatment Groups We analyzed data from patients who received ICI and CR within 6 months after receiving a diagnosis of NSCLC and SBM. Focusing on ICI and CR, the first treatment with either ICI or CR after diagnosis was designated as the index treatment. If a patient switched to the other treatment (e.g., from ICI to CR or vice versa), then the new treatment was classified as subsequent treatment. The switch was marked by the last claim for index treatment and the first claim for subsequent treatment. The time interval between these two dates was calculated in days. Based on this interval, patients were classified into three study groups: ≤15 days, 16–30 days, and >30 days. Patients were followed from the start of the subsequent treatment (i.e., follow-up start date Figure 1 2.4. Survival Outcome The primary study outcome was OS time, defined as number of days from start of follow-up until death. For patients who remained alive, survival times were censored at first occurrence of (1) loss of enrollment in Medicare Parts A and B, (2) enrollment in Medicare Advantage (Part C), or (3) end of data availability (31 December 2019). 2.5. Covariates Covariates (available in SEER-Medicare database) were selected for their relevance to survival and/or receipt of treatment, according to our review of the published literature [ 61 62 63 64 65 66 Appendix A 2.6. Statistical Analysis The patient characteristics of the three study groups were compared with standard t-tests for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables whenever appropriate. Outcomes were evaluated with survival analysis techniques. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier (KM) method and between-group comparisons of curves were performed using a log rank test. Adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazards (CPH) regression was used to determine hazard ratios while controlling for potential confounders. We found that the KM curves overlapped twice with delayed separation, indicating a violation of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption. To account for this violation, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by classifying our sample as ICI-CR administered within 15 days and >15 days. We then estimated a multivariable CPH model with two “change points” [ 67 p Since previous studies focused only on SRS types of CR, we conducted a subgroup analysis of data from patients who received ICI with SRS by using an adjusted multivariable CPH model. Given the distinct clinical profiles of patients who received SRS vs. non-SRS radiation (e.g., recipients of whole-brain radiotherapy typically present with greater metastatic burden), we performed an exploratory subgroup analysis of non-SRS population by using similarly adjusted models. A p 2.7. Validation Study To externally validate our findings, we also performed additional analyses using TriNetX LIVE™, a web-based platform which provides access to de-identified electronic health records from healthcare organizations worldwide. This platform allows for real-time cohort building and preliminary outcome analysis across diverse patient populations. We detailed the methods and results for the TriNetX analysis are available in the Supplementary Materials 3. Results After we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a final study sample of 236 patients remained for the primary analysis (subsequent ICI/CR treatment received ≤15 days: n = 117; 16–30 days: n = 42; >30 days: n = 77). Figure 2 p p Table 1 Median survival was shortest for the 16–30 days group (92 days; 95% CI: 54–291), followed by the ≤15 days group (134 days; 95% CI: 101–181), and was longest for the >30 days group (209 days; 95% CI: 130–306); however, the log rank test showed no significant differences ( Figure 3 Table 2 Under the “change point” CPH model, the hazard of death for the ≤15 days group was significantly lower than the >15 days group only after 300 days from the follow-up start date ( Supplementary Table S2 Similar to results of the primary analysis, hazard of death between the study groups was not significantly different after using KM curves, log rank test ( Supplementary Figure S1a,b Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 Findings from the TriNetX validation cohort were consistent with those from the SEER-Medicare, showing no significant overall survival differences across ICI–CR timing intervals using KM curves and log rank test ( Supplementary Figure S2a–c 4. Discussion In this population-based retrospective study, we compared survival outcomes of US patients with NSCLC and SBM, ages 65 years or older, after receiving ICIs and CR 15 days, 16–30 days, and >30 days apart, with both treatments administered within 6 months after diagnosis. Our analyses showed no significant differences in OS after ICI and CR were administered at these different time intervals. Subgroups analyses of patients who received either SRS or non-SRS with ICI produced similar results. However, for the group that received ICI within 15 days of CR, a survival benefit was observed 300 days after the start of the follow-up. Importantly, we validated our findings using the TriNetX LIVE™ Platform, which provided a complementary real-world cohort. The consistency of results across two independent datasets strengthens the robustness and generalizability of our conclusions. Our findings on OS in patients with NSCLC and BM who were treated with SRS and ICI align with results of one previous study but contrast with those of other studies, underscoring the impact of the variable definitions for concurrent therapy. Consistent with our results, Ahmed et al. (2017) [ 37 42 47 This lack of consensus likely stems from discrepancies in optimal timing and study methodology. The aforementioned studies included less uniform populations—patients who had NSCLC together with SBM (BM at diagnosis) or metachronous BM (developed after diagnosis); our study included only patients who had NSCLC with SBM, a group that is reported to have shorter survival than those with NSCLC and metachronous BM [ 68 69 While no statistically significant differences were found across the intervals, a delayed survival benefit, approximately 300 days after the combination treatment, emerged among patients who received both treatments within 15 days of each other, which warrants further investigation. Preclinical evidence suggests that this delayed effect may stem from the time required for radiation-induced cell death to activate systemic T-cell responses [ 24 52 52 23 24 Figure 3 Our study has several strengths. First, it addresses the underrepresentation of real-world NSCLC populations in the literature; most previous retrospective studies were limited to single-center cohorts. Secondly, existing evidence on the combination of ICI and CR primarily focuses on SRS, even though focal radiation, compared to WBRT, may increase the risk of distant brain failure in patients with NSCLC [ 70 However, some limitations must be considered. First, although we examined various time windows for ICI and CR combination treatment, there may still be uncertainty about the effects of radiation on T-cell activation. Second, important prognostic factors such as smoking, EGFR/ALK mutations, and performance status were not available in our data. Nonetheless, we excluded patients who received NSCLC-specific targeted therapies to mitigate potential mutation-related confounding, and we used a validated proxy measure for performance status [ 65 66 71 72 73 5. Conclusions This population-based study of older patients with NSCLC and SBM showed no significant difference in OS when ICI and CR were administered within ≤15 days, 16–30 days, or 31–180 days after diagnosis. Notably, we observed a potential delayed survival benefit 300 days after the combination therapy among patients who received ICI ≤15 days of CR, suggesting that early combination therapy may be advantageous. However, the number of patients remaining in each group after 300 days resulted in small samples for this analysis, so large prospective studies are needed to validate this finding and to investigate potential heterogeneity among patients with comorbidities or with newer immunotherapy regimens.
