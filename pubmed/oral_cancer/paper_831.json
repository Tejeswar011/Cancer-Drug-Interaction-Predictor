Its combination with clavulanic acid maintains its known activity against strains producing β-lactamase. There are limited studies on adverse reactions and antibiotic resistance, with researchers relying primarily on databanks that report spontaneous events caused by amoxicillin or the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Antimicrobial resistance is an overlooked adverse event, and pharmacovigilance databases could serve as a tool in tracking resistance. On this basis, a study to define the safety profile of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and to increase the knowledge necessary to support the battle against antimicrobial resistance was undertaken through the analysis of pharmacovigilance databases. Suspected adverse reactions to amoxicillin and to the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the data system EudraVigilance (2020–2024) were analyzed. The most frequent alerts concerned “Skin and subcutaneous disorders” for both drugs. Disproportionate analysis of cases concerning “Hepatobiliary disorders” or “Drug inefficiency” indicates a significant increase in these alerts with the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination compared to amoxicillin. The amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination has previously been associated with a higher risk of hepatotoxicity and antibiotic resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; however, this is the first time that a post-marketing surveillance study has shown that antimicrobial resistance is more likely to occur with the combination in comparison to amoxicillin alone. amoxicillin amoxicillin/clavulanic acid antimicrobial resistance antibiotic resistance hepatotoxicity liver toxicity pharmacovigilance adverse reactions This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The semisynthetic combination of penicillin–amoxicillin was generated with the addition of an extra amino group to penicillin. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic characterized by its core beta-lactam ring and a p-hydroxyphenylglycylamino side chain, giving it the molecular formula C 16 19 3 5 1 2 3 8 9 5 4 Helicobacter pylori 5 Klebsiella pneumoniae Bacteroides fragilis 6 7 8 9 In the research literature, studies using real-world data and investigating adverse reactions and antibiotic resistance, based on databanks reporting spontaneous adverse reactions to medicinal products with amoxicillin and the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, are scarce [ 10 11 On this basis, a study defining the safety profile of adverse reaction signaling and investigating the potential role of pharmacovigilance databases in supporting the battle against antimicrobial resistance was undertaken. This study’s aim was to analyze spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions (SARs) to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in EudraVigilance (2020–2024), with a particular focus on hepatobiliary disorders and reported lack of efficacy, to explore both drug safety and potential antimicrobial resistance signals. 2. Results 2.1. Percentage and Ratio of Serious/Non-Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions A total of 10,329 and 7900 Individual Case Safety reports (ICSRs) related to prescriptions of a combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and amoxicillin, respectively, were identified in the EudraVigilance database as adverse reaction reports in the period from January 2020 to 31 December 2024. Of these reports, 5114 ICSRs linked to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid prescription were categorized as serious cases (a total of 49.5% of the total number of ICSRs were combination-related). Serious ICSRs related to amoxicillin comprised 3685 reports (a total of 46.6% of the total number of ICSRs were amoxicillin-related). An evaluation of the adverse reactions to the combination of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid and to amoxicillin shows that non-serious cases outnumbered serious cases for both drugs, with ratios of 0.98 (combination) and 0.87 (amoxicillin), respectively ( Table 1 2.2. Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions to Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid and Amoxicillin According to the System Organ Class (SOC) Level According to the SOC level, SAR aggregation to the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination and to amoxicillin shows that the most frequent adverse reactions among those signaled in the years 2020–2024 are grouped as “Skin and subcutaneous disorders” followed by “Immune system disorders” for both categories of medicinal products. However, after these two groups of SARs, the next most common group is “Hepatobiliary disorders” for the combination, while for amoxicillin, “General disorders and administration site conditions” is the third most common group of signaled SARs. These groups and the other groups of more frequently signaled SARs are represented in Figure 1 Figure 2 2.3. Sex Distribution of Cases Reporting Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions (SARs) to the Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid Combination and to Amoxicillin According to the System Organ Class (SOC) Level Table 2 Table 3 Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 2.4. Evaluation of Adverse Reactions to Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid and Amoxicillin Categorized as “Hepatobiliary Disorders” Serious reactions belonging to the SOC group “Hepatobiliary disorders” were detected in 257 and 834 cases for amoxicillin and the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination, respectively. Statistical analysis shows an asymmetric sex distribution, since “Hepatobiliary disorders” are more frequent in females treated with amoxicillin and in males treated with the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination ( Table 5 Table 6 2.5. Evaluation of Adverse Reactions to Amoxicillin and Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid Categorized as “Drug Ineffective” For this evaluation, the difference between serious and not serious cases was not maintained. The reaction categorized as “drug ineffective” was detected in 45 and 156 serious and non-serious cases for amoxicillin and for the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination, respectively. Statistical analysis shows that the frequencies of male and female cases are overlapping for amoxicillin, while the sex distribution between the two sexes for the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid indicates that inefficiency against infections is more frequent in females ( Table 7 Table 8 3. Discussion In the present study, we analyzed data on SAR signaling related to amoxicillin and the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the years 2020–2024 in European countries and the UK. These medicinal products show a similar serious/non-serious score of close to one, which is generally considered as acceptable [ 12 13 The most frequent alerts in the EudraVigilance database, in the years taken into consideration, concern “Skin and subcutaneous disorders” followed by “Immune system disorders” for both the combination and amoxicillin alone. This is not a novel discovery, since a 10-month prospective cohort study that included all hospitalized patients and was designed to identify those with adverse cutaneous drug reactions showed that medicinal products containing amoxicillin had the highest reaction rate [ 14 Other authors, through a mixed prospective–retrospective cohort study, found that the skin and subcutaneous system, together with the gastrointestinal system, was commonly affected by amoxicillin alone or in combination, while respiratory thoracic disorders, the nervous system, and general disorders were not usually involved [ 15 16 Skin and immune disorders caused by medicinal products containing amoxicillin are probably closely related. Among all beta-lactams, amoxicillin is a frequently used drug for sensitization. Cutaneous amoxicillin-mediated reactions can be classified as immediate or delayed reactions; the former are believed to be mediated by IgE [ 17 Among its various mechanisms, amoxicillin can alter immune system activity, and it has been shown that amoxicillin decreases phagocytosis and macrophage chemotaxis [ 18 19 The sex distribution shows the prevalence of female cases of “Gastrointestinal disorders” and “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” in SARs signaling to both amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and amoxicillin. Alerts for “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” show an asymmetry in sex distribution for the two medicinal product categories, as there is a prevalence of female cases for amoxicillin alone compared to male cases for the combination. Disproportionate analysis performed using ROR indicates a potential increase in the risk of “Hepatobiliary disorders” due to the use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination in comparison to that of amoxicillin alone. In the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), “Hepatobiliary disorders” represent a group of adverse reactions classified according to the System Organ Class (SOC). This group includes terms describing pathological conditions of the liver (hepato-) and of the biliary system (biliary). “Hepatobiliary disorders” are non-oncologic or oncologic disorders that affect the liver, bile ducts, and/or gallbladder. Examples include hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cholangitis [ 20 Hepatobiliary adverse drug reactions are an important issue in the field of drug safety and pharmacovigilance, as they are the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe [ 21 22 23 24 25 Amoxicillin-induced liver toxicity is not a direct pharmacological effect but primarily immunoallergic. This immune-mediated hypersensitivity leads to injury that can be more commonly cholestatic or less frequently hepatocellular. It has been suggested that Class I and Class II HLA genotypes affect susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-induced hepatic injury, indicating the importance of the adaptive immune response in the pathogenetic mechanism [ 26 27 It has been suggested that pharmacovigilance databases could serve as a tool in measuring antibiotic resistance, with the aim of tracking resistant microorganisms, reducing therapy failures, and, finally, ensuring appropriate prescription of existing antibiotics [ 28 29 30 The combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is prescribed more frequently than amoxicillin in many countries. Amoxicillin alone has fewer side effects and can be prescribed at higher oral doses [ 2 31 32 33 34 35 This can be a problem because the use of amoxicillin and clavulanic in combination is considered to be significantly more effective than that of amoxicillin alone, and therefore, this combination is strongly recommended and regularly prescribed in clinical practice. Based on the evidence of numerous adverse reactions characterized by drug ineffectiveness and considering that not all cases are directly related to resistance, further investigations of this issue are necessary. Investigating potential differences in susceptibility between infectious processes and identifying factors that increase resistance could contribute to improving the rational use of this medicinal product. The results produced with the present study need to be interpreted with care due to the known limitations of pharmacovigilance research using data systems of spontaneous alerts for drugs with known adverse reactions. Limitations include the arbitrary choice of the years analyzed, the lack of a denominator, under-reporting, lower-quality information, causal relationship uncertainty, and, finally, the difficulty in controlling confounding factors such as comorbidities or, sometimes, the dosage and frequency duration of exposure, which may have an influence on health/pathology conditions. Moreover, although care and attention were taken to identify and remove duplicates, they may still exist after data extraction. A different safety profile for the two medicinal products has been previously described. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been associated with a higher risk of Stevens–Johnson syndrome and purpura, as well as with a 9-fold higher average reporting rate for hepatitis than that for amoxicillin alone [ 10 In conclusion, beyond the limitations described above, this research focuses on two aspects related to the safety of prescribing amoxicillin and the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination. The data confirm previous research indicating that prescribing the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination carries an increased risk of hepatobiliary disorders. Moreover, the combination developed to combat amoxicillin resistance appears to be, in many cases, even less effective than amoxicillin itself in combating antibiotic resistance. This observation needs to be handled with caution because the preferred term “drug ineffective” shows indirect proof of antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, the combination amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is often administered as empirical treatment for hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia, while amoxicillin is often chosen for less severe infectious conditions treated at outpatient services [ 2 36 However, despite the limitations outlined above and given the exploratory nature of the disproportionality analysis conducted in this study, which does not allow for a precise quantification of the identified risk, both aspects relating to the safety of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid use and hepatotoxicity on antibiotic resistance deserve further investigation. 4. Materials and Methods EudraVigilance is a database containing suspected adverse reactions (SARs) related to medicines authorized for the European Union (EU) market. SARs are traceable in individual cases (Individual Case Safety Reports; ICSRs) and are signaled by national drug regulatory authorities in the EU or by marketing authorization holders. EudraVigilance collects reports of “suspected” adverse reactions, meaning unwanted medical events observed following medicine use that are not necessarily related to or caused by the medicine itself [ 37 4.1. Design of the Study In the present study, ICSRs reporting SARs that occurred in patients to whom amoxicillin or the combination amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was prescribed, collected from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2024, were collected and analyzed. The public version of the EudraVigilance database was used, and data collection on SARs was conducted according to the following inclusion criteria: serious SARs and reports sent only from healthcare professionals in cases regarding all ages (from 0 to > 85 years) and those reported from the European Economic Area, including the United Kingdom. To evaluate the adverse reaction identified as “Drug ineffective”, all serious and non-serious cases to amoxicillin and to the combination were analyzed. We mention the UK separately because in EudraVigilance, it continues to be included within the EEA. Alerts were excluded from the analysis when they were reported by non-healthcare professionals or came from non-European countries. For all cases, information on patient characteristics (age group and sex), adverse reaction type (often more than one for each ICSR), and the qualification of the primary source was provided. Regarding the criteria for data extraction from ICSRs, SAR selection was based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) [ 38 4.2. Data Analysis The source of data extraction is a line listing a structured table where each row represents an ICSR and each column represents a specific data point associated with that case. The data were analyzed by aggregating the PTs of individual reports to a higher level of the MedDRA hierarchy by merging individual serious SARs in the SOC level (e.g., nausea and vomiting are classified in the same group as “Gastrointestinal symptoms”). Only reports classified as serious were analyzed, except for the analysis of data related to the adverse reaction “Drug ineffective”. In accordance with the E2D guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization, ICSRs are classified as serious if they are life-threatening, have resulted in death, have resulted or prolonged hospitalization or disability, or are related to a congenital anomaly/birth defect or other medically important conditions. The adequate stratification of alerts by sex group was performed to avoid biases caused by confounding effects and to analyze these two variables separately. The sex distribution was analyzed using the chi-square test. Duplicate and incomplete ICSRs were excluded from the analysis. A duplicate search was conducted of the dataset based on similarity in terms of the adverse reaction, age, sex, suspected/interacting medicinal products, and the EudraVigilance local report number. The statistical analyses used were one-way ANOVAs. A disproportionate analysis of the potential association of the SOC group “Hepatobiliary disorders” and of the alert “Drug ineffective” was performed by the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and comparing the SARs of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination with those signaled for amoxicillin alone. Disproportionality analysis was used to compare the proportions or frequencies of two or more groups and to verify whether the differences are statistically significant. It is a methodology used to detect adverse drug reaction alerts. It is based on the two-by-two contingency table. In this way, the differences between the occurrence frequency and the background frequency for target drugs and target adverse events can be compared [ 39 40 41 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, I.A., F.C., C.M. and G.C.; methodology, I.A., F.C., C.M. and M.C.; software, I.A., F.C., M.C., G.C., P.M. and E.E.; validation, I.A. and F.C.; formal analysis, I.A., F.C., P.M. and L.C.; investigation, C.M., P.M., M.C. and L.C.; resources, data curation, E.E., C.M., F.C., P.M. and G.C.; writing—original draft preparation, I.A., F.C., C.M. and L.C.; writing—review and editing, F.C., C.M., L.C. and E.E.; supervision, G.C.; project administration, I.A. and F.C.
