This retrospective study mainly aimed at assessing the effect of intraoperative fibrin glue (FG) spraying on postoperative bleeding in patients with early esthe ophageal cancer (EEC) and early gastric cancer (EGC). Methods A retrospective analysis of FG uses during ESD was conducted in 362 patients with early upper gastrointestinal malignancy. 362 patients who received ESD were divided into the FG group and the conventional group, comparing their postoperative bleeding rate, acute postoperative bleeding rate, and delayed postoperative bleeding rate using stratified analysis and propensity score matching (PSM) to eliminate potential confounding factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were implemented to investigate the risk variables for surgical hemorrhage following early upper gastrointestinal malignancy. Results The results of stratification based on intraoperative bleeding showed that the use of FG in the intraoperative bleeding group of EGC patients undergoing ESD could effectively reduce bleeding within 48 h after surgery ( p p p p Conclusions Intraoperative spraying of FG may help to reduce the incidence of postoperative bleeding after ESD, especially acute postoperative bleeding in patients with EGC.

Introduction Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a sophisticated technique that overcomes the limitations of conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). It offers the benefits of a less invasive procedure and a low postoperative local recurrence rate, which is now a standard treatment for upper gastrointestinal lesions (including esophageal and gastric superficial tumor lesions) [ 1–3 4 5 6 5 7 Fibrin glue (FG) is a tissue adhesive and hemostatic substance, mainly composed of human or bovine blood fibrinogen and thrombin [ 8 8–10 11–13 14 In the prevention of post-ESD bleeding, several critical knowledge gaps remain. Currently, there is minimal data on the utilization of FG independently for decreasing bleeding after ESD, and these studies focus primarily on superficial lesions such as carcinoma, precancerous lesions, and adenomas [ 14 15 2. Methods 2.1. Patient selection This study included patients with early cancer (including esophageal and gastric early cancer) who underwent upper gastrointestinal ESD in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from November 2022 to November 2024, and retrospectively analyzed resources, including clinical records, endoscopic surgery reports or monitoring, and telephone follow-up data. Patients with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and carcinoma confirmed by postoperative pathology were included. The exclusion criteria were: (1) Incomplete clinical data; (2) Remnant stomach; (3) Perforation or partial full-thickness resection during ESD. According to standard guidelines [ 16 17 Patients were separated into two groups: the fibrin glue group (FG group) and the conventional group ( Figure 1 Figure 1. The flowchart of patient enrollment. EGC: early gastric cancer; EEC: early esophageal cancer; ESD: endoscopic submucosal dissection; LGIN: low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. All subjects signed informed consent for ESD, and in the FG group, when the operating doctor decides to use FG during the operation, the legally authorized client of the patient would be notified immediately and signed informed consent for the use of FG. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, with the approval number 2025-338. 2.2. ESD procedure and application of FG In principle, ESD was performed according to standard methods using a therapeutic endoscope (GIF-Q260J; Olympus Medical, Tokyo, Japan) in the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. The steps mentioned below were taken: 1) ring marking 3–5 mm from the lesion border; 2) injecting 0.2% to 0.4% sodium hyaluronate solution or saline submucosally around the lesion in a proximity-to-distance order; 3) cutting the mucosa and removing the submucosal layer with the ESD device; 4) using hemostatic forceps to coagulate the visible blood vessels at the base of the ESD ulcer. All ESD wounds were pre-coagulated by traditional hemostasis methods such as electrocoagulation and hemostatic clips under the judgment of endoscopists when it is necessary. The aforementioned hemostasis techniques will also be used to stop intraoperative bleeding in order to avoid interfering with subsequent steps. For the FG group, FG gel was sprayed after this step to ensure no active bleeding. Subsequently, the post-ESD wounds were uniformly covered with porcine FG (BIOSEAL, Guangzhou Bexiu Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) via Figure 2 Figure 2. Comparison of before and after fibrin glue application during endoscopy. (A). An ESD wound in the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum. (B). When fibrin glue is sprayed after ESD, it is a translucent milky white gel. (C). Another ESD wound in the lesser curvature of the stomach. (D). The gel fully solidified on the ESD wound surface five minutes after the fibrin glue was sprayed. 2.3. Perioperative management and follow-up All included patients exercised preoperative magnifying chromoendoscopy and ultrasound endoscopy. Fasting and water restriction for 8 h before surgery. Fasting for 48 h started after surgery. A standard dose of intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was administered intravenously within 24 h of ESD for 2 days, followed by oral PPI (40 mg, once daily). Gastric ESD was taken orally for 8 weeks, while esophageal ESD was given orally for 4 weeks. Hematemesis, melena, or a drop in hemoglobin of ≥2.0 g/dL is considered postoperative bleeding, and the attending physician will send the patient right away for emergency endoscopic surgery. Prior research has demonstrated that routine secondary endoscopy is not essential for preventing prolonged bleeding following ESD [ 18–21 2.4. Data collection The necessary baseline information was obtained by querying the case and endoscopic procedure systems. Bleeding events were gathered by reviewing case records, emergency endoscopy records, and phone follow-ups. The patient’s gender, age, history of anticoagulant use, history of smoking, information on alcohol consumption, and concomitant diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia) were among the general baseline and clinical characteristics that were gathered. Additionally included were pathologic information like lesion size, location, negative pathologic margins, en bloc resection, and complete resection. In the case of multiple lesions, the maximum diameter of the largest lesion was taken. The location of gastric lesions is categorized into upper (U), middle (M), and lower (L) according to the classification of gastric cancer by the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association [ 22 2.5. Histological evaluation After the procedure, the lesion mucosa was recovered and unfolded, the needle was fixed on a foam plate along the outside of the marking, the proximal and distal ends of the lesion were marked, the maximum diameter of the lesion was measured, the specimen was fixed in 10% formalin solution, and serial sections of the specimen were made at 2 mm intervals. 2.6. Definitions and clinical outcome Delayed bleeding events were defined as the occurrence of hematemesis or melena, a decrease in Hb level >2 g/dL, and bleeding confirmed by endoscopy. The primary outcome measure was the overall bleeding rate (OB) within 4 weeks after ESD. We will concentrate on bleeding events within 48 h after ESD and after 48 h in both groups to better examine the impact of FG on bleeding following ESD, as the number of bleeding events within 24 h after surgery is still appropriate [ 15 23 23 24 2.7. Statistics Normally distributed quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and p t p U p 2 2 Firstly, we compared the baseline of the FG group and routine group with SPSS software and analyzed the postoperative bleeding rate of EGC and EEC in the intraoperative bleeding group and non-intraoperative bleeding group by a stratified method. Secondly, to eliminate bias due to confounding variables, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was utilized, and the FG and conventional groups were matched 1:1, with a matching score difference of less than 0.02. Additionally, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to explore the risk factors associated with delayed bleeding after ESD. We also used a tool to compute statistical power analyses, G Power software (Version 3.1.9.7, Franz Faul, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany) (α = 0.05, a power of 0.90), to calculate and verify that the total sample size had reached the proper statistical level. SPSS software, version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA) and R software (version 4.4.2, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) were used for statistical analysis, and p 3. Results 3.1.

Discussion Delayed postoperative bleeding, the most common complication of gastric ESD, has always drawn a lot of attention, and there is no shortage of studies on it around the world [ 25–28 9 13 15 In this study, a total of 362 patients with early upper gastrointestinal tract cancers including 300 cases of EGC and 62 cases of EEC were enrolled. Four patients who required a three-arm titanium clip and purse-string suture owing to intraoperative perforation or partial full-thickness resection were not enrolled in our EGC patient recruitment for the reason that the extra procedure greatly extended the period of the procedure and possibly had an impact on FG’s capability to prevent post-ESD bleeding episodes [ 5 29 30 In patients with EGC, the bleeding rate following ESD was 25/300 (8.3%), which is consistent with the previous study that the bleeding rate of patients with early gastric cancer after ESD is 4.1%-8.5% [ 7 31 32 33–36 Table 2 4 36 37 After PSM analysis, even based on preventive hemostasis measures, the postoperative bleeding rate of the routine group is 12.7%, which may be as follows: As shown in Table 1 Currently, the methods that have been determined to be effective in preventing delayed bleeding after ESD include continuous use of PPIs after surgery and coagulation or clipping of visible blood vessels in the ulcer [ 38 39 29 40 29 29 41 42 12 15 43 In this study, by forming a retrospective cohort, after comparing the baseline, it was found that in this item of intraoperative bleeding, there was a significant difference between the sprayed group (76.8%) and the conventional group (37.9%) ( p Table 6 15 Table 1 6 Although the original baseline is basically the same, variables including the age, lesion size and lesion depth between the conventional group and the FG group are statistically significant, which has been indicated to be likely linked to post-ESD bleeding by previous reports [ 23 24 44 Table 8 11–13 Table 9 Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to further explore the variables associated with postoperative bleeding after ESD for early upper gastrointestinal cancer. Intraoperative bleeding and negative horizontal and vertical resection margins emerged as significant predictors in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis further confirmed intraoperative bleeding as an independent risk factor, aligning with prior studies suggesting its role in influencing postoperative bleeding following ESD [ 23 24 45 Table 6 46 30 32 46 47 It is worth mentioning that the preoperative use of PPIs was not associated with postoperative bleeding in ESD in our cohort, which may be related to the fact that it was administered by the intravenous route preoperatively and lasted for only 1 day. This null effect may be attributed to the abbreviated therapeutic duration and route of delivery, as evidence suggests that preoperative oral administration of PPIs for 1 week has a greater effect on intraoperative PH, which is beneficial in controlling the occurrence of hemorrhage [ 48–50 9 13 15 Nevertheless, this study has several conspicuous limitations inherent to its retrospective design. First, despite PSM to balance measured confounders like lesion size, and intraoperative bleeding, unmeasured variables such as subtle endoscopic technique variations or transient hemodynamic changes during ESD may have influenced outcomes and produced the bias. Second, the single-center design limits generalizability, as all procedures were performed by skilled endoscopists, potentially underestimating bleeding risks in less experienced settings. Third, the small sample size of esophageal ESD cases precludes definitive conclusions on FG’s efficacy in this subgroup, warranting validation in larger cohorts. While our findings suggest FG reduces acute bleeding in EGC, RCTs are essential to confirm causality and optimize FG application protocols. Future multicenter RCTs should prioritize patients with EGC and standardize FG dosing, spray techniques, and postoperative acid suppression regimens. Additionally, mechanistic studies exploring FG degradation kinetics relative to ulcer healing phases could clarify its time-limited efficacy. 5. Conclusion Fibrin glue sprayed intraoperatively may help reduce bleeding following ESD, particularly in EGC patients who contribute to acute postoperative hemorrhage. In light of its correlation with postoperative bleeding, intraoperative bleeding in ESD should be valued in procedures.
