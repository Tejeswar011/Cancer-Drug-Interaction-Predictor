Although the role of conventional stroke risk factors is well established, the impact of coagulation disorders—both inherited and acquired—on long-term CVD mortality remains underexplored. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using U.S. death certificate data from the CDC WONDER platform (1999–2020). Adults aged ≥ 25 years with CVD as the underlying cause and any coagulation disorder listed as a contributing cause were included. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) were calculated per 100,000 population. Joinpoint regression was used to evaluate temporal trends, estimating Annual Percent Change (APC) and Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) across subgroups. Results Between 1999 and 2020, 54,545 CVD-related deaths occurred among adults with coagulation disorders. The overall AAMR was 1.16, with a significant decline over time (AAPC: − 0.58%, 95% CI: − 0.87 to − 0.28; p Conclusions Although overall CVD mortality declined modestly, widening disparities by sex, race, region, and age group signal critical gaps in prevention and care.

Inherited forms such as hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and von Willebrand disease have traditionally been associated with hemorrhagic complications. However, accumulating evidence shows that individuals with these disorders may also experience thrombotic events, including ischemic stroke, particularly as they age and accumulate vascular comorbidities [ 3 4 5 Pathophysiologic studies have demonstrated that abnormal activation or consumption of clotting factors may contribute to cerebrovascular injury. For example, elevated levels of factor VIII and fibrinogen have been independently associated with increased stroke risk [ 6 7 Despite these insights, long-term national data examining trends in CVD-related mortality among individuals with coagulation disorders are lacking. Most existing studies focus on clinical outcomes within narrow subgroups or investigate stroke risk among patients with specific bleeding disorders, limiting generalizability to broader populations [ 8 To address this need, we conducted a 22-year nationwide analysis of U.S. mortality data, focusing on adults with coexisting cerebrovascular disease and underlying coagulation disorders. By evaluating trends across demographic, geographic, and clinical subgroups, this study provides new insights into a high-risk and understudied population, with implications for risk stratification, health policy, and future research. Methods Study design We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of U.S. mortality data using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) platform [ 9 Deaths were selected using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [ 10 S1 This study relied exclusively on publicly available, de-identified data and was therefore exempt from Institutional Review Board oversight. We followed the STROBE guidelines for reporting observational studies (Supplementary Table S2) [ 11 Data extraction Data were extracted for the total adult population and stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, ten-year age groups (25–34 through ≥ 85), U.S. Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), urbanization level (metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan), state of residence, and place of death. Race and ethnicity were recorded based on information typically provided by next of kin and reported by funeral directors. Urbanization level followed the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Urban–Rural Classification Scheme [ 12 Statistical analysis Annual death counts and population estimates were extracted from CDC WONDER. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) were calculated using the direct method and standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard population. AAMRs were expressed per 100,000 population, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using Poisson distribution assumptions. Temporal trends were assessed using Joinpoint regression, applying log-linear models to estimate Annual Percent Change (APC) for each identified segment and Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) across the full study period. The Joinpoint Regression Program (version 5.0.2) from the National Cancer Institute was used to perform the analysis [ 13 14 The number and location of joinpoints were selected empirically based on best model fit. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Subgroup-specific models were fit separately for sex, race/ethnicity, age group, geographic region, urbanization level, and state of residence. For each segment, APCs and corresponding 95% CIs were reported. Tests of parallelism were used to assess whether trends differed significantly across subgroups. All supplementary analyses and visualizations were conducted in Python (v3.11) using the statsmodels, scipy, and matplotlib libraries. Complete Joinpoint regression outputs (segment years, APCs with 95% CIs and p-values, and AAPCs) are provided in (Supplementary Tables S3–S7). Results Overall trends From 1999 to 2020, there were 54,545 cerebrovascular disease (CVD)–related deaths recorded among U.S. adults with documented coagulation disorders. The overall age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) was 1.16 per 100,000 (95% CI, 1.13–1.19) (Table 1 p p p p 2 1  Fig. 1 Trends in cerebrovascular disease–related mortality with coagulation disorders

Small proportions were dead on arrival (0.10%) or had an unknown place of death (0.10%) (Table 1 Discussion In this national analysis from 1999 to 2020, we identified 54,545 cerebrovascular disease (CVD)–related deaths among adults with coagulation disorders in the United States. The overall age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) was 1.16 per 100,000 population, with a modest but statistically significant decline over time (AAPC: − 0.58%, 95% CI: − 0.87 to − 0.28; p Sex-based disparities were persistent. Men had higher mortality than women (AAMR: 1.35 vs. 1.01), though both groups improved. The sharper decline in females (AAPC: − 0.96% vs. − 0.32%) may reflect stronger engagement with preventive care and primary care access among women [ 15 17 18 19 20 23 21 24 Geographic disparities revealed further complexity. The West had the highest overall AAMR (1.30 per 100,000), while the Northeast had the lowest (1.02 per 100,000) and the only significant mortality decline (AAPC: − 0.90%, p p 25 26 27 p 28 29 Older adults bore the greatest mortality burden in our cohort, with rates rising steeply across advancing age groups. This age gradient mirrors national stroke patterns in the general population, where risk and mortality accelerate with age [ 30 31 15 30 32 These disparities are compounded by the biological complexity of coagulation disorders. Individuals with hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are predisposed to hemorrhagic stroke, while those with prothrombotic states—such as antiphospholipid syndrome or malignancy-associated coagulopathy—face heightened ischemic risk [ 33 35 36 Despite therapeutic advances—including recombinant clotting factors, refined transfusion protocols, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)—outcomes remain poor [ 32 37 38 39 40 While national stroke mortality has declined due to improved hypertension control, smoking cessation, and thrombolytic therapy [ 30 31 41 42 39 43 44 Beyond being the first nationwide study to specifically evaluate cerebrovascular disease mortality in individuals with coagulation disorders, our findings provide important insights into the intersection of vascular and hematologic risk. Even modest declines or differences in mortality carry clinical and public health significance in a vulnerable population with dual risks of bleeding and thrombosis. By identifying persistent subgroup disparities by sex, race/ethnicity, region, and urbanizationthese results point to structural and biological gaps in prevention and acute care that may blunt population-level gains in stroke outcomes [ 18 30 38 43 45 Strengths and limitations This study offers a comprehensive national assessment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD)–related mortality among adults with coagulation disorders over a 22-year period, using robust data from the CDC WONDER platform. Among its key strengths is the large sample size and population-based design, which enhances generalizability and allows for granular stratification by sex, race/ethnicity, urbanization, region, age group, and place of death. The application of Joinpoint regression enabled the identification of meaningful inflection points in mortality trends, which adds important temporal context to evolving patterns. Furthermore, by focusing on a high-risk and understudied population, this study fills a significant gap in the literature and offers new insights into the intersection of hematologic and vascular disease burden in the U.S. Despite these strengths, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the analysis relied on death certificate data, which may be prone to misclassification or underreporting—especially for secondary diagnoses like coagulation disorders [ 46 Conclusion Between 1999 and 2020, cerebrovascular disease–related mortality among adults with coagulation disorders declined modestly, yet the trend was uneven across key subgroups. Higher mortality persisted among men, Black and American Indian populations, rural residents, and older adults. In recent years, the overall gains have plateaued or reversed in several groups, signaling emerging gaps in prevention and treatment. These findings highlight the need for more tailored stroke care strategies in individuals with coagulation disorders, especially those at the intersection of social and biological vulnerability. Strengthening access to timely diagnosis, evidence-based interventions, and equitable care delivery will be critical to reducing preventable deaths in this high-risk population.
