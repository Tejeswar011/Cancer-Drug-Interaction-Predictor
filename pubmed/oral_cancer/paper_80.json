In 2020, approximately 1.089 million new cases and 769,000 deaths were reported globally, with gastric cancer ranking fifth in incidence and fourth in cancer-related mortality worldwide ( 1 2 3 The enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concept has gained increasing prominence among clinicians in recent years. ERAS emphasizes the application of evidence-based perioperative strategies aimed at reducing surgical stress, minimizing complications, accelerating recovery, and shortening hospital stay ( 4 6 7 8 9 The thumbtack needle technique, a form of superficial acupuncture, involves embedding a small needle under the skin at specific acupoints to provide continuous stimulation. This sustained input is believed to regulate the functions of meridians, internal organs, and Qi blood (i.e., microcirculatory and neuromodulatory dynamics) ( 10 11 12 15 16 18 In this study, thumbtack needles were bilaterally placed at Neiguan (PC6), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Hegu (LI4), and Sanyinjiao (SP6) to provide continuous stimulation of key acupoints and promote GI recovery via cutaneous-visceral reflex pathways ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Schematic illustration of thumbtack needle therapy for improving GI function recovery through continuous stimulation of acupoints: Neiguan (PC6), Hegu (LI4), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), and Sanyinjiao (SP6).

The trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University and was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2400084712). All eligible participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline. Participants included gastric cancer patients who were scheduled to undergo laparoscopic surgery at the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University from June 2024 to February 2025. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age 18–70 years, regardless of gender; (2) histologically confirmed gastric cancer based on gastroscopy and pathological examination; (3) scheduled for laparoscopic radical gastrectomy; and (4) voluntary participation with signed informed consent. The exclusion criteria included (1) known metal allergy or significant needle phobia; (2) surgical incisions or scarring in the meridian areas corresponding to Neiguan (PC6), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Hegu (LI4), or Sanyinjiao (SP6); (3) local skin infections at the aforementioned acupoints; (4) inability to comprehend or complete the visual analog scale (VAS), numeric rating scale (NRS), or gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS); (5) conversion to open surgery; (6) occurrence of serious adverse events (AEs); and (7) judged by investigators to be unsuitable for participation. The patient enrollment flowchart is presented in Figure 2 Figure 2 Patient enrollment flowchart. Flowchart of a clinical trial process. Starts with 103 participants assessed for eligibility; 23 excluded for reasons including allergies and inability to complete assessments. Eighty were randomized into treatment (40 participants) and control (40 participants) groups. Both groups had full participation with no loss to follow-up. All 80 participants were included in the final analysis. 2.1 Intervention All patients underwent laparoscopic resection of gastric cancer. Specifically, all surgeries were performed using 3D laparoscopic techniques and included distal, proximal, or total gastrectomy depending on the tumor location and clinical staging. A standardized D2 lymphadenectomy combined with complete mesogastrium excision was performed in all cases. 2.1.1 ERAS perioperative management All participants received ERAS perioperative management ( 19 21 1. Preoperative period • Preoperative education: On the day of admission, patients were educated on the components and anticipated benefits of ERAS-based perioperative management to ensure their understanding and cooperation, as well as that of their families. • Nutritional risk assessment: For patients with nutritional risk (NRS2002 ≥ 3 points), enteral or parenteral nutrition is provided based on whether the patient is fasting. • Bowel preparation: Mechanical bowel preparation was not performed. • Fasting: Patients were instructed to fast from solid food for 6 h and from clear liquids for 2 h before surgery. • Perioperative prophylactic antithrombotic therapy: The Caprini thrombosis risk assessment scale was used to evaluate the risk of venous thromboembolism at admission. • Prophylactic antibiotic use: Antibiotics were administered 30 min before surgery. 2. Intraoperative period • Anesthesia management: General and intravenous combined anesthesia. • Temperature management: Intraoperative body temperature was monitored. Warm distilled water was used for peritoneal lavage, and a warming blower was applied to maintain normothermia during surgery. • Fluid management: No fluid restriction. • Intra-abdominal drains management: Selectively placed based on the patient’s intraoperative surgical condition, and removed early, within 1–2 postoperative days. • Nasogastric tube management: Inserted intraoperatively and removed within 24 h postoperatively if the anastomosis was deemed satisfactory. • Urinary catheter management: Inserted intraoperatively and removed early, within 1–2 postoperative days. 3. Postoperative period • Pain management: Adequate postoperative analgesia was provided using a multimodal analgesic strategy, including low-dose opioids combined with NSAIDs, along with patient-controlled intravenous analgesia. • Prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting: 5-HT₃ receptor antagonists were administered intravenously. • Dietary guidance: Except in patients with impaired intestinal function, anastomotic leakage, bowel obstruction, or high risk of gastroparesis, we initiate orally ingested nutritional support within 24 h after surgery. • Mobilization out of bed 24 h after surgery. • Fluid management: A goal-directed fluid therapy approach, which aims to maintain appropriate tissue perfusion and organ function while avoiding both hypovolemia-related complications and volume overload. 2.1.2 Acupuncture procedures Patients in the treatment group received thumbtack needle therapy using disposable, sterile needles ( Φ Figure S1 and Table S1 Supplementary Material 22 Before application, the skin at the acupoint sites was disinfected using 75% alcohol. A disposable thumbtack needle was then applied to each acupoint with vertical pressure using the thumb or index finger, starting gently and increasing until a tingling sensation (deqi) was achieved. Each session involved stimulating each acupoint for 1 min, repeated every 4 h. The treatment was administered once daily, beginning 2 days prior to surgery and continuing until 3 days after surgery. 2.2 Outcomes The primary outcomes were the time to bowel sound recovery and time to first flatus, both measured in hours. The secondary outcomes included the time to first defecation, time to removal of nasogastric tube and intra-abdominal drains (measured in hours), postoperative pain score (assessed using the NRS), postoperative nausea and vomiting score (assessed using the VAS), postoperative abdominal distention score (assessed using the GSRS), postoperative hospital stay, incidence of postoperative complications, safety evaluation, and overall response rate. The overall response rate was assessed 72 h postoperatively, based on the Rome IV criteria. It was defined as the sum of patients achieving complete response, marked response, or moderate response. Postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting score, and abdominal distention scores were recorded at three time points: POD 1, POD 2, and POD 3. Patients self-evaluated their symptoms using the corresponding validated numerical scales. Detailed definitions and assessment criteria for both primary and secondary outcomes are presented in Table S2 Supplementary Material 2.3 Sample size In this study, the expected difference between the treatment and control groups was estimated based on a previous study ( 23 α β Z Z α /2 Z β n = ( Z α / 2 + Z β ) 2 ⋅ ( σ 1 2 + σ 2 2 ) 2 / δ 2 N 2.4 Randomization and blinding Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or control group in a 1:1 ratio using SPSS version 26.0 to generate the randomization sequence. The allocation results were placed sequentially into sealed, opaque envelopes, which were prepared and managed by the individual who generated the randomization sequence . The researcher who generated the randomization sequence was not involved in participant enrollment or group assignment. Furthermore, the individual responsible for generating and maintaining the randomization list was not involved in any other aspect of the study. 2.5 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 and R 4.1.0 software. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the characteristics of patients in each group. For continuous variables, normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Data conforming to a normal distribution were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and between-group comparisons were conducted using the independent samples t U χ 2 post-hoc test P 3 Results 3.1 Baseline patient characteristics A total of 103 participants were screened for eligibility.

First flatus provides objective evidence of resumed intestinal transit, suggesting that mechanical obstruction has resolved and preliminary digestive function has returned. These two primary outcomes together offer a comprehensive assessment of GI function recovery.

Removal of the nasogastric tube enables patients to gradually resume oral intake, which in turn stimulates GI hormone secretion and establishes a positive feedback loop that promotes GI functional recovery. Following the removal of the intra-abdominal drains, early ambulation becomes feasible, further stimulating intestinal peristalsis and accelerating postoperative GI recovery. As shown in Figure 4 Table 2 P = P = P = Figure 4 Comparison of the postoperative time to first defecation and time to removal of nasogastric tube and intra-abdominal drains between the treatment and control groups. Data are expressed as the median (IQR) ( n P Box plot comparing postoperative times for treatment and control groups in three categories: first defecation, nasogastric tube removal, and intra-abdominal drains removal. Each category shows statistically significant differences, with treatment generally taking less time than control. Pink represents treatment and blue represents control. Dots, triangles, and diamonds represent individual data points. 3.3.2 Postoperative pain score Postoperative pain is a key parameter in evaluating the effectiveness of perioperative management. In laparoscopic surgery, the use of carbon dioxide to establish pneumoperitoneum may irritate the peritoneal nerves and contribute to postoperative pain. In this study, pain levels were assessed using the NRS. As shown in Table 2 Figure 5 P = P P = Figure 5 Comparison of the pre- and postoperative pain scores between the treatment and control groups. Data are expressed as the median (IQR) ( n P P Box plot compares postoperative pain scores (NRS) between treatment (pink) and control (blue) groups over preoperative day 2 and postoperative days 1 to 3. Significant differences are noted on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3, indicated by asterisks. No significant difference is observed on preoperative day 2. Furthermore, the Scheirer–Ray–Hare test revealed a significant main effect of group ( H P H P H P = Table S3 Supplementary Material 3.3.3 Postoperative nausea and vomiting score Postoperative nausea and vomiting are commonly triggered by the surgical trauma, which can induce systemic dysregulation of neuromodulatory networks. In particular, sympathovagal imbalance disrupts neurohumoral control of GI function and gastroduodenal coordination. In this study, nausea and vomiting were assessed using the VAS. As shown in Table 2 Figure 6 P = P = P Figure 6 Comparison of the pre- and postoperative nausea and vomiting scores between the treatment and control groups.

Data are expressed as the mean (SD) ( n P Box plot comparing postoperative hospital days between treatment and control groups. The treatment group (pink) has a median of around 10 days, while the control group (blue) has a median closer to 15 days, indicating shorter stays in the treatment group. An asterisk suggests statistical significance. 3.3.6 Postoperative complications Among the 80 participants included in the study, six cases of postoperative complications were reported. In the treatment group, two patients (5.0%) experienced complications (both were pulmonary infections), while in the control group, four patients (10.0%) developed complications (all pulmonary infections). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups (difference, −5.0%, 95% CI: −18.6 to 8.0, P = Table 2 3.3.7 Safety evaluation No treatment-related adverse events were observed in the treatment group, indicating that thumbtack needle therapy was safe and well-tolerated. 3.3.8 Overall response rate The overall response rate in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in the control group (difference, 17.5%, 95% CI: 0.2 to 34.0, P = Table 2 Figure 9 Figure 9 Comparison of the overall response rate between the treatment and control groups. The overall response rate was defined as the sum of complete, marked, and moderate responses according to the Rome IV criteria. Two pie charts compare treatment and control groups by response rate.

In the control group: complete response 2.5%, marked response 7.5%, moderate response 62.5%, no response 27.5%. 4 Discussion PGD remains a common and challenging complication after gastric cancer surgery. Currently, modern medicine lacks specific treatments for PGD, with management largely relying on prokinetic agents. However, prolonged or high-dose use of these medications may lead to adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, fatigue, drowsiness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, rash, and dizziness. Although ERAS protocols have improved overall perioperative recovery, they remain insufficient in shortening the duration of early postoperative ileus ( 21 24 In recent years, the integration of acupuncture into ERAS pathways has gained momentum, particularly in GI surgeries. Acupuncture has been reported to preserve intestinal mucosal barrier integrity, alleviate postoperative pain, and reduce the need for anesthetics. According to modern medical theories, PGD is triggered by surgical trauma, initiating a cascade of physiological disruptions: localized ischemia–reperfusion injury, impaired microcirculatory perfusion, systemic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These changes undermine cellular energy metabolism, while sympathetic overactivity suppresses vagal tone, leading to sphincter dyssynergia and motility failure. This dysfunction promotes small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and mucosal barrier breakdown, facilitating endotoxin translocation and perpetuating a cycle of GI paralysis and systemic inflammation ( 25 Acupuncture exerts therapeutic effects by enhancing vagal tone and mitigating neurogenic inflammation, thus addressing both the neural and immune dysregulation underlying PGD. This aligns with traditional Chinese medicine principles, where the unimpeded flow of Qi is considered foundational to functional recovery ( 23 In this study, we selected five classical acupoints: Neiguan (PC6), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Hegu (LI4), and Sanyinjiao (SP6) ( 22 26 • Neiguan is a key point for regulating the triple energizer (San Jiao) and is widely used to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting. • Zusanli, the lower He-sea point of the stomach, harmonizes the spleen and stomach, regulates Qi, and is a primary point for GI disorders. • Shangjuxu, the lower He-sea point of the large intestine, promotes intestinal peristalsis and relieves food retention. • Hegu, regulates stomach Qi and alleviates retching and epigastric discomfort. • Sanyinjiao, belonging to the spleen meridian, nourishes Yin, harmonizes the stomach, and improves intestinal motility. The continuous and stable subcutaneous stimulation provided by thumbtack needles enables sustained activation of meridians, ultimately contributing to the restoration of visceral functional homeostasis. Compared with traditional filiform needle acupuncture, thumbtack needle embedding offers several advantages: it is convenient, safe, is minimally invasive, and allows patients to remain mobile. Patients can apply gentle pressure to the embedded needles on their own, independent of fixed treatment schedules. This approach compensates for the short duration of conventional acupuncture sessions while avoiding the discomfort often associated with filiform needle insertion ( 26 In acupuncture clinical trials, two main types of control interventions are commonly employed: non-insertion and needle-insertion sham controls. These are designed to maintain patient blinding and minimize non-specific effects associated with psychological or placebo responses, thereby allowing for a more accurate evaluation of the specific therapeutic effects attributable to needle insertion. Non-insertion sham controls aim to completely eliminate the physiological effects of acupuncture; however, they are difficult to implement effectively. Because the skin is not penetrated, patients can often distinguish the intervention, compromising blinding. In addition, even light skin contact can induce sensory stimulation and physiological responses, potentially confounding the results. Consequently, all forms of sham acupuncture may inadvertently elicit somatosensory and biological effects, which can influence study outcomes and reduce the contrast between groups ( 27 29 This study demonstrated that the treatment group experienced significantly earlier recovery in several key indicators of GI function, including time to bowel sound recovery, first flatus, first defecation, and removal of both nasogastric tube and intra-abdominal drains, compared with the control group. These findings suggest that thumbtack needle therapy applied to the selected acupoints can effectively facilitate early GI functional recovery following laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer. In addition, the evaluation of postoperative GI symptoms provided valuable clinical insight. Using symptom scores recorded on POD 1–3, we compared abdominal pain, distention, nausea, and vomiting between the two groups. The treatment group consistently showed lower symptom scores across all time points, indicating that thumbtack needle therapy not only accelerates physiological recovery but also significantly alleviates common postoperative GI symptoms associated with laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery. We also compared the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups. The results revealed no significant differences in the occurrence of complications such as postoperative bleeding, infection, and anastomotic leakage. These findings suggest that thumbtack needle therapy does not increase the risk of postoperative complications. Furthermore, no adverse reactions such as syncope, needle retention, or needle breakage were reported among participants. No serious adverse events occurred throughout the study, indicating that thumbtack needle therapy is a safe intervention in the postoperative setting. Moreover, clinical efficacy was assessed using the internationally recognized Rome IV criteria (2016). The results showed that the overall response rate was significantly higher in the treatment group than that in the control group. In addition, the treatment group had a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay compared with the control group. Our study also has several limitations. First, it lacked objective and quantitative outcome measures, and no pre- and postoperative biochemical indicators were collected for comparison. Second, the mechanisms by which the thumbtack needle promotes early GI function recovery after laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery were not explored. Third, the study included only 80 participants and was conducted at a single center, which may introduce potential biases and limit the generalizability of the findings. However, compared with multicenter studies, single-center trials allow for better quality control and ensure greater internal validity. These limitations should be addressed in future multicenter, larger-scale studies incorporating objective biomarkers and mechanistic investigations. 5 Conclusion The results of this study indicate that thumbtack needle therapy applied to bilateral Neiguan (PC6), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Hegu (LI4), and Sanyinjiao (SP6) is a safe and effective intervention for promoting early GI recovery following laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. This approach significantly shortens the time to postoperative bowel sound recovery, first flatus, first defecation, and the removal of nasogastric tube and intra-abdominal drains. In addition, it demonstrates superior efficacy over conventional care in alleviating postoperative symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and distention. The therapy also contributes to reduced hospital stay and yields a significantly higher overall response rate, supporting its clinical value as a complementary treatment within ERAS protocols.
