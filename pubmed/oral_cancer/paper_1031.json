Introduction Air pollution (AP)-related mortality occurs primarily due to cardiorespiratory diseases. A study conducted across 652 cities found that exposure to air pollution was associated with a 0.36% increase in daily cardiovascular mortality and a 0.47% increase in respiratory mortality, especially among adults aged 35 to 70 years. These outcomes may be linked to the potential of AP exposure to alter the human respiratory microbiome, increasing susceptibility to viral infections [ 1 2 The high pollution levels observed in urban areas are mainly attributable to the increasing number of motor vehicles over the past three decades in major cities [ 3 4 3 4 5 5 10 2.5 1 Inhalation of PM and other pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 3 3 6 7 On another front, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that as of December 2020, cardiovascular diseases and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were the leading causes of death and disability globally. These are largely attributable to high levels of physical inactivity and unhealthy lifestyles, in addition to genetic factors [ 8 9 10 11 In response, the WHO has called for increased global efforts in the prevention and management of NCDs, promoting PA as a key preventive strategy [ 8 9 12 However, when considering both the health risks posed by AP and the WHO’s recommendations for promoting PA, concerns arise regarding the potential respiratory effects of outdoor exercise in polluted environments. During PA, ventilation increases, potentially allowing a greater volume of pollutants to enter the respiratory system [ 2 7 11 13 14 A preliminary search in Google Scholar and PubMed identified studies examining the relationship between AP and respiratory diseases, such as asthma [ 15 16 17 18 19 Therefore, this review focuses specifically on the respiratory responses of healthy adults who regularly perform outdoor PA in urban environments under AP exposure. Thus, this scoping review aims to map the physiological, morphological, and/or functional responses of the respiratory system to AP in healthy adults engaging in outdoor exercise in urban environments, as reported in scientific literature. As a secondary objective, this review also seeks to identify any reported responses in other organ systems resulting from the same exposure. 2. Methodology A literature review was conducted on scientific articles published in English and Spanish between 2004 and 2024 in indexed journals. To ensure the most accurate information possible, studies from any country were included if they employed cross-sectional designs, clinical trials, quasi-experimental or experimental studies, case reports, or case-control studies. Gray literature and blog sources were excluded. To enhance sample homogeneity and strengthen the validity of the conclusions, studies were included if participants were healthy adults over 18 years of age who regularly engaged in physical activity and/or outdoor exercise in urban environments—at least three times per week—across any exercise modality (e.g., walking, jogging, running, calisthenics, cycling, etc.). As previously established, due to the distinct physiological characteristics of elite athletes and the greater variability associated with occupational exposure, studies were excluded if participants were professional or elite athletes or if their physical activity was limited to occupational or routine daily tasks. Additionally, studies involving participants diagnosed with respiratory diseases due to occupational exposure to chemicals, exposure to biomass or other biological contaminants, or genetic conditions were excluded. Included studies had to report morphological or physiological findings related to the respiratory system, pulmonary function, and/or respiratory conditions diagnosed through clinical or diagnostic tests or reported by researchers using participant questionnaires. These findings had to be measured after outdoor PA following short-, medium-, or long-term exposure to AP. Studies involving animal models or computer simulations were excluded. This review was conducted following the methodology outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [ 20 21 22 23 24 Table S1 in the Supplementary Material After conducting the search, duplicates were removed using the Rayyan online platform. Once duplicates were eliminated, two reviewers independently and blindly screened the titles and abstracts using Rayyan, based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. To assess study quality, each reviewer independently and blindly applied the appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for the study designs [ 25 Tables S2–S4 in the Supplementary Material Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through consensus. The overall selection process is summarized in Figure 1 Data extraction was carried out using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, where information such as publication, authors, study design, population characteristics, pollutants analyzed, methods for evaluating the respiratory system, and main findings were recorded. After evaluating the initial design of the extraction matrix, additional fields were included for the study objectives and the methods used to measure air pollution to facilitate interpretation and analysis. If the method used to assess any respiratory system variable was unclear, the findings related to that variable were excluded. For the analysis of results, studies were initially grouped by study design. However, the synthesis of findings was later organized according to the types of respiratory responses reported. 3. Results The aim of this scoping review was to map the available evidence regarding the physiological, morphological, and/or functional responses of the respiratory system to AP in healthy adults who engage in outdoor physical exercise in urban environments. After completing the identification and screening process, a total of eight (8) studies were included. All studies were conducted in outdoor urban environments, where physical activities such as walking, running, or cycling were performed, often during peak traffic hours in areas with high levels of AP. Except for one study, in which the participants were older adults over the age of 60 [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Table 1 The most frequently reported pollutants were PM 2.5 26 27 28 29 31 32 10 26 27 28 29 30 31 2 3 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Table S5 in the Supplementary Material 27 26 The most reported outcomes were changes in lung function, assessed by spirometry, particularly in forced vital capacity (FVC) [ 26 27 28 30 31 26 27 28 30 31 32 30 31 32 Table 2 Studies by Matt et al. [ 27 28 2.5 According to Matt et al. [ 27 2.5 3 p 3 p 28 2.5 27 28 Conversely, findings by Sinharay et al. [ 26 In addition to functional respiratory outcomes, inflammatory biomarkers were also reported as indicators of physiological response to AP. Pagani et al. [ 29 33 2 3 33 29 p 2.5 4. Discussion The primary objective of this scoping review was to map the existing evidence regarding the respiratory system responses in healthy adults who engage in outdoor PA in urban environments exposed to AP. To that end, we analyzed morphological, physiological, and functional outcomes reported in literature. While ethical concerns and challenges in controlling multiple variables limited the number of studies investigating the effects of AP exposure during exercise [ 2 34 3 2.5 3 10 Exercise induces physiological changes such as increased ventilation, airflow, a switch from nasal to oral breathing, and altered pulmonary diffusion, all of which facilitate the transport of a greater volume of pollutants to the deeper airways, increasing health risks [ 10 35 36 10 2.5 3 37 38 Nevertheless, the evidence on pulmonary function decline remains inconclusive. Some authors emphasize the lack of significant changes in FEV1 and FVC in healthy adults and suggest that regular aerobic exercise—though frequency, duration, and intensity are often not specified—could mitigate, reverse, or buffer the adverse effects of AP on the respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic systems [ 2 11 39 14 39 26 1 27 Regarding physiological responses, inhalation of O 3 2 33 3 40 41 Furthermore, studies indicate that regular exercisers may show increased FeNO levels only when exposed to high concentrations of AP [ 11 2 34 Pagani et al. [ 29 2.5 10 2.5 3 1 As for morphological changes, no human studies directly investigating structural changes were identified in this review. However, animal models and computational simulations provided useful insights. In laboratory mice, airway permeability was found to be altered during exercise in polluted environments, suppressing both pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses [ 2 11 2.5 39 Secondary cardiovascular responses must also be considered. Several studies suggest that exercising in polluted outdoor environments may reduce the cardioprotective benefits of physical activity through mechanisms such as pulmonary inflammation, increased blood pressure, and particulate deposition in the lungs [ 11 42 43 2.5 14 44 45 33 3 29 2.5 Therefore, while physical activity is widely beneficial, practicing it in heavily polluted urban areas may pose risks if not accompanied by mitigation strategies—such as selecting cleaner routes, training during low-pollution hours, or using personal air quality monitors. Public health policies should incorporate these considerations, acknowledging environmental pollution as a key determinant of health. Taken together, these findings suggest that AP-induced changes in the respiratory system may pose a risk factor for individuals engaging in outdoor exercise, potentially discouraging participation in recreational or sporting activities [ 35 46 34 This review encountered some limitations. Most studies included aerobic exercise interventions, but few specified the intensity of activity, preventing conclusive associations between PA characteristics and the respiratory responses observed. Additionally, inconsistencies in how AP levels were defined posed a challenge. Many studies used different thresholds to define “high pollution” and did not consistently compare their measurements with WHO standards, limiting the ability to assess statistical significance across findings. For future research, we recommend that studies evaluating the health effects of outdoor exercise in polluted environments include precise descriptions of the exercise regimen—including intensity, duration, and modality—alongside pollution levels measured against WHO safety thresholds. This aligns with recommendations by Qin et al. [ 39 We recommend that future studies explore the long-term use of public spaces for physical activity, as current evidence on chronic respiratory responses to repeated exposure remains limited. Such research could enhance our understanding of cumulative health effects and inform the development of more effective public health interventions. Notably, substantial heterogeneity in study designs—including cross-sectional, crossover, and quasi-experimental methods—limits the comparability of findings and should be addressed in future research. Moreover, the lack of longitudinal studies and investigations into morphological changes in humans represents a significant gap in the existing evidence base. A key limitation of this review is that most included studies were conducted in high-income countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. These studies typically involve homogeneous populations—healthy young adults with access to suitable urban environments for physical activity—which limits the generalizability of findings to other settings. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), physical activity is often a necessity rather than recreational choices, such as walking or cycling for transport—frequently under high pollution exposure, with limited infrastructure and greater social vulnerability. More context-specific research in LMICs is urgently needed, using representative and culturally sensitive designs to better understand this interaction and inform inclusive, equitable public health policies. A final limitation worth highlighting is that in studies where air quality measurement methods were not clearly specified, it was assumed that data were obtained from nearby local environmental monitoring stations. Although this assumption aligns with common practice in similar studies, we acknowledge that such inferences may introduce interpretative bias—particularly if the calibration, frequency, or reliability of the monitoring stations was not verified or reported. This methodological limitation could affect the accuracy of reported associations between exposure and physiological response, as pollutant concentrations may vary depending on distance, local meteorological conditions, or station type. Future studies are encouraged to clearly specify their environmental measurement methods to strengthen the internal validity of their findings. In conclusion, individuals who frequently engage in outdoor PA in urban environments with high levels of AP—specifically PM 2.5 10 3 2 Despite the presence of AP in urban outdoor settings, PA continues to offer clear health benefits for the prevention and management of NCDs. Literature suggests a potential protective effect of regular exercise, even in polluted environments, that may offset some of the negative respiratory outcomes associated with AP exposure.
