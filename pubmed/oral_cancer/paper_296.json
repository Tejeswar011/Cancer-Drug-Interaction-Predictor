We report a patient with CD who developed a complex fistula and retroperitoneal abscess that were treated using single-incision laparoscopic surgery. CASE PRESENTATION A 34-year-old man presented to the hospital after collapsing and losing consciousness while at work. Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 20000/μL and severe anemia. Abdominal CT showed a right retroperitoneal abscess, which was drained under CT guidance. After gastrointestinal bleeding and an anal fistula were observed, CD was suspected and confirmed by total colonoscopy. The patient was eventually discharged but readmitted 2 months later for abscess recurrence and a colocutaneous fistula. Once the inflammation had improved after 3 weeks of fasting and intravenous antibiotics, the patient underwent single-incision laparoscopic subtotal colectomy, duodenal fistula closure, and seton drainage. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic subtotal colectomy can be performed safely to treat CD-related abscesses and complicated fistulas after inflammation has improved.

Blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 20000/μL and severe anemia. His medical and family histories were unremarkable. Abdominal CT revealed a right retroperitoneal abscess, and he was admitted and underwent CT-guided abscess drainage. Gastrointestinal bleeding and a complicated anal fistula were observed during hospitalization. CD was suspected and confirmed after sigmoid colonoscopy revealed mild stenosis, cobblestone appearance, and a rectal ulcer. He was discharged from the hospital 2 months after admission. During a follow-up outpatient visit, an ascending colon-cutaneous fistula and pus draining from the right side of the abdomen were noted on examination. The patient was then admitted to the hospital, where contrast-enhanced CT showed an abscess around the ilium extending to the right iliopsoas, and recurrence of the retroperitoneal abscess ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 CT findings at admission. The image shows an abscess extending from near the right ilium to the iliopsoas muscle, with recurrence of the previous right retroperitoneal abscess. The circled area indicates the abscess cavity. The patient was then fasted and treated with intravenous cefmetazole 3g daily. After the inflammation had improved, total colonoscopy was performed, which showed a complicated anal fistula, mild rectal stenosis, and severe stenosis in the ascending colon, which was difficult to traverse with the colonoscope. A longitudinal ulcer was observed from the transverse colon to the ascending colon. A selective contrast examination was performed from the ascending colon using a water-soluble contrast medium, which showed contrast leaking from the ascending colon into the cutaneous fistula ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Contrast total colonoscopy examination at admission. The procedure was performed from the ascending colon using a water-soluble contrast medium, which leaked from the ascending colon into the cutaneous fistula. The site of contrast medium leakage into the cutaneous fistula is indicated by the blue arrows. After 3 weeks of fasting and antibiotics, the patient’s abdominal symptoms had improved, and repeat contrast-enhanced CT showed a marked reduction in the size of the abscess cavity. Contrast enema examination showed marked shortening from the cecum to the descending colon as well as stenosis in the ileocecal region; no contrast leaked from the ascending colon into the cutaneous fistula ( Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Fig. 3 Enema examination just before surgery. There was marked shortening from the cecum to the descending colon, and stenosis was observed in the ileocecal region, with no leakage of contrast medium from the ascending colon into the cutaneous fistula. The blue arrow indicates stenosis in the ileocecal region. Fig. 4 Small intestine contrast examination just before surgery. The image shows a suspected fistula between the duodenum and ascending colon. The blue arrow indicates the duodenum, and the red arrowheads indicate the suspected fistula. As surgical treatment, the patient underwent single-incision laparoscopic subtotal colectomy, ileosigmoid anastomosis, and seton drainage. A 4-cm skin incision was made in the umbilical region, a Lap protector and EZ access 100 mm (Hakko, Nagano, Japan) were placed, and one 12-mm camera port and two 5-mm ports were inserted in the same region for surgery ( Fig. 5 Fig. 6 Fig. 7 Fig. 5 Single-incision laparoscopic surgery. A 4-cm skin incision was made in the umbilical region, and single-incision laparoscopic surgery began with one 12-mm camera port and two 5-mm ports. Fig. 6 Operative findings showing a fistula between the duodenum and ascending colon. A fistula between the duodenum and ascending colon was identified. The ascending colon is indicated with a yellow arrow, duodenum with a blue arrow, and duodenal fistula with red arrowheads. Fig. 7 Dissection of the retroperitoneal abscess. Inflammation had improved with treatment, and ileocecal mobilization was relatively easy to perform. The ascending colon is indicated by the yellow arrow, and the abscess cavity is indicated by the red arrowheads. The mesentery was dissected outside the body cavity. The intestinal tract was resected on the oral side at the end of the ileum and on the anal side at the sigmoid colon in a region without lesions. Then, end-to-side ileosigmoid anastomosis was performed using the Albert–Lembert suture technique. The duodenal fistula was closed simply in 2 layers by trimming the fistula. After the abdominal operation was completed, the anal fistula was treated using 5-site seton drainage. The operation time was 4h and 29 min, and the blood loss was 20 mL. Pathological findings showed marked lymphocytic infiltration in the mucosa from the ileocecal region to the descending colon, with scattered foci extending into the muscularis propria and subserosa. In the subserosa of the ileocecal region, foreign material suspected to be food residue was surrounded by atypical multinucleated giant cells, consistent with peritonitis due to perforation. Mucosal tissue was also found within the muscularis layer of the ascending colon, suggesting diverticula or fistula formation, which may have contributed to the perforation. On POD 4, a nasogastric tube was placed because of vomiting and paralytic ileus. The tube was removed 3 days later, after the patient’s symptoms had improved and he had defecated. He started to eat on POD 8, and he was discharged on day 16. DISCUSSION CD is commonly diagnosed in teenagers and young adults, many of whom are concerned about the cosmetic aspects of surgical incisions. 12 13 14 Previously, laparoscopic surgery was considered a good option to treat simple ileocecal CD cases; more recently, this approach has gained wider use. 7 15 17 5 There are many advantages of laparoscopic surgery: less postoperative pain, improved respiratory function, lower incidence of wound infection, lower risk of incisional hernia, lower risk of postoperative small bowel obstruction, faster recovery of bowel function, shorter hospital stay, and better cosmetic appearance. 13 18 21 22 2 23 25 The first study of laparoscopic surgery for CD with fistulas and abscesses in Japan reported complication and laparotomy conversion rates of 16%, respectively. The authors concluded that laparoscopic surgery for CD was safe and feasible. 7 26 The reported median length of the incision necessary for safe extraction from the peritoneal cavity of thickened diseased intestine with CD involvement is 4 cm in SILS. 8 8 9 27 9 8 9 One reason why SILS is possible for complex types of CD is that both physicians and surgeons are involved in the consultation and treatment of patients presenting with abscesses or phlegmon. Therefore, medical treatment or percutaneous drainage of the abscess may be performed preoperatively. Surgery is performed only after inflammation has been controlled and the patient’s nutritional status improves. 9 8 28 29 8 9 9 Our patient underwent successful SILS to treat a retroperitoneal abscess, ascending colon-cutaneous fistula, ascending colon-duodenal fistula, and marked shortening and inflammation from the cecum to the descending colon. SILS was possible after the abscess was drained and the inflammation improved. Compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, SILS is associated with better cosmetic outcomes, but surgical safety and long-term prognosis should always take priority. Therefore, SILS should be regarded as one of the treatment options only in carefully selected cases and performed at specialized IBD centers. The ECCO guidelines also recommend percutaneous drainage for intra-abdominal abscesses if possible. 5 While there are no specific reports on the exact number of laparoscopic surgeries or types of procedures required to make SILS feasible for CD, a report on the learning curve for SILS in colorectal cancer showed that for surgeons with sufficient experience in conventional laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery, the learning curve for right colectomy was between 6 and 15 cases, and for anterior resection was between 13 and 36 cases. 30 With complex CD, SILS can be achieved in selected cases with repeated learning in CD surgeries at specialized high-volume IBD centers, learning characteristic surgical techniques, and performing the procedure under the guidance of an experienced mentor. However, in some complex cases, emergency surgery may be required, and it may be difficult to transfer the patient to a specialized center. In such situations, we believe that conventional multi-port laparoscopic surgery, which is feasible in most facilities, should be the preferred approach. Furthermore, as reported by Simillis et al. 31 32 5 33 Conventional multi-port laparoscopic surgery and hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery are superior to SILS in terms of operability and instrument freedom and are considered particularly useful for complex adhesion dissection and fistula resection. 34 34 CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic subtotal colectomy can be an option in suitable cases, such as those with CD-related abscesses and complicated fistulas, in which inflammation has been controlled.
