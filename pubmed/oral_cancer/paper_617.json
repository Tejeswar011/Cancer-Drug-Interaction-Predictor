The impact of OSA offers a major challenge to health systems globally. Therapeutic approaches encompass surgical interventions, non-pharmacological therapies (exercise, rehabilitation, behavioral interventions) and pharmacological treatments. Inflammatory processes within OSA joints are regulated by pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Etodolac, a COX-2-selective inhibitor, is the gold standard for OSA management and uniquely does not inhibit gastric prostaglandins. This comprehensive review offers insights into OSA's pathophysiology, genetic factors and biological determinants influencing disease progression. Emphasis is placed on the pivotal role of etodolac in OSA management, supported by both preclinical and clinical evidences in topical drug delivery. Notably, in silico Article highlights Introduction Osteoarthritis extremely affects the quality of life of people in addition to economic burden on the society. Osteoarthritis influences physical functioning, mental health and social life. Pathophysiology of osteoarthritis: current understanding Osteoarthritis is a prevalent joint disorder characterized by losing articular cartilage, primarily affecting the hip, knee and spine joints. Diagnosis of osteoarthritis: advancements in imaging technologies Magnetic resonance imaging is one of the most promising clinical techniques for diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Biomechanical modeling integrated with artificial intelligence algorithms is advantageous in predicting onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis. Etodolac: a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor recommended for the management of osteoarthritis Etodolac is the gold standard for osteoarthritis management and does not inhibit gastric prostaglandins. Etodolac has the prospective advantage of not destroying articular cartilage in vivo Etodolac topical delivery offers reduced side effects and controlled release at the site of action. Topical delivery of etodolac using nano-drug delivery cargo Addition of lidocaine to etodolac ionic liquid augmented permeation efficiency. Nanoemulsion of etodolac enhanced topical drug delivery to suppress edema. Niosomal etodolac topical gel offered superior anti-inflammatory activity. Future prospects: combination therapy or integrated nanotechnology strategies In-silico Integration of artificial neural network techniques with nanotechnology driven drug delivery systems may serve to boost topical etodolac delivery.
