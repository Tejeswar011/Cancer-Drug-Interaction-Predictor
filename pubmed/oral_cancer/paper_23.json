Summary Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are widely used to inhibit inflammatory cytokine signaling in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, but their effect on regulatory T cells (Tregs) is poorly characterized.

Upon engagement of their cognate targets, cytokine receptors recruit one or more of the four Janus kinase (JAK) family proteins (JAK1-3 and Tyrosine kinase 2 [TYK2]) to trigger signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family proteins, ultimately altering gene expression. 4 4 , 5 Multiple JAK inhibitors have now received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and are in clinical use to manage a variety of diseases. 5 6 7 8 Recently, TYK2-specific inhibitors, such as deucravacitinib, have been developed to allosterically inhibit kinase activity by binding to the pseudokinase domain. 9 , 10 4 TYK2 11 , 12 , 13 TYK2 TYK2 A + + 14 15 16 A key differentiator between TYK2 and JAK inhibitors is the effect on IL-2-stimulated JAK1/3 signaling, which is a crucial pathway required in Tregs for expression of FOXP3, their lineage-defining transcription factor. 17 , 18 4 , 5 2 , 19 , 20 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 21 In this work, we investigated the effect of BMS-986202, a selective TYK2 antagonist, on primary human Tregs and compared this to upadacitinib, a JAK inhibitor that is FDA approved for use in RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. 5 ex vivo Results TYK2 inhibition does not affect IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation To validate BMS-986202 as a selective TYK2 antagonist, 9 5 IFN-α-induced phosphorylation of STAT1, which is mediated through JAK1/TYK2 ( Figure 1 4 Figures 1 Figures 1 4 Figure 1 BMS-986202 inhibits TYK2-mediated cytokine signaling in Tregs Tregs were treated with varying concentrations of BMS-986202 (B202) or upadacitinib (UPA) for 1 h and then stimulated with cytokine for 15 min.

Supernatants were collected after 3 days of culture and analyzed ( Figure S2 Given the aforementioned negative impact of upadacitinib on Treg functional marker expression, we next tested the suppressive capacity of Tregs, which were cultured for 7 days in the presence of varying concentrations of upadacitinib or BMS-986202. To test suppression, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads and cultured for 72 h in the absence or presence of Tregs, which had been pre-treated with inhibitors and then washed, so the assay was in the absence of any inhibitors.

Consistent with the effect of BMS-986202 on Th17-polarized LPMCs ( Figure 6 Figures S7 Figures S5 S7 Figures S7 Overall, TYK2 inhibition shifts the phenotype of gut-infiltrating T cells in a Th17 environment from inflammation toward regulation, as evidenced by increased Treg numbers and immune checkpoint receptor expression. Discussion Finding therapies that block inflammation while sparing, or even enhancing, Treg function is a long-sought-after goal for numerous autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. TYK2 inhibition using BMS-986202 surprisingly enhanced Treg phenotype, epigenetic stability, and function, while simultaneously preventing the differentiation of naive CD4 + + Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as IBD, are marked by an increase in T cell activation and reduction in Treg numbers and suppressive function. 3 , 36 + + + 37 4 , 38 39 + Under inflammatory conditions, Tregs can exhibit plasticity to gain Th1-like or Th17-like properties, characterized by the secretion of IFN-γ and IL-17, respectively. 28 28 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 31 , 32 , 33 , 44 Surprisingly, we found that TYK2 inhibition improved Treg suppressive function even in the absence of exogenous inflammatory cytokines. Tregs can suppress effector T cell proliferation and activation by a number of mechanisms, including competition for IL-2 by CD25 expression, CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells, anti-inflammatory cytokine production, and adenosine production by CD39 ectoenzymes. 2 + 45 29 , 30 + The preservation and enhancement of Treg function are major therapeutic advantages of TYK2 inhibition. In clinical trials, JAK inhibition is associated with a reduction in circulating Treg numbers, 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 7 46 in vivo 47 48 7 20 , 49 The development of highly specific JAK inhibitors has been challenging due to the high shared homology between JAKs in the ATP-binding domain, which is most commonly bound by inhibitors. 5 9 , 50 51 , 52 46 52 ON044580 4 , 5 In addition to high drug selectivity for TYK2 via allosteric binding, BMS-986202 and deucravacitinib are unique among JAK inhibitors due to target specificity, conferring promising potential for targeted immune modulation. TYK2 is involved in comparatively fewer cytokine signaling pathways relative to other JAK family proteins. 4 In the clinical context, specificity and selectivity of inhibitors must be weighed with reductions in potency and therapeutic scope, as evidenced by the comparative efficacy of deucravacitinib versus conventional JAK inhibitors in IBD. Conventional JAK inhibitors targeting primarily JAK1-3, such as tofacitinib, filgotinib, and upadacitinib, have proven effective for IBD treatment. 7 7 53 54 55 , 56 In summary, we observed that TYK2 inhibition preserves Treg phenotype, enhances suppressive function, and shifts the Th17/Treg balance toward a regulated phenotype. In contrast, the JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib, had a profoundly negative impact on Tregs and Treg differentiation. Overall, TYK2 inhibition has a targeted effect on inflammatory pathways, while preserving the regulatory component of the immune system. Therefore, improving Treg function via TYK2 inhibitors may contribute to long-term re-establishment of immune homeostasis and, as a result, promote durable remission in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Limitations of the study Altogether, these data reveal critical effects of TYK2 and JAK inhibition on Tregs as well as other T cell subsets. However, several questions remain, which could not be addressed in this study. Firstly, we observed no difference in the cytokine responses or phenotype of LPMCs from healthy versus IBD donors. Due to limited sample numbers, our study is underpowered to investigate these differences, particularly as IBD is highly heterogeneous 57 , 58 Table S1 in vivo in vitro Resource availability Lead contact Requests for further information and resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Megan K.

Tregs were treated with upadacitinib, BMS-986202, or deucravacitinib for 1 h before stimulation with IL-12 (50 ng/mL; STEMCELL Technologies), IL-23 (50 ng/mL; PeproTech), IFN-α (40,000 U/mL; STEMCELL Technologies), IL-2 (100 U/mL), or IL-15 (25 ng/mL; STEMCELL Technologies) for 15 min. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized using the Transcription Factor Phospho Buffer Set (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were stained using anti-pSTAT1, anti-pSTAT3, anti-pSTAT4, or anti-pSTAT5 ( Table S1 Cytokine analysis To quantify cytokine secretion, cell-free supernatant was collected from cultures 3 days after initial stimulation or 24 h after re-stimulation with CD3/CD28 T cell Activators. Cytokines were quantified using the LEGENDplex 12-plex Human Th Cytokine Panel (BioLegend) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and samples were analyzed using a BD FACS Symphony A1 (BD Life Sciences) flow cytometer. For intracellular cytokine staining, 2 × 10 5 Table S1 TSDR analysis TSDR analysis was carried out as previously described. 59 Treg suppression assay Suppression assays were carried out in Immunocult-XF supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 5% human serum (NorthBio). PBMCs were labeled with CPD eFluor450 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Tregs were labeled with CPD eFluor670 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 1 × 10 5 + + 60 + − LPMC isolation and culture Instestinal biopsies were digested for 1 h with Collagenase Type VIII (Sigma-Aldrich) and DNAse (STEMCELL Technologies) prior to filtering through a 100 μm mesh. CD45 selection was carried out using Human CD45 Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. CD45 + Quantification and statistical analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 10.2.3 (GraphPad Software, Boston, Massachusetts USA).
