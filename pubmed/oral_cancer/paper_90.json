In LMICs, PCOS management is hindered by late diagnosis, lack of awareness, and high treatment costs which leads to long-term complications. Objective The aim of the review is to document the challenges in PCOS diagnosis and management in LMICs and provide public health solution to overcome these barriers in accordance with SDG goals. Methods A narrative review synthesizing existing literature on PCOS epidemiology, barriers to diagnosis and treatment, and potential solutions relevant to LMICs. Results Key challenges include lack of uniformity in diagnosis and treatment, lack of trained HR and equipment. High cost of care, stigma and fragmented health care. Outcomes/proposed solutions Develop national PCOS guidelines, bring the management of PCOS under the reproductive health program, shift some of the tasks to primary health workers, like generating awareness and screening for symptoms. Invest in research to find public health solutions. Conclusion Addressing PCOS in LMICs requires a multi-sectoral public health approach, including prevention, early detection, and affordable care. Strengthening healthcare systems through policy reforms and community-based interventions can improve outcomes for affected women.

The Rotterdam criteria defines it as a combination of features like hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology ( 1 2 2 3 4 5 The complexities involved in the diagnosis and management of PCOS are more pronounced in low—resource settings than in developed ones. Low and middle income countries (LMICs) are part of a classification system developed by World bank that classifies based on gross national income capita, where healthcare resources are limited ( 6 7 8 9 10 9 11 12 14 13 15 16 Efforts to address PCOS in these settings require a comprehensive approach that includes preventive measures, early diagnosis, and community-based interventions ( 1 8 17 18 7 8 2 Challenges to PCOS management in LMIC This section describes the various bottle necks that prevent PCOS women of LMICs from getting holistic care, which includes challenges in diagnosis and treatment ( Figure 1 19 20 Figure 1 Bottlenecks for PCOS management in LMICs. Diagram illustrating challenges in managing PCOS in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Central circle labeled \\\"Challenge in PCOS management in LMIC\\\" is surrounded by factors: lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, low adherence to lifestyle changes, mental health challenges, fragmented healthcare systems, high cost of treatment, cultural and societal barriers, and lack of equipment and trained HR. 2.1 Challenges in diagnosis 2.1.1 Lack of standardised diagnostic criteria The absence of uniform diagnostic criteria for PCOS the world is one of the barriers for PCOS diagnosis. The 3 most common guidelines are the 2003 Rotterdam Consensus and the criteria of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AE-PCOS) ( 21 Rotterdam criteria: Claims that two of the following three features should be hyperandrogenism (HA), oligo/anovulation (OA), and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound for a woman to full fill the PCOS classification, while the absence of the remaining feature is being compensated by two other features ( 22 NIH: Specifies that the diagnosis should include hyperandrogenism and oligo/anovulation but exclude the ultrasound findings ( 23 AE-PCOS Criteria: States that women should have hyperandrogenism and at least one other feature to be diagnosed with PCOS ( 24 Due to the variability of the disease, the symptoms of PCOS it is often a matter of controversy among medical practitioners and sometimes the diagnosis is inconsistent especially in primary care settings. Women are often treated without adequate diagnosis which leads to inappropriate treatment. Furthermore, the condition can worsen ( 1 The diagnosis of PCOS is further complicated by varying phenotypic presentations such as phenotype-A which includes all the three criteria for diagnosis, phenotype-B includes hyper androgenic and oligo anovulatory features (HA + OA), phenotype-C has features of hyper androgenism and polycystic ovaries (HA + PCOM), and phenotype-D (OD + PCOM). Phenotype-A is more common in subjects identified in clinical populations, whereas phenotype-C is more common in unselected populations ( 22 25 In low-resource settings, a simpler diagnostic method based on clinical features like oligomenorrhoea and hirsutism might be a practical alternative to the full Rotterdam criteria. This is particularly true when hormonal tests or pelvic ultrasounds are not possible. These models have been suggested as useful tools for early detection and referral from primary care ( 24 26 2.1.2 Lack of equipment and trained human resources (HR) In rural and poor settings, access to diagnostic tools such as high-resolution ultrasound and hormonal assays is limited and knowledge on how to diagnose and screen this disorder is limited ( 27 28 29 30 Symptoms related to puberty like irregular periods, acne, and hirsutism may be misinterpreted as normal development or other health issues. This can lead to delay in the right diagnosis and effective treatment ( 30 31 32 2 PCOS also has symptoms that are common with other medical conditions entitled, thyroid diseases, hyperprolactinemia, and adrenal hyperplasia ( 33 34 4 2.1.3 Cultural and societal barriers In many cultures, menstruation and infertility are stigmatized topics , 31 33 33 8 35 36 2.2 Challenges in PCOS treatment 2.2.1 High cost of treatment PCOS management often involves a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches for several years. Medications like oral contraceptives, metformin, and clomiphene citrate are frequently prescribed in tandem ( 37 38 39 Table 1 Table 1 Key diagnostic and treatment challenges of PCOS. Challenge Description Evidence and references Lack of standardized diagnostic criteria Inconsistent criteria (Rotterdam, NIH, AE-PCOS Society) cause diagnostic variability. Phenotypic differences complicate diagnosis further. Variability of PCOS symptoms and diagnostic criteria leads to inconsistent diagnoses ( 23 40 Lack of equipment and trained human resources Limited access to ultrasound, hormonal assays, and trained specialists in rural settings results in under diagnosis. Insufficient access to diagnostic tools and clinical knowledge in primary care settings ( 25 30 Cultural and societal barriers Menstruation and infertility stigma discourage women from seeking care, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Cultural stigmas surrounding menstrual health and infertility in conservative societies delay care-seeking ( 31 33 High cost of treatment Long-term PCOS management requires medications and lifestyle modifications, which are often inaccessible due to high costs. Out-of-pocket expenses in LMICs can lead to catastrophic expenditure ( 7 39 Fragmented healthcare systems Lack of multidisciplinary care results in symptom-based treatments, primarily for infertility, with long-term complications overlooked. Short-term treatment goals dominate care due to fragmented systems and lack of follow-up ( 41 42 Mental health challenges High rates of anxiety, depression, and body image issues are prevalent but rarely addressed in PCOS treatment. Mental health services are often absent or stigmatized in PCOS management, especially in low-resource settings ( 43 44 Low adherence to lifestyle changes Socioeconomic barriers, cultural factors, and lack of structured programs hinder adherence to lifestyle interventions. Women in rural areas lack safe spaces for physical activity and access to nutritious food ( 45 46 Metformin is one of the most affordable medications for diabetes, PCOS and other metabolic syndrome ( 47 48 2.2.2 Fragmented healthcare systems The treatment of PCOS requires a team of gynaecologists, endocrinologists, dietitians, and mental health professionals work together, but many a case, these are not available in rural as well as in other low resource settings, the specialists if present tend to work on only one aspect of the syndrome and do not take sufficient care to council with rest of the other specialists to provide comprehensive care ( 41 49 PCOS is associated with long-term issues such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and endometrial cancer. Despite this, treatment in many settings remains focused on short-term goals like regulating menstrual cycles or inducing ovulation. Long-term complications are often overlooked, particularly in low-resource settings where regular follow-up and preventive care are unavailable ( 1 2.2.3 Mental health challenges Anxiety, depression, and body image issues are prevalent among women with PCOS, with studies indicating significantly higher rates compared to the general population ( 50 43 2.2.4 Low adherence to lifestyle changes Lifestyle modification is a cornerstone of PCOS management, yet adherence remains low due to socioeconomic barriers, lack of support, and cultural factors ( 45 Summary of the challenges in PCOS diagnosis and management, in LMIC context, in Nepal, sociocultural norms often discourage adolescent girls from seeking reproductive health care, compounding delays in PCOS diagnosis ( 35 23 9 3 Public health solutions This section discusses, public health solutions like, prevention and early intervention approaches for PCOS, models of cost-effective care and policy changes ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Framework for comprehensive PCOS management in LMIC. Flowchart illustrating the process for reducing the burden of PCOS in LMICs. It begins with awareness and early detection through school-based education and community campaigns, feeding into diagnosis and treatment access, supported by task-shifting, mobile clinics, and digital health tools. Comprehensive healthcare includes integration into health programs and is bolstered by standardized guidelines and multidisciplinary care. Policy advocacy, financial support, subsidies, insurance, and research contribute to reduced PCOS burden, leading to the achievement of SDG goals. 3.1 Prevention and early intervention in PCOS Promoting lifestyle modifications, implementing early diagnosis and treatment are effective strategies contribute holistic care for those diagnosed with PCOS, consequently healthcare costs can be reduced ( 51 52 53 54 55 Figure 3 Figure 3 Prevention and early intervention framework for PCOS care in LMIC. Flowchart depicting Prevention and early intervention framework for PCOS care in LMIC. School and community campaigns lead to awareness and education, feeding into early screening and diagnosis. Screening for risk factors and biomarker-based diagnosis in adolescence are connected to early screening. Stress reduction and lifestyle interventions, enhanced by behavioral modification, contribute to prevention and early intervention. Rural outreach directly connects to prevention efforts. 3.1.1 Early screening and diagnosis The timely detection of PCOS is important ( 56 55 57 58 3.1.2 School-based preventive approaches Educating adolescent girls about menstrual health and the risk factors of PCOS is a cost-effective strategy for recognition of risk factors related to PCOS and encouraging healthy behaviours ( 59 25 12 35 3.1.3 Early interventions Lifestyle interventions like exercise and dietary modification, is an important cornerstone of PCOS prevention and management ( 55 56 60 61 62 Regular exercise has been proven to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce androgen levels, and promote weight loss in women with PCOS. Even moderate-intensity activities, such as brisk walking or yoga, can yield significant benefits ( 63 24 Chronic stress exacerbates PCOS symptoms by disrupting hormonal balance. Stress-reduction techniques, such as mindfulness, meditation, and cognitive-behavioural therapy, are effective in improving mental health and overall quality of life ( 64 In low-resource settings, dietary change programs can be supported by school-based initiatives, women-led self-help groups, and nutritional counselling included in primary healthcare systems. In India, similar models have shown success in tackling child and maternal under nutrition ( 65 67 3.2 Cost-effective models of care for tackling PCOS 3.2.1 Task-shifting models Task-shifting models represent a strategy of redistributing responsibilities from specialists to trained nurses and primary care physicians ( 68 43 69 70 Table 2 Figure 3 Table 2 Cost effective models of care in PCOS. Intervention Description Evidence and references Task-shifting models Redistributing responsibilities from specialists to trained nurses, primary care physicians, and community health workers (CHWs). Successful in South Africa (NCD care), HIV care models, CHW-led healthcare in India ( 71 Includes early identification, lifestyle interventions, and follow-up for metabolic disorders. Empowering CHWs with portable diagnostic tools improves adherence and follow-up ( 72 73 Digital health in primary care Telemedicine provides virtual consultations, reducing travel costs and improving access for rural populations. Mobile health applications improve adherence to lifestyle changes and medication digital risk profiling ( 74 Enables primary care physicians to consult specialists remotely for diagnosis and treatment adjustments. Digital health use in cardiovascular risk profiling and personalized care in New Zealand ( 9 75 Community mobilization Mass campaigns raise awareness about PCOS symptoms and promote early diagnosis and health-seeking behavior. Campaigns leveraging radio, TV, social media, and events reduce stigma and encourage preventive care ( 76 Collaborative programs with schools, workplaces, and community groups enhance early recognition and support systems. Workshops for adolescents and male engagement help foster supportive ( 77 Adding task-shifting models can also result in earlier diagnosis and management, thus preventing such long-term complications as infertility, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease ( 69 50 70 Successful case studies of utilization of task shifting models for non-communicable disease care has been reported in South Africa. Where screening for hypertension which was traditionally done by physician were reallocated to physician assistants ( 78 79 Community health workers (CHWs) have long been instrumental in delivering primary healthcare services in underserved regions ( 80 81 82 78 49 79 The cost-effectiveness of these three approaches, task-shifting to primary care physicians, structured training for nurses, and CHW-led interventions, has been clearly shown in LMIC health systems. In Uganda, training nurses to conduct cardiovascular and metabolic risk screening cut per-patient costs by 30% compared to physician-led services, without affecting diagnostic accuracy ( 83 84 85 Simple body measurements such as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) strongly relate to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in PCOS. They offer a practical, low-cost option for early risk assessment in field situations ( 86 3.2.2 Digital health in primary care Advancement in technology even brought telemedicine which is a game changer in the way we should approach PCOS care for those women who live in the countryside and accessible areas of the country ( 87 88 Moreover, telemedicine assists patients’ interaction through educating materials and guiding on the modification of their lifestyles according to their needs ( 52 88 53 Studies in Asia has shown that the use of mobile application in helping improve patient adherence to lifestyle intervention in NCD care. A study in New Zealand has showcased the use of digital health in risk profiling in cardiovascular illness, using real time data, which helps make personalised treatment strategies and improve health outcomes ( 89 90 New Zealand's CONNECT trial showcased the viability of app-based follow-ups and health coaching for chronic conditions, which includes work with metabolic disorders ( 75 87 74 88 91 92 93 3.2.3 Community mobilization Raising awareness about PCOS through mass campaigns is essential to reduce stigma, encourage early diagnosis, and promote health-seeking behaviour ( 94 8 Such campaigns can leverage various media, including radio, television, social media, and community events, to disseminate information ( 61 62 Mass campaigns also play a pivotal role in advocating for policy changes and increasing public investment in PCOS care. By generating widespread awareness and demand for services, these initiatives can drive the expansion of healthcare infrastructure and resources dedicated to PCOS management ( 1 63 3.3 Public health policy needs for PCOS management 3.3.1 Integration into reproductive health programs Embedding PCOS diagnosis and management into existing reproductive and maternal health programs can optimize resource utilization and improve accessibility. Training and incentivising existing public health human resources like PHC medical officers, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) to screen for PCOS symptoms and provide basic counselling can be a cost-effective solution ( 95 96 64 97 Integrating chronic disease management into reproductive health services has shown clear success in low- and middle-income countries and sets a strong example for managing PCOS. In Tanzania, including hypertension and diabetes screening in HIV and antenatal clinics cut patient travel time by 40% and increased detection rates for non-communicable diseases without needing additional staff ( 98 99 3.3.2 National guidelines for PCOS management The establishment of standardized national guidelines tailored to low-resource settings is essential for consistent and effective PCOS management ( 100 100 101 Nationally adapted guidelines for chronic disease care in low- and middle-income countries show that standardization can improve consistency and quality in settings with limited resources. In South Africa, the Primary Care 101 guideline incorporates algorithms for non-communicable diseases into primary health care practice ( 102 103 3.3.3 Subsidized healthcare services Subsidizing diagnostic tests, medications, awareness generation through mass campaigns and lifestyle counselling can alleviate the financial burden of PCOS management for low-income populations ( 56 104 105 50 57 In Kenya, government-funded non-communicable disease clinics offer free screening for diabetes and hypertension, reducing out-of-pocket costs and improving follow-up ( 99 15 3.3.4 Multi-disciplinary care PCOS being a muti faceted causes manifestations like the reproductive, metabolic, dermatological and psychological. These might require care from various specialists like obstetricians, endocrinologists, dermatologists and psychiatrist for comprehensive care. Centres like University of California, San Francisco, National institute for research in reproductive health conduct multi-disciplinary clinics to treat PCOS cases ( 16 64 In South Africa, multidisciplinary NCD clinics bring together reproductive, metabolic, and mental health services in one place. This setup lowers patient drop-out rates and helps people stick to lifestyle changes ( 13 14 3.4 Research priorities for comprehensive management of PCOS 3.4.1 Epidemiological studies Large-scale epidemiological studies are crucial to understanding the true prevalence and phenotypic variations of PCOS in India ( 106 3 Table 3 Table 3 Research priorities for comprehensive management of PCOS. Research area Description Evidence and references Epidemiological studies Large-scale studies to find the prevalence and phenotypic variations of PCOS in diverse populations. ( 2 Cost-effective diagnostic tools Developing simplified ultrasound protocols and low-cost biomarker tests to improve accessibility. ( 107 Role of community, culture, and economics Community-based lifestyle programs leveraging local resources for sustainable interventions. ( 108 Implementation research Evaluating training programs for primary healthcare workers and integrating digital health solutions. ( 8 Screening and surveillance Developing and validating surveillance tools for early PCOS detection and monitoring high-risk groups. ( 109 3.4.2 Cost-effective diagnostic tools development Developing low-cost diagnostic tools, such as simplified ultrasound protocols or biomarker-based tests, can significantly improve accessibility in resource-constrained settings ( 110 17 Table 3 107 3.4.3 Role of community, culture and economics Pilot studies evaluating community-based lifestyle intervention programs can provide evidence for scalable solutions to PCOS management ( 55 59 Research exploring the cultural and socioeconomic determinants of PCOS can inform the development of targeted interventions ( 58 51 3.4.4 Implementation research Implementation research is critical to integrating PCOS management into existing healthcare systems. There is a need to evaluate training programs for primary healthcare providers and community health workers and assessing effectiveness of improving delivery of these using CHWs lead community-based interventions ( 54 The role of digital health tools, such as mobile apps for symptom tracking and telemedicine for remote consultations, should be explored as cost-effective alternatives for PCOS management ( 68 64 3.4.5 Screening and surveillance Screening and surveillance strategies and tools can help in early detection of PCOS risk factors and symptoms among adolescents and young women, studies can be made on developing and validating such surveillance tools and algorithms ( 111 112 4 Conclusion To improve PCOS management in low resource setting where there is inadequate availability of trained health professionals, certain components of it can be merged into primary healthcare systems to improve early identification and comprehensive care. Task shifting models that have proven effective for other programs including diabetes mellitus control program, which involves training community health workers, such as ASHAs and ANMs, can increase awareness reduce stigma and promoting early detection. Embedding PCOS management into reproductive and maternal health programs can utilize existing infrastructure for better resource utilization. Simultaneously, establishing national guidelines tailored to resource-constrained settings ensures equitable and consistent care delivery. While lowcost options like metformin are available, care should be taken to prescribe those cost-efficient medications though primary care centres, and subsidized tertiary care can ensure access to care, and catastrophic expenditure for low-income populations. Research into cost-effective diagnostic tools, scalable lifestyle interventions, and digital health solutions is vital for addressing gaps in PCOS management. A coordinated effort involving government, NGOs, and private stakeholders is crucial for comprehensive management of PCOS to achieve SDG by 2030. By prioritizing prevention, affordability, and accessibility, public health policies can reduce the burden of PCOS and help mitigate the burden of PCOS and its complications.
