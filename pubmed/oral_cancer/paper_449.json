Our objective was to identify the predictive factors associated with favorable pathologic response in these individuals. Methods We analyzed data from patients diagnosed with primary rectal cancer who underwent preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) followed by radical surgery at Changhua Christian Hospital. Information regarding patient demographics, clinical and pathological characteristics, laboratory data collected at baseline and during CRT, as well as perioperative details, was extracted from medical records. These patients were categorized into good-responder and poor-responder groups. We employed Kaplan–Meier curve analysis to evaluate overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and logistic regression to assess the variables related to treatment response. Results Overall, 98 patients were enrolled. A strong pathological response to preoperative CRT correlated with improved OS and DFS among patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The introduction of simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) in long-course radiotherapy (RT) enhanced the pathological response while maintaining manageable acute toxicity. Conclusions Implementing SIB in long-course RT enhances treatment response while maintaining acceptable acute toxicity. Further studies are required to identify additional predictive factors.

Responses to preoperative CRT vary among individuals. The histopathological response to preoperative therapy has been shown to be a potential predictor of outcomes after surgery. Approximately 15% of the patients achieve pCR [ 3 4 5 4 6 To identify potential predictive factors for a good pathologic response, we retrospectively reviewed the medical literature at Changhua Christian Hospital and evaluated the outcomes of preoperative CRT for rectal cancer. We also evaluated the clinical and pathological responses of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant CRT. The predictive value of pathological response to preoperative CRT was also investigated, and the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed. Methods Patients We retrospectively reviewed our institutional cancer registry. Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage T3/T4N0 or T(any)N+ (AJCC Staging System, 7th Edition) or locally unresectable rectal cancer who were referred to the department of radiation oncology for preoperative CRT followed by radical surgery at Changhua Christian Hospital (CCH) between January 2010 and December 2018 were included. The observation period lasted from January 2010 to July 2023. Eligible patients were ≥ 20 years old, diagnosed with histologically confirmed primary rectal cancer, and free of distant metastases. The staging workup included abdominal computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Patients who did not undergo radical surgery or were operated on at other hospitals after CRT, had a history of another malignancy before rectal cancer, or had a previous history of pelvic irradiation were excluded. This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision). Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Changhua Christian Hospital (approval number: 200812). The requirement for individual consent was waived for this retrospective analysis, as the research involved no more than minimal risk. Data collection The relevant demographic characteristics and clinical and pathological variables of each patient were extracted. Pretreatment/during CRT/perioperative hematologic parameters, including white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb) level, platelet (PLT) count, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte percentage, monocyte percentage, systemic immune-inflammation index, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, were collected. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of the diagnostic biopsy until death. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from the date of radical surgery to the date of local recurrence, distant metastasis, or death. Treatment Preoperative CRT is recommended in patients with T3/T4N0, T(any)N+, or locally unresectable rectal cancer [ 2 3 Concurrent radiotherapy, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), or image-guided volumetric-modulated radiation therapy (IG-VMAT), was delivered to the whole pelvis, with or without intensity-modulated radiotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost (IMRT-SIB)/volumetric-modulated arc therapy with simultaneous integrated boost (VMAT-SIB) to the primary gross tumor. Using a 10-MV linear accelerator with patients in the supine position, radiotherapy (RT) was administered in fractions of 1.8–2 Gy/day, 5 days a week for 5–6 weeks. A three-dimensional treatment planning system was used for treatment planning. The target volume included the primary tumor, perirectal fat tissue, mesorectum, and presacral and pelvic lymph nodes. The patients underwent surgical intervention 12 weeks after the completion of RT. The surgical method was based on the clinical judgment of the surgeon. Evaluation of therapeutic response Pathological assessment of preoperative CRT response was conducted using the AJCC tumor regression grading system as follows: TRG0, no residual tumor cells; TRG1, single cell or small group of cells; TRG2, residual cancer with desmoplastic response; and TRG3, minimal evidence of tumor response. We divided the patients into two groups based on their AJCC tumor regression grade and pathological findings: good responders (TRG0-1) and poor responders (TRG2-3). The primary endpoint of the study was the pathological tumor response according to the AJCC cancer tumor regression grading system. Statistical analysis Predictors of a good pathological tumor response were analyzed using logistic regression. Univariate factors suggesting an association with a good pathologic tumor response were selected as variables in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Kaplan–Meier curve analysis and Cox regression models were used to estimate OS and DFS. Statistical significance was set at p ® ® Results A total of 98 patients were included in the study, comprising 71 males (72.4%) and 27 females (27.6%).

Logistic regression analysis identified younger age ( p p p Most patients tolerated preoperative CRT well. Gastrointestinal toxicity was the most common treatment-related complication. Two patients in the poor responder group experienced grade 3 proctalgia (one treated with IMRT and one with IG-VMAT). Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 37 patients (37.8%). Discussion Owing to revolutions in treatment modalities, including total mesorectal excision (TME), neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the management of locally advanced rectal cancer has improved significantly. With the emergence of neoadjuvant therapy as the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer, the degree of tumor regression has become an important prognostic factor [ 7 8 IMRT-SIB/VMAT-SIB Compared with 3D-CRT, IMRT/VMAT treatment improved tumor-dose conformity and adjacent organ-at-risk sparing and reduced the irradiation of the small bowel and treatment-related toxicity without hindering dose escalation to tumor volume. Compared to other elective procedures, IMRT-SIB/VMAT-SIB has the clinical and dosimetric advantages of increasing the fraction size of the boost volume with a low dose. Several phase II clinical trials using SIB-IMRT/SIB-VMAT reported good oncologic outcomes with acceptable toxicities [ 9 10 Initial CEA concentration Related studies have reported that initial CEA concentration is a significant independent predictive factor for downstaging [ 11 12 13 14 Importance of pCR In 1995, Chari et al. [ 15 3 Total neoadjuvant therapy Recent advancements, particularly findings from the RAPIDO trial [ 16 17 Neoadjuvant RT can be administered through short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) or long-course CRT. Evidence from the Polish I trial [ 18 19 18 TNT protocols can follow two distinct sequences: induction chemotherapy (INCT) followed by CRT/SCRT, or CRT/SCRT followed by consolidation chemotherapy. Both approaches have demonstrated superior therapeutic outcomes compared to conventional preoperative CRT with or without subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy [ 16 17 20 The CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial [ 21 22 21 22 NCT04246684 23 Limitations This retrospective study has several limitations. First, the chemotherapy regimens and surgical approaches were not standardized and varied according to physician preferences. In addition, some hematologic parameters were unavailable due to the constraints of retrospective data collection. Second, at Changhua Christian Hospital, only a proportion of patients with LARC were referred for preoperative CRT (42.86% in 2019, with even fewer in earlier years), and some of these patients did not undergo surgery following CRT. Recently, Melton et al. [ 24 Third, although previous studies (e.g., Melton et al. [ 24 Finally, while TNT with SCRT followed by delayed surgery has shown promise in improving pCR rates, the role of SIB in this context remains uncertain. Further prospective, multi-center studies with larger patient cohorts are required to confirm the present findings and clarify the balance between efficacy and toxicity. Conclusions In this retrospective cohort, a favorable pathological response to preoperative CRT was associated with improved OS and DFS in patients with LARC. Delivery of long-course RT with SIB was associated with higher pathological response rates, with manageable acute toxicity. These results suggest a potential role for SIB in treatment intensification; however, the findings should be interpreted with caution given the retrospective design and limited cohort size. Future research should focus on validating predictive biomarkers and optimizing CRT protocols through well-designed prospective trials.
