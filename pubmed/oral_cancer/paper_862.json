However, these procedures are not without risk, particularly with respect to post-procedural infections. While rare, such infections can have significant clinical consequences and are increasingly recognized as a public health concern. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of infections associated with GI endoscopy, focusing on transmission mechanisms, microbial agents involved, host susceptibility, preventive strategies, and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Infections following GI endoscopy remain infrequent but clinically significant, particularly in high-risk procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound.

Introduction In recent years, interventional gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has undergone exponential growth in its capacity to manage a wide range of pathologies affecting the entire GI tract. Novel endoscopic techniques have been developed for the resection of polypoid lesions, the treatment of biliary and pancreatic diseases, and even for performing bariatric procedures. Many of these conditions were previously managed surgically; therefore, the transition from conventional surgery to endoscopic therapy represents a major advancement in the medical field, leading to reduced healthcare costs as well as improved morbidity and mortality outcomes [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 The incidence of GI endoscopy-associated infections varies depending on the type of procedure performed and patient-related factors, with the pooled overall rate reported at 0.2% [ 7 8 9 A recent article reiterated that digestive endoscopy-associated infections remain an important concern, with multiple reported outbreaks, including those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, even after high-level disinfection (HLD). This review highlights two important issues: the need for post-procedural infection surveillance beyond 30 days and the inappropriate use of antibiotics due to false-positive microbiological results obtained from patients examined with already contaminated endoscopes [ 10 Looking back at a 2018 report, infections transmitted through flexible endoscopes ranked among the top ten health technology hazards [ 11 12 The aim of this narrative review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the pathogens that can be transmitted through GI endoscopy, infection rates, current challenges and techniques in the reprocessing of flexible endoscopes, prevention strategies, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics in interventional endoscopy according to current guidelines, as well as key aspects in the diagnosis and management of post-endoscopic infections. This review serves as a valuable resource for both clinicians and researchers, offering up-to-date and relevant information while summarizing the most important data regarding infections associated with endoscopic procedures. This narrative review was structured around a central research question (what are the current insights into the pathogens, risk factors, and prevention strategies for infections associated with digestive interventional endoscopy?) and organized into key thematic sections addressing the types of interventional endoscopy, mechanisms of infection transmission, implicated pathogens, risk factors, and prevention and management strategies. To identify the relevant literature, we conducted a search using PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. We focused on articles published in the last decade but included older studies when particularly relevant. The selection was based on relevance, originality, and contribution to the understanding of endoscopy-associated infections. We used combinations of keywords and MeSH terms such as: “digestive endoscopy”, “endoscopy-associated infections”, “cross-infection”, “bacterial pathogens”, “viral hepatitis”, “healthcare-associated infections”, “risk factors”, “antibiotic prophylaxis”, “infection control”, and “post-endoscopic complications”. Additional references were retrieved by reviewing the bibliographies of selected papers and guidelines. 2. Types of Interventional Endoscopy of the Gastrointestinal Tract GI endoscopy can be categorized into two main types: diagnostic and interventional. Both approaches can be applied to the upper and lower GI tract. Endoscopy emerged from the need to visualize the digestive tract through natural orifices, with its origins tracing back to antiquity. The introduction of flexible endoscopes and fiber optics has paved the way for increasingly complex endoscopic procedures capable of managing conditions that were once treated exclusively through surgical means [ 13 14 Transient bacteremia may occur during endoscopic procedures, with specific risk rates associated with each type of procedure. However, this does not necessarily lead to clinical infection, as transient bacteremia can also arise during routine daily activities such as tooth brushing without any clinical consequences in the absence of relevant patient risk factors [ 4 15 Contamination rates vary depending on the type of flexible endoscope used. Duodenoscopes, which are considered to be among the primary vectors for exogenous infection transmission, show contamination rates ranging from 0.3% to 30%, while the associated risk of infection in patients has been reported to range between 12% and 41% [ 5 Hutfless et al. analyzed a cohort of over 800,000 ERCPs and reported a post-procedural infection rate of 3.5% at 7 days and 7.7% at 30 days. Identified risk factors for infection included emergency ERCP, pre-existing infections, chronic comorbidities, age over 65 years, male sex, and non-white ethnicity [ 16 17 In another study, Wang et al. evaluated the incidence of infections at 7 and 30 days following endoscopic procedures across six U.S. states. The post-procedural infection rate after a screening colonoscopy was 1.1‰, while for non-screening colonoscopies it was 1.6‰, and for upper GI endoscopies it reached 3.0‰ at 7 days. At 30 days, these rates increased to 4.0‰, 5.4‰, and 10.8‰, respectively. These rates also include complications related to general anesthesia and the risk of aspiration pneumonia [ 6 In PEG, the most common infection is at the stoma site, with reported rates ranging from 4% to 30%. This occurs despite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, which, according to some studies, does not appear to significantly reduce the risk [ 18 19 For ESD, data on infectious complications are limited. However, post-procedural fever has been reported in 46.7% to 58.3% of cases, without clear evidence of active infection, and is often attributed to alternative mechanisms such as post-coagulation syndrome [ 20 21 22 23 3. Mechanisms of Infection Transmission During Endoscopic Procedures There are two main mechanisms of infection transmission during GI endoscopic procedures: (1) endogenous transmission, involving pathogens that colonize the patient or are part of an ongoing infection and can be translocated to other anatomical sites during the procedure, potentially leading to infections, and (2) exogenous transmission, which refers to the inoculation of microorganisms introduced via contaminated endoscopes or their accessories [ 24 3.1. Endoscope-Related Transmission GI endoscopy procedures involve the use of reprocessable flexible endoscopes such as gastroscopes, duodenoscopes used in ERCP and EUS, and colonoscopes, all of which require complex reprocessing protocols. Their structure is intricate due to the presence of internal channels, external components such as the duodenoscope elevator mechanism, and other accessories that may affect optimal reprocessing. In addition to the challenges related to the complex design of the endoscope, there is also a risk of biofilm formation within the working channels, especially through microfissures in the internal lining that may occur with repeated use. Contamination of flexible endoscopes is one of the main processes leading to healthcare-acquired infections caused by MDR bacteria and fungi, particularly in patients with immunosuppression. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms and reprocessing methods of flexible endoscopes is essential in order to reduce infection rates associated with GI endoscopic procedures [ 25 26 In clinical practice, differentiating between endogenous and exogenous infections is often challenging. Infections caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria are frequently attributed to an endogenous mechanism, although they may also originate from contaminated devices, particularly duodenoscopes. In contrast, infections caused by MDR bacteria are less commonly reported despite being typically exogenous. This ambiguity contributes to the underestimation of the true incidence of post-endoscopic infections and hinders the accurate identification of their source. A study by Kwakman et al. estimated the risk of duodenoscope-associated infection (DAI) to be 0.01% per ERCP procedure, a value approximately 180 times higher than previously reported [ 27 Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterobacter 7 28 Contamination rates of endoscopes are significant, ranging from 7.7% to 34.6%, depending on the type of device. Duodenoscopes, whether used for ERCP or EUS, have reported contamination rates between 0.697% and 60%. Infections with MDR bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa K. pneumoniae 29 3.2. Transmission via Healthcare Workers Transmission of microorganisms from healthcare workers to patients represents a real risk during endoscopic procedures and is primarily associated with non-compliance with protective standards, particularly the improper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Proper use of PPE provides bidirectional protection, reducing the risk of pathogen transmission both to the patient and to the healthcare worker [ 30 31 Endoscopy unit personnel are at an increased risk of colonization or infection with pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori Mycobacterium tuberculosis 32 In addition to the risks posed to patients, healthcare workers themselves are also vulnerable to infections transmitted from patients. Documented cases of transmission include accidental needlestick injuries and conjunctival exposure to infectious secretions, particularly for bloodborne viruses [ 33 Clostridioides difficile C. difficile C. difficile 34 3.3. Patient-to-Patient Transmission The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) classifies pathogen transmission from one patient to another as either endoscopic or non-endoscopic. Endoscopic transmission occurs as the result of inadequate reprocessing performed by healthcare personnel, while non-endoscopic transmission is the result of the improper use of drug vials or syringes [ 31 The administration of intravenous anesthetics, proper disinfection of endoscopes, and adherence to hygiene protocols play a critical role in preventing the transmission of infections between patients. However, studies have shown that healthcare personnel tend to apply stricter disinfection measures when the patient is known to have a transmissible infectious disease such as HBV, HCV, HIV, or tuberculosis. This practice, observed for several decades, still persists today despite the fact that many patients are either unaware of their infectious status or choose not to disclose it due to fear of stigmatization. A study conducted by Cowen in 1993 highlighted this discrepancy: in 96% of endoscopy units, full disinfection was performed for patients known to have HIV or HBV, compared to only 55% for patients suspected of having infectious colitis [ 35 Aseptic medication administration errors represent a significant risk, particularly in the context of screening colonoscopies in high-risk populations, such as individuals aged 50 to 59 years, the age group with the highest prevalence of HCV infection in the United States. A notable case reported in 2010 described the transmission of hepatitis viruses through the repeated use of the same syringe to administer propofol to multiple patients. Contamination of a vial intended for single-patient use resulted in infections in 12 patients: 6 with HBV, 5 with HCV, and 1 with HBV/HCV coinfection. No HIV infections were reported in this context [ 36 4. Infectious Agents Involved 4.1. Bacteria A retrospective study conducted between 2015 and 2017, which included 12,714 patients who underwent endoscopic procedures (upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy, ERCP, and enteroscopy), reported an overall incidence of post-procedural bacteremia of 0.43%. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli Enterococcus faecalis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Klebsiella 37 Up to 15% of duodenoscopes deemed adequately reprocessed and ready for use in ERCP or EUS may still be contaminated with bacteria carrying significant infectious potential. Among the most frequently identified pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Enterobacteriaceae Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus Enterococcus 38 39 40 Helicobacter pylori Serratia marcescens Clostridioides difficile Salmonella Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Acinetobacter 41 42 The infectious risk varies depending on the type of procedure performed. In diagnostic upper GI endoscopy, the most frequently isolated bacteria are Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus Enterococcus Enterobacteriaceae Bacteroides Staphylococcus aureus Klebsiella Enterobacter Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterococcus Candida albicans Escherichia coli Enterococcus 24 The etiology of post-endoscopic infections is often multifactorial. The most important contributing factors include the improper reprocessing of endoscopes, the complex and difficult to clean design of certain devices (such as the duodenoscope elevator mechanism), as well as potential structural defects. In some cases, no clear cause can be identified, which complicates both the prevention and surveillance of these infections [ 43 4.1.1. Klebsiella Over the past decade, infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae 44 Klebsiella pneumoniae 45 Even with strict adherence to HLD protocols, the use of automated endoscope reprocessors (AERs), and proper storage of endoscopes, infections or asymptomatic colonization cannot be entirely eliminated. Major risk factors for invasive infections include the use of duodenoscopes (both for ERCP and EUS), upper GI endoscopic procedures, and a history of cholangiocarcinoma [ 45 46 47 A study conducted by Humphries et al. identified nine cases of infection and seven asymptomatic carriers of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bla OXA-232 47 Alrabaa et al. also reported seven cases of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae 48 Cimen et al. documented the transmission of a K. pneumoniae bla SHV-12 49 In a case reported in Colombia, three post-ERCP infections with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae 50 4.1.2. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Similarly to other bacteria involved in post-endoscopic infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 51 52 Verfaillie et al. reported an outbreak of infections caused by VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa 53 In another study, Reiner et al. identified three cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa 54 Bajolet et al. also reported four cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 55 4.1.3. Escherichia coli Escherichia coli 56 E. coli E. coli E. coli 57 A major outbreak reported in 2014 involved 39 cases of infection with carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli 58 The persistence of endoscopy-associated infections remains a major concern despite technological advances and the introduction of new endoscope designs. In 2024, eight cases of infection or colonization with Escherichia coli 59 4.1.4. Enterococcus Post-endoscopic infections with Enterococcus Enterococcus 60 A study conducted by Kühl et al. on a cohort of liver transplant recipients reported a post-ERCP infection rate with Enterococcus faecium 61 Although rare, post-endoscopic infective endocarditis has been reported in the literature, particularly in association with interventional endoscopic procedures. One documented case describes a 71-year-old patient with known mitral regurgitation who developed infective endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecalis 62 Enterococcus faecalis 63 4.1.5. Helicobacter pylori Helicobacter pylori 64 65 4.1.6. Clostridioides difficile Post-endoscopic Clostridioides difficile 66 C. difficile 67 Special attention should be given to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in whom the risk of developing C. difficile 68 69 4.2. Viral Hepatitis and Other Viruses Transmission of viruses through endoscopes is considered a rare but possible event, particularly in the context of inadequate reprocessing. Studies have shown that although the use of endoscopes in patients with HBV can result in contamination of working channels with viral DNA, standard HLD methods are generally effective in eliminating it, even under suboptimal conditions [ 70 71 72 Another study from 1978 showed that, although radiolabeled hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detectable after routine reprocessing, none of the patients exposed to the same endoscope developed the infection [ 73 74 75 Recently, Liu et al. reported a 10.4% contamination rate of endoscopes with HBV immediately after variceal ligation in infected patients. However, viral DNA was no longer detectable following standard cleaning and HLD [ 76 77 78 79 Regarding HCV, the most common modes of transmission are associated with hospitalization, breaches in aseptic technique, or the improper use of medication vials and syringes for injectable drug administration [ 80 81 33 33 82 36 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 Regarding HIV, no cases of transmission through GI endoscopy have been reported, although it is theoretically possible in the presence of a defective working channel and improper reprocessing. The highest risk of HIV transmission has been associated with the reuse of disposable syringes for anesthesia administration [ 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 91 4.3. Prions Prion diseases are rare but fatal neurodegenerative conditions caused by abnormal prion proteins that undergo misfolding, resulting in pathological conformers resistant to cellular degradation. These proteins predominantly accumulate in the central nervous system but can also be identified in the small intestine, particularly in Peyer’s patches, as well as in the spleen, tonsils, and appendix [ 97 98 Although no confirmed cases of prion disease transmission through GI endoscopy have been reported to date, major societies such as the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) have issued strict recommendations regarding preventive measures in this context [ 31 99 31 99 100 Esophageal intubation should be performed with utmost care under direct visual control by an experienced endoscopist in order to avoid injury to the tonsils, which, as previously mentioned, may serve as a potential reservoir for prions. If tissue sampling is absolutely necessary, biopsies should be obtained using single-use forceps, and the working channel of the endoscope should be cleaned between each pass to reduce the risk of subsequent contamination [ 99 Concerning reprocessing, it is recommended to avoid the direct application of glutaraldehyde-based agents on contaminated endoscopes before mechanical cleaning and prior rinsing, as glutaraldehyde has protein-fixing properties, including for prions, which may promote their adherence to the internal surfaces of the endoscope [ 101 100 Modern automated endoscope reprocessing technology plays an important role in reducing prion protein contamination, ensuring superior decontamination compared to manual methods [ 101 4.4. Fungi Fungal infections associated with GI endoscopic procedures are rare, owing to the overall effectiveness of standard reprocessing protocols, which successfully eliminate most fungi that may contaminate endoscopes [ 95 102 Trichosporon asahii 103 Candida 104 Candida 105 Candida glabrata Candida albicans Staphylococcus aureus 106 Candida tropicalis 107 Candida albicans 108 In conclusion, although post-endoscopic fungal infections are rare, they can have a significant clinical impact, particularly in cases of immunosuppression, when complex devices such as duodenoscopes are involved, or when fungal biofilms develop within reprocessing systems. This category of infection warrants close monitoring and a rigorous preventive approach in endoscopy centers. 4.5. Parasites Regarding parasitic infections, available data are limited. To date, four cases of parasitic infection have been reported, involving patients diagnosed with esophagitis caused by Strongyloides 109 5. Risk Factors for Transmission of Infections After Endoscopy Conditions associated with an increased risk of post-endoscopic infections include decompensated cirrhosis with upper GI bleeding, cirrhosis with large-volume ascites, immunosuppression due to malignancy or immunosuppressive therapy, peritoneal dialysis, and biliary obstructions in which complete drainage of the bile ducts cannot be ensured (e.g., cholangiocarcinoma, primary sclerosing cholangitis) [ 4 110 4 Patients with a history of malignancy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or organ transplantation who are undergoing immunosuppressive treatment are at a significantly increased risk of developing post-endoscopic infections, often caused by MDR organisms. A 2013 study from the United States reported three cases of infection with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in patients who underwent ERCP using the same duodenoscope. The index patient, a 57-year-old man, underwent ERCP for acute cholangitis due to choledocholithiasis; the second patient, aged 72, developed urinary sepsis two months after ERCP; and the third, a 23-year-old, experienced sepsis with the same pathogen six months post-procedure. All patients had underlying oncologic, hematologic, or autoimmune conditions known to be associated with immunosuppression [ 111 An infectious risk assessment should encompass all equipment that comes into direct or indirect contact with patients. Decristoforo et al. conducted microbiological testing on reprocessed endoscopes and AERs, reporting contamination rates ranging from 1.3% to 4.6%. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas Pseudomonas oleovorans Streptococcus Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa 112 A study conducted in Taiwan on 112,543 patients assessed the 30-day incidence and risk of infection following diagnostic colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, biopsy, or polypectomy. The most frequently reported infections were diverticulitis (37.96%), peritonitis (25.55%), appendicitis (13.38%), osteomyelitis (7.79%), pyogenic liver abscess (5.60%), and septic pulmonary embolism (1.95%). The authors developed a predictive nomogram for infection risk, identifying significant variables such as advanced age, male sex, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, cholangitis, cholecystitis, and chronic kidney disease, with cirrhosis having the strongest impact. Therefore, a 70-year-old patient with cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease should be considered at high risk for post-endoscopic infectious complications [ 113 E. coli K. pneumoniae E. faecalis 114 Control of post-endoscopic infectious risk involves optimizing techniques that increase diagnostic accuracy, such as the use of simethicone to disperse residual air bubbles and mucosal secretions. Simethicone is administered via the water or working channel of the endoscope. However, it is difficult to remove during reprocessing, potentially contributing to contamination due to incomplete drying and its carbohydrate content, which provides a substrate for bacterial growth and proliferation [ 115 116 Monitoring the effectiveness of endoscope reprocessing should include the assessment of residual bioburden, preferably through rapid and cost-effective methods such as ATP testing [ 117 118 119 120 121 As illustrated in Figure 1 6. Preventive Measures for Endoscopy-Associated Infections Factors contributing to endoscope contamination despite the use of HLD include device-related issues (such as aging endoscopes or defects in the working channel), human factors (including inadequate training or non-compliance with reprocessing guidelines), insufficient drying, and the use of substances that may interfere with the reprocessing cycle, such as simethicone or lubricants [ 122 A retrospective study reported a contamination rate of up to 49% for endoscopes considered ‘ready for use’ after reprocessing [ 26 The importance of pre-cleaning and the manual reprocessing of endoscopes must be emphasized, as these steps together reduce more than half of the total bacterial load [ 123 124 125 Several aspects of the endoscope reprocessing workflow still lack international consensus. These include the role of alcohol flushing and the type, quality, and duration of air flow, as well as the optimal drying time required before immediate use following HLD. Additionally, factors such as the storage cabinet conditions, vertical versus horizontal positioning of the endoscopes, the maximum storage interval before repeat reprocessing is required, and whether accessories should be stored together or separately from the endoscopes remain open questions in need of standardization [ 126 Flushing endoscope channels with alcohol at concentrations of 30–50% can accelerate the drying process and reduce the risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 127 126 The literature data indicate that both the 3 min air and alcohol-drying cycle and the 10 min air-drying cycle available in AERs are insufficient for the complete removal of moisture from narrow channels (e.g., air/water channels). In contrast, these methods are effective for larger-diameter channels, such as the biopsy channel. These findings highlight the need to optimize and individualize the drying process, even when using AERs [ 128 The water used for rinsing the endoscope and its channels must be properly filtered. Most post-endoscopic infections are associated with ERCP and EUS procedures, which commonly utilize duodenoscopes. The most challenging part to clean and reprocess is the duodenoscope’s elevator mechanism, which remains difficult to adequately disinfect even when using AERs. Therefore, manual cleaning remains essential for the effective decontamination of both the elevator and the working channel [ 129 The steps of endoscope reprocessing may vary depending on the availability of AERs within the endoscopy unit [ 130 130 131 130 132 130 The Spaulding classification [ 133 134 135 Conducting routine microbiological surveillance cultures of endoscopes can serve as an effective tool for monitoring the adequacy of reprocessing and for detecting potential breaches or errors in the decontamination process [ 136 26 137 130 138 An emerging innovative approach to enhance bacterial eradication during endoscope reprocessing involves the use of side-emitting ultraviolet type C (UV-C) fiber optics, which can be inserted into the internal channels of the endoscope. This method offers significant advantages, such as low maintenance costs due to the lack of consumables, and has shown promising bacteriological efficacy in experimental models. However, it remains at the experimental stage and has not yet been incorporated into international reprocessing guidelines [ 139 6.1. Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Infection Prevention ESGE generally does not recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis prior to ERCP. However, antibiotic prophylaxis before ERCP is suggested in the following situations: patients in whom complete biliary drainage is not anticipated (e.g., in primary sclerosing cholangitis or hilar obstructions), immunocompromised patients, and cases involving cholangioscopy [ 140 Intraductal antibiotic prophylaxis administered concurrently with a contrast medium injection has been evaluated in several studies. One randomized controlled trial found no significant difference between gentamicin and distilled water injection (both mixed with the contrast medium) during ERCP performed for malignant biliary obstructions, mainly cholangiocarcinoma. All patients also received systemic antibiotic therapy, and clinical follow-up was conducted for up to 72 h post-procedure [ 141 142 Regarding antibiotic selection, ESGE recommends adaptation to local epidemiology and the use of an agent active on Gram-negative pathogens [ 140 61 In patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) presenting with variceal upper GI bleeding, ESGE recommends prompt antibiotic prophylaxis, preferably ceftriaxone, for up to 7 days. However, some studies suggest that a 3-day course may be sufficient [ 143 Similarly to ESGE, the ASGE guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing ERCP for biliary obstruction in the absence of clinical cholangitis, only when complete biliary drainage is unlikely to be achieved [ 144 For EUS procedures, the ASGE advises antibiotic prophylaxis when performing an FNA of pancreatic or mediastinal cysts. Additionally, prophylaxis is indicated for all patients undergoing PEG placement, as well as for patients with cirrhosis presenting with acute upper GI bleeding starting from admission, regardless of the planned endoscopic procedure. Patients on peritoneal dialysis undergoing colonoscopy are also suggested to receive prophylaxis to prevent bacterial peritonitis [ 144 145 Regarding the prevention of infective endocarditis, the ASGE guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis only in patients with high-risk cardiac conditions when a GI infection involving Enterococcus 144 146 62 63 147 According to the Endoscopy Committee of the British Society of Gastroenterology, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in the following situations: ERCP without complete biliary drainage, FNA or endoscopic drainage of pancreatic cysts/pseudocysts, biliary complications following liver transplantation, PEG placement, variceal upper GI bleeding, and in immunocompromised patients with severe neutropenia or hematologic malignancies undergoing high-risk endoscopic procedures. While prophylaxis is unanimously supported for these patient groups, it is not recommended solely on the basis of increased cardiovascular risk for infective endocarditis in patients undergoing ERCP [ 148 Table 1 6.2. Hygiene Practices for Healthcare Workers In most endoscopic procedures, the use of anesthesia has become a standard practice that enhances both patient and endoscopist comfort. However, the administration of anesthetic agents involves invasive techniques such as peripheral venous catheterization, which breach natural protective barriers and increase the risk of infection. The intravenous administration of analgesics, anesthetics, or fluids must be performed under strict aseptic conditions in accordance with international infection control standards [ 150 151 Reusing syringes or administering intravenous medication from the same syringe to multiple patients is strictly prohibited. The use of single-dose vials is strongly recommended for each individual patient. If multi-dose vials are used, they must be accessed with a new sterile disposable needle or cannula for each patient to prevent cross-contamination [ 152 A notable example highlighting the consequences of non-compliance with these safety practices occurred in Las Vegas in 2007, when six individuals contracted HCV following endoscopic procedures. The outbreak was traced to the reuse of disposable syringes and vials for administering intravenous medication to multiple patients. As a result, over 40,000 patients from the implicated clinic were notified about the potential risk of HCV exposure [ 153 7. Diagnosis and Management of Infections Associated with Interventional Endoscopy Clinical signs of infection associated with GI endoscopic procedures may include fever, chills, abdominal pain, dyspnea, urinary symptoms, altered general condition or mental status, and, in severe cases, signs of septic shock. These manifestations typically occur within 30 days following the procedure [ 154 EUS-FNA carries a significant risk of mediastinitis, particularly in patients undergoing the procedure for cystic mediastinal lesions or necrotic mediastinal lymphadenopathy [ 155 156 The Charcot triad (comprising fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain) has a high specificity but low sensitivity for diagnosing acute cholangitis. In other words, while the presence of all three signs strongly supports the diagnosis, many cases may not present with the full triad. According to the 2018 update of the Tokyo Guidelines for the management of acute cholangitis [ 157 3 3 A diagnosis of suspected cholangitis requires at least one item from category A in combination with one item from either category B or C. A definite diagnosis requires the presence of at least one item from each of the three categories [ 157 158 159 As this is a healthcare-associated infection, the generally accepted risk window for post-ERCP infections ranges from 1 to 30 days after the procedure [ 154 159 160 161 Post-ERCP cholangitis can be classified into three categories: Mild cholangitis is defined by the onset of a fever ≥38 °C, lasting 24–48 h; moderate cholangitis is characterized by a febrile or septic state requiring hospitalization for more than 3 days or the need for endoscopic or surgical intervention; and severe cholangitis is marked by the development of septic shock or the necessity of surgical treatment. [ 162 163 Patients undergoing PEG are frequently immunocompromised, often due to underlying malignancies and concurrent chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. As a result, the risk of infection remains elevated, even when prophylactic antibiotics are administered. Infections can manifest early (within 7 days) or late (after 7 days), typically presenting with peristomal erythema and purulent discharge at the insertion site [ 164 Patients undergoing GI endoscopic polypectomy may develop postprocedural fever, which can arise from several potential causes, including post-polypectomy coagulation syndrome or GI perforation. Jing et al. reported two cases of post-polypectomy infections following a colonoscopy, where patients presented with a high fever (39–40 °C) within hours to a few days after the procedure, in the absence of clinical or imaging evidence of GI perforation or other infectious sources. Clinical management in such cases may escalate to intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to the progression toward multiple organ dysfunction. The diagnostic workup should include a physical examination to exclude peritonitis, inflammatory, and sepsis markers (e.g., C-reactive protein, procalcitonin) and to obtain a complete blood count and contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis [ 165 7.1. Methods of Diagnosis Diagnostic methods for post-ERCP cholangitis are diverse and include imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), as well as repeat ERCP with bile sampling for microbiological cultures to identify the causative pathogen and guide targeted antibiotic therapy [ 166 154 167 In general, the accurate identification and epidemiological linkage of post-ERCP infections requires concordant microbiological findings from bile, blood, and duodenoscope cultures, all isolating the same microorganism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis can be employed to determine clonal relatedness between isolates from patient samples and those obtained from endoscopic equipment [ 168 Upper GI endoscopy carries the risk of esophageal perforation, a complication that can lead to mediastinitis. The clinical picture is often non-specific, with fever, chills, and tachycardia being common findings. Laboratory tests may reveal leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, while progression to sepsis can be accompanied by thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Diagnosis relies on imaging, with a contrast-enhanced CT of the neck and chest being the modality of choice. From a microbiological standpoint, esophageal perforation in previously healthy adults without recent antibiotic exposure typically yields Streptococcus Neisseria Haemophilus Staphylococcus aureus Candida 169 Post-polypectomy infections may occur either as a result of transient bacteremia or as a complication of colonic perforation. These infections should be distinguished from post-polypectomy coagulation syndrome, which presents with a similar clinical presentation including abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting, along with laboratory findings such as neutrophilic leukocytosis and an elevated C-reactive protein. The differential diagnosis relies primarily on CT to rule out pneumoperitoneum, which would suggest perforation [ 170 6 146 In the case of post-PEG infections, it is essential to obtain samples from the peristomal site for bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing. The most commonly isolated pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19 7.2. Infection Prevention and Control; Infection Management An effective strategy to prevent pathogen transmission during interventional endoscopy is the implementation of redesigned duodenoscope models in endoscopy units. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends replacing traditional duodenoscopes with fixed endcaps with models featuring disposable endcaps. This approach significantly reduces the risk of procedure-related infections, particularly in complex interventions such as ERCP [ 171 7.2.1. Management of Post-ERCP Infections Management of post-ERCP cholangitis includes conservative, endoscopic, and surgical approaches, chosen based on the patient’s clinical status and the location and extent of the infection. Conservative therapy, consisting primarily of intravenous antibiotics and supportive care, represents the first-line treatment. In cases where conservative measures are unsuccessful, biliary decompression becomes necessary, typically through repeat ERCP with stent insertion or replacement or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Surgical intervention is reserved for refractory cases or when endoscopic and percutaneous methods are contraindicated or unsuccessful [ 172 3 157 Haal et al. reported that a 3-day course of antibiotic therapy was sufficient in cases of acute cholangitis with complete biliary drainage achieved via ERCP. The empiric antibiotic regimens used in their study included: piperacillin/tazobactam (16.6%), ceftriaxone plus metronidazole (14.2%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (14.2%), ceftriaxone plus gentamicin (11.8%), ceftriaxone alone (11.8%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plus gentamicin (11.5%), and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plus ciprofloxacin (10.8%) [ 173 174 175 In a 2020 study by Kawamura et al., the most frequently used empiric antibiotic regimen was sulbactam/cefoperazone. In cases with prior sphincterotomy or biliary stent placement associated with a higher risk of Enterococcus Enterococcus 176 176 Unfortunately, empirical antibiotic therapy is effective as a first-line treatment in only a limited number of cases due to the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance [ 177 178 7.2.2. Management of Post-EUS Infections Antimicrobial therapy for infections associated with GI endoscopic procedures should be individualized based on clinical severity and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of the antibiotics, including their ability to reach effective concentrations at the site of infection. Bacteremia associated with EUS procedures occurs in 0–5.8% of cases, although clinically apparent infections remain rare [ 17 155 179 180 7.2.3. Management of Post-Polypectomy Infections Mild to moderate infectious complications following colonoscopic polypectomy are typically managed with bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics [ 170 165 7.2.4. Management of Post-PEG Infections Management of post-PEG infections involves local antiseptic care of the peristomal site and the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In early or mild cases, oral or enteral antibiotic therapy may be sufficient, while intravenous administration is required for severe infections. If there is no clinical improvement, treatment must be escalated. In cases complicated by peritonitis, abscess formation, or persistent infection, removal of the gastrostomy tube and surgical intervention may be necessary [ 181 7.2.5. Management of Post-Endoscopic Endocarditis Although rare, infective endocarditis may develop as a complication following GI endoscopic procedures. Management requires the early initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy, and, in severe cases, surgical intervention with replacement of the affected valve may be necessary [ 63 According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, the treatment of infective endocarditis should be individualized based on the causative pathogen and the type of valve involved (native vs. prosthetic). For Enterococcus faecalis 146 8. Limitations and Future Directions This review is intended to provide a current, comprehensive, and detailed picture of GI-associated infections; however, several limitations should be acknowledged. The cited references demonstrate substantial heterogeneity due to their worldwide origin. Reported infection rates vary considerably according to geographic region, type of endoscopic procedure, patient-specific factors, and the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy, which differs from one center to another. Most of the included studies report a post-procedural follow-up limited to 30 days, which is not entirely adequate from an epidemiological perspective. In addition, some of the cited literature consists of case reports or outbreak-related case series, which do not provide a clear estimate of the global risk of these infections. Viral infections, although very rarely reported, have not been the subject of recent studies in the past years (2020–2025). Most contemporary studies focus instead on MDR bacterial infections and on novel approaches for endoscope reprocessing. Regarding future perspectives, multicenter observational studies are needed to accurately document infections occurring after GI endoscopy, ideally extending the follow-up to 90 days, and supported by epidemiological investigations based on genetic sequencing (particularly for MDR bacteria). The recently updated guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis in GI endoscopy should be implemented in most countries in order to assess their validity and real-world applicability. Furthermore, prospective studies evaluating new methods of endoscope reprocessing must continue at an accelerated pace in parallel with the development of novel duodenoscope models designed to overcome the shortcomings of current devices in terms of reprocessing. Prospective studies are also warranted in high-risk patient populations, with targeted periprocedural prophylactic strategies. Future research should also address in greater depth the mechanisms of infection transmission, as well as the implications, utility, cost, and environmental impact of single-use duodenoscopes. Finally, the diagnosis of GI endoscopy-associated infections should be individualized and incorporated into clear standardized diagnostic protocols for both clinicians and researchers. 9. Conclusions While procedures such as diagnostic upper GI endoscopy or diagnostic colonoscopy carry low rates of infectious adverse events, others such as ERCP or PEG placement are associated with a higher risk. GI endoscopy-related infections may be caused by viruses, bacteria, prions, fungi, and parasites, with the vast majority of reports involving bacteria, with MDR bacteria being particularly problematic. Effective prevention requires a combination of rigorous reprocessing protocols, adherence to hygiene standards, judicious use of antibiotic prophylaxis, and the regular microbiological surveillance of equipment. Equally important is the early recognition and appropriate management of infections based on clinical presentation and procedure type. Future efforts must prioritize the development of optimal reprocessing technologies, the implementation of disposable endoscope components where appropriate, and the establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria for post-endoscopic infections. By integrating innovation, guideline adherence, and individualized risk assessment, clinicians can significantly reduce the burden of infection and improve the safety and outcomes of interventional GI endoscopy.
