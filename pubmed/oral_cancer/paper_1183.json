Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that affects approximately 0.5% of the global population [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Clinically, RA presents with joint pain, prolonged morning stiffness, swelling, and functional impairment, primarily affecting the small joints of the hands and feet [ 7 Diagnosis is based on the 2010 classification criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), which consider the number and type of affected joints, serological markers—such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA)—and acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [ 8 9 10 In terms of treatment, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) remain the cornerstone of RA management, with methotrexate as the first-line conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and biologics (bDMARDs) or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, also known as targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), reserved for patients with inadequate response [ 11 12 The aetiology of RA is multifactorial, involving a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, epigenetic modifications, and environmental factors such as smoking and alterations in the microbiome [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 17 Immune Cell Activation and Loss of Tolerance in RA RA originates from immunological dysregulation that results in a loss of tolerance to self-antigens and chronic activation of immune cells [ 19 + 20 21 Regulatory T (Treg) cells, which under physiological conditions regulate autoimmunity and maintain immune homeostasis, display impaired functionality in patients with RA [ 17 22 In parallel, a substantial body of evidence supports the critical role of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) in the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint disease. These cells not only respond to inflammatory stimuli but also actively contribute to the perpetuation of inflammation and joint destruction [ 23 24 25 26 In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of immune responses in RA. These small non-coding RNAs modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are implicated in key processes such as Th17 cell differentiation, the imbalance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity, and the regulation of FLS function [ 27 28 29 This review provides a critical and up-to-date overview of emerging therapeutic strategies in RA, with a particular emphasis on immune checkpoints, cell-based therapies, and miRNAs. The roles of these novel approaches in modulating immune responses and their translational potential for clinical application are discussed in detail. 2. Materials and Methods This article is a traditional narrative review and does not follow a systematic review protocol. The literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, focusing primarily on articles published within the last five years. Additional relevant publications outside this time frame were included when considered seminal or highly influential. Both preclinical and clinical studies were considered, with preference given to peer-reviewed original research and review articles in English. During the preparation of this manuscript/study, the authors used ChatGPT (GPT-4-turbo) for the purposes of refining the language and clarity of the text and for generating the image of the inflamed joint included in Figure 1 Figure 2 3. Immune Checkpoint Modulation in RA Immune checkpoints are crucial regulatory molecules that modulate T cell activation and peripheral tolerance, thereby preventing autoimmune responses and preserving immune homeostasis [ 30 30 Figure 1 3.1. CTLA-4 CTLA-4 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on activated T lymphocytes and Treg cells which competes with the costimulatory molecule CD28 for binding to CD80/CD86 ligands on antigen-presenting cells [ 31 32 In RA, the expression and function of CTLA-4 are reduced, contributing to impaired Treg-mediated suppression and aberrant immune activation [ 33 34 35 36 37 3.2. PD-1/PD-L1 The PD-1/PD-L1 axis plays a pivotal role in the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Engagement of PD-1 by its ligand, PD-L1, inhibits T cell proliferation and enhances the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus preventing excessive immune activation [ 38 39 In RA, elevated PD-1 expression on T lymphocytes has been observed, particularly in patients with active disease [ 40 41 + + 42 However, considerable controversy remains regarding the role of these molecules in RA. For instance, experimental models have demonstrated that enhancement of PD-L1 reduces joint inflammation, highlighting the potential of this pathway as a therapeutic target and disease biomarker [ 43 44 Beyond peresolimab, several other PD-1 agonists are under active development for RA. Rosnilimab, a PD-1 agonist IgG1 monoclonal antibody, has been shown to help re-establish immune balance by attenuating autoreactive T cell activity in a phase 2b clinical trial [ 45 46 + 46 Interestingly, this stands in sharp contrast to the oncology setting, where systemic PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab and pembrolizumab) enhances anti-tumour immunity but frequently induces immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as inflammatory arthritis [ 47 47 48 3.3. ICOS ICOS is expressed on activated T cells, including Treg cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, and is critical for the differentiation of Th17 lymphocytes [ 49 50 51 Patients with RA exhibit elevated ICOS expression on T lymphocytes within the synovial fluid, suggesting a role in promoting the inflammatory microenvironment [ 52 + 53 + + 54 4. Immune Regulation and Clinical Applications of miRNAs in RA miRNAs are single-stranded RNA molecules of approximately 20 nucleotides in length [ 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 These pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 [ 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 Figure 2 4.1. Pro-Inflammatory and Anti-Inflammatory miRNAs Recent studies in patients with RA have identified elevated levels of several specific miRNAs—including let-7d, miR-24, miR-126, miR-130a, miR-221, and miR-431—which may serve as potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers [ 68 Functional characterisation of these miRNAs has revealed diverse roles, with certain miRNAs exhibiting pro-inflammatory properties (e.g., miR-155), while others, such as miR-146a, display predominantly immunoregulatory effects [ 69 70 71 72 73 Among the pro-inflammatory miRNAs, miR-21, miR-26, and miR-155 are particularly prominent [ 74 74 75 76 69 77 Members of the miR-26 family also participate in RA pathogenesis. For instance, miR-26b suppresses FLS proliferation, invasion, and migration, while downregulating TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 expression [ 78 79 75 76 Conversely, miR-146a is among the most extensively characterised anti-inflammatory miRNAs [ 70 27 80 81 81 4.2. Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Therapeutic Response Biomarkers Circulating miRNAs are remarkably stable in biological fluids and have demonstrated considerable diagnostic and prognostic utility in autoimmune diseases. In RA, elevated levels of miR-16, miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223 have been detected in synovial fluid when compared to patients with non-inflammatory joint disorders [ 82 83 Among these, miR-223 plays a particularly important role in osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion [ 84 84 77 Taken together, current evidence suggests that only a subset of miRNAs—particularly miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223—have been consistently validated across RA patients, making them the most promising for clinical translation. In contrast, miRNAs such as miR-124 and miR-210 show anti-inflammatory potential but remain largely confined to exploratory or small-scale studies, while others (e.g., the miR-26 family) are restricted to preclinical investigations. This stratification highlights that although numerous miRNAs are mechanistically relevant, only a few currently stand as reproducible biomarker candidates, and none have yet reached clinical application. 5. Immunomodulatory Cell-Based Therapies Immunomodulatory cell-based therapies represent a promising frontier in the treatment of RA, aiming to restore immune tolerance and attenuate chronic inflammation [ 85 Table 1 5.1. CAR-T Cells CAR-T cells, initially developed for oncology, are now being investigated in autoimmune diseases such as RA [ 86 86 + + 87 88 5.2. Treg Cells Treg cells play a fundamental role in maintaining immune homeostasis; however, both their frequency and suppressive function are diminished in RA [ 98 89 90 Moreover, transfer of induced human Treg cells into CIA models results in decreased disease severity, reduced B cell activation, and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 91 91 5.3. TolDCs TolDCs are monocyte-derived cells differentiated in the presence of immunomodulatory factors such as autologous synovial fluid [ 93 92 + 92 Early clinical data are beginning to emerge. A phase I trial assessed intra-articular infusion of tolDCs in RA patients. While overall feasibility and safety were confirmed, stabilisation of knee symptoms was only observed in 2 of the 13 recruited patients—specifically those receiving the highest doses (10 7 93 A further limitation is the variability in tolDC generation protocols, which results in heterogeneous immunoregulatory capacity across studies [ 99 100 5.4. MSCs and Extracellular Vesicles MSCs are multipotent, self-renewing cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes [ 101 101 In a preclinical study, a triple therapy combining oligosaccharides, human placental extract, and rat bone marrow-derived MSCs exhibited strong anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects in a rat model of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis [ 94 94 94 In humans, evidence remains limited. A phase I/IIa clinical trial evaluated a single intravenous infusion of autologous adipose-derived MSCs in 15 patients with active RA [ 95 95 96 Further research has explored the utility of MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) as a cell-free alternative [ 97 97 97 97 While preclinical and early-phase trials suggest that MSC therapy would be safe in the short term, unresolved issues include their short persistence, potential senescence, and theoretical risks of malignant transformation [ 102 103 6. Therapeutic Perspectives and Challenges in RA Immunomodulation 6.1. Combination Strategies: Cell-Based Therapy, Immune Checkpoints, and miRNAs Combined therapeutic strategies aim to overcome the limitations of single-agent interventions. For example, MSCs preconditioned with interferon (IFN)-γ have been shown to reduce clinical signs of inflammation in CIA mouse models, although such evidence remains limited to preclinical research [ 104 96 6 96 105 Genetically engineered, antigen-specific Treg cells offer targeted immunosuppression by reducing pro-inflammatory Th17 cell populations and preventing bone damage, although such approaches have so far only been validated in preclinical models [ 106 107 + 108 109 MSCs engineered to overexpress miR-146a and deliver sEVs have been found to increase FoxP3 expression in Treg cells and promote elevated levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and IL-10 in CIA mice, once again representing preclinical advances [ 110 + 111 + 111 Nanoparticle-based delivery systems also offer innovative therapeutic strategies. Co-delivery of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen and miR-124 via nanoparticles has demonstrated enhanced anti-inflammatory effects and superior efficacy in a preclinical adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model [ 112 113 114 It is important to note that most of the evidence discussed in this review originates from preclinical models, particularly murine CIA- and GPI-induced arthritis. While these models are invaluable for mechanistic insights, their predictive value for human disease is limited. For example, multiple interventions that showed efficacy in CIA—including adoptive Treg transfer and MSC-derived vesicles—have demonstrated only modest or inconsistent effects in early clinical studies. Moreover, interspecies differences in immune cell subsets, cytokine networks, and pathophysiology contribute to a high attrition rate in translation to clinical trials [ 115 116 6.2. Current Limitations of Traditional Therapies Although targeted therapies have transformed RA management, significant challenges persist. Approximately 20% of patients experience inadequate response or treatment failure, a group now recognised as being affected by \"difficult-to-treat\" RA [ 117 118 A major cause of reduced efficacy is immunogenicity, particularly the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAbs), which occurs in up to one-third of patients receiving biologics [ 119 119 120 Pharmacogenomic studies have identified genetic polymorphisms associated with differential treatment responses. Variants in Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIIa ( FCGR3A NF-κB TLR4 IL-6R 121 122 123 124 A further limitation of current therapies is their limited regenerative capacity. Radiographic progression may continue even during apparent clinical remission [ 125 125 6.3. Towards Personalised Immunotherapy in RA Personalised medicine in RA is being advanced through the integration of clinical and molecular biomarkers, with single-cell transcriptomic technologies playing a pivotal role. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of PBMCs from RA patients has identified 18 immune cell subsets, revealing disease-associated signatures such as IFN-induced transmembrane 3 (IFITM3)-expressing monocytes, increased CD4 + 126 + 127 127 In FLSs from a TNF-α-induced preclinical mouse model of RA, single-cell analysis revealed that even after histological resolution, FLSs retained inflammatory signatures and secreted endothelial-disrupting factors, suggesting persistent disease activity despite apparent remission [ 128 + 129 129 Another innovative approach involves the use of digital twins—virtual representations of biological systems that model individual disease dynamics and therapeutic responses [ 130 131 132 133 Finally, liquid biopsies—including circulating cell-free DNA, immune cells, and extracellular vesicles—are emerging as valuable tools for non-invasive monitoring and personalised medicine [ 134 134 7. Conclusions Our understanding of RA has progressively evolved towards a multidimensional paradigm, in which immunomodulatory strategies, cell-based therapies, and cutting-edge omics technologies converge to redefine disease management. Advances in elucidating the immunological mechanisms underpinning RA have catalysed the development of innovative approaches—including immune checkpoint modulation, the deployment of immunoregulatory cells, and miRNA manipulation—which may collectively provide novel therapeutic avenues beyond conventional inflammation control. Despite these advances, several key challenges persist. The clinical heterogeneity of RA, along with primary and secondary resistance to biologic therapies and the limited regenerative capacity of current interventions, continues to compromise patient outcomes. In addition, the emergence of adverse effects associated with newer treatments—such as JAK inhibitors—highlights the need for rigorous safety evaluation in routine clinical practice. In this context, combinatorial strategies—such as co-administration of tolerogenic cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors, or the targeted delivery of anti-inflammatory miRNAs via exosomes—represent promising avenues to enhance therapeutic efficacy while mitigating adverse effects. Concurrently, the integration of molecular biomarkers, omics platforms, and artificial intelligence is paving the way for personalised medicine, enabling patient stratification, prediction of treatment response, and proactive optimisation of therapeutic interventions. Nevertheless, the successful implementation of these innovations requires addressing several critical barriers. These include the need for clinical validation across diverse populations, standardisation of therapeutic protocols, equitable access to advanced technologies, and the establishment of robust ethical and regulatory frameworks. Moreover, comprehensive monitoring of comorbidities and continuous pharmacovigilance will be essential to support a holistic and sustainable care model. In sum, current evidence supports a paradigm shift towards personalised immunomodulation in RA—an approach aimed not only at controlling inflammation but also at preventing structural joint damage and substantially improving patient quality of life. The future of RA management will depend on sustained multidisciplinary collaboration, technological integration, and an unwavering commitment to patient-centred care.
