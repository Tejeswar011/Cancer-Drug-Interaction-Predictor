It appears that a combination of many factors, primarily genetic background, environmental, host immune response, and a state of reduced microbial diversity are associated with IBD. Gut modulation by probiotics application represents one of the potential strategies for the prevention or treatment of IBD. The gut microbiota has the ability to influence host physiology either directly or through microbial metabolites. This review summarizes human randomized clinical trials that evaluate the usefulness of various probiotics in relation to the treatment, prevention, and maintenance of disease remission. probiotics ulcerative colitis Crohn’s disease Slovak Research and Development Agency APVV-23-0031 VEGA-1/0253/25 VEGA 1/0232/25 This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under theContract No. APVV-23-0031, project VEGA-1/0253/25 and project VEGA 1/0232/25. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a significant public health challenge worldwide, and is caused by a combination of host genetics, immunological imbalance, microbial and environmental factors [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 9 This review explores mechanisms by which probiotics can restore the balance of gut microbiota, increase short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production, increase the integrity of the gut mucosal layer, and reduce inflammation by degrading histamine, which are all essential in the treatment of IBD. Given the growing prevalence of IBD and the limitations of current treatments, this topic is timely and of great clinical relevance. 2. Intestinal Microbiota in Management of IBD Various diseases are associated with inflammatory processes asa natural defense responses mediated by active immune cells. Dysregulated, innate, and adaptive immune responses may be the result of an interaction between genetic abnormalities, environmental factors (diet, lifestyle, andstress), permeability of gut barrier, and altered intestinal microbiota in IBD [ 10 11 12 The increasing incidence of IBD in newly industrialized countries has been attributed to significant dietary changes, such as increased intake of refined sugars and processed foods and decreased consumption of plant-based foods [ 13 Microbiota play a significant role in the development, progression, and treatment of IBD. Gut dysbiosis is characterized by a reduction in beneficial microbiota and overall microbial diversity, as well as an excessive amounts of potentially harmful organisms. The dysbiosis in the gut is accompanied by many adverse impacts including dysfunctional mucosal epithelial cells, impaired of gut immune homeostasis, and uncontrolled gut inflammation. Studies have shown that gut dysbiosis is an important pathogenic factor in the development of IBD; the number of bacteria associated with inflammation in IBD patients is increased in comparison to healthy individuals [ 14 15 The numbers of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium longum Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Akkermansia muciniphila, Roseburia intestinalis Eubacterium rectale 16 17 Escherichia coli (E. coli) Bacteroides fragilis Fusobacterium varium Fusobacterium nucleatum Helicobacter species Campylobacter concisus. Clostridioides difficile B. fragilis 18 19 Proteobacteria 20 The role of the microbiome in IBD is supported by the identification of gene mutations associated with microbiome-immune interactions in patients with IBD. Genome-wide studies have identified over 200 genetic loci that are associated with IBD. Genes associated with an increased risk of IBD include nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2), immunity-related quanosine triphosphatase family M (IRGM), autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL-10R1), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL-10R2), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4-α), and cadherin 1 (CDH1). Incorporating a genetic panel that covers key genes could significantly improve the diagnosis and assessment of IBD [ 21 22 The first line of defense of the internal environment against the external environment is the gut barrier, an important aspect of IBD, which contains intact and tightly attached epithelial cells. The gut is exposed to many factors (food antigens, resident microbiota, pathogenic organisms, etc.). The role of the barrier is, firstly, to prevent the penetration of useless antigens, and secondly, the passage of nutrients through the intestinal wall. In IBD, this barrier is disrupted, causing its increased permeability. The direct causes of increased permeability are unknown. The regulation of gut epithelial permeability is associated with alterations in CARD15/NOD2, OCTN1, CD1H, and C1ORF106 genes [ 23 Homeostasis of the mechanisms involved in maintaining a functional intestinal barrier is a key factor in the initiation and progression of IBD. The disruption of the functionality and integrity of the intestinal barrier occurs due to excessive activation of immunocompetent cells in the mucosa (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), which subsequently produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), disrupting tight junction proteins (TJPs) between epithelial cells, thereby contributing to the formation of ulcerations and the degradation of the GIT mucosa [ 24 25 26 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 27 Intestinal macrophages are key immune cells in the maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and have a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. Dharmasiri et al. [ 2 The immunological state of the organism is an important factor in the development of IBD. The most important cells appear to be helper lymphocytes Th (Th1, Th2,and Th17) and T-regulatory (T-reg) cells. The polarization between Th1 or Th2 depends on the cytokine profile produced as an effect of the microorganism which is recognized by MAMPs (microbe-associated molecular patterns). An imbalance between Th17 cells (promote tissue inflammation) and T-reg cells (suppress autoimmunity in IBD), which are differentfrom CD4+ T-cells, contribute to IBD [ 28 24 The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, produced by macrophages, monocytes, and T cells, has a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The transfer of immune cells, particularly T cells, to the intestine is essential for initiating and maintaining immune responses, making it a critical factor in the development of IBD [ 18 Mucin production in the colonic mucosa in response to inflammation is regulated by many factors, such as growth factors, microbes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, toxins, and neuropeptides. Interleukin-10 and its receptors are expressed on various immune cells, allowing IL-10 to efficiently regulate innate and adaptive immune responses. Interleukin-23 plays a pivotal role in disease development, and the development of selective IL-23-targeted therapies represents key components of personalized medicine [ 29 30 31 3. Probiotics and Their Beneficial Potential in IBD Control of inflammatory pathways can be achieved through various strategies such as pharmaceutical treatments, lifestyle modifications, and dietary adjustments. The long-term use of pharmacological interventions in current IBD treatments, such as drugs, corticosteroids, amino-salicylates, anti-TNF agents, anti-integrins, calcineurin inhibitors, immunosuppressants, biologics, and antibiotics, is accompanied by side effects, including digestive problems, immune suppression, diabetes, kidney damage, hypertension, weight gain, and an increased risk of infections. Surgical intervention treatment of IBD can lead to complications such as intestinal perforation, pelvic infection, and massive bleeding [ 32 33 34 35 36 Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that benefit the health of the host by favorably altering the gut microflora after oral intake in adequate amounts [ 37 38 39 Probiotics, or beneficial live microorganisms, have shown promise in prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases by promoting balance in the intestinal microbiota and increasing its diversity and composition, thereby contributing to the prevention or reduction of dysbiosis [ 40 Probiotics have the potential to maintain a healthy intestinal environment through interaction with the immune system and microbiota, which could be essential in preventing the development of IBD [ 41 Patients with IBD experience significant disruptions in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, characterized by a significant loss of microbial diversity and the development of dysbiosis [ 42 F. prausnitzii A. muciniphila, Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus E. coli Clostridioides difficile 43 These changes affect key functions of the gut microbiota, including the synthesis of beneficial metabolites such as SCFAs, disruption of the intestinal barrier, increased permeability, and promotion of the translocation of microbial products such as lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), which exacerbate mucosal inflammation and immune activation [ 44 45 Probiotic interventions targeting the gut microbiota may help restore microbial homeostasis and reduce systemic effects in patients with IBD. Histamine-degrading probiotic bacteria such as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Limosilactobacillus reuteri 46 47 48 Animal and human studies show that probiotics can have a key and preventive effect on the modulating immune and inflammatory mechanisms; however, the exact mechanisms are not yet well defined [ 49 50 51 4. Probiotic Molecular Mechanism of Action in IBD Taking probiotics provides an alternative that restores the balance of intestinal microbiota and shifts the balance from a pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory one. These are the most commonly available strains used as probiotics all of which have beneficial health effects applied alone or in combination [ 52 53 Bifidobacterium Enterococcus faecium Lactobacillus strains Saccharomyces boulardii Bacillus Pediococcus The general mechanism the action of probiotics focuses on two main aspects: 1. Altering the composition and function of the gut microbiome; 2. Supporting the physiology and immunobiology the intestinal mucosa to promote an anti-inflammatory response and facilitate wound healing. The beneficial effect of probiotics includes the following molecular mechanisms: (a) Production of SCFAs, especially butyrate and stimulatory signaling proteins; (b) Formation of immunoglobulin A; (c) Reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; (d) Induction production of anti-inflammatory cytokines; (e) Increased expression of mucin-2; (f) Increased autophagy and upregulation of defensing [ 8 54 The mechanisms of action of probiotics include increased adhesion of healthy probiotic bacteria to intestinal mucosa, inhibition of pathogens adhesion to the mucosal surface, competitive exclusion of pathogenic microorganisms, enhancement of the epithelial barrier function, and modulation of the immune function. The beneficial mechanisms of probiotics like L. reuteri B. longum E. coli L. reuteri B. longum E. coli L. reuteri B. longum E. coli E. coli 55 L. plantarum 56 Probiotics facilitate microbial diversity through competitive exclusion; probiotics compete with dysbiotic and pathogenic species for the receptor present in the gastrointestinal tract. Although regulatory elements and their associated specific pathways are largely unknown, some of the proposed mechanisms include the creation of an acidic environment to reduce competition, competing for nutritional sources, and producing of bacteriocins or bacteriocin-like substances for elimination of pathogens. Probiotics and SCFAs maintain gut health. The gut has a delicate balance between the beneficial bacteria that release vitamins and harmful microbiota that secrete toxic substances. Probiotics and fibers contribute to the stabilization of beneficial microbiota which, in the colon, ferments proteins and fibers to produce SCFAs. Short chain fatty acids are the key signaling molecules in enterocytes and are an important source of their energy; absorbed SCFAs also stimulate cell surface receptors in several other tissues via entry into the systemic circulation. By increasing the production of SCFA, they can lower the pH of the intestinal environment, thereby inhibiting the growth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. SCFAs promote intestinal secretion of the hormones such as polypeptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and increase satiety by interacting with G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 41 and GPR43 [ 57 57 Some probiotics increase the integrity of the mucosal barrier, thereby normalizing intestinal permeability [ 58 59 Probiotics suppress intestinal inflammation through several mechanisms targeting toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling, including downregulation of TLR expression and secretion of metabolites that inhibit extracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α) or through the inhibition of NF-κB responsible for inflammatory cytokine expression in enterocytes. Other mechanisms by which probiotics suppress inflammation include the suppression of IL-12 production by the host cells [ 60 61 5. Randomized Clinical Trials on the Use of Probiotics in Ulcerative Colitis The Pubmed and Scopus databases were used to summarize randomized clinical trials in humans (children and adults) on the use of probiotics in ulcerative colitis [ Table 1 Table 2 More differentiated results are noticeable within patients-based studies.

Recent evidence demonstrates potential links between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In addition, bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and host mitochondria may modulate intestinal inflammation. It is important to highlight that in addition to probiotic, prebiotics, synbiotics, and dietary supplements (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids) improve the integrity of tight junction, reduce systemic inflammation, and thus provide protection against IBD progression. They could open up new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating IBD severity in people with IBD [ 107 108 109 Table 1 Table 2 Eubacterium hallii Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Roseburia Akkermansia muciniphila Bacteroides fragilis ijms-26-09065-t002_Table 2 Table 2 CD—Randomized controlled trials (adults, children).

[ 103 CD in remission-pediatric study Lactobacillus rhamnosus Probiotics vs. placebo Relapse (PCDAI > 30 points) was 31% in the LGG group and 17% in the placebo group. LGG as a supplement did not prolong the time to relapse in children with CD. [ 104 CD in remission Lactobacillus rhamnosus Probiotics vs. placebo Relapse was defined as an increase in CDAI > 100 points. Time to relapse was 16 weeks in LGG the group and 12 weeks in the placebo group. LGG had shown no benefit in inducing or maintaining remission in CD.

Conclusions In summary, IBD is a very complex disease and the direct causes and pathomechanisms are not fully understood. IBD-related conditions appears to dependd on many factors, including genetic background, environmental, immunological, and microbial factors. Despite the availability of a wide range of biological and molecular targeted therapies, the failure rate of primary and subsequent treatments of IBD remains high. The development of new therapeutic targets and calibration of current therapies is crucial to improve efficacy, safety, and tolerability. The mechanism of the therapeutic effect of probiotics in IBD is based on repair of the intestinal barrier, regulation of the balance of the intestine, and modulating the intestinal immune response. Differences in probiotic benefits between CD and UC may be due to the different extent of lesion and immune-mediated pathophysiology in the two conditions. More RCTs are needed in the future to investigate and validate the efficacy of individual probiotic strains and combined probiotic applications in IBD. The preventive use of probiotics in individuals who are susceptible to IBD should be considered and the mechanism and course of action of probiotics should also be better understood.
