Disruptions in systemic or local iron homeostasis, whether due to overload or deficiency, have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of a broad range of anterior and posterior segment ocular disorders. Iron deficiency may compromise retinal bioenergetics, impair cellular repair, and increase susceptibility to oxidative stress, while iron overload facilitates the generation of reactive oxygen species, contributing to lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. Dysregulated iron metabolism has been associated with several ocular pathologies, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, retinal detachment, cataracts, and anemic retinopathy. The eye possesses specialized iron regulatory mechanisms involving proteins such as transferrin, ferritin, ferroportin, and hepcidin that govern iron transport, storage, and export across ocular barriers. Aberrations in these pathways are now recognized as contributing factors in disease progression. This narrative review explores the complex dual role of iron overload and deficiency in ocular diseases. It highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying iron-mediated pathologies in both the posterior and anterior segments of the eye, along with the clinical manifestations of iron imbalance. Current therapeutic approaches are discussed, including oral and parenteral iron supplementation for deficiency and emerging chelation-based or antioxidant strategies to address iron overload, while highlighting their limitations. Key challenges remain in developing targeted ocular delivery systems that optimize bioavailability and minimize systemic toxicity. Hence, maintaining iron homeostasis is critical for visual function, and further research is needed to refine therapeutic interventions and clarify the mechanistic role of iron in ocular health and disease. iron eye retina cornea lens aging iron deficiency iron overload chelation National Institute of Health R01-EY031008 The financial support from the National Institute of Health (R01-EY031008) is kindly acknowledged. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Iron is one of the most abundant elements on Earth and plays a crucial role in numerous physiological processes. It serves as a key component of enzymes involved in critical metabolic functions, including oxygen transport, cellular energy production, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication [ 1 2 1 3 Iron in the retina functions as both an essential element for physiology and a potential contributor to the pathological conditions when dysregulated. Iron exists in two oxidation states, ferrous (Fe 2+ 3+ 4 5 6 7 8 Dietary intake is the primary source of systemic iron for the body, present in heme and non-heme iron forms. Heme iron, derived from animal sources, is absorbed more efficiently in the duodenum compared to non-heme iron found in plant-based products and iron-fortified foods [ 9 10 10 2+ 3+ 11 Figure 1 3+ 10 12 3+ 3+ 2+ 12 2+ 13 14 14 15 10 2+ 10 2+ 3+ 10 10 10 16 10 10 2+ 17 3+ 18 3+ 19 When this tightly controlled system is disrupted, whether due to impaired iron import, excessive storage, or defective export, pathological consequences ensue, including lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, inflammation, cell death, or neuronal and vascular damage in the retina. Iron-dependent cell death, or ferroptosis, has emerged as a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of various retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma, in which iron overload contributes to the degeneration of RPE, PR, and vascular endothelium [ 20 21 22 23 6 7 24 25 26 27 2. Methodology A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed and ScienceDirect, using the keywords ‘iron’, ‘eye’, ‘deficiency’, and ‘overload’. Articles published within the last 15 years were prioritized to ensure inclusion of recent findings; however, earlier studies were also included to provide critical background or mechanistic insights. During screening, duplicate articles, non-English publications, and articles without full text availability were excluded. Studies deemed irrelevant to ocular iron metabolism and pathology were also removed. Findings from the remaining articles were synthesized into a narrative review of the literature. In evaluating the literature, when available, priority was given to human studies over animal or in vitro experiments. The strongest evidence base was derived from randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies, followed by smaller observational studies, case series, and case reports. Experimental and animal models were included primarily to provide mechanistic insights when human data were limited, as well as to highlight preclinical findings with translational potential. Reviews and meta-analyses were used to contextualize the evidence, summarize consensus, highlight discrepancies, and identify gaps in knowledge. In evaluating individual studies, factors such as sample size, methodological rigor, and relevance to ocular iron metabolism were carefully considered.

Ocular Disorders Associated with Iron Accumulation 3.1. Overview Iron accumulation, whether arising from genetic or acquired factors, may have distinct implications for ocular health. Primary iron overload includes systemic iron-loading inherited disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and aceruloplasminemia (ACP), leading to iron accumulation in various tissues. In contrast, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), and Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) involve neuronal dysregulation at cellular or mitochondrial level classified as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) or mitochondrial Fe-S cluster disorders respectively [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 29 The principal mechanism of iron-mediated ocular injury is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction. Excess ferrous iron (Fe 2+ 2 2 55 20 22 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 Beyond oxidative stress, iron overload also activates inflammatory pathways in retinal cells, particularly through NF-κB and inflammasome signaling. Oxidative stress mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, leads to nuclear translocation of NFκB, inducing the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL1-β, and IL-6. Further, chronic release of cytokines contributes to vascular dysfunction, which are commonly observed features in DR and glaucoma [ 63 64 38 65 60 66 67 Another crucial mechanism is ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death characterized by ROS-driven lipid peroxidation. Excess iron depletes intracellular glutathione (GSH), a critical antioxidant that compromises glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity, further driving lipid peroxidation mediated ferroptotic cell death. Accumulating evidence implicates ferroptosis in retinal ganglion cell loss, RPE and PR degeneration, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of RP [ 59 68 69 23 70 71 Furthermore, iron overload promotes the formation of new abnormal blood vessels known as angiogenesis, a major cause of vision loss in advanced DR and wet AMD [ 72 73 74 75 76 57 3.2. Genetic Iron Overload Hereditary hemochromatosis Table 1 28 29 30 The most prevalent mutation in the HFE gene, C282Y, results from a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at position 282, leading to impaired regulation of iron uptake by reducing the interaction of HFE with ß2-microglobulin and TfR1, and a subsequent decrease in hepcidin levels [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration 39 40 40 41 77 77 39 42 Aceruloplasminemia 2+ 3+ 43 44 45 78 46 47 48 Friedreich’s Ataxia 49 50 51 52 79 53 80 54 3.3.

Ocular Manifestations Associated with Iron Deficiency 4.1. Overview While the detrimental effects of iron accumulation on ocular health have been extensively documented, the implications of iron deficiency on eye diseases have received comparatively less attention in ophthalmic research. Iron deficiency is prevalent in various clinical scenarios, particularly among individuals experiencing acute or chronic blood loss (like in surgery, trauma, menstruation), inadequate dietary intake (notably in vegan and vegetarian diets), and impaired intestinal absorption (as observed in conditions like celiac disease and gastritis), making a comprehensive medical history crucial for identifying individuals at risk [ 158 159 160 4.2.

Review of Potential Treatments for Iron Disturbances 5.1. Therapeutic Approaches for Iron Accumulation There are currently no approved treatments for ocular iron overload, and systemic iron chelators such as DFO, DFX and DFP are not indicated for eye diseases due to potential side effects, particularly with DFO. Although iron dysregulation is implicated in multiple ocular conditions like AMD, DR, RD, and RP, available therapies remain disease-specific rather than targeting iron directly. In systemic iron overload such as HH, phlebotomy or systemic chelation is standard, but these approaches lack validation in ocular disease as described in Table 6 Iron chelators function by binding excess iron, facilitating its excretion, and thereby reducing iron-induced oxidative stress. This is crucial as iron catalyzes the Fenton reaction, leading to the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals [ 172 173 174 175 176 177 The iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) is a hexadentate siderophore derived initially from Streptomyces pilosus 178 81 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 Deferiprone (DFP) is a bidentate iron chelator that forms a stable 3:1 complex with ferric iron. Limited preclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated that DFP reduces retinal iron levels and oxidative stress, particularly in mouse models deficient in ceruloplasmin and hephaestin, two proteins essential for systemic iron export [ 192 193 194 195 196 197 N 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 61 210 nutrients-17-02964-t006_Table 6 Table 6 Summary of current knowledge on the clinical utility of iron chelators for ocular diseases [ 61 81 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 Iron Chelators Literature Evidence in Ocular Tissue Clinical Utility Principal Risks Systemic chelators (DFO, DFX, DFP) Preclinical Not approved for ocular iron chelation DFO: Ocular toxicity, growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities, pulmonary toxicity, susceptibility to infections SIH Preclinical Not approved for ocular iron chelation Risk of cellular toxicity, iron depletion Fenofibrate Preclinical Not approved for ocular iron chelation Gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle pain, rash Lactoferrin-loaded contact lenses Preclinical Not approved for ocular iron chelation No currently recorded risks in the literature 5.2. Therapeutic Approaches for Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency remains the most prevalent cause of anemia globally, affecting populations in both high- and low- resource countries. Management strategies for iron deficiency include dietary counseling, oral iron supplementation, and, when necessary, parenteral iron administration through intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes [ 29 Dietary counseling focuses on evaluating and optimizing a patient’s nutritional intake to enhance iron consumption. Dietary iron exists in two primary forms: heme iron, primarily found in animal-derived foods, and non-heme iron, which is present in plant-based sources. Heme iron is more efficiently absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract due to its higher bioavailability. In contrast, non-heme iron exhibits lower absorption efficiency and is more susceptible to dietary inhibitors [ 29 9 Table 7 Table 8 Oral iron supplementation remains the first-line treatment for iron deficiency due to its cost-effectiveness, safety profile, and widespread availability. Iron is commonly administered as inorganic salts, particularly sulfates, though organic iron complexes are also available. Supplement formulations may be provided as either ferrous or ferric salts. Among these, ferrous salts such as ferrous gluconate, ferrous sulfate, and ferrous fumarate, as summarized in Table 9 212 213 214 215 Iron absorption from oral supplements is influenced by several dietary components and other micronutrients. Vitamin C (ascorbate) is well recognized for enhancing iron bioavailability. It acts as an electron donor converting ferric iron to its more absorbable ferrous form through duodenal ferrireductase and facilitating uptake through DMT1 [ 216 217 218 219 219 Conversely, several dietary factors are known to inhibit iron absorption. Phytates and polyphenols, commonly found in coffee, cocoa, and red wine, bind non-heme iron and form insoluble complexes, thereby reducing its bioavailability [ 220 221 222 223 nutrients-17-02964-t009_Table 9 Table 9 Most common oral ferrous iron formulations. Adapted from Ning and Zeller 2019 [ 224 Compound Formulation Elemental Iron Content (mg) Reference Ferrous gluconate Tablet, 240 mg 27 [ 215 Ferrous sulfate Tablet, 325 mg 65 [ 215 Ferrous fumarate Tablet, 324 mg 106 [ 215 In cases where dietary counseling or oral iron supplementation proves ineffective, or in instances of severe iron deficiency, IV iron therapy is generally indicated. Older methods of IV iron preparations such as high-molecular weight iron dextran carried a significant risk of anaphylaxis with common adverse effects like skin discoloration and headaches, and thus historically necessitated a test dosing [ 225 55 226 227 228 It is critical to avoid excessive iron supplementation as discussed in the section on iron overload. Surplus iron can lead to localized or systemic toxicity, particularly in individuals with compromised iron metabolism due to genetic predispositions. Animal studies have demonstrated that excessive dietary iron may contribute to oxidative stress and photoreceptor cell death [ 229 230 N 231 232 233 6. Conclusions and Future Directions Iron is indispensable for ocular physiology, supporting oxygen transport, mitochondrial energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, and, notably within the eye, visual cycle enzymes and phototransduction. Maintaining systemic and local iron homeostasis is therefore crucial for ocular health, and dysregulation in either direction in the form of iron overload or iron deficiency has been implicated in a spectrum of anterior and posterior segment ocular disorders. Iron overload, robustly documented in both clinical and experimental settings, promotes oxidative stress through the Fenton reaction and has been associated with AMD, DR, retinal detachment, and retinitis pigmentosa. Pathological accumulation may arise from primary causes such as HH and ACP or from secondary causes including transfusion-dependent anemias, excessive supplementation, or other iron-loading conditions. Conversely, although less extensively studied, iron deficiency has also been associated with ocular pathologies, including anemic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion, blue sclerae, and presenile cataracts. Table 10 For iron overload, existing systemic iron chelators are not clinically approved for ophthalmic use, and their lack of ocular specificity and systemic distribution present major pharmacokinetic and safety challenges for direct ocular application. Developing tissue-specific, retina-penetrant chelators that selectively modulate ocular iron levels without perturbing essential metal homeostasis is a high-priority therapeutic objective. To this end, mechanistic studies should further delineate pathways such as ferroptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory signaling, and dysregulation of iron transport proteins in both anterior and posterior segments. Emerging strategies such as nanoparticle-based delivery systems, prodrug formulations, and liposomal encapsulation offer potential to improve ocular bioavailability and reduce systemic toxicity and have shown promise in preclinical studies, warranting further clinical evaluation. Conversely, for iron deficiency, dietary modification emphasizing iron-rich foods, preferably those containing heme iron sources due to their superior bioavailability, and oral iron supplementation are the first-line measures indicated for high-risk populations, such as individuals with vegan diets, chronic blood loss, intense physical activity, or eating disorders. Parenteral iron therapy is reserved for severe deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, or oral intolerance. Infection or chronic illness can precipitate functional iron deficiency further, commonly referred to as anemia of chronic disease. Consequently, a comprehensive medical history is essential for identifying and addressing the underlying etiology, which is critical for effective management and restoration of iron balance. Despite advances in understanding iron-related treatment strategies, substantial challenges remain. Oral iron therapy is often limited by gastrointestinal adverse effects that can reduce patient compliance. Moreover, the long-term safety of systemic iron repletion, particularly intravenous formulations, on retinal structure and function requires further clinical evaluation, especially in vulnerable populations at risk for AMD and other retinal diseases. Continued research with parallel priorities, including identification of reliable in vivo biomarkers of intraocular iron status and oxidative stress, will enable earlier detection and precise monitoring of iron-related ocular pathology. Delineating the roles of micronutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D in modulating iron metabolism in the eye and investigating genetic variants that may modify individual susceptibility require further exploration. Integrating genetic screening into clinical practice may thus enable individualized treatment strategies in diverse populations. Longitudinal clinical studies with large-scale cohorts are needed to establish causal relationships between systemic iron status and ocular disease progression. In conclusion, a nuanced mechanistic understanding of iron homeostasis in ocular diseases, coupled with development of targeted, well-tolerated interventions, will be vital to advance care for iron-related eye diseases and to preserve vision across the lifespan.

This table summarizes various iron-associated systemic and ocular disorders along with corresponding main evidence from clinical reports and/or preclinical models. It highlights ocular implications and the current limitations in understanding the role of iron in ocular pathology. Preclinical studies include animal models, cell culture and experimental studies whereas clinical studies include case reports, clinical trials and postmortem analysis of human patients. Both clinical and preclinical indicate evidence from both human and animal studies. Note that mechanistic clarity, translational gaps and therapeutic efficacy remain underexplored in many cases. Disorder Main Literature Evidence Ocular Clinical Implications and Limitations Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) Preclinical mouse models (Hfe, Hjv, Hepcidin, Ferroportin knockout mice) Retinal pathology may exhibit variable ocular expressivity Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN) Both clinical and preclinical studies Retinal degeneration commonly observed but with phenotypic variability in ocular symptoms Aceruloplasminemia (ACP) Both clinical and preclinical studies Iron-induced retinal degeneration occurs but early ophthalmic assessment is critical due to delayed and non-specific visual symptoms Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) Clinical reports Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to ocular pathologies but no evidence on the direct contribution of iron in ocular pathogenesis Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) Preclinical mouse models (rd10, rd1) Progressive vision loss and blindness is well-established but there is lack of clinical studies assessing retinal iron homeostasis and its role in RP progression Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Preclinical diabetic models Iron may accelerate retinal damage but lack clinical evidence if iron accumulation is a cause or consequence of DR Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Preclinical mouse models Iron accumulation noted in AMD retina, but causality is unclear. Iron chelation therapy is under investigation Retinal detachment (RD) Preclinical mouse models Iron-induced photoreceptor death, and neurotoxicity occurs but clinical evaluation of iron chelation therapy is lacking Subretinal hemorrhage (SH) Preclinical mouse models Iron toxicity from hemorrhagic breakdown may worsen retinal damage but lack direct mechanistic evidence implicating iron toxicity in SH-related retinal pathology Ocular Siderosis Both preclinical and clinal reports Lack of optimal clinical iron chelation dose, timing, delivery route and safety Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome (HCS) Clinical reports Misdiagnosis as HH and unnecessary phlebotomy Dry eye disease (DED) Preclinical animal models Iron induced ocular inflammation and oxidative stress occur but there is lack of human studies linking iron and DED Corneal iron deposition lines (CIDL) Clinical case reports Correlational clinical findings but lack animal models currently Anemic Retinopathy (AR) Both clinical and preclinical reports Exhibit retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots but no clinical studies on the therapeutic utility of iron supplements in preventing AR Retinal Vascular Occlusion (RVO) Clinical reports Variable expressivity in iron deficiency anemia patients indicating iron deficiency may be a compounding factor but not a primary driver of RVO Optic Nerve Changes Both clinical and preclinical reports Reversible with iron therapy in iron deficiency anemia patients but not replicated in preclinical models Conjunctival Pallor Clinical cases Indicator of anemia but less sensitive for iron deficiency Blue Sclerae Clinical cases Indicator of severe iron deficiency anemia.
