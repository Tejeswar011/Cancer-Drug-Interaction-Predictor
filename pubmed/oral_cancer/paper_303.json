A significant proportion of HNC patients undergo radiation therapy (RT) as part of their treatment regimen. However, the oral and throat regions of these patients are often exposed to radiation, resulting in a high incidence of oral mucositis (OM). Research by Trotti et al.  1  1 The development of OM significantly increases pain levels in HNC patients and profoundly affects their quality of life (QoL).  2  3 Additionally, OM can lead to mouth ulcers and open wounds, increasing the risk of infection. SOM may cause bacterial, fungal, or viral infections,  4 Despite growing awareness, effective prevention and management of OM remain a persistent challenge in cancer care. Adequate prevention and treatment by healthcare professionals can potentially reduce the severity of radiation-induced OM, alleviate patients’ pain and discomfort, prevent malnutrition and infections, enhance treatment compliance, and thus improve patients’ QoL and treatment outcomes. Guideline for the management of treatment-induced OM published by Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) recommend the use of mouthwashes or photobiomodulation to prevent OM in patients with HNC, with topical 0.2% morphine mouthwash to alleviate pain associated with OM.  5  6  7 8 11 This scoping review aims to investigate the roles of clinical pharmacists and nurses in managing adverse reactions among HNC patients, particularly OM. It seeks to summarize existing research, highlight evidence-based practices, and explore opportunities for optimizing pharmacist- and nurse-led care for OM in clinical settings.

Quality assessment The quality assessment was independently conducted by two researchers simultaneously, with the final results being consolidated and any discrepancies resolved. The quality scores of the included studies ranged from 5 to 8. Specifically, four studies scored 5, one scored 6, five scored 7, and two scored 8. The average scores for the assessment questions were as follows: Question 1 had an average score of 2 ± 0; Question 2 had an average score of 1.33 ± 0.49; Question 3 had an average score of 1.42 ± 0.79; and Question 4 had an average score of 1.67 ± 0.49. The overall average quality score of the 12 studies was 6.42 ± 1.16, indicating generally high methodological quality. Data extraction results The national backgrounds of the 12 studies were extracted, representing five countries: China, Turkey, Japan, Sweden, and the USA. The 12 included publications focused on the prevention or treatment of OM in patients with HNC. Of these, eight publications were randomized controlled trials, two were retrospective studies, and two were cohort studies. The basic information of the 12 extracted publications, as filtered and shown in Excel, is presented in appendix document, the document summarizes the study methods, participants, interventions, indicators, and outcomes. Summary of research indicators The extracted indicators included QoL ( n n n n n n n Seven evaluation metrics utilized 12 different scoring tools: five categories of tools were used to assess QoL, two were used for the Pain Index, two for OM scoring, one for assessing Xerostomia, two for evaluating Nutritional Status, and additionally, two studies employed the “Oral Assessment Guide” developed by Eilers et al. to evaluate the overall oral health of patients, it includes eight categories: voice, swallowing, lips, tongue, saliva, mucosa, gums, and teeth or dentures.

Assess patient pain four times within 24 h. After pain control, assess once every 24 h. Record pain scores, radiation sessions, and OxyContin doses. Establish a pain care chart documenting pain characteristics, location, timing, medication, and nursing interventions. Patients take 10 mg OxyContin orally, adjusting the dose according to pain relief until significant alleviation. Provide standardized pain management intervention with analgesics Oxygen and ultrasonic nebulization: Xu et al.  24 Nurses 1. Undergo daily oxygen or ultrasonic nebulization after radiotherapy. The medications used are 10 ml saline, 240,000 U gentamicin, 4000 U trypsin, 5 mg dexamethasone, with an oxygen flow rate of 8 L/min for 20 min each session until the end of radiotherapy Classification of results based on study objectives Eight studies implemented preventive measures for OM. The results of two studies demonstrated that these preventive measures significantly reduced the severity of OM in the experimental group, as well as improved medication adherence and QoL in these patients. 17 25  22  25  17 Three studies focused on symptomatic interventions. Results from one of these studies showed a notable improvement in the QoL of the experimental group patients. Research by Fujii and others demonstrated that post-intervention, the incidence of Grade 2 or higher OM significantly decreased, and there was a significant improvement in patients’ QoL.  21 OM interventions led by clinical pharmacists Three studies were primarily led by clinical pharmacists. In a retrospective study conducted in 2022 by Fujii et al.,  20  25  21 Clinical care led by nurses In nine studies where nurses were the principal investigators, the nurses provided patient education prior to the commencement of oncologic treatments, implemented standardized pain management interventions, assessed nursing outcomes after completing supportive care, and conducted follow-ups. The results of a randomized controlled trial conducted by Hu et al.  18  26  28  17 Discussion During the treatment of HNC, the incidence rate of OM ranges from 59.4% to 100%. In addition to the damage to normal cells caused by conventional RCT, other risk factors contribute to a higher incidence rate of OM in HNC patients compared to other types of cancer. These factors include tumor location, cumulative radiation dose, radiation field, radiation technique, and concurrent CT, all of which influence the incidence of OM.  29 An assessment of the current management status of OM as an adverse reaction in cancer patients reveals a high incidence rate, yet the management protocols remain incomplete. Existing practice guidelines are updated infrequently and contain numerous recommendations, which may complicate the standardization of care. Generally speaking, OM interventions are conducted by specialist doctors, nurses, and stomatologists. MASCC/ISOO guideline recommends the implementation of a multi-drug combined oral care program for HNC patients receiving radiotherapy to prevent OM. Patients receiving moderate-dose radiotherapy (<50 Gy) and concurrent radiotherapy with CT are advised to use Benzydamine mouthwash (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug type mouthwash) to prevent OM. For patients undergoing radiotherapy alone, low-level laser therapy is recommended. Additionally, the guideline suggests using 0.2% topical morphine mouthwash for managing pain related to OM. Alongside mouthwash for pain relief, the guideline recommends the use of two natural substances to prevent OM inflammation in patients with HNC. The MASCC/ISOO Guidelines for the Management of OM offer a comprehensive synthesis of existing research.  5 The guidelines recommend various treatment methods that require the involvement of professional clinical pharmacists to address patient medication issues. However, the role of pharmacists in this area is rarely emphasized. In the three pharmacist-led studies examined in this scoping review, pharmacists provided patients with nutritional counseling, delivered pain education, elucidated adverse drug reactions, facilitated patients’ understanding of pain, actively managed side effects, and alleviated tension and anxiety related to pain through the use of promotional videos and verbal presentations. However, these studies failed to address key areas such as comprehensive pharmaceutical monitoring by clinical pharmacists, personalized pharmaceutical care, and routine medication education for patients. Additionally, there appears to be a lack of clarity regarding the delineation of responsibilities between pharmacists and nurses in clinical settings, with nurses often assuming roles in medication education and personalized pharmaceutical services. Therefore, it is imperative for clinical pharmacists to clearly define and formalize their roles within the clinical process and diligently execute their clinical tasks accordingly. Studies have shown that when pharmacists provide medication advice, even if the types of medications do not change, pharmacist-guided medication significantly benefits rational drug use and can impact health outcomes.  30  31 This study is the first to conduct a scoping review summarizing the prevention and targeted care of OM in patients undergoing CRT for HNC over the past 15 years. It emphasizes that supportive care provided by pharmacists and nurses in clinical practice benefits patients. Currently, OM remains an underestimated side effect of cancer treatment. The data regarding OM induced by RCT are predominantly derived from adverse event reports in cancer treatment-related studies, with a paucity of large-scale study data. The data utilized in this study are largely estimated frequencies based on the outcomes of relevant research. Furthermore, a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in 2019 compared the severity assessment scores of RCT-induced OM across different regions, revealing significant differences in incidence rates.  32  30 MASCC/ISOO established a mucositis research section in 1998 to address this important issue. Clinical practice guidelines published in 2004 recommended oral care protocols, including patient education, to mitigate the severity of mucositis caused by CT or radiotherapy.  33  34  5 In the 12 studies we analyzed, several studies involved pharmacists and nurses providing basic oral care to patients in the intervention group. These interventions resulted in reduced pain, lower OM grades, improved QoL, reduced incidence of OM, lower xerostomia scores, improved nutritional status scores, and reduced incidence of esophagitis. Although this study did not include large sample trials or standardized scoring tools, it preliminarily indicates that multidisciplinary team oral basic care involving pharmacists and nurses can help cancer patients achieve optimal treatment experiences and outcomes. From the research results, it is evident that SOM during cancer treatment significantly disrupts treatment progression. In the study by Yüce and Yurtsever,  17  25 However, this scoping review has several limitations, such as the small sample size (551 patients in the experimental group and 395 in the control group) and regional constraints, including China, Turkey, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. Representation from these countries is insufficient, making it challenging to accurately reflect the clinical practices of pharmacists and nurses more. The norms and responsibilities of pharmacists vary significantly among these countries. Moreover, the study did not account for several confounding factors, including the impact of patients’ dietary habits, as immune responses play a crucial role in the OM development following radiation-induced cell damage. High consumption of pro-inflammatory foods (such as saturated fatty acids, fried foods, and added sugars) can induce chronic inflammation, while low intake of fruits and vegetables increases the risk of DNA damage in cells.  29  35  36  37 35 38 39  40 Conclusion In the management of HNC, effective prevention and management of OM during CRT are crucial for enhancing patient outcomes. Clinical pharmacists and nurses play indispensable roles within the multidisciplinary treatment team by leveraging their expertise and skills to provide optimized therapeutic strategies and comprehensive care support for patients. The direct care model employed by pharmacists and nurses significantly alleviates symptoms and enhances the QoL for patients, thereby fostering improved treatment efficacy and patient satisfaction.
