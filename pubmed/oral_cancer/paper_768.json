Vaccines that induce drug-sequestering antibodies have shown promise, but their efficacy is hindered by the poor immunogenicity of small-molecule haptens. Adjuvants, substances that enhance immune responses, are critical for overcoming this limitation and improving vaccine efficacy. This review synthesizes over two decades of preclinical and clinical research to guide rational adjuvant design for SUD vaccines. Five major adjuvant classes are examined: aluminum-salt adjuvants, emulsion adjuvants, toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, protein immunopotentiators, and cytokine modulators. Their physicochemical properties, innate immune activation profiles, and applications in nicotine, stimulant, and opioid vaccines are discussed. Comparative analyses reveal pronounced drug-specific and carrier-specific variability. Case studies illustrate the superior performance of a complementary TLR-agonist pair in a nicotine nanovaccine versus its limited effect in oxycodone vaccines. They also reveal the differential efficacy of an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant across antigen types. Four principles emerge: (i) no adjuvant is universally optimal; (ii) drug pharmacology influences immune signaling; (iii) adjuvant-carrier compatibility is important; (iv) complementary adjuvant pairings often outperform single agents. These insights support a precision-vaccinology paradigm that tailors adjuvant strategies to each drug class and the delivery vehicle, advancing the development of next-generation SUD vaccines. vaccine adjuvant substance use disorder aluminum salt emulsion adjuvant toll-like receptor agonist protein-based adjuvant cytokine modulator precision vaccinology nanoparticle vaccine opioid vaccine United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) 5UG3DA048775-02 Department of Biological Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech This work was funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), under award number 5UG3DA048775-02, and by the Department of Biological Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic mental health condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking and continued use despite harmful consequences [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Despite decades of research, treatment options remain limited. For OUD, medications that include methadone, buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone represent the cornerstone of evidence-based care [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 In light of these limitations, active immunotherapy has emerged as a compelling alternative. Unlike small-molecule antagonists that compete for receptor occupancy [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 Among all formulation variables (hapten structure, carrier protein, dosing schedule), the choice of adjuvant has proven highly influential [ 53 54 55 56 57 Figure 1 58 59 60 61 62 E. coli 63 A comprehensive understanding of these variables is now critical for advancing next-generation SUD vaccines from bench to clinic. Therefore, this review has three aims. First, it catalogs the principal adjuvant categories, including aluminum salt-based adjuvants, emulsion adjuvants, TLR agonists, protein adjuvants, and cytokine modulators, employed across SUD vaccine candidates. Second, it summarizes the efficacy of these adjuvants across different drug targets, highlighting through comparative data how their efficacy can vary substantially depending on the substance. Third, it explores the underlying mechanisms that may account for this variability, highlighting the roles of drug-receptor interactions, immune signaling pathways, and adjuvant physicochemical properties. Collectively, this precision-adjuvant perspective provides insights for rational adjuvant selection, advocating that tailored adjuvant strategies are indispensable for the development of effective vaccines against SUDs. To clarify scope, this review provides in-depth analysis for vaccines against nicotine, cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioids, where adjuvant-focused vaccine studies enable meaningful cross-study comparisons. In contrast, alcohol and cannabis currently lack a sufficiently developed adjuvant literature to support the same level of analysis. For alcohol, the physicochemical properties of ethanol (e.g., very small, poorly immunogenic) have limited progress with vaccine development [ 64 65 66 2. Adjuvant Platforms in SUD Vaccinology This section provides an overview of the major adjuvant platforms that have been explored in the development of vaccines targeting SUDs. These platforms include traditional aluminum salt-based adjuvants and emulsion-based adjuvant systems, as well as strategies such as toll-like receptor agonists, protein-based adjuvants, and cytokine modulators. For each adjuvant class, we summarize chemical composition, mechanisms of action, and the immunological profiles observed in both preclinical and clinical studies. By highlighting the breadth of adjuvant technologies and their unique immunostimulatory properties, this section sets the stage for understanding how adjuvant selection can profoundly influence the immune efficacy and translational success of SUD vaccines. 2.1. Aluminum Salt-Based Adjuvants Aluminum-salt (Alum) adjuvants, including formulations based on aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate, are the most widely used vaccine adjuvants to date [ 67 68 69 68 70 71 × 4 y 68 72 73 74 75 76 Alum’s long clinical history and manufacturing simplicity make it the default starting point for the development of new vaccines. A summary of SUD vaccines employing Alum adjuvants is provided in Table 1 KLH 77 78 4 79 co 80 81 82 While Alum adjuvants remain an appealing choice for initial vaccine development because of their regulatory acceptance and cost, their immunological profile is limited and may not be sufficient to confer broad or robust protection against all drug targets [ 85 86 87 2.2. Emulsion-Based Adjuvants Emulsion-based adjuvants are typically oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O) formulations that enhance immune responses by creating antigen depots and stimulating innate immune activation [ 56 88 89 90 69 91 92 93 94 95 A growing body of evidence supports the use of emulsion-based adjuvants in vaccines targeting SUDs. Key emulsion-adjuvanted formulations and their performance across SUD targets are outlined in Table 2 96 97 Pseudomonas 98 In addition to Freund’s adjuvant, the other emulsion adjuvants have also been explored in vaccines against SUDs. Moreno et al. evaluated six structurally distinct METH haptens using SAS to develop an effective vaccine [ 99 100 101 2 2 103 104 197 Emulsion-based adjuvants offer versatility and have established safety profiles in licensed vaccines [ 105 2.3. Toll-like Receptor Agonists Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that serve as the primary sensors of innate immunity. They recognize distinct structural motifs related to pathogens or components of host cells released during cell damage, often referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), respectively [ 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 The application of TLR agonists across nicotine, opioid, and stimulant vaccine platforms is detailed in Table 3 49 113 114 115 116 62 117 118 119 para 120 197 121 122 KLH 123 In addition to TLR agonists, protein-based adjuvants have garnered increasing attention in recent years as distinctive immunostimulatory agents. While protein-based adjuvants often interact with TLRs (e.g., flagellin is a TLR5 agonist) [ 124 2.4. Protein-Based Adjuvants Protein-based adjuvants represent a versatile and mechanistically rich class of immunostimulatory agents. They are often derived from microbial proteins, bacterial toxins, or synthetic protein constructs engineered to engage the immune system [ 125 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 Several protein-based adjuvants have been investigated in vaccines targeting SUDs. Representative examples of protein-based adjuvants used in SUD vaccine research are listed in Table 4 136 E. coli E. coli 63 84 137 138 Although protein-based adjuvants are less frequently employed, their modularity, safety profiles, and dual functionality as both carrier and adjuvant make them attractive candidates for future translational research. Their ability to engage innate immunity while minimizing inflammatory toxicity aligns with the growing demand for well-tolerated vaccine platforms in vulnerable populations [ 125 139 140 2.5. Cytokine Modulators Cytokines are small, secreted proteins that play a central role in cell-to-cell communication and the regulation of immune responses [ 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 Although many cytokines have been approved as therapeutics and are being actively investigated as adjuvants in immunotherapies for cancer and infectious diseases [ 159 160 161 Table 5 162 163 164 Other cytokine pathways have not been explored in SUD vaccine studies, but some cytokines’ immunomodulatory roles suggest potential applications. For instance, IL-21 supports Tfh and germinal center responses and can improve antibody affinity [ 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 Altogether, the classes of adjuvants discussed (aluminum salts, emulsions, TLR agonists, protein-based adjuvants, and cytokine modulators) comprise a diverse and mechanistically rich toolkit for strengthening vaccine-induced immunity against SUDs. Each platform offers unique advantages, ranging from the regulatory familiarity of Alum to the tailored immune polarization achievable with cytokine modulation. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of a given adjuvant is not universal. As emerging data reveal, identical adjuvants can produce divergent outcomes depending on the target drug, hapten structure, and immunological context. These observations underscore the importance of understanding not only how adjuvants work, but also when and for which drug targets and/or delivery system they work best. In the following sections, we explore the sources of this variability, integrating comparative study results and mechanistic insights to uncover why certain adjuvants succeed in one context yet falter in another. 3. Variability of Adjuvant Performance Across Drug Classes Although the immunostimulatory properties of adjuvants are well established in immunotherapies against cancer or infectious diseases, their performance in SUD vaccines has been notably variable. In this section, we examine evidence from published studies revealing that adjuvants do not elicit consistent immune responses across different drug targets and delivery systems. Vaccines targeting different drugs and using different delivery vehicles often respond differently to the same adjuvant formulation, producing divergent outcomes in terms of antibody titers, affinity, and functional protection. These findings advocate systematic or head-to-head comparisons of adjuvants and drug-specific optimization strategies, as assumptions based on success in one context may not translate to another. Rather than searching for a default or universal solution, adjuvant selection in SUD vaccine development requires careful validation within each drug class. Several studies have compared the effects of different adjuvants within the same vaccine platform. For instance, Zhao et al. evaluated the efficacy of different TLR agonists and their combinations in the context of a nanoparticle-based nicotine vaccine (NanoNicVac) [ 49 178 80 In another striking example, emulsion-based adjuvants exhibited similarly divergent performance depending on the target drug and the delivery platform. Madge et al. investigated several designs and adjuvant strategies for fully synthetic, peptide-based anti-cocaine nanovaccines [ 102 4 39 103 179 Although cross-study interpretation was performed to identify patterns in adjuvant performance, several methodological limitations should be acknowledged. Small animal models were commonly used. Sample sizes were often limited, and several studies included only one sex. Behavioral endpoints varied, and few studies conducted head-to-head adjuvant comparisons within matched vaccine backbones. To improve comparability, core immunogenicity outcomes should be prespecified, including antibody titer, affinity, isotype distribution, and, if feasible, Tfh and germinal center indices. Functional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures should be included to link antibody responses with drug sequestration and behavior. Behavioral endpoints and assessment windows should be standardized, and sample-size justification should be provided. When feasible, adjuvants should be evaluated using the same carrier, hapten, and dosing schedule. The next section will explore the mechanistic underpinnings of the divergent outcomes highlighted above. First, we will examine why the TLR agonist pair MPLA + R848 markedly enhanced the immunogenicity of NanoNicVac, consider how Alum may compromise nanocarrier integrity, and analyze why the same MPLA + R848 combination failed in an oxycodone formulation built on the same platform. Second, we will evaluate why MF59 outperformed Freund’s adjuvant in a peptide-based cocaine vaccine yet showed limited benefit in an oxycodone conjugate vaccine, where Alum and Freund’s adjuvant proved more effective. By exploring these case studies, our aim is not to prescribe a formulaic, substance-specific adjuvant solution but rather to distill practical principles that can guide the rational optimization of adjuvant formulations. 4. Mechanistic Insights Linking Drug Biology to Adjuvant Efficacy In addition to acknowledging adjuvant variability, mechanistic insights help guide the design of new formulations and predict which immunological barriers a given substance may present. Here, we explore several expanded dimensions of drug-adjuvant and carrier-adjuvant interaction. Zhao et al. demonstrated that a nanoparticle-based nicotine vaccine formulated with MPLA + R848 achieved exceptional potency in terms of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic outcome [ 49 Figure 2 180 181 182 183 184 Hu et al. reported that aluminum salt compromised the structural integrity of NanoNicVac [ 178 185 186 80 The MPLA + R848 adjuvant combination that elicited the highest immunogenicity in NanoNicVac did not replicate its effect in the oxycodone vaccine evaluated by Walter et al. [ 80 187 Figure 2 188 189 190 191 192 Building on the comparative efficacy data presented above, we now explore the mechanistic traits that underline MF59’s context-dependent performance. As illustrated in Figure 3 93 193 194 195 196 + + + 95 197 198 102 In comparison, the oxycodone conjugate vaccine OXY(Gly) 4 + 69 76 199 200 201 + Figure 3 39 103 179 139 202 203 204 Taken together, these mechanistic insights suggest that an adjuvant’s immunomodulatory action should bypass immune pathways suppressed by the target drug and compensate for the antigen’s remaining immunogenic deficits. Co-encapsulation of MPLA and R848 in a nicotine nanovaccine significantly improves immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic efficacy. However, the same adjuvant strategy fails for opioid vaccines as opioids blunt TLR4 signaling, rendering MPLA ineffective. In the other example, MF59 is advantageous when rapid leukocyte recruitment and Tfh expansion are needed, as in vaccines based on short peptides or self-assembling lipopeptides. Nonetheless, it offers little added value when a hapten carrier already supplies abundant T cell help. For opioid vaccines formulated by conjugating haptens to a strongly immunogenic protein carrier, adjuvants that provide a physical depot, such as Alum and Freund’s adjuvant, currently appear better suited. Beyond drug pharmacology and adjuvant mechanisms, variability across platforms often arises from how the delivery vehicle engages innate immune sensing. In nanoparticle-based systems, particle size and interfacial chemistry influence key processes such as lymphatic trafficking, depot formation, and the presentation of danger signals [ 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 Evidently, adjuvant performance in SUD vaccines is best interpreted as conditional on both drug biology and formulation context. Findings with strong support include MF59 enhancing leukocyte recruitment and Tfh support for peptide or lipopeptide constructs and CpG in combination with Alum improving antibody response in several stimulant and nicotine models. Effects that vary by context include reduced utility of TLR4 agonists in opioid settings and limited added value from MF59 when carrier proteins already provide strong T cell help and antigen persistence is the limiting step. Positive synergies are most likely when antigen and innate cues are co-localized and mechanistically complementary rather than duplicative. Because most evidence is preclinical and head-to-head evaluations within identical backbones remain uncommon, these conclusions should be treated as evidence-weighted patterns rather than universal rules. To support context-specific adjuvant selection in SUD vaccine development, Figure 4 5. Translational Barriers for SUD Vaccines Human trials with nicotine and cocaine vaccines showed that immunization was able to elicit measurable anti-drug antibodies, yet clinical benefit was inconsistent and largely confined to participants who achieved higher and more durable titers. Phase 3 nicotine programs with 3′-AmNic-rEPA (NicVAX®, NCT00836199 NCT00969878 52 60 84 212 Trial design choices compound this challenge. Endpoints have varied widely, from biochemically verified continuous abstinence in nicotine studies to thrice-weekly urine benzoylecgonine testing in cocaine studies [ 60 84 Behavioral context is equally important. Partial blockade can prompt some individuals to escalate drug use to overcome antibody binding, which erodes apparent efficacy and may increase risk [ 38 213 Ethical and social considerations shape both trial conduct and real-world adoption. Voluntary participation should be explicit, with use in justice or correctional settings limited to opt-in models that avoid coercion or perceived compulsion [ 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 Practical considerations influence feasibility. Adjuvant selection affects both immunogenicity and tolerability, and certain formulations introduce additional chemistry, manufacturing, and control requirements. Programs should standardize reactogenicity monitoring, plan for lot comparability, and assess cost-effectiveness for prevention and relapse-prevention use cases, with ethical implementation emphasizing voluntary participation, transparent consent, realistic expectation setting, and attention to access and equity [ 38 221 222 6. Conclusions and Future Directions Adjuvant incorporation is often the determinant that converts a modest anti-drug immunogen into a viable vaccine candidate. More than twenty years of preclinical and clinical studies on vaccines against SUDs reveal several recurring principles. First, no adjuvant exhibits universal efficacy. For instance, one formulation that performs well against nicotine or cocaine may prove inadequate against opioids. Second, drug chemistry and pharmacology directly influence immune outcomes. For example, opioids that attenuate TLR4 signaling can diminish the potency of TLR4-targeted agonists such as MPLA. Third, structural compatibility is essential. Alum can destabilize lipid-shelled nanocarriers. Finally, yet importantly, combination or self-adjuvating platforms consistently outperform single agents when they co-activate complementary pathways or co-localize antigen and danger signals within the same molecular scaffold. Co-encapsulation of MPLA and R848 within the same nanoparticle platform enables NanoNicVac to achieve greater efficacy than formulations with a single adjuvant. These principles are supported chiefly by preclinical evidence. Within the smaller human literature, efficacy signals have been confined to higher-titer subgroups and overall results have been mixed. In addition to these design principles, adjuvant selection should match the delivery route and the intended immune compartment ( Figure 4 Precision adjuvant selection can be put into practice through parallel, standardized head-to-head screenings conducted within matched vaccine backbones for each target drug class. A common data frame should include antibody titer, affinity, isotype distribution, and, if feasible, Tfh and germinal center indices. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic readouts that link antibody profiles to drug sequestration and behavior should be captured. These data can then be combined with predictive biomarkers to guide regimen choice and boosting. For example, baseline IL-4, innate transcriptional signatures, and early titer or affinity data can identify likely responders. Prespecified immunogenicity thresholds can trigger adaptive booster timing and composition. Because many preclinical and available clinical trials did not report sex-stratified outcomes or were not powered to detect them, sex should be considered a limitation of the current evidence base and a prespecified variable for future studies. Attention to platform and adjuvant compatibility is equally important. Design-of-experiments evaluation of adsorption, release, stability, and depot behavior with the intended carrier should be routine. Pairings known to be incompatible, such as alum with fragile lipid-shelled particles, should be avoided. Clinical translation is strengthened when composite endpoints are prespecified that pair clinical outcomes with immunologic and pharmacologic targets (e.g., anti-drug IgG concentration and affinity targets, an isotype pattern linked to efficacy, and a predefined reduction in plasma drug exposure after a standardized challenge). Manufacturing scale-up, lot comparability, and reactogenicity monitoring appropriate to each adjuvant class should be planned prospectively. Enrollment and analysis plans that allow sex-stratified reporting when adequately powered improve interpretability. Implementation is expected to be most effective when vaccination is accompanied by behavioral therapies and, when appropriate, pharmacotherapies, with voluntary use, transparent consent, realistic expectations, and attention to access and equity.

( a + + b + Figure 4 Decision framework for rational adjuvant design in SUD vaccines. The schematic outlines key decision points in the design of SUD-targeted vaccines, organized by the addictive substance targeted, the delivery platform, and the route of administration. Each design layer influences the immune context and adjuvant requirements. For instance, hapten–protein conjugates usually have strong T cell help and may benefit from depot-forming adjuvants that promote antigen persistence. Nanoparticle platforms allow co-delivery of antigen and adjuvants but require careful evaluation of carrier-adjuvant compatibility. Self-assembling peptide vaccines often require additional adjuvant support (e.g., MF59) to enhance Tfh and germinal center responses. Intramuscular delivery with MF59 can elicit chemokine bursts via ATP release, while mucosal strategies with dmLT or LTA1 support IgA induction.
