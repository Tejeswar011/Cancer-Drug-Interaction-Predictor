Increased frequency and intensity of smoking elevate the vulnerability to oral cancer. Salivary biomarkers & oral cancer Salivary biomarkers including total protein, amylase, cytokines and amino acids are identified as promising indicators for diagnosing and prognosticating oral cancer. The study emphasizes the importance of these biomarkers in predicting patient outcomes. Elevated salivary total protein levels Oral cancer patients display significantly higher salivary total protein levels compared with healthy individuals. Salivary protein concentration may serve as a useful measure for oral health status and disease detection. Reduced amylase activity in tobacco consumers Tobacco users exhibit lower salivary amylase levels, while oral cancer patients show elevated levels. Suggests complex interaction between tobacco use, cancer development and enzyme activity. Role of inflammation Salivary TNF-α expression is significantly higher in oral cancer patients than in healthy controls and tobacco consumers, indicating its potential role as an inflammatory biomarker. Significant increases in amino acids Notable upregulation of various amino acids in oral cancer patients, highlighting changes in salivary amino acid profiles associated with the presence of disease. Reinforces the notion that certain amino acids could serve as diagnostic indicators for oral cancer. Cysteine as a key biomarker Increased cysteine levels are observed in the saliva of tobacco consumers, suggesting a protective response against acetaldehyde-a cancer-causing agent related to tobacco use. Cysteine's elevation may indicate both the progression of oral cancer and the body's adaptive response to harmful substances. Potential for noninvasive diagnostics Salivary biomarkers, particularly cysteine, hold promise for noninvasive diagnostic and therapeutic applications in managing and detecting early stages of oral cancer. Further research is needed to explore their diagnostic and therapeutic potential in the context of oral cancer.
