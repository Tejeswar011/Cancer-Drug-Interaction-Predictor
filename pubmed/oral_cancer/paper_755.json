Herein, prepuberty, puberty, and maturity were investigated using anogenital distance, vaginal opening, first estrus, reproductive hormone profiles, cyclicity, sexual behaviour and pregnancy outcomes to assess the impact of exposure to arsenic and/or graphene oxide on the puberty of offspring female rats after maternal exposure during gestation and lactation periods. Zero-day pregnant Sprague Dawley females were randomly divided into four groups, each receiving a different treatment via drinking water from gestation day 0 to postnatal day 21: control group (CON, drinking water); arsenic group (ARS, 10 mg/L sodium arsenite); graphene oxide group (GOX, 0.5 mg/mL); and co-exposure group (ARS + GOX; 10 mg/L of arsenic combined with 0.5 mg/mL of graphene oxide). Individually or combined, arsenic and graphene oxide exposure increase the sexual retardation and female masculinization, as evidenced by a significant increase in anogenital distance, delay in the first estrus cycle, and prolongation in the timing of the vaginal opening. At maturity, the offspring exhibited a significant elevation of testosterone and a significant decrease in estradiol. Offspring females showed inhibited receptivity to their male mates, indicated by lower lordosis quotient and intensity. Additionally, there was an increase in the number of estrous cycles but a decrease in their duration. Moreover, an increase in implantation loss and the number of resorbed embryos, along with a reduction in viable fetuses. In conclusion, reproductive deterioration was more significant in the offspring exposed to combined arsenic and graphene oxide compared to those exposed to ARS or GOX alone, indicating that arsenic exposure is exacerbated when combined with graphene oxide during the experimental episode. sodium arsenite nano-graphene oxide puberty anogenital distance vaginal opening estrous cycle sexual behaviour The authors received no financial support from any organization or authority for this research. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Co-exposure to various environmental pollutants, whether natural or anthropogenic, is an increasing concern that poses significant health risks to humans, which are significantly exacerbated by the prevalence of nanomaterials [ 1 2 Arsenic (ARS), a heavy metal, is one of the most ubiquitous metalloids and environmental toxicants, with a pervasive existence in drinking water, foods, and soil from various sources. Smelting, refining, and mining activities are also common anthropogenic sources of arsenic deposition, increasing environmental contamination [ 3 4 Arsenic, despite its well-known toxic effects in humans, has been extensively documented in the scientific literature as affecting or contributing to alterations in developmental parameters, particularly through its elevated concentrations in human blood serum. Moreover, toxic exposure to arsenic has increased in recent years, partly due to the intensified environmental and dietary exposure to this metalloid [ 5 The capability of arsenic to cause toxicity is well known in acute and chronic exposure, causing numerous disruptions. Indeed, research has clearly documented that arsenic is a potent endocrine disruptor with a high affinity to cross and accumulate in tissue barriers, such as hypophysis–pituitary–gonads, blood–gonads, blood–placenta, and blood–breast [ 6 7 8 9 10 Confirming this, it has been shown that arsenic exposure disturbs levels of reproductive hormones, leading to an irregular estrous cycle in female rats [ 11 12 13 14 Extensive use in modern applications, such as bioremediation, biomedicine, electronics, and the agricultural industry, has triggered the significant release of graphene oxide (GOX) into the environment. Toxicologically, this emission of graphene oxide may pose a threat to human health and the ecosystem [ 15 16 Few studies have investigated graphene oxide (GOX) nanotoxicity data; these have mainly been conducted on mammals, amphibians, zebrafish, and fungi. An accumulating number of reports have demonstrated that graphene oxide can interact with biological macromolecules, such as nucleotides, proteins, and polysaccharides, resulting in substantial risks in tissues and organs [ 17 18 19 20 21 Aqueous aggregation processes can significantly impact function, effective toxicity, environmental transport, and fate of advanced nanoscale materials, including graphene and graphene oxide (GOX) [ 22 The present study focuses on the impacts of the significant prevalence of arsenic in drinking water and the occupational exposure to graphene oxide on the reproductive system. It aims to assess the potential effects of arsenic coexisting with graphene oxide on the developmental puberty in female offspring through a simulated experimental approach to environmental exposure. This study hypothesizes that the findings will provide valuable insights into the combined effects of the nano-graphene oxide and arsenic toxicity on the prepuberty, puberty, and maturity of female offspring during gestation and lactation. 2.

Ethics Statement All the experimental protocols of Animal Use, Care and Welfare were certified and supervised by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the Faculty of Science (IACUC), Alexandria University (Serial Number: AU04/605/a26-8-25). The experimental procedures strictly adhered to the Good Laboratory Practice Guidelines and the applicable animal welfare legislation set forth by the OECD [ 29 30 2.5. Animals Fetch Sixty 90-day-old (150–170 g weight) adult nulliparous female rats and thirty 80-day-old (140–160 g weight) proven-fertile male rats of the Sprague Dawley strain from a breeding stock colony were provided by the Centre of Animal Husbandry (Rearing Animal Centre) of the Faculty of Agriculture, Alexandria University, Chatby, Alexandria, Egypt. The animals are housed in polypropylene cages with absorb-dry and care fresh bedding and maintained under-ventilated controlled conditions (24 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 10% humidity, and a cycle of light/dark (on/off 07.00) with free access to chow food and water ad libitum. There was no evidence of disease after gross inspection of both female and male rats. Female and male rats were acclimated and quarantined for two weeks. 2.6. Mating and Pregnancy Layout For preparation of the mating experiment, nulliparous female rats cohabited with males (2 females/1 male/cage) and received free food and drinking water ad libitum. Females were timed at zero days of gestation (GD0) on detection of sperm plugs in the vaginal cervix. Following the mating, the positively inseminated females were individually housed in separate cages for the treatment protocol [ 31 2.7. Experimental Assignment and Design Zero-day pregnant Sprague Dawley females were indiscriminately allocated into four experimental groups ( n Pregnant females were individually housed in cages; the exposure occurred between GD1 and GD20 and was maintained throughout the lactation period (postnatal day 21, PND 21). The intrauterine period (GD1 to GD20) corresponds to the development of the hypothalamus and sexual differentiation in rats. Only neonatal female pups from each litter were kept for lactation until weaning on postnatal day 21. Following weaning, two weaned female offspring per littermate were randomly assigned and separately housed in individual cages ( n 32 2.8. Experimental Milestones Maternal Toxicity Monitoring The start and final maternal body weights, neurotoxicity, behaviour, and physical toxicity (hair loss, bleeding, aggression, and diarrhea) were registered as significant symptoms of maternal toxicity. 2.9. Female Offspring 2.9.1. Measurement of Body Weight and Anogenital Distance On postnatal day 1 (PND 1), female offspring from each group were weighed. Measurements of anogenital distance (AGD) were taken using a digital vernier calliper by applying the procedures described by Gallavan et al. [ 33 2.9.2. Determination of Location and Count of Nipples and Areolae On PND 15, the mean number of nipple buds (teats) of female offspring ( n 34 2.9.3. Estimation of Onset of Puberty Vaginal Opening, First Estrus, and Ovulation From pre-puberty days (PND 21–29), weaned female offspring from control and experimental groups were checked daily at 7:00 a.m. for the start of vaginal opening (VO). Under macroscopical examination, VO is fully gaping, and the tissues are swollen, moist, and reddish pink with visible longitudinal indentations in the dorsal and ventral lips of the vulva [ 35 36 2.9.4. Scrutiny of Reproductive Cycle (Estrous Cycle) (Maturation Phase) Starting from the first ovulation and for 15 days (PND 75–90), the four phases of the estrous cycle were estimated via a collection of vaginal smears. Briefly, each phase of the estrous cycle (proestrus/estrus and metestrus/diestrus) was indexed by the basic criteria (proportion, density, and arrangement) of three exfoliated cell types in vaginal smears (keratinized cells, leukocytes, neutrophils, and nucleated epithelial cells). Thereafter, the status of the cycling index (length, frequency, contiguity) and the duration of each phase were determined [ 37 2.9.5. Assessment of Lordosis and Sexual Receptivity At sexual maturity (PND 90), only cycling females from each group were acclimated and habituated for one estrous cycle on an inverted light cycle (12 h light/dark) with food and water ad libitum for 5 days preceding the sexual behaviour test. Copulatory behaviour (lordosis) and receptivity were assessed following four hours of proestrous rats. Females are individually paired with vigorous stud and sexually adapted male rats in a Plexiglas observation cage during the day dark phase (10.00–12.00 p.m.) [ 38 2.9.6. Test of Natural Mating for Fertility and Reproductive Performance All fertility tests and reproductive performances complied with the protocol of Housing, Caring and Mating Laboratory Animals [ 39 n 2.9.7. Assessment of Body, Ovary, and Uterus Weights at PND 90 The remaining female offspring ( n 2.9.8. Reproductive Hormone Assays For hormonal analysis, the blood samples were collected from the dorsal aorta in the same estrus phase and centrifuged at 2200× g 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data was fed to the computer and analyzed using the IBM SPSS software package version 20.0. (Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Corp.). The significance of the results obtained was judged at the 5% level. The data was presented as Mean + Standard Deviation (SD). A one-way ANOVA test was used to analyze the statistical differences within groups. Normally distributed quantitative variables (F-test, ANOVA) were applied, and the post hoc test (Tukey) was applied for pairwise comparisons. To determine if a sample of data comes from a normal distribution, the Shapiro–Wilk test is used. It assesses the normality of a dataset by comparing the observed data to the expected values of a normal distribution. The test calculates a W statistic that ranges from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit to a normal distribution. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed, and the test determines if there is enough evidence to reject this hypothesis. In this test, a high p p p 3. Results 3.1.

Maternal Toxicity No obvious signs of unusual behaviour were recorded during GD1 to GD20, or the lactation period, compared with the control group. None of the pregnant female rats aborted between GD1 and GD20. No female rats were excluded from the study protocol. No differences in pregnancy duration or number of delivered offspring between the control and ARS-exposed groups were recorded. However, at weaning, a significant decrease in body weight was observed among experimental groups compared with the control group ( Figure 2 3.3.

Sexual Behaviour and Receptivity of Female Offspring The ARS, GOX, and ARS + GOX cycling female rat offspring at proestrus presented significant decreases in mean lordosis frequency to 28%, 19%, and 39%, respectively, compared with the 98% frequency of lordosis of the control female offspring. Similarly, the lordosis intensity of the females that responded to the mounting of experienced stud males was decreased to 48%, 41%, and 73% for ARS, GOX, and ARS + GOX cycling female offspring, respectively, compared with the 4.25% intensity of lordosis of the control cycling female offspring ( Figure 5 Figure 5 3.3.5.

Discussion Notably, the rise in global exposure to environmental toxicants validates the occurrence of co-exposure to ARS-GOX, posing significant threats to public health. The developing crucial organs—and, subsequently, full growth and development—are extremely sensitive to xenobiotics or toxicants, particularly in utero and during lactation. This study simulates real environmental conditions to investigate the adverse effects in utero and during lactation exposure to ARS and/or GOX on the reproductive axis of female rat offspring. During pregnancy and lactation, maternal exposure to ARS and/or GOX through drinking water induced maternal toxicity, as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight, which in turn led to prepubertal defects in offspring, without adverse effects on behaviour, pregnancy, or parturition. ARS and GOX individually disrupted pubertal parameters, including AGD, vaginal opening, first estrus, reproductive hormones, and cyclicity. When combined, these environmental toxicants exacerbated reproductive disorders through complementary mechanisms. The results highlight the significance of the environmental risks associated with the co-exposure of females to toxics and nanomaterials. Numerous reports have suggested that nanoparticles enhance the toxicity of toxicants by boosting their uptake and bioavailability [ 43 44 45 46 Despite no changes in the number of nipples, ARS and/or GOX alone increased AGD, referring to masculinization in female offspring [ 47 Delayed puberty onset was frequently observed in the ARS and/or GOX exposure groups, while the most significant effects were evident in the co-exposure group. This delay may be associated with placental dysfunction and trophoblast cell damage, suggesting that the synergy of ARS and GOX may exacerbate impaired fetal development by altering maternal metabolism and, consequently, remodelling or reprogramming fetal development trajectories [ 48 49 50 The combined mechanism of high binding affinity to the estrogen receptor α (ERα) [ 51 52 53 54 55 56 Furthermore, in utero, the direct estrogen-interfering and endocrine-disrupting mechanism may increase the expression of genes responsible for regulating estrogen and estrogen receptors, which are involved in suppressing the pre- and post-pubertal development of the mammary gland [ 57 58 59 60 61 62 According to the detection of GOX in gametes, transferring nanoparticles to the offspring could explain the damage to the genitals of the offspring [ 63 64 Further possible molecular mechanisms behind the reduction in ovarian steroids may be related to lowering CYP17A1 CYP17A1mRNA expression in theca-interstitial cells [ 65 66 67 68 69 The succession of the estrous cycle was significantly disrupted, as evidenced by the alterations in the frequency of the metestrus and diestrus stages, the increase in the number of cycles, and the decrease in cycle length observed in the present findings. Indeed, cycle disruption and irregularity are indicative of hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad disorders, a downregulation of steroidogenic genes, a degeneration of ovarian cellularity, and delayed follicular maturation induced by arsenic toxicity [ 70 71 72 The toxicity of ARS is exacerbated or aggravated in co-exposure with GOX, significantly more than with ARS or GOX alone, suggesting that GOX could boost ARS toxicity via synergistic effects. The triggered toxicity of ARS may also be related to the oxygenic functionality of the surface area and endocytosis-mediated cellular internalization of GOX [ 73 74 75 76 Compared to the control group, offspring in the co-exposure group showed a significant reduction in pregnancy rates and the number of live births. Nanoparticles caused a decrease in fertilization rates and live birth numbers, and an increase in implantation loss [ 77 78 79 Understanding the environmental fate and transport of GO is complicated by its possible physical and chemical variations. In water, GOX tends to develop wrinkles and ripples to minimize the total free energy [ 80 81 82 83 Therefore, the current findings suggest that the exacerbated effects of GOX can be attributed to the crucial interplay between its physical properties (crumpling and ζ-potential) and its chemical characteristics (carboxyl functional groups). Together, these factors significantly enhance the aqueous stability of GOX, whereas reductions in GOX have been shown to lead to much faster aggregation kinetics at lower ionic strengths. 5. Conclusions The present findings systematically unravel the toxic effects of combined ARS and GOX on prepuberty, puberty, and maturity parameters. The perturbations observed in the current study were more significant in the combined-ARS-and-GOX offspring after maternal exposure during the gestation and lactation periods compared with those in offspring exposed to ARS or GOX alone. Although the natural interactions between ARS and GOX may be more complex, the present findings reveal the possible role of GOX in exacerbating female prepuberty in combination with ARS in perinatal and lactation periods. The observed adverse effects of arsenic and graphene oxide, whether alone or in combination, should be regarded as indicative of potential reproductive risks in humans, particularly under conditions of chronic or elevated exposure. However, species-specific differences in toxicokinetics, metabolism, and susceptibility may influence the degree of risk. Thus, our results should be interpreted as supportive experimental evidence rather than direct predictors of human outcomes. We believe that our findings highlight a pressing need for further studies, including mechanistic research in human-relevant models and well-designed epidemiological investigations, to better establish human health risk assessment and safe exposure thresholds. Limitations of the Study Although the present study provides important insights into the reproductive toxicity of arsenic and graphene oxide in female rats and their offspring, we expand on several limitations in this Limitations of the Study section to clarify the key constraints. Specifically, we acknowledge the following: High Dose Levels: The doses of arsenic and graphene oxide administered in this study were relatively high compared to typical environmental or occupational exposure levels. While this approach is valuable for identifying potential toxic effects and mechanisms, the findings may not directly reflect the risks associated with lower, chronic, real-life exposures. Single-Species Model: The use of female rats as an experimental model provides important information, but extrapolation to humans should be carried out cautiously. Differences in physiology, metabolism, and reproductive biology between rodents and humans may limit the generalizability of the results. Exposure Duration and Route: The exposure duration and route (oral, intraperitoneal, etc.) may not fully mimic human exposure scenarios, where chronic low-dose exposure through water, food, or inhalation is more common. This difference may influence the distribution, bioaccumulation, and toxicokinetics of arsenic and graphene oxide. Combined Exposure Assessment: While the study investigated co-exposure to arsenic and graphene oxide, the design may not capture the full complexity of interactive effects at lower, environmentally relevant concentrations. The observed toxicity could be amplified by the supraphysiological doses used. Limited Mechanistic Exploration: Although the reproductive endpoints of offspring puberty and maturity were assessed, mechanistic insights at the molecular and cellular levels (e.g., oxidative stress pathways or epigenetic modifications) were not comprehensively investigated. Such analyses would be valuable for clarifying the underlying basis of the observed effects. Long-Term Offspring Outcomes: The assessment of offspring was limited to early developmental and reproductive parameters. Long-term effects across the lifespan, including transgenerational impacts, were not evaluated and remain to be determined. In addition, the present study aimed to investigate the prepubertal, pubertal, and maturity endpoints of female offspring, which was conducted only in early developmental stages (short-term offspring outcomes). Daily intake water consumption (mg/kg/day): Noting the absence of direct estimated intake data, we recommend that future studies incorporate the daily monitoring of water consumption to allow more accurate dose–response assessment. Lack of Molecular and Histological Endpoints: A further limitation of the present study is the absence of direct molecular and histological assessments to support the proposed mechanistic pathways. While the reproductive and developmental outcomes observed suggest possible involvement of oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and neuroendocrine signalling alterations associated with puberty and maturity, these mechanisms remain hypothetical without corroborating molecular markers or tissue-level evidence. Future studies incorporating gene expression profiling, protein analyses, and histopathological examinations of reproductive and neural tissues are warranted to validate and expand upon the mechanistic interpretations suggested here. Analysis of Gonadotropins (LH, FSH): The inclusion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) would have provided a more comprehensive assessment of hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis disruption. We also highlight that future work should include gonadotropin measurements alongside sex steroid hormones to better characterize the endocrine mechanisms underlying arsenic and graphene oxide toxicity.
