Commensal microbes on the ocular surface interact with cells and molecules of the ocular surface immune system to promote immune tolerance to the normal flora of the ocular surface and facilitate immune protection against invading pathogenic microbes, which allows for a disease-free ocular surface. Various factors can impact the composition, distribution, and diversity of the ocular surface microbiome, including age, gender, disease state, antibiotic treatment, and contact lens use. In addition, there is no cohesive consensus on the species that make up the ocular surface microbes. There is, however, thorough research present on other similar mucosal membranes, such as the gut and oral mucosa, that share similarities with the ocular mucosa. Exploring the relationship of different mucosae allows us to explore treatment options for common ocular diseases such as dry eye syndrome. This review highlights studies that define the ocular surface microbiome, its diversity and composition, host–immune interactions at the ocular surface, factors that cause dysbiosis of the ocular surface microbiome, the impact of dysbiosis on the ocular surface microbiome, and microbiome-based therapy. ocular surface microbiome gut microbiome dysbiosis ocular surface immunity 16S ribosomal RNA probiotics This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Microorganisms exist throughout the human body, from the gut to the skin to the oral mucosa, and they together constitute the human microbiome [ 1 2 3 4 2 3 2 Similarly, the ocular surface microbiome (OSM) has unique characteristics that play an important role in protecting the eyes from external factors [ 1 5 6 7 8 6 5 9 5 The ocular surface microbiome is best defined by resident bacteria that do not cause inflammation or infection and live in harmony with the surrounding environment [ 4 10 11 12 The exact composition of the ocular surface microbiome has been challenging to study because it can be impacted by many extraneous factors such as age, gender, genetics, diet, and environment [ 4 13 14 4 9 15 15 Technology has advanced significantly in aiding the identification of the OSM, with the first tools being culture-dependent methods for identifying ocular surface organisms. However, next-generation sequencing techniques (16S ribosomal RNA, Shotgun metagenomics, and RNA-based metagenomic deep sequencing) have made it possible to have an enhanced characterization of the ocular surface microbiome compared to culture-based methodologies of characterizing the ocular surface microbiome [ 8 15 16 In this review, we will highlight the difference in composition of the ocular surface microbiome based on culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. It will also address the relationship between the ocular surface mucosal immune system and the ocular surface microbiome. This review will also highlight the impact of ocular surface disease and environmental factors, such as antibiotic use and contact lens wear, on the diversity and composition of the ocular surface microbiome. Moreover, the impact of gut dysbiosis on ocular homeostasis and its role in the development of ocular surface disease will be reviewed. 2. Ocular Surface Microbiome Compared to Other Mucosal Microbiomes The human body is composed of a large community of microorganisms on the epithelial and skin surfaces, including the ocular surface, urinary tract, and digestive and respiratory tracts [ 17 18 19 20 21 The gut microbiome is a vast and diverse ecosystem of microorganisms [ 22 22 23 24 25 26 The symbiotic evolution of the commensal bacteria and the host environment is mutually beneficial, as the gut provides nourishment and a reproduction site [ 27 28 29 30 29 7 31 32 33 34 It is important to understand the relationship between the gut and oral microbiome and ocular diseases, as it would aid in accurate diagnosis and provide individualized treatment and management options. Understanding the gut/ocular axis further may be useful in the development of new therapeutic interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. 3. Ocular Surface Microbiome Composition of a Healthy Ocular Surface Age, geographic location, contact lens wear, diet, topical/oral antibiotic medications, ocular surgery, infections, or other ocular or systemic disorders can greatly vary the commensal ocular flora composition [ 16 35 36 37 Initial studies aiming to characterize the ocular surface microbiome used culture-dependent techniques that failed to identify the vast variety of species represented on the OSM [ 38 39 40 41 3.1. Technological Considerations for the Ocular Surface Microbiome Conventional culture methods are limited by low microbial yield, limited diagnostic accuracy, and potentially long turnaround times for results [ 42 43 The 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology is one of the most used methods in today’s world. Unlike the gut and nasal microbiome, the ocular surface microbiome has low microbial abundance. Amplicon sequencing addresses this by enabling the selection and amplification of bacterial marker genes through PCR before sequencing [ 44 45 8 46 46 The term “next-generation sequencing” refers to modern techniques for rapid DNA sequencing methods [ 43 47 43 47 48 49 48 3.2. Bacteria Traditional culture methods have been used for a long time to characterize various microbiomes [ 50 51 52 53 The advent of molecular methods has allowed for a significantly improved and high-resolution method for detecting microbial species [ 54 55 In healthy individuals’ ocular surface, culture-independent and dependent methods have long identified Staphylococcus 3 56 Corynebacterium Acinetobacter Pseudomonas Staphylococcus Cutibacterium Table 1 57 Streptococcus 5 56 58 Pseudomonas Haemophilus Neisseria Table 1 59 Pseudomonas 16 40 60 Other recent studies have confirmed the bacterial diversity of the ocular surface microbiome and the challenges associated with its identification. Hezrog et al. [ 61 Staphylococcus epidermis Cutibacterium acnes Corynebacterium mastitidis Acinetobacter junii 61 Another recent study by Ren et al. identified Actinobacteria Lactobacillus Clostridium Helicobacter Sphingomonas 62 62 Actinobacteria 63 64 Actinobacteria Corynebacterium 65 Another study by Zhou et al. [ 66 Corynebacterium Streptococcus 66 66 In addition to different detection techniques, the method of data collection can significantly impact the test results. Chen and colleagues found that using tear test paper instead of conjunctival swabs for specimen collection led to differences in the detection of alpha and beta diversity of the ocular surface microbiome [ 67 68 Huang et al., used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology to assess the OSM of 31 adult healthy human eyes without any prior history of ocular surgery or trauma, and the use of contact lenses [ 59 Corynebacterium Pseudomonas Staphylococcus Acinetobacter Streptococcus Millisia Anaerococcus Finegoldia Simonsiella Veillonella 59 41 41 69 Corynebacterium Cutibacterium Staphylococci 41 3.3. Viruses Following bacteria and fungi, viruses account for the next majority constituents of the OSM [ 8 70 71 72 8 8 71 Table 1 8 41 4 41 + 73 8 73 3.4. Fungi It is essential to note that the microbiome of the ocular surface encompasses a diverse range of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The ocular surface microbiome consists of bacteria and fungi that are considered opportunistic pathogens. An imbalance in the ocular surface microbiome, referred to as dysbiosis, can facilitate the colonization of the ocular surface by pathogenic microbes [ 39 8 39 74 Malassezia Rhodotorula Davidiella Aspergillus Alternaria Fusarium Curvularia Penicillium Helminthosporium Setosphaeria Haematonectria Candida Choriomyces Claedesporium Saccharomyces Hormodendrum Table 1 30 75 76 Aspergillus Setosphaeria Malassezia Haematonectria 75 76 75 Aspergillus niger Aspergillus flavus 77 8 78 79 76 76 76 4. Ocular Surface Immunity and Its Interaction with the OSM The cornea, meibomian gland, conjunctiva, limbus, and lacrimal gland are components of the ocular surface [ 80 81 5 82 15 15 5 4 The conjunctiva plays an important role in immune surveillance at the ocular surface due to the presence of the epithelial layer, immune cells in the stroma, and intraepithelial lymphocytes. The conjunctival intraepithelial lymphocytes include MAIT (mucosal-associated invariant T) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD8 + 4 65 83 84 80 80 85 86 86 87 alpha alpha beta beta 88 89 90 88 88 89 90 91 91 91 83 83 82 82 82 92 4 81 4 82 82 92 93 80 93 94 15 92 81 The cornea is an immune-privileged site due to the absence of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, lack of MHC II or MHC Ia expression on corneal cells, the presence of immunosuppressive mediators, the expression of apoptosis-inducing molecules such as Fas Ligand (FasL) and programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1), and the role of regulatory T cells [ 80 81 92 93 92 93 Proteobacteria 93 95 80 96 80 The toll-like receptor (TLR) is an innate immune sensor that detects the presence of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [ 5 12 29 5 15 97 98 99 5 98 IgA-producing plasma cells in the lacrimal gland and conjunctiva produce large amounts of IgA that prevent pathogenic bacteria from binding to the ocular surface and facilitate the survival of commensal bacteria [ 100 3 3 101 15 102 103 104 105 3 105 92 15 Staphylococcus intermedius Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus 15 102 3 Corynebacterium mastitidis 16 83 97 106 Figure 1 3 5 65 92 65 107 108 109 93 93 107 110 111 80 86 Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus 4 112 Staphylococcus epidermidis 113 4 5. The Impact of Dysbiosis of the Ocular Surface Microbiome 5.1. Dry Eye Disease Dry eye disease is associated with disruption and a change in the diversity of the ocular surface microbiome and gut microbiome [ 114 115 116 117 The gut bacterial microbiome plays a vital role in the development of the immune system and in educating it to distinguish between harmful pathogenic microbes and commensal microbes. It provides defense against pathogens in the gut and enhances immunomodulation by SCFA-producing bacteria [ 12 118 116 Bilophila wadsorthia 12 119 120 12 121 120 122 123 The concept of the gut–eye axis refers to the role that gut microbiota play in modulating ocular surface immunity [ 12 115 124 116 115 116 + 116 12 125 116 Willis and colleagues suggested that an increase in the abundance of microbes under closed-eye conditions can alter the T cell subpopulation on the ocular surface, leading to the development of dry eye disease. They further suggested that under closed-eye conditions, there is a high likelihood of dysregulation of ocular surface mucosal immunity, with the consequence of increasing microbial abundance [ 126 126 126 116 116 114 114 127 128 128 129 130 131 114 132 Probiotics and prebiotics have health benefits in ameliorating several diseases associated with gut dysbiosis. It has been demonstrated that probiotics and prebiotics produce clinical benefits in individuals with dry eye syndrome [ 116 133 Bifidobacterium lactis Bifidobacterium bifidum Saccharomyces boulardii Enterococcus faecium 134 5.2. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction The meibomian glands are specialized sebaceous glands located in the upper and lower tarsal plates, responsible for secreting meibum, the lipid layer of the tear film. Proper function of these glands is essential for eye comfort and vision, whereas dysfunction can lead to dry eye disease and ocular inflammation. Altered meibum is the hallmark of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). The OSM contributes to maintaining ocular surface health by supporting microbial and immune homeostasis and modulating host immune responses to protect against pathogenic invasion [ 15 93 15 135 136 137 138 139 140 4 72 4 141 coagulase-negative Staphylococci 59 71 139 141 142 Cutibacterium 40 41 66 71 141 Corynebacterium 40 41 54 59 66 71 139 141 Staphylococcus 41 66 71 139 Streptococcus 40 41 54 66 71 141 Pseudomonas 40 59 141 Corynebacterium 59 93 140 Bacteria become attached to the tear film due to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and extracellular matrix proteins, where GAGs act as receptors for bacterial adhesion [ 4 4 141 4 143 4 71 140 Staphylococcus Cutibacterium acnes 139 140 144 Corynebacterium 144 Staphylococcus 140 136 137 140 145 5.3. Ocular Allergy Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva in response to specific allergens [ 146 ε 147 148 149 146 146 150 146 151 The OSM is influenced by various external factors that impact the ocular surface’s health and, in turn, its composition. Vincenzo and his colleagues assessed the influence of the physiological, environmental, and lifestyle factors on the OSM. They extracted DNA using the 16S RNA gene sequencing method from 135 healthy individuals [ 141 141 152 Staphylococcus aureus 153 153 154 146 Pseudomonas Corynebacterium 146 155 OSM in patients with allergic disease indicates a significant decrease in diversity and exacerbation of dysbiosis compared to healthy conjunctival flora [ 156 6. Impact of Antibiotic Treatments on the Ocular Surface Microbiome Antibiotics play a pivotal role in altering the ocular surface microbiome. Although antibiotics can treat and prevent infectious and inflammatory conditions, they can also lead to long-term, negative side effects, including increased corneal bacterial presence of certain bacterial strains [ 35 157 158 159 160 161 Antibiotic usage can cause profound changes in the microbiome within the entire body, including the ocular surface [ 162 163 164 165 166 52 54 66 141 167 168 168 35 7. Contact Lens Wear Impacts on the OSM The use of contact lenses is a well-established risk factor for the development of inflammatory conditions including microbial keratitis [ 5 169 170 5 71 170 171 171 172 4 71 Staphylococcus Pseudomonas 170 Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa 5 Multiple studies on contact lens wearers have shown that their OSM differs from that of non-contact lens wearers, with a composition more closely resembling skin microbiota—characterized by increased levels of Pseudomonas 5 16 77 172 16 Corynebacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis 14 Staphylococcus Streptococcus Corynebacterium Haemophilus Pseudomonas Acinetobacter Methylobacterium Lactobacillus 16 Methylobacterium Acinetobacter Pseudomonas Haemophilus Staphylococci Streptococcus Corynebacterium 173 Enterobacter mori Staphylococcus pasteuri Achromobacter agilis 169 Staphylococcus pasteuri 169 169 171 171 169 5 169 8. Modalities for Combating Gut Dysbiosis Modifying the gut microbiome by normalizing its microbiota may pave the path for novel therapeutics to manage various ocular diseases [ 116 174 175 176 177 Probiotics are live microorganisms that combat gut dysbiosis and possess health-promoting benefits. Some bacterial species of genera, which include Lactobacillus Bacillus Escherichia Enterococcus Pediococcus Streptococcus Leuconostoc and Bifidobacterium, 178 Figure 2 12 Figure 2 12 30 Figure 2 12 30 179 12 180 12 30 12 Lactobacillus Streptococcus Enterococcus Lactococcus Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Salmonella typhi Shigella flexneri Listeria monocytogenes pathogenic Escherichia coli Clostridium botulinum 181 182 181 Figure 2 30 Figure 2 30 183 184 Figure 2 30 179 Figure 1 30 179 Figure 2 30 184 Tavakoli et al. assessed the benefits of probiotics and prebiotics in a randomized controlled trial of 41 participants with dry eye disease and found a significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of dry eyes using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) [ 175 Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG 185 Lactobacillus fermentum 186 These studies show promising results of a novel field of research and solidify the link between gut and oral microbiome dysbiosis and the ocular surface. However, there is a need for more comprehensive studies that can aid researchers and clinicians in finding a practical and effective application of such therapeutics. These treatment options may be the answer to relieving patients’ ocular disease symptoms and improving their quality of life. 9. Conclusions The ocular surface microbiome is rich, abundant, and diverse in composition and plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and preventing pathogens from invading. In addition to the OSM, the health and dysbiosis of the gut and oral microbiome impacts the progression of ocular diseases. Environmental conditions, ocular diseases, antibiotic use, age, gender, personal habits, and contact lens wear can also impact the composition and diversity of the ocular surface microbiome. Thus, preserving the epithelial barrier function of the ocular surface, dampening the inflammatory process, and maintaining immune tolerance to the ocular surface microbiome are essential for a disease-free state. Modern technological advances, such as next-generation sequencing and high-throughput sequencing technology, are promising in allowing us to accurately find the makeup of the commensal microbes that form the OSM. Understanding the OSM and its close relationship to the gut and oral microbiome is a crucial step towards accurate diagnosis and appropriate management options. The advent of using probiotics, prebiotics, and FMT is an exciting and unique method of treatment for various ocular diseases, and eye care providers can add to as a treatment modality for severe ocular surface disease patients.
