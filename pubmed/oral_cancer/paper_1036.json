Introduction Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated uric acid levels resulting from impaired purine metabolism and abnormal uric acid metabolism [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Thus, targeting the synthesis or transport processes of uric acid represents a viable strategy for developing treatments for hyperuricemia [ 6 12 7 13 6 14 The Chinese herbal medicine ‘Bai Lian’ was first documented in the ‘Shennong Ben Cao Jing’ as the tuberous root of Ampelopsis japonica 15 16 17 18 19 2. Results 2.1. Main Active Ingredient Analysis of AJE In the present study, HPLC/Q-TOF-MS was used to quantify the components of AJE in both positive-ion and negative-ion modes throughout a retention period of 0–60 min ( Figure 1 Table 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 7 1 2.2. Intersection of the Targets Between AJE and Hyperuricemia Network pharmacology was used to examine the responsible active ingredients and mechanism of action of AJE in the treatment of hyperuricemia. Based on the screening parameters, ten active components were identified. The TCMSP database evaluated 166 component targets. After searching the Gene Cards and OMIM databases, removing duplicate entries, and taking the union of the results, a total of 1128 protein targets related to HUA were identified. Potential targets for the treatment of hyperuricemia were identified by intersecting 166 component targets with 1128 hyperuricemia-related targets to provide 61 pharmacological targets ( Figure 2 BP, CC, and MF were among the 61 important nodes that were imported into the Metascape platform for GO enrichment analysis ( Figure 2 Figure 2 2.3.

CON stood for the group of healthy mice. A mouse group dosed with 500 mg/kg/d of hypoxanthine and 100 mg/kg/d of potassium oxyzinate to produce HUA was referred to as HUA. Group for Allopurinol (All) was used as a positive treatment.

Effects of AJE on Kidney Injury in Hyperuricemia Mice The kidney size in the HUA group was significantly larger than that in the CON group ( p Figure 3 Figure S2 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.5. AJE Ameliorates HUA-Induced Renal Inflammation Excess uric acid can induce oxidative stress and inflammation in the kidney. As expected, the concentrations of multiple inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were higher in the kidney of the hyperuricemia group than those in the CON group, indicating the presence of inflammation ( Figure 4 p Figure 4 p p p 2.6. XOD Inhibitory Activity of AJE Elevated serum and liver XOD activity, a sign of metabolic stress from hyperuricemia, was observed in mice. It can also induce hepatocyte damage ( Figure S3a–c Figure 5 50 50 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.7. Serum Principal Component Analysis To understand how AJE ameliorates HUA in mice, we conducted a metabolomic analysis on blood samples using UPLC-MS/MS. The overall distribution and stability of the analysis process concerning positive and negative ions across the three data groups were evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA). The groups were distinctly separated, while the data within each group exhibited close clustering, with minimal overlap and a limited range ( Figure 6 Figure S1a,b 2.8. Screening and Identification of Potential Biomarkers The differences among the three groups of samples were evaluated using the Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) model, with results presented in Figure 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 The variable importance in projection (VIP) parameters derived from the OPLS-DA analysis were utilized to screen for differential variables between samples, thereby identifying endogenous metabolites with significant contributions.

Figure 7 ( a b c d 2.9. Metabolic Pathway Analysis Compared to the CON group, the serum levels of 115 differential metabolites in the HUA group were altered. These metabolites were subsequently imported into MetaboAnalyst for further analysis. The onset and progression of hyperuricemia primarily involve metabolic pathways, including the one-carbon pool by folate, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism ( Figure 8 Figure 8 2.10.

AJE Up-Regulated ABCG2 and Down-Regulated GLUT9 and URAT1 In addition to xanthine oxidase, several transporters play crucial roles in the metabolism of uric acid. Two key urate transporters, URAT1 and GLUT9 are primarily involved in the reabsorption of urate in the kidneys, while OAT1, OCT2 and ABCG2 are the three main transporters responsible for the excretion of uric acid. To assess the impact of AJE on these transporters, we utilized RT-qPCR to evaluate the expressions of OAT1, GLUT9, URAT1, OCT2 and ABCG2 ( Figure 10 p p p p Figure 10 p p 3. Discussion Hyperuricemia is not only defined as a disorder of purine metabolism but is also recognized as a pathogenic factor contributing to gout, kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases [ 5 20 21 Elevated XOD activity is a key driver of excessive uric acid synthesis [ 6 In our study, we adopted a comprehensive approach, integrating pharmacodynamics, network pharmacology, and metabolomics to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of AJE in improving hyperuricemia. To uncover the active constituents and pathways through which AJE exerted its effects, we analyzed its chemical composition using chemical fingerprinting and network pharmacology. AJE was found to contain a range of bioactive compounds, including beta-sitosterol, sitosterol, spinasterol, stigmasterol, (+)-catechin gallate, (−)-catechin gallate, and quercetin. These compounds were likely to constitute the active basis through which AJE mitigated hyperuricemia, thereby providing a scientific rationale for its therapeutic potential. The network pharmacology results revealed that among the key proteins targeted by AJE in the prevention of HUA, TNF, JUN, RELA, PTGS2, PTGS1, and NOS2 are closely associated with inflammation [ 22 23 α β κ 24 25 26 27 β 28 29 κ κ Based on the changes in differential metabolites and related metabolic pathways identified through metabolomics, 60 significantly differential metabolites were identified between the AJE high-dose group and the model group. Eight major metabolic pathways were obtained, including those associated with purine metabolism, energy metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation regulation, and amino acid metabolism [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 In the regulatory system of uric acid metabolism, URAT1 and GLUT9 serve as the primary transporters on the renal tubular epithelial cell membrane [ 36 37 38 39 40 26 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Reagents and Materials Hypoxanthine (≥98%, HPLC) and potassium oxonate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Allopurinol (≥99.97%, HPLC) were purchased from MedChemExpress (Shanghai, China). Xanthine oxidase (XOD) kits, creatinine kits and uric acid kits were taken from the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). The research samples were provided by our own laboratory prepared according to our preliminary research on the phytochenistry of AJE [ 41 4.2. Network Pharmacology Analysis of AJE The effective chemical components of AJE were gathered using the TCMSP ( http://tcmspw.com/tcm-sp.php http://www.megabionet.org/tcmid/ http://targetnet.scbdd.com/ https://www.uniprot.org/ https://db.idrblab.org/ttd/ http://www.omim.org/ https://www.genecards.org/ https://string-db.org/ https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ 4.3. Animals and Prevention Male SPF KM mice (18–24 g) were obtained from the Medical Experimental Animal Center of Guangdong Province (license number: SCXK (YUE) 2018-0002) and kept in a controlled environment with a 12 h light/dark cycle and a room temperature of 21 ± 2 °C, as well as regular access to food and water. All experiments were approved and conducted under the related ethics regulations of the Committee on Use and Care of Animals of the Institute of Biological and Medical Engineering, Guangdong Academy of Sciences (Guangzhou, China) under protocol number and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (US National Research Council, 1996). The ethics number is K2024-01-122. Male SPF KM mice were randomly divided into the following five groups ( n 42 20 4.4. Sample Collection Before sacrifice, all mice were fasted for 12 h. Mouse serum, liver and kidney were collected following a 7-day experiment. The blood samples were collected from the orbital plexus and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain serum for subsequent metabolomics analysis and other biochemical indicators. Simultaneously, the kidney and liver were promptly extracted and cleaned with saline. The partial tissue samples were submerged in a 10% neutral formalin buffer. Samples of liver and kidney were taken from each mouse’s left lateral and instantly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 4.5. Histological Examination After being fixed in 10% formalin solution for 24 h and embedded in paraffin, the kidney samples were sectioned (5 μm) and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E). Transmission electron microscopy was then used to examine the ultrastructure of the kidney tissue for histological evaluation. 4.6. Determination of Serum and Organ Tissues Biochemical Indicators Tissue samples from kidneys were weighed and mixed with precooled 10% saline, then centrifuged at 4 °C, 4000 rpm for 15 min. Serum levels of uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cre) were quantified using commercial kits. The supernatant was analyzed for XOD, reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, and glutathione (GSH) levels, following kit instructions. 4.7. Determination of XOD Inhibitory Activity XOD (0.05 U/mL) and xanthine (0.2 mM) were prepared and stored at 4 °C for later use. AJE was diluted to concentrations of 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg/mL with PBS. Blank and positive controls were set up using PBS and allopurinol, respectively. The assay was conducted in 96-well plates, each well containing 100 µL of the reaction mixture. According to the literature methods [ 43 Inhibition  percentage  % = [ dA / dt  blank  − ( dA / dt )  sample ] ( dA / dt )  blank , 50 The type of XOD inhibition by AJE was determined using Lineweaver-Burk kinetics, which involved measuring initial reaction rates at varying xanthine concentrations with and without the inhibitor. 4.8. Metabolomics Analysis 4.8.1. Serum Sample Preparation Serum samples were thawed on ice after storage at −80 °C. 50 μL of the sample were combined with 300 μL of extraction solution (acetonitrile:methanol = 1:4) containing internal standards in a 2 mL tube. Following vortexing for 3 min, samples were centrifuged at 300× g g 4.8.2. UPLC-QTOF/MS Analysis The AJE sample was analyzed using an LC-ESI-MS/MS system (UPLC, ExionLC AD; MS, QTRAP ® 4.8.3. Data Processing and Multivariate Statistical Analysis Metabolite data were analyzed using SIMCA 14.1 version (Umetrics AB, Umea, Sweden) for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Differential metabolites were identify with absolute Log2FC (|Log2FC| > 2) and VIP (VIP > 1). MetaboAnalyst R was used for VIP values after mean centering and log transformation. A permutation test was conducted with 200 permutations. Identified metabolites were annotated using the MetaAnalyst database ( http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/ 4.9. RT-qPCR Analysis Total RNA from the kidney was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Using the corresponding kit, 2 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA, followed by PCR amplification in the presence of SYBR Green. Primer sequences for the target genes were designed using BLAST ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi Table 3 β −ΔΔCt 4.10. Western Blot Analysis Kidney tissues were processed for protein extraction using RIPA buffer on ice, with added PMSF, followed by centrifugal separation at 300× g κ κ https://imagej.net/ij/ 4.11. Statistical Analysis The data are presented as means ± standard deviation. The differences among multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by the LSD test, with p p 5. Conclusions Administering AJE orally resulted in reduced serum uric acid and creatinine levels in hyperuricemic mice, while also mitigating kidney damage, including glomerular atrophy and tubular cell degeneration. Our study demonstrated that AJE modulates purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism, leading to decreased uric acid levels. Additionally, AJE attenuated kidney inflammation by inhibiting the Nrf2/HO-1 and TLR4/NF- κ Acknowledgments We are grateful to Hanxiang Li of South China Botanical Garden Public Laboratory for their help in using the LC/MS.
