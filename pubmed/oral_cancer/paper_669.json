We analyzed metabolites from peri‐implant crevicular fluid (PICF) samples from healthy and diseased implants to identify those diagnostic of health and peri‐implant disease and predictive of peri‐implant bone loss over time. Methods Clinical, radiographic examinations and PICF samples were collected from 59 healthy implants, 33 implants with peri‐implantitis, and 38 implants with peri‐implant mucositis in 71 subjects. A subset of implants was evaluated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

A practical model to diagnose and predict the progression of PID is lacking [ 1 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 A new strategy to approach peri‐implant disease diagnosis and prognosis is through the analysis of the metabolome in PICF. The metabolome consists of a profile of biochemical end‐products resulting from enzymatic activities in a living system. These elements or metabolites belong to a variety of compound classes, such as amino acids, peptides, organic acids, and nucleotides. Unlike RNA and cytokines, metabolites are not directly coded into the genome. Instead, metabolites are products of cellular and physiological biochemical pathways involved in energy storage, cell‐to‐cell signaling, and virulence [ 16 17 18 hypothesized aim 2 Methods 2.1 Study Design and Eligibility This study was a cross‐sectional evaluation of clinically healthy and diseased implants. Additionally, we followed a fraction of the subjects 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following baseline. Study eligibility was determined through electronic dental records search of clinic patients with at least one endosseous, rough‐surfaced root‐form dental implant and who were examined or receiving supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) in the Graduate Periodontology Clinic. The search excluded individuals who: (1) had an uncontrolled systemic disease, such as diabetes; (2) used systemic antibiotics within the previous 3 months from baseline; (3) were unable or unwilling to provide consent; and (4) had a history of periodontal or peri‐implant treatment or local antibiotic use in the past 12 months. Of the 85 eligible individuals, 14 did not consent to enter our study, resulting in a final sample of 71 subjects. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed at recruitment and after PICF sampling at baseline and at each follow‐up visit. Probing pocket depth (PPD) and radiographic bone level (RBL) were measured before analyzing the PICF samples. This study adheres to the STARD (Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) guidelines to ensure clarity, transparency, and consistency with accepted standards for diagnostic and prognostic research. 2.2 Definition of Peri‐Implant Health and Disease Peri‐implantitis (PI) was defined as an implant with a PPD ≥ 6 mm, ≥ 3 mm of RBL loss (measured from the implant‐abutment interface (IAI) to the first bone‐to‐implant contact), and bleeding on probing (BoP) or suppuration on probing (SoP) [ 1 1 neither nor 2.3 Clinical Examination At the initial screening examination, subject demographics and full‐mouth PPD, clinical attachment level measures (CAL), bleeding scores (FMBS), and plaque scores (FMPS) were recorded. Self‐reported smoking habits were recorded as current, former, or never. Clinical periodontal measurements were made at six sites per implant after PICF collection at each time point. Baseline examinations were performed by calibrated examiners (E.K., J.H., H.A., B.B., and M.C.). A Michigan‐O probe with William's markings (CP‐10 Hu‐Friedy) was placed with light to moderate pressure (0.25 N) into the sulcus of both teeth and implants to measure PPD. Around teeth, CAL measurements were taken from the cemento‐enamel junction (CEJ) or the restorative margin of teeth to the base of the pocket. All PPD and CAL measurements were rounded up to the nearest mm. To calculate FMBS, Bleeding on Probing (BOP) was assessed 30 s after probing and expressed as a percentage of the total sites. Plaque was scored as present or absent at six sites per tooth or implant by running the probe just coronal to the gingival margin. A FMPS was calculated as the percentage of tooth sites with detectable plaque. 2.4 Radiographic Measurements Bone levels around dental implants were assessed radiographically from vertical bitewing or periapical radiographs. The RBL was calculated by measuring the distance from the IAI (or the most coronal portion of the roughened implant surface if a polished collar was present) to the most apical position of the alveolar bone crest (ABC) in contact with the surface of the dental implant. Measures were made on a periapical radiograph to the nearest 0.01 mm using the ruler 1 FIGURE 1 Non‐standardized periapical radiographs showing > 2 mm RBL within a 6‐month period. Since periapical radiographs were not standardized in this trial, foreshortening and elongation must be normalized using the known length of the implant. (A) True linear RBL value was calculated on a peri‐apical radiograph by (relative RBL) × (actual implant length/relative implant length). Since patient records indicated this implant to be 13 mm then the true linear RBL is 7.83 × 13/12.98 = 7.84 mm. (B) True linear RBL value calculated on a second radiograph taken 6 months after the first radiograph in A. True linear RBL value calculated is 10.21 × 13/13.05 = 10.17 mm. 2.5 Peri‐Implant Crevicular Fluid Sample Procurement and Processing Subjects were sampled between 2 and 8 weeks following their initial periodontal examination and before any periodontal probing or SPT intervention. In each subject, PICF samples were collected from one site per implant, with a maximum of 4 implants. To avoid salivary contamination of PICF samples, all sites were isolated with a cotton roll or gauze and dried using a light stream of air from an air‐water syringe directed away from the sulcus towards the crown of the implant. Supragingival plaque was removed carefully with a curette, so as not to touch the free gingival margin and induce bleeding or push plaque subgingivally. Using cotton pliers, a thin (50 μm), porous (5 μm pores), silver membrane disc, 3.96 mm in diameter (Sterlitech [cat#AG5048]), was inserted into the sulcus or pocket at each site until resistance was met (Figure S5 All membranes were placed in separate pre‐chilled Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μL of a standardized NMR buffer solution containing 0.3 mM 2,2‐dimethyl‐2‐silapentane‐5‐sulfonate sodium salt (DSS) in phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 with 20% deuterium water (D2O), and 3 mM sodium azide as previously described [ 19 2.6 Analysis of Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra Proton NMR analysis was performed at the Minnesota NMR center utilizing a Bruker Advance III 700‐MHz spectrometer equipped with a 1.7 mm cryogenic probe and a Sample Jet refrigerated sample changer. All 1020 samples were analyzed in NMR over nine batches of ~110 each from 2016 to 2020. Immediately before the acquisition, each sample was heated to 25°C. A 700 MHz Bruker Advance III NMR spectrometer with a 1.7 mm TCI cryoprobe was used to obtain NMR spectral profiles in PICF and negative control samples. A gradient‐enhanced two‐dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (2D 1H‐1H TOCSY) pulse sequence with “water suppression” by excitation sculpting (mlevesgpph) using 32 transients and 128 increments, and a 7000 Hz spectral width in each dimension was utilized. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined by matching 2D 1H‐1H TOCSY spectra profiles in public databases, Madison‐Qingdao Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD) and Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). These datasets contain 77 potential metabolite resonances identified in historical GCF/PISF and saliva samples [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 S3 2.7 Statistical Analysis Demographic data were analyzed using Chi‐square tests, ANOVA, and Student's t‐test. Metabolomic analyses used the web‐based MetaboAnalyst 4.0 and 5.0 software suite ( https://www.metaboanalyst.ca 38 A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach was utilized to test for the association between disease status (PPD, RBL) and the top principal components (PCs) responsible for the variance within each group. In metabolomics, PCA is utilized as a graphical representation to identify the distribution and variance pattern in a group (Figure S2A 29 Q 2 38 t p A pattern search using the “Pattern Hunter” feature in MetaboAnalyst was performed. This analysis helps in the identification of metabolites showing a particular pattern of change similar to one chosen metabolite. This pattern‐matching method demonstrates the metabolites most likely and least likely to match the concentrations of another metabolite. The resulting image shows both positively correlated and negatively correlated compounds displayed in a bar graph (Figure S3 The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value was utilized to determine if any of the 35 metabolites were of diagnostic value. We performed classical univariate receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) as well as their 95% confidence intervals, to compute optimal cutoffs for any given feature, as well as to generate performance tables for sensitivity, specificity, and confidence intervals at different cutoffs. Student's t α We manually selected a combination of metabolites to create a biomarker model that showed a higher AUC value than any single metabolite. Hierarchical clustering using the Euclidean distance measure and Ward algorithm was performed on the top 15 significant features ( p After cross‐sectional comparisons, similar AUC analyses were performed for longitudinal comparisons of each metabolite in PICF samples at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. For each time point, clinical data were used to identify sites demonstrating RBL loss. The metabolite profiles of disease‐progressing sites and non‐progressing sites were also compared longitudinally. These non‐progressing sites are either healthy or PI implants assessed at the time of enrollment or at the beginning of the 6‐month interval considered. ANOVApost hocanalysis using Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) and FDR were computed to compare metabolites in progressing, non‐progressing, and healthy sites. Cross‐validation for PLS‐DA data was performed in the cross‐sectional (diagnostic) component (Figure S3B S4C Indeterminate results or missing data from either the index test (metabolomic biomarker analysis) or the reference standard (clinical and radiographic measures) were handled by excluding these cases from the analysis (Figure S1 3 Results 3.1 Demographic Data: Frequency Distributions of Variables Seventy‐one subjects with 151 functioning implants were enrolled in the study. After exclusion due to PICF sampling errors, the remaining subject pool ( n p S1 Out of 68 subjects, seven subjects were excluded due to pus or bleeding on the sampling membrane or failed NMR data output. The remaining 61 subjects yielded a total of 128 implant samples. Sixty‐one HI and 31 PI implants were analyzed.

Sixty‐two metabolite‐coherent resonances were identified in the PICF of PI and HI, consistent with 35 metabolites (Table S3 PCA shows that the noise signals of the NMR assay in “buffer control” samples are tightly clustered while the variance among all PICF samples is wider (Figure S2A 2A 2B n n 27 33 41 42 2C FIGURE 2 Diseased PICF metabolomic profiles are different from healthy samples and Cadaverine.Lysine is the top metabolite showing separation between diseased and healthy.

The 10‐fold Cross‐Validation was used to generate a logistic regression model and calculate the performance of combining 4 metabolite resonances among the top 11 VIP scores identified with PLS‐DA.

Although 24 subjects were only sampled once at baseline, 13 subjects were sampled twice, six subjects were sampled three times, 14 subjects were sampled four times, and 14 subjects were sampled five times. Some subjects missed their scheduled sampling visits and were subsequently sampled at the follow‐up visits. A total of 15 implants were explanted during the trial while 13 implants had surgical treatment and were thus excluded from the analysis. Nine subjects had 13 implants that progressed > 1 mm of RBL loss throughout the study (Figure 1 S5 Clinically, the untreated implants were separated into (Group A) PI progressing implants (> 0.5 mm RBL change) and non‐progressing implants subdivided into (Group B) healthy non‐progressing implants and (Group C) PI non‐progressing implants (< 0.5 mm RBL change) measured at any following 6‐month timepoint within the 24 months. The cut‐off of 0.5 mm change within the 6‐month interval was chosen because it could be reliably assessed after normalization of the radiographic measurements. 5.1 PICF Metabolomic Profiles Differentiate Implants That Lose > 1 mm RBL From Healthy or Diseased but Stable Implants To dichotomize the comparison of the metabolomic profiles at the time point before and after the RBL change, implants in Group A (progressors; n n n 4A 4B FIGURE 4 PICF metabolite levels differ in RBL loss progressing, non‐progressing, and healthy implants.

In the cross‐sectional component of this study, we found that simple metabolites may discriminate peri‐implant health from disease. The top metabolites significantly correlated with PI were Cadaverine, Lysine, Putrescine, Alanine, and Valine. Decarboxylation of amino acids may yield alpha‐ and omega‐diamines such as Putrescine and Cadaverine [ 44 23 23 45 A fraction of diseased and HI were followed longitudinally every 6 months. When the PICF metabolites in 6 implants losing bone were compared to HI or to diseased implants that did not lose bone, it became apparent that a new set of metabolites emerged as predictors of radiographic bone loss. Biotin, Propionate, and Valine seem to predict RBL stability in PI over time, while Proline and 1‐3‐diaminopropane were higher around implants losing bone. Proline offered excellent accuracy in predicting disease progression, while 1‐3‐diaminopropane demonstrated a good accuracy. Proline's association with progressive peri‐implant disease was not surprising because it is an essential component of collagen and was recently found to be associated with severe periodontitis in a salivary metabolomics study [ 46 47 48 Those metabolites identified in the longitudinal component of the study were different from the metabolites that differentiated health from disease in the cross‐sectional comparison of healthy versus diseased implants. The significant metabolites differentiating PI implants from HI at baseline (cross‐sectional component) were not the same metabolites predicting future RBL loss in the longitudinal evaluation. This can be explained by two reasons. First, the diseased group at baseline included future progressors and non‐progressors as well as “other” implants that were not included in the cross‐sectional PI vs. HI comparison. This trial demonstrated that not all diseased implants are equal because some progress to more RBL loss while some are stable. Second, the HI group at baseline may have also included implants that were about to deteriorate in the near future, thus harboring metabolite levels that were different from HI that remained healthy. It appears that peri‐implantitis sites that are stable and not progressing have a different metabolic status than sites that resulted in RBL loss within the 6‐month interval. This is plausible because, like in periodontitis, the periodontal microbiota [ 49 50 51 52 7 Study Limitations and Strengths Metabolomics research in periodontology is limited. Proton‐NMR detects hydrogen resonances that are matched with known molecules, yet this study had overlapping hydrogen resonances belonging to two different metabolites. Choosing two resonances of the same metabolite overcame in part this limitation. Mass spectrometry paired with NMR should confirm the findings of this study. It is essential to acknowledge the limitations imposed by the single‐center design and sample size, particularly in the longitudinal component of this study. Specifically, while the cross‐sectional analysis included 128 implant samples from 71 subjects, the longitudinal component was limited to 47 subjects with a total of 112 implant samples in a subpopulation of individuals undergoing periodontal supportive therapy. This relatively small sample size, especially in the longitudinal analysis with 6‐month intervals (40 implant samples), constrains the generalizability of the prognostic findings. The number of implants in the longitudinal component is limited for three reasons. First, most of the implants recruited in the cross‐sectional component opted for treatment. Second, only the subjects who elected not to be treated were measured and re‐sampled at 6‐month intervals. Over the 24‐month study, any interval of 6 months was considered to detect > 1 mm RBL loss. The 6‐month intervals have the largest number of progressing implants. Third, the COVID‐19 pandemic limited the opportunity for re‐sampling subjects. Consequently, the results presented here should be interpreted cautiously as preliminary findings. This study represents an initial exploratory stage in biomarker discovery for PID, aimed at identifying potential biomarkers at the site level rather than in saliva that may warrant further investigation. Monitoring untreated diseased implants over time presents ethical considerations, primarily related to patient well‐being and informed consent. Allowing disease progression without intervention may expose patients to potential discomfort, further tissue damage, and increased risk of implant failure. To address these concerns, patients were fully informed about the risks associated with non‐treatment and provided with the option to receive care at any time. This approach ensured that participants could make autonomous, informed decisions, balancing the need for observational data with ethical obligations to prioritize patient health. Studying disease progression around implants may be unethical if this criterion was not part of the study design and approved by the IRB. Samples NMR batch effects were not computed, and weak statistical adjustments for multiple comparisons might be limitations in the longitudinal comparisons. Saliva can provide unique and valuable information about the oral and systemic health status of a subject. However, the site specificity of PICF sampling allows us to identify biomarkers more directly related to the local pathological condition. Unlike mass spectrometry, which requires chemical derivatization, proton‐NMR enables unbiased identification and quantification of biomarkers. Therefore, it is essential to adopt methodologies like proton‐NMR that reduce biases in identifying metabolites associated with health or disease. Finally, it is important to emphasize the importance of longitudinal studies offering a unique window into the dynamics of disease progression. 8 Conclusions PICF unbiased metabolomic profiling identified with proton NMR spectroscopy can be considered for novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. These metabolomic profiles were able to discriminate between PI and HI, as well as for early detection of disease progression. Lysine coherent resonances consistent with Cadaverine and Putrescin were significantly correlated with PI, while alpha‐Ketoglutarate and Methionine were correlated with implant health. Furthermore, profiles of biotin, propionate, and valine exhibited statistically significant differences when comparing the implants that had progressive bone loss over time with diseased but stable implants or HI. Although underpowered, this study also identified the molecular signatures of proline and 1‐3‐diaminopropane in PI progression, while arginine was associated with non‐progressing PI. Future studies may investigate the metabolic pathways of these metabolites associated with PI and its progression to better understand its pathogenesis and biological mechanisms. The study demonstrates that metabolomics is a promising future approach when exploring biomarkers for clinical use. Adopting a rigorous and methodological approach to sampling, analysis, and metabolite studies is crucial for pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and improving diagnosis and treatment strategies in the field of dentistry. This study's importance relates to the discovery of metabolites that show promise as diagnostic and prognostic indicators for peri‐implantitis. If independent studies validate our results, it should be possible to design simpler point‐of‐care chairside tests to diagnose and predict future peri‐implant disease onset and progression.
