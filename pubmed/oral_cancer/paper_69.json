Materials and Methods We performed this study among 883 inpatients with new‐onset type 2 diabetes, and the data were divided randomly into training and validation groups. The logistic regression method was used to identify the independent risk factors of MAFLD, and a nomogram was established according to the logistic regression analysis and these selected parameters. The discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the nomogram were measured by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration curves, and decision‐curve analysis, respectively. Results Eight variables were identified and included in the nomogram (body mass index, alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, urea nitrogen and serum uric acid). The value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.898 for the training group and 0.92 for the validation group. The calibration plots indicated that this model had good accuracy, and the decision‐curve analysis revealed high‐clinical practicability of the nomogram. Conclusions This study established a convenient and practical nomogram model, which can be used as an easy‐to‐use tool to evaluate the risk of MAFLD among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. It is critical to develop a simple, cost‐effective and practical predictive measurement for screening MAFLD individuals in the early stage of T2DM. We developed a nomogram model based on eight clinical and laboratory indicators to predict MAFLD in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. We demonstrated that this model had a good predictive ability and clinical application value for predicting MAFLD.

Although liver biopsy is considered as the gold standard in the assessment of steatotic liver disease, its limitations have been extensively discussed  19  20  21  22  23  24  25 The prediction models for NAFLD using readily available parameters have been gaining attention. Most common clinical variables for hepatic steatosis include anthropometric indicators such as body mass index (BMI), metabolic risk measures such as total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), glucose, and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) and liver enzymes such as alanine transferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  26  27  28  29  30 MATERIALS AND METHODS Research design and participants This study had a retrospective design, in which 1,063 individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM hospitalized in the Endocrine Department of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University Dezhou Hospital between 2016 and 2024 were selected. Then patients with acute complications of diabetes such as ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar coma, trauma, acute infectious diseases, or serious heart, liver or kidney injuries were excluded. A total of 883 patients were included in the final analysis. All the participants in the research signed written informed consent for this study. This study was conducted conforming to the ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the ethics committees of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University Dezhou Hospital. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was based on the WHO and American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria  31 The diagnostic criteria for MAFLD require hepatic steatosis with at least one of five cardiometabolic features including impaired glucose regulation, T2DM, overweight or obesity, hypertension, or dyslipidemia  32  33 Physical and laboratory examinations The physical indices of the study participants, namely systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), height, and weight, were measured during the routine procedures. Subsequently, their Body Mass Index (BMI) was computed by dividing weight by the square of height (kg/m 2 Liver ultrasound examination Each participant underwent a liver ultrasonography after fasting for over 8 h. All ultrasound examinations were performed by experienced radiologists and interpreted through a standardized double‐reading process involving two independent specialists. The ultrasonic diagnostic benchmarks for fatty liver were as follows: (1) Diffuse punctate hyperecho in the near field of the liver area, with a stronger signal than that of the spleen and kidney; (2) The far‐field echo progressively diminished and the light spots were sparse; (3) The intrahepatic duct structure was not distinctly visualized; (4) The liver was mildly to moderately enlarged, and its edges were rounded and blunt. The existence of item #1 in combination with at least one of items #2, #3, and #4 was regarded as fatty liver  33 Statistical analysis All data management and statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and R v. 4.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

MAFLD: metabolic dysfunction‐associated fatty liver disease. The model was formed by eight risk factors of MAFLD including body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TG), low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), high‐density lipoprotein (HDL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and serum uric acid (SUA). Validation of the nomogram The predictive ability of the model was verified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Figure 2 2 4 3 3 4 4 Figure 2 Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) of nomogram in training set (a) and validation set (b).

DISCUSSION In this cross‐sectional study, we developed a nomogram based on eight clinical and laboratory indicators including BMI, ALT, TG, LDL, HDL, FBG, BUN and SUA, and demonstrated that it had a good predictive ability and clinical application value for predicting MAFLD in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. This is the first time that the nomogram model has been applied to predict MAFLD in the early stage of type 2 diabetes and the simple nomogram has the potential to economize more medical resources and decrease the incidence of missed diagnosis. With increasing global incidence, metabolic dysfunction‐associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), previously named nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has become the most common liver disease worldwide. Previous models forecast that China will have the largest increase in NAFLD prevalence compared with the rest of the world in 2030  34  35  36  37  37  38  18  17 Previous studies have developed some screening models combining anthropometric parameters (BMI, waist circumference, neck circumference, etc.), demographics (age, sex, etc.), biochemical indicators (ALT, LDL‐C, TG, SUA, FPG, etc.) and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) to achieve early detection and evaluation of NAFLD  39  40  41  42  43  44  45 In our study, we identified eight independent predictive factors of MAFLD using classical regression analysis methods. These factors included anthropometric parameters (BMI) and biochemical indicators (ALT, LDL‐C, HDL‐C, TG, SUA, FPG and BUN) which are all easy to obtain. Overweight and obesity are widely recognized as the primary causes of MAFLD, and elevated BMI is one of the main risk factors for MAFLD  46  27  47  48  48  49  50  51 There are several limitations in this study. Firstly, the current study was conducted using data from a single center, which may limit the generalizability of our findings and potentially lead to overestimation of performance metrics. Future studies should use multicenter or prospective cohorts incorporating diverse populations to externally validate this model. Secondly, this study were cross‐sectional designs and so cannot fully address causality or temporality between predictors and MAFLD incidence. Third, the diagnosis of MAFLD in our study was based on ultrasound, which is relatively insensitive for detecting mild steatosis (when hepatic fat accumulation is less than 20%). This limitation may result in some patients with mild fatty liver being undiagnosed, thereby reducing the model's predictive sensibility for lower degrees of steatosis. Nonetheless, ultrasonography remains the first‐line screening modality for hepatic steatosis recommended by major clinical guidelines due to its feasibility, cost‐effectiveness, and safety  52 In conclusion, in this study, a practical and convenient nomogram was developed and validated to detect MAFLD in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. Eight parameters including BMI, ALT, TG, LDL, HDL, FBG, BUN, and SUA were included in the nomogram. This nomogram can be utilized as an easy‐to‐use and objective tool, which is conducive to screening early T2DM subjects with a high risk of MAFLD and promotes better clinical diagnosis and prevention.
