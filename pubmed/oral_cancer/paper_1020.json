These compounds act either directly or through their metabolites and can influence various biochemical pathways. Key phthalates that have been associated with potential toxic outcomes include di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DiNP), and diisodecyl phthalate (DiDP). The presence of these compounds in everyday consumer products has been associated with various adverse effects on human reproductive health, including hormonal disruption, issues in gonadal function, and other hormone related problems. This systematic review provides an overview and critical synthesis of the most recent research regarding phthalate reproductive toxicity. The scope is to summarize and aggregate correlations between phthalate exposure and reproductive health outcomes and highlight factors, such as age, sex, and extent of exposure, that have the most significant impacts on clinical outcomes. The reported studies focus on the gender-specific outcomes of various phthalates, while the epidemiological data reveal the importance of exposure duration and age. The reported results highlight the need for strict regulations regarding phthalate usage and the importance of developing safer alternatives. reproductive health phthalates reproductive toxicology phthalate toxicity di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) dibutyl phthalate (DBP) phthalate exposure European Union 101137405 This research was funded by NEMESIS (Novel effect biomarkers for metabolic disruptors: evidence on health impacts to answer science and policy needs) project.

Introduction Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances that bind to protein targets inside the cells and induce adverse health effects in the human organism [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Phthalates are inexpensive to produce, readily incorporated into polymers, and can improve product performance [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 The compounds can be categorized into two primary groups according to their molecular weight: high molecular weight (HMW) phthalates, utilized to enhance the elasticity of polyvinyl chloride, and low molecular weight (LMW) phthalates, applied as adhesives or solvents in the production of cosmetic products [ 22 23 24 25 25 26 25 Exposure to phthalates begins in utero and continues throughout a person’s lifetime via dietary sources, dermal absorption, and inhalation [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 14 Phthalate exposure has been frequently associated with reproductive health issues in both males and females [ 33 34 35 36 37 37 38 Given the serious reproductive health risks associated with phthalates, regulatory agencies have initiated actions to address these rising safety concerns. In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has banned the use of phthalates in toys and childcare items since 2018 [ 39 16 40 Despite considerable efforts to mitigate the risks associated with phthalate exposure, understanding their long-term effects and evaluating the overall effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains challenging. Prior literature reviews have established a solid understanding of the reproductive toxicities associated with phthalates. For example, one review examined in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological data to demonstrate how phthalates (i) disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis, (ii) interfere with steroid production, and (iii) alter receptor-mediated cellular pathways [ 37 33 The present systematic review addresses these gaps by integrating evidence gathered from January 2020 to June 2024 through a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses)-guided, methodologically robust evaluation, thereby providing a more comprehensive analysis of phthalates’ reproductive toxicity while ensuring transparency and reproducibility. We provide a summary of the available evidence on phthalate exposure, metabolism, and reproductive toxicity from in vivo, in vitro, and epidemiological studies with a particular emphasis on the reproductive toxicities associated with phthalates (e.g., impacts on fertility, hormonal disruption, and overall reproductive health). By systematically reviewing the recently published literature, this work aims to update existing knowledge on phthalate-related reproductive toxicity drawing on reported toxicity profiles of individual compounds. The scope is to address key questions such as the following: “ What reproductive toxicity outcomes are linked to phthalate exposure? Which phthalates present the strongest evidence of inducing adverse reproductive impacts? 2. Methodology 2.1. Eligibility Criteria This review includes studies published in English between January 2020 and June 2024 that investigate the reproductive toxicity of phthalates, either as single compounds or in mixtures ( Table S1 https://osf.io/ Table 1 Table 2 Both human and animal studies were included, with focus on in vivo models relevant to human reproductive health, including rats and mice. In vitro studies using human cell lines and samples were also included to assess the cell specificity of the toxicity impact and thus improve the accuracy of extrapolating human health effects. The inclusion criteria required that studies report direct parental reproductive toxicity, involving at least one of the following outcomes: fertility parameters (e.g., sperm quality, follicular count), reproductive health (e.g., hormonal levels, testicular or ovarian function), or reproductive toxicity. Both experimental and observational study designs (e.g., cohort, case–control, cross-sectional) qualified for inclusion. The following exclusion criteria were applied: Language Studies with non-conserved reproductive mechanisms o In vitro studies using animal cell lines. o In vivo studies employing animal models where experimental endpoints lack translational validity for human reproductive health (e.g., zebrafish ( Danio rerio C. elegans Co-exposure Irrelevant outcomes: Non-original research: 2.2. Search Strategy The aim of this systematic review was to gain insights into the reproductive toxicities of phthalates. PubMed and Scopus were selected as the primary databases. Gray literature (e.g., theses, conference proceedings) was excluded to focus exclusively on fully peer-reviewed studies. The search terms that were used to search abstracts, titles, and keywords of papers were the following: (“phthalates” OR “phthalate esters” OR “DEHP” OR “DBP” OR “BBP” OR “DiNP” OR “DiDP”) AND (“fertility” OR “reproductive health” OR “infertility” OR “reproductive toxicity” OR “sperm count” OR “ovarian function” OR “hormonal disruption” OR “pregnancy outcomes”). This combination of search terms was used to retrieve a wide range of relevant studies that could be evaluated based on the specified inclusion criteria. While the term “pregnancy outcomes” was included in the search strategy to ensure comprehensive retrieval of potentially relevant studies, such research whose sole endpoints were pregnancy outcomes or fetal development was later excluded during screening based on predefined exclusion criteria (see Section 2.1 2.3. Study Selection Process The study selection process was systematically conducted. Zotero—Corporation for Digital Scholarship: Vienna, VA, https://www.zotero.org/ During the final screening process, we excluded eight studies due to the lack of access to the full-text articles. Eventually, 90 studies were included in our review for data extraction. The full selection process was documented using a PRISMA flow diagram ( Figure S1 Table S2 41 3. Results 3.1. Overview of Selected Studies A total of 1126 records were retrieved from PubMed (477) and Scopus (649). A total of 90 publications met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this systematic review as outlined in Section 2.2 All considered in vivo studies examined the effects of phthalates on reproductive health in rodent models. These studies focused mostly on endpoints such as sperm quality, ovarian function, and hormonal disruptions. Human cell lines, including human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN), granulosa cells (GCs), and human prostatic cell line (PNT1A), were used in the in vitro analyses to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind phthalate-induced reproductive toxicity. Moreover, human epidemiological studies provided overall insights into the impact of phthalate exposure, with a focus on reproductive outcomes such as infertility, hormonal imbalances, and semen quality parameters. 3.2. In Vivo Studies The results of the in vivo studies and the toxicity outcomes related to phthalate exposure in the animal models are collected in Table 3 Table S3 42 43 44 In female mice, exposure to DEHP resulted in a significant decrease in ovarian weight, a reduction in serum levels of 17β-estradiol (E2), and an elevation of apoptotic markers (Caspase-9, BAX/BCL2) within ovarian cells [ 45 46 47 47 On the other hand, DEHP exposure in male mice led to a reduction in testicular weight, a significant drop in sperm count, and decreased serum testosterone levels. Additionally, DEHP exposure led to the downregulation of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, connexin-43 (CX-43), N-cadherin) in Sertoli cells, which compromised the blood–testis barrier (BTB) [ 48 49 50 51 Phthalate mixture (DEHP, DBP, BBP) exposure in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats further demonstrated significant reproductive toxicity, with varying outcomes based on dose and duration of exposure. In the high-dose regiment (450 mg/kg/day for 91 days), the exposure resulted in upregulation of steroidogenic enzymes such as CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), as well as decreased expression of Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein (StAR), suggesting a significant disruption in steroid hormones production [ 52 53 ijms-26-08761-t003_Table 3 Table 3 Overview of the main toxicological effects of phthalates on reproductive health with different doses, exposure routes, and in vivo models among studies included. Detailed information on all studies is presented in Table S3 Animal Model Phthalate(s) Used Exposure (Dose, ROA, Duration) Main Effects Reference Four-week-old female ICR mice DEHP 0, 500, 1000, 1500 mg/kg/day by gavage for 30 days  - ↑ autophagy, - Apoptosis, - Inflammation in ovarian granulosa cells and follicular atresia, - Dose-dependent effects observed.

[ 56 Thirty-three-day-old female CD-1 mice DEHP, DiNP 0.15, 1.5, 1500 ppm for each, orally for 1 month and 6 months  - Short-term exposure decreased FSH levels. - Long-term exposure: (i) primordial follicles ↑, (ii) FSH levels ↑, (iii) preantral and antral follicles ↓, (iv) LH levels ↓. - Both exposures upregulated pituitary genes (Nr5a1, Cga), - No significant changes observed in LH, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol, ovarian follicle populations (short-term), or ovarian steroidogenic gene expression.

[ 52 Newborn male ICR mice DEHP 30, 500 mg/kg/day orally from birth to postnatal day 21  - Testicular damage (thinning, incomplete tissue, reduced spermatogenic cells), - ↑ apoptosis, - ↓ sperm count and motility, - ↓ serum hormones (GnRH, FSH, LH, T, E2), - Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

[ 47 Twenty-eight-day-old male Fischer CDF344 rats MEHP 700 mg/kg single dose by gavage once Increased MHC-II+ peritubular macrophages (CD68+) and PLZF+ spermatogonia, indicating immune activation and potential spermatogenesis disruption. [ 56 3.3. In Vitro Studies To further understand the cellular basis of phthalate toxicity, we focused on studies that employed human cell lines and samples ( Table 4 Exposure to MEHP, the main metabolite of DEHP, was shown to have significant impacts on various cellular functions. In the KGN cell line, exposure to MEHP led to a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability, with notable effects occurring at concentrations of 200 µM or more (after an exposure of 24 h). The exposure also led to induced apoptosis through the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cleaved-Caspase-3) alongside the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, it increased the phosphorylation of IκBα, which activated the NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β). MEHP also increased levels of autophagic markers (Beclin-1, Atg5, p62, LC3-II) and triggered oxidative stress (increased ROS, decreased GSH and SOD), indicating its multifaceted disruption of granulosa cell function [ 45 54 57 Beyond the ovarian cell toxicity, DBP exposure in the PNT1A cell line (derived from human prostate tissue) increased oxidative stress, altered redox homeostasis, and disrupted reproductive hormone signaling by interfering with both estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and androgen receptor (AR) activity [ 58 58 59 59 DEHP and DnOP were found to accumulate significantly in human sperm cells, in comparison to other phthalates. The results of PAE concentration in sperm were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The observed accumulation is potentially associated with their high lipophilic index (logP) [ 60 60 61 ijms-26-08761-t004_Table 4 Table 4 Overview of the main toxicological effects of phthalates on reproductive health, as demonstrated by the in vitro studies included.

[ 61 Following the analysis of data gathered from both in vivo and in vitro studies, the main reproductive toxicities identified by the research are illustrated in the schematic representation below ( Figure 1 3.4. Epidemiological Studies Besides in vitro and animal study, our search strategy included various epidemiological studies that covered a wide variety of population ages and geographical regions ( Table 5 Table S4 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 Exposure to phthalates can vary significantly across different occupations and lifestyles, with certain professions and habitual product use posing higher risks. For example, individuals working in farming, dentistry, and artisanal work had a higher risk of infertility, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.766 (95% CI 1.236–6.185), which was linked to DnBP and DEHP exposure [ 70 69 70 Phthalates have been repeatedly associated with disruptions in hormone regulation, with various studies underlining their effects on reproductive hormones in both sexes. One such study indicated that MEP and MEOHP significantly decreased cortisol (COR) and corticosterone (CORT) levels in women with diminished ovarian reserve, resulting in a lower number of retrieved oocytes [ 71 64 72 Numerous studies on human cohorts focused on phthalate exposure in adults (n = 26), while others examined exposure during childhood and adolescence (n = 4). The respective findings demonstrate how phthalates can influence reproductive health in different ages. For instance, high exposure to anti-androgenic phthalates (AAPs), such as DEHP, DiNP, MBzP, MnBP, and MiBP, has been associated with delayed puberty in boys, with delays of 8 to 14 months in pubarche and 5.4 to 8.3 months in testicular development [ 73 74 75 ∑ P A E 76 Longitudinal studies can also provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of early-life exposure to phthalates and how they can affect reproductive health. Higher urinary MiBP levels during early puberty correlated with a trend toward declining semen quality. Additionally, higher urinary concentrations of the molar sum of DiNP metabolites ( ∑ D i N P 77 4. Discussion 4.1. Synthesis of the Key Reproductive Toxicities of Phthalates The combined findings extracted from the in vivo, in vitro, and epidemiological studies highlight the varied reproductive toxic effects of phthalates in both male and female individuals. These effects can occur through various pathways such as the following: (i) hormonal disruption, (ii) oxidative stress, (iii) induction of apoptotic and inflammatory pathways, and (iv) structural damage to reproductive organs. Research conducted with animal models ( Table 3 Table S3 In vitro studies strengthen these conclusions ( Table 4 Table 4 Table 3 Moreover, epidemiological evidence supports the real-world implications of these observations ( Table 5 Table S4 4.2. Strengths and Limitations of the Systematic Review This systematic review offers a thorough synthesis of the existing evidence (January 2020–June 2024) concerning the reproductive toxicities of phthalates, combining findings from in vivo, in vitro, and epidemiological studies. The inclusion of various study designs, ranging from mechanistic explorations in human cell lines to population-based cohort research, strengthens the overall conclusions. Following PRISMA guidelines enhances methodological clarity while the introduction of predetermined eligibility criteria allows the researchers to focus on specific aspects in their analysis while avoiding dual entries or incorporating gray literature. Furthermore, by addressing both male and female reproductive outcomes, the review provides a well-rounded view of phthalate-induced reproductive toxicity, emphasizing dose-dependent effects and various mechanisms through which phthalates disrupt hormonal balance, cellular function, and reproductive outcomes. Nonetheless, there are limitations regarding the scope of this review since the exclusion of studies involving co-exposure to other chemical groups limits the understanding of the way phthalates interact with other environmental pollutants and how they impact human reproductive health. Furthermore, the varying methodologies, endpoints, and levels of phthalate exposure in the studies make it challenging to formulate direct comparisons. For instance, in vivo studies utilized a wide range of doses, different exposure durations, and various rodent strains, which may affect the toxicity results. Additionally, in vitro studies offered valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of phthalate toxicities, yet their small number (n = 11), combined with the use of concentrations that exceed normal environmental exposure levels, raises concerns about the diversity of mechanistic findings and their physiological relevance. While epidemiological studies offer valuable real-world insights, many do not adequately address confounding factors (such as co-exposure to other chemicals and lifestyle variables), which may alter or distort the associations reported. The prevalence of cross-sectional designs in human studies also constrains causal conclusions, and longitudinal data on early-life phthalate exposure and long-term reproductive outcomes remains limited. Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, phthalates typically have short half-lives (usually less than 24 h in both humans and rodents) [ 78 4.3. Research Gaps and Future Directions Despite notable advances in understanding the reproductive toxicities associated with phthalates, significant gaps in research remain. Firstly, although DiNP and DiDP are prohibited in toys, they are still commonly utilized as substitutes for DEHP in the manufacturing of PVC products despite insufficient toxicological assessment [ 16 Moreover, most studies evaluate exposure in the general population and more focused research into particularly exposed or vulnerable populations, such as children, adolescents, and occupationally exposed groups (e.g., workers in PVC manufacturing or agriculture), which promises to provide important insights into phthalate effects in at-risk groups. Exposure to phthalates has been associated with alterations in puberty onset in both males and females, yet the specific molecular mechanisms driving these sex-dependent effects remain unclear [ 73 74 Critically, research designs often utilize high-dose, short-duration exposures that do not accurately represent real-life exposure circumstances (chronic, low-dose). For example, studies examining the impact of DEHP on sperm quality and ovarian reserves usually employed doses much higher than what individuals are normally exposed to, which might not provide an accurate assessment of its effects. Similarly, mechanistic investigations should consider the use of emerging organotypic and microphysiological human culture models instead of cell lines to increase translational relevance and align with societal and regulatory objectives [ 79 Ultimately, enhancing structure–activity relationship (SAR) research and utilizing computational tools could transform phthalate risk management. The current knowledge regarding the mechanism with which specific chemical structures influence toxicity (e.g., the length of ester chains or degree of aromaticity) requires more attention. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, developed using extensive toxicological data, could forecast interactions between phthalates and receptors (like estrogen or androgen receptors) to identify potential dangers. For example, ML-driven virtual screening could reveal plasticizers that retain their functional properties while minimizing endocrine disruption. Furthermore, recent work has shown that ML models, such as logistic regression, artificial neural networks, XGBoost, and Bayesian networks, can predict disease risks based on a combination of demographic data, laboratory data (including plasticizer metabolite levels in human urine), and lifestyle habits [ 80 80 81 5. Conclusions The review compiles evidence from 90 studies to underscore the significant reproductive toxicity of phthalates in both males and females. Research conducted both in vivo and in vitro indicates that phthalates impair spermatogenesis, lower ovarian reserve, and disrupt hormonal balance via oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory mechanisms. Epidemiological research further links phthalate exposure to infertility, altered hormone levels, and developmental delays during puberty. Regulatory actions have limited the use of high-risk phthalates like DEHP, while compounds such as DiNP and DiDP are being increasingly utilized in PVC production due to their assumed lower toxicity. However, there is emerging evidence suggesting that these compounds also pose reproductive risks, necessitating urgent toxicological assessment. The key limitations in toxicological assessment include inconsistent exposure assessments and insufficient data on early life exposures or long-term effects. Future research needs to prioritize vulnerable populations, realistic exposure scenarios, and computational approaches to evaluate the toxicity of phthalates and develop safer alternatives. Addressing these gaps will enhance regulatory frameworks and reduce the worldwide impact of phthalate-induced reproductive toxicity.
