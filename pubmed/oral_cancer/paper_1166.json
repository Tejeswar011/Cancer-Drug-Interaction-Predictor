Its complex pathological mechanisms, such as blood–brain barrier damage, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, along with the restrictive nature of the blood–brain barrier, have restricted the clinical therapeutic effects of drugs. Nanotechnology, with its advantages of targeting ability, biocompatibility, and multifunctionality, has provided a new approach for the precise diagnosis and treatment of hemorrhagic stroke. In terms of diagnosis, imaging technology enhanced by magnetic nanoparticles can achieve real-time bedside monitoring of hematoma dynamics and cerebral perfusion, significantly improving the timeliness compared with traditional imaging methods. In the field of treatment, the nanodrug delivery system can remarkably improve the bioavailability and brain targeting of clinical drugs and herbal medicines by enhancing drug solubility, crossing the blood–brain barrier, and responsive and targeting drug release. Multifunctional inorganic nanomaterials, such as cerium oxide nanoparticles, graphene, and perfluorooctyl octyl ether nanoparticles, can alleviate brain edema and neuronal damage through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and the scavenging of free radicals. Moreover, gene delivery mediated by nanocarriers and stem cell transplantation protection strategies have provided innovative solutions for regulating molecular pathways and promoting nerve repair. Although nanotechnology has shown great potential in the diagnosis and treatment of hemorrhagic stroke, its clinical translation still faces challenges such as the evaluation of biosafety, standardization of formulations, and verification of long-term efficacy. In the future, it is necessary to further optimize material design and combine multimodal treatment strategies to promote a substantial breakthrough in this field from basic research to clinical application. nanotechnology nanomaterials hemorrhagic stroke diagnosis treatment Gansu Province Science and Technology Program Project 25JRRA628 25JRRA615 Cuiying Science and Technology Innovation Project of the of Lanzhou University Second Hospital CY2022-QN-A01 This research was funded by the Gansu Province Science and Technology Program Project [25JRRA628; 25JRRA615]; and the Cuiying Science and Technology Innovation Project of the of Lanzhou University Second Hospital (CY2022-QN-A01). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction With the increase in aging and people’s current sub-healthy lifestyle, stroke, as the main clinical type of cerebrovascular diseases, has become the second leading cause of human death. Together with heart disease and malignant tumors, it constitutes the three major diseases that cause death and disability in humans [ 1 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 Figure 1 9 10 11 12 These symptoms not only reduce the quality of life of stroke patients, causing functional disabilities, and increase the long-term mortality rate, but also increase the economic burden on society and the patients’ families [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 Nanotechnology represents a cutting-edge technology applied in the medical field, leveraging nanoscale materials and devices to exert significant impacts across various diseases including cancer and stroke [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Figure 2 2. Role of Nanotechnology in Investigating Pathological Mechanisms and Precision Diagnosis of Hemorrhagic Stroke The BBB, a dynamic neuroprotective interface within the neurovascular unit, comprises brain microvascular endothelial cells interconnected by tight junction proteins, basement membranes, pericytes, astrocytic end-feet, and oligodendrocytes. While endothelial tight junctions form the primary physical barrier [ 26 27 However, while the BBB’s barrier properties prevent pathogen invasion, they also severely restrict the delivery of therapeutic drugs into the brain. Notably, cerebral hemorrhage induces dynamic changes in BBB integrity, creating a potential temporal window for targeted drug delivery. Thus, understanding the mechanisms and temporal framework of BBB alterations after cerebral hemorrhage is critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Using a collagenase-induced striatal ICH model in mice, Al-Ahmady’s team [ 28 111 29 30 ® In clinical practice, the diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke necessitates the integration of clinical symptom assessment, neuroimaging examinations, and laboratory tests, with neuroimaging serving as a pivotal step in establishing a definitive diagnosis. Commonly used neuroimaging modalities include cranial CT and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enable rapid detection of the presence and location of hemorrhagic stroke, as well as quantification of hemorrhage volume. In certain cases, clinicians may perform cerebral angiography to evaluate the site and severity of vascular rupture. Research indicates that more than two-thirds of patients experience early neurological deterioration within 48 h due to hematoma expansion; thus, frequent neurological examinations facilitate early identification of signs of clinical deterioration and increased intracranial pressure [ 31 32 33 34 3. Nanotechnology Facilitating Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment Nanomaterials have emerged as a transformative force in addressing the multifaceted challenges of hemorrhagic stroke treatment, offering precise and versatile solutions to mitigate injury and promote recovery. During the critical acute phase requiring rapid intervention, nanocarriers constructed from biocompatible materials—such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and various inorganic nanoparticles—can penetrate the compromised BBB through tailored surface modifications like targeting peptides or antibodies. This enables site-specific delivery of therapeutic agents or functional nanoparticles, subsequently improving prognosis by intervening in multiple pathways including neuroinflammation and oxidative stress ( Figure 3 3.1. Application of Nanodelivery Systems in the Treatment of Hemorrhagic Stroke Complications After hemorrhagic stroke, a large amount of blood enters brain tissue, causing cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. This leads to mechanical compression and destruction of local tissues, reduces cortical cerebral blood flow, and causes direct damage and necrosis of surrounding neurons and glial cells. Vasospasm following SAH causes cerebrovascular constriction, resulting in insufficient cerebral blood supply and ischemic brain injury or even ischemic stroke [ 35 36 37 38 39 38 40 41 42 43 The BBB is one of the primary obstacles limiting the bioavailability of nimodipine and its delivery to brain tissue. To address this, researchers have developed a novel lactoferrin-modified long-circulating nanostructured lipid carrier (Lf-NLC), which features small particle size, uniform distribution, and high drug loading capacity. Studies indicate that Lf-NLC can not only effectively deliver nimodipine to brain tissue through receptor-mediated endocytosis but also exhibits significant neuroprotective effects by reducing cell apoptosis [ 44 45 Similarly, Mohsen et al. [ 46 47 48 ® Additionally, studies indicate that ropivacaine nanoparticles hold potential application value in treating vasospasm following SAH. Bai et al. [ 49 50 51 52 3.2. Multiple Applications and Breakthroughs of the Nanometer Drug Delivery System in the Treatment of Hemorrhagic Stroke Nanomaterials have demonstrated broad application prospects in drug loading and regulating the local microenvironment for the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke. Graphene, as a novel carbon nanomaterial, can serve as a drug carrier with high loading capacity due to its unique physicochemical properties. Research indicates that functionalized graphene oxide nanosheets (FGO) have been demonstrated to be biocompatible coatings which can significantly enhance drug loading efficiency and stability while exhibiting no cytotoxicity. Based on this, researchers [ 53 54 55 56 Phytogenic drugs (such as curcumin, astaxanthin, quercetin, ginsenoside Rb1, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate) have garnered significant attention due to their robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, their clinical applications are constrained by low bioavailability resulting from poor stability, solubility, and BBB permeability. Nanodrug delivery systems offer effective strategies to address these challenges. For instance, researchers synthesized ginsenoside Rb1 carbon quantum dots (RBCQDs) with a size range of 6–8 nm. Compared to free ginsenoside Rb1, intrathecal injection of Cy5-labeled RBCQDs significantly enhanced drug accumulation in brain tissue. Through mechanisms such as reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting ferroptosis, and neuronal apoptosis, RBCQDs decreased brain edema and brain tissue water content, restored blood perfusion in the dura mater region, and improved motor neurological function in mice [ 57 58 59 3 4 60 61 62 Curcumin, a natural compound extracted from turmeric rhizomes, demonstrates significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. To enhance its bioavailability, researchers have developed various curcumin nanodelivery systems, including curcumin nanoemulsion [ 63 64 65 66 67 63 64 65 66 67 67 3.3. The Intervention Efficacy of Inorganic Nanoparticles and Nanozymes in Hemorrhagic Stroke In the field of biomedical research, inorganic nanoparticles, nanozymes, and cerium nanoparticles (CeNPs) have demonstrated remarkable application potential in eliminating inflammation and oxidative stress. For example, there exists a dynamic equilibrium between the +3 and +4 valence states of cerium ions on the surface of cerium dioxide. This characteristic enables it to mimic the functions of superoxide dismutase and catalase. In an oxidative stress environment, CeNPs can effectively scavenge superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide through the Ce 3+ 4+ 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 3.4. Nanotechnology-Based Targeted Therapy for Molecular Pathway Gene Expression Post-ICH In the treatment of ICH, gene therapies targeting molecular pathways (e.g., siRNA and antibodies) show promise, yet their clinical translation is hindered by challenges such as poor circulatory stability, low bioavailability, and off-target effects. In recent years, nanotechnology has provided novel strategies to address these limitations. Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs), a class of artificial nucleic acid-based nanostructures, have emerged as a major research focus due to their three-dimensional polyhedral structure and broad biological functionalities. Chen et al. [ 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 3.5. Nanotechnology-Driven Development of Transplantation Stem Cell Therapy Stem cell transplantation therapy promotes neural repair by leveraging the self-renewal and differentiation capabilities of stem cells, with clinical studies confirming its ability to significantly improve patients’ neurological function and quality of life. However, the complex microenvironment at hemorrhagic sites (e.g., iron overload, hypoxia, and inflammatory responses) severely compromises the survival and functionality of transplanted stem cells, posing a critical bottleneck for therapeutic efficacy [ 84 85 86 87 3.6. The Current Limitations of Nanomaterials Although nanomaterials show great promise in treating hemorrhagic stroke, their application still faces several significant limitations. At the manufacturing level, the complex production processes and high costs of nanomaterials pose major barriers to large-scale adoption. Current synthesis methods heavily rely on advanced equipment and technology, rendering production both intricate and expensive. This complexity severely hampers the scalability and widespread clinical use of nanomedicines. It also challenges the reproducibility of traditional batch synthesis methods on an industrial scale, limiting their feasibility for broad clinical application [ 88 89 90 91 92 4. Conclusions and Perspectives 4.1. Conclusions Hemorrhagic stroke, a life-threatening neurological disorder, imposes a heavy societal and familial burden due to its high rates of disability and mortality. Conventional therapies are limited by the BBB and inefficient drug delivery, hindering effective intervention in its complex pathological progression. This review systematically integrates research advances in nanotechnology for hemorrhagic stroke diagnosis and treatment, and for the first time constructs a complete “diagnosis–delivery–treatment” framework, clearly demonstrating the innovative progress and application potential of this field ( Table 1 2 4.2. Future Perspectives Despite the immense potential of nanotechnology in hemorrhagic stroke management, its clinical translation still faces substantial challenges, including comprehensive biosafety evaluation, formulation standardization for batch-to-batch consistency, and rigorous validation of long-term therapeutic efficacy in large animal models. Future research efforts should focus on three key directions: first, optimizing nanomaterial design to enhance biocompatibility and reduce off-target effects, such as developing biodegradable polymers or cell membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles; second, advancing intelligent stimulus-responsive delivery systems that can precisely respond to hemorrhagic stroke-specific microenvironmental cues for spatiotemporally controlled drug release; third, integrating multimodal therapeutic strategies to synergistically intervene in the complex pathological cascade of hemorrhagic stroke. Moreover, cross-disciplinary collaboration holds great promise.

Nanomaterial Disease Main Research Conclusions References Indium and Dil double-labeled lipid nanoparticles ICH After intravenous injection, brain liposomes show a biphasic accumulation peak, with the most accumulation in the hematoma area and co-localization with activated microglia. Mechanistic studies find that in the early ICH stage, Caveolin-1-mediated transcytosis is enhanced, and in the later stage, Claudin-5 is significantly downregulated, revealing a dual-regulatory BBB permeability. [ 28 VCAM-SOD-lipid nanoparticles ICH The brain uptake of VCAM-SOD-lipid nanoparticles is significantly higher than that of SOD-lipid nanoparticles. And, the delivery efficiency of the targeted liposomes remains stable after the acute phase, while the delivery efficiency of the passive leakage pathway decays rapidly. [ 29 Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle-Synomag-D ICH Intravenous injection of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle-Synomag-D enables bedside detection within 3 min using MPI technology. MPI can clearly distinguish liquid and coagulated hematoma areas, monitor cerebral perfusion status synchronously, providing a key basis for choosing surgical timing. Moreover, it can sensitively identify complications like increased intracranial pressure and vasospasm. [ 33 Qdot ® SAH After injecting Qdot ® [ 30 Nimodipine–lipid nanoparticles; Nimodipine nano-suspension; Nimodipine–PLGA nanofibers; Nimodipine nanoemulsion; PPPMM; Nimodipine–A2B type miktoarm polymers; lactoferrin modified long circulation nanostructured lipid carriers; 99mTc-Nimodipine-LPM; Nimodipine–lipid nanocapsules; Nimodipine-Pluronic ® SAH These nano-formulations have improved the solubility, bioavailability, degree of vascular irritation, and concentration in the brain of nimodipine. [ 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 Ropivacaine–lipid nanoparticles; PLGA–ropivacaine nanoparticles SAH Ropivacaine nanoparticles significantly reduced the blood flow velocity of the basilar artery, the levels of nerve injury markers and endothelin-1. Meanwhile, they increased the diameter of the blood vessel and the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, decreased the apoptosis of endothelial cells, and alleviated vasospasm. [ 49 50 HSP20 and MK2 inhibitory peptide–PPAA nanoparticles; HSP20 siRNA and HSP27 recombinant protein–PPAA nanoparticles SAH Nanoparticles of PPAA loaded with HSP20 and MK2 inhibitory peptides, as well as PPAA nanoparticles of HSP20 siRNA and HSP27 recombinant protein, promote the cytoplasmic delivery of HSP20, MK2 inhibitory peptides, HSP20 siRNA, and HSP27 recombinant protein through a pH-dependent endosomal escape mechanism, significantly enhancing the vasodilatory ability. [ 51 52 Pirfenidone–functionalized nanoscale graphene oxide nanoparticles SAH The efficient release of pirfenidone–FGO significantly alleviated the neuroinflammation after SAH. In addition, pirfenidone–FGO also exhibited excellent near-infrared absorption properties and could be used for photoacoustic imaging to achieve rapid and real-time monitoring of brain tissue after SAH. [ 53 Rosuvastatin-PEG-PCL nanomicelles ICH The rosuvastatin-loaded nanomicelles significantly promoted the polarization of microglia/macrophages towards the M2 phenotype, inhibited the infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10, thereby reducing neuronal degeneration, alleviating cerebral edema, and improving neurological deficits. [ 54 Rsv@HFn ICH This nano-platform enhances the ability of the drug to cross the BBB, increases its accumulation at the injury site, and improves its therapeutic effect. Rsv@HFn also promotes the translocation of Nrf-2 to the cell nucleus, increases the expression of HO-1 and CD91, facilitates the shift of M1 microglia to the M2 phenotype, and reduces neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. In addition, Rsv@HFn improves the integrity of the BBB in ICH mice, reduces cerebral edema, and alleviates neuropathological damage. [ 55 PSL-FTY720/AB ICH Compared with the ICH group, the FTY720 group, and the PSL-FTY720 group, the PSL-FTY720/AB treatment group showed the best therapeutic effects in reducing cerebral edema in the ipsilateral basal ganglia and cerebral cortex, protecting the integrity of the BBB, inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, alleviating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and improving neurological deficits. [ 56 RBCQDs ICH Compared with free ginsenoside Rb1, Cy5-labeled RBCQDs significantly increased the drug accumulation in brain tissue. Through mechanisms such as alleviating oxidative stress and inhibiting ferroptosis and neuronal apoptosis, it reduced cerebral edema and the water content in brain tissue, restored blood perfusion in the dura mater area, and improved the motor nerve function of mice. [ 57 PEGylated-PLGA EGCG nanoparticles ICH PEGylated-PLGA EGCG nanoparticles have remarkable sustained-release characteristics. [ 58 Quercetin-loaded nanoemulsion ICH Quercetin-loaded nanoemulsion significantly reduced the hematoma volume in rats with ICH, maintained the activity of glutathione S-transferase, and increased the content of glutathione and the total antioxidant capacity. [ 59 Transferrin conjugated to PEG-encapsulated ATX nanoparticles ICH ATX nanoparticles can be effectively internalized into the cytoplasm of primary neurons within 6 h, and upregulate the expression of Bcl-2 12 h after exposure to oxyhemoglobin, while downregulating the expressions of Bax and caspase-3. [ 60 Catechin-based polyphenol nanoparticles surface-modified by thiol-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) ICH CNPs@PEG effectively maintained BBB integrity, reduced brain edema, significantly increased the survival rate of mice with cerebral hemorrhage and markedly improved neurological deficits after ICH. Mechanistically, CNPs@PEG accomplishes this by chelating iron, enhancing tissue antioxidant capacity, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting iron deposition. [ 61 AUTNPs SAH AUTNPs respond to the phase transition of perfluorooctyl bromide induced by ultrasound, break through the shell, in situ destroy the nanostructure, and release the drug to neurons in a targeted manner, exerting antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. [ 62 Curcumin nanoemulsion; curcumin polymer-based nanoparticles; curcumin–PEG-PCL nanoparticles ICH AND ICH Compared with free curcumin, curcumin nanoparticles significantly increased the drug concentration in the brains of mice. They also showed stronger neuroprotective effects in aspects such as inhibiting iron deposition in the brain tissue around the hematoma, reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species, alleviating the damage of the BBB, reducing the degree of cerebral edema, and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis. [ 63 64 65 66 67 Cerium dioxide nanoparticles ICH AND ICH Cerium nanoparticles can reduce the level of oxidative stress induced by heme, decrease the content of nitrite formed by nitric oxide, alleviate cytotoxicity, and mitigate the inflammatory response. In vivo studies have found that after intravenous administration, CeNPs mainly accumulate in the hemorrhagic hemisphere. They can not only effectively reduce cerebral edema, but also inhibit the recruitment of microglia/macrophages around the bleeding focus and the expression of inflammatory proteins. [ 69 70 Lipid-coated magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles doped with cerium dioxide (LMC) ICH Intracerebral injection of LMC can directly reach the area around the hematoma and be phagocytosed by macrophages. By reducing the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, it can significantly alleviate cerebral edema and can be clearly visualized in brain magnetic resonance imaging. [ 71 Perfluorooctyl-bromide nanoparticles SAH Compared with the SAH model group, PFOB nanoparticles can significantly reduce the degree of cerebral edema, decrease neuronal apoptosis, inhibit the activation of Caspase-3 and the expression of Bax, and increase the expression of Bcl-2. They can also inhibit the expressions of HIF-1α, VEGF, and BNIP3, significantly reduce the brain water content, decrease the extravasation of Evans blue, and lower the proportion of neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal region in a dose-dependent manner. [ 73 DEF-HCC–PEG nanoparticles ICH When compared with treating cells with PEG-HCC or DEF alone, DEF-HCC-PEG nanoparticles can restore the viability of heme-treated cells with significantly higher efficiency. At the same time, they can significantly reduce the levels of DNA damage markers γH2AX and p-53BP1, effectively prevent the heme-induced plasmid DNA strand breaks in vitro. Moreover, DEF-HCC-PEG has the characteristic of inhibiting the sensitivity of cells to ferroptosis. In in vivo experiments featuring treatment with DEF-HCC-PEG nanoparticles, the integrity of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes is significantly restored, and the expression levels of senescence-related factors ANKRD1, EDN1, p21, and PVRL4 are significantly decreased. [ 74 SAPNS ICH SAPNS significantly reduces the formation of the cerebral cavity after ICH, inhibits apoptosis, and improves the recovery of sensorimotor function. [ 75 tFNAs SAH tFNA in situ alleviated the damage caused by SAH, restored the number of BMECs and intercellular junctions in the endothelial layer, inhibited cell apoptosis, promoted angiogenesis, and improved neurological function. [ 76 JetPEI nanoparticles loaded with miR-195 ICH JetPEI nanoparticles loaded with miR-195 significantly reduced brain edema, lesion volume, and blood–brain barrier leakage in ICH mice and improved neurological function scores. [ 77 Tat-GS nanoparticles loaded with CGRP gene SAH The continuous expression of CGRP in endothelial cells by Tat-GS nanoparticles encapsulating pLXSN-CGRP was 1.71 times that of gelatin-siloxane nanoparticles encapsulating pLXSN-CGRP and 6.92 times that of naked pLXSN-CGRP. Moreover, the group treated with Tat-GS nanoparticles encapsulating pLXSN-CGRP had better neurological function outcomes and less vasospasm. [ 78 REP-mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles ICH Compared with the ICH group and the REP group, mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with REP significantly reduced the hematoma volume after ICH, alleviated neuronal degeneration, necrosis, and iron overload deposition, and improved the motor coordination function of ICH mice. [ 79 OX26-PEG-Se nanoparticles SAH Compared with the control group, epidural injection of OX26-PEG-Se nanoparticles could significantly reduce the levels of serum inflammatory factors NSE and S100B and the vasoconstrictor factor ET1, and upregulate the expression of the vasodilator factor NOS, thereby significantly improving the motor function of the SAH model and reducing the risk of nerve injury. [ 80 15d-PGJ2-MNPs ICH Under magnetic targeting guidance, 15d-PGJ2-MNPs could be effectively enriched in the brains of ICH mice, and the combination with focused ultrasound (FUS) further achieved a stable and uniform distribution of the drug. Mechanistic studies showed that the diffused 15d-PGJ2-MNPs were more likely to activate PPARγ, thereby enhancing the phagocytic ability of microglia towards hematomas. Compared with the ICH control group, the hematoma volume in the 15d-PGJ2-MNPs + magnetic targeting + FUS treatment group was significantly reduced on the 3rd day, almost completely cleared on the 7th day, and the morphology of the brain tissue around the hematoma recovered better. [ 82 PSL-IL10 nanoparticles ICH PSL-IL10 significantly inhibited the activation of glial cells, enhanced the phagocytic function of microglia/macrophages, accelerated hematoma absorption, and improved neurological function. [ 83 PLGA nanoparticles loaded with EGF and FGF ICH Core–shell structured hydrogel system: The rapidly degradable low-molecular-weight keratin hydrogel serves as the shell to remove iron overload, while the high-molecular-weight keratin hydrogel encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles loaded with EGF and FGF acts as the core to support the growth of BMSCs. The core–shell structure can not only effectively reduce the intracellular iron load and protect BMSCs from hemoglobin toxicity, but also significantly alleviate brain edema and brain atrophy by efficiently removing iron deposits in hematomas, promote the differentiation of BMSCs into neurons, and ultimately improve limb dysfunction. [ 85 Ir-MNA-modified human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells ICH Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells modified with Ir-MNA nanoparticles can be targeted and enriched in cerebral hemorrhage foci, achieving more significant brain protection effects by inhibiting neuroinflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and alleviating mitochondrial damage.
