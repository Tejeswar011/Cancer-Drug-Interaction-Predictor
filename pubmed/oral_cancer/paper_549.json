Background & Aims The RESORCE trial confirmed regorafenib as a second-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who tolerated sorafenib. However, its safety and efficacy in patients with diverse treatment histories remain unknown. The REGAIN study sought to assess regorafenib in patients not included in the RESORCE trial. Methods This single-center, randomized, open-label, dose-comparison trial included patients with HCC who had previously received sorafenib 200 mg/day or 400 mg every other day (Arm A), lenvatinib (Arm B), or atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Arm C). Patients were randomly assigned to receive regorafenib at the standard (160 mg/day) or reduced (80 mg/day) starting dose. For early safety assessment, discontinuation as the result of adverse events (AEs) during the first cycle among the first six patients in each dose group was defined as a measure of evaluation. The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP), and efficacy was evaluated using mRECIST. Results Thirty-six patients were enrolled (12 per arm). Although the study did not reach its originally planned sample size, it provided safety and exploratory efficacy data. Discontinuation in the first cycle as a result of AEs was observed in one patient (Arm C, standard-dose group). The efficacy outcomes were comparable between the standard- and reduced-dose groups: median TTP was 4.6 vs. p vs. p vs. p Conclusions Regorafenib can be safely administered with varying treatment histories. Further investigation is warranted to validate the clinical utility of reduced starting dose, which may optimize treatment strategies for advanced HCC in real-world settings. Impact and implications Sequencing and extending systemic therapies can improve the prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but comprehensive evidence on second-line and subsequent treatments remains limited. This study evaluated regorafenib in modern clinical scenarios, including patients intolerant to sorafenib and those previously treated with lenvatinib or atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Regorafenib was safely administered at 160 mg/day and 80 mg/day, and an exploratory efficacy analysis found no significant difference between the two starting doses. These findings support the integration of regorafenib into personalized treatment strategies for advanced HCC, providing physicians specializing in liver cancer treatment with greater flexibility in selecting appropriate therapeutic sequences while also expanding treatment options for patients facing increasingly limited systemic therapy choices.

[1] [2] [3] 4 , 5 [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Since the late 2000s, systemic therapy for advanced HCC has significantly evolved, with sorafenib becoming the standard of care. 11 12 [13] [14] [15] 16 [17] [18] [19] Regorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, inhibits several enzymes involved in tumor angiogenesis, oncogenesis, and the tumor microenvironment. 20 , 21 17 22 Recently, it was proposed that sequencing and extending systemic therapies could improve the prognosis in patients with advanced HCC. 23 Patients and methods Patients The REGAIN study included patients aged 20 and up who had a confirmed diagnosis of HCC as determined by histology, cytology, or standard radiologic evaluation. Eligibility was restricted to those who were ineligible for curative resection or local ablation and were unlikely to benefit from transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Essential inclusion criteria included a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, Child–Pugh class A liver function. Patients also had to have at least one measurable lesion according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors for HCC (mRECIST) and RECIST version 1.1. Patients must have been diagnosed with HCC based on either of the following assessments: histological or cytological diagnosis of HCC or radiographic image diagnosis of HCC by the typical findings of a hypervascular tumor on dynamic computed tomography (CT), CT hepatic arteriography/CT arterial portography (CTHA/CTAP), or dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To determine eligibility, baseline laboratory tests were performed, including white blood cell count, neutrophil count, hemoglobin, platelet count, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine, and coagulation function. In this study, patients who had previously received sorafenib at a dose of 200 mg/day but had significant tumor progression, lenvatinib, or atezolizumab plus bevacizumab were enrolled. In our study, we considered sex as a biological variable in the design, analysis, and interpretation of the data. Exclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with another malignancy in the past 3 years, significant or uncontrolled cardiovascular problems, renal failure requiring dialysis, ongoing bacterial infections, grade 2 or higher encephalopathy, uncontrolled ascites, esophagogastric varices requiring treatment or with a history of rupture, a thromboembolic event within the last 6 months, a urine protein level of 3 or greater, and those whose HBV DNA quantification reflects a sensitivity at or above the detection threshold without using a nucleotide analog. Oversight The research for this study was funded by Bayer Yakuhin Ltd (Osaka, Japan). The study adhered to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was conducted as a specified clinical trial following Japan’s Clinical Trial Act (jRCTs031190103). Every patient provided written informed consent. On January 23rd, 2019, Chiba University’s Certified Clinical Research Review Board approved the REGAIN study. An independent member of the efficacy and safety committee reviewed the data and discussed whether the study should be continued. Trial design and endpoints This trial was a single-center, randomized controlled, dose-comparison study conducted at Chiba University Hospital in Japan. The study was an open-labelled trial and was not blinded. Unlike conventional comparative studies, we assessed each regimen separately within a randomized framework of standard-dose and reduced-dose groups. Patients were recruited into three arms ( Fig. 1 vs. vs. Fig. 1 Patient flow of the REGAIN study. Atezo/Bev, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab; LEN, lenvatinib; REG, regorafenib; SOR, sorafenib. Fig. 1 As an early safety indicator to evaluate the appropriateness of each treatment arm and starting dose, we pre-specified an assessment of treatment discontinuation as a result of AEs during the first cycle for the first six consecutively enrolled patients in both the standard-dose and reduced-dose groups. The early safety data were assessed by an independent data monitoring committee, in full accordance with the pre-specified study protocol and statistical analysis plan. The primary goal of this study was to determine the time to progression (TTP) in patients with advanced HCC who were not eligible for the RESORCE trial. Secondary safety endpoints included the incidence of AEs and the rate of treatment discontinuation due to AEs. The secondary efficacy endpoints were PFS and OS. The protocol specified that the trial would include a safety assessment with six patients in each of the standard-dose and reduced-dose starting groups. This safety assessment was carried out by two independent members of the data monitoring committee, using data collected at the end of the first course of regorafenib treatment. Concurrently, it was agreed that the committee would be consulted on whether to proceed with enrollment of up to a pre-determined number of patients to evaluate the primary endpoints separately in the standard-dose and reduced-dose starting groups. The study was not designed to directly compare the two dose groups, and enrollment could continue in only one group if necessary. Enrollment in both groups could also be discontinued. The safety evaluation process was carried out separately for each of the three arms. Safety was continuously assessed using vital signs and clinical laboratory test results as well as to assess the incidence and severity of AEs using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Radiological evaluations were performed using contrast CT or MRI at baseline, the first 4 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Statistical analysis The primary aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of regorafenib, with a focus on TTP, in both the standard-dose and reduced-dose starting groups among patients with advanced HCC who were not assessed in the RESORCE trial. In the RESORCE trial, the median TTP assessed using mRECIST was 3.1 months in the regorafenib group and 1.5 months in the placebo group. 17 24 The safety assessment will be conducted after six patients in the standard starting-dose group and six patients in the reduced starting-dose group of each arm have completed first cycle. Twelve patients in each arm of each group (six patients in each group) were included in the safety assessment; six is the size typically used to determine the frequency and trends of serious AEs from a small number of individuals and is an appropriate sample size to balance the timeliness of the study and the safety assessment. The safety assessment will be performed for each arm. The rate of discontinuation as a result of AEs in the first course will be assessed in six consecutive patients from the start of enrollment in both the standard starting-dose group and the reduced starting-dose group. The safety assessment will be reviewed by the independent data monitoring committee. The primary endpoint of this study, TTP, is defined as the period from the date of randomization to the date of confirmation of progressive disease (PD) based on mRECIST criteria, and will be analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method. For individuals who die before confirmation of PD or who are alive at the time of the last observation without PD confirmed by imaging, the date of the last imaging evaluation confirming the absence of PD will be considered as the censoring date. OS is defined as the period from the date of randomization to the date of death (regardless of the cause of death). For those who are lost to follow-up, the date of the last confirmed survival will be considered the censoring date. Kaplan–Meier estimation will be used to estimate the survival rate. The Pearson Χ 2 p Supplementary CTAT Table Results Study overview and patient characteristics Informed consent was provided by 38 patients between September 2019 and September 2022. However, one patient was excluded because his liver function deteriorated during the screening period, rendering him ineligible for inclusion before randomization. Additionally, another patient was assigned to the standard-dose group of Arm A but did not receive regorafenib because of a deterioration in his overall condition, including fever. Consequently, the remaining 36 patients (12 in each arm) received the investigational drug ( Fig. 1 Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics.

Following the start of the study treatment, all 36 patients underwent a safety analysis after 1 month of monitoring. This study examined the rate of discontinuation in the first cycle because of AEs in patients starting on either the standard or reduced dose of regorafenib in each arm. As illustrated in Fig. 2 Fig. S1 Considering the registration status of the trial, the trial’s independent data monitoring committee recommended to halt enrollment before the start of the efficacy phase. This recommendation was influenced by the approval of several new agents for the treatment of advanced HCC since the trial began, as well as the wide range of treatment options available in clinical practice. The committee reasoned that enrolling additional patients in a trial designed to assess the efficacy of specific pre-treatment regimens would be difficult and could lengthen the trial unnecessarily. Given the wide range of agents now available in clinical practice for the treatment of HCC, the committee prioritized gathering safety data on the use of regorafenib in various treatment regimens. This approach was deemed the most appropriate, especially given the need to validate the safety of regorafenib at doses not tested in the RESORCE trial. Although the study did not reach the sample size originally planned, it provided the safety profile and exploratory data on efficacy. The study was completed in December 2022, with a median follow-up of 10.5 months, and it successfully met its goal of confirming the safety profile of regorafenib across various doses and treatment histories.

AE, adverse event; mRECIST, modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors for HCC. Fig. 2 Seventeen patients (94.4%) in the standard-dose starting group and 14 patients (77.8%) in the reduced-dose starting group had to modify or discontinue their dose because of AEs. The most common AEs that led to these adjustments were hand–foot skin reaction, fatigue, and elevation of AST and ALT in the standard-dose group, and hand–foot skin reaction, fatigue, and proteinuria in the reduced-dose group. Although abnormal laboratory values of increased lipase and hypophosphatemia were observed, these were of minor clinical significance and did not require discontinuation or dose adjustment. The median time to first dose modification or interruption was 6 days for patients in the standard-dose starting group and 7 days for patients in the reduced-dose starting group, with the former taking significantly less time to intervene. Further analysis of average daily doses throughout the treatment period, particularly during the first cycle, revealed that the standard-dose starting group had higher average daily doses than the reduced-dose starting group. However, it is worth noting that dose variability was also greater in the standard-dose starting cohort ( Fig. 4 Fig. 3 Incidence of treatment-related adverse events with regorafenib in standard- and reduced-dose starting group. Fig. 3 Efficacy of regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC in the present study Although the study did not achieve the target sample size initially planned for the efficacy analysis of the pre-specified primary endpoint, an exploratory efficacy analysis was conducted. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC, comparing outcomes between those given a standard starting dose and those given a reduced starting dose. The median TTP (mRECIST) for patients in the standard-dose starting group was 4.6 months (95% CI 2.6–10.3), whereas for the reduced-dose starting group, it was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.8–6.5, p p vs. p Fig. 5 Table 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 4 Transition of average daily dose for standard-dose starting group and reduced-dose starting group.

Changes in dose intensity of regorafenib and its impact on treatment duration and efficacy We performed an additional analysis to evaluate the dose intensity and treatment duration between groups. The median dose of regorafenib in each group is described in Table S2 Fig. S2 Regarding treatment duration, the median treatment duration across all study arms was 3.6 months (95% CI 2.7–6.5). When comparing treatment duration by starting-dose group, the median duration was 3.5 months (95% CI 2.7–14.2) in the standard-dose group and 3.6 months (95% CI 2.7–10.3) in the reduced-dose group ( p In addition, we performed a Kaplan–Meier analysis to assess whether TTP (mRECIST) differed based on RDI. The median RDI at weeks 1–4, 1–8, and 1–12 was 50.0%, 47.0%, and 45.2%, respectively. Using the median RDI as a threshold, we performed a Kaplan–Meier analysis to evaluate the effect of dose intensity on TTP ( Fig. S3 Efficacy analysis results compared by arm Although this study was based on a limited sample size, we observed differences in prognosis based on prior treatment regimens. In Table 2 p Fig. S4 Subsequent treatment selection after regorafenib discontinuation To further examine post-interventional treatment patterns, we conducted a supplementary analysis evaluating subsequent therapies administered after completion of study treatment. Of the 33 patients who completed study treatment, 21 patients (63.6%) received subsequent therapy. Of these, 20 patients (Arm A: 6/11 [54.5%], Arm B 9/11 [81.8%], Arm C: 5/11 [45.5%]) received systemic therapy and one patient received hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. The distribution of post-treatment regimens by study arm is shown in Fig. S5 Discussion The REGAIN study investigated new roles for regorafenib in the changing landscape of systemic therapy for advanced HCC. This trial established three arms to reflect modern clinical scenarios not investigated in the RESORCE trial: patients who could not tolerate sorafenib at doses <400 mg, those who had previously received lenvatinib, and those who had previously received atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy. The study found that regorafenib could be safely administered at 160 mg/day and 80 mg/day doses in all three arms. Although the trial was unable to confirm the efficacy of regorafenib in each individual arm because of insufficient sample sizes, an exploratory efficacy analysis combining data from patients enrolled in all three arms revealed no significant difference in efficacy between starting regorafenib at 160 mg or 80 mg. These findings lay the groundwork for regorafenib to be considered a viable option in various treatment sequences for advanced HCC in today’s medical landscape. In this study, patients in each of the three arms were randomly assigned to either the standard-dose (160 mg) or the reduced-dose (80 mg) starting group. Within the first 4 weeks of treatment initiation, there were no safety concerns in either the standard-dose or reduced-dose starting groups across all arms. Regorafenib was initially developed to treat advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors and colorectal cancer, and it showed efficacy in phase III trials. 25 , 26 [27] [28] [29] 17 20 30 The AEs associated with regorafenib in our trial were almost identical to those reported in the RESORCE trial and other previous studies. 17 , 30 Fig. 4 In an exploratory analysis, we compared TTP, PFS, and OS in patients who started regorafenib at the standard dose vs. 31 et al. 28 17 , 30 , 31 et al. 32 vs. In the most recent treatment paradigms, combination immunotherapy, which includes atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, is the first line of treatment for advanced HCC. [33] [34] [35] [36] 37 , 38 Table 1 In particular, 10 of 12 patients in Arm B and 11 of 12 patients in Arm C discontinued prior therapy because of PD. Arm C had the highest proportion of patients with key prognostic factors, including MVI, which may have contributed to differences in OS. The occurrence of MVI or EHM during prior treatment was also most frequent in Arm C ( Table 1 [39] [40] [41] 42 Our study has several limitations. First, the study did not reach the originally planned sample size required for a robust evaluation of the primary endpoint, TTP. However, it provided valuable insights into the safety profile of the treatment. It is important to acknowledge that the efficacy analysis was exploratory and based on a limited number of cases, further validation of efficacy requires a larger sample size to ensure statistical reliability. Second, local regulatory restrictions limit the use of regorafenib to patients previously treated with sorafenib, influencing the sequence of regorafenib administration. These constraints may affect the applicability of our findings in regions with different regulatory frameworks. Third, the analysis of serum levels of regorafenib and its metabolites was originally planned. However, as a result of unforeseen technical and logistical challenges, such as the unavailability of key reagents and the inability to establish a reliable experimental system within the required timeframe, we were unable to conduct this analysis as originally planned. Despite these limitations, our study offers meaningful data on the safety and feasibility of regorafenib, highlighting the need for further research with a larger cohort to confirm its efficacy in this setting. The REGAIN study sheds valuable insights into the safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients with advanced HCC who were not adequately represented in the RESORCE trial. This study shows that regorafenib can be safely administered in patients with various pre-treatment histories, including prior use of sorafenib, lenvatinib, and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. The findings suggest that initiating regorafenib at a reduced dose of 80 mg may be a reasonable treatment option, not only in terms of early safety, but also considering potential efficacy. Nevertheless, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate the clinical utility of this reduced starting dose. While the efficacy results remain exploratory, this approach has the potential to refine treatment strategies for advanced HCC in real-world clinical practice. More research is needed to confirm these findings and optimize the sequencing of regorafenib with other systemic therapies to improve patient outcomes in advanced HCC.
