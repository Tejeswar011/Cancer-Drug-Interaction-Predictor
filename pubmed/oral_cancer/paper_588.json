Clarifying their perspectives and experiences during discharge is important to support their needs. However, a unified and thorough understanding of patients' experiences and needs is lacking. Objective To identify and synthesise knowledge of the experiences and needs of elderly patients with multi‐morbidity during discharge from hospital to home. Method A qualitative meta‐synthesis was conducted using Sandelowski and Barroso's method. In December 2022, relevant studies applying appropriate criteria were searched in Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and PROQUEST. A follow‐up search was conducted in October 2024. Results Nine studies were included, and four analytical themes were identified: the feeling of getting life back, the importance of next of kin, relationships with healthcare professionals preparation for homecoming Conclusion Short‐term relations with healthcare professionals during discharge planning posed challenges in meeting some patients' relational needs and thus affected their preparation for going home. To promote a better patient relationship during discharge planning, healthcare professionals should increase their focus on patients' preferences and needs when communicating with patients using a strategy appropriate for the healthcare context. discharge elderly experiences literature review meta‐synthesis multi‐morbidity needs The University of Southern Denmark Zealand University Hospital 10.13039/501100012689 The Health Science Research Fund in Region Zealand The Danish Company for Nursing Research. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:28.09.2025  S.

To our knowledge, one study has solely investigated elderly patients' experiences of discharge from hospital to home [ 22 23 24 25 26 26 24 22 2 Objective The study aimed to identify and synthesise knowledge of the experiences and needs of elderly patients with multi‐morbidity during discharge from hospital to home. 2.1 Method 2.1.1 Design The review and qualitative meta‐synthesis followed the approach outlined by Sandelowski and Barroso [ 27 27 2.1.2 Comprehensive Search According to Sandelowski and Barroso [ 27 27  Topical  Population 28  Temporal  Methodological 27 27 The search was done in Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and PROQUEST. A reference librarian from a health sciences library was consulted to select keywords and organise the search strategy to ensure a comprehensive search in all databases [ 27 S1 29 30 Studies were excluded if (a) the patients' experiences were not separately reported because it would make it impossible to identify patients' perspectives, (b) the patients were in the terminal phase or included surgical patients because their discharge process is specific, (c) the patients were discharged to other places than their home due to their dependency on care, and (d) the study findings were classified as No Findings or the study had questionable value [ 27 Appraisal of primary qualitative studies Footnote chasing, citation searching, author searching, and area scanning were used to identify further studies. Footnotes in the reference list of reports, studies, books, and anthologies were reviewed until citation redundancy was achieved. Citations were searched in the citation database Web of Science to find similar articles. Web of Science was chosen as it provides access to citations within science, medicine, and social sciences in peer‐reviewed journals, conference papers, books, and more [ 31 32 S2 2.2 Search Outcomes The first author screened the studies, and the inclusion of studies was determined after a full‐text screening by the first and the last author. Next, an overview of included and excluded studies was presented to the research team, and the reasons for exclusion were explained by the first author. The research team reviewed the included studies according to their aims and methods and agreed upon them through discussion in the research team. A flow diagram (Figure 1 33 34 FIGURE 1 Flow diagram for summarising the study selection process.

Study Overall appraisal Reason for appraisal Schjødt et al. [ 35 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning what researchers knew/believed, or came to know/believe. However, it visualised the analysis process, described the study setting, and presented detailed findings according to current practice. Facchinetti et al. [ 36 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning what researchers knew/believed or came to know/believe, validation techniques, and a frame of reference. However, it included the researcher's reflections on the rigour and data saturation. Kumlin et al. [ 37 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning what researchers knew/believed or came to know/believe, validation techniques, and a frame of reference, and it did not present findings in a parallel fashion. However, it provided deep insight into each patient's case and considered their influence. Lilleheie et al. [ 38 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning what researchers knew/believed, or came to know/believe. However, it provided comprehensive patient characteristics linked to the quotations. Allen et al. [ 39 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning the period for data collection, what the researchers knew/believed or came to know/believe, the researchers' awareness of their influence, and validation techniques. However, the authors discussed and interrogated codes, categories, and themes to evaluate data interpretations. Backman et al. [ 40 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning what researchers knew/believed or came to know/believe, the researchers' awareness of their influence, and techniques for validation. However, data were individually and collectively analysed and discussed, and the findings contained in‐depth perspectives of participants. Dyrstad et al. [ 41 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning what researchers knew/believed, or came to know/believe. However, it included the researcher's reflections on observer effects and bias, and the findings contained elderly patients' experiences. Neiterman et al. [ 42 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning what researchers knew/believed or came to know/believe, validation techniques, the orientation toward the target phenomenon, the site of recruitment, and it had questionable sources of data and data collection methods. However, the study included, for example, consideration of patients' preferences for the interviews and described short‐and long‐term challenges with transition in findings. Cain et al. [ 43 Acceptable The study lacked information concerning what researchers knew/believed or came to know/believe, the researchers' awareness of their influence. However, for example, multiple observers and a researcher who did not attend the interviews analysed and discussed the data, and the findings contained detailed patient‐centered perspectives. 2.4 Classification of Findings Findings from the included studies were classified by the first author using a classification typology [ 44 44 3 TABLE 3 Classification of findings. Study Typology Reason for typology Schjødt et al. [ 35 Thematic descriptions The findings consisted of an overall category and sub‐categories, including an in‐depth description of the patient's experiences. Facchinetti et al. [ 36  Thematic descriptions and Thematic survey. (Predominantly Thematic descriptions. See reason for typology) The findings described nuances of patients' experiences but did not seem very transformed, given the high number of citations. However, the findings were presented as more than just patterns by showing a narrative rendering of experiences through categories and sub‐categories. Kumlin et al. [ 37 Thematic descriptions The findings consisted of an overall description of findings, and they were reframed into broad categories, including cases that described patients' experiences. Lilleheie et al. [ 38 Thematic descriptions The findings were reframed into several themes that described nuances of patients' experiences in detail. The names of the themes reflected their content. Allen et al. [ 39 Thematic descriptions The findings were reframed into several themes that described nuances of patients' experiences in detail. The names of the themes reflected their content. Backman et al. [ 40  Thematic descriptions and Thematic survey (Predominantly Thematic descriptions. See reason for typology) The findings described nuances of patients' experiences but were very close to the data. However, findings were organised into themes and sub‐themes that did not reflect a surface classification of findings. Dyrstad et al. [ 41 Thematic descriptions The findings were reframed into broad categories that described nuances of patients' experiences in detail. The names of the categories reflected their content. Neiterman et al. [ 42 Conceptual/thematic descriptions The findings were reframed into one overarching theme and several underlying themes that described patients' experiences. Everyday language and a theoretical concept ( social capital Cain et al. [ 43 Thematic descriptions The findings were reframed into several domains that described nuances of patients' experiences in detail. The names of the domains reflected their content. 2.5 Synthesis of Findings The richness of the findings determined the synthesis method [ 45 46 45 46 47 27 47 The findings from the descriptive themes provided knowledge of patients' experiences and needs during discharge planning. However, several descriptive themes were developed through these findings and were related to each other. For example, a descriptive theme named Patient‐health professional cooperation was strongly related to the descriptive theme Relationships with healthcare professionals. Thus, though analytical themes in the third synthesis stage are unnecessary if the findings align with the study's aim [ 47 3 Findings 3.1 Study Characteristics The synthesis included nine studies (Table 3 39 40 42 35 36 37 38 41 43 35 36 37 38 39 41 42 40 43 35 36 38 39 42 40 37 41 43 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 43 3.2 The Analytical Themes Based on the thematic synthesis, the following analytical themes were identified: the feeling of getting life back, the importance of next of kin, relationships with healthcare professionals preparation for homecoming 2 FIGURE 2 Analytical themes. 3.2.1 The Feeling of Getting Life Back During discharge planning, some patients expressed excitement about going home. They were tired of hospitalisation and could finally see the “light at the end of the tunnel” ([ 36 36 43  I was so anxious to leave. I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, let's do this. I'm all packed. I've got one foot out the door.’ At home, I got ready to take my medication; the discharge instructions didn't jibe with what the doctor wrote. It was as much my fault as anyone's because I was rushing to get home 43 36 41 36 36 36 3.2.2 The Importance of Next of kin The next of kin supported the patients by planning assistive devices before discharge [ 42 35 36 41 35  Well, it means a lot because four ears hear better than two. Sometimes, you don't feel well, and then you don't get all the information, right? 35 35 39 35 41 3.2.3 Relationships With Healthcare Professionals Patients experienced caring nurses and trusted the healthcare professionals' opinions about treatment and health during discharge planning [ 36 36 37 39 43 35 35 37 The communication between patients and healthcare professionals affected some patients' involvement in discharge planning and their understanding of the plan after discharge. Three studies showed that patients had trouble understanding and recalling what the doctor said [ 35 37 41 35 39 40 38 41  It was easy to understand the oral information from the doctor, but in the written documents, professional medical language was used, and it was hard to understand. The doctor did not explain the content of the written paper and I am not sure about further treatment, but I think I'm supposed to take antibiotics at home 41 35 41 43 35 41 35 36 39  I believe it's their job to make sure that we meet in some way. Well, dialogue sounds so fancy, but we meet anyway in a way that we both feel that we have done something for each other 35 39 36 3.2.4 Preparation for Homecoming In the studies by Dyrstad et al. [ 41 37 37 39 43 39 43 38 40 41 42 40 42  I didn't know what to do. I was near tears at one point because I just didn't know what to do…and then I got a little agitated with the doctor because, you know, they're telling me one thing and then something else, and it just…emotionally, it…I didn'tknow whether to cry or scream 40 35 36 38  It's okay that they decide. Because you are so tired. And, after all, it is the doctors' decision 38 35 39 37 39 41 In five studies [ 35 36 38 39 40 36 35 36 38 39 39 40 40 36 4 Discussion This meta‐synthesis of nine qualitative studies [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 the feeling of getting life back, the importance of next of kin, relationships with healthcare professionals preparation for homecoming 48 49 50 Other reasons for not being involved could be trust in authorities [ 48 51 52 23 53 54 35 55 25 Our findings showed how organisational factors often affected discharge planning. Some patients experienced being moved to other wards or discharged due to a lack of beds. Another study showed that the need to free up beds dominated decisions about discharging elderly patients with complex diseases [ 56 57 53 58 58 21 59 60 61 62 59 59 60 63 64 5 Strengths and Limitations According to Sandelowski and Barros's [ 27 27 27 27 27 27 6 Conclusion This meta‐synthesis provided a fully integrated description of the experiences and needs of elderly patients with multi‐morbidity when discharged from the hospital to home. Short‐term relations with healthcare professionals during discharge planning posed challenges in meeting some patients' relational needs and thus affected their preparation for going home. To promote a better patient relationship during discharge planning, healthcare professionals should increase their focus on patients' preferences and needs when communicating with patients. However, communication success might require considering the healthcare professionals' context, as organisational factors can influence the patients' discharge planning. Further studies are needed to develop and test strategies for discharge planning that include patients' perspectives and are appropriate for the healthcare context. Future research could involve patients and healthcare professionals in developing a communication tool focused solely on patients' needs. This tool could help patients express their needs during discharge planning while helping healthcare professionals identify patients' needs more efficiently within the clinical context.
