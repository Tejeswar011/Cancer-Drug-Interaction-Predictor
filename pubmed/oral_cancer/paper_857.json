Introduction Natural compounds extracted from plants have been developed as biologically active modulators [ 1 2 3 4 1 5 2 3 6 7 8 3 3 7 6 9 10 11 Cancer immunotherapy suppresses tumor growth by activating immune cells to attack tumor cells [ 12 13 14 12 12 13 15 16 DCs are potent antigen-presenting cells that link innate and adaptive immunity [ 16 16 17 Research on DC is being conducted more actively in vitro than in vivo; however, substantial differences remain between DCs, making it difficult to apply information on in vitro DC activity to in vivo research [ 18 18 12 We previously confirmed the immune-activating ability of fucoidans extracted from Durvillaea antarctica 6 D. antarctica 6 6 6 19 2. Results 2.1. Nasal Administration of DAF Induced Migration of DCs to the mLN Since intraperitoneal administration of DAF induced splenic DC activation in our previous study [ 6 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure S1 2.2. Nasal Administration of DAF Promoted Activation of mLN DCs Next, we examined the activation of mLN DC following nasal administration of DAF. The mLN DCs were divided into CD8-positive cDC1 and CD8-negative cDC2 ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure S2 Figure S3 Figure S3 Figure S3 2.3. Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Production by Nasal Administration of DAF in the Lungs and Blood The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, another important indicator of DC activity [ 20 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.4. DAF Promoted Activation of T Cells in mLN Because nasal administration of DAF activates DCs in the mLN, we next examined whether it could induce T cell activation in the mLN. DAF (50 mg/kg) was administered intranasally twice at 3 d intervals, and the mLN were harvested 3 d after the final administration to confirm T-cell activity. Treatment with DAF induced the intracellular production of IFN-γ and TNF-α in CD4 T cells of mLN, at levels similar to those of the positive control group (LPS) ( Figure 4 Figure S4A Figure 4 Figure S4B Figure 4 Figure S4C Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure S4D 2.5. Nasal Administration of DAF Enhanced the Anticancer Effect of Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Based on the DC and T-cell activation abilities of DAF, we examined its adjuvant effects on anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Lung cancer was induced in C57BL6 mice by administering Lewis lung carcinoma 2 (LL2) cells via the tail vein. DAF and anti-PD-L1 antibodies were administered at 3 d intervals starting 7 d later. DAF was administered intranasally at a concentration of 50 mg/kg, and anti-PD-L1 antibody was administered intraperitoneally at a concentration of 10 mg/kg. All mice in the control group administered PBS died 18 d after tumor administration, whereas mice in the control group administered DAF and anti-PD-L1 antibody survived for 23 and 24 d, respectively ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 3. Discussion The immunomodulatory properties of fucoidans have been confirmed in several studies [ 2 6 7 8 11 21 Fucus vesiculosus 22 23 10 24 F. vesiculosus 22 23 24 6 The efficacy of fucoidans varies greatly depending on the type of natural product being extracted. In previous studies, we compared and analyzed the immunoregulatory properties of different types of fucoidans [ 3 21 22 10 24 Immune checkpoint inhibitors are recognized as groundbreaking cancer treatments [ 25 25 26 26 27 28 29 6 30 6 30 6 11 DCs are critical for T-cell activation [ 18 31 17 18 20 32 Fucoidans bind to various receptors. The Toll-like receptor (TLR), scavenger receptor (SR), and Dectin-1 are representative examples [ 33 34 6 6 In this study, we demonstrated that DAF, which has immune-activating properties, enhances the anticancer effect of the anti-PD-L1 antibody and inhibits the growth of lung cancer. However, it is unknown whether the results derived from this study can be applied to human tumors, which are in a state such as immune-desert or immune-cold tumors, where it is difficult for immune cells to penetrate [ 35 36 37 35 38 35 38 Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a direct role in the activation of immune cells and elimination of pathogens, but are also known to induce inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [ 39 40 41 42 Oral administration of fucoidan is being studied most actively. Studies on immune activation and regulation have investigated the effects of intraperitoneal and intravenous administration. This may be because the abdominal cavity and blood are rich in immune cells, allowing fucoidan to be delivered directly to these cells. Therefore, in this study, DAF was administered nasally rather than orally to confirm the lung immune activity. When DAF was administered orally, no changes in lung immunity were observed, whereas when DAF was administered nasally, DC activity in the mLN was confirmed, leading to its application in lung cancer immunotherapy. Following intraperitoneal administration in a previous study, we investigated pulmonary immune activation following nasal administration of DAF in this study. The results suggested that DAF functions as an immune-activating adjuvant in tumor treatment. Compared with research on tumors, research on infectious diseases using immune activity is lacking. To develop vaccines or treatments for infectious diseases, it is necessary to induce specific immune activities against antigens. Therefore, we plan to verify the induction of antigen-specific immune activity using DAF and experimental antigens such as ovalbumin, and to conduct research on the development of therapeutic or preventive vaccines for infectious diseases. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Mice C57BL/6 mice (18 ± 0.2 g) were purchased from Orient Bio (Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea). The mice were provided with regular food and water and housed under pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments were approved and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Asan Medical Center (Protocol number: 2023-20-260). 4.2. Cell Line LL2 cells (passage 25) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 1 M HEPES at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 4.3. Reagents and Antibodies The DAF collected along the coast of Argentine Patagonia was purchased from Elicityl (Crolles, France). The purity of the DAF was 87%. The chemical and monosaccharide composition of DAF was characterized in our previous study [ 6 4.4. Nasal Treatment Using DAF For intranasal administration of DAF, the nape of the neck of C57BL/6 mice was held between the index and ring fingers. After holding the mouse’s head to prevent it from moving, the mice were flipped over with their tails pointing upward and received nasal inhalation of 50 mg/kg/50 μL of DAF. The drug was administered by placing a drop at the tip of the pipette as slowly as possible to prevent the drug from entering the mouth. After all drugs were administered, the mice were held upside down for approximately 2 min to ensure drug absorption. 4.5. DC Analysis in mLN DAF was administered to C57BL/6 mice, and the mLN were harvested 24 h later. The mLN were ground on a glass slide and washed with cold PBS. The pellet was resuspended in cold PBS and stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies. The mLN cells were stained with lineage Abs, anti-CD8α, and anti-CD11c. The lineage antibodies used were against CD90.1, CD3, Gr-1, B220, CD49b, and TER-119. mLN cDCs were analyzed for CD11c + 4.6. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was measured in the BAL after the administration of 50 mg/kg DAF and LPS. An ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, the capture antibody for the corresponding cytokine was coated onto a 96-well plate the day before analysis, and non-specific binding was blocked for 2 h with blocking buffer containing fetal bovine serum. The samples were loaded and incubated for 2 h. After washing five times, the detection antibody was added and incubated for 1 h. After washing five times, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added and incubated for 30 min. Color development was monitored by adding a substrate and analyzed using a plate reader (Hangzhou Allsheng Instruments Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China) after adding the stop solution. 4.7. Intracellular Cytokine Staining The mLN cells were incubated with 2 μM of monensin solution (BioLegend) for 2 h. Cell viability was assessed using a Zombie Violet Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend). The cells were then stained with anti-TCR-β, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 + + + + + 4.8. Lung Cancer Model and Treatment C57BL/6 mice were administered 2 × 10 5 4.9. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Staining The lungs were fixed on day 15 after LL2 cell injection by injecting 1 mL of 3.7% formaldehyde into the lungs and then harvested. Harvested lungs were incubated in 3.7% formaldehyde for 24 h, followed by dehydration using acetone and chloroform. The lung tissue was embedded in paraffin, sectioned into 5 μm slices, and attached to a glass slide. After drying, the sections were rehydrated with xylene and observed under a microscope after staining with hematoxylin and eosin. 4.10. CD4-Positive and CD8-Positive Cell Depletion Starting on day 6 after tumor administration, anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies (both 10 mg/kg) were administered at 2 d intervals. Starting 7 d after tumor administration, 50 mg/kg DAF was intranasally administered at 3 d intervals, and the survival of the mice was observed. 4.11. Statistical Analysis All results are expressed as the mean and standard error of the mean. Unless otherwise stated, the experiments were repeated twice, and six samples were analyzed (n = 6). Statistical significance was evaluated using one-way analysis of variance and calculated using Tukey’s test. Statistical significance was set at p 5. Conclusions Based on the immune activity of DAF following intraperitoneal administration, the pulmonary immune activity induced by intranasal administration was verified. Nasal administration of DAF induced the activation of cDC1 and cDC2 in the mLN, as well as potent CTL activation. Nasal administration of DAF inhibited lung cancer growth, and combined administration with anti-PD-L1 showed more potent inhibition of lung cancer growth. Thus, DAF can be used as an immune-activating adjuvant that induces lung immune activity and is expected to enhance the function of immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer treatment.
