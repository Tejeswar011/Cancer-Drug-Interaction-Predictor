Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is released from activated neutrophil granules. High or increasing MPO levels are associated with tissue damage, lung function decline and increased exacerbation risk in patients with COPD. We hypothesize that treatment with mitiperstat, a novel oral MPO inhibitor, may reduce lung oxidative stress, inflammation and exacerbations, thereby improving symptoms, lung function, and comorbidities in patients with COPD. Patients and Methods CRESCENDO is a partially decentralized, Phase 2a, randomized, 24-week, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of mitiperstat versus placebo in patients (40–80 years, inclusive) with COPD at high risk of exacerbation (based on a documented history of ≥1 moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbation, frequent productive cough, or severe airflow limitation [forced expiratory volume in 1 second <50% predicted]). Patients recruited from approximately 100 sites across 14 countries, from primary or secondary care and community-based facilities, will be randomized 1:1 to receive mitiperstat 5 mg or placebo orally, once daily. The primary endpoint is the time to first CompEx event, a novel composite endpoint reflecting disease worsening, including changes in symptoms, reliever use, lung function, treatment for exacerbation, or study dropout. The study period is planned to take between 18 and 30 weeks for each patient. Conclusion CRESCENDO will assess efficacy and safety of mitiperstat using a novel, patient-centric trial design to enhance participant recruitment, partially via community-based facilities, helping to overcome restrictive trial designs and better reflect the real-world population with COPD, as well as reducing its environmental impact.

MPO is an enzyme and generates hypohalous acids, including the potent antimicrobial agent, hypochlorous acid. Under normal circumstances, MPO is intracellular and plays a vital role in antimicrobial activity, following phagocytosis, by generating oxidants and killing pathogens within the phagosome; 23 24 25 26 27 28 Mitiperstat is an orally administered, low dose, selective, irreversible MPO inhibitor, with greater potency for extracellular than intracellular MPO. 29 30 31 Methods CRESCENDO Study Design CRESCENDO is a partially decentralized, Phase 2a, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm study, with a treatment time of up to 24-weeks ( NCT05492877 Figure 1 Supplementary Table 1 Figure 1 Study design. Notes a 1 1 b Abbreviations 1 The objective of CRESCENDO is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitiperstat, compared with placebo, in patients with COPD deemed to be at risk of exacerbations. Direct patient input was obtained on study objectives, study design, and patient-facing materials (duration and burden of visits, devices, and the clinical outcome assessment setting). Ethics Approval and Informed Consent The study protocol has been approved by Independent Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards in all countries and sites involved in the trial. This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and be consistent with the International Council for Harmonization/Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements. All patients will provide written informed consent. Recruitment Both primary and secondary care research facilities and networks will be included. Extensive advice was sought from experienced primary care researchers to simplify the protocol, boost participant identification and referral, and encourage primary care practices to act as clinical sites. The study is exploring alternative community-based patient recruitment in some countries, utilizing a network of primary care and community COPD/pulmonary rehabilitation facilities to boost enrollment, including lung cancer screening programs. Where present, the established community COPD clinic/pulmonary rehabilitation infrastructure will either facilitate participant recruitment or act as new sites. Eligibility Criteria Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Figure 1 32 33 1 34 35 Interventions Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive mitiperstat 5 mg or placebo orally, once daily. All patients will receive a minimum of 12 weeks and maximum of 24 weeks of investigational product ( Figure 1 Outcomes A list of primary, secondary, and exploratory study endpoints are shown in Table 1 1 Table 1 Study Endpoints Primary Secondary Exploratory Safety Time to first CompEx 31 PK of mitiperstat Biomarkers related to neutrophils and COPD activity AEs Time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation MPO activity in spontaneous sputum SAEs Change from baseline in post-BD FEV 1 Spirometry AESIs Respiratory symptoms (EXACT, BCSS score, Cough VAS) MPO concentration in plasma and spontaneous sputum Disease impact (change from baseline in total CAT score) Abbreviations 1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the time to first CompEx event ( Figure 2 31 Figure 2 Schematic of CompEx endpoint.

This study is using the EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Tool; Cough Visual Analog Scale; Breathlessness, Cough, and Sputum Scale, and COPD Assessment Test (an 8-item questionnaire, which measures the impact of COPD on a participant’s daily life and how this may change over time). 37 Figure 3 Figure 3 Patient’s routine at home. Notes Abbreviations 1 Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected prior to administration of the study medication, and plasma concentrations will be summarized by time point in all participants. Exploratory Endpoints The effects of mitiperstat and placebo on MPO activity and concentration in spontaneous sputum, when available, and blood samples (average change from baseline to Week 12 in MPO activity normalized to MPO concentration), will be evaluated as an exploratory endpoint. Samples will also be collected to test for biomarkers related to cardiovascular comorbidities (B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and plasma fibrinogen), neutrophils, lung tissue destruction, and COPD activity to evaluate their association with observed clinical responses to mitiperstat compared with placebo. A cough sub study is being conducted in selected countries to investigate whether cough frequency is associated with lung function. The study will involve 24-hour assessment of coughs per hour using the VitaloJAK ® A patient experience interview (Study Participant Feedback Questionnaire [SPFQ] survey and Qualitative Study into Acute Worsening Events [Q-SAW]) sub study is being conducted to obtain the perceptions and experiences of study participants. This involves semi-structured interviews conducted by video/audio call via Zoom, stratified over the study duration and following a list of topics and example questions ( Supplementary Table S2 Supplementary Methods Safety Endpoints Adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and presented for each treatment group by system organ class and/or preferred term. AEs of special interest will also be evaluated, including skin reactions (maculopapular rash) and serious infections (pneumonia). These AESIs were selected for monitoring owing to the anticipated safety profile of mitiperstat for the treatment of COPD, as inhibition of MPO may lead to more infections. An overview will be presented for each treatment group. Vital signs, laboratory parameters, and electrocardiogram parameters will be assessed. Sample Size A total of 194 first CompEx events (estimated to require 203 participants per arm based on a 24-week first event risk of 55% assumed in the placebo arm) will provide 80% power at the 2-sided 10% level of statistical significance to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 in the mitiperstat arm. A screen failure rate of 40% is assumed; therefore, up to 677 participants will be screened to achieve randomization of approximately 406 participants, depending on the event-driven nature of the study. Statistical Analysis The primary endpoint is the time to first CompEx event. After at least 194 first CompEx events have occurred, enrollment will stop and, after 18 weeks, the study will end once the final enrolled subjects have completed the 4-week screening period, 12 weeks of treatment, and 2-week follow-up. A Log rank test and Cox’s proportional hazards model will be used to analyze the time to first CompEx event. Survival probabilities will be presented as survival curves estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, while the treatment effect (reported as a hazard ratio) will be presented with 90% confidence intervals. A 2-sided Log rank test p-value of ≤0.10 is required to provide evidence of efficacy. The secondary endpoint of time to first exacerbation will be analyzed using a similar approach to that used for the primary endpoint. To ensure the same event is not counted twice, concurrent moderate or severe COPD exacerbations with start and stop dates ≤7 days apart will be considered the same event. Continuous data will be summarized descriptively. Discussion The CRESCENDO study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the MPO inhibitor, mitiperstat, for COPD treatment. Mitiperstat may play a key role in reducing MPO activity, lung inflammation and exacerbations and improving symptoms in patients with COPD. 28 RCTs including patients with COPD are often limited by recruitment challenges, relating to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the demographics of the population with COPD, often leading to limited real-world applicability. 3 8 9 During early development, patients provided their thoughts on clinical trials, which guided the design to produce patient-friendly protocols and relevant endpoints (including the evaluation of chronic cough) to improve the overall trial experience for patients. This input influenced the study duration, location, timings, and procedure of visits, and choice of devices to measure endpoints and their setting, with feedback provided on virtual spirometry, patient-facing materials and practical aspects of safety monitoring. All decisions aim to reduce the patient burden, and a standardized protocol complexity tool was used to assess the proposed protocol and subsequent input, and it demonstrated significant reduction in visit burden and improvements related to time. Additionally, the patient experience interview sub study should provide information on the overall patient experience of the trial, including virtual visits. The study recruitment method involves collaboration between clinician investigators from primary and specialist centers, the sponsoring pharmaceutical company, and patients who provided input into the trial design, which should lead to improvements in trial delivery and recruitment. The positive impact of this approach was demonstrated as the regulatory authorities approved the trial with no major issues or questions. Additionally, the inclusion criterion for high risk of exacerbation, which includes patients with frequent productive cough, will expand the recruitment pool and allow more patients to participate. The use of these inclusion criteria is supported by studies that showed that patients who met them experienced worse respiratory symptoms and were at increased risk of exacerbations and might benefit from more directed therapy. 38 39 1 The CRESCENDO study will use the novel primary endpoint of time to CompEx event, which is a surrogate, composite endpoint that captures clinically relevant deteriorations and exacerbations in patients with COPD. 31 31 The CRESCENDO study includes biomarker analyses, which may help identify a responder subset within the trial enabling targeted treatment. This includes analyses of MPO concentration and activity from blood and spontaneous sputum samples to identify patients with high MPO burden, and to assess target engagement by mitiperstat. 40 In addition to reducing patient burden and improving recruitment, the partly decentralized nature of the trial should reduce the environmental impact of the study, with less patient travel required. Due to the ease of oral therapy use, there is the potential for improved adherence, which might contribute to fewer exacerbations, further reducing the need to travel for treatment. Additionally, investigator meetings will be held virtually, which should reduce the environmental impact. Overall, these factors are estimated to reduce the carbon footprint of the study by ~30%. 10 The study has limitations. It was conceived following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at which stage there was uncertainty about the ability to report background exacerbation rates. To allow for this, a variable length and event-driven design was adopted, which provided up to an additional 12 weeks to observe a first CompEx event, ensuring that enough events would occur for the final analysis. The validation of virtual spirometry also occurred post-COVID-19. Quality standards for the spirometry assessment changed prior to COVID-19, and many investigators were unfamiliar with the new method of collection and the new quality standards. Additionally, the study has a lack of study sites in Asia, and there may be under-representation of Asian people in this study. Conclusions Inhibition of MPO may be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with COPD. The novel, patient-centric design of the CRESCENDO study, which is evaluating the MPO inhibitor mitiperstat, may have implications for the design of future clinical trials. It is likely that inclusion of the patient voice early will become a more standard approach, and trial decentralization should enable better recruitment of a more diverse trial population who is representative of the real-world condition.
