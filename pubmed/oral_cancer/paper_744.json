This study evaluated concentrations of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) in cattle muscle tissue from three municipalities: Oriximiná, Itaituba, and Monte Alegre. Metal concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of toxic metals via beef consumption (71 g/person/day) was below oral reference doses values (RfDo). Target hazard quotient (THQ) and total THQ (TTHQ) values for all metals were below 1, indicating no significant non-carcinogenic health risk. Monte Alegre exhibited the highest THQ for As and Pb, Oriximiná for Cd, and Itaituba for Hg. Although the overall assessment suggests low risk, elevated Hg concentrations were detected in 10% of the samples, with at least one animal from each municipality exceeding the European Union maximum residue limit (0.01 mg/kg). These findings indicate localized contamination and potential mercury bioaccumulation. Given the rising anthropogenic activities (such as mining and deforestation), continued monitoring of heavy metal levels in animal tissues is recommended to ensure long-term food safety and public health. toxic metals mercury bovine environmental pollution target hazard quotient Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES 88881.068161/2014-01 Fundação Amazônia de Amparo a Estudos e Pesquisas, FAPESPA 094/2023 Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq 201095/2024-6 201094/2024-0 This research was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES (grant n. 88881.068161/2014-01) and Fundação Amazônia de Amparo a Estudos e Pesquisas, FAPESPA (grant n. 094/2023).

Introduction The Amazon region is a recognized hotspot for mercury (Hg) contamination, with extensive research focused on bioaccumulation in fish and health risks to local populations [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 While mercury is a major concern, other toxic elements such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) [ 4 8 9 3 10 The contamination by Pb in the Brazilian Amazon, especially in the state of Pará, was studied in soil [ 11 12 13 3 14 15 16 17 16 18 Anthropogenic sources of Cd emissions, such as industrial activities and fossil fuel combustion, often exceed natural sources like volcanic activity and soil erosion [ 19 20 20 21 22 Although Hg contamination in fish is largely reported in Amazon region, few studies have investigated heavy metal accumulation in cattle. To our knowledge, no human health risk assessments have evaluated toxic metal contamination in cattle, despite of frequent heavy metals reports in the Amazon environment and their potential effects on human health, and beef being the most consumed meat in Brazil [ 22 Cattle ranching in the western Pará (mainly in the lower Amazon mesoregion) may be prone to heavy metal contamination due to a combination of factors. Pastures with natural forage species in wetland areas are annually flooded in the rainy season [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 3 8 33 34 35 36 The combination of flooding phenomena and socio-economic activities in the region intensifies the risks of environmental contamination and the related risk to the health of ecosystems and local communities. Despite this, the estimation of the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk of metal contamination from meat consumption has not been studied in the Amazon region. Thus, we aimed to determine the presence of toxic metals in bovine muscle in different cities in the western region of Pará subject to different types of metal contamination and to perform a risk analysis to human health of the consumption of beef from animals slaughtered in the region. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Site and Sample Collection Samples were taken from three municipalities located in western Pará, in the lower Amazon ( Figure 1 2.2. Sample Preparation Once in the laboratory, each specimen was measured and weighed. Subsamples of approximately 1 g were accurately weighed and digested in a mixture of 5 mL of concentrated nitric acid (TMA, Hiperpure, PanReac, Castellar del Vallès, Spain) and 3 mL of 30% w v 37 2.3. Toxic Element Analysis The concentrations of the non-essential elements arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) in the digested samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Agilent 7900 × ICP-MS system; Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). A detailed description of the analytical conditions is provided elsewhere [ 9 38 3 39 2.4. Human Health Risk Assessment To assess the risk to human health associated with the consumption of beef contaminated with toxic metals various methods were employed, including the estimated daily intake (EDI), the hazard quotient (HQ), target hazard quotients (THQ), and the total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) [ 38 40 41 42 43 To determine the risk of heavy metals from beef consumption, the calculations were based on: an average adult body weight of 70 kg [ 44 45 2.4.1. Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) To calculate the EDI, the average metal content from each city was multiplied by the specific consumption rate [ 40 42 43 46 (1) E D I = C × C c o n s B w cons 2.4.2. Non-Carcinogenic Risk The hazard quotients calculate the ratio between the exposure dose and the reference dose (RfD), representing the risk of non-cancerous effects. An HQ < 1 indicate that the exposure level is below the reference dose, thus the daily exposure at this level is unlikely to have negative effects during a person’s lifetime, and therefore the hazard can be considered negligible. Conversely, an HQ > 1.0 suggests potential health risks, as exposure exceeds the reference concentration, and consumption of beef may constitute a health hazard for the consumer [ 47 48 49 42 Determination of Hazard Quotient (HQ) The HQ relates the exposure dose a to a toxicological end point: the reference dose RfD [ 49 (2) H Q = E D I R f D o Determination of Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) The model for estimating THQ was determined by the following equation [ 42 45 (3) T H Q = E F r × E D t o t × F I R × C R f D o × B w × A T n × 10 − 3  tot −3 49 Determination of Total Target Hazard Quotient (TTHQ) In this study, the total THQ was expressed as the arithmetic sum of the individual THQ values for each of the metals analyzed (As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) [ 40 42 43 TTHQ = THQ (As) + THQ (Cd) + THQ (Hg) + THQ (Pb) (4) 2.4.3. Carninogenic Risk Cancer Risk (CR) for Arsenic e Cadmium The concentrations of potential carcinogens (As and Cd) in the bovine muscle tissue were used to estimate the risk of cancer development The ingestion dose exhibits a directly proportional relationship with the quantity of carcinogen ingested, with its effects being quantified through carcinogenic risk (CR) assessment. The CR was calculated for each metal using the following equation: (5) C R = C S F o  ×  E D I 50 51 52 −4 −4 53 Total Cancer Risk (TCR) For the assessment of combined exposure to As and Cd, the TCR was defined as the arithmetic sum of the individual CR values for each analyzed metal, using Equation (6) (6) M C R = ∑ i = 1 n C R 2.5. Statistical Analysis Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using Canoco software (version 4.5). 3. Results 3.1. Concentration of Toxic Metals in the Muscle of Cattle The concentrations of toxic metals in cattle muscle from the municipalities of Western Pará are presented in Table 1 3.2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the Distribution of Toxic Metals The PCA was used to study the relationships between the variables. The results of the loads of the different bioaccumulations of the four metals in the muscle samples of cattle are presented in the reduced space of the two main components ( Figure 2 Table 2 3.3. Human Health Risk Assessment In this study, the results of the calculation of the EDI ( Table 3 The results of the HQ ( Table 4 The results of the analysis of the target risk quotient (THQ) and the data of exposure to multiple contaminants (TTHQ) are presented in Table 5 Table 6 All individual CR and TCR values ( Table 6 −4 4. Discussion The mean concentrations of heavy metals in cattle muscle were below the maximum limits established by the European Union (MRL EU) [ 54 55 3 8 In order to better understand spatial pattens and environmental drivers underlying metal accumulation in cattle, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted, which explained 70.02% of the total variance in heavy metal (As, Cd, Pb and Hg) bioaccumulation across the sampled animals. This multivariate approach revealed two principal components with significant environmental relevance and allowed the samples to be spatially differentiated based on their origin [ 56 57 57 58 Naturally occurring heavy metals typically appear as trace components in detrital minerals, whereas anthropogenic metals, derived from activities such as mining, deforestation, agriculture, and burning, are transported through water systems as suspended particulate matter, dissolved ions, or colloids [ 59 60 61 62 63 64 These findings highlight the central role of Amazonian fluvial systems, particularly the Amazon and Tapajós rivers, not only as natural carriers of trace elements but also as modulators of environmental contaminant exposure in livestock production areas. The identification of distinct bioaccumulation patterns among the studied municipalities (see Figure 2 In Iran [ 65 66 67 68 The EDI of bovine muscle for the elements As, Cd, Hg and Pb, revealed values below the established limits (RfDo). Beef is among the three most consumed proteins in the Amazon region, alongside fish and chicken. Although there is limited data of risk assessment for cattle, studies on the risk of fish consumption have been carried out in various aquatic environments known to be subjected to activities that emit potential toxic metals, such as in the Aegean Sea [ 69 70 71 The results obtained from the determination of the Hazard Quotient showed values lower than 1 (HQ < 1), suggesting that poisoning or adverse effects resulting from the ingestion of each metal in beef are unlikely. The Target Hazard Quotient revealed no exposure (THQ < 1) to harmful effects resulting from the ingestion of these elements. The Total Target Hazard Quotient indicated no combined risk of all toxic metals, with the absence of potential adverse effects. THQ and TTHQ data have been instrumental in verifying populations exposed to toxic metals from food [ 54 55 These estimates have already revealed health risks due to fish [ 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 The carcinogenic health risk values associated with the consumption of bovine muscle (see Table 6 −4 49 This study is the first to assess the risks associated with ingestion of toxic metals through cattle meat consumption in the Amazon region. Our findings suggest that cattle may serve as bioindicators of environmental exposure to potentially toxic elements, which could pose health risks to Amazonian populations. Future research focusing on discarded female cattle, typically exposed to pasture environments for over eight years, may further clarify the species’ potential as indicators of long-term environmental contamination. In addition, paired environmental samples (soil, water, forage) from cattle´s farm and seasonal sampling would provide information that may elucidate the traceability of contamination pathways. Although the overall assessment indicates no significant non-carcinogenic health risk from As, Cd, Hg, and Pb in cattle meat from Monte Alegre, Itaituba, and Oriximiná, the detection of elevated Hg levels in 10% of the samples warrants concern. Notably, each city had at least one animal with muscle Hg concentrations exceeding the EU maximum residue limit (0.01 mg/kg wet weight). These findings suggest localized contamination and highlight the potential for bioaccumulation of mercury. Given the increasing anthropogenic activities in the region, such as mining and deforestation, ongoing surveillance of heavy metal levels in animal tissues is critical to ensure food safety and public health [ 80 81 5. Conclusions Cattle meat from Monte Alegre, Itaituba, and Oriximiná poses no significant carcinogenic health risk from As or Cd, nor non-carcinogenic health risk from As, Cd, Hg, and Pb, either individually or combined (TTHQ < 1). Nonetheless, the detection of Hg concentrations above the EU MRL in 10% of the samples across all three cities suggest localized contamination. These results underscore the need for ongoing monitoring of heavy metal residues in animal tissues, particularly given the rising anthropogenic pollution in the western Pará.
