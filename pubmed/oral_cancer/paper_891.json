Introduction Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious complication that can lead to revision arthroplasty and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden [ 1 Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis 2 3 4 5 Streptococcus Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus dysgalactiae viridans Streptococcus pneumoniae 6 The Streptococcus bovis S. bovis 7 S. bovis S. bovis 8 9 S. bovis 10 The proposed mechanism involves bacterial translocation through compromised intestinal mucosa, followed by hematogenous spread and seeding of prosthetic material [ 11 S. bovis S. bovis 12 While the association between S. bovis 2. Case Report This case involves a 68-year-old caucasian female who presented to our outpatient clinic with an active fistula located in the distal third of the postoperative scar on the posterolateral aspect of the thigh, accompanied by classical Celsian signs (erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness) ( Figure 1 At the time of presentation, the patient was in good general condition, afebrile, and had a normal range of motion in the affected limb. Past medical history included dyslipidemia, grade I primary hypertension, and class I obesity. Symptoms began approximately five months prior to presentation, when the patient noted the development of a fistula with purulent discharge at the site of the previous surgical incision. Two months after symptom onset, she sought medical care at another orthopedic department, where she underwent local debridement, wound irrigation, and dressing changes. She was prescribed oral antibiotic therapy with Augmentin 1 g every 12 h for one month. Despite this treatment, the symptoms persisted. Two months later, the patient consulted a different physician, who obtained a wound secretion sample for microbiological analysis. Culture results were positive for S. bovis One month later, due to lack of clinical improvement, the patient presented to our clinic, where we decided to admit her for further investigation and appropriate surgical management. Upon admission, standard radiographs were obtained ( Figure 2 Laboratory results revealed a mild anemia, with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.6 g/dL (normal range: 12.0–16.0 g/dL), and signs of systemic inflammation, including an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 58 mm/h (normal range: 0–30 mm/h), a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 2.3 mg/dL (reference limit: <0.3 mg/dL), and an increased fibrinogen level of 496 mg/dL (normal range: 180–350 mg/dL). The urine culture was negative. Based on the cumulative clinical, microbiological, and imaging findings, a diagnosis of PJI caused by S. bovis During the first-stage surgery, the infected prosthesis was explanted, followed by extensive surgical debridement and fistulectomy. A preformed, antibiotic-loaded spacer—Vancogenx ® Figure 3 The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient remained afebrile, with favorable local and general evolution. The results from the intraoperative samples confirmed the findings of previous tests, identifying S. bovis Given the identified pathogen and its known association with bacterial translocation and PJI, as supported by the literature, the patient was transferred to a specialized infectious disease hospital. The goal was to complete intravenous antibiotic therapy and to perform further investigations aimed at identifying potential colorectal pathology. A contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal-pelvic CT scan revealed a tumor-like mass measuring approximately 23 × 48 mm in the sigmoid colon ( Figure 4 Subsequent colonoscopy confirmed a friable, semi-circumferential, ulcerated soft tissue lesion approximately 5 cm in size, located 35 cm from the anal verge ( Figure 5 Histopathological examination of the resected specimen identified a tubular adenocarcinoma in situ (Haggitt level 0) arising within a tubulovillous adenoma exhibiting high-grade dysplasia. The tumor was staged as pTisN0MxL0V0R0, indicating carcinoma in situ with no regional lymph node involvement, indeterminate distant metastasis, and absence of lymphatic or vascular invasion or residual tumor. The gastroenterologist referred the patient to the general surgery department for curative management. A segmental sigmoid resection of approximately 15 cm, including adjacent adipose tissue, was performed, with restoration of bowel continuity. Based on the histopathological findings, no additional oncological treatment was indicated, and the malignancy was considered fully resected. The postoperative evolution was favorable. Six months later, the patient returned to our department for the second stage of the surgical protocol. At the time of admission, inflammatory markers were within normal or near-normal limits: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 29 mm/h (normal range: 0–30 mm/h), C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.5 mg/dL (reference limit: <0.3 mg/dL), and fibrinogen level was 422 mg/dL (normal range: 180–350 mg/dL). The surgical procedure involved removal of the antibiotic-loaded spacer and performance of a hip revision arthroplasty using a Zimmer Wagner SL ® ® Figure 6 Postoperatively, the patient received intravenous antibiotic therapy consisting of vancomycin 1 g every 12 h and ceftriaxone 2 g daily for five days. All intraoperative cultures remained negative for bacterial growth during the 14-day observation period. The patient was discharged in good general condition—afebrile, with favorable local wound healing and a descending trend in inflammatory markers. Upon discharge, she was prescribed oral antibiotic therapy with rifampicin 600 mg per day and cefuroxime 500 mg every 12 h, for a duration of 10 days. She was advised to use a walker for six weeks with gradual progression to full weight-bearing. At the most recent follow-up visit, three months postoperatively, both radiological and clinical evaluations demonstrated favorable outcomes, with no signs of reinfection or mechanical complications. 3. Discussion This case clearly supports the association between colorectal pathology and S. bovis 13 14 15 S. bovis This finding is consistent with previous studies that draw attention to the importance of colonoscopic screening in patients presenting with S. bovis 10 16 17 18 19 20 Even though Staphylococcus Streptococcus Staphylococcus aureus 21 22 S. bovis Streptococcus gallolyticus 7 23 S. bovis S. bovis 18 24 25 19 20 26 Bacteremia caused by S. bovis S. bovis 16 S. bovis 10 S. bovis In our case, the two-stage hip revision approach was selected due to the well-established association between S. bovis 27 28 29 A key particularity of this case lies in the delayed surgical intervention and initial therapeutic approach. The patient was managed conservatively with antibiotic therapy alone, without a full diagnostic workup to determine the underlying cause of the fistula and infection. While this approach provided temporary infection control, it carried significant risk: progressive septic degradation of the prosthesis and most importantly, delayed recognition of a serious underlying condition. Ultimately, colorectal cancer was discovered only later, but still at the in situ stage, which allowed curative resection and subsequent hip revision surgery under favorable clinical circumstances. Given these aspects, the key point of discussion is how the infectious presentation and the malignant condition interacted within the diagnostic process, raising the question of a possible relationship between the two. There is no direct pathophysiological relationship between the hip fistula due to periprosthetic infection and the patient’s colorectal cancer. However, the coexistence of these two conditions is clinically significant. The chronic fistula, attributed to prosthetic infection, diverted attention away from a more complete diagnostic evaluation and thus masked the presence of the malignancy. This case highlights how complex infections can obscure coexisting pathologies, reinforcing the importance of thorough systemic evaluation in patients with atypical or persistent presentations. This case report has several limitations. First, the follow-up period is relatively short, limiting our ability to assess long-term outcomes such as late reinfection, implant survival, or functional recovery. Ongoing monitoring will be necessary to draw more definitive conclusions. Second, the case was managed in a monospecialty orthopedic hospital, which may have restricted the continuity and integration of multidisciplinary diagnostic information. As a result, relevant data, particularly those related to the patient’s colorectal evaluation, may have been fragmented or delayed during inter-hospital communication and referral. 4.
