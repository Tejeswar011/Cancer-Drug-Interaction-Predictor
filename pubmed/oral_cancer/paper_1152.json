The diagnosis of PMOP relies on clinical symptoms and radiology. However, most patients with PMOP do not exhibit obvious symptoms in the early stages of this disease. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology in the auxiliary screening of PMOP. PMOP rats were induced by ovariectomy (OVX) surgery, with a Sham group and an icariin (ICA) treatment group serving as controls. A monolayer film of Au nanoparticles (NPs) was prepared using the Marangoni effect in an oil/water/oil three-phase system, and was used to detect serum SERS signals in the Sham, OVX, and ICA treatment groups. Then, the spectral diagnostic model for PMOP screening was established utilizing partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. Histopathology confirmed the establishment of the PMOP rat model. The assignment of Raman peaks and the analysis of spectral differences revealed the biochemical changes associated with PMOP, including the upregulation of tyrosine levels and the downregulation of arginine, tryptophan, lipids, and collagen. When employing the PLS-SVM algorithm to simultaneously classify and discriminate three groups of samples, the diagnostic sensitivity for PMOP is 93.33%, the specificity is 96.67%, and the accuracy of three-class classification is 91.11%.

Introduction Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a systemic metabolic bone disease characterized by an imbalance between bone resorption and formation, caused by the decline in ovarian function and decreasing levels of estrogen in postmenopausal women [ 1 2 3 4 5 The clinical diagnosis of PMOP is based on thoracic and lumbar vertebral X-rays (e.g., computed tomography) and bone density testing (e.g., dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)) [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 Currently, Raman spectroscopy, as a non-destructive method that provides molecular fingerprint information, has been widely applied in fields such as biomedicine and biochemical analysis [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Fortunately, by adsorption of sample molecules to Au or Ag nano-structures, the Raman scattering signal can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance, and this phenomenon is known as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 In this study, we applied SERS technology combined with multivariate statistical methods for the auxiliary screening of PMOP. Firstly, we constructed the PMOP rat model using ovariectomy (OVX), with a Sham group and an icariin (ICA) treatment group serving as controls. Subsequently, we prepared a highly homogeneous Au NPs monolayer film, and high-quality SERS signals were obtained from serum samples in the Sham, OVX, and ICA groups, with the purpose of exploring the specific changes in biochemical components associated with PMOP. Then, partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to classify the SERS signal acquired from the three serum groups, in order to investigate the feasibility of SERS technology in the screening of PMOP. This study will contribute to the development of an auxiliary screening method for PMOP based on SERS technology. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Rat Model and Treatment All procedures were approved by the Bioethics Committee at Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Approval Number: 3W2023122). Ninety 3-month-old, specific pathogen-free (SPF) female Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 300 ± 20 g, were purchased from Slac Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) (Production License No. SCXK 2022-0004). The rats were housed in the Experimental Animals Center of the Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Feeding conditions were as follows: room temperature: 22–26 °C, relative humidity: 40–70%, and ad libitum access to food and water. In addition, ICA was purchased from Chengdu Must Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China) (Product ID: A0145). In total, 1 g ICA was added to 250 mL of 0.9% saline to prepare a 4 mg/mL suspension of ICA, which was stored at 4 °C for subsequent treatment. After 1 week of acclimatization, 90 rats were randomly divided into the Sham, OVX, and ICA groups (n = 30 in each group). The rats in both the OVX and ICA groups underwent OVX surgery [ 40 Supplementary Materials 2.2. Collection of Serum and Bone Tissue Samples After 12 weeks of treatment, the three groups of rats were fasted for 12 h. After achieving adequate anesthesia using isoflurane (2%), 2 mL of blood was collected from the abdominal aorta. After clotting for 30 min at room temperature, sera were centrifuged at 1000× g g Supplementary Materials 2.3. Preparation and Characterization of Au NPs Monolayer Film 2.3.1. Preparation of Au NPs Monolayer Film Based on the Marangoni Effect For serum SERS detection, Au NPs were used as the enhancement substrates for Raman scattering, and a highly homogeneous Au NPs monolayer film was prepared based on the Marangoni effect. Figure 1 Firstly, according to the method reported by Frens [ 41 4 42 43 44 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6 14 2 2 2 6 14 6 14 2 2 2 2 6 14 2 6 14 2.3.2. Characterization of Gold Nanosol and Au NPs Monolayer Film The gold nanosol was characterized by absorption spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The absorption spectra of gold nanosol were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer (Waltham, MA, USA). The size and distribution of Au NPs were determined using a laser particle size analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern, UK). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2100Plus, Japan Electronics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (GeminiSEM 300, ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany) were used, respectively, to characterize the morphology of Au NPs and the Au NPs monolayer film. To test the SERS enhancement effect of the Au NPs monolayer film, 10 μL of 4-Mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) solution (0.1 mM) was added dropwise to the silicon wafer loaded with Au NPs monolayer film and to a normal silicon wafer without Au NPs monolayer film. After drying at room temperature, the Raman signals of 4-MBA were detected under the same detection conditions. We further employed the Au NPs monolayer film to detect the SERS signals of 4-MBA solutions at various concentrations (10 −4 −5 −6 −7 −8 −9 −1 −1 −1 2.4. Serum SERS Measurements For serum SERS detection, 10 μL of serum sample was added dropwise to the Au NPs monolayer film and allowed to air dry at room temperature. The SERS spectra of serum samples were detected using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, Gloucester, UK) with a 785 nm excitation wavelength. Spectra were collected in backscattering geometry via a microscope with a Leica 50× objective. Additionally, the detection of the Raman signal was performed using a Peltier-cooled CCD camera. For each measurement, the spectral integration time was set to 10 s, and the spectral detection range was 400 cm −1 −1 −1 In this study, there were 30 serum samples in each of the Sham group, OVX group, and ICA group. For each serum sample, 10 spectra were randomly detected and acquired within the serum droplet area. Then, the average spectrum, calculated by averaging the 10 collected spectra, represented the SERS signal of that serum sample. Finally, 30 averaged spectra (one per sample) were obtained from each group for subsequent analysis. 2.5. SERS Data Processing and Analysis The raw signals contained background fluorescence and SERS signal. In order to extract the SERS signal, we employed the Vancouver Raman Algorithm to efficiently eliminate the background fluorescence [ 45 PLS and SVM analyses were conducted using the MATLAB software package (Version R2016b). Firstly, we applied PLS to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data and extract pertinent variables, which are referred to as PLS components (PCs). After that, the optimal number of PCs was determined by combining the mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) with the adjusted Wold’s R criterion [ 33 38 46 2.6. Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS software (Version 19.0.0, IBM, Reston, VA, USA). Initially, normality tests (Shapiro–Wilk test) and homogeneity of variance test (Levene’s test) were performed on the data. If the data met the assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variances, one-way ANOVA was used for multiple-group comparisons. Alternatively, if the data met the assumption of normal distribution but exhibited non-homogeneous variances, Welch’s ANOVA was employed. Furthermore, if the data did not meet the assumption of normal distribution, the Kruskal–Wallis test, a non-parametric test, was used for multiple-group comparisons. The results were presented using box plots, and a p 3. Results 3.1.

The results of SERS scanning are shown in Figure 3 −1 Figure 3 Figure 3 −1 −1 Supporting Information (Figure S3) 3.3.

PMOP Screening Based on PLS-SVM Statistical Analysis Given that the SERS spectra of different sample groups exhibited significant similarities, it was inadequate to distinguish them merely by directly observing the spectral lines. Consequently, we utilized the PLS-SVM algorithm to extract spectral information and classify the samples, thereby facilitating the screening of PMOP. The main goal of PLS in this study was to downscale the dimensionality of SERS spectra and obtain a series of PLS components (PCs). Figure 6 53 Figure 6 53 54 N=4 Figure 6 To classify the samples, an SVM analysis was performed using the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel. In order to construct the optimal classifier, two crucial parameters of the SVM, namely the Gaussian radial widths σ C 55 Figure 6 σ C Figure 6 Figure 6 We further performed multi-class classification, utilizing the PLS-SVM algorithm to classify serum SERS data from the Sham, OVX, and ICA groups. The classification results are shown in Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 Table 2 4. Discussion PMOP is a metabolic bone disease caused by estrogen deficiency and is characterized by a generalized decrease in bone density and microstructural degeneration of bone tissue. An imbalance between bone formation and resorption is a major contributor to PMOP development, and various factors such as sex hormones and inflammatory responses are also involved [ 56 57 We used a combination of the oil/water/oil three-phase system with the Marangoni effect to prepare the Au NPs monolayer film. In this three-phase system, the Marangoni force drove the transport and compression of Au NPs, which originated from the surface tension difference between the two oil/water interfaces. When the surface tension of the upper interface (C 6 14 2 2 2 2 Figure 1 44 In this study, SERS spectroscopy revealed a decrease in serum arginine levels in the OVX rat model, which rebounded following ICA intervention (as depicted in Figure 5 58 59 Conversely, the SERS peak at 635 cm −1 60 p 61 62 The level of serum tryptophan (detected at 1197 cm −1 63 64 65 Collagen is one of the main components of bone, and a decrease in its content may lead to the destruction of the bone microstructure, thereby affecting bone density and bone strength, and increasing the risk of fractures. The results of Masson staining of bone tissue sections ( Figure 2 Figure S1 in the Supplementary Materials p 66 −1 −1 3 2 −1 67 68 To validate the feasibility of using SERS for PMOP screening, diagnostic discrimination was performed on SERS signals using PLS-SVM analysis. PLS was first utilized to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional spectral data into several PCs, which retained information on sample characteristics. In the field of spectral data dimensionality reduction, PLS and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are two commonly used methods. PCA is an unsupervised statistical method that extracts the most important features by maximizing data variance during data dimensionality reduction. Conversely, PLS is a supervised modeling approach that aims to identify a set of components that can maximize the explained variance of the response variable while minimizing the variance of the predictor variables. Compared to PCA, PLS incorporates the influence of the response variable during the dimensionality reduction process. This allows PLS to better explain the direction of the predictor variables and accurately predict the dependent variable, providing an advantage over PCA in terms of model interpretability and predictive performance. However, using all principal components (PCs) generated by the PLS algorithm to construct a classification model may lead to over-fitting. Therefore, in this study, the MSEP curve was used to determine the optimal number of PCs [ 69 Figure 6 5. Conclusions In this study, we explored the feasibility of using the SERS assay as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for PMOP. We combined the oil/water/oil three-phase system with the Marangoni effect to prepare Au NPs monolayer films to obtain high-quality serum SERS spectra from the Sham, OVX, and ICA treatment groups of the rat model. The Au NPs monolayer films exhibited robust SERS enhancement as well as good uniformity and stability. SERS spectra effectively revealed subtle differences in serum biochemical compositions across various sample groups, demonstrating their potential for assessing PMOP-related expression characteristics. Through spectral difference analysis, biochemical alterations linked to PMOP were identified, such as the upregulation of tyrosine expression and the downregulation of arginine, tryptophan, some lipids, and collagen. By combining SERS spectra with PLS-SVM analysis, we achieved remarkable sensitivity, specificity, and an accuracy rate of 100% in screening OVX samples. This study confirmed the feasibility of using SERS technology combined with multivariate statistical analysis methods in the screening of PMOP. Next, we plan to utilize the SERS technique to analyze serum samples collected from normal subjects, subjects with reduced bone mass, and subjects with osteoporosis. We will further improve the SERS substrate by incorporating an internal standard and applying it to serum SERS detection and analysis. We will utilize Raman probe molecules with characteristic peaks located in the silent region (1800–2800 cm −1 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bios15090568/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.Y. and X.L.; methodology, Y.Y., J.H., Q.S., H.X. and S.W.; software, X.W., Y.Z., T.H. and Q.H.; validation, H.X. and S.W.; investigation, H.H. and E.H.; resources, Y.Y. and X.L.; data curation, Y.Y., J.H. and Q.S.; writing—original draft preparation, Y.Y., J.H., Q.S., H.X., S.W., X.W., Y.Z., T.H. and Q.H.; writing—review and editing, Y.Y., H.H., E.H. and X.L.; supervision, H.H. and X.L.; project administration, Y.Y.; Funding acquisition, Y.Y., E.H. and X.L.
