Background Prior basic science literature suggests chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use may be associated with impaired tendon health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between chronic NSAID use and risk of distal biceps tendon injury (BTI). Methods A retrospective study was conducted using the PearlDiver database. A sample of 500,000 chronic NSAID users were exact matched to controls for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, and tobacco use. Multivariable logistic regression with sex-specific and age-specific subanalyses was conducted for 1- and 2-year risk of distal BTI and 2-year surgical repair rates as defined by International Classification of Disease and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Results After exact matching, 499,240 chronic NSAID users were matched with 499,240 controls. Patients with chronic NSAID use had a significantly increased risk of distal BTI at both 1-year (odds ratio: 1.51; 95% confidence interval: 1.32-1.71) and 2-year (odds ratio: 1.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.27-1.53) follow-up compared to controls. When stratified by sex, males and females with chronic NSAID use were significantly more likely to experience distal BTI compared to controls at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Discussion Chronic NSAID use was associated with increased risk of distal BTI at 1- and 2-year follow-up, including in sex-specific analysis. These findings may inform risks and expectations for providers prescribing chronic NSAIDs and merit further investigation.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between chronic NSAID use and the odds of distal BTI and subsequent surgical repair rates. We hypothesized that chronic NSAID users had increased risk of distal BTI compared to a control group who did not use NSAIDs. Materials & methods Data source This study used the PearlDiver M165 database (PearlDiver Technologies, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), a commercially available administrative database containing the records of 165 million patients from 2010 to 2022. These data are collected from private insurance providers as well as government programs and pooled into a single deidentified and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant database, which classifies medical events using standardized coding systems. Thus, ethical approval from our institutional review board was deemed exempt. Study design A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the effect of chronic NSAID use on the odds of distal BTIs and subsequent biceps tendon repair. Chronic NSAID users were identified with the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes ICD-9-V5864 and ICD-10-D-Z791 for “long term (current) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories.” Per ICD coding guidelines, this code is assigned to patients who are undergoing long-term NSAID therapy for a chronic condition that necessitates extended treatment. These codes were not used for medications being administered over a short period of time or for acute illness or injury treatment. These codes did not specify which NSAID patients were taking; however, aspirin was excluded within this code. 12 26 , 35 2 , 9 , 23 , 24 , 42 43 44 , 49 39 39 4 , 37 , 39 , 46 Identification of distal biceps tendon injury and repairs The rates of index distal BTI 1 and 2 years after a diagnosis of chronic NSAID use were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. These codes included sprains, partial tears, and complete tears. Current Procedural Terminology codes for biceps tendon repair were used to identify the rate of surgical repair in the 2-year period after the initial injury, including both partial and complete tears. All ICD-9, ICD-10, and Current Procedural Terminology codes used to define distal BTIs and subsequent repairs can be found in Table I Table I ICD, ninth and tenth revisions, and CPT codes used for exclusion criteria.

A random subset of 500,000 chronic NSAID users and 5,000,000 potential control participants were included in the matching process. Exact matching was utilized to pair 499,240 chronic NSAID users with 499,240 control patients. The average age of both groups was 57.3 years (standard deviation: 11.1) and average CCI was 1.73 points (standard deviation: 1.83). Most patients were female, making up 62.3% of the study population. No statistically significant differences in age, gender, CCI, diabetes, or tobacco use were identified between groups.

When stratified by sex, male and female chronic NSAID users were significantly more likely to sustain a distal BTI relative to the control group during the 1-year and 2-year follow-up periods. When further stratified by age, male NSAID patients aged 46-55 and 56-65 had a significantly higher risk of distal BTI relative to the controls at 1-year and 2-year follow-up. All female age groups had a significantly higher risk of distal BTI at 1-year follow-up, and the 46-55, 56-65, and 66-75 year-old subgroups had a significantly higher risk at 2-year follow-up. The NSAID male and female cohorts aged 46-55 had the highest risk of distal BTI relative to the control groups at 1-year follow-up (males: OR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.17-1.98) (females: OR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.53-2.88). The NSAID cohorts aged 56-65 for both sexes had the highest risk of distal BTI relative to controls at 2-year follow-up (males: OR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.24-1.72) (females: OR:1.77; 95% CI: 1.48-2.11).

Further, chronic NSAID use was associated with an increased incidence of BTI in both males and females but a decreased incidence of distal biceps repair in males. In 2010, 29 million adults in the United States were considered regular NSAID users. 50 Though there is a paucity of literature on the association between chronic NSAID use and risk of tendinopathy development, some studies have reported on the association between NSAID use and outcomes after surgical repair of distal BTI. These studies focus on the use of NSAID chemoprophylaxis to limit heterotopic ossification only. Anakwenze et al published a case series of 34 distal BTI repairs that were prescribed indomethacin 75 mg daily for 6 weeks postoperatively. 5 5 13 13 The pathophysiology by which chronic NSAID use may contribute to tendinopathies remains unclear. Several animal studies reported an associated decrease threshold in load to failure with NSAID administration after tendon injury. 8 , 11 , 19 , 34 8 , 11 11 , 16 , 19 7 , 28 14 , 22 , 48 A strength of this study was the stratification and analysis of risk of distal BTI by sex and age cohorts. Increased risk of distal BTI was observed across both male and female patients and across different age cohorts. Surprisingly, although distal BTI is more common among male patients, chronic NSAID use was more often associated with a significantly higher risk of distal BTI among female age cohorts. Prior literature does not include sex-specific analyses that may offer a rationale for a sex-specific difference in the association between NSAID use and distal BTI risk. One possibility is that women are significantly more likely to experience chronic pain-related pathologies relative to men. 20 1 10 , 32 31 Chronic NSAID use was associated with decreased rates of surgical repair overall, particularly for male patients. These findings suggest chronic NSAID use may indicate lower baseline functional status or increased risk for complications, given an increased comorbidity profile. Another possibility is that chronic NSAID use may be associated with increased risk of injury but lower likelihood of complete rupture, allowing for nonoperative management. Moreover, prediagnosis chronic NSAID use by this population, which is part of the nonoperative management for distal BTI, likely addressed some of the pain and inflammation associated with this condition. The reasons for the lack of association between NSAID use and surgical repair rates for female patients remain unclear. Several comorbidities were identified to be significantly different between the NSAID use cohort and the control cohort. The NSAID use cohort had a higher incidence of AUD, COPD, osteoarthritis, depression, and osteoporosis. It is possible that the NSAID cohort had a higher likelihood of using alcohol to self-medicate for chronic inflammatory conditions. Similarly, depression was reported by 18.2% of a cohort of patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. 41 36 29 , 33 Limitations This study is not without limitations. As with all large administrative claims databases, coding and billing accuracy was an inherent limitation to the study methods. The lack of specificity in defining chronic NSAID use by ICD code is one such limitation. As a result, we were unable to account for variations in minimum duration, dosages, frequency, and NSAID class, all of which are potential moderating factors in the association between chronic NSAID use and distal BTI. To minimize potential confounding of NSAID duration, only patients with active records 1 year before and at least 2 years after the diagnosis of chronic NSAID use were included. Further, the code documentation stated it was unlikely that patients classified as chronic NSAID were prescribed NSAIDs for a short period of time or to treat an acute illness or injury. However, as NSAIDs are over-the-counter medications, including only those with a prescription for chronic NSAIDs may have led to an underreported cohort. These elements warrant consideration in future investigations, particularly in assessing sex-specific differences and associated risk of tendinopathy. In addition, severity of distal BTI could not be ascertained by codes alone, which may have affected the management of these patients and surgical repair rates. The codes chosen for inclusion were established in prior literature that characterized risk factors for distal BTI. 39 39 Conclusion Chronic NSAID use was associated with increased risk of distal BTI at 1- and 2-year follow-up, including in sex-specific analysis. These findings may inform risk considerations when prescribing NSAIDs over a prolonged period and merit further investigation. Disclaimers Funding: No funding was disclosed by the authors.
