Ethanol disrupts gut microbial communities, compromises intestinal barrier function, and contributes to hepatic, metabolic, and neurocognitive disorders. Methods: We conducted a systematic PubMed search and meta-analysis of 11 human and 19 animal studies evaluating ethanol-induced gut microbiota alterations. Studies were assessed for microbial diversity, taxonomic shifts, barrier integrity, and systemic effects. Effect sizes were calculated where possible, and interventional outcomes were examined. Results: Across species, ethanol exposure was consistently associated with reduced microbial diversity and depletion of beneficial commensals such as Faecalibacterium Lactobacillus Akkermansia Bifidobacterium Proteobacteria Enterococcus Veillonella Akkermansia Bifidobacterium ethanol gut microbiota dysbiosis alcohol use disorder gut–liver axis microbiota–brain interaction meta-analysis rodent models fecal microbiota transplantation short-chain fatty acids This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Alcohol consumption is deeply embedded in many cultures around the world. With more than 2.3 billion global consumers and approximately 75 million individuals suffering from alcohol use disorders (AUDs), ethanol (ethyl alcohol) poses a formidable burden on public health systems worldwide [ 1 Figure 1 Although the liver is classically recognized as the primary target organ in alcohol-related morbidity, emerging research has accentuated the crucial role of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly the gut microbiome, in the initiation and progression of alcohol-related diseases [ 2 1.1. Ethanol and Its Metabolic Impact on the GI Tract Following oral ingestion, ethanol is rapidly absorbed in the stomach and proximal small intestine via simple diffusion and distributed throughout the body, including the distal GI tract, where its concentration mirrors that in systemic circulation [ 3 Figure 2 4 Oxidative metabolism, mediated primarily by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), yields acetaldehyde—a highly reactive and toxic intermediate implicated in tissue injury and carcinogenesis [ 6 7 Figure 3 This localized metabolic activity is associated with the disruption of epithelial barrier function, or “leaky gut,” and has been shown to contribute to an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers [ 7 1.2. Alcohol-Induced Gut Barrier Dysfunction One of the most deleterious effects of chronic ethanol consumption is the compromise of the gut epithelial barrier. Both ethanol and its primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, have been implicated in the disruption of tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), thereby increasing intestinal permeability [ 8 9 This breach of the epithelial barrier facilitates the entry of microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) into systemic circulation, which, in turn, activates hepatic Kupffer cells via toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR4), driving proinflammatory cascades that culminate in hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and eventually alcoholic liver disease (ALD) [ 10 1.3. Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis in Alcohol-Related Disease The gut microbiota, a complex ecosystem of trillions of microorganisms, plays an indispensable role in host metabolism, immune modulation, and barrier integrity [ 11 12 Figure 4 Chronic alcohol intake has been shown to significantly alter the composition, diversity, and function of the gut microbiome, a phenomenon broadly described as dysbiosis [ 10 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Proteobacteria Clostridium Fusobacterium 14 15 Preclinical studies using ethanol-fed rodent models have revealed marked increases in bacterial overgrowth in the upper small intestine and significant alterations in the cecal microbiota, including elevated levels of Bacteroides Verrucomicrobia Firmicutes 16 17 18 1.4. The Gut–Liver–Brain Axis: A Triangular Pathophysiological Circuit Beyond its hepatic consequences, ethanol-induced dysbiosis and gut barrier dysfunction appear to play central roles in the systemic complications of alcohol use disorder [ 19 20 Figure 5 Evidence indicates that microbial-derived products crossing a compromised gut barrier not only exacerbate liver injury but also reach the central nervous system (CNS), where they may trigger neuroinflammation and contribute to cognitive impairments observed in AUD [ 22 23 1.5. Therapeutic Potential of Targeting the Gut Microbiota Given the intimate interplay between ethanol metabolism, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and systemic inflammation, restoring microbial homeostasis has emerged as a promising therapeutic avenue. Several studies have demonstrated that administration of probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy donors can ameliorate ethanol-induced gut dysbiosis and its sequelae. In murine models, treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus 24 These interventions hold promise not only for mitigating the progression of ALD but also for alleviating neurocognitive symptoms in patients with AUD [ 25 26 Thus, ethanol-induced disruptions in gut microbiota composition and function constitute a key mechanism linking alcohol consumption to systemic diseases, particularly liver injury and neurocognitive disorders. Through alterations in microbial taxa, metabolite profiles, and intestinal permeability, ethanol sets the stage for a cascade of inflammatory and fibrotic events with implications that extend far beyond the liver. This meta-analysis seeks to consolidate current evidence on the bidirectional relationship between ethanol intake and gut microbiota dysbiosis with the aim of elucidating mechanistic pathways and evaluating the therapeutic potential of microbiota-targeted interventions [ 27 Unlike prior reviews on ethanol-induced dysbiosis, our study integrates data from both human and animal studies to generate meta-aggregated effect sizes and highlight translational patterns. Additionally, we provide a direct comparative analysis between human and animal models and evaluate the impact of microbiota-targeted interventions, offering insights into mechanistic pathways and therapeutic potential that were not addressed in previous reviews. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Strategy for Searching the Literature A systematic search was conducted using the PubMed database to identify original research articles evaluating the effects of ethanol exposure on gut microbiota in both human and animal studies. The search included combinations of MeSH terms and free-text keywords such as “ethanol”, “alcohol”, “gut microbiota”, “intestinal microbiome”, “dysbiosis”, “humans”, “mice”, “rats”, and “rodent models” [ 28 29 The full selection process is detailed in the PRISMA flow diagram ( Figure 6 30 The search initially identified a total of 112 records, including 70 human studies and 42 animal studies. After the removal of duplicates (4 human, 1 animal), 107 records were screened by title. This was followed by abstract screening (humans: 54; animals: 30) and subsequent full-text review (humans: 33; animals: 25) to determine final eligibility. Based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 human studies and 19 animal studies were included in the final analysis. 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria were defined separately for human and animal studies: Human studies: eligible if they investigated individuals with chronic alcohol use or alcohol dependence, assessed gut microbiota composition using sequencing or molecular tools, and included a comparator group (e.g., healthy controls or non-drinkers). Animal studies: included if the animals were exposed to ethanol via drinking water, liquid diet, vapor exposure, or gavage and reported microbiota outcomes assessed via validated methods (e.g., 16S rRNA sequencing, qPCR). There were no geographical restrictions in study selection. Exclusion criteria applied to both domains: Lack of a control group, absence of microbiota outcome data; Non-ethanol-related interventions (e.g., antibiotics alone, prebiotics); Language other than English; Limited methodological rigor; Inaccessible full text. Specifically, 12 human titles and 14 animal titles were excluded during the title screening phase. Abstract-level exclusions included scope mismatches, inaccessible papers, language barriers, and insufficient study design. At the full-text level, 22 human and 6 animal studies were excluded primarily due to insufficient control, unclear ethanol effect attribution, or poor methodological quality. Ethanol was selected as the focus of this analysis because it represents the predominant form of alcohol consumed globally and is the principal agent responsible for alcohol-related disease. Moreover, ethanol-based rodent models are well characterized and have been extensively validated to reproduce key features of alcohol-induced dysbiosis. 2.3. Screening and Data Extraction All screening steps—titles, abstracts, and full texts—were performed independently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved by discussion. Data extracted included population characteristics (species, strain, age, sex), ethanol exposure parameters (dose, route, and duration), microbiota analysis method (e.g., sequencing platform, region targeted), and key outcomes (diversity metrics, taxonomic shifts, functional alterations). For human studies, additional variables, such as alcohol consumption history, diagnostic criteria, sample source (e.g., feces, mucosal biopsy), and reported comorbidities, were recorded. The number of included studies was limited by the challenge of identifying randomized controlled trials and high-quality observational studies with sufficient methodological rigor and heterogeneity to allow for meaningful synthesis. Many studies were excluded due to the absence of control groups, inadequate microbiota outcome data, or failure to meet minimum quality criteria. The final 11 human and 19 animal studies therefore represent the best available evidence suitable for robust comparative analysis. 2.4. Quality Assessment Animal studies were assessed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool [ 31 Human studies were evaluated using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale, focusing on study selection, comparability, and outcome assessment [ 32 2.5. Data Synthesis and Analysis Given the diversity in experimental designs and microbiota outcome reporting, both narrative synthesis and quantitative comparison were employed. Microbial diversity (alpha and beta), shifts in major phyla (e.g., Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria), and functional signatures (e.g., SCFA production, bile acid metabolism) were synthesized descriptively. Where applicable, summary measures such as mean differences and confidence intervals were calculated for comparative analysis between ethanol-exposed and control groups. Results from both human and animal studies were tabulated and analyzed separately to preserve biological relevance. No funding was utilized in the design, conduct, analysis, or preparation of this article. All research activities were carried out independently by the authors without financial support from public or private institutions. 3. Results Table 1 Table 2 Table 1 Table 2 3.1. Human Cohort Findings: Microbiota Diversity and Clinical Outcomes To assess the impact of ethanol exposure on gut microbiota in humans, we included 11 eligible studies that met all inclusion criteria. These studies spanned various designs, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and interventional protocols involving fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, abstinence programs, or pharmaceutical agents. 3.1.1. Population and Study Characteristics The selected studies involved a total of 702 participants aged between 18 to 65 years, with most subjects being male ( Table 3 Figure 7 3.1.2. Effect Sizes for Human Studies Table 4 Among the studies with sufficient data, Du et al. [ 33 d d 34 d 36 d 38 d 40 d d 43 d 35 37 39 41 42 In most cases, beneficial shifts, such as increased abundance of Lactobacillus Enterobacteriaceae Table 5 As such, the long-term persistence of these effects remains uncertain. Notably, Wang et al. [ 62 3.1.3. Microbiota Alterations Human studies reported a consistent pattern of dysbiosis following ethanol exposure ( Table 6 Decreases: Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium; Increases: Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Proteobacteria (especially Enterobacteriaceae) ( Figure 8 Changes in microbial diversity (α-diversity and β-diversity) were often correlated with clinical severity, systemic inflammation (↑ IL-6, TNF-α, LBP), and psychological symptoms (↑ craving, ↓ cognition). 3.2. Animal Model Findings The studies analyzed employed a diverse array of animal models, with mice being the predominant species (n = 13), particularly the C57BL/6J, BALB/c, and ICR strains. Rats were used in five studies, most commonly the Wistar and Sprague Dawley strains. One study uniquely utilized human fecal microbiota transferred into rats, bridging preclinical and translational paradigms. Ethanol administration routes varied, with the Lieber–DeCarli liquid diet being the most commonly employed method for chronic exposure. Other models included drinking water supplementation (gradually increasing or fixed concentrations), oral gavage, vapor exposure, intermittent binge-like exposure, and ethanol combined with a high-fat diet (HFD). The ethanol doses ranged from 5% to 56%, with exposure durations from 4 weeks to 12 weeks, or longer for chronic use. One study mimicked acute exposure using a binge protocol, while another included subacute vapor exposure to simulate inhalation effects ( Table 7 Figure 9 A consistent observation across experimental models was the reduction in beneficial commensal bacteria. Notably, Lactobacillus Akkermansia Allobaculum Butyricimonas Ruminococcaceae Conversely, ethanol exposure favored the overgrowth of potentially pathogenic or proinflammatory taxa. An increase in the phylum Proteobacteria Enterobacteriaceae 53 54 Helicobacter Fusobacterium, Escherichia coli Firmicutes Bacteroidetes 44 Only Wang et al. [ 47 Saccharomyces Kurtzmaniella Candida, In parallel, ethanol-induced dysbiosis was frequently associated with compromised intestinal barrier integrity. Elevated levels of biomarkers like intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP) and LPS were observed, suggesting increased gut permeability and endotoxin translocation into systemic circulation. This barrier dysfunction likely contributes to the systemic inflammation and hepatic damage documented in multiple studies, including those by Daaz-Ubilla [ 44 53 47 Table 8 Akkermansia 34 47 56 57 59 61 63 Bacteroides E. coli 34 42 43 48 62 64 Lachnospiraceae Prevotella Roseburia 3.2.1. Effect Sizes for Animal Model Studies Table 9 Several studies demonstrated very large effect sizes, particularly those measuring ethanol intake, liver injury markers, and behavioral outcomes. For instance, Díaz-Ubilla et al. [ 44 47 51 58 d d 46 45 62 55 48 61 3.2.2. Intervention Outcomes Several studies evaluated interventions aimed at reversing or mitigating alcohol-induced dysbiosis ( Figure 10 Probiotic therapy: Lactobacillus casei Lactobacillus E. coli 48 59 Studies incorporating ethanol withdrawal showed partial or complete recovery of microbiota profiles. For example, Xia et al. [ 51 52 FXR-deficient mice [ 53 4. Discussion This meta-analysis consolidates evidence from 11 human and 19 animal studies to highlight the consistent, ethanol-induced perturbations in gut microbiota composition, diversity, and function. Notably, both categories of studies demonstrated convergence on hallmark microbial changes, suggesting robust and translationally relevant biological patterns. Multiple human studies ( Table 1 Lactobacillus 33 38 36 48 55 Table 2 Lactobacillus 65 Lactobacillus Similarly, Akkermansia 34 59 66 Akkermansia Microbial diversity also emerged as a central theme. Decreased alpha-diversity was reported in severe AUD cohorts [ 37 41 47 60 67 A notable distinction between human and animal studies lies in the complexity of comorbid conditions. While animal models often isolate ethanol as the primary variable, human studies [ 36 38 Proteobacteria Enterobacteriaceae 68 Proteobacteria A notable divergence was noted in the abundance of Escherichia coli E. coli E. coli E. coli E. coli Interventional outcomes offer additional insights. In humans, FMT significantly improved microbial diversity and clinical endpoints [ 36 38 Lactobacillus casei Clostridium butyricum 48 49 69 Clostridium butyricum Another important factor contributing to variability in the findings is the heterogeneity in microbiota sequencing techniques and analysis pipelines across the included studies. While the majority of both human and animal studies utilized 16S rRNA gene sequencing, there was significant inconsistency in the specific hypervariable regions targeted (V3–V4, V4 alone, or V1–V3). Moreover, differences in DNA extraction methods, sequencing platforms, and downstream bioinformatics pipelines (OTU vs. ASV-based clustering, use of different reference databases) further complicate direct cross-study comparisons. A small number of studies employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing, offering higher resolution but introducing additional variability in functional and compositional analyses. While several studies in this review reported neurobehavioral alterations associated with dysbiosis, it is important to note that most of these findings remain correlative. Direct evidence linking specific microbial metabolites to neurobehavioral outcomes is still limited. A few preclinical studies have demonstrated potential causality; for instance, SCFA supplementation has been shown to restore GABAergic signaling and ameliorate anxiety-like behavior in germ-free or antibiotic-treated rodents. However, such mechanistic insights have not yet been conclusively validated in human cohorts. Observed behavioral outcomes associated with microbial alterations support the translational relevance of findings between preclinical and clinical studies. Rodents exposed to dysbiotic microbiota displayed depressive and anxiety-like behaviors [ 45 46 34 37 70 5. Limitations One important limitation of this meta-analysis lies in the heterogeneity of control groups across included studies. Control cohorts ranged from healthy individuals with no alcohol exposure to placebo-treated or standard-of-care populations, introducing variability in baseline microbiota composition and systemic parameters. While this diversity does not invalidate the findings, it represents a potential source of bias that must be acknowledged in the interpretation of results. In addition, significant heterogeneity was observed in other aspects of study design, including ethanol dosing regimens, intervention durations, and microbiota analysis techniques. Specifically, studies employed differing routes and concentrations of ethanol administration (e.g., oral gavage vs. voluntary intake), and microbiota characterization ranged from 16S rRNA gene sequencing (with different hypervariable regions) to shotgun metagenomics. 6. Conclusions This meta-analysis provides compelling evidence that ethanol exposure induces consistent and functionally significant alterations in the gut microbiota across both human and animal studies. Despite differences in methodology, host physiology, and experimental design, the findings converge on key microbial signatures: a depletion of beneficial commensals such as Faecalibacterium Akkermansia Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Proteobacteria Enterococcus Veillonella Escherichia-Shigella In humans, dysbiosis was associated with alcohol use disorder, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and neurocognitive symptoms such as increased craving and cognitive impairment. In animal models, microbial shifts were not only reproducible but also shown to mediate behavioral changes, including anxiety and depressive-like states. Interventional studies further reinforce the modifiability of the gut microbiome. Probiotic supplementation, fecal microbiota transplantation, and ethanol abstinence were shown to restore microbial diversity, rebalance key taxa, and improve clinical or behavioral outcomes. Collectively, these findings position the gut microbiota as a central mediator in alcohol-related pathophysiology, spanning hepatic, gastrointestinal, and neuropsychiatric domains. Future research should focus on precision microbiome interventions and integrative biomarker development to personalize treatment strategies for AUD and related disorders.
