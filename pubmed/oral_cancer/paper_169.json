In the past decades, biodegradable polymers have been widely used in pharmaceutical and medical engineering materials. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) copolymer, renowned for its exceptional biocompatibility, inherent non-toxicity, and superior encapsulation and film-forming capabilities, has been widely acknowledged as one of the foremost candidate materials among next-generation biodegradable polymers with remarkable application potential. PLGA nanoparticles exhibit demonstrated versatility in accommodating hydrophobic or hydrophilic substances, which can be either encapsulated within their core matrix or adsorbed onto the surface. This includes chemical drugs, nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins. Upon entering the systemic circulation, the size-tunable characteristics of PLGA nanoparticles synergize with surface ligand-receptor interactions to confer dual-targeting capabilities: passive targeting through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects, and active targeting via in vivo PLGA theranostics nanosystems application biocompatibility The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Translational Pharmacology 1 Introduction The efficacy of a drug is not only related to pharmacokinetics, but more importantly depends on its bioavailability at the intended site of action, which in turn is determined by the drug delivery method ( Agnihotri et al., 2004 Allen and Cullis, 2004 Alavi et al., 2024 Farokhzad and Langer, 2006 Shi et al., 2016 Li et al., 2021 Kamaly et al., 2012 Kamaly et al., 2016 Zheng et al., 2017 Yang et al., 2024a Dykman and Khlebtsov, 2016 Lee et al., 2016 Hong and Choi, 2017 Lee et al., 2017 Oberli et al., 2017 De Matteis et al., 2018 Lee and Cho, 2018 Koo et al., 2019 Beach et al., 2024 Danhier et al., 2012 Martins et al., 2017 Swider et al., 2018 Table 1 Mir et al., 2017 Danhier et al., 2010 Ratzinger et al., 2010 Acharya and Sahoo, 2011 Maeda et al., 2013 Sah et al., 2013 Nottelet et al., 2015 Peres et al., 2017 Hamdallah et al., 2024 Salmasi et al., 2024 Ye et al., 2024 TABLE 1 Comparative analysis of PLGA vs other nanocarriers in drug delivery.

To achieve successful localization at diseased cells, these therapeutic compounds must overcome multiple physiological barriers including inadequate solubility, suboptimal membrane permeability, and rapid metabolic degradation. Implementation of advanced drug delivery systems designed for targeted transport to pathological cellular sites can simultaneously enhance therapeutic safety profiles, improve clinical efficacy, and mitigate intrinsic pharmaceutical limitations such as systemic toxicity, compromised hydrophilicity, molecular instability, and insufficient tissue specificity. Medical nanotechnology innovations have significantly advanced the engineering of nanoscale therapeutic delivery platforms. The polymer PLGA, certified by the FDA for its biodegradability, has become a cornerstone material in fabricating these precision-targeted nanocarriers, enabling enhanced pharmacological agent localization and temporally regulated payload release. At present, PLGA nanoparticles carrying various hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs are being studied to solve various thorny diseases. In addition, many studies are exploring various synthesis techniques to improve the targeting ability of PLGA nanoparticles and enable them to be highly specific in transporting to target organs ( Matoba and Egashira, 2014 Allahyari and Mohit, 2015 Mir et al., 2017 Swider et al., 2018 Rezvantalab et al., 2018 Sun et al., 2014 Feng et al., 2015 via Ghaly et al., 2025 Long et al., 2025 Booysen et al., 2013 Ding and Zhu, 2018 Table 2 TABLE 2 Critical comparison of PLGA nanoparticle fabrication techniques.

It is estimated that 18 million people die each year, with cardiovascular diseases accounting for 32% of global deaths ( Lloyd-Jones et al., 2010 Tucka et al., 2011 Barkas et al., 2024 Hu Q. et al., 2022 Katsuki et al., 2022 Dash et al., 2023 Wu et al., 2024 Libby et al., 2002 Bäck et al., 2019 Soehnlein and Libby, 2021 Adhyaru and Jacobson, 2018 Chan et al., 2017 Cheng et al., 2018 Kim et al., 2018 Zhou et al., 2018 Katsuki et al., 2014 in vivo Yang et al., 2025 Esfandyari-Manesh et al., 2020 Blanco et al., 2015 Liu et al., 2017 Wei et al., 2017 Martinez et al., 2018 Boada et al., 2020 Park et al., 2020 in vivo Wang et al., 2021 Wang Y. et al., 2019 Maija et al., 2014 Ghalehbandi et al., 2023 Morita and Hoshiga, 2024 Voronkov et al., 2024 Formiga et al., 2010 in vitro Yokoyama et al., 2019 Nakano et al., 2016 Rashedi et al., 2024 Colasuonno et al., 2018 Figure 1 Hu L. et al., 2022 FIGURE 1 This study developed a thrombus-fibrin-targeting phase-change nanoparticle (NP) with a core composed of perfluorohexane (PFH) and the thrombolytic drug rtPA, surface-modified with CREKA peptide. The results demonstrated that under low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) triggering, the NP enabled precise release of rtPA and synergized with the mechanical disruption of thrombus structures through PFH’s “liquid-gas” phase transition effect ( Hu L. et al., 2022 Diagram illustrating the creation and application of microbubbles for medical imaging. It shows the emulsification process using PFH and rtPA to form microbubbles, which are further combined with CREKA and EDC/NHS. The microbubbles are used in ultrasound (US) imaging and interact with fibrin, platelets, and red blood cells (RBC) in a blood vessel. LIFU is depicted enhancing the process. 4 The application of PLGA in central nervous system drug delivery The demographic aging trend worldwide has precipitated a surge in neurodegenerative disorder prevalence ( Hou et al., 2019 Barbu et al., 2009 Chen and Liu, 2012 Meir et al., 2014 Saraiva et al., 2016 Khalid et al., 2010 Murphy et al., 2010 Fan et al., 2018 Yusuf et al., 2021 Na et al., 2017 Luk et al., 2012 Chu et al., 2023 Lababidi and Azzazy, 2025 Chen T. et al., 2019 Figure 2 You et al., 2018 Bali and Salve, 2020 Trapp and Nave, 2008 Baecher-Allan et al., 2018 Rittchen et al., 2015 Zoe et al., 2014 Gholamzad et al., 2020 Ferrante et al., 1985 David, 2002 Valenza et al., 2015 Cano et al., 2019 Cano et al., 2021 Pineda et al., 2024 Medina et al., 2020 Esteruelas et al., 2025 FIGURE 2 This study developed an RVG29-modified polymeric nanoparticle system for targeted delivery of deferoxamine (DFO) to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD). As shown in the panel (A-C) via You et al., 2018 Diagram illustrating a three-part process for delivering deferoxamine (DFO) using nanoparticles. Part A shows the creation of RNP-DFO using double emulsion and stirring with RVG29-Cys. Part B depicts receptor-mediated transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier, with RNP-DFO interacting with cell surface receptors on endothelial cells. Part C details receptor-mediated endocytosis in cells, with DFO being released to reduce free iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytoplasm. 5 The application of PLGA in digestive system diseases The main cause of gastric ulcer is excessive secretion of gastric acid, and anticholinergic drugs, antacids, histamine H2 receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors are the main treatment options. However, existing treatment modalities often face restricted implementation due to insufficient therapeutic outcomes coupled with undesirable pharmacological responses ( Almadi et al., 2024 Bhatnagar et al., 2024 Vrbata et al., 2014 Russo et al., 2018 Tracy et al., 2023 via Chuah et al., 2011 Chronopoulou et al., 2013 Abd El Hady et al., 2019 in vivo in vitro in vivo via Figure 3 Yunlong et al., 2023 in vitro Wang et al., 2022 Ashton and Beattie, 2024 Triantafillidis et al., 2024 Tahara et al., 2011 Hua et al., 2015 Cristelo et al., 2025 via Anwer et al., 2017 Escherichia coli Nazarian et al., 2014 FIGURE 3 This study developed macrophage membrane biomimetic nanoparticles (MU) by encapsulating a polyethylene glycol-polylactic-co-glycolic acid-ulinastatin (PEG-PLGA-ulinastatin) composite to achieve targeted delivery. Experiments confirmed that MU exhibits excellent stability and biocompatibility, enabling precise targeting of subcutaneous and pancreatic inflammatory lesions via Yunlong et al., 2023 Diagram illustrating the process of using macrophage membranes to create MU for targeting the pancreas in a mouse model of caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Components include ulinastatin, PEG-PLGA, and macrophage membranes. Insets show MU recruitment, inhibition of P65/NF-kB, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 release, and highlight injured acinar cells. 6 Application of PLGA in the treatment of infection The rise of antibiotic resistance is due to the abuse of antibiotics, which also promotes the development of multi drug resistant microorganisms. If there is no suitable new drug for treatment, the diseases involving drug-resistant bacteria infection will be difficult to control. The escalating global challenge of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the strategic development of precision-targeted anti-infective therapeutics with pathogen-specific activity profiles. Nanotechnology may be one of the best choices, because it can develop intelligent nanoparticles with required properties by using physical and chemical properties, enable site-selective transport of therapeutic payloads to pathologically defined loci with spatiotemporal precision, and reduce the incidence of drug resistance. Because of its good biocompatibility and biodegradability, PLGA has been used to load or package antibiotics, natural products or metal ions for antibacterial treatment ( Singh et al., 2018 Cresti et al., 2022 Costabile et al., 2024 Liu et al., 2024 Staphylococcus aureus Figure 4 Maghrebi et al., 2020 M. tuberculosis Chaudhary et al., 2025 Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cruz et al., 2017 Enterococcus faecalis S. aureus Abo-zeid et al., 2022 Dong et al., 2017 Liu et al., 2020 via Elhabal et al., 2023 Stewart and William Costerton, 2001 Cai et al., 2012 Arafa et al., 2019 Shariati et al., 2022 Landa et al., 2024 Takahashi and Moriguchi, 2024 in vivo Katebi et al., 2021 FIGURE 4 This study encapsulated rifampicin into hybrid microparticles (PLH) composed of PLGA-coated lipid nanoparticles to enhance its inhibitory efficacy against SCV. The spray-dried PLH microparticles loaded the drug within both polymer and lipid phases. Upon decomposition into nano-aggregates, PLH promoted uptake by RAW264.7 macrophages, significantly reduced intracellular bacterial survival, and exhibited no significant toxicity ( Maghrebi et al., 2020 Diagram illustrating the process of nanoparticle-based drug delivery. Panel 1 shows PLGA and lipid nanoparticles encapsulating rifampicin. Panel 2 illustrates the dispersion of these particles and their interaction with cells containing intracellular pathogens. Panel 3 describes phagocytosis uptake by the cells. Panel 4 shows the release of rifampicin inside infected cells. Panel 5 depicts eradication of pathogens, indicated by red crosses on infected cells. 7 Application of PLGA in tumor therapy Malignant neoplasms persist as a predominant contributor to global morbidity and mortality, representing an enduring challenge to population health management ( Boire et al., 2024 Holder et al., 2024 Santucci et al., 2024 Dong et al., 2024 Iureva et al., 2024 Sonam Dongsar et al., 2024 Maeda, 2012 Maeda et al., 2013 Golombek et al., 2018 via Chen Y. et al., 2019 Fusobacterium Niu et al., 2025 Danhier et al., 2010 Shen et al., 2012 via Ma et al., 2012 Figure 5 Li et al., 2023 Le et al., 2016 Silva et al., 2015 Heo et al., 2014 Patil et al., 2010 via Liang et al., 2016 FIGURE 5 In this study, it combined doxorubicin (DOX) and anti angiogenic drug combrestatin A4 (CA4) into PLGA based co delivery nano hybrid (PLGA/DC NPs) through an improved double emulsification technology, and then modified polydopamine (PDA) on the surface of PLGA/DC NPs by self-assembly method for photothermal therapy ( Li et al., 2023 Illustration depicting a cancer treatment process. Compounds DOX, CA4, and PLGA undergo two-step emulsion evaporation, forming a nanoparticle with PDA coating. The nanoparticle is injected intravenously into a mouse, targeting a tumor via vascular delivery. A laser induces photothermal therapy, releasing heat and DOX for chemotherapy. The process highlights anti-angiogenesis therapy. 8 Application of PLGA in theranostics Current clinical oncology practice maintains distinct temporal phases for pathological verification and therapeutic implementation. This sequential workflow requiring diagnostic confirmation prior to treatment initiation risks therapeutic window contraction, potentially compromising disease management chronology in neoplastic conditions ( Wang et al., 2012 Sridharan and Lim, 2023 Wei et al., 2023 Bauer et al., 2024 Speltri et al., 2024 Figure 6 Menon et al., 2013 Le Tran et al., 2023 Ren et al., 2024 in vivo Zhang et al., 2021 in vivo in vivo Li et al., 2020 Komedchikova et al., 2024 Wang Z. et al., 2019 in vitro in vivo via In vitro Xing et al., 2016 in situ Peng et al., 2020 Table 3 FIGURE 6 This study developed a gas-producing engineered bacterial synergistic system.

These limitations span manufacturing complexities, regulatory hurdles, and physicochemical stability concerns, each requiring dedicated attention and innovative solutions. (1) Manufacturing challenges and scalability issues: The transition from laboratory-scale production to industrial manufacturing of PLGA-based nanomedicines presents substantial challenges in maintaining product consistency and quality. Batch-to-batch variations and lack of product consistency during scale-up manufacturing remain major hurdles for market launch of polymeric nanocarrier products. Traditional manufacturing methods struggle to maintain the precise control over critical quality attributes such as particle size, polydispersity index, and drug encapsulation efficiency when moving from benchtop to industrial production. To address these challenges, innovative approaches such as inline sonication processes have been developed for industrial-scale production ( Operti et al., 2022 Foulkes et al., 2020 in vivo Kwon et al., 2024 Liao et al., 2024 Barbery et al., 2025 10 Conclusions and future prospects PLGA and its copolymer derivatives have been extensively engineered as versatile nanotherapeutic platforms, leveraging their intrinsic biocompatibility to achieve superior clinical translation potential. Preclinical studies across cellular and organismal models consistently demonstrate enhanced therapeutic indices of PLGA-based nanoarchitectures in diverse pathologies. These systems allow precision molecular engineering via The authors are grateful to all the reviewers of this article for their comments and suggestions.
