Primary osteoporosis (POP) is a systemic metabolic bone disorder marked by diminished bone density and deterioration of bone microstructure, presenting a considerable challenge to global public health due to its widespread occurrence and heightened fracture risk. Although conventional western pharmaceutical treatments are efficacious, they are often associated with adverse events. Conversely, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) exhibits distinct potential owing to its multi-targeted and multi-pathway regulatory benefits. This systematic review elucidates the molecular mechanisms of flavonoids, polyphenols, saponins, polysaccharides, coumarins, and alkaloids in the prevention and treatment of POP. The study elucidates the mechanisms of action by modulating critical signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin, RANKL/OPG pathways and so on, thereby facilitating osteoblast differentiation, suppressing osteoclast activity, and ameliorating oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota, ultimately restoring the balance of the bone microenvironment. This research aims to advance the development of innovative POP medications based on TCM principles and to provide scientific validation for individualized therapy. primary osteoporosis traditional Chinese medicine active constituents mechanism signaling pathways The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Bone Research 1 Introduction Primary osteoporosis (POP) is a systemic metabolic bone disorder characterized by diminished bone mass, deterioration of bone microarchitecture, and heightened bone fragility. It is predominantly observed in postmenopausal women and older males. Clinically designated as the “silent killer”, hip fracture resulting from osteoporosis (OP) frequently represent “the final fractures an individual endure in their lifetime”. Globally, one-third of women and one-fifth of men over the age of 50 will experience a fracture attributable to OP ( 1 2 3 Current pharmacological interventions primarily consist of bisphosphonates ( 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 12 13 14 15 Consequently, identifying safer and more efficacious treatments is pivotal to the management of POP. The active constituents of TCM modulate bone metabolism via multifaceted, multi-target pathways, and certain chemicals can be used in combination with other drugs to enhance their effectiveness or alleviate their adverse effects. Panax ginseng saponins, flavonoids, and polysaccharides have shown potential efficacy in synergistically enhancing bone mass in arthritic rats and were well tolerated ( 16  Figure 1 Figure 1 Active constituents of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of POP. Diagram illustrating the categorization of bioactive compounds influencing bone health labeled “POP.” Sections for flavonoids, saponins, coumarins, polysaccharides, alkaloids, and polyphenols, each with corresponding plant illustrations, are arranged in a circular format. 2 Pathogenesis of POP POP arises from the interplay of genetic, endocrine, microenvironmental, and gut microbiota variables, characterized by a complex pathophysiology involving multi-system and multi-pathway interactions (  Figure 2 Figure 2 Mechanism diagram of POP. Flowchart illustrating the pathophysiological mechanisms of primary osteoporosis. It highlights genetic factors, endocrine imbalances, oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut microbiota disorders affecting bone metabolism. Key processes include vitamin D metabolism, osteoclast and osteoblast abnormalities, estrogen effects, and immune responses. Connections show interactions between various elements, leading to osteoporosis through abnormal bone density, homeostasis, and metabolism. 2.1 Hereditary influences Genetic factors significantly contribute to the etiology of OP. Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene analyses have discovered several significant gene variants strongly linked to diminished bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. The genetic influence on OP differs by phenotype. Specifically, hereditary predisposition to osteoporotic fractures is around 25%, wrist fractures range from 25% to 54%, and hip fractures can reach up to 48% ( 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2.2 Endocrine regulatory dysregulation An imbalance in the endocrine system is a fundamental factor contributing to the start and progression of OP, predominantly characterized by estrogen insufficiency, abnormalities in parathyroid hormone (PTH), and disorders in vitamin D metabolism. Estrogen irregularities: Estrogen is integral to bone metabolism via its receptors (ERα and ERβ), sustaining metabolic equilibrium in bone, and is a fundamental pathway in POP ( 25 26 27 28 29 Elevated PTH: PTH is crucial for regulating calcium metabolism, and older individuals with OP frequently exhibit increased PTH levels. This may result from age-related renal impairment, which diminishes the production of 1,25(OH) 2 3 30 31 32 Disorders in vitamin D metabolism: Inadequate levels of active vitamin D can result in disturbances in calcium and phosphorus metabolism, hence impacting bone mineralization ( 33 34 35 36 2.3 Oxidative stress and inflammatory response Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are significant contributors to OP. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) disturbs the osteogenic-osteoclastic equilibrium, resulting in heightened osteoclast formation and suppressed osteoblast activity ( 37 38 23 39 In a chronic low-grade inflammatory condition, pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 are consistently elevated, promoting osteoclast development through the activation of the RANKL-RANK signaling pathway. Clinical studies indicate that systemic immune inflammation indices are markedly elevated in patients with OP, and when these indices surpass 613.03, the risk of OP significantly escalates ( 40 in vitro 41 42 2.4 Gut microbiota and bone immune dysfunction The gut microbiota modulates bone metabolism via the “gut-bone axis,” employing mechanisms that include immune modulation and metabolite-mediated signaling pathways ( 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 3 Mechanisms and applications of active constituents in the prevention and treatment of POP 3.1 Flavonoids 3.1.1 Icariin Icariin is the primary bioactive component of Epimedium brevicornu Maxim, a plant belonging to the Berberidaceae family (  Figure 3A 52 53 54 55 52 56 Figure 3 Chemical structural formula of several flavonoids: (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) Chemical structures of seven polyphenolic compounds labeled (A) through (G).

Compound A consists of multiple hexagonal rings with hydroxyl groups, while compound B also features hexagonal rings with hydroxyl groups and a more complex branching structure. 3.3.2 Notoginsenosides Notoginsenosides are the primary active constituents of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Notoginseng Radix (  Figure 5B 97 98 99 100 101 3.4 Polysaccharides 3.4.1 Lycium barbarum polysaccharide Lycium barbarum polysaccharide is the main active ingredient, exhibiting antioxidant, anti-ageing, immune-modulating, and anti-OP effects ( 102 103 104 105 106 3.4.2 Astragalus polysaccharide Astragalus polysaccharide is the primary macromolecular active component of the Astragali Radix, exhibiting various biological functions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and osteogenic effects ( 107 108 109 110 111 3.4.3 Achyranthes bidentata polysaccharide Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae, a TCM used to tonify the liver and kidneys and strengthen the tendons and bones, contains the active component achyranthes bidentata polysaccharide (ABP), which exhibits multi-target regulatory effects in the prevention and treatment of OP. Yang Hao et al. found that it can activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, promote the expression of genes and proteins such as β-catenin, Runx2, and Osterix, significantly improve bone metabolism in osteoporotic fracture rats, increase BMD, and alleviate bone tissue pathological damage ( 112 113 114 115 3.5 Coumarin derivatives 3.5.1 Osthole Osthole is a coumarin compound from Cnidii Fructus (  Figure 6A 116 117 118 119 in vitro in vivo ( 120 121 Figure 6 Chemical structural formula of several coumarins: (A) (B) Chemical structure diagrams labeled as A and B.

It has been elaborated on how these active constituents regulate key signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin, RANKL/OPG pathways while simultaneously intervening in osteoblast differentiation and osteoclast activity, thereby restoring bone metabolic balance. The study particularly emphasizes the unique advantages of TCM constituents in improving the bone microenvironment (such as regulating gut microbiota, inhibiting oxidative stress, and reducing inflammatory responses), as well as their safety profile compared to traditional therapy. By integrating extensive preclinical and clinical research evidence, this study aims to provide a scientific basis for the development of novel anti- OP drugs based on TCM theory and to offer theoretical guidance for the formulation of personalized treatment regimens. There are also certain limitations at present. (1) Currently, research endorsing the treatment of OP with active compounds from TCM predominantly emphasizes cellular and animal studies, with limited clinical trials in humans. Consequently, it is imperative to enhance the transition from basic to clinical research by employing organoid or 3D bone tissue models to forecast the impact of TCM on the human organism. Additionally, the alterations in biomarkers in patients post-TCM intervention can be examined through metabolomics and proteomics to elucidate its systemic regulatory effects. (2) The bioavailability and formulation optimization of these active substances remain to be addressed, the active constituents of TCM include diverse functions, and when integrated with nanomaterials, they can markedly enhance their bioavailability and bioactivity ( 136 137 138 in vitro in vivo According to current literature reports, research on TCM treatment for POP is still in the exploratory stage. It is anticipated that future studies will employ new methods and technologies to conduct in-depth investigations, uncover the complex network mechanisms of TCM, and strengthen the integration of basic experimental research with clinical studies, thereby providing a more robust scientific foundation for the clinical application of TCM and the development of new drugs. Future research could also integrate systems pharmacology and artificial intelligence technologies to explore the “component-target-pathway” network of active constituents in TCM, providing a theoretical foundation for the development of novel anti-OP drugs. The clinical application of active substances in TCM warrants further exploration in the future. In recent years, the integration of active constituents from TCM with exogenous carriers has demonstrated considerable benefits in the prevention and treatment of OP. For example, enteric capsules created by amalgamating epimedium glycosides with snail enzymes markedly enhanced intestinal hydrolysis and absorption efficiency in osteoporotic rats, resulting in a 50% improvement in the total oral bioavailability of epimedium glycosides ( 139 In conclusion, investigating the intricate mechanisms of TCM via multidisciplinary technology to enhance clinical efficacy will yield innovative concepts for the advancement of contemporary anti-OP TCM characterized by a “clear mechanism, well-defined ingredients, and stable efficacy”.
