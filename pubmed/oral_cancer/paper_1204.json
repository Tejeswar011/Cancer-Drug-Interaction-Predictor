Zinc therapy promotes enterocyte copper sequestration, potentially reducing systemic copper. Individual biological responses may vary. Methods: ZINCAiD was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial assessing zinc therapy in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (EudraCT No.: 2019-000604-15; registered on 26 March 2020). Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive elemental zinc (135 mg/day for 12 weeks, then 65 mg/day) or placebo. Ceruloplasmin was measured at predefined intervals for safety monitoring, blinded to the investigators. Post hoc, “Zinc Responders” were defined by ≥20% reduction in ceruloplasmin at week 12. The primary cognitive endpoint was the Cognitive Composite 2 scale (CC2); secondary endpoints included MMSE and CDR-Sob. Findings: Of the 48 participants randomized, 9 discontinued, primarily due to unrelated clinical deterioration; 39 had complete ceruloplasmin data. Two serious adverse events occurred in the Placebo group. Mild gastrointestinal symptoms occurred in eight participants, with only four leading to dropout. In the primary zinc vs. placebo analysis, no significant differences emerged in cognitive outcomes. A post hoc exploratory analysis stratified participants by pharmacodynamic response: 12 individuals with MCI due to AD (31%) met the criteria for “Zinc Responder,” defined by ≥20% reduction in serum ceruloplasmin at week 12. Only Zinc Responders maintained cognitive stability over 24 weeks, whereas the combined group of Zinc Non-Responders and placebo-treated participants showed a significant decline. For the composite cognitive score (CC2), the interaction between visit and response group was significant ( p p p p p clinical trial zinc therapy copper mild cognitive impairment Alzheimer’s disease Italian Ministry of Health Alzheimer’s Association Part the Cloud: Translational Research Funding for Alzheimer’s Disease (PTC) PTC-19-602325 EudraCT 2019-000604-15 This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Health, which funded this study (Ricerca Corrente; R.S., S.F., A.G.

Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, projected to affect over 150 million individuals worldwide by 2050. The development of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies—such as lecanemab and donanemab [ 1 1 2 3 4 ATP7B 4 5 Recently, ATP7B 6 Zinc therapy, a widely used treatment for WD, reduces systemic copper availability by inducing enterocyte metallothionein and blocking copper absorption. Its efficacy and safety are well established in copper-related disorders [ 7 8 9 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design and Oversight ZINCAiD was a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase II trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of zinc therapy in MCI due to AD. Patients with MCI due to AD were recruited between June 2020 and May 2023 at the University Hospital of Brescia (Italy) and the Memory Clinic of the IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli in Brescia (Italy). Eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of the trial’s arms, consisting of a treatment group receiving zinc therapy and a placebo group taking identical placebo tablets in a 2:1 ratio. 2.2. Ethics Approval The study protocol (PTC-19-602325; EudraCT No.: 2019-000604-15; registered on 26 March 2020) was approved by the local Regional Ethics Committees (approval codes: 25/2020, CE150186 2.3. Participants and Selection Criteria Eligible participants were aged 60 years or older, met internationally accepted criteria for MCI due to AD [ 10 11 12 8 13 Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of concomitant severe or unstable diseases and disabilities that may interfere with copper metabolism, and with primary and secondary outcome evaluation, or may bias the assessment of the clinical or mental status of the subject or put the subject at special risk; concomitant severe or unstable cardiovascular diseases; concomitant primary neurodegenerative disorder besides AD, or neurological or psychiatric disorders of any etiology; clinically significant anemia; known hypersensitivity to zinc sulphate tablets including any of the components of the formulation. 2.4. Randomization and Masking Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive zinc or placebo using a computer-generated permuted block randomization sequence, stratified by site. The random allocation sequence was prepared by an independent statistician who was not involved in participant enrolment or outcome assessment. Allocation was concealed using centralized communication with site pharmacies, and all investigators, participants, and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment assignment throughout the study. Unlike prior open-label studies in copper-related disorders, where dosing was titrated to achieve pharmacodynamic targets [ 7 8 2.5. Procedures Participants assigned to the zinc treatment arm received oral elemental zinc in tablet form (200 mg zinc sulfate tablets). During the first week, participants received 67.5 mg/day of elemental zinc (administered as one and a half 200 mg zinc sulfate tablets daily). From week 2 to week 12, the dose was increased to 135 mg/day (three 200 mg tablets daily, divided into three doses). Beginning at week 13 and continuing through week 24, the dose was reduced to 67.5 mg/day (one and a half 200 mg tablets daily), administered in two doses (45 mg in the morning and 22.5 mg in the evening). Participants in the placebo group followed an identical schedule with matching placebo capsules. Cognitive assessments were administered at baseline and 24-week visit using a standardized neuropsychological battery. Clinical safety and tolerability were evaluated at each scheduled visit—baseline visit, 3-week visit, 6-week visit, 12-week visit, and 24-week visit—through physical examination, vital signs, hematological and biochemical monitoring (including serum Cp), and adverse event reporting. Ceruloplasmin concentrations below 10 mg/dL were prespecified as a safety threshold, but no such cases were observed. In line with the double-blind design, zinc dosage was not modified based on individual laboratory results. 2.6. Assessments and Outcome Measures Cognitive functions were assessed using a standardized neuropsychological battery administered at baseline and 6 months. The battery includes, as a primary cognitive outcome, the Cognitive Composite 2 scale (CC2) [ 14 12 12 15 Serum Cp concentration was measured using a validated immunoturbidimetric assay (Futura System S.r.l., Rome, Italy) on the Pentra 400 automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Horiba ABX, Montpellier, France). Calibration and quality control procedures used pooled healthy reference sera (IMCON and INCOMLOW; Futura System S.r.l.), following manufacturer guidelines. 2.7. Statistical Methods 2.7.1. Sample Size Calculation To determine the necessary sample size, we based our estimation on CC2, a composite outcome combining both cognitive (ADAS-Cog) and functional (CDR-SOB) measures [ 14 14 9 2.7.2. Statistical Analysis Normality of continuous variables was assessed through both statistical tests and visual inspection of distribution plots. Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize baseline characteristics. Between-group comparisons of continuous variables were conducted using independent samples t 16 17 18 19 p p p p 19 p p 2.8.

To contextualize this limitation, we conducted a power calculation using G*Power based on the expected effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.69).

Safety and Study Discontinuation Of the participants enrolled, nine discontinued the study before study completion. The most common reason was patient withdrawal due to clinical deterioration judged unrelated to the study drug. Two serious adverse events (one ischemic stroke and one acute myocardial infarction), both occurring in the placebo group, also led to treatment discontinuation. No serious adverse events occurred in the zinc group. Other reasons for discontinuation included logistical limitations (e.g., inability to attend visits or undergo venous sampling) and personal choice. Mild adverse events were reported in eight participants, most commonly appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, epigastric burning, and abdominal discomfort. These events were transient, managed symptomatically, and did not require discontinuation of treatment. Notably, only four participants who experienced mild adverse events subsequently chose to withdraw from the study, indicating that these effects were not the primary reason for dropout in most cases. Moreover, regarding Analysis 2, nine patients had Cp missing data at baseline because the protocol did not require the assessment of Cp at baseline. 4. Discussion The randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial ZINCAiD provides preliminary, biologically anchored evidence that zinc therapy may stabilize cognitive function in a pharmacodynamically defined subset of MCI patients, specifically, those having a ≥20% reduction in serum ceruloplasmin [ 16 17 18 20 13 9 21 13 Zinc acts by inducing metallothioneins in enterocytes, thereby blocking intestinal copper absorption and gradually depleting systemic excess copper levels [ 22 23 24 The cognitive stabilization observed in those patients who reached a pharmacodynamic state of chemical copper deficiency supports the hypothesis that copper dysregulation may be a tractable contributor to disease progression in this subgroup—an insight deeply rooted in the clinical experience of Brewer and Hoogenraad, who treated hundreds of patients with copper metabolism disorders using zinc-based therapy [ 9 25 17 16 17 16 17 18 7 16 17 Our data suggest that pharmacodynamic copper depletion, as indicated by ≥20% reduction in ceruloplasmin, is a necessary condition for cognitive stabilization under zinc therapy. However, target engagement alone may not be sufficient in all cases to guarantee clinical benefit, as additional biological or clinical factors may influence the therapeutic response. These findings raise important questions regarding how best to monitor and interpret biological response in the context of a blinded, fixed-dose intervention. A key methodological limitation is the incompatibility between pharmacodynamic dose titration and double-blind design in our exploratory, non-commercial study. In open-label studies of anti-copper therapy, including those by Brewer and Hoogenraad [ 7 8 19 While our study was not powered to prospectively validate this biological stratification, the consistency between pharmacodynamic response and clinical trajectory provides a compelling rationale for future targeted trials. The increase in ceruloplasmin levels observed at the 12-week visit among Zinc Responders is consistent with the protocol-defined halving of zinc dosage after Week 12, from 135 mg/day to 65 mg/day. This pharmacodynamic rebound likely reflects the dose-dependent induction of intestinal metallothionein, which is critical for zinc-mediated copper sequestration [ 16 17 The correlation between the biochemical engagement and cognitive stabilization in Zinc Responders reinforces the hypothesis that modulating copper metabolism may influence trajectories in biologically selected MCI patients. This association was further supported by converging results across two validated clinical endpoints—CDR-SOB and CC2—allowing comparison between a widely adopted, semi-structured staging tool and a neuropsychological composite designed for sensitivity to early cognitive changes [ 14 26 1 27 26 14 1 27 1 9 27 14 The emerging concept of cuproptosis—a copper-driven, regulated cell death pathway—provides a mechanistic link between systemic copper dysregulation and neurodegeneration. Triggered by excess copper binding to lipoylated tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, it induces proteotoxic stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death [ 6 Our findings are consistent with previous trials suggesting zinc may attenuate cognitive decline in AD and MCI. Studies have reported cognitive stabilization—especially in older adults or individuals with altered copper metabolism [ 9 28 9 Zinc’s neuroprotective effects stem not only from correcting copper imbalance but also from direct actions on synaptic and cellular processes, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulation and oxidative stress reduction [ 29 30 31 The ZINCAiD protocol was designed under the scientific mentorship of George Brewer, a pioneer in copper biology and zinc therapy [ 7 9 16 17 21 24 9 21 32 32 25 5 While our study focused on zinc sulfate due to its favorable safety profile and clinical use in WD, alternative copper-lowering agents such as tetrathiomolybdate (TM) also warrant consideration. TM exerts dual action as a potent copper chelator and anti-angiogenic compound, and it has shown promise in oncology and neurodegeneration [ 17 33 34 35 36 37 The primary limitation of the ZINCAiD trial is the modest sample size, which—while sufficient to detect a medium-to-large treatment effect—may limit the generalizability of the findings and the ability to explore subgroup effects. Although the a priori power analysis supported the planned sample size, the final enrolled cohort was smaller than expected. As such, the possibility of a type II error—failing to detect a true effect due to insufficient power—cannot be excluded, particularly in the primary comparison. A post hoc estimate based on the expected effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.69) and observed group sizes yielded a power of approximately 70.5%. While this is moderately acceptable, the results should be interpreted with caution, and future studies with larger samples will be essential to confirm these findings and enable more granular subgroup analyses. Additional limitations include the fixed-dose design, which did not allow for personalized zinc titration to ensure that all participants reached the targeted ceruloplasmin reduction, and the binary classification of “responders” based on a post hoc threshold—even though this threshold was pharmacodynamically justified and grounded in prior anti-copper therapy research. Furthermore, we did not incorporate longitudinal imaging or CSF biomarkers beyond the screening phase. Nevertheless, the consistency of clinical stabilization across multiple independent cognitive outcomes, coupled with a biologically coherent pharmacodynamic signal, strengthens the internal validity of the observed effects. This work suggests that biologically stratified therapy targeting copper metabolism may offer a low-cost, mechanism-driven approach to slowing cognitive decline in MCI. Future trials should aim to replicate these findings in larger, multicenter cohorts, using early ceruloplasmin reduction as both a marker of target engagement and a potential enrichment strategy for identifying treatment responders. 5. Conclusions In this randomized, double-blind trial, oral zinc therapy stabilized cognition in a pharmacodynamically defined subgroup of MCI patients with systemic copper imbalance. These findings support the role of copper homeostasis as a therapeutic target in early AD and propose serum ceruloplasmin as a feasible pharmacodynamic marker. Despite the limited sample size, the alignment between biochemical and clinical outcomes warrants larger confirmatory trials within a precision medicine framework. The results also revive the hypothesis of trace metal dysregulation in AD and suggest that anti-copper strategies used in WD may be applicable in selected neurodegenerative cases.

The figure summarizes participant flow from initial screening through randomization, treatment allocation, follow-up, and final analysis. Notably, a high screen failure rate was observed due to stringent inclusion criteria, particularly the requirement of confirmed amyloid positivity. Participant retention during the 24-week double-blind phase was acceptable.
