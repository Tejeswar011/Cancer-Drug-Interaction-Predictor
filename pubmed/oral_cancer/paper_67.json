D-D, C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin (HGB), cholesterol concentration (CHOL), procalcitonin concentration (PCT), and fibrinogen concentration (FPC).), fibrinogen concentration (FIB), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and hypoproteinemia (TP concentration ≤ 60 g/L or ALB concentration ≤ 35 g/L). 2.2.2 Research methods The perioperative course and treatment of the patients were meticulously documented.

The logistic regression linear equation of the early warning model for perioperative DVT risk was as follows: Logit( p 3.3.2 Goodness-of-fit test of the early warning model In this study, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used to judge the fit of the model; the results showed χ 2 P 3.4.2 Differentiation test of early warning model In this study, after importing the clinical case data from the model group into the prediction model, the predictive probability value of each sample was calculated and this probability was used as a predictor variable. The occurrence status of DVT was defined as a dichotomous response variable. The ROC curves of the subjects were plotted, and the model's classification performance was quantitatively assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). The Yoden index maximization criterion was further used to determine the optimal cut-off value for the model prediction probability, which corresponded to a model prediction threshold of 0.076, an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.80–0.92), a sensitivity of 82.75%, and a specificity of 75.9%, which confirms that the model had a good predictive ability. The ROC curves of the model group are plotted in Figure 1 Figure 1 Early warning model ROC curve (modeling group). ROC curve showing the trade-off between sensitivity and 1-specificity. The curve is represented in orange with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75. A diagonal dashed line represents random chance. 3.5 Validation of early warning model DVT occurred in 11 of 83 patients in the validation group during the perioperative period, and the early warning results revealed a sensitivity of 72.73%, a specificity of 84.72%, and an accuracy of 83.13%.

The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.81. 4 Discussion The results of this study revealed that the incidence of perioperative lower extremity deep vein thrombosis in patients with spinal fractures was 17.46%, which is an approximate or slightly lower incidence than the epidemiological data reported in the literature (0.2%–31%) ( 9 10 In this study, a history of perioperative blood transfusion, high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer concentrations >500 μg/L, a history of hypertension, age ≥60 years, and prolonged bed rest were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses as independent risk factors for perioperative lower-extremity DVT in patients with spinal fractures. Previous studies have shown that perioperative blood transfusion during surgery is strongly associated with thrombosis ( 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20 As a specific marker of the fibrinolytic process, an increase in D-dimer concentration directly reflects the presence of hypercoagulability and the subsequent enhancement of fibrinolytic activity in vivo 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 5 Conclusions In this study, based on the results of a multivariate regression analysis model (OR values and their influence weights), an early warning model for early risk identification of perioperative DVT in patients undergoing spinal fracture surgery (incorporating a total of six independent risk factors) was further developed through data processing with logistic regression formulas. Using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, we validated the predictive efficacy of this predictive model in terms of the number of perioperative DVT cases, and the results showed consistency between its predictive values and the actual number of observed cases. A good fit ( χ 2 P p In this study, unifactorial and multifactorial logistic regression analyses were used to identify and quantify risk variables that contribute significantly and independently to the development of DVT as a clinical event in patients undergoing spinal fracture surgery during postoperative recovery. The model considers a variety of factors that may influence the development of DVT, including a history of blood transfusion, medical history, age, coagulation, and inflammatory markers. The study's results revealed that the constructed early warning model had a high AUC in both the model and validation groups, and the evaluation indices, such as sensitivity and specificity, were within the acceptable range. This study suggested that the model demonstrated excellent predictive performance and accurately quantified the likelihood of patients undergoing spinal fracture surgery to develop lower-limb DVT, thus providing strong support for decision-making in clinical practice. Notably, although this study achieved its intended goals and produced valuable findings, its results are subject to several limitations that need to be fully considered when interpreting the research results are interpreted. For example, the sample sizes included in the retrospective analyses tend to be more limited, which may limit the ability of the constructed models to be generalized, that is, the efficacy of the model's performance in the face of unseen data. Notably, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment protocols and patient composition across different healthcare organizations. This implies that the existing models' scope of application and generalizability must be more fully explored and confirmed through subsequent studies. In the future, we will continue to monitor the research progress in this area and continuously improve and update such risk warning models. Acknowledgments We thank all the participants in the study.
