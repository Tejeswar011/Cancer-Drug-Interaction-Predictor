Thirteen patients were retrospectively reviewed, with seven receiving LIO-guided TTT and six treated with plaque brachytherapy. Both treatments achieved tumor control and resolution of subretinal fluid; however, LIO-guided TTT demonstrated superior visual outcomes, with 71% of patients showing significant improvement compared to none in the plaque group. These findings suggest that LIO- guided TTT is a safe, accessible, and vision-preserving alternative to plaque therapy in regions lacking PDT.

Introduction Circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (CCH) is a rare benign vascular tumor that accounts for less than 1% of all choroidal tumors diagnosed clinically [ 1 2 3 1 3 1 3 4 4 5 CCH usually remains asymptomatic, typically presenting in adulthood with visual symptoms resulting from exudative retinal detachment, cystoid macular edema, or subretinal fluid accumulation [ 3 6 6 7 8 9 6 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 6 7 11 17 18 6 10 10 19 10 15 19 20 On the other hand, TTT is a less invasive alternative that induces hyperthermia within the tumor tissue. Studies have demonstrated visual improvement in 44% of eyes treated with TTT, tumor regression in 11–20%, and resolution of exudative retinal detachment in over 90% of cases [ 7 21 22 23 24 25 26 2. Methods This is a retrospective case series approved by the Institutional Review Board at King Hussein Cancer Center (25KHCC222). It involves 13 eyes of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with choroidal hemangioma between January 2016 and December 2024 at the King Hussein Cancer Center. Data was acquired from patients’ medical charts, fundus photos, and radiology reports. Diagnosis was based on characteristic clinical features supported by multimodal imaging, including ultrasonography, fundus photography, and Optical Coherent Tomography (OCT). Outcome measures included age at diagnosis, gender, survival, and laterality, visual acuity at presentation and at the last follow-up, tumor features, management, management outcome, and survival. Tumors were evaluated based on pre-treatment tumor thickness, presence of subretinal fluid, the tumor’s distance from the optic disc and fovea, post-treatment tumor thickness, change in tumor thickness, sub-retinal fluid reduction, and complications during the treatment and visual outcome. Patients treated with brachytherapy were assessed for additional parameters, including plaque size and radiation dose, and patients treated by laser indirect ophthalmoscopy-guided transpupillary thermotherapy (LIO-guided TTT) were assessed for TTT power and duration. None of the patients in either group received anti-VEGF therapy for the management of subretinal fluid. 2.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The eligibility criteria for inclusion were patients with a clinical diagnosis of small size (thickness less than or equal to 5 mm) circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (CCH) that were treated either with laser indirect ophthalmoscopy-guided transpupillary thermotherapy (LIO-guided TTT) or with I-125 radioactive plaque brachytherapy and were followed for at least 1 year after treatment. Exclusion criteria included eyes with diffuse choroidal hemangiomas, eyes with Sturge–Weber Syndrome, choroidal hemangiomas with thickness more than 5 mm, eyes treated with modalities other than LIO-guided TTT or plaque brachytherapy, cases with incomplete follow-up data, and cases in which observation was chosen as the management plan. 2.2. Statistical Analysis We used descriptive statistics for categorical (frequencies; percentages) and continuous (mean; median) variables. Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the association between treatment modality (LIO-guided TTT vs. plaque brachytherapy) and clinical outcomes, including visual acuity improvement, tumor thickness reduction, and sub-retinal fluid resolution. A p 3. Results Twenty-one patients were diagnosed with choroid hemangioma, eight were excluded from this study (four were asymptomatic and did not receive any treatment, two had diffuse choroid hemangioma with Sturge–Weber disease, one had a large choroid melanoma with 6.5 mm thickness, and one lost follow-up without getting treatment). Our final analysis included 13 patients with symptomatic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. 3.1. Demographics and Tumor Features The median age at diagnosis was 42 years (range: 4–62 years). The tumor was in the right eye in five (38%) patients and in the left eye in eight (62%) patients and no one had bilateral choroidal hemangioma. Ten (77%) were males and three (23%) were females, yielding a male-to-female ratio of 3.3:1. From these 13 patients, 6 (46%) were treated with plaque brachytherapy and seven (54%) underwent trans-pupillary thermotherapy (TTT) guided by laser indirect ophthalmoscopy (LIO) ( Table 1 At diagnosis, visual acuity ranged from light perception to 0.5 decimal. Overall, 69% of patients had tumors located in the macular region, while 31% had extra-macular tumors. In the LIO-guided TTT group, the mean tumor thickness was 3.8 mm, while in the radioactive plaque brachytherapy group it was 4.7 mm. The median tumor thickness in the I-125 plaque brachytherapy group was 4.5 mm (range, 4.5–5.0 mm), whereas in the LIO-guided TTT group it was 3.8 mm (range, 2.9–5.0 mm). The median tumor distance from the fovea was 1.0 mm (range, 0–1.8 mm) in the I-125 plaque brachytherapy group and 0 mm (range, 0–3.6 mm) in the TTT group. The median tumor distance from the optic nerve head was 1.0 mm (range, 0.5–4.1 mm) in the plaque group and 0 mm (range, 0–2.36 mm) in the TTT group ( Table 1 3.2. Treatment Parameters Seven patients were treated with LIO-guided TTT. Of these, two received treatment at 500–600 mW, two at 700–800 mW, and two at 900 mW power. All patients received a single session of LIO-guided TTT performed under local anesthesia. In the LIO-guided TTT group, the mean applied power was 730 mW (range, 500–900 mW), with a mean exposure duration of 4 min for all patients. The limiting factor for the energy was whitening of the whole surface of the tumor with tolerable or no pain ( Figure 1 Six patients were treated by episcleral I-125 plaque brachytherapy. Two patients were treated with 16 mm COMS plaques, delivering an apex dose of 26 Gy and a base dose of 58 Gy, with corresponding foveal, optic disc, and lens doses of 7 Gy, 16 Gy, and 6 Gy, respectively. Two patients received 18 mm COMS plaques, delivering an apex dose of 26 Gy and a base dose of 58 Gy, with corresponding foveal, optic disc, and lens doses of 7 Gy, 16 Gy, and 6 Gy, respectively. The remaining two patients (with tumors touching the optic disc) received 18 mm notched plaques, delivering an apex dose of 24 Gy and a base dose of 56 Gy, with corresponding foveal, optic disc, and lens doses of 35 Gy, 44 Gy, and 3.8 Gy, respectively. Overall, the mean dose to the fovea was 14 Gy (range, 7–35 Gy), to the optic disc was 24 Gy (range, 16–44 Gy), and to the lens was 5 Gy (range, 3.8–6 Gy). 3.3. Management Outcome At the last date of follow-up, visual acuity improved in five out of seven patients (71%) treated with TTT, while none of the six plaque-treated patients demonstrated visual improvement. Vision remained stable in four (67%) plaque-treated and two (29%) TTT-treated patients, while two (33%) patients in the plaque group experienced further visual deterioration. None of the TTT-treated patients experienced visual deterioration ( Table 2 p OCT imaging was performed in all patients one month following radioactive plaque brachytherapy and LIO-guided TTT to assess subretinal fluid regression; no earlier evaluations were conducted. All patients exhibited a measurable reduction in tumor thickness following treatment. Median tumor thickness reduction was greater in the plaque group (−56%) compared to the TTT group (−36%). In the plaque group median initial thickness was 4.5 mm (range: 4.5–5.0 mm), reduced to 2.5 mm (range: 2.0–3.0 mm). In the TTT group median initial thickness was 3.8 mm (range: 2.9–5.0 mm), reduced to 1.4 mm (range: 0.9–1.8 mm). The difference in tumor thickness reduction between the two groups was statistically not significant ( p Figure 2 Figure 3 Both treatment groups demonstrated similar efficacy in achieving complete resolution of subretinal fluid, regardless of treatment modality ( Figure 2 Figure 3 Table 2 4. Discussion This study demonstrates the efficacy of laser indirect ophthalmoscopy-guided transpupillary thermotherapy (LIO-TTT) in the management of symptomatic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (CCH) compared with radioactive plaque therapy in the absence of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Both modalities achieved tumor control, reduction in tumor thickness, and complete resolution of subretinal fluid; however, LIO-TTT proved superior in preserving visual function. Subretinal fluid, which is the main cause for vision loss in CCH, improved or resolved in all patients across both treatment groups. This confirms the effectiveness of both modalities in the treatment of macular edema as shown in previous studies [ 3 6 21 1 3 6 11 18 21 Peripheral choroidal hemangiomas generally require only observation, as they do not typically affect visual acuity. Treatment is indicated for symptomatic lesions involving the macula or close to the macula and associated with macular edema. When such tumors are treated with radioactive plaque therapy, the radiation dose to the macula will be relatively high, often resulting in radiation retinopathy. In our series, most cases had tumors involving or abutting the fovea, with a mean radiation dose to the fovea of 14 Gy (range, 7–35 Gy) and to the optic disc of 24 Gy (range, 16–44 Gy). These relatively high doses of radiation may cause radiation retinopathy and radiation optic neuropathy, both of which may limit visual recovery in these eyes after treatment. Furthermore, radioactive seeds are not manufactured locally in Jordan and must be imported from overseas, typically causing treatment delays of more than two months. Such delays can lead to further photoreceptor damage due to chronic subretinal fluid or exudative retinal detachment, thereby reducing the potential for visual improvement. Compared to radioactive plaque brachytherapy, LIO-guided TTT has key advantages: it is less invasive (as it does not require surgical implantation of a radioactive plaque), office-based, less expensive, and does not require hospitalization or specialized radiotherapy infrastructure. This makes it especially attractive in resource-limited settings where access to PDT or plaque therapy is restricted [ 3 7 21 Historically, PDT has been the preferred modality for symptomatic CCH due to its selectivity and favorable safety profile, offering good tumor regression with minimal retinal damage [ 3 6 10 ® 6 10 27 28 According to Shields et al. photodynamic therapy (PDT) is highly effective for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (CCH). In a series of 79 eyes with unilateral posterior CCH (mean thickness 3.0 mm), 116 PDT sessions were performed with a mean follow-up of 43 months. Good visual acuity (≥20/40) was achieved in 62% of patients, and 93% showed partial or complete resolution of subretinal fluid [ 18 11 3 6 19 21 21 p p p p 22 We believe our study is unique, being the first to use LIO-guided TTT, rather than the conventional slit-lamp-based TTT approach, for the management of choroidal hemangioma—A technique readily available in most ocular oncology centers, as it is routinely used in the treatment of retinoblastoma. However, our study has several limitations, including its retrospective design, small sample size, and single-center nature, which may introduce selection bias. A potential concern in this study could be selection bias; however, the allocation of patients to treatment groups was determined solely by the historical availability of therapies at our institution. Initially, plaque brachytherapy was the standard treatment for choroidal hemangioma because it was the only available treatment modality and PDT was not available, and later, LIO guided transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) was approved in our institution for this indication and therefore was adopted to assess its efficacy and visual outcomes. Therefore, patients received treatment according to the prevailing therapeutic approach at the time, rather than any clinical selection criteria, minimizing the risk of bias related to patient characteristics. Despite these limitations, the statistically significant difference in visual outcomes strongly supports the utility of LIO-guided TTT. Future prospective, multi-center studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to validate these findings and determine optimal patient selection criteria. 5. Conclusions Laser indirect ophthalmoscopy-guided transpupillary thermotherapy (LIO-guided TTT) represents an effective and accessible treatment modality for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. It demonstrated significantly superior visual outcomes compared to plaque brachytherapy, despite both treatments achieving comparable anatomical tumor regression and subretinal fluid resolution. These findings underscore the critical importance of choosing treatment approaches that not only control tumor growth (as it is a benign tumor) but also prioritize visual function. Given its noninvasive nature, low cost, and ease of implementation, LIO-guided TTT has the potential to become a first-line treatment, particularly in regions where photodynamic therapy is unavailable. Further prospective studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate its long-term efficacy and define its role in global ocular oncology practice.
