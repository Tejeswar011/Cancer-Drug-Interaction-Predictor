While fibrosis is a physiological component of wound healing, its persistence and dysregulation can drive chronic tissue damage and organ dysfunction. In autoimmune diseases, fibrosis arises from prolonged inflammation and immune system dysregulation, creating a vicious cycle that exacerbates tissue injury and promotes disease progression. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fibrotic processes across a range of immune-mediated and autoimmune conditions, including systemic sclerosis (SSc), morphea, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Finally, we discuss current and emerging antifibrotic strategies aimed at interrupting pathological ECM remodeling and restoring tissue homeostasis. fibrosis autoimmune disorders targeted therapies This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Fibrosis is a process characterized by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, particularly collagen, leading to the thickening and stiffening of tissues and organs [ 1 2 1.1. “Good” Fibrosis—A Physiological Process in Tissue Repair Fibrosis is often characterized as the degeneration of connective tissue, where excessive accumulation of collagen-rich ECM takes the place of functional tissue [ 2 2 Figure 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 1.2. “Bad” Fibrosis—A Pathological Process in Immune-Mediated and Autoimmune Disorders “Bad” fibrosis involves the same core mechanisms and pathways as those used in normal tissue repair [ 1 2 Figure 1 1 Figure 2 1.3. Fibroblasts as Central Players in Fibrosis Fibroblasts are spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells ubiquitously present in connective tissues throughout the body. They play a crucial role in maintaining tissue architecture by producing and remodeling the ECM, which provides mechanical support and regulates cellular behavior [ 1 4 5 1 3 4 5 Pathogenic fibroblast activation initiates a network of intracellular signaling pathways that sustain and amplify fibrotic processes. Central to this activation is TGF-β, which signals through both canonical SMAD-dependent and non-canonical pathways [ 4 6 4 6 4 4 4 6 4 Fibroblasts are also key mediators of immune–fibrotic crosstalk. Type I interferons (IFNs) act on fibroblasts to increase the production of profibrotic chemokines and to upregulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), establishing a positive feedback loop that amplifies inflammatory and fibrotic signaling [ 5 The convergence and extensive crosstalk between these biochemical and biomechanical pathways drive persistent myofibroblast differentiation, resistance to apoptosis, and ongoing extracellular matrix remodeling, leading to chronic, non-resolving fibrosis. Understanding the complex network of fibroblast activation and persistence is essential, as these processes underpin the pathological fibrosis observed across a range of immune-mediated and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we explore the mechanisms of fibrosis and its role in several immune-mediated and autoimmune diseases, including systemic sclerosis (SSc), morphea, autoimmune hepatitis (AI), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and discuss emerging antifibrotic therapies. 2. Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) 2.1. Clinical Presentation and Epidemiology of SSc SSc is an orphan disease characterized by autoimmunity, fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, and vasculopathy [ 7 8 8 SSc is a clinically heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterized by widespread fibrosis, vasculopathy, and immune dysregulation, affecting multiple organ systems. Patients may present with a combination of cutaneous, vascular, internal organ, and constitutional symptoms [ 8 8 9 7 7 8 7 8 8 9 2.2. Pathogenesis of Fibrosis in SSc The disease is triggered by environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals through epigenetic modification. Postulated triggers include infection, toxins, immune-mediated cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, anti-endothelial antibodies, and ischemia–reperfusion injury [ 8 10 11 12 11 11 Immune dysregulation plays a central role in SSc pathogenesis. Immune cell infiltration, primarily T cells, macrophages, mast cells, and B cells, drives chronic inflammation and fibrosis in affected organs ( Table 1 11 13 14 Fibroblast activation marks the final step of the disease cascade, leading to excessive ECM production and irreversible organ fibrosis ( Table 1 11 14 11 The shared pathological cascade is further influenced by various organ-specific modifying factors [ 11 11 11 15 11 15 15 11 11 Autoantibodies are the most commonly used biomarkers in SSc and are most specifically useful for the diagnosis, classification, and prognosis of SSc [ 13 16 16 17 11 16 16 2.3. Current and Emerging Therapies in SSc Therapy in SSc focuses on symptom management, slowing disease progression, and preserving organ function, as there is currently no cure. Treatment strategies vary depending on disease subtype, limited versus diffuse cutaneous, and the extent of organ involvement [ 9 13 18 19 Antifibrotic agents approved for pulmonary fibrosis, such as nintedanib and pirfenidone, have been evaluated in SSc-ILD trials ( Table 2 19 20 13 19 In addition to potential disease-modifying therapies, it is essential to address exacerbating factors such as GERD and intercurrent infections. For patients with end-stage lung fibrosis, lung transplantation remains the only option that can significantly improve long-term outcomes [ 19 9 13 13 13 CAR-T cell therapy is an emerging and highly promising approach. A study of CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy in six patients with refractory SSs showed profound improvements in disease activity, with halted fibrosis progression and discontinuation of all prior immunosuppressive and antifibrotic treatments [ 21 JAK-STAT inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, also represent an evolving therapeutic avenue ( Table 2 22 23 3. Morphea 3.1. Clinical Presentation and Epidemiology of Morphea Morphea, a localized scleroderma, is distinct from SSc autoimmune connective tissue disorders that, despite sharing certain clinical and pathological features, differ significantly in their pathogenesis, systemic involvement, and disease course. Both conditions are characterized by inflammation, vascular abnormalities, and skin fibrosis driven by dysregulated immune responses and excessive collagen production. However, morphea is typically limited to the skin and underlying tissues, lacking internal organ involvement, and differs in immunologic profiles, clinical management, and prognosis. Morphea is generally characterized by the inflammatory patches and bands of thickened skin on the head, neck, trunk, and extremities of the body, occurring as a result of the abnormal deposition of collagen caused by both inflammatory and fibrotic components [ 24 24 25 3.2. Pathogenesis of Fibrosis in Morphea Morphea can manifest in varied clinical forms, categorized into five main subtypes: limited, generalized, linear, deep, and mixed [ 24 Table 1 24 24 3.3. Current and Emerging Therapies in Morphea The current treatment options for morphea are limited and often suboptimal. Both topical and systemic therapies are employed, with topical agents including corticosteroids, tacrolimus, vitamin D analogs, and imiquimod [ 24 Table 2 24 26 27 28 25 29 29 29 4. Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) 4.1. Clinical Presentation and Epidemiology of AIH AIH is a rare and progressive chronic immune-inflammatory liver disease [ 30 31 32 33 34 The clinical presentation of AIH is not characteristic, ranging from totally asymptomatic and mild forms with nonspecific symptoms, like malaise, lethargy, nausea, anorexia, pruritus, and jaundice, to severe hepatitis [ 30 30 30 4.2. Pathogenesis of Fibrosis in AIH Although the exact etiology of AIH remains unclear, it is believed that a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers underlies disease development [ 32 35 In AIH, this immune dysregulation leads to chronic liver inflammation. A key event is the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the liver, such as Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and dendritic cells, which present hepatic autoantigens via MHC molecules to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ( Table 1 32 35 32 32 Chronic liver inflammation leads to progressive tissue damage and fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive ECM deposition, primarily collagen ( Table 1 36 36 36 36 As fibrosis progresses, ECM deposition increases 6–8-fold [ 37 38 39 40 30 41 42 43 44 31 45 30 4.3. Current and Emerging Therapies in AIH The first-line therapy for AIH typically involves a combination of corticosteroids (prednisolone) and the immunosuppressant azathioprine (AZA) ( Table 2 30 30 32 AIH, if left untreated, can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure, highlighting the need for effective therapeutic strategies. With standard treatments, many patients experience relapses, treatment intolerance, or insufficient response. In recent years, adult stem cells (ASCs) have emerged as promising candidates for regenerative and immunomodulatory therapies in AIH [ 46 46 47 46 Several targeted therapies for liver fibrosis are also under investigation, aiming to reduce hepatocyte apoptosis (e.g., Emricasas—pan-caspase inhibitor, Selonsertib—ASK1 inhibitor), oxidative stress (e.g., resveratrol, NOX1/4 inhibitor), HSC activation (e.g., obeticholic acid—FXR agonist), and immune-driven inflammation (e.g., Cenicriviroc—CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor, Belapectin—galectin-3 inhibitor) [ 36 Table 2 40 40 40 40 48 35 5. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) 5.1. Clinical Presentation and Epidemiology of SLE SLE is a multifactorial, chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by pervasive immune dysregulation and multisystem inflammation [ 49 50 The disease is defined by a breakdown in immunological self-tolerance, leading to the immune system erroneously targeting endogenous tissues [ 51 52 The etiopathogenesis of SLE is primarily driven by an aberrant immune response in genetically predisposed individuals, precipitated by environmental triggers such as microbial infections, hormonal fluctuations, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. A key pathogenic mechanism involves the defective clearance of apoptotic cells, leading to the persistence of nuclear self-antigens that potentiate chronic immune activation [ 53 Abnormalities in the innate immune system, particularly excessive type I IFN signaling, are central to both the initiation and amplification of inflammatory cascades. These innate immune responses subsequently engage and dysregulate components of the adaptive immune system. Notably, B lymphocyte hyperactivity in SLE leads to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, including ANAs and anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies [ 54 55 Genomic studies, particularly genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified more than 100 susceptibility loci associated with SLE. These loci predominantly affect genes involved in immune regulation, antigen processing and presentation, and type I IFN signaling pathways [ 56 57 SLE is characterized by marked clinical heterogeneity, presenting a considerable challenge for both diagnosis and therapeutic management. This variability arises from the multifaceted involvement of multiple organ systems and underlying genetic diversity among affected individuals. Historically, therapeutic interventions have predominantly employed broad-spectrum immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cytotoxic agents, and antimalarial medications. Although these treatments are effective in attenuating disease activity, they are not curative and are frequently associated with significant adverse effects [ 58 The heterogeneity of clinical manifestations and pathophysiological mechanisms complicates the standardization of clinical trial designs and highlights the necessity for individualized treatment strategies. Current research efforts are focused on the development of targeted therapeutic modalities with enhanced safety and efficacy profiles. In particular, the long-term evaluation of combination therapies is ongoing to achieve more durable disease control and minimize treatment-related toxicity [ 59 SLE is estimated to affect approximately 3.4 million individuals worldwide, with an annual incidence of roughly 400,000 new cases [ 60 61 62 Ethnicity plays a pivotal role in modulating both the susceptibility to and clinical phenotype of SLE. Individuals of African ancestry—especially those residing in North America or Europe—are disproportionately affected, often presenting with earlier disease onset and higher prevalence compared to individuals of Northern European descent [ 63 A comprehensive global epidemiological study conducted in 2023 identified Poland, the United States, Barbados, and China as countries with notably elevated SLE incidence rates [ 60 SLE is a clinically and immunologically heterogeneous autoimmune disorder, characterized by considerable interindividual variability in disease onset, activity, and organ system involvement. Accurate diagnosis and clinical evaluation typically depend on standardized classification systems such as the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, alongside validated disease activity measures, including the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [ 64 5.2. Pathogenesis of Fibrosis in SLE Fibrosis in SLE results from persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and dysregulated tissue repair mechanisms. The pathological accumulation of ECM components leads to tissue scarring and organ dysfunction. Fibrotic remodeling may develop in multiple organs affected by systemic lupus erythematosus, including the kidneys, lungs, skin, and heart. These fibrotic alterations contribute significantly to chronic morbidity and may reduce responsiveness to therapeutic interventions [ 65 Renal fibrosis is a multifactorial and maladaptive pathological response triggered by diverse injurious stimuli, affecting either the glomerular or tubular structures of the kidney. This fibrotic process constitutes a common terminal pathway that underlies the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ultimately leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [ 66 65 67 Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a rare but serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. About 15% of SLE patients develop ILD, particularly nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) [ 68 69 69 Multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of fibrosis in SLE, with notable roles played by myofibroblasts, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), macrophages, TGF-β, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation pathways ( Table 1 Myofibroblasts are widely recognized as central mediators of fibrotic processes across various organs, including the kidneys and lungs [ 15 Table 1 70 71 Cells undergoing the EMT contribute to the fibrotic microenvironment by releasing pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines, such as TGF-β, IL-6, and TNF-α, which in turn stimulate the activation and differentiation of interstitial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts ( Table 1 71 72 Macrophages represent another cellular component implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, where they constitute a dominant component of the inflammatory infiltrate. Distinct macrophage phenotypes exert divergent roles in the initiation and progression of LN. Classically activated macrophages (M1) are characterized by their pro-inflammatory profile, including the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 [ 73 73 74 74 The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis across multiple organs, including the kidneys, lungs, and heart ( Figure 2 75 Subsequently, they activate transcription factors that promote the production of ECM components, such as collagen and glycoproteins, thereby increasing ECM deposition. Additionally, they inhibit the activity of metalloproteinases, reducing ECM degradation [ 76 77 76 Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of tissue injury, where they can undergo a specialized form of programmed cell death known as NETosis, leading to the release of NETs. While NETs serve an essential antimicrobial function by trapping and neutralizing pathogens, their dysregulated release has been implicated in exacerbating tissue injury and promoting inflammatory responses [ 78 79 80 80 80 5.3. Current and Emerging Therapies in SLE Conventional therapeutic approaches in SLE primarily aim to suppress the immune response and control systemic inflammation. However, these strategies often fall short in preventing or reversing the progression of fibrosis once it is established. Current clinical management of fibrotic complications in SLE involves the use of broad immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, MMF, and CYC ( Table 2 Table 2 81 82 Efforts to interfere with the TGF-β pathway—a central driver of fibrosis—have included the development of neutralizing antibodies [ 83 84 85 Table 2 86 87 Emerging evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy may offer a novel strategy for addressing fibrosis in autoimmune diseases ( Table 2 88 Despite these advances, there remains a lack of approved therapies specifically targeting fibrotic manifestations in SLE. This underscores an urgent need for the development of targeted antifibrotic agents that are both effective and safe in the context of autoimmune pathology. 6. Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS) 6.1. Clinical Presentation and Epidemiology of SS SS is a chronic systemic autoimmune condition distinguished by immune-mediated damage to the salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in symptoms such as dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia). This syndrome is classified as “primary” when it occurs independently and “secondary” when it is associated with other autoimmune connective tissue disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic sclerosis. From a serological perspective, the presence of ANA, rheumatoid factor (RF), and specific autoantibodies such as Ro/SSA and La/SSB is commonly observed in individuals with SS [ 89 The pathogenesis of SS is multifaceted, involving both genetic susceptibility and environmental influences. Various infectious agents, particularly viruses, have been proposed as potential triggers for the development of SS. Notably, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has been identified in biopsies of the lacrimal glands, as well as in saliva and specimens from salivary glands [ 90 91 Genetic factors are believed to significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of SS. Genomic studies have demonstrated associations between specific HLA alleles, such as DRB103:01, DQA105:01, and DQB1*02:01, and an increased susceptibility to SS [ 92 93 Epithelial cells are recognized as critical contributors to the pathogenesis of SS [ 94 94 95 96 Additionally, local inflammatory responses and the presence of cytokines, including IFN-γ and TNF-α, may disrupt the integrity of tight junctions within epithelial cells, resulting in modifications to cell polarity and structural organization [ 97 SS predominantly affects women, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 9:1, particularly among individuals of middle age [ 98 99 100 Epidemiological studies have highlighted the impact of geographical location and ethnicity on the prevalence of primary SS, revealing that individuals of non-European descent exhibit over two-fold the prevalence compared to their European counterparts, in addition to demonstrating distinct disease profiles [ 101 102 While SS does not correlate with an increased risk of mortality compared to the general population, it significantly impacts patients’ daily activities due to a high incidence of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and reduced physical performance [ 103 As no curative therapy for SS currently exists, treatment strategies primarily aim to mitigate the symptoms associated with exocrine gland dysfunction and manage systemic, extra-glandular involvement. In 2019, the EULAR task force issued revised guidelines for the therapeutic management of SS, encompassing both topical and systemic treatment modalities [ 104 The initial management of sicca symptoms should prioritize local therapies, reserving systemic interventions for cases with active systemic manifestations. Treatment of organ-specific involvement should follow a stratified approach, escalating therapy according to disease severity and response. Glucocorticoids should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration to control disease activity. In cases requiring prolonged immunomodulation, conventional immunosuppressants may serve as glucocorticoid-sparing agents. For patients presenting with severe or treatment-refractory systemic features, B-cell-directed therapies, such as rituximab, epratuzumab, or belimumab, may be considered [ 104 6.2. Pathogenesis of Fibrosis in SS Fibrotic alterations have emerged as a relevant pathological component in SS, extending beyond the traditionally recognized exocrine dysfunction to involve multiple organ systems, including salivary glands, lungs, heart, and kidneys. Although SS has been predominantly categorized as an autoimmune disorder targeting exocrine tissues, recent insights indicate that fibrogenesis plays a critical role in disease progression and multi-organ compromise [ 105 Within the salivary glands (SGs), persistent inflammatory activity is thought to induce epithelial cell reprogramming via the EMT, contributing to both tissue atrophy and fibrotic remodeling [ 106 Table 1 107 106 108 109 110 The identification of prognostic indicators and implementation of effective screening strategies, particularly in individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), may facilitate earlier recognition of SS-associated lung disease [ 111 Renal involvement is another recognized extra-glandular manifestation of SS, most commonly presenting as tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN). This form of nephropathy is characterized histologically by lymphocytic infiltration of the renal interstitium, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. These pathological features mirror the glandular infiltration observed in SS and contribute to progressive renal functional decline [ 112 113 114 Cardiac fibrosis has also been increasingly identified as part of the systemic involvement in SS. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) studies have revealed a substantial frequency of myocardial fibrosis, including in patients without clinically apparent cardiac symptoms [ 115 115 116 Persistent inflammation within the salivary glands in SS is primarily sustained by effector T cell-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-21, and IL-6 [ 117 Table 1 118 119 120 The chronic accumulation of immune cells within glandular tissues can drive a pathological progression toward fibrosis. TGF-β, predominantly secreted by regulatory T cells, plays a central role in the fibrotic transformation of glandular tissues by inducing EMT. In patients with primary SS, TGF-β1 mediates fibrogenesis in the salivary glands via the classical TGF-β1/SMAD/Snail signaling cascade [ 121 122 117 119 123 124 125 In the context of fibrotic mechanisms in SS that are independent of immune cell activity, the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts represents a critical event in the progression of salivary gland (SG) fibrosis [ 117 6.3. Current and Emerging Therapies in SS A wide range of therapeutic options is currently employed to alleviate sicca symptoms in SS, including artificial saliva and systemic secretagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline, which function as muscarinic receptor agonists and have demonstrated efficacy in reducing xerostomia symptoms [ 126 Table 2 127 128 129 Table 2 130 Table 2 131 132 133 134 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 7. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 7.1. Clinical Presentation and Epidemiology of IBD IBD is widely recognized as a common chronic immune-mediated disease that occurs primarily in the intestine, and the presence of fibrosis is associated with persistent inflammation. IBD is characterized by the development of fibrotic strictures due to chronic inflammation and dysregulated repair mechanisms. Among IBD, two disease entities predominate: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). They are chronic, heterogeneous, lifelong diseases with a young age of onset and high potential for disability. As described by M. Vath, the natural history of inflammatory bowel diseases is influenced by many factors of both environmental and genetic origin [ 142 143 According to estimates, more than 1 million people in the US and 2.5 million in Europe suffer from IBD [ 144 145 The clinical features of IBD, among chronic or remitting/relapsing inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract [ 146 147 147 147 7.2. Pathogenesis of Fibrosis in IBD Fibrosis in the intestinal tract is an elaborate procedure involving multiple elements and mechanisms, e.g., chronic inflammation, the presence of intestinal mesenchymal cells, and ECM remodeling. In normal conditions, fibrosis occurs due to tissue repair post-injury to protect the architecture of tissues. It is well known that acute inflammation is a key driver of multi-organ fibrosis. In patients with IBD, recurrent and chronic inflammation causes continuous inflammation of the mucosa, leading to the deposition of ECM proteins (e.g., fibronectin, collagen), resulting in progressive fibrosis [ 148 The most important elements influencing fibrosis include inflammatory substances from several sources, such as growth factors, as well as different interleukins. It has also been shown that sustained intestinal inflammation leading to high levels of cytokines (e.g., TGF-β, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17) provokes activation of fibroblasts, converting them into ECM-producing myofibroblasts [ 149 150 Table 1 151 152 150 153 147 154 Table 1 155 143 The two processes of EMT and EndoMT have also been confirmed to be important in the formation of fibrosis. It has been shown that damaged epithelial/endothelial cells in IBD can transform into myofibroblasts, thus consolidating fibrosis. The presence of EMT is well documented in Crohn’s strictures [ 149 149 156 ECM accumulation can be regulated by MMPs and their inhibitors, TIMPs [ 157 123 158 The state of the microbiota is also important in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. A recent study by L. Chen et al. confirmed that dysbiosis and altered bacterial signaling through TLRs exacerbate chronic inflammation and fibrosis progression [ 159 160 GWAS have identified several genetic pathways for IBS pathogenesis, but most of them have not been confirmed yet. Genetic susceptibility has been associated with genes, e.g., NOD2, TLR4, IL23R, IL12B, JAK2, CX3CR1, STAT3, ATG16L1, IRGM, FUT2, TGF-β, MMP3, and MAGI1, which modulate inflammatory and fibrotic pathways [ 161 162 163 7.3. Current and Emerging Therapies in IBD The etiopathogenesis of IBS is comprehensive, and available treatment strategies and emerging therapies are based on different mechanisms of fibrosis, but they have not been implemented in clinical practice. Surgical interventions are not a common practice in patients with IBD. The mainstay of treatment is lifestyle modification, diet, additional supplementation, and medications to alleviate specific IBD symptoms. Conventional therapy includes anti-inflammatory (aminosalicylates, corticosteroids) and immunosuppressive approaches with immunomodulators (e.g., Thiopurines and Methotrexate), which are often part of combination therapy with advanced therapies (TNF inhibitors, integrin/interleukin antagonists, JAK inhibitors, S1p modulators) [ 164 Table 2 165 With regard to pro-fibrogenic mediators, the main player is TGF-β1 with all its downstream effectors. TGF-β1 levels have been shown to be strongly correlated with the activation of angiotensin II, which is observed in the colonic mucosa of CD patients. Based on this, it was hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and sartans (angiotensin II receptor antagonists) may play a role in intestinal fibrogenesis ( Table 2 166 167 Table 2 168 169 An extensive group of therapeutic targets in the treatment of fibrosis is metalloproteinases. The presence of the metalloprotease Adamdec1 is essential at the interface between tissue remodeling and healing in colitis [ 170 Rho kinase (ROCK) plays multiple roles in TGF-β-induced myofibroblast activation, which may also be therapeutic targets in fibrotic diseases. The use of a ROCK inhibitor (AMA0825) reduced the TGF-β1-induced activation of myocardin-related transcription factor and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), reducing the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, collagen, and IL6 from fibroblasts. It is noteworthy that combining AMA0825 with anti-inflammatory agents such as anti-TNF-α in vivo alleviated inflammation but also prevented fibrous tissue accumulation, highlighting the importance of combination therapy [ 166 171 Table 2 172 Despite numerous studies on the mechanism of fibrosis, key cellular factors and biomarkers for the early detection of fibrosis in IBD are still not fully understood. Based on selected data, it seems that a personalized approach and a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic strategies are crucial in the treatment of IBD. 8. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) 8.1. Clinical Presentation and Epidemiology of RA RA is a disorder that belongs to Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases (SARDs), a group of immune-mediated disorders characterized by diverse clinical manifestations. The main causes of SARD development include environmental, genetic, and immune factors, with a strong impact of inflammatory responses. RA affects approximately 0.5 to 2% of the general population. Particularly, women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are often affected. In a cross-sectional study with the use of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), Z. Zang et al. indicated that the RA-related incidence rate increased from 11.66 to 13.48 per 100,000 population from 1990 to 2021 [ 173 174 175 In the active phases of RA, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are elevated. RA can also be characterized by the presence of autoantibodies, such as RF, which is not specific for RA, unlike anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), which is considered highly specific for the disease and can be detected long before the first symptoms of RA appear [ 175 176 177 178 179 Chronic inflammation is one of the main factors causing fibrosis, which affects many organs in RA. The presence of chronic inflammation in RA (synovitis) can also lead to fibrosis in the joints themselves, contributing to their stiffness and limited range of motion. In addition, fibrosis can also occur in other organs affected by RA, such as the heart (myocardial fibrosis) and kidneys, although lung involvement is the most pronounced [ 174 175 180 175 181 174 182 8.2. Pathogenesis of Fibrosis in RA The mechanisms driving fibrosis in RA are mainly connected with chronic inflammation in joints (synovitis) and fibrotic transitions in lung tissue. The mechanisms that occurred are comprehensive and are mainly connected with synovitis, activation of fibroblasts, and their differentiation into myofibroblasts and deposition of ECM. One of the major players among the mechanisms of fibrosis in both joints and lungs in RA is TGF-β1/3. It has been shown that RA synovial fluid is rich in active TGF-β and activates canonical Smad2 signaling, inducing α-SMA expression in MSCs and fibroblasts. It was also confirmed that RA synovial fluid induces α-SMA via TGF-β1/Smad2, while blocking TGF-βRI or neutralizing TGF-β prevents myofibroblast conversion, confirming the key role of this pathway [ 183 184 185 Under normal conditions, fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are crucial for maintaining cartilage integrity and function by producing ECM and synovial fluid components. In the context of RA, these cells become hyperactive and hyperproliferative with an aggressive phenotype that alters the joint microenvironment by producing MMPs that degrade the ECM. It is known that in RA, synovial fibroblasts can promote inflammation and cartilage destruction, while the interaction between T cells and synovial fibroblasts promotes the activation of synovial fibroblasts [ 182 186 187 Table 1 188 The EMT process is also relevant to the occurrence of fibrosis in RA. The EMT process of the synovial membrane in RA joints has been observed. It was shown that synovial lining cells in healthy tissue expressed epithelial markers (e.g., E-cadherin, collagen IV), while samples from RA patients expressed the myofibroblast marker α-SMA ( Table 1 189 190 191 Fibrosis of the synovial membrane is known to lead to the accumulation of ECM proteins in RA patients, which is relevant to the clinical manifestations of the disease. A study of circulating fibrocytes, potential precursors of FLS, showed that fibronectin and MMP levels were higher in FLS compared to fibrocytes. RA-derived fibrocytes (circulating precursors) were compared with synovial fluid and FLS tissues and found that fibronectin and MMP3 were higher in FLS, while fibrocytes expressed more MMP9 [ 192 193 194 195 196 8.3. Current and Emerging Therapies in RA RA treatment focuses mainly on reducing inflammatory processes and alleviating symptoms of the disease. It was shown that PFD could effectively inhibit fibroblast proliferation, inhibit local inflammatory cell infiltration, reduce collagen deposition, and, furthermore, regulate wound healing and inhibit endothelial cell angiogenesis [ 197 198 Table 2 197 Other drugs being studied for the treatment of RA include nintedanib, commonly used in pulmonary fibrosis, and tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor [ 199 193 MSC-based therapeutic approaches have gained significant attention in RA treatment. Preclinical and early-phase clinical studies using bone marrow or umbilical-cord MSCs showed upregulation of TGF-β1 and IL-10, suppression of NF-κB activity in synovial fibroblasts, and reduced fibroblast cadherin-11 expression and invasive, inflammatory behavior [ 200 187 Table 2 9. Fibrosis Regression Anti-fibrotic drugs, for instance, nintedanib and pirfenidone, aimed at halting fibrotic progression, do not necessarily restore organ functionality, as the fibrotic ECM often retains biomechanical and biochemical cues that perpetuate the activation of myofibroblasts. Therefore, functional recovery necessitates the selective removal or replacement of this pathological ECM with a structurally and functionally normal matrix in a regulated manner [ 201 202 203 204 It was indicated that organs with limited regenerative potential, such as the lungs, exhibit a capacity for fibrosis resolution [ 201 205 206 207 207 The propensity for fibrotic regression appears to be organ-dependent and may vary according to the etiology of the fibrogenic insult and host-specific variables such as genetic predisposition, age, sex, and immune status [ 208 The resolution of fibrosis is primarily driven by the degradation of aberrant ECM components and the restoration of the matrix’s physiological mechanical and biochemical properties. In experimental models, targeted induction of myofibroblast apoptosis has been shown to trigger fibrosis resolution. Nonetheless, the precise cellular and molecular pathways governing ECM degradation post-myofibroblast clearance remain inadequately defined. Various cell types, including macrophages, fibroblasts, natural killer (NK) cells, and neutrophils, have been implicated in ECM degradation through their production of MMPs [ 3 The dismantling of fibrotic ECM, primarily composed of heavily cross-linked type I collagen, is initiated by collagenases such as MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-13, MMP-14, MMP-15, and MMP-16. Subsequent degradation is mediated by gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and other proteolytic enzymes like cathepsin K [ 209 210 211 10. Conclusions Fibrosis represents a central pathological process in a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases, contributing significantly to chronic tissue damage and functional decline. As highlighted in this review, the complexity of fibrotic mechanisms, spanning diverse cellular pathways and molecular mediators, underscores the need for a deeper understanding of its role in autoimmune pathology. Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with fibrotic complications across multiple organ systems, the development of effective, targeted antifibrotic therapies remains an urgent and unmet clinical need. Continued research into the mechanisms of fibrosis and the translation of this knowledge into innovative therapeutic approaches will be critical for improving outcomes in patients affected by autoimmune-mediated fibrotic disease.

Open 2017 6 1644 1653 10.1242/bio.027458 28970230 PMC5703610 Figure 1 Comparison of “good” fibrosis versus “bad” fibrosis. “Good” fibrosis refers to controlled, reparative ECM remodeling that supports tissue healing, whereas “bad” fibrosis involves excessive, disorganized matrix deposition leading to tissue dysfunction and pathological scarring. Arrows indicate an increase in the concentration of TGF-β and PDGF. (Created using BioRender.com Figure 2 The role of TGF-β signaling in fibrosis. TGF-β is a central mediator of fibrosis that initiates and sustains fibrotic remodeling through both canonical (SMAD-dependent) and non-canonical (SMAD-independent) pathways. Upon ligand binding, TGF-β receptors activate SMAD2/3 proteins, which form complexes with SMAD4 and translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of profibrotic target genes. Simultaneously, TGF-β represses antifibrotic genes and promotes the survival and persistence of myofibroblasts. The resulting gene expression program leads to excessive ECM deposition, tissue stiffening, and scarring.
