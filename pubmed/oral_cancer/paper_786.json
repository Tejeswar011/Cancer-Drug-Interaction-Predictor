Among them, swines are the main animal source of HEV. Open reading frame 3 (ORF3) is a multifunctional protein essential for swine hepatitis E virus (SHEV) infection and release, involved in biological processes such as intracellular signal transduction regulation. In our preliminary research, we utilized adenovirus-mediated overexpression of type IV SHEV ORF3 in HepG2 cells, extracted total RNA, and performed high-throughput long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and transcriptome sequencing. In this study, we screened and analyzed lncRNAs involved in the GO pathway: viral process (GO: 0016032), and combined them with differentially expressed mRNAs for target gene prediction. We identified two lncRNAs—lncRNA AL137002 AL049840 p AL137002 AL137002 AL049840 AL049840 AL049840 SHE SHEV ORF3 HepG2 virus response lncRNA-mRNA network Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0311 cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0446 the General Fund of Guizhou Agricultural Science and Technology 2024-27 the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities SWU-KT22013 This study was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (CSTB2022NSCQ-MSX0311, cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0446), the General Fund of Guizhou Agricultural Science and Technology (2024-27), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SWU-KT22013). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Background Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus from the hepatitis virus family, divided into eight genotypes (from HEV-1 to HEV-8) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 After HEV infection in pigs, hepatocytes became vacuolar degeneration and atrophy, scattered mononuclear pyknotic necrosis, infiltration and fibrosis of inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, proliferation of bile ducts in the portal area, proliferation of fibrous connective tissue, vasodilation, and hyperemia. The main symptoms of acute jaundice type are liver cell swelling and eosinophilic change, cholestasis, Kupffer cell proliferation, portal inflammation, and mild and moderate debris necrosis. The main symptoms of acute jaundice type are liver cell swelling and eosinophilic change, cholestasis, Kupffer cell proliferation, portal inflammation, and mild and moderate debris necrosis. The acute non-jaundiced type is liver cell swelling and obvious steatosis. A few pigs have yellow staining of the eye’s conjunctiva, sclera, and oral mucosa. Pregnant sows may even have abortions or stillbirths [ 7 The genome of mammalian HEVs, including swine HEVs, is a forward single-stranded RNA molecule with a size of approximately 7.2 kb and exhibits bicistronic properties. The HEV genome is capped at the 5′ end and consists of a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs)—ORF1, ORF2, ORF3, and 3′-UTR [ 8 9 10 11 Recent studies have shown that LncRNA plays a variety of biological roles in cells. Although they do not encode proteins, they are crucial in regulating gene expression, chromatin structure and function, cell differentiation and development, and disease occurrence. On a molecular level, long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in various stages of cellular processes, affecting chromatin structure, transcriptional regulation, formation of biomolecule aggregates, and baiting of proteins and other RNAs in different environments through interactions including RNA protein, RNA-DNA, and RNA-RNA [ 12 13 Therefore, given the pivotal role of the SHEV ORF3 protein and the emerging regulatory potential of lncRNA, investigating the viral response pathway of the SHEV offers significant research value. In this study, we utilized adenovirus-mediated overexpression of genotype IV SHEV ORF3 in HepG2 cells, performed transcriptome sequencing, and performed GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis. Significant differential expression of lncRNAs in viral infection and release pathways was identified for the first time, and their target genes were predicted. Therefore, we aim to explore the effect of SHEV ORF3 on the lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network in the viral replication and release pathway in HepG2 cells, laying the foundation for further elucidating the function of SHEV ORF3 and revealing the infection mechanism of SHEV. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. High Throughput Sequencing of Recombinant Adenovirus AD-ORF3 Overexpression Genotype IV SHEV pORF3, lncRNA, and Transcriptome in HepG2 Cells Adenoviruses ADV4-ORF3 and ADV4 negative control (ADV4-NC) were generated by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). HepG2 cells, obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Science, were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 5 HepG2 cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses AD-ORF3 and AD-GFPat a titer of 5 × 10 8 https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ® TM 14 15 TM 2.2. Bioinformatics Analysis Raw sequencing reads were processed using Cutadapt (v2.6) to remove adapter contamination, low-quality bases, and undetermined bases, followed by quality assessment with FastQC. Reads were mapped to the human genome using Bowtie 2 (v2.3.5.1) and HISAT2 (v2.2.1). Transcripts were assembled using StringTie, and known mRNAs and transcripts shorter than 200 bp were filtered out. The remaining transcripts were analyzed for lncRNA prediction [ 16 p Table 1 2.3. Prediction of lncRNA mRNA Regulatory Network for Viral Response Cycle Pathway of Genotype IV SHEV ORF3 in HepG2 Cells In this study, we primarily conducted cis-regulatory analysis on long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and investigated their regulatory effects on the expression of both lncRNAs and their neighboring genes. The prediction of target genes for cis-regulated lncRNAs was principally based on the differential expression of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) within a 100 kilobase pair (kbp) chromosomal range upstream and downstream. Through transcriptome sequencing, we identified two differentially expressed genes and five transcripts in HepG2 cells expressing type IV SHEV ORF3. Consequently, we integrated the analysis of lncRNAs in the viral response cycle pathway with transcriptome sequencing results to predict target genes for cis-regulated lncRNAs and to explore the lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network. 2.4. Prediction of lncRNA mRNA Binding Sites and Molecular Modeling The RNA-RNA binding site prediction was performed using IntaRNA2.0 in the online RNA-RNA interaction prediction software RNAInter (RNA Interactome Database) (rnainter.org/IntaRNA/accessed on 23 May 2025). IntaRNA2.0 evaluates the stability of RNA-RNA interactions while considering the accessibility of subsequences involved in the interactions. RNA–protein interactions between selected lncRNAs and target genes were predicted using AlphaFold 3.0 [ 17 https://alphafoldserver.com/ AL137002 AL049840 3. Results 3.1. Screening of lncRNAs Involved in Virus Replication and Release in HepG2 Cells Expressing Genotype IV SHEV ORF3 Through GO Pathway In HepG2 cells, we identified a total of 6564 transcripts, of which 62 were significantly differentially expressed. Additionally, 319 lncRNAs, including 124 known and 195 novel lncRNAs, were found to be mediated by type IV SHEV ORF3, as previously described [ 14 15 p AL137002 AL049840 Table 2 Figure 1 3.2. Four Validated lncRNAs Were Predicted as Potential mRNAs, and Their lncRNA mRNA Networks Were Preliminarily Explored The target gene of lncRNA AL137002 AL049840 Figure 2 Table 3 AL137002 AL137002 AL049840 AL049840 AL049840 Figure 3 3.3. Prediction of RNA-RNA Binding Sites and Construction of Molecular Models We selected the lncRNA AL137002 AL049840 AL137002 AL049840 A total of 14 RNA-RNA binding sites were screened, The predicted binding energies for lncRNA AL137002 AL049840 Table 4 The predicted RNA–protein complexes were evaluated using AlphaFold 3 confidence metrics. For the lncRNA–CUL4A and lncRNA–KLC1 interactions, pLDDT scores ranged from 0.53 to 0.58 on a scale of 0–1, indicating moderate to high confidence in the structural predictions. Additionally, the predicted aligned error (PAE) matrices showed low expected errors (<5 Å) at the core interface residues. Together, these metrics support the structural plausibility of the predicted binding interfaces and highlight their potential for further experimental validation. The prediction and molecular modeling of binding sites between lncRNA and protein RNA based on AlphaFold 3 are shown in Table 5 Figure 4 4. Discussion HEV is the fifth known viral hepatitis and one of the most common causes of acute viral hepatitis [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Host factors critically shape species barriers through receptor compatibility, cellular machinery, and immune defenses. Crucially, the host innate immune response, particularly interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), may restrict cross-species transmission by blocking viral propagation. Tolerance mechanisms, where hosts like swine limit disease severity without robust immunity, may facilitate viral persistence and spillover. Environmental and anthropogenic factors, including intensive pig farming, occupational exposure, and consumption of contaminated animal products, such as undercooked pork and camel milk, amplify HEV transmission opportunities. Evolutionary ecology reveals that prolonged host–virus contact drives specialization: HEV-3 and HEV-4 exhibit higher evolutionary rates, while HEV-1 and HEV-2 show refined human adaptation, linked to severe outcomes like maternal mortality [ 25 The HEV gene is approximately 7.2 kb long and consists of a short 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR, and three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3). Among them, ORF3 encodes small multifunctional phosphoproteins involved in viral body release. With the progress of research, the functions of more and more ORF3 proteins have been identified. It has been found that the HEV ORF3 protein plays an important role in viral body release and infection in vivo, and the ORF3 protein regulates host cell innate immunity by interacting with various intracellular signaling pathways [ 26 27 28 29 Detection methods for Hepatitis E virus HEV primarily utilize molecular techniques targeting viral nucleic acids and serological techniques detecting host antibodies or viral antigens. Serological methods primarily employ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ELISA to detect anti-HEV antibodies IgM, indicating recent infection or IgG, as well as past exposure or antigens signifying current infection, providing high-throughput screening capability crucial for epidemiological studies and clinical diagnosis. Molecular approaches like reverse transcription PCR RT-PCR and its highly sensitive real-time quantitative variant RT-qPCR amplify conserved genomic regions such as ORF2 or ORF3, enabling precise viral load quantification and genotype analysis. Conventional reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays have been extensively developed and deployed across China to detect HEV RNA, primarily focusing on conserved regions within the ORF2 and ORF3 genes due to their critical roles in viral structure and function. ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein, which is essential for virion assembly and host cell entry, making it a highly immunodominant and genetically stable target ideal for diagnostic assays. Meanwhile, ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional phosphoprotein involved in viral pathogenesis and egress, offering additional conserved sequences for reliable detection. Amplification of these ORF regions allows not only for the identification of HEV presence but also enables subsequent genetic characterization, including genotype determination and phylogenetic analysis, through sequencing of the RT-PCR products [ 30 The current development of the HEV primarily focuses on utilizing recombinant technology involving the ORF2 capsid protein, which has the ability to spontaneously self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs mimic the structure of natural virus particles and display crucial neutralizing epitopes. This approach boasts notable advantages, such as the non-infectious nature of VLPs, high inherent safety, robust immunogenicity, and its capacity to effectively elicit the production of potent neutralizing antibodies [ 31 32 The lifecycle of viruses is usually coordinated by precise mechanisms that act on their RNA [ 33 34 35 36 Recent findings suggest that lncRNAs play different regulatory roles in various major biological and pathological processes. During the lifecycle of a virus, lncRNAs participate in a series of steps, including enhancing virus gene expression, promoting virus replication and genome packaging, facilitating virus particle release, maintaining virus latency, and assisting virus transformation [ 37 Our study discovered a new mechanism by which ORF3 participates in regulating the host lncRNA network and affecting virus release. This aligns with prior evidence that ORF3 relies on its PSAP motif for virion release and interacts with cellular trafficking machinery [ 27 29 Based on the analysis of infectious cDNA clones and mutagenesis studies of rat HEV, the ORF3 protein plays an indispensable role in the release of mature viral particles from infected cells by facilitating the formation and egress of membrane-associated, enveloped virions, primarily through a conserved proline-rich motif within its C-terminal region, where the specific proline residues at positions 93 and 96 are critically required for this function, as their mutation disrupts the proper interaction with host cellular machinery, thereby preventing the efficient budding and release of lipid-coated particles that shield the viral capsid and carry the ORF3 protein on their surface, while intracellular viral replication and protein synthesis remain unaffected, indicating that ORF3 acts as a key adaptor protein mediating the final envelopment and secretion steps rather than viral genome replication or capsid assembly, and this mechanism functionally substitutes for the PSAP motif found in ORF3 proteins of other HEV genotypes, highlighting its essential and conserved role in generating infectious, membrane-associated HEV progeny [ 38 The emergence of lncRNAs as master regulators of viral life cycles offers a compelling lens through which to reinterpret HEV-host interactions. We identified two ORF3-responsive lncRNAs ( AL137002 AL049840 AL137002 39 The inverse correlation between AL137002 AL049840 40 Our binding site predictions indicate that AL049840 The lncRNA-mRNA networks we constructed extend beyond correlation to propose testable mechanistic models: AL137002 AL137002 AL049840 AL049840 Recent studies have revealed that lncRNAs play important regulatory roles in the release and replication of various viruses. For instance, LncRNAs have been shown to exacerbate hepatitis C virus (HCV)-Induced Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through the miRNA-223-3p/NLRP3 molecular axis. The NF-κB-interacting long non coding RNA (NKILA) may act as a suppressor of HBV replication via modulating NF-ĸB signaling. Additionally, a novel LNC RNA termed dual function regulating influenza virus (DFRV) has been identified in the context of influenza virus infection. Upon infection with influenza A virus (IAV), DFRV undergoes alternative splicing to produce two distinct transcripts: the long-form DFRV inhibits viral replication over an extended period, whereas the short-form DFRV enhances viral replication [ 41 42 43 AL137002 AL049840 AL137002 AL049840 Our AlphaFold3.0 models of lncRNA–protein interactions represent a pioneering approach in HEV research. The primary advantage of AlphaFold lies in its ability to generate high-precision protein structural models and predict potential lncRNA–protein and protein–RNA binding interfaces using deep learning, leveraging metrics such as predicted interface pLDDT scores and residue contact probabilities. This capability accelerates the structural characterization of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), particularly for targets like porcine HEV-ORF3 lacking experimental structures, providing a theoretical foundation for designing point mutation experiments or competitive inhibitors. Below is a revised version of the provided text, improving clarity, conciseness, and scientific precision while maintaining the original structure and intent. The revision enhances readability, ensures consistent terminology, and aligns with standard scientific writing conventions for molecular biology and RNA research. We also contextualize the text with respect to the prior submissions on lncRNA–HEV-ORF3 interactions in HepG2 cells and the AlphaFold3.0 modeling (artifact_id: a328be69-d818-42d0-a6d8-8cdc3ade537c), assuming potential relevance to the NIH R03 proposal or a related HEV-focused study. The revision addresses the biological significance and limitations of lncRNA–mRNA binding site predictions, integrating seamlessly with the experimental validation strategies proposed. Furthermore, regarding the predicted binding energies for the RNA–protein interactions, it is important to note that these in silico values, generated by tools like AlphaFold3 and IntaRNA, are computational estimates. The models are typically generated in vacuo or in an implicit solvation model, which does not fully account for the complex entropy contributions of explicit water molecules upon binding, nor the precise electrostatic and dynamic conditions of the cellular environment. Consequently, the absolute values of the binding energies should be interpreted with caution, as they may not directly reflect the true binding affinities in vivo. However, the relative differences in binding energies between various predicted interaction sites for our specific lncRNA-mRNA/protein pairs are considered robust enough for comparative analysis within the scope of this study. These predictions serve to identify the most probable and stable binding interfaces, allowing us to prioritize key sites for subsequent experimental validation. The primary utility of these energy values lies not in their absolute accuracy but in their ability to rank and compare potential interactions, thus providing a solid computational foundation for generating testable hypotheses about the functional roles of AL137002 AL049840 However, it is important to note that AF3 has limitations, including potential inaccuracies in predicting complex RNA tertiary structures and a tendency to generate over-confident predictions in low-complexity regions. Therefore, while our computational models provide valuable hypotheses, they require validation through wet lab experiments such as EMSA, RIP, and mutational analyses. The biological significance of predicting lncRNA–mRNA binding sites lies in elucidating how non coding RNAs regulate gene expression by modulating mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and subcellular localization, as well as participating in competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. These mechanisms influence critical biological processes, including cell differentiation, development, and disease pathogenesis, such as in porcine HEV infection. However, computational predictions have notable limitations: they primarily rely on sequence complementarity and conservation, often overlooking RNA secondary and tertiary structures, specific spatial conformations required for binding, and the roles of protein complexes. This leads to high false-positive rates, with in vivo binding sites often fewer than predicted and not always functionally relevant. Following the bioinformatics predictions, experimental validation will include EMSA to verify direct binding between the identified lncRNAs ( AL137002 AL049840 5.
