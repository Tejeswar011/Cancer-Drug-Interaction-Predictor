Renal papillary necrosis (RPN) is a particular form of renal injury characterized by necrosis of the renal papilla identified through imaging and histological investigation. RPN generally occurs in the setting of urinary obstruction, urinary infection, sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. We present a case of RPN in a patient on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy who developed immunotherapy-induced severe colitis followed by obstructive acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient lacked other risk factors for RPN. Initial imaging with computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed bilateral perinephric edema, mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, and high attenuation material at bilateral ureterovescular junctions. Supportive care with isotonic fluids led to passage of tissue in urine and AKI recovery. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed 3 weeks after AKI hospitalization revealed multiple pyramids with a bullseye enhancement pattern consistent with prior RPN. Although ICIs have well-recognized nephrotoxicity, this case is the first to describe RPN in the setting of an ICI immune-related adverse event.

These immunomodulatory antibodies have significant immune-related adverse events including nephrotoxicity. Tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most commonly identified etiology of ICI-associated acute kidney injury (AKI). 1 2 Case Report A 33-year-old man with a history of metastatic melanoma with brain metastases presented with thirst, flank pain, and hematuria for 2 days. His oncologic history included the diagnosis of left frontal lobe mass in April 2023 when he presented to the hospital with confusion and headache. He underwent left frontal craniotomy for evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with the mass. Pathology confirmed melanoma. He received fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy to the resection cavity followed by initiation of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab in May 2023. Five weeks later, cycle 3 of immunotherapy was completed, but he required hospitalization for diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Clostridium difficile Forty-eight hours after discharge, he developed severe thirst and dark red urine without the passage of clots, which prompted him to present to the emergency department. He reported improvement in diarrhea. His oral intake was reduced but denied nausea or vomiting. He denied dysuria, urgency, or frequency but did have severe bilateral flank pain that radiated to the pelvis. He denied fevers or chills, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and had no history of urinary tract infection or kidney stones. Medications included prednisone, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim thrice weekly, levetiracetam, and as needed acetaminophen, oxycodone, loperamide, and ondansetron. On examination, vital signs were a temperature of 36.2 °C, heart rate of 100, blood pressure of 124/87, respiratory rate of 15, and SpO2 of 100%. Physical examination revealed a young man in no acute distress. Mild tenderness to palpation was present in the epigastric and lower umbilical region. There was also right costoverterbal tenderness. Laboratory results were notable for a white blood cell count of 14.5 k/uL and hemoglobin level of 16.9 mg/dL. Chemistry panel showed a sodium level of 134 mmol/L, potassium level of 3.6 mmol/L, chloride level of 102 mmol/L, bicarbonate level of 20 mmol/L, serum urea nitrogen level of 21 mg/dL, creatine level of 1.46 mg/dL, glucose level of 159 mg/dL, and calcium level of 8.5 mg/dL (baseline kidney function had previously been normal with a serum creatinine level of 0.9-1.0 mg/dL). Dipstick urinalysis showed red slightly cloudy urine with specific gravity of 1.020, pH 6.0, negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrites, protein level estimated at 70 mg/dL, and 3+ hemoglobin. Automated microscopic examination of the urine showed 3-5 white blood cells per high-power field, >100 red blood cells per high-power field, and no bacteria. Urine sodium level was <20 mmol/L. Urine culture was obtained and was negative. Renal ultrasound showed normal echogenicity, size, and parenchymal thickness of both kidneys. There was mild bilateral hydronephrosis and decompressed bladder. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed right greater than left perinephric edema with mild bilateral hydroureteronephrosis with high-density globular material in the bilateral lower pole calyces. Additionally, there was high attenuation material at both ureterovescular junctions ( Fig 1 Figure 1 High attenuation debris is seen layering dependently in both right and left lower pole calyces (red arrows, image A) and affected at both ureterovesical junctions (red arrows, image B). There is bilateral pelvocaliectasis as a function of bilateral ureterovesical junction obstruction. The patient was admitted to the oncology service with nephrology and urology consulting. A 1 L 0.9% saine bolus was given followed by continuous infusion. He was continued on glucocorticoids for his prior history of immunotherapy-induced colitis. The patient noted passage of semisolid tissue-like sediment in the urine. Subsequently, flank pain resolved, and urine cleared to light yellow. Serum creatinine peaked at 2.12 mg/dL but improved to 0.9 mg/dL by discharge. Creatinine remained stable after discharge from the hospital, and repeat CT of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast 3 weeks later showed symmetric enhancement of the kidneys with no collecting system dilation. He required infliximab for control of colitis and glucocorticoids were tapered off. Two months after the episode of AKI, he was restarted on immunotherapy with nivolumab monotherapy which was continued for 11 months with stable kidney function before adjusting therapy because of disease progression. Discussion Dr Nikolas Friedreich first described a case of RPN in a patient with urinary obstruction because of prostate hypertrophy in 1877. 3 4 5 , 6 Cases of RPN in cancer patients described in the literature have generally resulted from urinary obstruction or urinary infection in the setting of acquired immunodeficiency. 6 7 8 9 10 ICIs are associated with a variety of immune-related adverse events including nephrotoxicity with the incidence of AKI of 2%-17%. 11 , 12 1 , 2 , 12 13 12 , 13 12 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can cause drug-induced interstitial nephritis; however, in this case, he had received only one dose before developing AKI. Our patient developed ICI-associated colitis 7 weeks after initiation of dual ICI therapy and was receiving treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids 3 days before his episode of AKI and RPN. The causal role of ICI in this case is uncertain. Although he had steroid-induced hyperglycemia, his hyperglycemia was mild (peak serum glucose 159 mg/dL), and he was not found to have other predisposing factors including urinary obstruction, urinary infection, hemoglobinopathy, or use of NSAIDs. Dehydration and mild volume depletion may have been contributing factors given our patient’s preceding episode of colitis, reported thirst, and reduced oral intake. However, his diarrhea was improving and on presentation was normotensive without hypernatremia. The histopathology of RPN appears as coagulative necrosis seen at the apex of the renal pyramid where urine is discharged from the renal tubules. 4 14 5 , 9 Diagnosis of RPN can be challenging given the nonspecific symptoms, and historically autopsy studies were instructive for describing clinical features. 15 , 16 17 , 18 Fig 2 6 Figure 2 Contrast-enhanced CT performed 3 weeks after treatment for the papillary necrosis shows multiple pyramids with a bullseye enhancement pattern (red arrows, image A). This is in contrast to the uniform enhancement seen on the scan several weeks before his renal insult (image B). References 1 Gupta S. Short S.A.P. Sise M.E.
