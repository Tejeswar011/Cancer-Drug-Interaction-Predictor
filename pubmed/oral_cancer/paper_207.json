The pathogenesis of MMP is only poorly understood, but inflammation in MMP is triggered by specific binding of autoantibodies directed to different proteins of the dermal-epidermal/-epithelial junction, subsequently leading to the influx of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils, into the dermis. Using the anti-laminin 332 antibody transfer model of MMP, we addressed the molecular mechanisms of neutrophil infiltration and its significance for the eruption of mucocutaneous lesions.

They affect the skin and diverse mucosal surfaces with subepidermal blisters and erosions because of an autoantibody-driven immune response against different proteins of the dermal-epidermal adhesion complex ( 1 2 1 3 5 MMP is a clinically and immunopathologically heterogenous disease. Autoantigens described in MMP include the C-terminus of type XVII collagen (BP180), BP230, laminin 332, integrin α6β4, and type VII collagen, with BP180 and laminin 332 as the major autoantigens ( 6 8 9 10 11 12 9 13 11 14 Histopathologically, both mucosal and cutaneous lesions exhibit a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, with neutrophils usually constituting the largest cell population ( 15 Recently, a novel mouse model mimicking the effector phase of MMP has been developed ( 16 16 18 In general, neutrophils can express more than 30 chemoattractant receptors, including the anaphylatoxin receptors C5aR1 and C5aR2, the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CCR1, the formyl peptide receptors FPR1 and FPR2, as well as the leukotriene B 4 4 19 22 23 18 18 4 4 4 Results Genetic deficiency in 5-lipoxygenase or BLT1 protects from both cutaneous and mucosal lesions in MMP. To elucidate the significance of leukotrienes in general and specifically of LTB 4 Alox5 Ltb4r1 Figure 1A Figure 1, A and B Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Figure 1, A and B Ltb4r1 –/– Alox5 –/– Figure 1B Ltb4r1 –/– Alox5 –/– Figure 1B We also quantified the number of neutrophils in 6 mm punch biopsies from the skin of wild-type mice left untreated, lesional skin from wild-type mice, and corresponding skin sites from Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Supplemental Figure 1 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.173914DS1 Figure 1C Ltb4r1 –/– Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Alox5 –/– To assess the involvement of mucosal surfaces, we determined the number of areas affected by inflammatory lesions in the oropharynx by endoscopy at the end of the experiment on day 16 ( Figure 2A Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Figure 2A Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Figure 2, B and C Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– + Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Figure 2D Furthermore, all wild-type mice but only 41% and 28% of Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Figure 2, E and G Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Figure 2F The BLT1 antagonist CP-105,696 ameliorates MMP. To further corroborate the potential of BLT1 as a pharmacological target in MMP, we assessed the effect of pharmacological inhibition of BLT1 in the MMP mouse model. For this purpose, MMP was induced in wild-type mice, which were treated with 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg body weight of the BLT1 inhibitor CP-105,696 or its vehicle daily by gavage. The administration of the drug was started with the first application of anti-LAMA332 IgG on day 0. CP-105,696 reduced the severity of skin inflammation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3, A and B Figure 3, A and B Figure 3, C and D Figure 3, E and F We next addressed whether 10 mg/kg CP-105,696 may still be effective in ameliorating disease if its administration is started after the establishment of the first inflammatory lesions. To this end, MMP was induced in wild-type mice, and daily treatment with 10 mg/kg CP-105,696 was started on day 0, 3, or 7. At all times initiated, treatment with CP-105,696 swiftly exerted an effect on skin inflammation, diluting its progression ( Figure 4, A and B Figure 4, C and D We also determined the number of neutrophils and macrophages in skin lesions on day 16 by flow cytometric analysis of single-cell suspensions. Treatment with CP-105,696 did not alter the number of macrophages ( Figure 4E Figure 4F LTB 4 To understand the role of LTB 4 24 19 Ltb4r1 –/– Ltb4r1 ΔPMN MRP8-Cre-ires/GFP Ltb4r1 Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Ltb4r1 Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Ltb4r1 Figure 5A Ltb4r1 Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Figure 5A Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Ltb4r1 4 4 Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Figure 5B We compared the course of MMP in Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Ltb4r1 –/– Alox5 –/– Figure 5 Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Figure 5, C and D Figure 5C Ltb4r1 –/– Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Figure 5, D and G Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Figure 5, E, F, H, and I Discussion The pathogenesis of MMP, including the contribution of different immune cell populations infiltrating the dermis, has remained largely elusive. In this study, we further unraveled the pathogenesis of MMP at the molecular and cellular levels by uncovering an essential role of LTB 4 4 Alox5 Ltb4r1 4 While the protection from inflammatory skin lesions was practically complete in Alox5 Ltb4r1 Ltb4r1 4 9 4 Our results give reason to further pursue the development of more effective pharmacological inhibitors of the LTB 4 4 25 26 4 27 Importantly, although meanwhile multiple studies have implicated LTB 4 4 Ltb4r1 Ltb4r1 –/– + + 28 29 4 Ltb4r1 –/– 4 18 19 29 36 4 29 32 37 38 29 19 33 37 4 4 33 The paramount importance of LTB 4 4 4 4 4 19 39 44 4 39 40 4 4 Collectively, the results of this study highlight neutrophils and the molecular mechanisms orchestrating their migration and actions as potential therapeutic targets for MMP.

PMN-specific Ltb4r1 –/– Ltb4r1 ΔPMN Ltb4r1 fl/fl Supplemental Table 1 All experiments were performed in age- and sex-matched mice aged 8–16 weeks. In experiments with Alox5 –/– Ltb4r1 –/– Ltb4r1 ΔPMN All mice used in this project were kept under specific pathogen–free conditions according to Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations recommendations and were bred and maintained in a barrier rodent facility of the University of Lübeck. Groups of 2–5 females and males were housed in Greenline GM 500 cages (Tecniplast, Thermo Fisher Scientific) lined with 4HK-13Kg Aspen bedding (Tapvei) and enriched with nesting material (Ssniff) in a photoperiod of 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark. Except for the experiments comparing global gene knockouts, the different experimental groups were housed together in the same cages to minimize cage effects. Food pellets (food type 1314) from Altromin and tap water were available ad libitum. Conduct of the antibody transfer model of anti-LAMA332 MMP and treatment with CP-105,696. The antibody transfer model of anti-LAMA332 MMP was induced, as previously described ( 18 45 The BLT1 antagonist CP-105,696 (Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in 10% ethanol, 0.5% methylcellulose, and 0.5% Tween 80, was administered by oral gavage daily at a dose of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg, as previously described ( 36 The mucosal involvement in the oral cavity was benchmarked using a scoring system from 0 to 4, as previously described ( 16 (Immuno-)histopathology. Biopsies of perilesional skin, i.e., skin directly adjacent to active inflammatory skin lesions, and of palpebral conjunctiva were fixed in 4% Histofix solution (Carl Roth GmbH). Biopsies were embedded in paraffin and cut to 6 μm sections. For histopathology, sections were stained with H&E. Ly-6G staining was performed on deparaffinized sections of perilesional skin. Antigens were retrieved using the Digest-All 3 pepsin solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT). Slides were washed with 0.01 M Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS) for 1 hour prior to the application of rat anti-mouse Ly-6G antibody (BioLegend; 1:100; 127603) in 5% (vol/vol) NGS application at 4°C overnight. After washing, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 AffiniPure Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:500; 111-545-144) for 1 hour at RT, washed again, and mounted with DAPI Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). Immunofluorescence staining for IgG and complement C3 was performed as previously described ( 46 Assessment of conjunctivitis. To assess conjunctivitis, paraffin biopsies of the palpebral conjunctiva were processed and stained with H&E, as described above. Each sample was cut at 3 levels, visualized using the Keyence HS All-in One Fluorescence Microscope at 200× original magnification, and evaluated for subepidermal split formation using the BZ II analyzer (Keyence GmbH). The severity of palpebral conjunctivitis was assessed by measuring the length of the largest split and applying the following scoring system: 0, no split; 1, <100 μm; 2, 100–199 μm; 3, 200–299 μm; 4, >299 μm. Immune cell infiltration analysis through flow cytometry. To describe the immune cell infiltrate in the skin, 6 mm biopsies from lesional skin, i.e., inflamed skin, and perilesional skin, i.e., skin directly adjacent to inflamed skin sites, were collected at the end of the experiment and processed into cell suspensions. Cell viability was determined using Viobility 405/452 Fixable Dyes (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were blocked using mouse FcR Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec). Staining proceeded with a master mix of antibodies against CD45 (rat anti-CD45 FITC; 1:100; BioLegend; 553080), CD11b (rat anti-CD11b Brilliant Violet 650; 1:100; BioLegend; 101259), Ly-6G (rat anti-Ly-6G PerCP Vio 700; 1:10; Miltenyi Biotec; 130-103-793; and rat anti-Ly-6G APC/Cy7; 1:100; BioLegend; 127624), F4/80 (rat anti-F4/80 PE; 1:100; BioLegend; 123110), and Siglec-F (rat anti–Siglec-F APC/Cy7; 1:100; BioLegend; 565527).
