In these cases, the cause may be secondary. On the other hand, it is known that platelet clotting dysfunction and fibrinolysis abnormalities are seen in the background of MDS, and primary fibrinolysis abnormalities may be complicated by adverse events associated with paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS). Coagulation fibrinolysis, as a PNS associated with MDS, is known to take the pattern of either consumptive coagulation abnormality or fibrinolytic coagulation abnormality. One mechanism of coagulation and fibrinolytic abnormalities has been shown to be the immunophenotypical pathway, and aberrant cytokine production is also associated with coagulopathy in MDS. We focused on how to differentiate an MDS-associated bleeding tendency resulting from either secondary or primary causes. In order to make this differentiation, we proposed a useful flowchart for the differentiation of solidified fibrinolysis seen at the initial MDS diagnosis. Additionally, we compared and summarized the molecular pathways of the secondary and primary causes of coagulopathy. Addressing coagulation and fibrinolytic abnormalities in MDS is required to differentiate the complexity and heterogeneity of bleeding and coagulation abnormalities. This review highlights the need to distinguish between the primary (disease-intrinsic) and secondary (reactive or complication-related) causes of coagulopathy. By proposing a diagnostic flowchart tailored to evaluate these causes at initial diagnosis, this study supports individualized risk stratification and management strategies. By comparing the molecular pathways of the two causes of coagulopathy, we provide a clinical discussion of the underlying pathologies. This aligns with the principles of personalized medicine by ensuring that treatment decisions (e.g., supportive care, anticoagulation, and antifibrinolytics) are based on the patient’s specific pathophysiological profile, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. myelodysplastic syndrome coagulopathy coagulation disseminated intravascular coagulation tumor lysis syndrome hemophagocytic syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis paraneoplastic syndrome tailored medicine personalized medicine JSPS KAKENHI 22K12842 24K18645 This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI, grant numbers 22K12842 and 24K18645. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a diverse bone marrow function disorder caused by an acquired genetic abnormality, presenting progressive cytopenia refractory to nutritional or growth factor treatment [ 1 2 Some MDS patients may develop a paraneoplastic consumptive coagulopathy or fibrinolytic process. Platelet dysfunction associated with MDS can contribute to bleeding tendencies. MDS-related platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications in affected individuals. Our study focusses on the following narrative case of MDS-complicated severe coagulopathy as a reference case: A 51-year-old male was referred to the hematology outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of fever. Blood tests revealed leukopenia and coagulation–fibrinolysis abnormalities. The diagnosis was febrile neutropenia. The bone marrow examination showed hyperplastic myeloid cells, with no significant increase in blast cells (0.1%). Quantitative dysplastic changes were observed in both granulocytic and erythroid lineages, leading to a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD) ( Figure 1 3 As indicated in this case, we often encounter coagulopathy cases in which the underlying disease should be distinguished. This is because primary coagulopathy in MDS is uncommon. Here, we considered the primary abnormality underlying coagulation and fibrinolysis to be paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) associated with MDS. In what follows, we offer a means of differentiating primary and secondary coagulation and fibrinolysis disorders. The goal of this review is to support a medical approach that tailors treatment and prevention strategies to the unique pathogenesis of each underlying disease. 2. Pathogenic Mechanism Inherited thrombocytopenia with platelet dysfunction is known as a genetic disease [ 4 The incidence of thrombocytopenia in MDS is 67% before treatment [ 2 5 6 In patients with MDS, platelets showed reduced activation capacity and more apoptosis signs than controls [ 7 8 9 10 10 10 11 11 Based on clinical observation, coagulopathy related to thrombin formation has been shown in MDS patients [ 12 12 13 9 14 In recent research, VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome was proposed as an autoimmune disease, exhibiting auto-inflammation presenting arthritis and vasculitis [ 15 16 3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) A combination of the keywords “MDS” and “disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)” yielded only 14 results in a PubMed search (on 7 July 2025). However, no fully matched articles were found. This suggests that MDS is commonly comorbid with DIC. Increased blast counts can promote the comorbidity of DIC [ 17 17 18 18 4. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Similarly to the search for MDS and DIC, a PubMed search using the keywords “MDS” and “tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)” yielded sixteen results (on 7 July 2025) with only two valuable articles. These results included a case of infection-induced TLS in an MDS patient complicated by fungemia [ 19 20 21 22 23 23 24 A single case report introduced a case of low-risk MDS with TLS without chemotherapy or immunotherapy [ 25 5. Infection Infection is a common complication in MDS [ 26 27 28 27 28 29 29 30 6. Thromboembolism Thromboembolism associated with MDS is partially related to some key drugs used to treat MDS, such as lenalidomide [ 31 32 33 32 34 35 MDS can be associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The exact mechanism behind this increased risk is not fully understood, but several factors contribute to it. We propose summarizing contributing factors as two sets of ABC. The first ABC is MDS-based risk factors: (1) Abnormal blood cells: MDS involves dysfunctional blood cell production, including abnormal red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These abnormal cells can contribute to clot formation. (2) Bone marrow dysfunction: MDS affects the bone marrow, leading to ineffective hematopoiesis. This can result in abnormal blood cell components that increase the risk of clotting. (3) Cytokine dysregulation: In MDS, abnormal cytokine production can lead to inflammation and activation of the coagulation system, promoting clot formation. The second ABC is individual-dependent risk factors: (4) Age and comorbidities: MDS is more common in older adults, and age itself is a risk factor for thromboembolism. Additionally, comorbidities (such as cardiovascular disease) may further elevate the risk. (5) Blood transfusions and chemotherapy: Some MDS patients receive blood transfusions or chemotherapy, both of which can increase the risk of thromboembolism. (6) Coagulation disorder state: The combination of abnormal blood cells, inflammation, and other factors creates a hypercoagulable state, making clot formation more likely. Patients with MDS should be monitored for signs of thromboembolism, and preventive measures, such as anticoagulation therapy including direct oral anticoagulants, may be considered based on individual risk factors. A consultation with a cardio-oncologist is required. And risk-oriented treatment is essential based on a specialized guideline [ 36 7. Hemophagocytic Syndrome/Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HPS/HLH) MDS-associated HPS/HLH can occur due to hyper-inflammatory conditions. Some case reports have been published in literature reviews [ 37 38 39 40 41 However, the inflammatory nature of MDS has also been discussed, and HPS/HLH can be systemically initiated by MDS itself rather than as a reactive response, known as malignancy-associated HPS/HLH [ 42 38 40 43 8. Hemorrhage and Hematoma Formation Hemorrhagic adverse events and hematomas can be more frequently comorbid during chemotherapy in MDS [ 44 45 2 2 46 47 46 48 9. Leukemoid Reaction We do not describe the details of leukemoid reactions in patients with MDS. MDS-based leukemoid reactions can sometimes be aggressive and prominent. Leukocytosis is occasionally misdiagnosed as a transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, even by certified hematologists. This reaction can be triggered by infection, and leukocytosis typically eases after recovery from the infection. We should refer to this phenomenon as a “superleukemoid reaction” arising from underlying pathogenic MDS clones. We treated an 82-year-old woman with MDS presenting with hypercellular marrow with bicytopenia (neutropenia 980/μL and anemia Hb 7.6 g/dL) at onset, who was affected by an infection ( Figure 2 The presented case is not an uncommon situation. Rather than a special, rare presentation, it is low-risk MDS masquerading as AML with an inflammatory response and acute infection. MDS and coagulopathy are multifaceted and clinically significant. MDS is a clonal stem cell disorder that is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. This leads to cytopenias, including thrombocytopenia, which contributes directly to the risk of bleeding. This hematopoietic reaction is enhanced by cytokinemia caused by an inflammatory response, such as an infection [ 49 50 10. Differentiate Secondary Causes from Primary Causes The clinical situation mentioned above could involve multiple factors in a single individual. This means that the reasons for coagulopathy in MDS can be multifactorial. However, we can start diagnostic examination including bone marrow testing, along with treatment for infection, DIC, and TLS. Subsequently, causes can be clearly differentiated through the clinical treatment course of patients. We propose a useful flowchart for differentiating solidified fibrinolysis observed at initial MDS diagnosis ( Figure 3 Complications of infection at the onset of MDS are common, especially in MDS with neutropenia [ 26 51 25 26 The corresponding coagulopathy of a disease can be manifested in its molecular pathway. The molecular pathways associated with coagulopathy and MDS have been investigated. The mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway has been shown to play a significant role in MDS [ 52 53 SDS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder primarily caused by mutations in the SBDS gene, which plays a role in ribosome biogenesis and mitotic spindle stabilization. Hematological complications are central to its clinical presentation and the prognosis of SDS [ 54 55 Table 1 Figure 4 11. Conclusions Instead of the traditional “one-size-fits-all” model—where patients with the same diagnosis receive the same treatment—personalized medicine uses tools like laboratory data patterns, biomarker examination, and phenotypic analysis to identify what therapies are most likely to work for a specific person. For example, in cancer care, doctors might analyze a tumor’s genetic mutations to select a drug that targets those specific changes. This can lead to better outcomes, fewer side effects, and more efficient use of healthcare resources. Likewise, in the treatment of coagulopathy, discriminating the cause and detecting pathogenesis are essential to elucidate the underlying background and select the therapeutic policy. This work contributes to the advancement of personalized medicine in MDS by proposing a structured approach to distinguish between primary and secondary causes of coagulopathy and fibrinolytic abnormalities. Recognizing that patients with MDS exhibit diverse hemostatic profiles, our diagnostic flowchart supports individualized assessment and management. By integrating clinical findings with immunophenotypic and cytokine-related insights, this approach allows clinicians to tailor interventions based on the underlying mechanism of bleeding, ultimately improving patient outcomes and avoiding unnecessary or ineffective treatments. We hope that this review will assist clinicians in their clinical practice.

After the differentiation of the secondary cause of coagulopathy, primary coagulopathy with MDS is differentiated as paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS).

Figure 4 A conceptual schema of molecular mechanisms of primary and secondary coagulopathy in MDS. Primary coagulopathy in MDS is given by a genetic or intrinsic mechanism, represented by the mTOR signal pathway (left panel), while secondary coagulopathy is activated by the TLR/NF-kB pathway (right panel). (Abbreviations: MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; TLR, toll-like receptor). jpm-15-00429-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Molecular pathways in coagulopathy associated with MDS. Category Primary Coagulopathy Secondary Coagulopathy Initiating mechanism Intrinsic platelet dysfunction; dysregulated fibrinolysis linked to clonal hematopoiesis Triggered by systemic processes like infection, DIC, TLS, HPS/HLH, and bleeding Key cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-10 Signaling pathways JAK-STAT mTOR TLR/NF-κB PI3K/AKT TF pathway Paraneoplastic involvement Coagulopathy as a direct PNS manifestation, independent of systemic triggers Coagulopathy as part of broader secondary syndromes (e.g., DIC due to sepsis or bleeding) Fibrinolytic behavior Primary hyperfibrinolysis; abnormal plasmin generation Secondary fibrinolysis disturbance from hepatic dysfunction; consumptive coagulopathy Platelet Intrinsic thrombocytopathy: abnormal receptor expression, impaired aggregation Quantitative platelet loss or dysfunction due to marrow suppression or peripheral consumption Laboratory findings Normal fibrinogen ↓ Fibrinogen Therapeutic focus Modulation of intrinsic pathways: Addressing underlying disease (infection, TLS); supportive care with fresh plasma or anticoagulants if thrombotic component is present (Abbreviations: NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phoinositide 3-kinase; TF, tissue factor; TLR, toll-like receptor). ↓ decrease, ↑ increase.
