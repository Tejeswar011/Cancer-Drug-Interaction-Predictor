Several well-established blood-based inflammatory markers are commonly used to estimate systemic inflammatory burden. However, their utility in predicting treatment outcomes in ICI for HNSCC remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of the following inflammatory indices in patients with HNSCC receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy: C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the systemic immune inflammation index (SII). A total of 79 patients were included in this retrospective analysis. Optimal cutoff values were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to stratify patients into high- and low-inflammation groups. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate differences in treatment response. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed and compared using Kaplan–Meier analysis and log-rank testing, alongside both univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. Elevated CRP levels were associated with a reduced disease control rate. In univariable analysis, patients in the high-inflammation groups showed significantly worse OS and PFS for all assessed inflammatory indices. In multivariable analysis, CRP and combined positive score remained independently significant predictors of both OS and PFS, while PLR was an independent predictor of OS. These findings suggest that a high level of systemic inflammation is associated with poorer outcomes during anti-PD-1 therapy in HNSCC. Among the evaluated indices, CRP stood out as an independent and clinically useful biomarker, providing a simple, widely available tool that could potentially serve as a practical instrument for clinicians in the management of HNSCC during anti-PD-1 treatment.

Introduction Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is currently the sixth most common tumor entity worldwide and accounts for nearly 900,000 new cases and 450,000 deaths each year [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Many chronic diseases, such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer, are characterized by a state of low-grade systemic inflammation [ 7 8 9 9 10 11 2. Results 2.1. Cohort Characteristics A total of 79 patients were included in the analysis. Among them, 69 were male and 10 female, with a median age of 61 years. Of these patients, 58 were current or former smokers, and 28 had a history of high-risk alcohol consumption as defined by WHO criteria. Regarding treatment, 47 patients received pembrolizumab and 32 received nivolumab. Most patients received immune checkpoint inhibition as a first-line therapy, while 13 were treated in the second-line setting and 3 in the third-line setting. In the majority of cases, therapy was initiated due to R/M-HNSCC. Two patients not in the recurrent setting declined surgery or radiotherapy and instead received primary PD-1 inhibition. The most common indication for therapy was locoregional disease (37 cases, including the two cases treated with primary PD-1 inhibition). Additionally, 28 patients presented with distant metastases without locoregional disease, while 14 had both locoregional and distant recurrence. Combined Positive Score (CPS) values were available for 58 patients, of whom 33 had a CPS ≥ 20. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occurred in 18 cases. Median values were 1.2 mg/dl for CRP (Interquartile range [IQR], 0.5–3), 7.0 for the NLR (IQR, 4.9–12.6), 364 for the PLR (IQR, 240–515) and 1816 for the SII (IQR, 1220–3148). Patients were stratified into “Inflammation High” and “Inflammation Low” groups for each inflammation index, using optimal cut-off points determined by the Youden Index: 2.95 for CRP, 5.9 for the NLR, 376 for the PLR and 1816 for the SII. Baseline characteristics differed between the CRP Low High Supplementary Table S1 2.2. Follow-Up and Treatment Response The median follow-up time was 10 months (IQR, 5–29; range, 2–71), and the median number of treatment cycles administered was six (IQR, 5–12). Across the entire cohort, 8 patients (10%) had a complete response, 17 (21.5%) a partial response, and 7 (9%) stable disease. Progressive disease was observed in 46 patients (58%). Therefore, the overall response rate (ORR) was 31.5% and the disease control rate (DCR) was 42%. Median time to progression was 3.9 months. Each inflammatory index group was analyzed with respect to the ORR and DCR. No significant differences were observed between groups defined by the NLR, PLR, or SII. However, the disease control rate was significantly worse in the CRP High Low Table 1 2.3. Survival Analysis The predictive value of serum inflammatory markers was evaluated in relation to OS. Kaplan–Meier analyses demonstrated that patients with high levels of each inflammatory index had significantly poorer overall survival ( Figure 1 This finding was further supported by univariable Cox regression analysis, which revealed a significantly increased hazard of death among patients with high inflammatory marker levels. In contrast, a CPS > 20 was associated with a significantly reduced hazard of death. In the multivariable analysis, CPS, CRP and the PLR remained independent significant predictors of OS ( Table 2 Similarly, for PFS, Kaplan–Meier curves indicated that higher levels of all inflammatory indices except for the SII were associated with significantly poorer outcomes. In univariable Cox regression, CRP, NLR and PLR retained statistical significance with increased hazards of disease progression for patients with high inflammatory markers, whereas the SII did not. Moreover, both a CPS > 20 and the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were associated with a reduced hazard of disease progression. In the multivariable analysis, CPS and CRP remained independent significant predictors of PFS ( Table 3 3. Discussion The present study evaluated the predictive value of blood-borne inflammation markers including CRP, NLR, PLR, and SII in relation to treatment response and survival in patients with HNSCC receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Elevated levels of these inflammatory markers were associated with poorer OS and PFS. In addition, high serum CRP levels were significantly associated with a lower DCR. These findings are also consistent with previous research examining the relationship between systemic inflammation and prognosis in HNSCC patients receiving treatments other than immunotherapy. Several studies have demonstrated that elevated NLR values are associated with poorer outcomes in patients undergoing surgical therapy alone, primary chemoradiotherapy, or surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy [ 9 12 13 14 15 Recent studies have increasingly supported the role of systemic inflammation as a predictive factor in ICI therapy for HNSCC. Data from other single-center cohort studies support the finding that a high NLR is a negative predictive parameter for both progression [ 16 17 17 18 19 20 21 Emerging evidence suggests that CRP may also have a predictive role in ICI therapy for HNSCC. A high CRP level measured during treatment has been identified as an adverse predictive marker for both OS and PFS, indicating that CRP could function not only as a prognostic [ 14 22 23 24 25 Beyond baseline levels, increasing evidence suggests that CRP kinetics may also have predictive value for treatment response and survival in patients receiving ICI. In HNSCC, CRP non-responders exhibited higher rates of progressive disease and poorer OS and PFS compared to CRP responders [ 16 26 27 28 These findings align with observations in other tumor entities, where ongoing systemic inflammation has been associated with poorer outcomes during ICI therapy [ 22 29 30 31 32 The CPS serves as a potential predictive biomarker for response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in HNSCC. Here, higher CPS values are generally associated with improved response rates and overall survival [ 33 This study has several limitations. As this was a single-center retrospective analysis, the generalizability of our findings is limited, as the patient population, treatment practices, and clinical documentation may not fully reflect broader real-world settings. The relatively small sample size ( n Nevertheless, in line with existing data from both other tumor entities and HNSCC patients, our results support the association between elevated markers of systemic inflammation and poorer outcomes in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for HNSCC. Systemic inflammation is known to influence tumor progression, metastasis, recurrence, and anti-tumor immunity [ 34 35 34 36 In summary, this study demonstrates that elevated systemic inflammation is strongly associated with worse outcomes in patients with HNSCC receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, underscoring the relevance of inflammation in this setting. Among the evaluated indices, CRP consistently emerged as the most robust and independent predictor of response and survival. As there is an urgent need for reliable biomarkers to guide treatment response prediction and prognosis in HNSCC, measuring CRP provides a feasible solution. Given its availability in routine clinical practice and its low cost, CRP could potentially serve as a practical tool for clinicians in the management of HNSCC during anti-PD-1 treatment. 4. Material and Methods This retrospective single-center analysis was approved by the local ethical committee (IRB number: 2025-262-dvhd). Patients who were diagnosed with HNSCC and treated with Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab as single-agent therapy between June 2017 and August 2024 were included for analysis. Exclusion criteria were tumor combination therapy with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or other immune checkpoint inhibitors, unavailable differential blood counts, or a missing clinical or radiological target lesion. Furthermore, patients with hematological disorders or systemic corticosteroid use, which may affect differential blood counts, were excluded from analysis. Seventy-nine patients were identified for further analysis. Demographics, treatment history, site of tumor recurrence or metastasis, histopathological data, PD-L1 status, blood values, and survival data were obtained from electronic medical records. Tumor staging was based on the 8th Edition of the UICC TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors. The aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of pretreatment inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune inflammation index (SII), on treatment response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS was calculated as the time between start of PD-1 inhibition and disease progression or death from any cause. Tumor response was either assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 based on follow-up CT scans or clinically in cases of unequivocal tumor progression. OS was calculated as the time between start of PD-1 inhibition and death from any cause. Patients still responding to treatment or still alive on January the 31st 2025 were censored in the survival analysis. The Combined Positive Score (CPS) was calculated as the number of PD-L1-stained cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100. Differential blood counts were assessed on the day of anti-PD-1 treatment initiation. Systemic inflammation indices were calculated as follows: NLR (neutrophil count divided by lymphocyte count), SII (platelet count multiplied by NLR) and PLR (platelet count divided by lymphocyte count). The overall response rate was used to classify patients into responders and non-responders. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the blood inflammation indices. To identify the optimal cut-off points that maximized both sensitivity and specificity, the Youden Index was then applied. Based on these cut-off points, the cohort was then stratified into “Inflammation High” and “Inflammation Low” groups for each individual index. All survival analyses were conducted for PFS and OS. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and compared using the log-rank test.
