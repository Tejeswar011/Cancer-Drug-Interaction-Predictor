However, this association has not yet been evaluated in prospective studies. Hence, we aimed to investigate the association between the TyG index and the risk of incident CVD in patients with prediabetes. Methods Participants with prediabetes were enrolled from the Kailuan study and were followed up for clinical events until 2022. The exposure variable was TyG index. The primary outcomes were the incidence of CVD events, including ischemic heart disease and stroke, while the secondary outcomes were each specific type of CVD events. Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic spline analysis were used to calculate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and investigate exposure-response association, respectively. Results Over a mean follow-up period of 14.19 years, 13.81% ( n P Conclusions TyG index is an independent risk factor for incident CVD in the prediabetes patients.

Details of Kailuan study have been described elsewhere [ 23 24 25 Study participants Patients with prediabetes who participated in baseline examination (2006–2007) and had complete data on FBG and TG were recruited. Prediabetes was defined according to the 2024 ADA criteria as an FBG level of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L, with no use of hypoglycemic medications, based on data collected during the baseline examination (2006–2007) [ 26 Exposure and outcomes On the morning of the health examination, a fasting venous blood sample (8–12 h) of 5 ml was collected from each participant. FBG and TG levels were determined using the hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase method and the enzymatic colorimetric method, respectively, with an autoanalyzer (Hitachi Automatic Analyzer 7600, Tokyo, Japan). The TyG index was calculated as ln [fasting TG (mg/dL) × FBG (mg/dL)/2] based on data collected during the baseline examination (2006–2007) [ 27 The primary outcome of this analysis was the incidence of CVD events, a composite of ischemic heart disease and stroke, with each outcome further analyzed separately as secondary outcomes. Stroke included both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke; hemorrhagic stroke encompassed subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage. Ischemic heart disease included myocardial infarction and revascularization therapy. Revascularization therapies consisted of procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Myocardial infarction and stroke were identified by ICD-10 codes, CABG and PCI were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes [ 28 Data collection Demographic data (e.g., age and sex), socioeconomic status (e.g., education), lifestyle information (e.g., drinking status, smoking status, and physical activity), medication use (e.g., antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, and lipid-lowering drugs), family history (e.g., CVD) and medical history (e.g., cancer, heart failure, and CVD) were obtained through face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire. The detailed measurement procedures have been described previously [ 25 2 29 30 During the health examination, blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein after a fasting period of at least 8 h overnight. Biochemical parameters, including TG, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and FBG levels, were measured using an autoanalyzer (Hitachi Automatic Analyzer 7600, Tokyo, Japan). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were assessed with an autoanalyzer (Cias Latex CRP-H, Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics were described as the mean (SD), median with IQR, or number and percentage (%), as appropriate. Intergroup comparisons across TyG index quartiles were conducted by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVAs) or Kruskal–Wallis tests for continuous variables and χ [ 2 Unadjusted incidence rates (per 1,000 person-years) and Kaplan‒Meier curves were used to present the absolute risk of CVD events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of incident CVD associated with the TyG index, both as a continuous variable and in quartile categories. Model 1 was adjusted for age (continuous variable, years) and sex (men or women). Model 2 adjusted for variables in model 1 and current smoking (yes or no), current drinking (yes or no), physical activity (active or inactive), education (high school completion and lower or college completion and higher), snoring (never or ever) and CVD family history (yes or no). Model 3 adjusted for variables in model 2 and BMI (continuous variable, kg/m 2 Subgroup analyses We performed subgroup analyses to investigate the association between the TyG index and CVD events in different subgroups. Patients with prediabetes were classified based on the following characteristics: age (< 45, 45–60, and ≥ 60 years), sex (men and women), current smoking (no and yes), current drinking (no and yes), snoring (never and ever), BMI (< 24 kg/m 2 2 2 Sensitivity analyses To assess the robustness of the association between TyG index and CVD in patients with prediabetes, several sensitivity analyses were performed. To begin with, to address potential reverse causation, we excluded participants who experienced incident CVD within the first year of follow-up. Second, to minimize the impact of drugs on our findings, we excluded participants who were using antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs at baseline. Third, we assessed the impact of multiple imputation on results by re-analyzing the model using the complete dataset without imputation. Fourth, to account for the potential impact of unmeasured confounders, we determined the E-value needed to quantify their potential effect on the results using the adjusted Model 3 [ 31 Prediction model To evaluate the predictive performance of TyG index for CVD, the C-index, Net Reclassification Index (NRI) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement Index (IDI) of the Prediction Model for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk in China (China-PAR model), China-PAR model plus TG, China-PAR model plus FBG and China-PAR model plus TyG index were calculated to compare the predictive performance of different indicators for CVD. Secondary outcome analyses Cox proportional hazards models were applied to evaluate the associations between the TyG index and the risk of incident ischemic heart disease, stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke, with adjustments for the same covariates as previously described. In addition, restricted cubic splines were employed to further investigate potential dose-response association. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R software (version 4.1.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

For the stratified analyses, the stratification factor was not included in the model Sensitivity analyses A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the association between TyG index levels and CVD risk in prediabetes patients. The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings. Furthermore, based on Model 3, we calculated the E-Value for the association between the fourth quartile of the TyG index and CVD, which was 2.26. This suggests that any confounding factor associated with CVD would need to have a HR of at least 2.26 to reduce the observed HR for CVD events to below 1. Meanwhile, the competing risks analysis using the Fine–Gray model showed a trend similar to that of the original analysis (Supplemental Table 1). Prediction model The addition of TyG index to the China-PAR model in the overall population resulted in a higher predictive performance for the risk of CVD compared with the addition of TG or FBG. The C-index for predicting the occurrence of CVD was 68.1%, which was a 0.4% improvement compared with the China-PAR model alone (C-index = 67.7%). The continuous NRI was 0.102 (95% CI 0.076–0.128) and the IDI was 0.001 (95% CI 0.001–0.003) (Supplemental Table 2). Secondary outcomes During the follow-up period, there were 893 incident cases of ischemic heart disease, 1,755 cases of stroke, 1,548 cases of ischemic stroke, and 281 cases of hemorrhagic stroke. A higher TyG index was significantly associated with increased risks of ischemic heart disease (HR per 1-unit increase: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.16–1.32), stroke (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03–1.13), and ischemic stroke (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.05–1.16), but not with hemorrhagic stroke (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.87–1.09) among prediabetic patients (Table 2 3 Discussion Principal findings In this large, community-based, prospective cohort study, we demonstrated that a higher TyG index, either as a continuous or categorical variable, was significantly associated with an increased risk of CVD among patients with prediabetes, particularly for ischemic heart disease. The association between the TyG index and CVD risk in prediabetic patients was consistent across subgroups by age, sex, BMI, smoking, drinking, and snoring status. The association was stronger in women, older adults, those with obesity, lower systemic inflammation (hs-CRP ≤ 3 mg/L), and non-smokers, non-drinkers, and non-snorers. The estimated PAR further suggested that 7.04% of incident CVD events could have been avoided if all prediabetes participants had maintained a low TyG index. In addition, the TyG index significantly improved risk prediction when added to conventional models, supporting its potential clinical utility. Comparison with other studies Observational prospective studies on the associations between TyG index and CVD risk among patients with prediabetes are lacking; therefore, no direct comparison was possible. Previous cross-sectional research by Liu et al. found an OR of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.20–2.25) for CVD associated with each one-point increase in the TyG index, among 4,340 prediabetic or diabetic patients younger than 65 years [ 22 34 The TyG index is more strongly associated with ischemic heart disease than with stroke in those with prediabetes. Our results were broadly similar to those reported in the general population [ 18 35 36 In a study on the general population, Hong et al. discovered that the TyG index levels were more strongly associated with CVD risk in men, patients under the age of 65, and alcohol drinkers [ 36 37 38 39 Potential mechanisms The mechanism by which TyG indices are associated with increased CVD remains unclear. However, insulin resistance may hold a key position between the association of TyG with CVD. Insulin resistance, a pathophysiological condition, diminishes cellular responsiveness to insulin, thereby initiating hyperglycemia [ 40 41 43 15 44 46 47 48 49 50 Strengths and limitations Strengths of this study include its prospective design, long-term follow-up, a large-scale cohort of patients with prediabetes, and the use of multiple sensitivity analyses to verify the stability of the results. Moreover, the entire study population was covered by the Municipal Social Insurance Institution, hospital discharge registers, and biennial medical examinations, which enabled us to track outcome events for all participants. Despite these strengths, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the present study. First, the diagnosis of prediabetes was determined based on a single FBG measurement [ 51 52 Conclusions In summary, a higher TyG index was independently associated with a 45% increased risk of overall cardiovascular disease, a 97% increased risk of ischemic heart disease, and a 26% increased risk of stroke among patients with prediabetes. These findings hold significant public health and clinical implications, given the widespread prevalence of prediabetes and the elevated cardiovascular risk in this population.
