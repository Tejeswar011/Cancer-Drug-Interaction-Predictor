Currently, its pathogenesis remain incompletely understood, and while diverse treatments are available, these have suboptimal efficacy. Herein, we analyzed the relevant genes and pathways in HS using bioinformatics to provide directions for the development of novel treatment. Methods Two HS datasets were obtained, and differentially expressed genes associated with HS were identified. Enrichment analysis was performed, and a protein–protein interaction network of differential genes was produced. Genes were analyzed using the CytoHubba plugin to obtain the hub genes. For validation, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes between the affected skin tissues of patients with HS and normal human skin tissues. Results Overall, 180 differential genes associated with HS were identified. Differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in leukocyte migration, serine hydrolase activity, and serine-type peptidase activity. In total, 69 transcription factors, 115 microRNAs, and 41 drugs associated with hub genes were identified. The expression of FCGR2A IL2RG Conclusion Ten hub genes were identified.

This recommendation was based on consistent and high-quality patient-oriented evidence. 10 11 10 Bioinformatic analysis, which has been widely used in the study of multiple diseases, 12 13 To gain further insight into the pathogenesis of HS, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of the disease with the aim of identifying disease-associated genes and their corresponding pathways, using cytoHubba plugin and MCODE plugin. The diagnostic significance of hub genes was analyzed, and the network relationships between mRNAs and TFs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, as well as genes and drugs were predicted. Furthermore, we analyzed the immune-infiltrating cells associated with HS and examined the expression levels of relevant genes in the skin tissues of patients and healthy controls. Our findings might contribute to a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of HS by highlighting specific implicated genes and pathways. Methods Data Acquisition and Processing We obtained the GSE137141 GSE148027 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ 14 15 GSE137141 GPL16699 GSE148027 GPL570 16 Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) We used the “limma” package to perform a differential gene expression analysis of the control and HS groups in the GSE137141 GSE148027 GO and KEGG Enrichment Analyses The GO knowledge base ( https://www.geneontology.org/ 17 https://www.kegg.jp 18 PPI Network The STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org/ 19 20 21 Identification of Hub Genes and Protein Modules CytoHubba, 22 Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) Values ROC curves 23 mRNA–miRNA and mRNA–TF Networks Next, a prediction of the target miRNAs and TFs of the identified hub genes was conducted. miRNAs were predicted using the miRDB 24 25 Target Gene–Drug Networks The Drug–Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb), 26 Analysis of Immune Cell Infiltration The R package “CIBERSORT” 27 Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) From 1 July 2023 to 1 July 2024, we collected 10 healthy control samples and 10 HS patient lesional biopsies from hospital. All samples were from East Asians aged 18 to 60. Specifically, the samples pertaining to patients with HS were collected from individuals who had been clinically diagnosed with the condition and exhibited disease severity classified as levels II to III. The experimental protocol received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Zhangjiagang Hospital of Soochow University on 1 July 2023. All participants provided informed consent prior to the study. We collected and preserved skin samples using containers filled with formalin and extracted total RNA from the samples. Reverse transcription was performed using the Applied Biosystems 2720 thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to perform quantitative PCR using MonScript™ ChemoHS qPCR Mix (Monad, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. GAPDH was used as an internal reference for data standardization. Relative expression level was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method.

( a b c d e f g h i j Discussion In the research, we utilized available bioinformatics analysis tools to explore the pathogenesis of HS at the molecular level and thus predict potentially effective therapeutic agents. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs in HS highlighted the regulation of leukocyte migration and differentiation, serine-type endopeptidase and serine hydrolase activity, as well as interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, cell adhesion molecules, and primary immunodeficiency as implicated in the disease. HS is a chronic purulent inflammation of the apocrine sweat glands, commonly found in friction areas, such as the axilla, groin, and perianal area. Its clinical manifestations include painful inflammatory nodules, acne, scarring, and sinus tracts. In addition, HS can have serious consequences such as psychological and social disorders, activity limitations, and even skin cancer. The exact mechanism of HS pathogenesis is not well understood, and its treatment in the clinic is not universally effective. Current research has established that HS is a persistent inflammatory disorder, and many pro-inflammatory mediators, including interferon-γ, TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-1, play major roles in its pathogenesis. The role of serine proteases is to cleave peptide bonds, thus degrading large proteins into small proteins. As described by İlgen et al, autoinflammatory syndromes such as HS are associated with mutations in a gene called proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein. 29 30 The IL-17 signaling pathway has been well described in the pathogenesis of HS. The IL-17 family, which includes six members (IL-17A to IL-17F), 31 32 33 34 33 35 36 37 Currently, the treatment of inflammatory diseases has evolved from general immunosuppression to biological agents that target the IL-23/IL-17 signaling pathway. 38 SELL ITGAL 39 40 In the PPI network, we filtered out 10 hub genes (PTPRC, CD19, IL7R, SELL, ITGAL, CD27, ITGAX, FCGR2A, CD2, IL2RG) and three protein modules. All 10 hub genes were presented in the core protein modules. The protein modules further demonstrate the significance of the hub gene, and also suggest that genes such as CCR5, CXCR4, THY1, CCR7 and KLRB1 are closely related to the hub genes. CCR5, as a member of the G protein-coupled receptor protein family, can facilitate communication between immune cells and the environment, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses. 41 42 43 44 45 46–48 Of the 10 aforementioned hub genes, IL2RG FCGR2A FCGR2A IL2RG FCGR2A FCGR2A FCGR2A 49 IL2RG mTOR 50 51 Studies have shown that IL2RG can mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, and other signal transduction by participating in various pathways, such as JAK/STAT, essential for the development, differentiation, and function of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. 52 IL2RG IL2RG IL2RG Among the predicted hub genes, CD19 ITGAL 53 54 CD19 ITGAL 55 56 57 58 59 CD19, SELL ITGAX ITGAX 60 61 62 61 PTPRC 63 64 65 PTPRC A series of analyses of the hub genes were carried out. First, ROC curves were used to assess the diagnostic significance of genes. The mRNA–TF and mRNA–miRNA interactions of hub genes were predicted, highlighting the regulatory networks in hub gene transcription. Further, the relationship between genes and drugs was predicted. Our mRNA–TF network contains nine hub gene mRNAs and 69 TFs. Among them, GATA3 is a transcription factor for IL7R, ITGAL IL2RG IL7R 66 ITGAX, IL7R, IL2RG CD27 67 68 69 70 71 MiRNAs play a role in cellular responses and are particularly important in inflammatory regulation and autoimmune diseases. 72 73 74 75 76 77 7 78 79 80 81 In the predicted gene–drug interaction network, prednisone, 82 83 84 Efalizumab was used in a trial to treat HS; however, efficacy was not achieved. 85 86 87 88 The following drugs are not used in HS treatment based on the available literature: hydrocortisone butyrate, clobetasol propionate, estradiol valerate, alendronate sodium, hydrogen peroxide, daclizumab, denileukin diftitox (DD), basiliximab, aldesleukin, sirolimus (use of this drug may induce HS), 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97–100 101 102 103 104 105 We used the “CIBERSORT” package to evaluate immune cell infiltration in patients with HS. M1 macrophages are closely associated with regulatory and activated memory CD4 T cells. Neutrophils are closely associated with resting mast cells, regulatory T cells, and activated mast cells. Resting mast cells are closely associated with follicular helper T cells and plasma cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations require further in-depth investigation. Finally, we examined the expression levels of 10 hub genes in HS using qRT-PCR. FCGR2A IL2RG This study has some limitations. First, the sample size was small, which might have affected the credibility of the data. Second, sex differences are obvious in HS but were not considered in the current study. The proportion of men and women in the dataset sample was not balanced, as all samples in GSE137141 Conclusion Our bioinformatics analysis led to the identification of 10 hub genes, with roles in signaling pathways. We also identified potential drugs and analyzed their association with immune-infiltrating cells.
