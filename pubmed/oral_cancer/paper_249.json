While analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used, though effective, they have gastrointestinal side effects. Green tea, with its anti-inflammatory properties, could offer a novel approach for pain relief. This study evaluates the effectiveness of green tea extract in managing postoperative pain following orthodontic premolar extractions in children and adolescents. Method This split-mouth, randomized, double-blind trial involved 44 children aged 12–17 requiring orthodontic extractions. Green tea extract was prepared, and each participant underwent two surgeries, with green tea extract applied to one site and saline as a placebo to the other. Assessment of pain was done using the Visual Analog Scale at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. Results A study of 44 patients (mean age: 14.82 years) compared pain relief after tooth extraction. Green tea extract significantly reduced pain and analgesic use compared to saline, with lower pain scores at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours ( p p Conclusion Green tea-infused gauze, when applied near the extraction site, is effective in pain management. Clinical significance The study demonstrates that green tea extract is effective in managing postoperative pain following pediatric dental extractions. Its application significantly reduced pain intensity and the need for analgesics compared to a saline placebo. This suggests green tea extract is a promising, natural alternative for pain relief, offering benefits without the gastrointestinal side effects associated with NSAIDs.

Despite its prevalence, there exists a discernible deficit in scholarly comprehension regarding the pain perception in children and adolescents undergoing this process, both during and in the postoperative phase. 1 2 3 4 4 5 7 The significance of preventing pain extends beyond its immediate benefit to the patient, as pain plays a substantial role in the development of dental fear and anxiety (DFA) and behavioral management issues, particularly in the context of children and adolescents. 8 8 A variety of drugs, encompassing both opioids and non-opioids, have been employed in the management of pain. These medications can be administered through diverse routes, including oral, transdermal, neuraxial, intravenous (IV), and regional methods. Ibuprofen is typically recognized as the model for this sizable class of synthetic chemicals distinguished by their potency as analgesics, antipyretics, and anti-inflammatory agents. Their capacity to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) necessary for the synthesis of several types of prostanoids accounts for the majority of these therapeutic actions and their most recognized adverse effects. 9 The clinical usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is based on their capacity to lower prostaglandin production, which is associated with pain, fever, and inflammation. In addition to inhibiting the formation of additional prostanoids that carry out beneficial physiological functions, these drugs tend to be unable to discriminate in their pursuit of this purpose. This takes into account potential negative consequences and restrictions. The NSAIDs' gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is one of their most common negative effects. Prostaglandins induce the mucous membrane that guards the stomach and small intestine. NSAIDs prevent the synthesis of these specific prostaglandins, which causes the erosive and ulcerative adverse effects that are common with NSAIDs. This activity takes place both locally, when an oral medication comes into touch with the gastric mucosa, and systemically, when it is absorbed and distributed to the GI mucosa. 10 Tea, 11 Camellia sinensis 12 13 14 In addition to other symptoms, including edema, erythema, warmth, and functional impairment, one of the main hallmarks of inflammation is pain, and it is particularly important in the diagnosis of infection. To reduce the risk of surgical site infections, green tea mouthwash has shown antibacterial properties, particularly in preventing microorganisms from adhering to suturing materials. 15 16 MATERIALS AND METHODS Trial Design and Ethical Considerations The present study was designed as a split-mouth, randomized controlled, double-blind investigation and was conducted on children referred to the Department of Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry. The study design was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals [IHEC/SDC/PEDO-2201/23/016] prior to the start of the study and is also registered in CTRI (CTRI/2024/07/071371). Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Children aged 12–17 years, indicated for orthodontic extractions of contralateral maxillary or mandibular premolars, were selected for the study. Exclusion criteria included children with systemic disorders, maxillofacial pain (e.g., temporomandibular disorder or pulpitis), radiographic lesions, allergies to green tea products, or recent use of analgesics, antibiotics, or herbal medications within the past month. Sample Size Calculation and Informed Consent The sample size (88 samples in 44 patients) was calculated using the formula for comparing two means, targeting a minimum 0.7 difference in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores and the average number of analgesics used. With an α error of 0.05 and 1 − β = 0.95, the calculation was performed using G*Power 3.1.9.2 software. 17 Preparation of the Green Tea Extract Indian Himalayan green tea was purchased from the Dunham company (India) for the study. To prepare the hydroalcoholic extract, 50 gm of green tea powder was macerated with 150 mL of 70% ethanol for 72 hours ( Fig. 1 Figs 2 3 Fig. 1: Extract Fig. 2: Extraction of green tea Fig. 3: Extract of green tea Clinical Procedure Each participant underwent two minor surgical procedures. Using a coin toss, the right and left teeth were randomly assigned to the study or control group. Personal details, such as gender, age, and the parents' contact information, were recorded. Any known or suspected sensitivity to green tea products was also documented. All extractions were performed by an experienced surgeon following a standardized protocol. Topical anesthesia was applied at the injection site, followed by local anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine. Maxillary or mandibular infiltration and nerve blocks were administered as needed for the procedure. A periosteal flap was then reflected using a periosteal elevator, and the tooth was extracted using the required forceps. Following the removal of the tooth, socket irrigation was done with 60 mL of saline. According to the predetermined randomization, during the first surgery (study group), sterile gauze soaked in green tea extract was applied to the extraction site, while saline-impregnated gauze was used as a placebo during the second surgery (control group). The procedures were spaced 2 weeks apart, and both the children and the clinician were blinded to the type of gauze used. The patient's parents were advised against giving any painkillers after the procedure. At the end of the extraction, they received paracetamol 325 mg tablets for intolerable pain and were instructed to call immediately if needed. Participants were contacted via phone at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours postsurgery to assess discomfort levels at the extraction site using the VAS, which is known for its accuracy and reliability in evaluating pain after orthodontic extractions. 17 The researchers assessed the participants on the third day after surgery to identify any signs of dry socket. Children taking other medications for health conditions during the study were excluded. Pain reduction, measured by the decrease in VAS pain scores and the number of analgesics used, was determined by comparing the green tea group with the control group. Statistical Analysis The data were initially entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and subsequently analyzed using SPSS version 25. The Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were employed to assess the normality of the data. Comparisons between the two groups were conducted through the Mann–Whitney U p RESULTS A total of 44 patients met the inclusion criteria: 18 boys (40.9%) and 26 girls (59.1%). The mean age of the participants was 14.82 ± 2.5 years.

They offer a holistic approach to pain relief, with a history of safe use in traditional medicine, and align with the growing preference for natural and sustainable treatments. In a study done by Rathi et al., the efficacy of neem and turmeric in wound healing within orthodontic extraction sockets was explored, motivated by the perceived safety and lower side effects of herbal medicines compared to traditional medications. Notably, rapid wound healing was observed in the groups receiving neem and turmeric extracts when compared to the control. The findings suggest that herbal extract therapy, specifically neem and turmeric, holds potential for promoting improved wound healing in orthodontic extraction sockets. However, the recommendation is tempered by the acknowledgment that a larger sample size is needed for a more comprehensive understanding. 18 The present study demonstrated that applying green tea extract locally at the orthodontic extraction site positively influenced pain perception, significantly reducing both the intensity of pain and the number of painkillers needed after the extraction of teeth for orthodontic purposes. A double-blind randomized controlled trial with a split-mouth design conducted by Etemadi Sh et al. in 2023, addressing the postoperative pain following the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars, showed that the application of sterile gauze impregnated with green tea extract led to a significant reduction in VAS scores and the number of analgesics consumed within the first 2 days after surgery. The findings suggest that green tea extract could serve as a suitable and safe option for postoperative pain control in such cases. 19 In a cross-sectional observational study, Wahidujjaman et al. investigated the effectiveness of green tea and chlorhexidine mouth rinses in mitigating post-extraction complications like pain and bleeding. The green tea group showed significantly lower VAS scores, shorter hemostasis time, and reduced analgesic use compared to the chlorhexidine group. These results align with the current study, where applying sterile gauze soaked in green tea extract to the extraction site also led to significantly lower VAS scores compared to the control group. This suggests that green tea could be a valuable therapeutic option for managing postextraction pain and bleeding. 20 Moghadam et al. conducted a randomized crossover controlled study involving 45 patients aged 25 to 50, evaluating pain after pocket reduction surgery. They found that the Pain Rating Scale significantly decreased after the first day of using green tea and aloe vera mouth rinse for 10 days. 21 Our study demonstrated notable strengths and limitations, particularly when working with pediatric patients. The lack of standardization in the green tea extract's active compound concentration is the limitation of the present study, which can impact the reproducibility. However, the split-mouth, self-controlled design effectively reduced the influence of variables such as age and gender. We also standardized surgical factors such as difficulty, duration, and surgeon expertise by ensuring that one experienced surgeon performed all procedures. To address concerns about the potential for insufficient pain relief from green tea extract alone, we provided clear postoperative instructions to lower the risk of excessive bleeding and reduce the chances of dry socket in pediatric patients. CONCLUSION The outcomes of the investigation indicate that the utilization of gauze infused with green tea is both efficient and safe in managing postoperative pain following extraction. It leads to a noteworthy reduction in the average quantity of painkillers administered to pediatric patients undergoing surgical extraction of teeth for orthodontic purposes. Clinical Significance The study highlights the clinical significance of green tea extract in managing postoperative pain following pediatric dental extractions. Green tea extract was shown to significantly reduce pain levels compared to saline, with lower pain scores observed at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours ( p p ORCID Ayushma Chakravorty https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6013-8560 Lavanya Govindaraju https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0249-5513 Source of support: Conflict of interest: REFERENCES 1.
