Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects various systems and is characterized by a complex pathophysiology and variable clinical manifestations. The development of SLE is the result of intricate interactions among sociodemographic, genetic, epigenetic, molecular, immunological, and hormonal factors. These interactions trigger the production of autoantibodies that cause tissue damage in various organs due to the activation of numerous pro-inflammatory pathways [ 1 2 3 A common and serious complication of SLE that necessitates careful evaluation is kidney damage. Renal involvement in SLE is an immunoglobulin complex disease. Early detection of signs of renal failure in patients with SLE through appropriate diagnostic tests, such as renal biopsy and imaging, aims to maintain renal function and stop evolution to end-stage renal disease [ 4 5 6 7 8 3 9 10 Among the various organs affected by SLE, the skin is the second most commonly involved, with about 80% of patients experiencing skin manifestations during the disease progression [ 1 1 8 11 11 1 Identifying specific biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, or treatment in patients with SLE can be a challenging task. Recent reports indicate that renal injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and Beta-2 microglobulin (β2MG), both involved in the development of systemic autoimmunity, may play a significant role in managing SLE patients, who are at a higher risk of tissue damage in multiple organs. The correlation of KIM-1 and β2MG with the clinical activity of SLE, along with their detectable levels in urine and plasma, underscores the potential clinical utility of these biological factors [ 12 13 14 15 16 KIM-1/TIM-1 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in various tissues, and its expression is rapidly induced at both the gene and protein levels. In healthy kidneys, KIM-1 expression is low, but it becomes significantly elevated in renal lesions of various etiologies [ 17 13 17 13 17 12 18 12 19 β2MG is a low molecular-weight protein that shares sequence homology with immunoglobulins. It acts as a component of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and has been recognized as a regulator of inflammation, as well as a potential modulator of the immune response and systemic autoimmunity [ 20 21 22 23 10 24 1 9 25 26 23 Currently, there is limited data on the relationship between KIM-1 and β2MG, along with the clinical and biological characteristics of patients with SLE. This study aims to evaluate the potential relationship between serum and urinary levels of KIM-1 and β2MG and (a) disease activity, and (b) the development of tissue lesions (including renal damage, hematological abnormalities, and skin lesions) in SLE patients. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design The present study is a case-control study performed between 2021 and 2025 in the Clinical Hospital of Nephrology, “Dr Carol Davila”, Bucharest, Romania. The subjects included in the study were divided into two groups: the SLE group that included 80 SLE patients with hematological, cutaneous–mucosal, and renal determinations and the control group with 30 healthy subjects. All the subjects were included in the study, after signing the informed consent statement; the Declaration of Helsinki from 1975 was respected. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Clinical Hospital of Nephrology, “Carol Davila” (26/25 October 2021). SLE diagnosis was based on immunological determinations and renal biopsy, according to Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology criteria. All the subjects with active urinary sediment underwent renal biopsy, with evaluation in optical and electronic microscopy and immunofluorescence, according to KDIGO guidelines. SLE disease activity was evaluated by the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). The study included SLE subjects who had chronic kidney disease at stages 1 or 2, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 The exclusion criteria comprised the following: individuals under 18 years of age, pregnant women, tobacco users, those taking vitamins or antioxidants, and patients with stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease. Additionally, individuals with any cardiovascular, hepatic, thyroid, gastrointestinal, or oncological diseases, as well as those who had experienced any viral or bacterial infections in the previous three months, were excluded from the study. 2.2. Clinical and Biological Characteristics of the Studied Groups The SLE group included 46 women with a mean age of 45 ± 12 years and 34 men with a mean age of 49 ± 17 years. The control group included 15 women with a mean age of 41 ± 9 years and 15 men with a mean age of 44 ± 21 years. The SLE group comprised 48 subjects presenting with cutaneous and hematological manifestations but without lupus nephritis, and 32 subjects diagnosed with lupus nephritis. The classic biomarkers of lupus activity that were evaluated were antinuclear antibodies, anti dsDNA antibodies, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR), and complement components C3 and C4. dsDNA had significantly high values in subjects with lupus nephritis compared with SLE subjects with hematological and cutaneous–mucosal determination and the control group. The complement proteins had high levels in SLE groups compared to the control group. Leucocytes and hemoglobin were statistically significantly lower in SLE groups compared with the control group. 2.3. Laboratory Tests After signing the informed consent statement, each subject included in the study underwent blood sampling after a 12 h fasting period, using a holder–vacutainer system and the urine samples were collected from the first urine in the morning. We determined the serum and urinary levels of KIM by ELISA method (Serum and urinary KIM-1-Reactivity-Human, ELISA kit-Elabscience, Catalog number-E-EL-H6029; TECAN analyzer-GmbH, Grodig, Austria). Serum β2MG was quantified from peripheral venous blood collected a jeun, along with urinary β2MG, using an immunoturbidimetric assay that employed a latex-bound rabbit anti-β2MG polyclonal antibody. The Beta-2 Microglobulin Protein Kit, Human (HEK293, His), and HumaStar300 analyzer (Weisbaden, Germany) were utilized. 2.4. Statistical Analysis The data are presented as means and standard deviations. The comparison tests employed include Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test, or the Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test, depending on whether the data are normally or non-normally distributed. To assess the relationship between the studied parameters (KIM-1 and β2MG) and eGFR, SLEDAI, and various clinical features of SLE, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used. Prior to evaluating these relationships, data normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. A significance level ( p 3. Results Serum and urinary levels of KIM-1 (ng/dL serum, ng/mL urine) and β2MG (ng/dL serum, mg/L urine) were significantly different between SLE patients and controls ( Table 1 The serum and urinary values of KIM-1 (ng/dL serum, ng/mL urine) and β2MG (ng/dL serum, mg/L urine) in patients with SLE were significantly different according to the values of eGFR ( Table 2 Table 3 The KIM-1 and β2MG variations in patients with SLE were inconsistently affected by SLEDAI levels. Serum β2MG levels were significantly associated with SLE activity ( Table 4 sKIM-1 and uKIM-1, in patients with SLE, were not influenced by the presence of skin determinations. It is interesting to note that sβ2MG levels vary significantly in patients with mucocutaneous findings (ulcers, lesions of the oral mucosa, and alopecia) ( Table 5 KIM-1 and β2MG levels in patients with SLE vary moderately in the presence of hematological disorders, such as anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia ( Table 6 Table 6 An analysis of the relationships between serum and urinary levels of KIM-1 and β2MG, as well as clinical features and biological data of SLE patients, is summarized in Table 6 Serum KIM-1 levels are also strongly positively correlated with high levels of albuminuria and are independent of eGFR and SLEDAI. A positive correlation was found between serum and urinary KIM-1 values. For β2MG, both serum and urinary levels were associated with increased albuminuria and markers of inflammation; however, only urinary β2MG correlated with lower eGFR and active urinary sediment. Serum β2MG levels show a significant positive correlation with SLEDAI scores and the presence of mucocutaneous manifestations (such as ulcers, lesions of the oral mucosa, and alopecia) and vary moderately with hematological abnormalities (including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia). A statistically significant positive correlation was also identified between serum and urinary β2MG levels ( Figure 1 Figure 2 4. Discussion The findings from this study reinforce the role of KIM-1 and β2MG as important markers in the early diagnosis, disease progression, and understanding of the pathogenic basis of SLE. Through a systematic quantitative evaluation of KIM-1 and β2MG levels in both urine and blood samples, we compared a representative group of SLE patients with control subjects and obtained the following conclusions (see Table 7 (a) The elevated levels of KIM-1 and β2MG in patients with SLE compared to controls suggest that these biomarkers play a significant role in the pathophysiology of SLE. The measurement of KIM-1 and β2MG could serve as a molecular prognostic model for individuals diagnosed with SLE. (b) Both serum and urinary levels of KIM-1 and β2MG are associated with the clinical and biological manifestations of SLE. (c) KIM-1 is a marker that defines the renal phenotype in SLE patients. (d) β2MG reflects the progression of cumulative lesions in individuals with SLE. (e) Serum β2MG levels can distinguish between patients with renal lesions and those without renal lesions. Our findings align with other published research regarding the pathophysiological roles of KIM-1 and β2MG in patients with SLE. By comparing the urinary and serum levels of these two parameters with those of a control group, we have demonstrated the significance of KIM-1 and β2MG in SLE pathogenesis. Variations in the levels of KIM-1 and β2MG in SLE patients correlate with the severity of the disease, the presence of tissue lesions (including renal, hematological, and cutaneous lesions), and the extent of inflammation. Several studies highlight the pathophysiological role of KIM-1 in various kidney disorders. Significantly higher levels of KIM-1 have been detected in patients with acute ischemia, toxic kidney injury, renal cell carcinoma, chronic kidney disease, and lupus nephritis [ 19 19 32 The upregulation of KIM-1 in SLE may be attributed to accelerated proteolytic cleavage of the KIM-1 ectodomain in renal lesions [ 2 29 33 28 29 13 34 17 Consistent with a significant body of the published literature, our results indicate that β2-MG levels are considerably higher in SLE patients than in controls. The levels of β2-MG progressively increase with the development of lesions in multiple organs and tissues. A recent meta-analysis that included 16 studies with 1368 SLE patients and 423 controls revealed persistent overexpression of β2-MG in SLE patients. The analysis found a strong correlation between β2-MG levels and disease activity and noted a significant reduction in β2-MG levels in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment [ 10 15 10 15 In recent years, numerous studies have highlighted the significant biological roles of β2MG in tumor immunity. Research suggests that a deficiency in the β2MG gene may inhibit the presentation of MHC class I molecules, thereby promoting immune evasion in melanoma [ 23 24 23 Additionally, this research has provided valuable insights for nephrology and dermatology, particularly regarding the potential pathogenic role of KIM-1 in kidney injury and disease, and has also highlighted the relevance of β2MG in chronic lesions in patients with SLE. KIM-1 levels show a relationship with eGFR values and the pathological characteristics of urinary sediment, such as leukocyturia, hematuria, and cylindruria. This relationship is attributed to the ability of KIM-1 to regulate the adaptive responses of the renal epithelium to ischemic lesions and toxins [ 30 Our study also indicated that β2MG is correlated with mucocutaneous damage in SLE. Circulating levels of β2MG were significantly higher in SLE patients with cutaneous and mucosal lesions (such as alopecia and oral ulcers) compared to those without skin involvement. Serum β2MG levels can distinguish between SLE patients with and without skin manifestations. An experimental study on mice with SLE and high levels of β2MG revealed an increased number of mice exhibiting skin symptoms, while fewer showed kidney damage [ 15 10 25 29 16 29 35 20 In autoimmune disorders, the role of lipid rafts in LRP signaling, which is triggered by autoantibodies in endothelial cells, has been discussed. In SLE, autoantibodies induce the expression of tissue factors in endothelial cells through the LRP signal transduction pathway. This autoantibody-mediated signaling is facilitated by lipid rafts, which are microdomains of the plasma membrane enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol. Similar lipid raft-dependent processes may also be significant for the physiological role of β2MG in cell signaling and vascular pathogenesis. The results of our study provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SLE [ 36 Recent research demonstrates a positive relationship between serum β2MG levels and the cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of SLE, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and IFN-α [ 10 31 KIM-1 regulates the inflammatory response by interacting with p85, PI3K, NF-κB, and STAT3/ERK1/2. It facilitates the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, thereby protecting the kidney by acting as an inhibitor of innate immune response and inflammation [ 27 28 The evaluation of the biomarkers KIM-1 and β2MG, both in serum and urine, is a significant aspect of the study. The findings indicate that KIM-1 is primarily specific to the kidneys, while β2MG reflects both renal and systemic diseases. These biomarkers can be detected through non-invasive tests using urine and serum, and they may indicate changes at the cellular or molecular level. Although β2MG and KIM-1 are not sufficient for diagnosing SLE, they can be valuable in suggesting the presence, development, and progression of this systemic disease. Ultimately, additional studies are needed to explore the relationship between variations in these biomarkers and the response to treatment. By rigorously monitoring these two parameters, future research should validate the potential of these non-invasive biological factors for use in the diagnosis, clinical prognosis, and guidance of therapeutic strategies in patients with SLE. 5. Conclusions This study provides compelling evidence that, in patients diagnosed with SLE, KIM-1 may play a role in kidney injury and disease, while β2MG could be involved in both kidney and non-kidney diseases. In conclusion, these biomarkers correlate with organ involvement and disease activity; however, their mechanistic contribution remains to be established.

Role of KIM-1 and β2MG in SLE KIM-1 Profile β2MG Profile Potential Mechanisms Pathogenesis Serum levels of KIM-1 show significant increase in SLE ( Table 1 β2MG is elevated in the serum of patients with SLE. The KIM-1 upregulation in SLE would be explained by the accelerated proteolytic cleavage of the KIM-1 ectodomain in the early stage of the renal disease [ 27 28 10 15 Skin and/or mucosal lesions Invariable serum KIM-1 values in patients with SLE with preserved renal function and cutaneous determinations. Serum β2MG levels are high in patients with SLE and skin complications. β2MG has a potential pathogenic element in non-renal diseases. β2MG and MHC-I/HLA-I orchestrate mucosal immunity, production of immunosuppressive molecules, and melanocyte stimulating hormone activity [ 16 20 29 Development of renal manifestations KIM-1 levels increase with worsening proteinuria, and decrease eGFR and abnormal urinary findings (leukocyturia, hematuria, and cylindruria). β2MG levels increase progressively with decreasing eGFR and rising proteinuria. KIM-1 mediates adaptive reactions of the renal epithelium to ischemic lesions [ 30 10 Inflammatory profile KIM-1 levels increase with serum pro-inflammatory factors (ESR, AGP) in SLE. β2MG levels increase in inflammatory processes. KIM-1 regulates NF κB, STAT3/ERK1/2. β-MG promotes M1/M2 polarization [ 28 31 Disease activity KIM-1 correlates with disease severity. β2MG levels vary significantly with SLEDAI. KIM-1 and β2MG levels vary with the clinical course of SLE [ 13 16 ",
