Resistance to treatment is common across various tumour types, driven by multiple mechanisms. One emerging contributor is protein methylation, a post-translational modification mediated by protein methyltransferases (PMTs), which regulate protein function by adding methyl groups, mainly on lysine and arginine residues. Dysregulation of protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) has been linked to cancer progression and drug resistance, making them attractive therapeutic targets. Consequently, several small-molecule PMT inhibitors have been developed, with some progressing to clinical trials. However, many candidates showing promise in preclinical studies fail to demonstrate efficacy or safety in later stages, limiting clinical success. This gap highlights the need to rethink current approaches to PMT inhibitor design. A deeper understanding of PMT mechanisms, catalytic domains, and their roles in chemoresistance is essential for creating more selective, potent, and clinically viable inhibitors. This review will summarise major chemoresistance pathways and PMTs implicated in cancer, then explore current and prospective PMT inhibitor classes. Building on mechanistic insights, we propose strategies to develop next-generation inhibitors with improved therapeutic potential against chemoresistant cancers. protein methylation protein methyltransferases (PMTs) PMT inhibitors methylproteomics chemoresistance This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction 1.1. Challenge to Treatment Chemoresistance is recognised as the greatest challenge in the successful treatment of cancer by chemotherapy, with the development and proliferation of highly aggressive phenotypes resulting in an associated poor prognosis. Given the well-documented impact of methylation on protein expression levels through its action on histones, it is no surprise that protein methyltransferase (PMT) inhibitors have been considered as potential therapeutics to prevent or counter specific chemoresistance mechanisms, at least in a subset of patients, in the hopes of increasing the possibility of obtaining long-term benefits with the currently administered chemotherapeutic regimens. However, despite this knowledge related to histones, there is at present a lack of understanding as to the biological relevance of non-histone proteins targeted by PMTs as part of chemoresistance mechanisms. The greatest stumbling block presently is that the functional role played by PMTs in either the development or the maintenance of chemoresistance is largely unresolved, preventing the rational design of targeted inhibitors. In the absence of clear mechanistic information, inhibiting the function of a PMT yields unpredictable clinical responses, where variability in efficacy and toxicity limits the safe inclusion of PMT inhibitors into combinatorial cancer therapy. For this reason, effective design of PMT inhibitors requires understanding at least the core mechanism of methyl addition for the different PMT families and understanding their role in the major chemoresistance pathways, thus ensuring inhibitors are designed with high specificity and sensitivity for clinical application. 1.2. Chemoresistance Mechanisms Across cancer types, therapeutic evasion is generally achieved by one or more of the following strategies employed by malignant cells. These mechanisms have been reviewed in detail elsewhere [ 1 2 3 From a genetic perspective, mutations that result in structural changes to the enzymes that the drugs interact with, such as alterations to catalytic sites that affect either drug binding or enzyme activation. For example, mutated topoisomerase II confers resistance to etoposide and doxorubicin [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 Another dominant mechanism is increased efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs, often mediated by either overexpression or increased activity of transporter proteins, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. For example, increased expression of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance 1) provides resistance to various anti-cancer drugs, including paclitaxel, olaparib [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Equally widespread among tumours is enhanced activity of detoxifying enzymes like cytochrome P450, which increases drug inactivation. For example, increased expression of glutathione transferases (GSTs) and production of glutathione (GSH) are effectively employed by tumours to detoxify many alkylating agents and platinum-based drugs [ 18 Epigenetic and epiproteomic alterations are also frequently observed. Epigenetic changes are most commonly DNA methylation changes, including aberrant methylation of the ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 promoters to increase their expression [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Other mechanisms include enhanced DNA repair capabilities [ 26 27 28 29 30 30 31 2. Protein Methylation 2.1. Types and Function The cell has the ability to broadly modulate protein properties through the addition of post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly methylation. These epiproteomic changes allow for fast cellular responses with minimal energy expenditure. Protein methylation involves the transfer of a CH 3 32 33 34 One or more CH 3 35 Multiple CH 3 3 36 37 38 At a protein level, whilst methylation does not affect the overall charge of the residue, there is an associated increase in both hydrophobicity and bulkiness around the modified residue, which in turn can alter protein properties such as protein–protein interactions and recognitions, having a downstream impact on gene regulation [ 39 40 In the context of cancer, the most well-studied substrates for methylation are histones, with exceptional focus on histones 3 and 4. Beyond histones, however, methylation has been identified on a wide range of non-histone proteins involved in transcription, DNA repair, RNA metabolism, and signal transduction on both arginine [ 37 41 42 43 44 45 42 46 47 41 45 2.2. The Methyl Cycle: S-Adenosylmethionine Production The primary methyl group donor for methylating various substrates, including DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and other molecules, is S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is synthesised from the conjugation of adenosine from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with methionine. The reaction is catalysed by SAM synthetase (also known as. methionine adenosyltransferase; MAT), which dephosphorylates a molecule of ATP in the presence of potassium and magnesium ions [ 48 49 Methylation reactions are catalysed by methyltransferases and release S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH or AdoHC). SAH is a competitive inhibitor of MTases and is hydrolysed by adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY) to homocysteine (Hcy). This reaction is reversible, meaning that increased Hcy levels can lead to the accumulation of SAH, which can bring about a lower methylation capacity. This can be represented as the SAM/SAH ratio [ 50 51 52 Figure 1 53 Because SAM serves as the universal methyl donor, its dysregulation perturbs a wide spectrum of methyltransferase reactions, thereby modulating key metabolic pathways [ 54 55 56 57 58 2.3. Protein Methyltransferases Methyltransferases across all families, irrespective of their substrates, typically have catalytic domains consisting of a well-conserved SAM-binding pocket, together with highly variable substrate acceptor regions [ 36 59 3 N 60 In the most basic arrangement, the Rossmann-like fold consists of regions of alternating β-strands and α-helices. This produces a flat β-sheet at the centre, with a set of helices on either side of the sheet. In such an arrangement, the N-terminal β-strand is located in the middle of the sheet, with the strand topology following the order 3-2-1-4-5-7-6, and having the 7th strand anti-parallel to the other strands. Furthermore, functionally important, conserved residues in such enzymes are often found either at the C-termini of the β-strands or else in the adjoining loops [ 61 Despite their diversity, most PMTs can be clustered into three superfamilies, namely the Seven-β-strand (7βS) domain family, the SpoU-TrmD (SPOUT) domain family and the Su(var)3–9, enhancer of zeste (E(z)), and trithorax (trx) (SET) domain family based on their sequence similarities and conserved regions within their catalytic domains [ 34 44 62 The 7βS family features a core structure containing two domains, a seven-stranded Rossmann-fold domain forming the binding site for the methyl donor SAM and a β-barrel for dimerisation [ 63 61 34 64 65 66 For the scope of this review the focus will be on the 7βS and SET domain families since the two major groups of PMTs, i.e., protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) fall within these families. 2.3.1. Protein Lysine Methyltransferases (PKMTs) Over 50 PKMTs have been identified in humans [ 45 62 67 68 34 60 44 60 69 70 67 Those PKMTs having a SET domain present the typical small β-sheets that produce a knot-like structure, with a pre-SET, post-SET and iSET domains. The helical structure formed by the iSET domain contributes to the formation of a narrow channel connecting the SAM binding surface and the substrate pocket through which the amine of the lysine residue to be methylated on the substrate is oriented and can access the SAM [ 61 60 71 The non-SET domain KMT category is currently composed of disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like (DOT1L) (which makes up KMT4) and a few members of the Methyltranferase-like (METTL) family [ 33 59 60 71 72 73 74 33 72 75 76 2.3.2. Protein Arginine Methyltransferases (PRMTs) A total of nine PRMTs have been identified in humans. As part of the 7βS family, the PRMT family members share a common overall structure consisting of a methyltransferase domain, a 7-β-barrel Rossmann fold domain (that interacts with SAM) and a dimerisation arm [ 77 41 78 These 9 enzymes are divided into three sub-types, with all three sub-types giving rise to MMA, but then Type I and Type II PRMTs subsequently proceed further to produce ADMA and SDMA, respectively [ 68 37 38 Moreover, PRMTs have preferences for certain motifs flanking the arginine to be methylated. PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT6, PRMT8 prefer glycine-arginine-rich (GAR/RGG/RG) motifs [ 37 78 78 78 37 60 78 79 2.3.3. Cancer Dysregulation The increased expression of PKMTs, particularly Euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2), Enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2), SET domain containing 7 (SETD7), SETD8, SET domain bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase 1 (SETDB1), SET And MYND Domain Containing 2 (SYMD2) and SYMD3 as well as PRMTs including PRMT1, PRMT3, PRMT5 and PRMT6 in a variety of tumours of different types and origins has been shown to promote chemoresistance through cell cycle progression [ 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 2.4. Classes of Methyltransferase Inhibitors Although PMTs are structurally diverse, they share a conserved architecture composed of two functional pockets, the SAM binding pocket and the methyl-substrate binding pocket. PMT inhibitors can thus be sub-divided based on the region of the enzyme they target and their mode of action (either covalent and non-covalent binders). More specifically, inhibitors can be designed to compete with the methyl donor, the methylation substrate or an essential cofactor, or alternatively bind at allosteric sites found either within the active or at alternative inactive states [ 63 2.4.1. SAM Competitive Inhibitors SAM competitors or mimetics compete with the methyl donor for the SAM binding pocket of the PMT thus preventing the enzyme from functioning and adding the methylation to the target protein [ 87 88 89 90 91 92 Despite a large number of SAM competitors having been developed, unfortunately, many such inhibitors present limited specificity given that all methyltransferases use SAM as their methyl donor. Designing SAM competitive inhibitors is a challenge due to the high hydrophilicity of SAM requiring inhibitors to have a high enough polarity to be able to interact with the SAM binding pocket, whilst at the same time presenting sufficient hydrophobicity to be able to traverse cellular membranes in order to reach their target. However, the greatest limitation to such inhibitors is the high intracellular levels of SAM with which they must compete [ 93 2.4.2. Substrate Competitive Inhibitors This class of inhibitors compete with the protein substrate to be methylated for the substrate binding pocket of the PMT. The development of substrate competitive inhibitors is a preferred strategy due to ample structural diversity within the substrate binding pocket of PMTs, allowing for increased specificity (given the selective nature of substrate recruitment) as well as having a lower polarity requirement compared to SAM competitive inhibitors [ 93 A few examples of the more potent and promising substrate inhibitors are presented in Table 1 2.4.3. Bisubstrate Inhibitors Inhibitors within this class occupy both the SAM and substrate PMT pockets. There are very few confirmed inhibitors within this class, with a few documented examples being the SET7/9 inhibitor set of AzaAdoMet substituted with various alkylamino groups [ 116 117 118 119 2.4.4. Allosteric Inhibitors This class of inhibitors impede enzyme activity by binding to sites on the PMT other than its two active site pockets. The best known of such inhibitors is the PRMT3 inhibitor SGC707. Since PRMT3 forms homodimers to perform its function, SGC707 binds to the pocket at the base of the dimerisation arm of the first monomer and the α-Y segment of the activation helix of the second monomer, inhibiting the formation of the PRMT3 homodimer as a result of its introduction [ 120 121 2.4.5. Complex Disrupting Inhibitors Many PMTs form multi sub-unit complexes where the integrity of the complex is critical in order for the PMTs to perform their function. This opens the possibility of developing inhibitors that target regions other that the catalytic domain. EZH1/2 must form part of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) complex together with at least three other PRC2 sub-units in order to be enzymatically active. One of these sub-units is Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED). Numerous inhibitors have thus been developed that bind to EED and disrupt the formation of the PRC2 complex [ 122 123 124 125 126 127 Mixed-lineage leukaemia protein 1 (MLL1 also known as. Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A—KMT2A) or MLL fusion proteins form a complex with the transcriptional regulators Menin or WD repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5). Although these proteins are not required for MLL1 catalytic activity, they are still critical components of context-specific MLL complexes and as such can be targeted to indirectly block the activity of MLL. Menin interacts with the N-terminal region of MLL proteins [ 128 129 36 130 131 132 PRMT5 forms a complex with methylosome protein 50 (MEP50 also known as. WDR77 or p44), which acts as a co-factor, in order to achieve its methyltransferase activity [ 133 134 135 136 137 2.4.6. Covalent Inhibitors The vast majority of PMT inhibitors developed so far, irrespective of which region of the enzyme they bind to, tend to be reversible (non-covalent) inhibitors. Covalent inhibitors are designed to consist of a peptide sequence or chemical structure that can covalently bind to a nucleophilic amino acid that is not well conserved within or in the immediate vicinity of the PMT active site via a reactive group, called a warhead, which is generally an alkylating, acylating, phosphonylating, or sulfonylating functional group [ 138 139 138 140 141 Targeting PMTs with covalent inhibitors offers several advantages compared to using non-covalent equivalents, as these often exhibit superior potency and biochemical efficiency due to their irreversible, non-equilibrium-based mechanism of action [ 139 142 142 139 140 142 A few noteworthy examples include the EZH2 inhibitor SKLB-03176 [ 143 144 112 145 146 2.4.7. PROTAC Inhibitors More recently, targeted protein degradation has been applied to PMT inhibition through PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs). These are bifunctional molecules consisting of a bait moiety that binds to the target protein and a moiety that binds an E3 ubiquitin ligase such as Von Hippel−Lindau (VHL) or Cereblon (CRBN) [ 147 148 The inhibition of methylation by PROTACs has so far only been implemented against a small number of PKMTs and PRMTs namely the PKMTs EHMT2, EZH2 and NSD2 and the PRMTs PRMT3, PRMT4 and PRMT5. As for the PKMT PROTACs, MS8709 [ 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 Apart from targeting the PMTs directly, interacting sub-units of the PMTs within protein complexes have also been targeted for degradation resulting in the destabilisation of the entire complex. The two proteins targeted in this manner so far are EED as part of the PRC2 complex and WDR5 as part of the MLL (KMT2A) complex. The PROTACs designed to target EED are UNC6852 [ 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 In some cases, PROTACs have been reported to demonstrate greater potency than their parent conventional inhibitor. However, despite the promise displayed so far, there are still challenges in transitioning these molecules from in vitro to clinical testing, one of which is the development of resistance by tumour cells to the commonly used E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands VHL and CRBN through mutations or down-regulation of the ubiquitin ligase mechanism [ 176 177 178 179 2.4.8. Inhibitor Limitations As outlined above, selective inhibitors are currently only available against a small sub-set of the known PMTs. This is due to the fact that the enzymatic domain is highly conserved. Segregating methyltransferases based on the structural diversity of their SAM-binding site produces two groups, with the first containing SET domain PMTs, whilst a second contains PRMTs, small molecule-, DNA- and RNA-methyltransferases, which all share a cofactor-binding Rossman fold. This clustering underscores the high likelihood of off-target effects when attempting to design an inhibitor that targets the SAM-binding site of a selected PRMT [ 63 Although the relatively high sequence conservation at the SAM-binding site makes inhibitor design challenging, given that the ATP-binding pocket of kinases and the cofactor binding pocket of PMTs have been shown to present a similar level of structural diversity [ 87 63 36 Furthermore, most of the inhibitors developed thus far are reversible and despite the apparent benefits of covalent inhibitors, it is still difficult to identify adequate warheads to covalently bind to weaker nucleophilic amino acids such as lysine and methionine and since PMT targets do not always contain adequate cysteine, lysine or methionine residues within their active sites, targeting other nucleophilic residues such as tyrosine, serine, threonine, and histidine, is harder since these are less explored [ 139 140 139 138 141 Another challenge is the widespread presence and on-going development of pan-PMT inhibitors, which offer limited clinical benefit. These inhibitors not only target PMTs that may be essential for basic cellular function, making it difficult to predict the overall impact on tissues and organs, but often exhibit highly variable potencies across the PMTs they affect. Achieving a dosing balance that adequately inhibits all intended targets is extremely difficult, frequently resulting in toxicity. 3. Failure to Clinic Most of the inhibitors developed so far are only useful for in vitro experiments since their specificity and sensitivity are not always up to the desired clinical standard. Moreover, even those inhibitors that do make it to clinical trials run the risk of becoming ineffective due to the development of resistance. Designing more effective inhibitors requires a clear understanding of the biochemical and physiological reasons underlying failures in preclinical or clinical trials. Various reviews have listed the compounds that have entered clinical trials, their use, and failure point [ 180 181 182 183 184 185 185 Computational chemistry, through the implementation of molecular docking, combined with structural biology using PMT crystal structures, provides an invaluable tool set to guide drug design. The data collected from failed trials will provide a stronger basis for in silico prediction using high-throughput screening assays, including virtual screenings [ 178 180 4. Considerations for Designing Novel PMT Inhibitors PMT inhibitors need to have sufficient potency, selectivity, and cell permeability to be successfully implemented in the clinic. Developing selective PMT inhibitors and improving their clinical efficacy will require approaches beyond incremental modifications of existing inhibitory molecules, with greater emphasis on exploring alternative inhibitory mechanisms. However, this is particularly challenging because all PMTs use SAM as the methyl donor and function through an almost identical mechanism to incorporate the methyl group. The fact that they share highly similar SAM- and substrate-binding pockets limits opportunities for designing selective inhibitors. In turn, targeting the non-catalytic domains of PMTs is still relatively unexplored, making the assessment of their chemical tractability a compelling area for further research. Specifically to improve peptide-based inhibitors, one possibility is to replace the peptide backbone with peptide mimics, called peptoids or peptidomimetics ( Figure 2 138 186 187 186 187 186 Despite the extensive literature on PMT inhibitors, the precise molecular mechanisms by which many of them engage their targets, such as binding kinetics, induced conformational changes, or effects on multi-protein complexes remain poorly defined, limiting efforts to design improved inhibitors. In order to make PMT inhibitor targeting safe for clinical application, the broad use of SAM by a wide variety of enzymes and the similarity between the active sites of enzymes within the same family pose significant challenges to overcome in PMT inhibitor specificity. Considering that each PMT has hundreds of substrate proteins fulfilling very diverse cellular roles, it is expected that perturbing the PMT concentration will have implications on numerous biochemical pathways, some of which may be essential and non-redundant for non-cancerous cells. Given the growing repertoire of PMT inhibitors, there is a pressing need for comprehensive biochemical and biophysical characterisation, at least for the more successful and promising of the existing PMT inhibitors [ 60 39 40 Inhibitor validation should begin with an in vitro assessment of the level of inhibition of methylation activity. This can be achieved either by quantifying methylated protein products or the by-product SAH, for which both direct or indirect approaches exist [ 188 189 188 SAH quantification can be performed directly using anti-SAH antibodies or mass spectrometry. Indirect SAH-quantification methods include radioisotope-labelled assays (using SAM with a tritiated methyl group), a variety of enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric (colorimetric/fluorecence/luminescence) assays (such as reactive thio-mediated chromogenic assays, adenine/xanthine-mediated colorimetric assays, ATP-mediated luminogenic assays, fluorescence polarisation assays and fluorescence lifetime assays), antibody-based assays (namely enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassays (DELFIA)), proximity assays (in the form of proximity homogeneous assays or time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays), microfluidic capillary electrophoresis, and reporter assays (either using chemical labelling of methyltransferase substrates or cell-based reporter assays) [ 188 189 Ultimately, the most promising inhibitors will need to be evaluated in disease-relevant or animal models to demonstrate their bioavailability, cell permeability and target engagement within cells as well as their impact on upstream and downstream signalling pathways, thereby bridging the gap from in vitro potency to therapeutic relevance [ 40 188 Both the mechanistic information on substrate docking and the interaction crystal structure provide key information that not only helps to better understand the mode of action and biological effects that these inhibitors have on their target PMTs but also to identify the strengths and limitations of the different design strategies. Such information should thus become a benchmark for any future inhibitors developed. A particularly important segment of missing information is related to the impact that the dysregulated PMTs have on the mechanisms of specific chemotherapeutic drug classes. Since each cancer type is treated with a limited number of chemotherapeutics and generally has a handful of commonly dysregulated PMTs, knowing such information would be key towards providing more targeted treatment regimens and avoiding administration of ineffective medication [ 185 Another aspect to consider is what the inhibitor is designed to target. In most cases, the inhibitor docking is designed against the canonical sequence and 3D shape; however this does not represent the active form of the PMT. Proteins can be active within cells as functionally different molecules stemming from a combination of genetic polymorphisms, RNA splice variants, and multiple PTMs, and this chemical diversity at a protein level produced from a single gene is collectively described as proteoforms [ 190 191 192 191 193 193 As further efforts are made to transition such PMT inhibitors towards clinical application, it is important to also remember that cancer cells will eventually find ways of developing resistance to at least some of these inhibitors, and any prior biochemical and biophysical knowledge will come in handy to overcome such resistance. The best document case so far is for EZH2, where in lymphomas, resistance against inhibitors such as GSK126, EPZ6438 and UNC1999 was acquired through single point mutations at positions I109K, Y111L/N/D, Y661D, C663Y and Y726F, which prevented inhibitor binding [ 194 195 196 197 Despite the acquisition of resistance against a specific inhibitor, treatment with an inhibitor that targets the same PMT through a different binding mechanism might be able to bypass the acquired resistance in at least some of the tumours [ 196 124 125 170 198 199 199 200 5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what the roles of at least the major PMTs implicated in cancer chemoresistance are, a collection of patient tumour data from cancer cohorts that are characterised at a protein level, not just genetically, will be essential. So far the literature mostly presents data related to the effects of inhibitors on PMTs dysregulated at the onset of tumour formation. Protein data collected before and after patient treatment with such PMT inhibitors would also provide information on off-target effects as well as key downstream outcomes linked to the combined action of the PMT inhibitor and the chemotherapeutic drug, allowing for improved design or dose administration adjustments. There is, as of yet, very limited literature related to PMT inhibitor efficacy, particularly in relation to countering chemoresistance. In order to collect reliable data in this regard, there is a need to develop novel experimental techniques for determining PMT inhibitor efficacy, PMT expression quantification, and activity testing. This goes hand in hand with improved or new strategies for higher efficiency of protein and methyl-peptide enrichment, such as antibody-based immunoprecipitation, methyl-lysine/arginine affinity resins, or chemical labelling approaches to selectively capture methylated peptides [ 201 32 56 202 203 202 A particularly interesting and impactful future consideration involves the investigation of combinatorial therapies of PMT inhibitors with other small molecule therapeutics already in clinical use, given that tumours often employ multiple chemoresistance mechanisms in parallel. One strategy would be to pair PMT inhibitors with immunomodulatory molecules such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, since protein methylation by EZH2 in tumour-infiltrating regulatory T-cells contributes to immune evasion [ 204 205 206 207 208 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, B.B.; writing—original draft preparation, I.M.; writing—review and editing, B.B.; supervision, B.B.; project administration, B.B.
