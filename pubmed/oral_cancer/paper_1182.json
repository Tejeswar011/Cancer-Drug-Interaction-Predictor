Although doxorubicin (DOX) is commonly used in cancer treatment, it causes serious side effects on healthy tissues. This study investigates new drug candidates synthesized from aryl hydrazonal compounds that target the Hsp90 protein, a key molecule for cancer cell survival. Among the 2S-series compounds tested, 2S-13 showed strong anticancer effects, especially in the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Compared to DOX, 2S-13 had lower toxicity on healthy cells and higher selectivity toward cancer cells. Molecular experiments revealed that 2S-13 affects crucial cancer-related pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and apoptosis. Flow cytometry results showed that 2S-13 causes cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and promotes apoptosis in cancer cells. Further, molecular docking results confirmed that 2S-13 binds more strongly to the ATP site of Hsp90 than that of DOX, suggesting a better inhibitory effect. In conclusion, 2S-13 is a promising anticancer candidate with high efficacy and low toxicity, especially for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. Abstract Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Although doxorubicin (DOX) is widely used in its treatment, its dose-dependent toxicity and the development of drug resistance reduce its therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, this study aims to identify a novel anticancer agent that is more effective than DOX, inhibits cancer cell growth, and is less toxic to healthy cells. Methods: The cytotoxic effects of DOX and 2S-series molecules were evaluated on human (MDA-MB-231) and mouse (4T1) TNBC breast cancer cell lines and healthy breast epithelial (hTERT) cells using MTT assays at 48 and 72 h to screen functional similarities and possible differences upon drug/inhibitor treatment. Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Gene expression profiles were assessed by qPCR, and binding interactions with Hsp90 were examined via molecular docking.

Introduction Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15% of breast cancers and is defined by a loss of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and the absence of HER2 amplification/overexpression. Due to the limited availability of early prognostic tools, frequent recurrence and metastatic spread, and the absence of validated targeted therapies, outcomes are poorer compared to those of other subtypes Despite the well-known cardiotoxicity and resistance in approximately 30–50% of patients, anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin) remain the standard of care [ 1 2 3 Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone responsible for the folding, stabilization, and activation of numerous oncogenic client proteins, including key nodes in the PI3K–AKT and MAPK signaling pathways central to TNBC biology [ 4 5 5 6 7 4 Pyridazine is a six-membered heterocyclic molecule with nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 2. These nitrogen atoms give off chemical characteristics like chelating, hydrogen bonding, and protonation. These characteristics make pyridazine derivatives one of the structures that chemical and pharmaceutical research is most interested in [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 The aim of this study was to identify a new anticancer agent that is more effective than doxorubicin (DOX) in inhibiting TNBC cell proliferation while exhibiting minimal toxicity against non-malignant hTERT cells. To this end, we designed and synthesized a 24-member library of pyridazine-centered aryl-hydrazone derivatives, tested their inhibitory effects on human MDA-MB-231 and mouse 4T1 TNBC cell lines using standard dose–response assays, and evaluated their selectivity against hTERT. In parallel, since Hsp90 keeps oncogenic proteins in an active state and supports survival signaling in cancer cells, we evaluated compound binding to the Hsp90 N-terminal ATP pocket in silico. Additionally, we elucidated the underlying mechanisms by examining the effects of the compounds and DOX on cancer pathways, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, and identified candidates with superior activity compared to DOX. 2.

Cell Culture MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 were selected as representative models of human and mouse TNBC, respectively, due to their well-characterized aggressive phenotypes and widespread use in preclinical studies. Mouse 4T1 is widely used for in vivo metastasis models, as it mimics human TNBC progression and the immune environment. It provides comparative insights between human and murine TNBC biology. The hTERT-immortalized breast epithelial cell line was used to evaluate selectivity and cytotoxicity against healthy cells. Commercially available 4T1 (CRL-2539), MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26), and hTERT (CRL-4010) cell lines (The American Type Culture Collection: ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were incubated at 37 °C, with 5% CO 2 3 2.3. Dissolving 2S-Series Molecules The synthesized 2S-series molecules were weighed according to their molecular weight. The substances were dissolved with DMSO so that the main stock was 100 mM. Intermediate stocks were prepared by dilution with ddH 2 2.4. MTT Tests 2.4.1. Determination of Anticancer Activities of 2S-Series Molecules The purpose of these experiments was to determine the cytotoxic effects of 2S-series compounds and compare their potency with that of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) using a colorimetric MTT viability assay. For viability experiments of molecules in cell lines, the 4T1, MDA-MB-231, and hTERT cell lines were removed with Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) when they reached sufficient cell density in culture dishes. They were seeded in 96-well cell plates with 7 × 10 3 2.4.2. Determination of Anticancer Activities of 2S-Series Molecules The anticancer activity of 2S-5 and 2S-13 inhibitors in the 4T1, MDA-MB-231, and hTERT cell lines was assessed using MTT assays at 48 and 72 h (n = 5). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 7 × 10 3 2.4.3. Doxorubicin (DOX) Application To determine the IC 50 3 2.5. RT-QPCR Array The aim of the RT-qPCR analysis was to determine the expression changes in genes associated with cancer-related signaling pathways in response to treatment with DOX and 2S-13. The total RNA extractions were performed with Innuprep Rna Mini Kit 2.0 Analytik Jena and via the synthesis of cDNA with 1000 ng of total RNA using ABM Good cDNA Synthesis Kit. For real-time q-PCR, active genes in human and mouse cancer cell pathways were examined in the cells before and after drug application, and the drug effect was examined at the gene expression level. The amount of DNA was determined after each replication by binding the fluorescent dye in the PCR mixture to the DNA, thus giving a C T −ΔΔCt 2.6. Cell Cycle Analysis The analysis was carried out in accordance with the instructions of the MAK344 Cell Cycle Analysis kit. MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells (6 × 10 5 2.7. Apoptosis Analysis The apoptosis assay was used to quantify early and late apoptotic events triggered by 2S-13 and DOX, providing insights into the mechanism of cell death. The analysis was carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Annexin V FITC—Apoptosis Detection Kit. MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells (6 × 10 5 2.8. Molecular Docking Analysis The molecular structures of the 2S-5 and 2S-13 ligands were drawn using MarvinSketch (ChemAxon ® Molecular docking simulations were conducted using YASARA Structure software ( https://www.yasara.org/ For each ligand (DOX, 2S-5, and 2S-13), 25 docking poses were generated. The pose with the lowest (most negative) binding energy was selected for further analysis. Binding energies (in kcal/mol) and corresponding dissociation constants (KD values) were calculated to assess and compare the binding affinities of the compounds to the Hsp90α NTD. 3. Results 3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of 2S-Series The 2S-series compounds were obtained through the reaction of related aryl hydrazone derivatives with ethyl 3-oxo-4-(triphenyl-λ 5 Scheme 1 1 13 Molecular formulas, melting points, reaction yields and HRMS analysis data of the synthesized and characterized 2S compounds are given in Table 1 As a representative example, the characterization of compound 2S-1 is presented in this section. Following purification procedures after the reaction, compound 2S-1 was isolated with a yield of 74%. Furthermore, the calculated and observed HRMS values for [M+H] + 21 18 2 3 −1 −1 −1 1 d6 2 3 13 d6 2 3 3.2. Effect of 2S-Series Molecules on 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 Cell Line Figure 1 The cell viability results of the 2S-series compounds (2S-1 to 2S-24) in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line are shown in Figure 2 Figure 1 19 20 21 22 Although several analogs (e.g., 2S-3, 2S-7, 2S-19) reduced viability to below 50% in the TNBC lines at screening concentrations, they exhibited greater cytotoxicity in non-malignant hTERT cells and therefore did not meet our pre-specified selectivity criterion (selectivity index, SI; see Methods). Consequently, these compounds were not advanced. By contrast, 2S-5 and 2S-13 satisfied both potency and selectivity requirements and were prioritized for mechanistic studies. 3.3. Cytotoxic Effect of 2S-5 and 2S-13 Molecules on Cell Lines The cytotoxic effects of 2S-5 and 2S-13 were evaluated on the 4T1 mouse TNBC cell line at 48 and 72 h using a range of concentrations (1.5625–100 µM). As shown in Figure 3 The cytotoxic effects of 2S-5 and 2S-13 were further investigated in the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 at 48 and 72 h with the same concentration range of 1.5625–100 µM. Both compounds exhibited a concentration- and time-dependent increase in cell inhibition, consistent with the observations in the 4T1 cell line. The 2S-5 molecules showed higher inhibition rates compared to the 2S-13 ones at both time points, particularly at higher concentrations. These results suggest that prolonged exposure and increasing concentration enhance the antiproliferative effects of both compounds in human TNBC cells, with 2S-5 showing relatively greater potency ( Figure 4 The cytotoxic effects of 2S-5 and 2S-13 molecules on healthy breast cells at 48 and 72 h were investigated. Increasing the concentration and incubation time for both molecules led to a decrease in inhibition values and an increase in cell viability ( Figure 5 When the anticancer effect of 2S-5 and 2S-13 molecules on all cell lines applied above and the toxicity to healthy breast cells were compared, it was determined that the 2S-13 molecule was more effective. Therefore, the mechanism of the 2S-13 molecule was selected to be examined in human and mouse TNBC breast cancer cell lines via RT-QPCR and flow cytometry experiments. 3.4. Cytotoxic Effect of DOX on Cell Lines The cytotoxic effect of DOX at concentrations ranging from 1.5625 to 100 µM was examined on hTERT, 4T1, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. The highest inhibition and cell death rate were observed in the hTERT cell line ( Figure 5 Figure 3 Figure 4 Table 2 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 When the SI values of DOX were examined, it showed a highly toxic effect on healthy cells since the SI was <1 in the 4T1 cell line. However, the 48H SI value of the 2S-13 inhibitor was calculated to be less than 10, 7.90 µM in the 4T1 cell line. At 72 h, there was a better SI value, and this was found to be higher than 10 (SI = 14.08 µM). In the MDA-MB-231 cell line, the 2S-13 inhibitor showed a much better SI value than 4T1. While the SI value at 48 h was 25.45 µM, the SI value at 72 h was calculated to be 35.09 µM. 3.5. RT-qPCR Array Experiments Changes in the gene expressions of DOX and 2S-13 inhibitors in the 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line were determined with the RT-qPCR experiment. The expression values of genes given with the 2 −ΔΔCt The expression alteration profiles of DOX in the 4T1 cell line are shown in Figure 6 Figure 7 Some signaling pathways that changed in terms of gene expression in the presence of 2S-13 in the 4T1 cell line are pathways in cancer, the MAPK signaling pathway, apoptosis, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and then the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, as well as the RAP1 and cell cycle pathways ( Figure 8 Figure 9 The altered expression profile in the MDA-MB-231 cell line following treatment with DOX is shown in Figure 10 Key signaling pathways that changed by gene expressions in the presence of DOX in the 4T1 cell line are the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, pathways in cancer, the MAPK signaling pathway, the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway, the cell cycle pathway, apoptosis and the RAP1 signaling pathway ( Figure 11 The altered expression profile in the MDA-MB-231 cell line after treatment with 2S-13 is shown in Figure 12 Figure 13 3.6. Cell Cycle Analysis with Flow Cytometry Figure 14 Table 3 3.7. Apoptosis Analysis with Flow Cytometry This assay, used to determine the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, is based on initially staining the cells with Annexin V (AV) and propidium iodide (PI) solution, followed by detection by flow cytometry analysis. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is one of the phospholipids found in the cell membrane, and N-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was designed for the detection of apoptotic cells, which binds to PS with high affinity. In normal cells, phosphatidylserine is found in the inner membrane (the side facing the cytoplasm). However, when cells are subjected to apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is found in the outer membrane because the membrane integrity is disrupted. Red fluorescent PI dye, which binds to DNA, rapidly enters cells with damaged membranes. While living cells with intact membranes are impermeable to PI, the membranes of dead and damaged cells are permeable to PI. Figure 15 While the percentages of 4T1 cells treated with DOX were 30.31% early apoptotic and 8.91% late apoptotic cells, the percentages of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with DOX were 22.00% early apoptotic, 21.54% late apoptotic and 5.21% necrotic cells, as can be seen in Figure 16 Table 4 3.8. Docking Studies To understand the inhibition mechanism of Hsp90, the human Hsp90α NTD crystal structure (pdb code: 3T0Z) was examined using the molecular docking method with DOX, 2S-5 and 2S-13 inhibitors. Additionally, the interaction of ATP with Hsp90 NTD was examined. The binding energy and dissociation constant (K D Figure 16 When the inhibitors were examined, the binding energy of 2S-13 was 7.430 kcal/mol and that of KD was 3579.07 nM, while the binding energy of 2S-5 was 7.578 kcal/mol and the KD was 2792.66 nM; the binding energy of DOX was 7.278 kcal/mol, and the KD was calculated as 4633.6 nM. Lower binding energy values indicate stronger binding affinity between the ligand and the target protein, whereas higher values reflect weaker or non-specific interactions. The binding energies of 2S-5 and 2S-13 were higher, and these inhibitors bind to the ATP binding site of Hsp90α NTD with a higher affinity compared to ATP and DOX ( Figure 17 4. Discussion In this study, 2S-series inhibitors synthesized via aryl hydrazonal compounds targeting the NTD of Hsp90 were used, and the anticancer effects of novel 2S-5 and 2S-13 compounds were investigated in MDA-MB-231, 4T1 and non-tumorigenic hTERT cell lines. The 2S-13 compound demonstrated lower IC 50 Apoptosis studies revealed differential mechanisms triggered by 2S-13 and DOX. DOX induced a high level of early and late apoptosis (total 39.23%), while 2S-13 showed limited apoptotic activity (11.54%) in 4T1 cells. In contrast, 2S-13 effectively induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells (total 13.44%), while DOX promoted apoptosis (total 43.54%). Gene expression profiles supported these findings: DOX upregulated FASLG (23.75-fold) in MDA-MB-231, suggesting extrinsic apoptosis, whereas 2S-13 increased APAF1, CASP9, CASP7, and BCL2L11, indicating activation of the intrinsic pathway. These results underline that 2S-13 may offer a more targeted and pathway-specific mode of action in TNBC. AURKA, an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, regulates the initiation of mitosis, spindle fiber assembly, centrosome maturation/separation, and chromosome alignment. It is overexpressed in many human cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian, bladder, stomach, and pancreatic cancers. High levels of AURKA expression in approximately 73% of breast cancer patients are associated with decreased survival rates and resistance to many anticancer drugs [ 23 MKI67 24 MKI67 The transcription factor protein family encoding E2F E2F E2F4 E2F 25 E2F4 CDK CCND2 CCND3 CDC20 GADD45G 26 GADD45G CSF1R IGF2 FGFR3 GADD45G GADD45G 27 GADD45G In the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell, the number of cells in the G0 & G1 phase increased to 70.80% after 2S-13 application. After DOX application, the number of cells in the G2 & M phase increased to 38.35%. It is thought that the application of DOX causes a decrease in the activities of cyclins and CDKs in human TNBC breast cancer cell lines and the arrest of cancer cells in the G2 & M phase. Markers related to cellular senescence and telomeric stability were also changed. Cellular senescence, while a tumor-suppressive process, can paradoxically promote tumor progression under certain conditions. Alterations in TP53 ANGPT1 VEGFC TINF2 TERF1 TEP1 TER2IP TNKS Fatty acids produce lipid signaling molecules, and abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism are closely related to the growth and differentiation of cancer cells. Aggressive cancer cells are characterized by a dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism [ 28 ACLY ACSL4 CPT2 LPL HSP90AB1 29 HSPB1 29 HSP90 HSPB1 KDR ANGPT2 TEK In conclusion, these findings indicate that 2S-13 appears to be a promising therapeutic candidate for TNBC, through the targeted induction of apoptosis, multi-pathway regulation involving cell cycle arrest, the inhibition of fatty acid metabolism, and HSP modulation. These findings support further preclinical evaluation and open up new avenues for developing Hsp90-targeted therapies in breast cancer. 5. Conclusions The results indicated that the apoptotic effect of the 2S-13 inhibitor was higher in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, and that it can prevent the growth of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells by inducing apoptosis. The 2S-13 inhibitor was found to induce cell accumulation in the G0/G1 phase in the MDA-MB-231 cell line treatment. When the expressions of genes in cancer pathways were evaluated, significant changes were found in terms of PI3K/AKT, MAPK, apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell cycle, aging, and cancer metabolism. Molecular docking studies showed that the 2S-13 inhibitor has higher binding energy. It can bind to the ATP binding site of Hsp90 NTD with higher affinity compared to ATP and DOX. Thus, it may be inferred from the results that 2S-13 has a greater inhibitory effect on Hsp90. All these results showed that 2S-13 is a promising drug candidate in the MDA-MB-231 cell line.
