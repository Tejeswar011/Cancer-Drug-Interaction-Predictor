This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/390230-first-presentation-of-endometriosis-a-case-of-acute-large-bowel-obstruction The first presentation of endometriosis as acute large bowel obstruction is rare. We present the case of a woman in her 40s with no significant past medical history presenting with acute bowel obstruction. CT imaging revealed an obstructing mass in the sigmoid colon with associated lymphadenopathy, favoured to be a malignant process. She underwent an emergency laparoscopic to open Hartmann’s procedure, where the sigmoid mass was seen causing proximal colonic distention and caecal seromuscular tears. Her case was discussed at the colorectal multidisciplinary team meeting, where pathology revealed a surprising diagnosis of endometriosis; no primary mucosal lesion was identified. This case highlights endometriosis as an important differential cause of acute bowel obstruction, even in patients with no prior history of endometriosis. acute bowel obstruction bowel endometriosis endometriosis endometriosis diagnosis hartmann’s procedure pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent inflammatory disorder characterised by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity and whose pathophysiology remains poorly understood [ 1 2 3 4 5 Radiological investigations for DIE involving the bowel may show non-specific findings such as bowel wall thickening or mass effect; however, MRI, particularly with bowel preparation and T2-weighted sequences, has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting DIE [ 6 Acute large bowel obstruction secondary to endometriosis is often challenging to diagnose preoperatively and presents a complex management dilemma. Partial or subacute obstruction can theoretically be managed with hormonal suppression, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, to relieve symptoms [ 7 Case presentation A woman in her 40s presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of worsening cramping lower abdominal pain. She denied a history of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea and rated the pain 9 out of 10 on a subjective pain scale. She had not opened her bowels for three days and reported usually having once-daily regular bowel motions. She had no past medical or surgical history that she was aware of, was nulliparous, and did not take any regular medications. She reported having a regular menstrual cycle once a month and denied any history of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or abnormal bleeding. Family history was significant for colorectal cancer (paternal grandfather). On examination, her abdomen was mildly distended but soft, and she was tender in the suprapubic and lower quadrants bilaterally. There were no signs of peritonism, and bowel sounds were present. Her vital signs were unremarkable. Initial investigations, including basic blood findings shown in Table 1 9 Table 1 Laboratory values from blood taken on the day of presentation. Investigation Units Value Reference range Haemoglobin g/L 139 115–160 White blood cell count ×10 9 11.80 4.0–11.0 Sodium mmol/L 140 135–145 Potassium mmol/L 3.80 3.50–5.20 Chloride mmol/L 106 95–110 Magnesium mmol/L 0.90 0.70–1.10 Phosphate mmol/L 1.26 0.75–1.50 Calcium mmol/L 2.45 2.10–2.60 Creatinine µmol/L 86 45–90 Lactate mmol/L 1.10 0.50–2.20 Carcinembryonic antigen µg/L 1.20 <3.50 Initial imaging with plain radiograph of the abdomen (Figure 1 2 3 4 Figure 1 Abdomen X-ray showing distended large bowel loops (red arrows). Figure 2 Pelvic ultrasound scan demonstrating uterus with a bulky fibroid measuring 27 × 20 × 21 mm (red arrow). Figure 3 Sagittal CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (A) demonstrating an obstructing mass at the sigmoid colon with thickening of the bowel wall and irregularity of the serosal surface (red arrows). Axial CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (B) demonstrating small nodules within the adjacent mesentery of the sigmoid colon (red arrow). Figure 4 Axial CT scan of the chest demonstrating a small subpleural nodule measuring 5-6 mm in the left lower lobe (red arrow). The patient now had a confirmed mechanical bowel obstruction, which was suggested to be secondary to a malignant process, and she was referred to the colorectal surgery team. The initial management plan included performing a flexible sigmoidoscopy and stenting as a bridge to definitive management with elective anterior resection. The patient was placed on intravenous fluid therapy, made nil by mouth and charted a Fleet enema, after which she had a very small bowel motion. Due to clinical deterioration, a second plain abdominal radiograph (Figure 5 Figure 5 Abdominal X-ray demonstrating increasing colonic dilation (red arrow). The MDT discussion revealed a surprising diagnosis of deep infiltrating endometriosis. Macroscopic findings showed a 38 × 38 × 30 mm tumour-like mass with undulating mucosa and thickened bowel wall in the sigmoid colon (Figure 6 7 8 Figure 6 Macroscopic slices of sigmoid colon showing normal bowel (A) and a tumour-like mass of the thickened bowel indicated by a red arrow (B).

Figure 8 Micrograph showing endometrial glands (red arrows) and stroma (blue arrow) in subserosa with associated fibrosis (hematoxylin and eosin, ×5). Specialised staining was undertaken to confirm endometrial glandular epithelium (Figure 9A 9B Figure 9 Endometrial glandular epithelium is PAX8 positive (×5) (A) and endometrial stromal cells are CD10 positive (×5) (B). Discussion Endometriosis is an enigmatic disease that can present a diagnostic and management dilemma. Although the pathophysiology of this systemic disease is not well understood, several theories have been proposed in the current literature. One of the leading theories is that of retrograde menstruation, whereby viable endometrial tissue in menstrual fluid is refluxed back through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity to implant onto pelvic organs [ 2 8 2 Bowel obstruction is an uncommon but well-documented complication of endometriosis, with most cases in the literature describing patients with known endometriosis or longstanding symptoms presenting with small or large bowel obstruction [ 4 5 9 11 12 12 9 However, bowel obstruction as an initial presentation of endometriosis is a very rare occurrence, with only two other cases reported in the literature [ 13 14 13 15 16 13 14 15 16 Interestingly, one of the cases similar to ours also underwent postoperative medical treatment with Goserelin, a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue, to treat asymptomatic residual endometriomas near the resected bowel margins seen on MRI three months after resection, with reportedly good evolution on MRI after three months of therapy [ 15 8 3 7 In this unique case, patient history, preoperative imaging, and intraoperative findings did not point to endometriosis as a cause of acute bowel obstruction. Evidently, preoperative diagnosis remains challenging; hence, laparoscopy is the gold standard tool for diagnosis [ 2 Conclusions Endometriosis is a disease of variable presentation. This case demonstrates that an absence of endometriosis history does not exclude severe disease, and surgeons should be aware of this as a cause of acute bowel obstruction in young female patients to avoid unnecessary morbidity in the form of bowel resection and stoma formation.
