Most LGSOC are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and demonstrate alterations in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Avutometinib is a dual RAF/MEK clamp, whereas defactinib and VS-4718 are focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors. Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist/degrader. We assessed the preclinical efficacy of fulvestrant, avutometinib + VS-4718 (FAKi), and the triple combination in a chemotherapy/aromatase inhibitor-resistant LGSOC patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model. Tissue obtained from a LGSOC patient wild-type for KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations in progression after chemotherapy/anastrozole was transplanted into female CB17/lcrHsd-Prkdc/SCID mice (PDX-OVA(K)250). The animals were treated with either saline/control, fulvestrant, avutometinib/FAKi, or the triple combination of avutometinib/FAKi/fulvestrant. Avutometinib and FAKi were given five-days on and two-days off through oral gavage. Fulvestrant was administered subcutaneously weekly. Mechanistic studies were performed ex vivo using Western blot assays. Animals treated with the triple combination demonstrated stronger tumor growth inhibition compared to all the other experimental groups including control/saline ( p p p p low-grade serous ovarian cancer fulvestrant avutometinib MEK inhibitor FAK inhibitor NIH U01 CA176067-01A1 Deborah Bunn Alley Foundation Domenic Cicchetti Foundation Discovery to Cure Foundation and the Guido Berlucchi Foundation NCI CA-16359 Verastem Oncology This work was supported in part by grants from NIH U01 CA176067-01A1, the Deborah Bunn Alley Foundation, the Domenic Cicchetti Foundation, the Discovery to Cure Foundation and the Guido Berlucchi Foundation to A.D.S.

Introduction Low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC) is a rare, histopathologically, molecularly, and clinically distinct tumor from high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) accounting for <10% of new epithelial ovarian tumors [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 A large number of LGSOC express estrogen receptor (ER) and harbor mutations in RAS/MAPK pathway genes including but not limited to KRAS, BRAF, and NRAS [ 9 10 11 12 13 13 14 7 15 Focal Adenosine Kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase with a vital role in cancer cell migration, proliferation, progression, and survival in multiple human tumors [ 16 17 18 19 20 Secondary to the high levels of estrogen receptor (ER) expression detected in the majority of LGSOC [ 12 21 22 NCT04111978 NCT05601700 NCT04095364 In this study, we took advantage of a PDX model developed from a patient with LGSOC who progressed after multiple lines of chemotherapy and the use of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole to investigate the antitumor activity of the estrogen receptor degrader/antagonist fulvestrant in combination with the RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib and a FAKi (VS-4078/defactinib). Finally, we performed a Western blot assay to mechanistically evaluate the effect of this novel drug combination on the RAS/MAPK pathway. 2. Results 2.1. In Vivo Antitumor Activity of Avutometinib, VS-4718, and Fulvestrant Versus Control The antitumor activities of an estrogen receptor antagonist/degrader (fulvestrant), a RAF/MEK clamp (avutometinib), and a FAK inhibitor (VS-4718) were determined by establishing xenografts from the primary LGSOC tumor sample OVA(K)250. This tumor xenograft exhibited consistent in vivo growth. Animals were randomly assigned into four different groups once tumor sizes reached 0.2 cm 3 3 3 3 3 p p 3 3 p Figure 1 p Figure 1 While the median survival for the vehicle control group was only 29 days, mice treated with fulvestrant alone, avutometinib + VS-4718, or the triple-drug regimen (avutometinib, VS-4718, and fulvestrant) survived until day 60. Overall survival (OS) difference curves between study groups receiving the combination of a three-drug, fulvestrant alone, avutometinib + VS-4718, and control were statistically significant ( p Figure 2 Figure 2 2.2. Avutometinib, VS-4718, and Fulvestrant Treatment Inhibits ERK and FAK Activation in an Ex Vivo Model of LGSOC We assessed the impact of avutometinib, defactinib, and fulvestrant on p-ERK, p-MEK, and estrogen receptor levels using Western blot analysis. The three-drug combination and the dual avutometinib + defactinib combination reduced both p-MEK and p-ERK without impacting total MEK and ERK levels after two hours of treatment in the ex vivo model compared to the untreated control ( Figure 3 3. Discussion LGSOC are rare tumors diagnosed at a younger age when compared to HGSOC patients [ 23 24 Targeting the RAS/MAPK pathway with MEKi is one of the newer treatment options for women with recurrent LGSOC. Consistent with this view, Shotton et al. assessed the effectiveness of the MEKi trametinib in the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC in a multicenter study [ 25 7 p p 26 In a recent study, we performed a preclinical evaluation of the RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib, alone and in combination with the FAK inhibitor VS-4718, in the fully characterized OVA(K)250 PDX model [ 19 p p NCT04625270 27 A large proportion of LGSOCs express estrogen receptors [ 12 22 28 29 NCT05113368 In the present study, we took advantage of a LGSOC PDX model (i.e., OVA(K)250) recently established in our laboratory from a patient in progression after multiple lines of chemotherapy and aromatase inhibitors to evaluate the antitumor activity of the estrogen receptor antagonist/degrader (fulvestrant) used alone or in combination with the novel RAF/MEK clamp avutometinib and the FAKi VS-4718 used as surrogate for the FAK inhibitor defactinib. Starting on day eight of our in vivo experiment, a significant difference in tumor growth inhibition between the drug-treated groups vs. vehicle control was observed. On day 11, mice in the control vehicle group had a mean tumor volume of 0.55 cm 3 3 p p In previous studies, Western blot results demonstrated that the levels of p-ERK were reduced in LGSOC when exposed to avutometinib and defactinib, indicating that these drugs specifically target and significantly impact the RAS/MAPK pathway [ 19 23 30 31 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Specimen Collection and Formation of PDX Models The study protocol was approved by the Yale Human Investigation Committee and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to initiating any research activities, informed consent from patients and/or their legally authorized representatives was obtained. LGSOC tissue samples were obtained from clinically indicated biopsies performed at the time of tumor recurrence. Briefly, OVA (K) 250 was xenografted with Matrigel (Corning Life Sciences, Corning, NY, USA) into female CB17/lcrHsd-Prkdc/SCID mice into the subcutaneous tissue of the lower abdomen. Tumor size was assessed 2 to 3 times per week using Vernier calipers. Once mice showed consistent PDX growth, they were randomly assigned to treatment groups as outlined below. 4.2. Avutometinib, Defactinib, VS-4718, and Fulvestrant Verastem, Inc. (Needham, MA, USA) supplied the following compounds—avutometinib, defactinib, and VS-4718—under a material transfer agreement. Fulvestrant was purchased from Northstar healthcare, Memphis, TN. VS-4718 is a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor (FAKi) frequently used in animal experiments as an experimental replacement for defactinib, the FAKi used in patients in the clinic. 4.3. In Vivo Treatment Briefly, PDX mice were randomized into treatment groups when the tumor reached a volume of 0.2 cm 3 3 2 4.4. Ex Vivo Tumor Tissue Culture and Treatment After tumor tissues were harvested from untreated OVA(K)250 PDX-bearing mice to ensure a uniform baseline without prior in vivo drug exposure, they were cut into 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm pieces. The decision was made to develop an ex vivo model to isolate tumors from mice and treat tumor pieces because these cell lines are difficult to grow in vitro and can only be propagated in vivo using PDX models. For each treatment group, we treated 5 individual tumor pieces in Petri dishes. Tumor pieces were incubated for 30 min in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing streptomycin/penicillin (Life Technologies) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 4.5. Western Blot Protein lysates of pooled tumor pieces were prepared from the same treatment group and homogenized using lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 100 mM Na 2 4 4.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism version 10 (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). Significance in tumor volumes at specific timepoints for in vivo experiments was determined using a two-way ANOVA. When the tumor in the individual mice exceeded 1.0 cm 3 p 5. Conclusions In this preclinical study, we demonstrated for the first time that the addition of fulvestrant to the active avutometinib/defactinib combination may significantly increase tumor control when compared to fulvestrant alone or compared to the combination of avutometinib plus defactinib in a KRAS wild-type LGSOC PDX model resistant to chemotherapy and aromatase inhibitor. Mechanistic studies demonstrated dephosphorylation in both ERK as well as MEK protein after exposure to the combination. These preclinical results are consistent with the encouraging data recently reported in the GOG-3052; NCT04625270 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms26188924/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, C.D., S.B., T.M.P.H., B.M., S.C., J.A.P. and A.D.S.; data curation, C.D., S.B., M.M., B.M. and Y.Y.-H.; formal analysis, C.D., S.B., V.M.E., M.G. and A.D.S.; investigation, C.D. and S.O.; methodology, C.D., S.B., M.M., T.M.P.H., N.G.S., N.S., L.P. and A.D.S.; project administration, S.B. and B.M.; resources, S.B. and B.M.; software, C.D.; supervision, S.B., V.M.E., B.M. and A.D.S.; visualization, C.D.; writing—original draft, C.D., S.B. and V.M.E.; writing—review and editing, C.D., S.B., V.M.E., M.M., T.M.P.H., B.M., M.G., Y.Y.-H., E.R., N.G.S. and A.D.S.

The triple-drug combination reduced both p-MEK and p-ERK. Total MEK and ERK levels were mildly affected. Fulvestrant was also able to decrease p-MEK levels. The triple-drug combination led to a decrease in ER protein levels. Band Weights: ER 66 kDa, p-ERK 42 kDa, ERK 44 kDa, pMEK 45 kDa, MEK 45 kDa, and TOP1 100 kDa.
