Methods Ten patients with glioblastoma awaiting surgery were administered 5.6 mg of Resveratrol (R) and 560 ng of Copper (Cu) four times a day for an average of 11.6 ± 5.37 days. Another ten patients who did not receive R-Cu acted as controls. A tissue sample was taken at operation for analysis. Results R-Cu treatment led to marked deactivation of cfChPs that were present in the tumour microenvironment, which was accompanied by a highly significant down-regulation in Ki-67, nine hallmarks of cancer, six immune check-points and three stem cell biomarkers as revealed by immuno-fluorescence analysis. Transcriptome sequencing detected marked upregulation of pro-apoptotic and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. Also detected was down-regulation of PVRIG-2P, a homologue of immune checkpoint receptor PVRIG, which is a functional analogue of PD-L1. Conclusions These results suggest that a simple, non-toxic and inexpensive combination of the commonly used nutraceuticals Resveratrol and Copper can have a profound effect on the aggressive phenotype of GBM. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether prolonged treatment with R-Cu might induce the tumours to adopt a benign phenotype.

Despite intensive combination therapies involving surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) remains an incurable disease with a median survival of 15 months [ 1 2 3 4 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 5 13 14 15 In the present study we tested the hypothesis that oral administration of R-Cu would lead to deactivation of cfChPs that are released into the TME from dying GBM cells and prevent them from aggravating the malignant phenotype of the surviving cancer cells. Our earlier clinical studies had indicated the optimum dose of R and Cu to be 5.6 mg and 560 ng respectively [ 11 12 14 16 Methods Patient details Demographic information on the ten control and ten Resveratrol and Copper (R-Cu) treated patients is given in Table S1 R-Cu tablets and dosage schedule Bi-layer tablets containing 5.6 mg of R and 560 ng of Cu were provided by Inventia Healthcare Limited which were administered to GBM patients four times a day on an empty stomach. Control patient did not receive R-Cu tablets. Sample collection Tumour tissue samples were collected at operation. One half of the sample was placed in formalin for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis and the other half was placed in RNAlater for transcriptome sequencing. Fluorescence immune-staining and confocal microscopy Fluorescence immune-staining using anti-DNA and anti-histone H4 antibodies followed by confocal microscopy was performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections to detect the presence of cfChPs in TME of tumour tissues. The detailed protocol of the procedure is described by us earlier [ 13 Immunofluorescence Methodology Indirect IF analysis on FFPE sections of tumour tissues was performed using a protocol described by us earlier [ 16 S2 Blinded analysis IF analysis was done in a blinded fashion such that the examiner was unaware of the identity of the slides being analysed. Transcriptome analysis Differential expression analysis Raw RNA-seq FASTQ files were evaluated for quality control checks using FastQC tool (v0.12.1) [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 p 23 Pathway enrichment analysis Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; v4.3.3) [ 24 25 26 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired student’s t * p ** p p p Results R-Cu treatment eradicates cfChPs from TME Confocal microscopy following fluorescent immune staining of FFPE sections using anti-DNA and anti-histone H4 revealed copious presence of cfChPs in TME of the untreated samples tissues (Fig. 1a 1a 1a p Fig. 1 Representative confocal microscopy images of tumour sections to detect cfChPs in TME, and Immunofluorescence results of Ki-67, and combined results of 15 hallmarks of cancer, 6 immune check-points and 3 stem cell markers in control and R-Cu treated GBM patients. a b n p p R-Cu treatment down-regulates cancer biomarkers We analyzed by IF on four groups of biomarkers which included: 1) Ki-67; 2) fifteen biomarkers representing nine hallmarks of cancer; 3) six immune check-points and 4) three stem cell markers. Ki-67 labeling is routinely used in clinical practice as a measure of proliferative index of GBM [ 27 p 1b S1 3 S2 1b p S2 S2 p p 1b S3 S4 We next analyzed three stem cell markers viz. CD133, CD44 and SOX2. Of these, the first two are cancer specific while SOX2 is a general stem cell marker. The combined box-plot results revealed a highly significant reduction in the R-Cu treated samples compared to untreated controls ( p 1b S5 p S5 RNA-seq analysis Quality check Out of the 20 samples, 6 samples from each group passed the quality check and were used for RNA-seq analysis. The 12 samples were sequenced for whole transcriptome analysis, with a median coverage of 42 million reads (ranging from 30-51 million) (Table S3 S6 S6b S6c Clear clustering of R-Cu transcripts Whole transcriptome multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis identified distinct separation between R-Cu from untreated samples (Fig. 2a Fig. 2 RNA-seq analysis of glioblastoma patients treated with Resveratrol-Copper identifies differential genes and pathways. a b c d Identification of differentially expressed genes and pathways A total of 955 differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through DESeq2 analysis, of which 85 genes showed upregulation with a Log2FC > 2 and padj<0.05 and 870 genes showed downregulation with a Log2FC < -2 and padj<0.05 (Fig. 2b S4 28 2b 2b S4 29 30 31 2b S4 2c, d 2b S4 32 33 Complex relationship between RNA and protein turn over We found that cancer hallmark genes BCL2, ATM CTLA4, KLRC1 1b S7 S2 S7 S4 AKT1, IL6, MYC, NFKB1, TGFB1, TP53 VEGFA, SLC2A1 CDH2 CDKN21A VIM CD44, SOX2 HAVCR2 LAG3 RAD50, CCND1 PROM1 PDCD1 CD274 S7 S2 S3 R-Cu treatment increases intrinsic apoptotic cell death A significant upregulation in gene set of hallmark apoptosis (NES = 2.899 and nominal p-value = 0) was observed in R-Cu treated samples suggesting intense activation of intrinsic cell death (Fig. 3a 3 d 3e S8 S8 Fig. 3 Transcriptomic signature indicates activation of intrinsic apoptosis and proteasomal degradation cascade upon R-Cu treatment. a b c d p e Discussion The results of this study suggests that a simple, non-toxic and inexpensive combination of the commonly used nutraceuticals Resveratrol and Copper administered orally can have a profound effect on the aggressive phenotype of GBM. This effect was ostensibly mediated via oxygen radicals that were generated upon oral ingestion of R-Cu leading to deactivation of cfChPs in TME of GBM [ 9 34 6 7 8 9 Using whole transcriptome sequencing we detected activation of extensive apoptosis in the R-Cu treated samples. A marked reduction in Bcl-2 expression and an increase in that of active caspase-3 in the treated samples provided further evidence of activation of apoptosis of GBM cells following R-Cu treatment. Immune staining followed by confocal microscopy of FFPE sections detected copious presence of cfChPs which had been released from the dying GBM cells in TME of control samples and which were virtually eliminated via the medium of ROS following a short course of R-Cu. These data indicated that R-Cu treatment had led to an intense intrinsic apoptosis of GBM cells and that the apoptotic debris was rapidly eliminated via proteosomal degradation. The latter correlated with our observation of an inverse relationship between protein expression and level of RNA transcription suggestive of efficient activation of proteasomal degradation in coordination with apoptosis [ 35 36 Whole transcriptome sequencing of R-Cu treated GBM samples detected upregulation of IGFBP7 28 GATA2, PKD1, NFIA 37 39 We observed an intricate and discrepant relationship between RNA and protein turn over in our study. This may be due to complexities translational regulation [ 40 41 42 Immunotherapy of cancer is a major breakthrough in cancer treatment. However, these targeted therapies that are currently in use are expensive and often very toxic and are generally used one at a time. Against this backdrop, our results that a simple, inexpensive and non-toxic combination of R and Cu can simultaneously down-regulate six immune check-points is a highly significant finding. In this context, we have recently reported that cfChPs released from dying cancer cells that circulate in human blood, or those that are released from dying cancer cells, can activate immune checkpoints in human lymphocytes both in vitro and in vivo [ 43 PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, NKG2A TIM-3 43 Our present results are consistent with those of our earlier exploratory study in advanced oral cancer which was primarily undertaken to determine the optimal dose for R and Cu [ 16 16 In summary, results of our study suggest that oral administration of a non-toxic combination of small quantities of the commonly used nutraceuticals R and Cu can have a profound effect in attenuating the aggressive phenotype of GBM. They also suggest that cfChPs are the key instigators of cancer hallmarks, immune checkpoints and cancer stemness in GBM. Whether R-Cu treatment might modify response to standard-of-care therapies like Temozolomide remains undetermined at present. Estimation of DNA repair pathways and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status should be considered in future studies. Further studies are also required to investigate whether prolonged treatment with R-Cu may induce the tumour to adopt a benign phenotype.
