Indeed, although guidelines have been developed, the management practices remain debatable for some tumors. The present survey highlights the controversies in fertility preservation for gynecological cancers and directs attention to knowledge gaps in these guidelines. Abstract Guidelines on fertility preservation (FP) have been developed to help young women preserve their fertility, which may have been impaired due to cancer. Nevertheless, the correct management of oncological patients of childbearing age remains controversial, especially regarding gynecological malignancies. For this reason, we explored the current knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practices of physicians towards the challenges of FP in this population. A specially developed questionnaire on fertility-related issues in patients with gynecological cancer was administered via email to 167 people, representing 167 centers of the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer and gynecologic malignancies (MITO) group. A total of 56 physicians, who represented 56 out of these 167 centers, responded to our survey (response rate: 33.5%). Approximately half of these physicians stated that they had adequate knowledge about the use of gonadotropin-releasing analog (GnRHa) injections (n = 30; 53.6%), the cryopreservation of oocytes (n = 25; 44.6%), and the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue (n = 27; 48.2%) in patients with gynecological tumors. Meanwhile, regarding (borderline) ovarian tumors, endometrial or cervical cancer, and genetic mutation carriers, attitudes varied substantially. In conclusion, the results of our survey highlight the different perspectives on controversial topics among physicians directly involved in the treatment of these tumors. These findings also demonstrate the lack of evidence on these issues to adequately counsel this specific patient population. fertility preservation controversies gynecological cancer survey This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The incidence rate of all cancers increased by 29% between 1973 and 2015 in adolescents and young adults of both sexes [ 1 2 3 4 Gynecological cancer directly affects fertility, as standard treatment consists of surgical removal of the reproductive organ and/or exposure to gonadotoxic treatment modalities. However, patients who present with early-stage gynecological cancer who meet strict criteria might be treated with fertility-sparing surgeries, thereby achieving oncological results equivalent to those undergoing traditional treatments [ 5 6 7 8 We decided to explore the current knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practices of physicians involved in the treatment of gynecological cancer towards the current controversies related to FP in young gynecological cancer patients. 2. Material and Methods A specially developed questionnaire on fertility issues in gynecologic cancer patients was administered by email to 167 representatives of 167 centers of the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer and gynecologic malignancies (MITO) group. The MITO group represents the most important Italian scientific society, in which gynecologic oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, or reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI) physicians are involved in 167 centers across the country. The survey was open for responses from 1 February 2023 to 30 July 2023. The email contained a link through which representatives could access the survey. The email address was not linked to the survey and no personal information was required. The entire process was anonymous. Characteristics of the Survey The questionnaire was approved by the MITO internal review board. It consisted of 53 items and was divided into 4 main sections—(1) sociodemographic information; (2) knowledge and availability of FP procedures; (3) attitudes about FP controversies in gynecological cancers; and (4) attitudes about controversies on artificial reproductive technologies and genetic issues. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods, calculating the absolute and percentage frequencies (N, %) for all qualitative variables. Statistics were calculated using SPSS version 27 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). 3. Results A total of 56 out of 167 MITO centers responded to our survey (response rate: 33.5%). Most respondents were women (64.3%). A total of 87.5% of respondents were Catholic and 53.6% of respondents were from northern Italy. The responding physicians were gynecologists (58.9%), followed by medical oncologists (33.9%), radiation oncologists (3.6%), and fertility specialists (3.6%). More than half of them (60.7%) worked in a Gynecological Oncology unit. Further details are displayed in Table 1 The vast majority of respondents (91.1%) reported consulting current national and international guidelines on FP in patients with cancer and/or cancer survivors on a regular basis. Only three respondents (5.4%) declared not to be aware of the availability of guidelines on this topic. 3.1. Knowledge About Fertility Preservation Techniques Approximately half of the physicians who participated in the survey stated that they had adequate knowledge about the use of gonadotropin-releasing analog (GnRHa) injections (n = 30; 53.6%), the cryopreservation of oocytes (n = 25; 44.6%), and the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue (n = 27; 48.2%). However, a total of 7 (12.5%), 10 (17.9%), and 14 (25.0%) respondents reported that they were aware of GnRHa, the cryopreservation of oocytes, and the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, respectively, but did not consider themselves well-informed ( Figure 1 The availability of the administration of GnRHa, oocyte cryopreservation, and ovarian tissue cryopreservation within the respondents’ work settings was 92.9%, 67.9%, and 44.6%, respectively ( Figure 2 Furthermore, respondents were asked to indicate what suggestions might help to improve FP services in cancer patients. The following items were considered valuable or highly valuable: the increment of patient awareness (n = 49; 87.5%), FP training for professionals involved in the treatment of cancer patients (n = 54; 96.4%), the role of specialized nurses (n = 43; 76.8%), the standard offering of onco-fertility consultations with a gynecologist for all women affected by cancer at reproductive age (n = 49; 87.5%), and agreement between departments on who is responsible for discussing FP in young patients with cancer (n = 51; 91.1%). Further details are displayed in Table 2 3.2. Artificial Reproduction Techniques Overall, 52 respondents (92.9%) agreed on the statement that the cryopreservation and autotransplantation of ovarian tissue must be performed exclusively in highly specialized referral centers. Furthermore, 31 of the respondents (55.3%) declared that the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue must be performed only in patients who have not yet been exposed to potentially gonadotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Contrasting opinions were found on the proposition that the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue should be limited to patients under the age of 35 years in order to increase the potential for the restoration of ovarian function at the time of the autotransplantation of frozen and thawed ovarian tissue fragments. Similarly, opinions were divided as to whether ovarian suppression with GnRH analogs should exclusively be offered to patients in whom the cryopreservation of oocytes or ovarian tissue is not considered feasible. Physicians’ attitudes towards controversies over artificial reproductive technologies are shown in Table 3 3.3. Fertility Preservation in Borderline Ovarian Tumors or Malignant Ovarian Tumors Physicians’ attitudes towards controversies on FP in gynecological cancers are shown in Table 4 A total of 38 respondents (67.8%) agreed on the option to perform controlled ovarian stimulation with subsequent oocyte cryopreservation in patients undergoing surgery for borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs). In contrast, only 19 (33.9%) of the respondents agreed on the proposition that the ovarian tissue cryopreservation of the normal-appearing contralateral ovary could be performed in patients undergoing unilateral adnexectomy because of BOTs. A total of 24 respondents (42.8%) were neutral or disagreed. A total of 33 respondents (58.9%) agreed on the statement that oocyte cryopreservation should be offered to women diagnosed with malignant ovarian germ cell tumors. Finally, 19 respondents (33.9%) would not consider FP in patients diagnosed with granulosa cell tumor with concomitant atypical endometrial hyperplasia. 3.4. Endometrial Cancer For patients with low-risk endometrial cancer who have had a complete histological response after progesterone therapy and who have not yet spontaneously become pregnant six months after progesterone treatment, 45 respondents (80.3%) believed these patients should be offered artificial reproductive technologies (e.g., in vitro fertilization) to increase fecundity. Furthermore, 27 respondents (48.2%) felt it is opportune to consider reinitiating progesterone treatment in patients with recurrent endometrial cancer who had a complete response after initial progesterone treatment and who had not yet completed their childbearing wishes. Nevertheless, a total of 13 (23.2%) and 12 (21.4%) respondents disagreed or were neutral, respectively, in attempting conservative treatment again. A substantial proportion of respondents (57.1%) stated that hysterectomy should always be performed after a fulfilled child wish in patients with a previous diagnosis of endometrial cancer, regardless of the histological response status following progesterone treatment. Furthermore, a total of 28 respondents (50.0%) agreed that conservative management can be considered in patients with grade 2 endometrial cancers without myometrial invasion. Finally, 31 respondents (55.2%) expressed disagreement or neutrality to the statement that oral progesterone or an intrauterine progesterone device is equally effective for conservative management in patients with endometrial tumors. 3.5. Cervical Cancer The majority of respondents (n = 36; 64.3%) felt that frozen sections on resected sentinel lymph nodes can be used as an intraoperative decision-making tool for FP in early-stage cervical cancers. In addition, 29 respondents (51.8%) agreed on administering neoadjuvant chemotherapy exclusively in patients participating in clinical trials with cervical tumors larger than 2 cm. Ovarian transposition and ovarian tissue autotransplantation were deemed safe in patients with cervical cancer with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) according to 27 respondents (48.2%). This was considerably higher as compared to those who remained neutral or expressed disagreement, at 26.8% and 21.4%, respectively. A total of 49 respondents (87.5%) agreed or were neutral on considering oocyte cryopreservation and/or ovarian transposition in cervical cancer patients in whom adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended after hysterectomy. Moreover, 20 respondents (35.7%) also considered uterine transplantation in patients undergoing radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer, while 15 respondents (26.8%) disagreed. 3.6. Genetic Issues Physicians’ attitudes towards controversies on genetic issues are shown in Table 5 Approximately 35 respondents (62.5%) believed that patients younger than 40 years of age at the time of primary diagnosis of endometrial cancer should be referred to a clinical geneticist, regardless of mismatch repair status. Prescribing progesterone treatment in patients with atypical endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer carrying genetic mutations associated with Lynch syndrome produced conflicting results. In fact, 20 survey participants (35.6%) did not agree with the use of these drugs, whereas 21 (37.5%) did not provide an answer. Many respondents (n = 39, 69.7%) agreed to always offer fertility cryopreservation in BRCA gene mutation carriers as these patients may have a reduced ovarian reserve. A substantial proportion of respondents believed that preimplantation genetic testing should be discussed with patients who harbor pathogenic BRCA mutation variants (n = 42, 75%), those who are diagnosed with Lynch syndrome in whom endometrial aberrations have not yet occurred (n = 38, 67.8%), and those who are known to have genetic variants in homologous recombination genes other than BRCA1 or BRCA2 (e.g., RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, etc.) (n = 36, 64.3%). On the other hand, the respondents’ perspectives on offering pre-implantation genetic testing to patients carrying BRCA genetic variants of unknown significance (VUSs) were less consistent, as follows: 22 (39.8%) agreed, 13 (23.2%) remained neutral, and 21 (37.5%) disagreed. Regarding ovarian tissue autotransplantation, 51.8% (n = 29) did not agree on the proposition that this procedure is safe in carriers of BRCA 4. Discussion This survey, conducted among MITO centers, highlighted the current landscape of awareness, attitudes, and practices in relation to FP among gynecologic oncology professionals in Italy. To our knowledge, this was the first survey to examine these aspects among physicians working in the gynecologic cancer field. Overall, our survey showed that physicians have divergent perspectives and approaches towards this topic. This is likely due to the relatively limited evidence available in the literature on FP in gynecologic cancer, which makes it difficult to provide unequivocal advice to gynecologic cancer patients who wish to preserve their fertility. A notable finding was the high proportion of respondents (91.1%) who reported regularly consulting national and international guidelines on FP in cancer patients and survivors. This was consistent with previous studies indicating that standardized guidelines are critical to ensure best practice in oncofertility care [ 9 4.1. Fertility Preservation Techniques A considerable proportion of respondents expressed uncertainty about FP techniques, in accordance with previous studies highlighting gaps in FP education among oncology professionals [ 10 11 Participants identified several key strategies to improve FP services, including increased patient awareness (87.5%) and FP training for professionals (96.4%). These findings were congruent with previous reports suggesting that educational interventions for both patients and providers improve FP decision-making [ 10 12 13 Considering ovarian tissue cryopreservation, respondents had opposing opinions with respect to patient selection criteria [ 14 15 16 17 4.2. Borderline Ovarian Tumors Considering gynecological tumors, BOTs represent a unique challenge due to their uncertain malignant potential. While fertility-sparing surgery is an option for many women with BOTs [ 18 19 20 4.3. Endometrial Cancer For women with early, low-grade endometrial cancer who wish to preserve fertility, hysteroscopic endometrial resection followed by hormonal treatment is often considered a viable option [ 21 22 23 24 8 4.4. Cervical Cancer Treatment of cervical cancer may require radical hysterectomy or chemoradiation, compromising a woman’s ability to carry a pregnancy to term [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 4.5. Genetic Issues About 30% of the respondents were not favorable to providing FP counseling to patients who carry a BRCA mutation. However, patients with BRCA mutations might have a higher risk of developing cancer and impaired fertility. For this reason, tailored oncofertility counseling should be provided to women at the time of BRCA mutation diagnosis [ 32 33 4.6. Limitations The current study has several limitations. First, the response rate among MITO representatives was relatively low. Second, the degree of knowledge was self-reported and we did not test the respondents’ experience. Finally, although we believe that the questionnaire comprehensively addressed the current controversies regarding FP in gynecological cancer, it was not officially validated for this purpose. In conclusion, our survey results demonstrated a wide variety of physicians’ perspectives, attitudes, and practices in relation to FP in young gynecological cancer patients. These findings emphasize the lack of evidence regarding many of these issues. In order to improve oncofertility counseling and adherence to available guidelines, training courses are urgently needed, as well as conducting research regarding the many gray areas in the field.
