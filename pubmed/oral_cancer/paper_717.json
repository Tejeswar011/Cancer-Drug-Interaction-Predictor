The factors known to influence vaccine efficacy include host genetics, age, and bacterial microbiota, while the virome is a much less considered fourth dimension. This article reviews how components of the virome such as Torque Teno Virus (TTV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and bacteriophages impact both innate and adaptive immune responses, including mechanisms of immune pre-activation, trained immunity, and molecular mimicry from both beneficial and detrimental perspectives for vaccine-induced immunization. Emphasis is given to immunocompromised populations such as transplant recipients and those with HIV, where virome composition has been shown to correlate with vaccine responsiveness. Experimental models support clinical observations on how chronic viral exposures can either enhance or inhibit vaccine efficacy. Finally, we discuss virome-aware precision vaccinology and call for the integration of the virome in the development of immunization strategies, thus improving outcomes through customization. human virome vaccine-induced immunization immune response Torque Teno Virus (TTV) herpesvirus This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Vaccines elicit protective immune responses, but the magnitude and durability of this immunity can vary widely between individuals. While factors such as age, genetics, and the bacterial microbiome are known to impact vaccine efficacy [ 1 2 3 This review explores how the virome modulates vaccine-induced immunity. We integrate findings from human clinical studies and experimental models to examine both beneficial and detrimental effects of the virome. Key clinical contexts, such as vaccine responses in transplant recipients and immunocompromised hosts, are considered, alongside mechanistic insights into viral modulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Finally, we discuss future perspectives, including how virome profiling could enhance precision vaccinology. 2. Historical Overview: From the Microbiome to the Virome Microbiome refers to the combined genomes of all microorganisms found in a specific environment, such as bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. In 2001, Joshua Lederberg originally defined the microbiome, and since then, it has changed some fields of immunology by showing how the resident microbial communities shape immune development, regulate tolerance, and modulate inflammatory responses. With very few exceptions, the microbiota’s bacterial constituents have been under constant investigation, whereas the viral component—the virome by definition—has recently emerged under the spotlight, rather fortuitously, following the advent of high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analyses [ 4 5 The human virome encompasses all viruses associated with the human body, including eukaryotic viruses that infect human cells, bacteriophages that infect the bacterial microbiota, and endogenous viral elements embedded within the human genome. These viruses could be pathogenic, commensal, or latent, with viral activity often countering symptoms rather than causing them for a long time in some anatomical niches. Over 200 viruses have been characterized as being able to infect humans; however, few of these viruses are implicated in the diseases of immunocompromised individuals [ 6 Figure 1 Many viral families are associated with good health: anelloviruses, such as the Torque Teno Virus, are small circular ssDNA viruses found everywhere in blood and tissues, considered mostly non-pathogenic and sometimes used as surrogate markers of immune competence [ 7 8 9 10 The modes of replication and persistence vary from one virus to another. Herpesviruses reside latently in lymphoid or neural tissues; anelloviruses replicate in the peripheral blood; polyomaviruses are found in the renal epithelium; while bacteriophages are mainly found in the gut lumen and mucus layer. Redondoviruses are highly abundant in the upper respiratory tract. The human body is home to upwards of 10 12 13 6 The opportunities for pathogenic activity for viruses exist on this spectrum. Some viruses are pathogenic, while others quietly persist, causing no harm to the host under conditions of homeostasis and maybe even contributing to immune education. Exposure to low levels of virus continuously stimulates innate immune receptors, altering cytokine production and influencing immune cell maturation, thus suggesting the virome is not simply an innocent bystander but, instead, is interacting in the modulation of immune tone and perhaps even vaccine responsiveness. Knowledge about what viruses persist in which anatomical locations and how their presence interacts with the dynamics of the immune system will help in the appreciation of the fine-tuned mechanistic interplay between host, microbiota, and immune function. The more we learn about the virome, the clearer it is that it sets the tone for immune maturation and responses to immunological perturbations, such as vaccination. A summary of the major viral families identified in the human virome, their genomic characteristics, anatomical niches, and classification as commensal or pathogenic is presented in Table 1 While the virome is generally accepted as referring to those viruses with long histories of being residents, acute viral infections may allow some viruses, under certain conditions, to persist. For example, some RNA viruses have shown the ability to persist at low levels in immune-privileged sites or under situations of chronic immune activation. The presence of persistent viral RNA or proteins can contribute to long-term immune modulation, epigenetic alteration, and modified cytokine profiles, even if there is no complete replication or production of infectious progeny [ 12 13 3. Virome-Mediated Modulation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity The human body is host to a vast array of viruses, the majority of which do not manifest as overt disease [ 2 14 15 15 16 17 Listeria monocytogenes 18 19 Conversely, the virome’s influence can be double-edged. Persistent viruses have evolved immune evasion strategies to avoid clearance, and their presence can drive chronic immune activation or immune subset skewing. In the event of waning immune surveillance by the host, for instance, during immunosuppression, commensal viruses have the potential to replicate unchecked, thereby potentially exacerbating the severity of an underlying pathology [ 20 + 20 21 22 Beyond their distinctive roles in immunity, virome components differ fundamentally in their scope of influence on the host organism. The modulation of the bacterial microbiome structure and activity by bacteriophage lysis of bacterial species and gene expression interactions, which can also contribute to horizontal gene transfer, shapes dynamics through microbial diversity and stability effects on digestion, metabolism, and mucosal immunity [ 23 6 24 25 Over the last years, vaccinology has facilitated the use of biological tools to study immune responses to vaccination [ 26 27 28 The virome exerts a profound influence on the immune response to vaccines, encompassing both innate and adaptive immunity, in addition to epigenetic and indirect mechanisms that are sustained by the bacterial microbiota. This concept has recently been the focus of debate, with particular attention being directed towards the potential involvement of the virome in modifying vaccine responses. This involves stimulation of innate immunity receptors, the development of cytokines such as IFN and IL-6, as well as IL-10, and the induction of trained immunity, especially in susceptible subjects [ 29 The immune activation state is characterized by its chronic nature, manifesting as a low-grade and continuous process induced by several viruses residing within the virome. These include latent or persistent forms, such as cytomegalovirus or human Herpes virus 4. The process may involve a preliminary activation of different cell type, such as dendritic and natural killer cells, and macrophages, thereby enhancing their ability to respond to novel antigen presentation, for instance, vaccine antigens [ 30 31 32 32 33 The mechanism is illustrated in Figure 2 In mice, NLRP6 has been observed to engage DHX15-helicase upon binding to viral RNA. This interaction facilitates the binding of the NLRP6 inflammasome to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein complex, thereby triggering the release of IFN-α/β and IFN-γ. Consequently, this process serves to inhibit the replication of various viruses, including encephalomyocarditis and the norovirus [ 34 35 The virome also defines the activation and differentiation of T and B lymphocytes along the axis of adaptive immunity. It has been observed that viruses shift the activation direction towards the Th1 phenotype, thereby triggering pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ. Conversely, other viruses have been observed to promote the generation of Tregs, which possess the capacity to suppress immune activity, thus exerting a negative effect on vaccine responses [ 32 This is another level of regulation, referred to as trained immunity. Consequently, chronic exposure to latent viruses is associated with epigenetic changes (for example, DNA methylation, histone modification) in myeloid progenitors, resulting in a continuous predisposition to respond more vigorously to subsequent stimuli, including vaccine antigens. This mechanism, while not antigen-specific, has the potential to enhance the responsiveness to subsequent vaccinations [ 36 Finally, the virome also acts indirectly through modulation of the microbiota. For example, bacteriophages affect intestinal bacterial composition, as well as key metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are implicated in the maturation of regulatory T cells. Some phages have been observed to directly stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-c, independently of bacteria, thus demonstrating of autonomous immunomodulatory potential [ 5 A second mechanism is molecular mimicry, whereby certain viral proteins exhibit structural homology with the vaccine antigens, potentially generating cross-reactions. These cross-reactions could be advantageous, favoring the process of “pre-immunization”, or conversely, they could lead to the induction of tolerance or immune exhaustion [ 26 Molecular mimicry has been demonstrated to elicit an immune response, which may either lead to anticipation and enhancement of immunization, or to the development of immune tolerance or lymphocyte exhaustion. This phenomenon has been exemplified in African pediatric populations, where exposure to some enteric viruses has been linked to impaired responses to oral rotavirus vaccines [ 37 Li et al. have dealt with this mimicry between the commensal viruses and the exogenous antigens that can change the antigenic presentation by dendritic cells, thus directing the activation of lymphocytes to the regulatory phenotypes [ 32 Tolerogenic activation can also be compartmentalized at the mucosal level, as noted by Cadwell et al., which would explain the differences in the efficacy of the same vaccine in different individuals, depending on their resident virome [ 38 Several recent studies have indicated that prior exposure to certain viruses can epigenetically reprogram cells of innate immunity, termed “trained immunity”. Nonspecific memory may elicit more rapid or even, in certain instances, subdued responses to future stimuli, which may include vaccines [ 36 An illustration of the viroma’s effect on vaccination has been shown by a longitudinal study on 122 Ghanaian children vaccinated with Rotarix (RVV), which shows evidence of a negative correlation between gut bacteriophage diversity and post-vaccine seroconversion. The presence of Enterovirus B and cosaviruses in some subjects was also associated with a reduced immune response [ 37 It is important to note that phages (bacteria viruses) can compromise the efficacy of vaccines. This can occur either through changes in the composition of the microbiota or through direct modulation of the immune system, for example, by stimulating IFN-γ production even in the absence of bacteria [ 39 Several reports suggest that the virome, particularly the intestinal virome, may represent an important immunomodulatory factor concerning vaccine responses. In certain conditions, it enhances the immunogenicity, while in others, it has been observed to diminish it, as evidenced by data on subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 that have exhibited significant alterations in their intestinal viral composition [ 5 40 41 Molecular mimicry is another strategy through which the virome can manipulate immune responses to vaccines. Some proteins present in the viral agents are structurally like the vaccine antigens or those of the host, hence leading the immune system into cross-reactive responses, which may be beneficial, for example, by training the immune system before vaccination, or detrimental, by leading to immune tolerance or functional exhaustion [ 42 42 Such dynamics are built into plans for personalized vaccine strategies regarding individual virome composition and virome–microbiota–immune system interactions. Before examining the role of major viroma viruses in the vaccine response, Table 2 Evidence from both observational and experimental studies suggests that an individual’s virome composition likely influences both the quantity and quality of vaccine-induced immune responses. Some viruses, such as CMV and EBV, are considered persistent in the host and alter immune memory, thereby promoting the expansion of T-cell subsets and subverting cytokine profiles through chronic stimulation with antigens [ 44 10 58 45 59 The hypothesized mechanisms through which the virome may modulate vaccine-induced immunity are illustrated in Figure 3 4. Torque Teno Virus: A Sentinel of Immune Status TTV, a ubiquitous member of the Anelloviridae family, is one of the most abundant components of the human virome, with infection rates exceeding 90% globally and often acquired early in life [ 60 Figure 4 Although traditionally considered apathogenic, TTV is now gaining attention as a non-invasive biomarker of immune competence—a so-called “gentle spy” of the immune system [ 46 4 61 48 62 Beyond passive monitoring, TTV appears to interact directly with immune pathways. The viral ORF2 protein has been shown to suppress NF-κB signaling, dampening pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-8 [ 47 54 47 50 63 This dynamic interaction naturally raises questions about TTV’s influence on vaccine-induced immunity. Growing clinical evidence suggests that high TTV loads correlate with poor vaccine responsiveness, particularly in immunosuppressed populations. For example, kidney transplant recipients with TTV levels above ~10 6 64 65 66 61 22 51 5. Latent Herpesviruses and Immune Modulation of Vaccination Latent herpesviruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), constitute a stable and influential part of the human virome. A schematic overview of latent human herpesviruses, their sites of persistence, immune evasion strategies, and potential implications for vaccine responses is provided in Figure 5 Unlike TTV, herpesviruses are not considered harmless: they can cause overt disease under certain circumstances, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Even in immunocompetent hosts, however, they persist subclinically, and continuously shape immune architecture. CMV, in particular, has emerged as a major driver of immune remodeling and immunosenescence [ 52 By early adulthood, approximately 50–70% of individuals are CMV-seropositive. Over time, CMV induces a significant expansion of CMV-specific T cells, which may comprise up to 30% of memory CD4 + + 67 68 + + 53 Most data have focused on CMV, especially in the context of vaccines for the elderly. Studies consistently demonstrate that CMV-seropositive older adults tend to mount weaker humoral responses to flu vaccines than CMV-negative counterparts [ 52 67 69 Beyond influenza, CMV-seropositivity has been associated with impaired responses to other vaccines. In young adults receiving experimental Ebola vaccines, CMV-seropositive individuals showed significantly lower glycoprotein-specific antibody titers and a higher proportion of terminally differentiated T cells (CD57 + + 54 56 57 This paradox suggests that CMV’s effects may depend on the underlying inflammatory or metabolic milieu. Some have speculated that, under certain contexts, CMV’s immune stimulation could function as an adjuvant, whereas in other contexts, it may predominate as an immune sink that diverts resources. This hypothesis still remains to be explored [ 70 Interventional evidence further strengthens the case for a causal role. A 2022 clinical trial in CMV-positive patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis showed that those receiving antiviral prophylaxis (valacyclovir) had fewer CMV reactivations and mounted stronger immune responses to a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) compared to a placebo [ 71 The role of EBV in modulating vaccine response is less well understood. While EBV latency alters the B-cell compartment and is associated with chronic immune activation, direct evidence linking EBV to poor vaccine outcomes remains limited. However, in co-infection settings—such as CMV + EBV or EBV + HIV—interactions may exacerbate immune dysfunction, particularly in transplant patients or infants with congenital infections [ 68 72 73 74 + 68 Insights suggest several pathways through which CMV may impair vaccine responses. These include the following: (1) ”Immune space” competition, where CMV-specific T-cell clones dominate the repertoire, reducing the availability of naïve T cells for novel antigens [ 75 76 77 78 In summary, latent herpesviruses—especially CMV—act as subtle yet powerful modulators of immune readiness. Their effects may vary depending on host age, immune status, comorbidities, and the specific vaccine in question. While in some contexts CMV-induced immune stimulation may paradoxically enhance vaccine responses, the predominant effect appears to be immunological “distraction” or exhaustion. Emerging data suggest that targeted virome modulation—through antivirals or future vaccines—could become a viable strategy to enhance vaccine efficacy in immunologically vulnerable populations. 6. Other Commensal Viruses and Vaccine Responses Although TTV and CMV have attracted significant research regarding their potential role in immune modulation and vaccine responsiveness, they still represent only a small portion of the human virome. This virome may also play a crucial role in modulating immune responses following immunization. Several other chronic or persistent viral infections, mostly neglected, may also meaningfully impact vaccine efficacy. Polyomaviruses, such as the BK/JC, are known to remain latent in renal and other tissues. In immunocompromised hosts, especially organ transplant recipients, BK virus reactivation is common and could lead to complications such as polyomavirus-associated nephropathy [ 43 58 Chronic hepatitis B and C are states of continuous immune activation and dysfunction, especially within the hepatic microenvironment. For example, untreated hepatitis C infection is often associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines and immune exhaustion features [ 79 80 An interesting example is that of Human Pegivirus (HPgV). This RNA virus is usually non-pathogenic, but it can alter immune responses in co-infected individuals. In HIV-infected patients, HPgV infection appears to slow disease progression and improve survival, likely through immunomodulation [ 81 82 Aside from those already mentioned, the gut virome represents an enormously large and dynamic ecosystem, primarily populated by bacteriophages, and sporadically interspersed with persistent eukaryotic viruses such as enteroviruses or noroviruses. Bacteriophages may indirectly affect immune homeostasis by modulating the composition of the bacterial microbiota [ 83 84 85 Similarly, the respiratory tract virome, which includes latent adenoviruses, anelloviruses, and endogenous retroviral elements, is emerging as another component of mucosal immunity. Altered respiratory virome composition has been observed in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are often associated with inflammation or disease exacerbation [ 84 In conclusion, the human virome, ranging from primarily well-known viruses like CMV and hepatitis C to obscure agents like pegiviruses or bacteriophages, represents a rich and largely untapped dimension for immune regulation. Recent advances in metagenomic sequencing have revealed new viruses, such as redondoviruses from the respiratory tract [ 9 7. Bacteriophage-Based Vaccines and Their Immunogenic Potential One field that is constantly progressing in personalized medicine is phageomics, which is concerned with the study of bacteriophage genetic material. Phageomics holds promise for addressing the global issue of antimicrobial resistance by providing easier alternatives to antibiotics [ 86 As phages also have the potential to be used use in vaccination, there is growing interest among researchers in their possible benefits. Similar to the key objectives of effective vaccine strategies, phages can induce both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Phage-based vaccines use bacteriophages as delivery vehicles to target the immune system with antigens, aiming to initiate an immune response that protects against a particular disease [ 87 88 89 The major drawbacks of DNA vaccines, such as poor immunogenicity and dependence on adjuvants, can be overcome using bacteriophage-based DNA vaccines. This can be achieved by providing delivery vectors [ 90 91 The most common lambda phages are designed for filamentous phage application [ 92 92 93 94 Considering the unique property of single-stranded RNA bacteriophages to act as antigen carriers, RNA phages have emerged as a candidate at the frontier of vaccine design. Due to their simple genome and rapid replication within their bacterial hosts, phages can be manipulated to hold RNA sequences that encode for specific antigens. The use of RNA phages in vaccine formulation enables the harnessing of both the rapid adaptability of RNA-based technologies and the intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of phages. Phages effectively present poorly immunogenic epitopes, generating a broad immune response that incorporates both humoral and cellular immunity [ 95 96 97 Moreover, phages have intrinsic adjuvant activity, allowing them to elicit innate immunity. They can activate TLRs and other PRRs, which are essential for antigen presentation and cytokine production. The success of phage-based vaccines relies on this adjuvant effect. Several studies highlight the potential of phages as adjuvants for vaccines [ 98 99 Phage-based vaccines have an outstanding intrinsic advantage: they do not infect human cells and, therefore, cannot cause disease or dangerous cell transformations [ 55 88 Another advantage is their ability to activate both humoral and cellular immunity, often without the need of adjuvants. Some studies have shown that phages can amplify immune responses by promoting the release of cytokines and T-cell activation [ 100 101 However, there are several downsides as well. One common issue is the difficulty in properly displaying antigens at the phage surface, especially when the antigens are large or complex proteins. This decreases the immunological efficacy of the vaccine. Strategies used to overcome this issue include chemical conjugation or dual-display vectors [ 102 Additionally, lipopolysaccharide contaminants associated with endotoxins, which are residues from bacterial production, must be sufficiently removed to prevent adverse reactions. Further preclinical studies are needed to understand how lytic phages affect gut microbiota when taken orally [ 103 104 Despite promising results in animal models and early clinical phases, these vaccines must overcome many regulatory obstacles before they gain approval for use and can be applied on a large scale. Currently, indeed, there are very few large clinical trials underway to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and industrial standardization of such vaccines. Considering their fantastic preclinical efficacies and versatility for use in humans, phage-based vaccines are still in the experimental phase. Only a few studies have reached early-phase trials with human patients, while the majority remain preclinical, primarily on animal models. Nevertheless, the different applications and demands for different vaccine platforms continue to advance research in multiple areas. For example, a phage-based vaccine has been developed against the zoonotic bacterium Brucella abortus. This filamentous M13 bacteriophage was engineered to express Brucella antigens and was shown to induce a Th1-type immune response in murine models [ 105 106 Recently, however, research has also focused on using phages against SARS-CoV-2. An experimental RNA-phage platform delivering engineered phages presenting spike protein epitopes was proposed and showed promising immunogenic responses during initial animal trials of testing [ 107 In addition to infectious diseases, phage-based cancer vaccines are also regarded as an emerging area of interest. For instance, M13 phages displaying tumor-specific neoantigens have been assessed in mouse melanoma models, where they promoted both antigen-specific T-cell responses and tumor regression [ 108 These studies demonstrate the advantages of phage vaccines in terms of production and safety, including very high stability, low production costs, and replication failure in human cells. Nevertheless, challenges remain in standardizing manufacturing processes, eliminating endotoxins, and meeting regulatory standard requirements for clinical approval. Table 3 8. Clinical Implications: Transplant and Immunocompromised Patients It is especially critical to understand the impact of the virome on vaccine efficacy, particularly for populations with compromised immune systems. Transplant patients and immunocompromised hosts frequently exhibit suboptimal vaccine responses and thus represent a vulnerable population with a high need for protection. In these subjects, the impact of the virome is intensified, resulting in significant clinical manifestation. Solid-organ transplant patients are maintained on immunosuppressive medications in order to prevent graft rejection, which in turn suppresses their adaptive immune responses. As is well documented, recipients of organ transplant exhibit substandard responses to conventional vaccinations [ 109 61 61 110 111 112 Immunocompromised hosts exhibit a wide spectrum of health conditions, ranging from subjects undergoing chemotherapy or biologic immunosuppressant treatment, to those afflicted with primary immunodeficiencies, and even PLWH, among others. Each of these scenarios presents a unique set of virome interactions. For instance, patients with certain primary immune deficiencies are susceptible to chronic norovirus or enterovirus infections. These ongoing infections can lead to immune exhaustion and inflammation, which may impair the body’s ability to responds to new vaccines. In such cases, some live vaccines are contraindicated entirely. In oncology patients receiving chemotherapy, reactivation of herpesviruses (CMV, varicella zoster virus) is prevalent and can lead to complications. Clinicians sometimes administer prophylactic acyclovir/valacyclovir which, intriguingly, may also indirectly enhance these patients’ capacity to respond to vaccines administered during chemotherapy. This phenomenon, although not extensively studied, shares a conceptual similarity with the vasculitis trial previously mentioned. In subjects with HIV, the primary treatment is antiretroviral therapy to control HIV virus. However, even patients who have been treated for HIV often experience residual immune dysfunction and an expanded virome. According to the findings of studies such as that of Royston et al., the presence of untreated HIV has been shown to result in virome expansion [ 68 68 In clinical practice, these insights are leading to substantial changes. Vaccine guidelines for immunocompromised patients have evolved to acknowledge the heterogeneity of this population of patients, recognizing that a universal approach to vaccination is not applicable in this group. For instance, individuals undergoing organ transplant currently receive an intensified for SARS-CoV-2 virus. This entails the administration of three primary doses of the vaccine, instead of the previous two, in addition to the administration of booster shots. The rationale for this adjustment is that their virome and the status of their immunosuppression have been demonstrated to hinder the response to the vaccine [ 61 Overall, acknowledging the virome as both an ally and adversary in the field of vaccinology can assist clinicians better in more effectively protect immunocompromised individuals. By monitoring silent viral partners such as TTV or CMV, we gain insights into the immune readiness of our patients. By mitigating the negative impacts of these viruses through the administration of antivirals, the modification of vaccine formulations, or the strategic timing of vaccinations, it is possible to improve the efficacy of vaccine-based interventions. This is crucial for individuals who are most reliant on vaccines to prevent illness. A substantial proportion of the knowledge on the role of the virome in immune modulation comes from experimental studies employing animal models and in vitro systems, which allow the investigation of cause-and-effect relationships under controlled conditions. Mice provide a suitable model system to investigate the impact of chronic viral infections on immune responses to vaccination. Pioneering work using murine CMV (MCMV) infection in mice demonstrated parallels to human CMV: MCMV establishes life-long infection and causes a significant expansion of certain T-cell populations in the mouse. Researchers have shown that MCMV-infected mice exhibit impaired immune responses to new vaccines or pathogens introduced subsequently. For instance, Cicin-Sain et al. [ 75 + 75 113 Conversely, mouse models have demonstrated the beneficial aspects of a virome. The murine norovirus (MNoV) model is instructive in this regard. MNoV can establish a persistent infection in the gastrointestinal tract of mice, which is predominantly asymptomatic, particularly in immunocompetent hosts. In germ-free mice, which are deficient in microbes, the immune system is underdeveloped. These mice have reduced gut lymphocyte numbers and low IgA levels, among other immune system deficiencies. Interestingly, colonization of germ-free mice with an MNoV strain restored many immune deficiencies, thereby compensating for the absence of bacteria [ 114 114 18 16 18 Humanized mice are a type of mouse model in which human immune cells or tissues are engrafted, thereby enabling the study of certain human viruses in vivo. For instance, humanized mice have been shown to support latent EBV or CMV infection [ 115 116 117 118 Co-culture experiments allow the dissection of molecular mechanisms. For example, in order to comprehend TTV’s immunomodulation, researchers have incorporated synthetic TTV DNA into cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and observed the occurrence of TLR9-dependent induction of interferon-alpha. The TTV ORF2 gene has been found to have a significant impact on NF-κB signaling in a human cell line, as confirmed through the use of transfected cells [ 49 119 120 In summary, experimental models provide substantial support for clinical observations and offer a mechanistic basis for understanding the impact of chronic viruses on vaccine responses. These models demonstrate that chronic viruses can impede vaccine responses by reducing naive cell pools, causing exhaustion, or altering innate signals. Conversely, certain commensal viruses have been observed to support immunity by providing tonic stimulation that function as an adjuvant. The challenge lies in tearing apart these effects and the subsequent determination of how to accentuate the positive, while mitigating the negative in a real-world setting. 9. Future Perspectives: Virome-Aware Precision Vaccinology As vaccine science advances towards precision immunization—where schedules and formulations are tailored to the unique biology of each person—the integration of an individual’s virome into this paradigm represents a compelling frontier. In the future, vaccine protocols and viromic profiling, which is analogous to host genotyping or microbiome sequencing, may become a routine part of pre-vaccination assessment. A patient’s plasma TTV load can be measured in conjunction with their serostatus for latent viruses, such as CMV and EBV. Those with a “noisy” virome—defined as elevated TTV levels or a positive CMV test result—may be identified as having a high likelihood of suboptimal response. Consequently, they may receive a regimen that incorporates enhanced adjuvants, additional booster doses, or vaccination scheduled during periods of reduced viral activity. Conversely, individuals with minimal latent viral load could follow standard vaccine protocols with expected efficacy. The application of virome-derived biomarkers in clinical trial design, such as stratification or subgroup analyses of clinical trials, is a potential avenue for future research. One specific area of interest is the comparison of vaccine efficacy between CMV-positive and CMV-negative participants [ 121 122 The development of vaccines targeting chronic virome members themselves, such as CMV, EBV, or even engineered benign phages, holds significant potential. These vaccines could potentially alleviate the immunologically noisy background conditions, thereby enhancing the efficacy of other vaccines. To illustrate, the implementation of childhood vaccination for CMV has the potential to enhance vaccine responses among the elderly by removing a primary driver of immunosenescence. The efficacy of immune recovery in non-related contexts has already been confirmed with curative infections for hepatitis B and C [ 123 The integration of big data and machine learning has been identified as a key enabler, facilitating the acceleration of these projects along their respective trajectories. As immunization programs increasingly collect multi-omic data, including virome composition, algorithms may reveal predictive patterns. For instance, a positive correlation has been observed between CMV+EBV+TTV being high with poor CD8 but normal B-cell responses, suggesting the potential for the development of a virome risk score to predict suboptimal vaccine outcomes [ 124 125 Furthermore, vaccination may be exerting an indirect influence on the composition of the virome. The enhancement of antiviral efficacy through excavation would consequently mirror real-time measurements, as opposed to merely evaluating antibody titer, extending beyond that scope to encompass the suppression of chronic viruses such as TTV. Initial reports, such as those describing transitory interferon and NK cell activation following influenza vaccination, are suggestive of this feedback loop. Therefore, virome shifts might provide a new readout of overall antiviral immunity engendered by the vaccine [ 126 In summary, the future of vaccinology can be conceptualized as a holistic perspective, wherein everyone’s silent viral co-inhabitants are mapped, monitored, and modulated alongside the delivery of vaccines. This approach, which has been derived from collaborations between vaccinologists, virologists, immunologists, and data scientists, may eventually hold promise in bringing personalized, highly effective vaccines to reality. 10. Conclusions Recently, the influence of the virome on human biology has gained recognition. Not only does it shape the innate immune response but it also adapts immune responses, according to which it is increasingly becoming a fingerprint of the efficacy of vaccines against viruses. Yet, these connections, largely presented as correlative observations, require much further research into causal and possible mechanistic pathways. Even if many experimental models are informative, they leave much to be desired regarding human systems. Others may suggest that the diversity and dynamics of what constitutes someone’s virome vary across population groups. Nevertheless, the integration of virome-related data into vaccinology is expected to open new avenues for personalized and increasingly effective immunization strategies. There is a need for ongoing multidisciplinary research, which is critical for accelerating the translation of these results into viable public health interventions.

The figure illustrates the main sources of viral acquisition during the different stages of life and the dominant immunologic profiles in each phase. In infancy, innate immunity is the primary defense before the acquisition of maternal/environmental viromes. During childhood, virome diversity expands and adaptive immunity develops, leading to the establishment of initial immune memory. In adulthood, the virome reaches a steady state, but it remains immunologically active. Reactivation of latent viruses in old age may take place due to immunosenescence and chronic low-grade inflammation (“inflammaging”). (Created with BioRender.com.) Figure 2 Proposed mechanisms through which the human virome modulates innate and adaptive immunity to vaccines. Persistent or latent viral components (e.g., Torque Teno Virus, cytomegalovirus, noroviruses) activate pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9), RIG-I-like receptors, and inflammasomes (e.g., NLRP6, NLRP9b). The stimulation causes intracellular signaling cascades to trigger NF-κB activation and production of antiviral interferons (type I and III IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF), and regulatory cytokines (IL-10). These immune mediators regulate dendritic cells, natural killers, macrophages, and T and B lymphocytes, thereby shaping vaccine-induced immune responses. The illustration describes the double function of virome-mediated modulation: firstly, in favor of immunogenicity through pre-activation of immune processes (“training” immunity) and, secondly, potentially inducing tolerance, immune exhaustion, or blunted responses. The balance depicted is the dynamic equilibrium between stimulatory and controlling signals coordinated by the virome. Abbreviations: TLR, Toll-like receptor; NLR, NOD-like receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. (Created with BioRender.com.) Figure 3 Schematic representation of the speculative role of an individual’s pre-vaccination virome composition in shaping vaccine-induced immune responses. The left panel represents the diversity of virome components—commensal viruses, latent viruses (e.g., herpesviruses, Torque Teno Virus), and acute infections—differing in abundance, diversity, and strain-specific features. The central panel explains the principal intrinsic immune-sensing pathways activated by viral elements, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors, and the cGAS-STING pathway, that converge on intracellular transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB. These pathways trigger the release of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines. The right panel shows how such pre-existing immune conditions driven by the virome can modulate the vaccines’ immunogenicity to enhance, leave untouched, or diminish responses. The figure highlights the bidirectionality of virome–vaccine interactions: pre-activation may function as a natural adjuvant, while excessive immune noise or tolerance can suppress responsiveness to vaccines. Abbreviations: TLR, Toll-like receptor; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; cGAS, cyclic GMP–AMP synthase; STING, stimulator of interferon genes. (Created with BioRender.com.) Figure 4 Schematic summary of Torque Teno Virus (TTV) biology, immune modulation mechanisms, and potential implications for vaccine responsiveness. ( A B C D Figure 5 Summary of latent human herpesviruses (α, β, and γ subfamilies), their main sites of latency, immune evasion mechanisms, and potential implications for vaccination. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is latent in endothelial cells and monocytes, inducing chronic T-cell activation, expansion of senescent T-cell clones, and low-grade inflammation, which can impair vaccine responses, particularly in immunocompromised and aged subjects. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infects B cells latently, regulating humoral immunity and possibly suppressing vaccine-induced memory. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is latent in lymphocytes and neural tissues, with emerging evidence of effects on HBV and polio vaccine responses. The principal immune evasion strategies include MHC molecule downregulation, blocking interferon signaling, and promotion of exhausted or terminally differentiated lymphocyte populations. The illustration points to the two-faced nature of herpesviruses: in some situations, they act as immune adjuvants through chronic stimulation, but more often as inducers of immunosenescence and reduced responsiveness to vaccine. Abbreviations: CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein–Barr virus; HHV-6, human herpesvirus 6; HBV, hepatitis B virus; MHC, major histocompatibility complex. vaccines-13-00895-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Viral families in the human virome are classified by genomic type and their main anatomical locations of persistence or replication. They are also characterized as either commensal or pathogenic. The table highlights that some virome members can exhibit lifelong persistence in certain niches such as the bloodstream, lymphoid organs, neuronal or renal cells, and the gastrointestinal tract. In non-pathogenic situations, these viruses may help promote immune homeostasis. However, they can induce pathogenic effects in immunocompromised hosts. For example, Anelloviridae are predominantly non-pathogenic and may serve as markers for immune competence. In contrast, Herpesviridae and Polyomaviridae establish latency and may cause disease when the immune system is suppressed. Bacteriophages do not infect human cells directly, but they influence immunity by controlling the activity and organization of the bacterial microbiota. Abbreviations: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; CNS, central nervous system. References are to the key studies mentioned in the text.

The table summarizes the viral family, genomic features, epidemiological prevalence, and characterized or hypothetical functions in vaccine response-related immunomodulation. Torque Teno Virus (TTV) is characterized as a marker of immune competence surrogate, with high viral load associated with poor responses to vaccination in transplant recipients and HIV-infected patients. Herpesviridae members such as CMV and EBV, by lifelong latency and immune remodeling, can alter T- and B-cell dynamics and therefore affect vaccine efficacy. Polyomaviruses (BK/JC) are indicators of immunosuppression under transplantation, while pegiviruses (GBV-C) could be protective immunomodulators in co-infected individuals. Noroviruses and γ-herpesviruses in mouse models illustrate the pre-conditioning of immune responses by chronic viral infections to boost or limit vaccine efficacy. Bacteriophages are highlighted as indirect controllers, modulating vaccine responses through microbiome modulation and metabolite secretion.

The table demonstrates the versatility of phages as antigen carriers for use against infectious diseases (e.g., Brucella abortus, influenza, SARS-CoV-2) and cancer immunotherapy (neoantigen-presenting phages). Display vaccines rely on the expression or chemical conjugation of antigenic peptides on phage surfaces, while DNA and RNA phage vaccines are delivery vectors with intrinsic potent adjuvant function. Examples include M13 phages expressing Brucella antigens, eliciting Th1 responses in mice; filamentous phages as vectors for influenza DNA vaccines; RNA phages bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike epitopes; and phage display vaccines against melanoma neoantigens. These early and preclinical studies demonstrate the theoretical advantages of phage vaccines—cost, stability, capacity to induce humoral and cellular immunity, and safety due to inability to replicate in human cells—while identifying key limitations with regard to endotoxin contamination, horizontal gene transfer risks, and manufacturing standardization.
