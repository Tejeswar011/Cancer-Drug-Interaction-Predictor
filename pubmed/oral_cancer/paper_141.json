The purpose of this work was to explore graviola extract and its nano-platform’s effects on tongue carcinoma (SCC154 cells) in vitro model. Methods Graviola leaves extract (GLE) was isolated, and its phenolic content was identified. Three nano-formulations (F1-F3) were optimized for GLE delivery, with F1 chosen for its optimal size and stability to synthesize graviola nanoparticles (GNPs). SCC154 cells were split into three groups: group Ι (untreated SCC154 cells), group ΙΙ: SCC154 cells + ethanolic GLE, and group ΙΙΙ: SCC154 cells + GLE encapsulated in a nano-void delivery system (GNPs). In vitro tests assessed cell viability via MTT assay, cell cycle, and apoptosis by flow cytometry, DNA damage using comet assay, and gene expression of the key molecular markers (PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and GSK-3β) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transmission electron microscopic examination of cells was also performed. Results GLE and GNPs reduced SCC154 cells’ proliferation compared to untreated cells, with GNPs showing significantly higher cytotoxicity. Both treatments also induced apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle, and caused DNA damage with a significant pronounced effect in the GNPs-treated group. Gene expression analysis revealed a substantial decline in PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and GSK-3β in both treated groups relative to the control group, with a significant downregulation in the GNPs-treated group. Ultrastructural examination revealed severe destruction in tongue carcinoma cells of both treated groups, with substantial damage in the GNPs-treated group. Conclusion GNPs showed a better impact than GLE in tongue carcinoma therapy, causing cytotoxicity and apoptosis, potentially through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

Dysregulation of this pathway is a hallmark of many tumors, making it an appealing target for multiple therapies [ 3 Natural products, rich in various phytochemicals, have shown significant efficacy against cancer [ 2 4 5 6 7 8 10 Despite the reported anticancer potential of graviola on numerous cancer cell lines, there are very few studies focusing specifically on oral squamous cell carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, the current investigation is the first to assess nano-encapsulated graviola against oral carcinoma cells via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway targeting. Using SCC154 cells, we compared the anticancer effects of graviola extract in both its conventional and nano-formulated forms. Materials and methods Preparation of graviola extract After soaking the powdered graviola leaves (supplied by NOW Foods, USA) in ethanol at room temperature, the mixture was extracted for 48 h, with intermittent shaking. After filtering, the extract was evaporated at 60 °C under reduced pressure until completely dry. The dry extract was then sealed in a container and designated as graviola leaves extract (GLE) [ 11 Analysis of total phenolic content and specific phenolic compounds 20 µl of GLE and 100 µl of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent were combined in a flask. To neutralize the solution, 80 µl of saturated sodium carbonate was added after the mixture had been incubated for 15 min. The mixture’s absorbance at 760 nm was measured after two further hours of incubation using a UV-visible spectrophotometer [ 12 7 11 Optimization and encapsulation of nano-formulations for GLE delivery Three distinct nano-formulations (F1-F3) were developed as potential carriers. For F1, a mixture containing 1.5 mMol of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethyl-carbodiimide (EDC) and 1.6 mMol of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was prepared. Heparin (0.1 mMol) was then coupled with 0.1 mM of polyethylene glycol amine (PEG-NH2, MW 5000 Da) and 0.1 mM of poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA, MW 7000 Da) at a ratio of 1 PEG: 1 PLGA using the EDC/NHS mixture. The resulting mixture underwent sonication for 5 min and stirring for 24 h. For F2 and F3, similar procedures were followed, with varying ratios of PEG-NH2 to PLGA (2:1 for F2 and 3:1 for F3). Characterization of graviola nanoparticles Dialysis and measurement of entrapment efficiency Graviola nanoparticles (GNPs) were subjected to dialysis for 3 h using a membrane bag (Spectra/Por membrane; molecular weight cut-off, MWCO: 25,000 Da) against distilled water. The amount of GLE retained within the NPs was quantified spectrophotometrically based on a standard calibration curve. Entrapment efficiency % (EE%) was calculated using the following formula: EE% = (Total drug − Free drug​)/Total drug ×100. Particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index analysis Laser diffractometry and photon correlation spectroscopy were used to analyze the particle size of the GNPs. One milliliter of the nanoparticle solution was put into a disposable transparent sized clear cuvette to perform measurements. A Malvern Zetasizer was used to measure the nano-sample’s size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI) at 25 °C. In vitro release analysis The release profile of GLE and GNPs was analyzed using the dialysis bag diffusion method. A known amount of GLE or GNPs, equivalent to an equal amount of graviola, was put in pre-soaked dialysis membranes (MWCO: 12 kDa) and immersed in 100 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 ± 0.5 °C with constant stirring at 100 rpm. At certain time intervals (0 to 24 h, every 2 h), 5 mL of the external medium was withdrawn and replaced with fresh PBS. Drug release was quantified by measuring absorbance at 270 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis of GNPs TEM (Philips CM-10, FEI Inc., Hillsboro, USA) was used to determine the shape of the GNPs. The nano-suspension was applied to copper grids coated with formvar at a dosage of 100 µg/mL. Once the samples were totally dry, they were dyed using a 2% w/v uranyl acetate solution. Images were taken and analyzed utilizing digital microscopy and soft imaging viewer software. In vitro experiments Cell culture Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, which contains 4.5 g/L glucose, L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (penicillin–streptomycin), was utilized to cultivate human tongue carcinoma SCC154 cells (ATCC, USA). For the best cellular growth and proliferation, the cultures were kept at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 Dosage of graviola and nano-graviola extracts The exact concentration used for graviola extract was 51.4 µg/mL, and for nano-graviola extract was 27.3 µg/mL. This was based on an initial test conducted, where the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined by measuring cell viability using the MTT test. Experimental design Three groups of cultured human tongue cancer cells were created: group I: SCC154 cells, serving as the untreated control group; group II (GLE): SCC154 cells treated with ethanolic GLE; and group III (GNPs): SCC154 cells treated with GLE encapsulated in a nano-void delivery system. All cultured carcinoma cells in groups (Ι, ΙΙ, and ΙΙΙ) were subjected to: Cell viability assessment (MTT assay) SCC154 cells were planted at a density of 1 × 10⁴ cells/well in 96-well plates. After a day, the cell culture media was supplemented with the IC50 of GLE and its NPs. Following another 24-hour incubation, MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was applied to each well, and the plates were subsequently incubated for a further 4 h at 37 °C. Dimethyl sulfoxide was utilized to dissolve the resulting dark blue, water-insoluble formazan crystals. Absorbance was determined at 450 nm using a microplate reader. The percentage of cell viability was computed in relation to the control group [ 13 Apoptosis assessment (flow cytometry) A count of 1 × 10 6 Analysis of cell cycle (flow cytometry) Measurements were taken to assess the distribution of cancer cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. The cells were cultured at a count of 2 × 10 5 DNA damage assessment (comet assay) Alkaline conditions were used for the comet assay. A 0.5% normal agarose coating was applied to standard microscope slides. Cells were washed and mixed with 0.5% low-melting-point agarose and applied to the slides. The slides were immersed in a lysing solution at 4 °C for one hour. After lysis, slides were subjected to electrophoresis in an alkaline buffer for 20 min. After electrophoresis, slides were washed and neutralized with buffers containing 10 mM Tris. Ethanol was used for fixation, and DNA was stained with ethidium bromide. Fifty randomly chosen cells from each sample were measured using a comet assay automatic image analysis system with a Leica fluorescence microscope [ 14 Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis The RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate the total RNA. A high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) was utilized to create cDNA from 1 µg of the extracted total RNA.

One hour of post fixation was conducted using 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. After being completely dehydrated, the cells were placed inside beam capsules and roasted for two days at 60 °C. Ultra-thin sections were cut out of the blocks. A Philips XL 30 transmission electron microscope was used to view these sections after they had been doubly stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate [ 16 Statistical analysis SPSS 18.0 was utilized to conduct the statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis was utilized to verify the data for normalcy. The data was expressed using the mean ± standard deviation (SD). After comparing the groups using a one-way ANOVA, pairwise comparisons were conducted using Tukey’s post hoc test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results Identification of the ethanolic extract of graviola The graviola extract with ethanol solvent exhibited very high phenolic content. There were six phenolic compounds identified using HPLC. Oleuropein, catechin, pyrogallol, gallic acid, caffeic acid, and ellagic acid were present in the GLE at different concentrations. Oleuropein and catechin were the major phenolics identified (Table 2  Table 2 Quantification of total phenolic content and some phenolic compounds in GLE Total phenolic content 250.12 ± 3.12 Compounds Concentration (mg/g) Oleuropein 69.25 ± 3.05 Catechin 52.46 ± 1.03 Pyrogallol 10.03 ± 0.50 Gallic acid 7.33 ± 0.36 Caffeic acid 2.73 ± 0.08 Ellagic acid 1.66 ± 0.06 Characterization of the nano-formulations and selection of the optimal nano system for GLE delivery The first nano-void formulation (F1), characterized by a 1:1 ratio of PLGA to PEG, exhibited the best size distribution, PDI, and zeta potential with a negative charge indicating a high level of stability followed by the second formulation (F2) with a 1:2 ratio of PLGA to PEG then the third formulation (F3) using a 1:3 ratio of PLGA to PEG. Therefore, F1 was used to encapsulate the GLE (Table 3 Physicochemical characterization of GNPs The optimized GNPs showed a mean particle size of 140.7 ± 2.5 nm, a low PDI of 0.05 ± 0.02, and a zeta potential of −23.4 ± 3.5 mV, indicating a uniform, stable nano-system. Moreover, GNPs showed high entrapment efficiency of 92.7 ± 7.26%, indicating efficient encapsulation of the active compounds within the nanocarrier (Table 3  Table 3 Average size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), and entrapment efficiency (EE %) of the synthesized NPs NPs type Ratio Mean ± SD EE % PLGA PEG Size, nm PDI ZP, mV Nano-void (F1) 1 1 120.4 ± 5.2 0.04 ± 0.01 −21.5 ± 4.7 - Nano-void (F2) 1 2 136.5 ± 9.4 1.2 ± 0.50 −3.31 ± 1.5 - Nano-void (F3) 1 3 189.13 ± 11.12 0.9 ± 0.36 + 8.5 ± 2.26 - GNPs 1 1 140.7 ± 2.5 0.05 ± 0.02 −23.4 ± 3.5 92.7 ± 7.26 Data were represented in terms of mean ± SD. Nano-void: nanoparticles without drug; F1, F2, F3, three different formulas In vitro release results The in vitro release study revealed a substantial variation in the release behavior of free GLE compared to GNPs. GLE showed a rapid release pattern, with 95% ± 1.0% of the extract diffused within 2 h and complete release (100% ± 0.0%) by 4 h, indicating immediate diffusion of free graviola molecules. In contrast, GNPs exhibited a sustained release profile, with only 15.5% ± 3.4% released at 2 h, 22.2% ± 5.6% at 4 h, and 37.0% ± 5.6% at 6 h. By 12 h, 51.0% ± 4.9% was released, gradually increasing to 67.0% ± 7.3% at 20 h and reaching a maximum of 77.7% ± 5.8% at 24 h (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 a b TEM results of GNPs The NPs exhibited a core-shell structure composed of a core surrounded by rounded membranes made of PLGA and PEG. The GLE was encapsulated within the core of the NPs (Fig. 1 MTT assay results There was a statistical difference in cell proliferation percentage among all groups using ANOVA ( p p p 2 Fig. 2 a b c d Significance at p Apoptosis results There was a statistical difference in viability, early apoptosis, late apoptosis, and necrosis among all groups using ANOVA ( p p p p p p 2 Cell cycle analysis results The cell cycle was assessed by categorizing cells into three phases: the G0/G1 phase, DNA synthesis S phase, and the G2/M phase.

The cytoplasm contained endoplasmic reticulum, cytoskeleton, and mitochondria. Cells displayed smooth, undamaged plasma membrane (Fig. 4 4 4  Fig. 4 An electron micrograph of tongue carcinoma SCC154 cells showing ( a b c Discussion Targeted cancer therapies provide great specificity in treatment; however, they often face challenges such as resistance mechanisms and difficulties in delivery. As a result, there is an ongoing need to develop new therapies to address these issues [ 17 Graviola leaves have shown cytotoxic effects on a range of cancer cell lines, triggering apoptosis via different mechanisms, suggesting their potential as effective anticancer agents [ 18 19 20 21 23 In the current work, GLE and GNPs exhibited significantly higher cytotoxic, apoptotic, and DNA-damaging effects, along with pronounced cell cycle arrest, compared to the untreated group, with significantly better results in the nano-formulation compared to its free counterpart. This might be attributed to the high entrapment efficiency of GNPs synthesized in this study, which enabled sustained drug release and improved compound stability, thereby enhancing the bioavailability of the active agents within cancer cells and contributing to the observed cytotoxic effects. These findings aligned with Magadi et al. [ 24 25 Graviola extract likely induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial-mediated mechanism by breaking the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest [ 26 27 28 29 A key aspect of this study is assessing the molecular expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Tumorigenesis is significantly influenced by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway’s activation. This pathway contributes to resistance against anticancer therapies. Activated AKT phosphorylates and inactivates pro-apoptotic markers such as BAD and caspase-9, allowing anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to preserve mitochondrial integrity and prevent cell death. In contrast, inhibition of this pathway shifts the balance towards apoptosis by promoting cytochrome c release and activating caspase-9 and caspase-3. These events clarify how PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling functions not just upstream, but also as a master regulator of downstream apoptotic control [ 30 31 5 32 33 Fig. 5 The intrinsic, extrinsic, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation. The red lines with rounded ends indicate inhibition, while black arrows indicate stimulation GSK-3β is a serine/threonine kinase that possess multiple roles in cellular processes and signaling pathways. Researchers have explored the inhibition of GSK-3β as a potential treatment for cancer. Inhibiting GSK-3β has been associated with a reduction in cancer cell growth across several types of malignancies, including prostate, and colon cancers and leukemia [ 34 36 The current work revealed a significant downregulation of PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and GSK-3β mRNA levels in cancer cells treated with GLE and GNPs compared to the untreated group, with a significant downregulation in GNPs compared to its free counterpart. These molecular alterations aligned with the observed cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects, suggesting their involvement in the treatment response. Consistent with our findings, Shorning et al. [ 37 38 In the present investigation, the ultrastructural analysis demonstrated significant degenerative alterations in tongue carcinoma SCC154 cells following treatment with both GLE and GNPs, with these alterations being aggravated in the nano-encapsulated group. These findings support the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects observed in earlier assays. In the current work, the anticancer effect of graviola and its nano formulation could be attributed to the phenolic compounds identified in GLE. Oleuropein was identified as the major compound in our GLE. Oleuropein has been shown to suppress cancer cell proliferation and enhance apoptosis by targeting the AKT signaling pathway. It increases the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and decreases the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 [ 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 Limitations This study has some limitations. First, gene expression was evaluated only at the mRNA level using qPCR, without assessing protein levels via western blotting or ELISA. While mRNA analysis provides valuable insight into gene regulation, it does not necessarily reflect actual protein expression; therefore, future studies incorporating proteomic analysis are encouraged. Second, the absence of separate vehicle control groups for the solvent and carrier used in the treatment formulations limits the ability to attribute observed effects solely to the active agents. Although an untreated control group was included, vehicle controls would have strengthened data interpretation. Lastly, the exclusive use of in vitro models, while useful for controlled cellular analysis, may not fully reflect the complexity of in vivo biological systems, thereby limiting the translational value of the findings. Therefore, planned animal studies are suggested to further assess the therapeutic efficacy, safety, and physiological relevance of nano-encapsulated graviola in a more complex biological context. Conclusion This study is the first to demonstrate that nano-encapsulated graviola exhibits promising anticancer activity against tongue carcinoma cells by inducing cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. These effects were partially mediated through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Nano-formulation enhanced graviola’s bioavailability, stability, and targeted delivery, further improving its therapeutic efficacy. While these findings support its potential as a complementary agent in oral squamous cell carcinoma and possibly other cancers, further in vivo studies and clinical trials are essential to confirm its safety and therapeutic value. Therefore, nano-graviola cannot be yet recommended as a standalone or alternative treatment. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
