However, patients are often unaware of the harmful effects tongue piercings can have on their oral health. Despite its popularity, this form of body modification carries considerable risk, particularly when performed or maintained without proper care. This review summarizes findings from clinical case reports, observational studies, and previous literature reviews, with a focus on the clinical outcomes of tongue piercings and their appropriate management. Methods: An internet-based literature review was conducted to evaluate the short- and long-term oral health implications of tongue piercings. Only articles published between January 1990 and April 2025 were included. The databases searched were PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, using keywords such as “tongue piercing,” “oral piercing,” “oral complications,” and “dental trauma.” Results: The literature revealed that tongue piercings can lead to numerous adverse effects on oral health, including dental fractures, gingival recession, enamel wear, and localized tissue overgrowth, in addition to localized and systemic infections. The presence of foreign objects in the oral cavity, combined with poor oral hygiene, habitual trauma, and long-term contact with oral tissues, often worsens these complications. Conclusions: The results of this literature review suggest that tongue piercings pose significant and often underestimated risks to oral health. Clinicians should remain vigilant, educate patients on potential complications, and be well-equipped to prevent, monitor, and manage associated dental problems effectively in clinical practice. tongue piercing oral health piercing complications piercing effects dental trauma soft tissue injuries This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Body piercing is defined as the insertion of jewelry into openings made in various parts of the body, including but not limited to the ears, eyebrows, lips, tongue, nose, nipples, and intimate areas [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 The literature highlights various intraoral sites for piercing, including the tongue, lips, lingual frenulum, labial frenulum, uvula, and cheek. A summary of the most common areas and negative effects caused by intra-oral piercing can be seen in Table 1 9 10 11 12 Tongue piercings have been associated with various negative effects on oral and systemic health as reported in the literature. Common complications include pain, swelling, bleeding, infection, gingival recession, and soft tissue lesions. Additionally, changes in oral microflora, altered salivary composition, compromised periodontal health, and dental damage such as chipped or fractured teeth have also been documented [ 19 20 21 22 Presently, the existing literature on the complications caused by oral piercings presents limitations related to their research design, heterogeneity and quality of the evidence since much of the evidence is derived from low-quality studies such as case reports and small observational designs, hence limiting the strength and generalizability of their findings. Additionally, systematic reviews frequently include strict inclusion criteria, potentially omitting clinically relevant data. There is also a gap in studies addressing public and professional awareness, with limited attention given to preventive strategies and post-piercing care practices. This narrative literature review aimed to explore and summarize the impact of tongue piercings on oral health, emphasizing the negative side effects associated with their use. While narrative reviews lack the systematic methodology used in systematic reviews, they offer a broad and adaptable approach to exploring a topic in an emerging field, enabling the synthesis of diverse sources and the identification of trends and gaps in the literature. This flexibility makes narrative reviews especially useful for generating hypotheses and guiding future research directions. This type of review is well known in the field of dentistry, where several respected journals regularly publish high-quality narrative reviews to inform both clinical practice and academic research. In addition to shed light on the potential complications arising from tongue piercings, ranging from localized oral health issues to systemic implications. It underscores the critical importance of informing patients about the risks associated with tongue piercings before placement and advocates for comprehensive patient education. Additionally, this review serves as an educational resource for younger clinicians, equipping them with the knowledge and tools needed to counsel patients effectively on the potential consequences of tongue piercings. By fostering awareness, clinicians can help mitigate adverse outcomes and promote informed decision-making among their patients. 2. Materials and Methods Articles published between January 1990 and March 2025 on the topic of tongue piercings and their impact on oral health were searched on four major medical research databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search strategy did not include filters and employed the terms “tongue piercing” and “oral piercing” to identify relevant literature. The initial search yielded a total of 257 articles. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are outlined in Table 2 3. Results The literature review conducted revealed multiple publications addressing the oral health effects associated with tongue piercings. To better organize and analyze this information, the selected studies were categorized into two distinct tables based on their type, scope, and clinical focus. Following a review of the titles and abstracts, 19 manuscripts were selected for inclusion in this review. These were categorized into two main groups: 14 case studies and clinical reports, and 5 literature reviews, each offering an analysis into the oral complications associated with tongue piercings. Table 3 Table 4 The reviewed literature identified several common sites for tongue piercings. These include the middle tongue piercing (vertical tongue piercing) with a straight barbell placed at the center of the tongue, and the double tongue piercing, featuring two piercings aligned along the midline. The ring tongue piercing is also common and is generally positioned at the center of the tongue. Additionally, the double lateral tongue piercing consists of two studs placed parallel to each other on either side of the tongue, while the horizontal tongue piercing runs through the tip of the tongue, with ball ends on each side. Finally, there are multiple tongue piercings, which often involve two or more piercings arranged in a row or symmetrically on either side of the midline. A schematic diagram illustrating these piercing sites is provided in Figure 1 4. Discussion 4.1. Dental Trauma Frequent biting or abnormal chewing patterns associated with tongue piercings frequently result in dental trauma, the severity of which can vary depending on the duration of wear and the type of jewelry used. This trauma commonly affects the enamel and dentin and, in more severe cases, may extend to the pulp. Clinical reports have documented fractures of tooth cusps caused by repeated contact between tongue jewelry and the teeth [ 42 43 44 45 46 4.2. Gingival and Mucosa Trauma Clinical reports consistently highlight that tongue piercings can cause significant trauma to oral soft tissues, particularly the gingiva and mucosa. Gingival recession is one of the most frequently documented complications, most often affecting the lingual aspect of the lower central incisors due to repetitive mechanical trauma from the jewelry [ 47 48 49 50 In addition to gingival trauma, tongue piercings can irritate the internal surfaces of the cheeks and palate, often causing redness, swelling, and localized pain [ 48 51 52 53 Other reported complications include erythematous changes in the palatal mucosa indicating localized inflammation, transient alterations in taste perception—possibly due to lingual nerve irritation—and leakage of blood or serum from the piercing site, which may persist beyond the normal healing period and suggest delayed healing or secondary infection [ 49 4.3. Risk of Hemorrhage The most commonly reported issues are prolonged bleeding following tongue perforation. Due to the tongue’s dense vascularization, improper technique or incorrect placement can result in damage to blood vessels. If larger vessels are affected, the resulting hemorrhage can be severe and may require urgent medical intervention [ 54 55 4.4. Tissue Overgrowth Tongue piercings subject the oral mucosa to repeated microtrauma, initiating a chronic wound-healing response characterized by collagen deposition and fibrous tissue formation. Experimental histological studies in animal models have demonstrated that initial granulation tissue at the piercing site progressively transforms into dense fibrosis, often accompanied by foreign body granulomas [ 56 57 58 59 4.5. Localized Infections Tongue piercings act as direct entry points for microorganisms, making localized infections a common complication. These infections typically present with erythema, edema, pain, and purulent discharge at the piercing site. The tongue’s constant movement, proximity to a diverse microbial population, and challenges in maintaining proper hygiene around the jewelry further increase the risk. Clinical studies report infection rates between 10% and 30% during the immediate post-piercing period [ 60 Streptococcus Staphylococcus aureus 61 62 63 4.6. Systemic Infections Although less common than local complications, tongue piercings have been linked to systemic infections due to the rich vascular supply of oral tissues, which facilitates the entry of pathogens into the bloodstream. Cases of bacteremia following tongue piercing have been documented and pose a significant risk, particularly for immunocompromised individuals and patients with prosthetic heart valves [ 64 Streptococcus viridans Staphylococcus aureus 60 65 66 67 4.7. Ingested Piercing Although most ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without complication, the accidental ingestion of tongue piercing components poses a documented health risk. Detachment often occurs unknowingly during eating or sleeping, making early detection difficult. Ingested parts may cause trauma to the oropharynx or, in rare but serious cases, result in gastric retention, appendicitis, or intestinal obstruction [ 68 69 70 71 72 4.8. Limitations of the Review This narrative review was not conducted following a predefined and structured protocol for literature search and selection, as is typically required for systematic reviews. Instead, the methodology was more flexible, aiming to provide a broad overview of the available literature on the oral health effects of tongue piercing. The literature search was restricted to English-language publications indexed in four major databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. Although no filters were applied during the search process to maximize literature inclusion, certain types of publications were excluded—specifically, non-indexed studies, conference abstracts, letters to the editor, and articles published in languages other than English. These exclusions inherently limited the scope of the review and may have resulted in the omission of potentially relevant findings. Additionally, no formal risk of bias assessment or quality grading of the included studies was performed, which are typically part of systematic or meta-analytical approaches. The authors acknowledge these limitations may limit the reach of the present review. Additionally, future investigations on this topic with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, standardized data extraction, and critical appraisal of studies quality, and statistical analysis of the data gathered is required. This would allow for a more rigorous and quantitative evaluation of the clinical effects of tongue piercings and support evidence-based recommendations for dental professionals and patients alike. 4.9. Recommendations Tongue piercings, though popular among adolescents and young adults, pose significant risks to oral and overall health. Complications can include pain, swelling, gum recession, tooth fractures, enamel wear, speech and chewing difficulties, and infections. In rare cases, serious conditions like nerve damage or infective endocarditis may occur. We strongly advise patients to reconsider this type of oral piercing. For patients who still choose to proceed with a tongue piercing, it is essential they are fully informed of these potential risks. Clinicians should take the time to educate patients about proper oral hygiene, the importance of regular dental checkups, and the need to monitor for early signs of complications. In addition, dental providers must be prepared to diagnose and manage emergencies related to oral piercings, including infections, bleeding, allergic reactions, and soft or hard tissue injuries. Ultimately, prevention through patient education remains the best approach. We strongly encourage patients to reconsider oral piercings in favor of safer alternatives, and we urge clinicians to maintain a proactive stance in counseling and care related to body modifications in the oral cavity. 5. Conclusions Dentists should be aware that tongue piercing remains a popular trend among teenagers and young adults, and they must be prepared to manage the various oral health complications associated with this trend. These may include damage to hard and soft tissues, such as tooth fractures, gingival recession, and soft tissue trauma, as well as localized or systemic infections. Some patients may schedule appointments to seek advice before getting a tongue piercing, and clinicians should be ready to provide clear, evidence-based information regarding potential risks and long-term consequences. Patient education should emphasize the importance of oral hygiene, regular checkups, and early signs of complications to help minimize adverse outcomes.

(1998) [ 23 A 25-year-old Caucasian female sought a dental consultation about getting a tongue piercing. The practitioner advised against it, explaining the potential complications. Despite this, the patient proceeded with the piercing. One week later, she returned with tongue swelling and reported difficulty speaking and chewing. She was prescribed an analgesic mouthwash and oral pain medication. Dentists should also be able to provide consultation to patients contemplating oral piercing. While many oral piercings probably resolve uneventfully, the Brennan et al. (2006) [ 24 An 18-year-old Caucasian female patient presented to the dental emergency department complaining of generalized sensitivity to cold drinks and when breathing. Clinical examination revealed dentin fracture on the palatal aspects of 15 and 24 and lingual of 34 and 36. Patient received a tongue piercing (18 mm barbell shaped). Tooth lesions were restored with resin composite. With the growing popularity of oral piercing, patients will need to be more informed of potential complications associated with this procedure. Clinicians need to be aware of the potential etiology of dental fractures, secondary to the placement of intraoral jewelry. Shinohara et al. (2007) [ 25 A 16-year-old white male presented to the emergency department with healed mucosa over a tongue piercing placed four months earlier. One month after the piercing, he noticed the sphere had penetrated the central surface of his tongue. Clinical examination revealed a firm, 5 mm mass embedded in the midline. Under local anesthesia, the piercing was surgically exposed, removed, and the site was sutured. This case reports an oral piercing with part of the hardware embedded beneath the ventral tongue mucosa, likely caused by the patient’s habit of biting and pulling on the dorsal ball before healing. The issue was resolved through surgical removal, and the patient chose not to replace the piercing. Zadik et al. (2007) [ 26 An 18.5-year-old female presented to the dental emergency service with mobility of her lower front teeth. Clinical exam revealed a 2.5 cm metal/plastic tongue piercing on the mid-dorsum, with a bent metal bar and calculus around the plastic sphere near the floor of the mouth. The patient had received the piercing 4.5 years earlier. Lingual gingival recession, 7 mm attachment loss, 4 mm probing depth, and type II mobility were noted in the mandibular incisors. Although informed of the damage caused by the piercing, the patient refused removal and opted to replace it with a shorter one. Dentists should carefully exam the oral tissue of patients with oral piercing for early diagnosis of these complications. Dental surgeons have the responsibility to educate their patients about these conditions and to recommend appropriate treatment to them. Berenguer et al. (2006) [ 27 A 28-year-old woman presented to the department of periodontology with the chief complaint of “loose hurting teeth” in the lower anterior area. The patient had worn 2 lingual hoops and a mandibular labrette in the form of a bar for the previous 12 years. Clinical evaluation revealed severe periodontitis in the lower anterior teeth, a very unusual condition in a healthy young adult. All the mandibular anterior teeth presented from moderate to severe mobility. Probing depths ranged from 3 to 7 mm. Patient was informed that the cause was the tongue piercing and she decided to discontinue its use. Dentists and physicians have an ethical mandate to educate patients about potential complications resulting from intraoral jewelry use. While short-term case reports have documented numerous dental injuries related to intraoral piercing, this long-term case report illustrates the potential for such devices to result in rapid periodontal destruction, tooth loss, and eventually loss of normal function. Correa et al. (2014) [ 28 A 23-year-old female presented with pain in the mandibular anterior region. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no tobacco use. Intraoral examination revealed a double-ended metal tongue piercing placed 7 years prior. The piercing had caused a diastema between the mandibular central incisors, with probing depths of 6–8 mm, bleeding on probing, and grade II tooth mobility. Treatment included removal of the piercing and scaling and root planing of the affected sites. The use of oral piercings has become a fashionable practice worldwide. The mean prevalence of oral and peri-oral piercing, in general, population is 5.2%. It is generally recommended that following healing, such ornaments should be removed daily and cleaned to avoid plaque and calculus accumulation. However, some patients rarely remove their ornaments for cleaning. Bajkin et al. (2014) [ 29 A 15.5-year-old female presented with pain and mild swelling near the lower central incisors. Examination revealed a midline barbell-shaped tongue piercing. Both central incisors were non-vital, mobile, and showed clinical attachment loss. Incisal chipping was noted on both maxillary and mandibular central incisors. The piercing was removed, and the patient received endodontic treatment along with bone grafting for the mandibular incisors. Bearing in mind that oral piercing is becoming a common practice, oral health professionals should educate the patients and inform them about possible oral health complications associated with this form of body art. It is especially necessary to warn patients with oral piercings about bad habits that could lead to traumatic injuries of teeth and adjacent structures. Albeshri et al. (2024) [ 30 A 27-year-old Hispanic female patient to the periodontics clinic. Patient was referred from a general dentist that removed her tongue piercing after 12 months of use. Piercing created swelling and suppuration in the mandibular anterior region. Probing depths ranged from 6 to 11 mm. Treatment included full mouth debridement and splint in the lower anterior region followed by bone grafting. Tongue piercing has negative consequences for periodontal health. Correct diagnosis and treatment planning are needed for the management of various periodontal diseases. The presented case was treated successfully via regenerative therapy with a combination of allograft and membrane. The end result was that questionable teeth were saved and restored to periodontal health. Kretchmer et al. (2002) [ 31 A 22-year-old-male presented to the periodontology clinic for evaluation of the mandibular anterior sextant. Periapical and clinical examination revealed localized horizontal bone loss associated with lower central incisors with 6 mm probing depths, plaque and calculus. Tx included prophylaxis, flap reflection to remove supra and subgingival calculus. Patient stopped using the piercing. The authors of this report remain confident that with the removal of the tongue stud and the stabilization of the bony lesion, the localized inflammation will resolve, and these teeth will be maintained for a significant amount of time. Shacham et al. (2003) [ 32 Piercing has become so popular during the last 20 to 30 years that many physicians are now treating patients with piercings and dealing with its side effects. Authors present 3 cases that illustrate the complications of tongue piercing (i.e., infection, bleeding, and embedded ornaments). Authors describe the methods for inserting the ornaments to illustrate the possible adverse effects. When a patient does present with an inflamed tongue caused by piercing, the physician should remove the jewelry, perform a local debridement, institute antibiotic therapy, and give the patient chlorhexidine mouthwash. The patient should be closely observed to monitor the spread of infection. The opening through the tongue will spontaneously occlude. Lopez-Jornet et al. (2005) [ 33 A 28-year-old male patient presented with lingual piercing. A week after the piercing placement presented with pain. Two months after the ball became partially buried within the tongue. Treatment was to surgically remove the piercing under local anesthesia. Tongue healed with no further problems. The type of piercing generally used in the tongue consists of a stud with 2 balls that are screwed to each end. It is inserted in the central, thickest area, always avoiding the lingual frenum, as well as taking care not to damage the vascular nerves. Complications are sufficiently frequent to put into question the safety of piercing, the dangers of which can be considered. Fleming et al. (2005) [ 34 A 17-year-old male referred to the maxillofacial clinic. Patient had a tongue ornament placed one year previously during a period of severe psychiatric disturbances. The area became infected and healed over leaving the tongue divided at the anterior or midline. The tongue was repaired under general anesthetic as a day case. The tongue healed without complication. Unusual malformations may be attributable to tongue piercings. These abnormalities may occasionally present when ornaments are no longer in situ. Patients contemplating tongue jewelryshould be counseled on early and late complications. Likewise, dentists must be aware of the pitfalls of orofacial jewelry. Patussi et al. (2014) [ 35 A 23-year-old woman was referred with a painless midline nodule on the dorsal tongue, approximately 15 mm in diameter. She had worn a tongue piercing in the same area for 3 years, removed 2 years prior. The lesion was excised, and histopathology revealed an ulcerated lesion with endothelial proliferation and edematous stroma. The patient had a good outcome with no recurrence after 12 months of follow-up. Oral piercings can cause mechanical trauma, tooth fractures, speech issues, pain, aspiration, lip inflammation, tissue overgrowth, infections, edema, allergies, tongue lacerations, black tongue, galvanism, scarring, increased saliva, interference with X-rays, nerve damage, and paresthesia. Özdemir et al. (2018) [ 36 AA 16-year-old female presented with severe pain and a lesion on the underside of her tongue and floor of the mouth, two months after receiving a barbell-shaped tongue piercing. Examination revealed perforation of the mouth floor. The piercing was removed under lidocaine spray in the operating room, and the patient was prescribed chlorhexidine rinses and analgesics. One week later, the lesion had healed, and the patient reported no further symptoms. Piercings should be performed by specialists under sterile conditions. Good oral hygiene is essential to prevent bacterial colonization and infection around the piercing site. The tongue jewelry must fit snugly to avoid excessive movement but not so tight as to cause tissue necrosis. clinpract-15-00171-t004_Table 4 Table 4 Summary reviews about tongue piercing [ 37 38 39 40 41 Authors/Year Methods Results Hennequin-Hoenderdos et al. (2016) [ 37 The research resulted in 1865 papers and after screening by title and abstract 33 papers were selected for full-text reading, of which 17 we excluded because did not match the eligibility criteria. Finally, 15 papers were selected and processed for data extraction. A significant relative risk was revealed between tongue piercings and an increased incidence of enamel fissures, enamel fractures and gingival recessions (especially int he lingual region of the mandibular incisors). Both lip and tongue piercings were highly associated with gingival recession Plastargias et al. (2014) [ 38 The purpose of this paper is to review the potential complications caused by oral piercings as they are analyzed in the literature. This manuscript also suggests some ways of improving the oral hygiene of the people who wear piercings, and it suggests some methods of ameliorating the negative consequences of piercings. Oral piercing is not harmless at all. In fact, the vast majority of the reviews and case reports that have been published concerning this issue have agreed that oral piercings pose both a hazardous direct and indirect risk to the soft and hard oral and perioral tissues and they may even pose life-threatening risks. Theodossy et al. (2014) [ 39 A review of the possible complications of tongue piercing is included in the manuscript. A variety of potential complications of oral piercing have been suggested. The most common of which are pain and swelling. Edema of the tongue is a feature of all tongue piercing, because of the vascularity of the area, and can lead to airway compromise as a direct consequence or due to aspiration of the jewelry. Dentists should be aware of the increasing number of patients with pierced intraoral and peri-oral sites and be prepared to address dental issues, such as potential damage to the teeth and gingiva and risk of oral infection, which may arise as a result of piercing. Dentists also need to provide appropriate guidance to patients who are contemplating body piercing involving oral sites. Maheu-Robert et al. (2007) [ 40 It is a brief review of the current literature on potential complications and adverse consequences of tongue and lip piercings. The objective is to provide a general overview of possible problems that may be encountered by dentists. In addition, authors highlight the urgent need for dentists and doctors to inform target patients of the risks associated with oral piercings. Tongue and lip piercings represent a significant risk for direct and indirect damage to soft and hard oral tissues. Although much less prevalent, lethal systemic infections may also occur. Considering the growing popularity of intraoral and perioral piercings, dental professionals should be aware of the potential complications associated with this practice and be able to identify those at high risk for adverse outcomes. Ziebolz et al. (2009) [ 41 Dental professionals are seeing an increasing number of patients with oral piercings and as a result they should be able to inform their patients about possible risks and complications associated with such piercings. The three cases presented here demonstrate some adverse effects of tongue piercings. The most commonly described oral complication is the damage of teeth and the periodontium. Tongue piercing is a personal decision, but it is important patients are fully aware of possible oral health hazards. ",
