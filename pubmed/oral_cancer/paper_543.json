Background Cardiac involvement in malignancies is rare, with right ventricular tumoral thrombus in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without right atrial extension being exceptionally uncommon. Case Summary A 54-year-old man with stage IV HCC experienced recurrent chest discomfort. Stress echocardiography detected an ill-defined inhomogeneous mass, and cardiac magnetic resonance identified right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, left ventricular septal infiltration, and acute-to-subacute myocarditis. Abdominal imaging showed tumor recurrence along with a large thrombus in the retrohepatic inferior vena cava. After multidisciplinary discussions, the patient opted for palliative comfort care. Discussion Systemic therapy for HCC such as atezolizumab-bevacizumab and lenvatinib may contribute to thrombosis, cardiac dysfunction, and myocarditis. Currently, there are no established guidelines for managing right ventricular tumoral thrombus with outflow tract obstruction complicated by myocarditis, which if untreated could lead to irreversible ventricular dysfunction. Conclusions This case highlights the significance of shared decision-making and a multidisciplinary patient-centered approach in optimizing treatment outcomes in complex cardio-oncology care.

He had completed 3 cycles of atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy and subsequently initiated lenvatinib owing to tumor recurrence, with symptoms developing 5 months into treatment. Take-Home Messages • This case underscores the importance of shared decision-making and a multidisciplinary patient-centered approach in complex cardio-oncology care. • Treatment plans should align medical objectives with personal goals, and all options—along with their risks and benefits—must be clearly explained to support informed, individualized decisions, as no one-size-fits-all solution exists. On outpatient evaluation, the patient was hemodynamically stable except for tachycardia (104 beats/min). Electrocardiogram showed right-axis deviation with right ventricular (RV) strain pattern and normal corrected QT by Fridericia method (QTcF) of 445 ms ( Figure 1A Figure 2A Video 1 Figures 2B 2C Video 2 Video 3 Figure 1 Electrocardiogram Series (A) Baseline ECG shows sinus rhythm, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular strain pattern, with normal QTcF of 445 ms.

Past Medical History The patient was diagnosed 2 years earlier with HCC classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A, and he underwent an open right hepatectomy. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) imaging and elevated PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II) levels indicated local disease progression and recurrence. As a result, his treatment regimen was transitioned from atezolizumab-bevacizumab combination to lenvatinib (12 mg daily). He remained compliant with therapy and maintained functional independence until the onset of his current symptoms, prompting cardiology follow-up and further evaluation. His medical history included hypertension, bronchial asthma, and hypothyroidism, and the cardiac medications he was currently taking were amlodipine, valsartan, clopidogrel, and nebivolol. Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for intracardiac masses includes thrombi, benign and malignant primary cardiac tumors (eg, myxomas, fibromas, lipomas), metastatic tumors, infectious abscesses and vegetations, and sarcomas. Investigations Further imaging was recommended by a multidisciplinary team comprising cardiology, oncology, critical care, and thoracic cardiovascular surgery. Abdominal CT scan demonstrated tumor recurrence at the prior hepatectomy site. CT pulmonary angiography showed no pulmonary embolism or lower extremity thrombosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) demonstrated a dilated RV with mild systolic dysfunction and a large, lobulated intracavitary mass occupying the entire RV, partially obstructing the RV outflow tract ( Videos 4 5 Figures 3A 3B Video 6 Figure 3C Video 7 Figure 3D Figures 4A 4B Figure 3 Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images Cine imaging with short-axis view (A) and 4-chamber view (B) showing a large, lobulated mass occupying the RV cavity with partial obstruction of the RVOT (not seen in these images) and infiltration of the LV septum.

Management (Medical/Interventions) The patient was immediately admitted to the telemetry unit for close monitoring. Therapeutic enoxaparin and prednisone (1 mg/kg/d) were initiated, with plans for gradual steroid taper. Treatment options—including open heart surgery, radiation, targeted therapy (cabozantinib), and palliative care—were discussed with the patient and family. While deliberating, the patient experienced persistent chest pain and intermittent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. On day 3 of hospitalization, the QTcF interval increased from 445 to 491 ms ( Figures 1B 1C Outcome and Follow-Up The patient was discharged with systemic therapy, anticoagulation, corticosteroids, pain management, and other supportive measures. He died peacefully 2 months later from gastrointestinal complications. Discussion HCC is an aggressive malignancy often associated with tumor thrombus extension into the portal and hepatic veins, and it frequently metastasizes to the lungs, lymph nodes, and bones. 1 1 Cardiac metastasis should be considered in patients with known malignancy presenting with myocardial ischemia or injury, even without classic ischemic symptoms. 1 2 2 2 2 2 Systemic therapy remains a cornerstone for advanced and unresectable HCC. 3 3 3 4 4 TKI-related cardiotoxicity can present as hypertension, acute coronary syndrome, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, QTc prolongation, sudden cardiac death, cardiomyopathy, and systolic dysfunction. 5 6 3 Besides TKIs, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors have emerged as key second-line treatments for advanced HCC. 7 8 8 These therapies pose notable cardiovascular risks. Bevacizumab is associated with hypertension (25.3%), thromboembolism (20%), cardiac dysfunction (3%-15%), heart failure (10%), and myocardial ischemia (3.8%), primarily due to VEGF pathway inhibition leading to endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, arterial stiffness, and mitochondrial injury. 7 7 8 9 9 10 9 In this case, CMR revealed late gadolinium enhancement consistent with acute-to-subacute myocarditis, likely linked to atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy administered 7 to 8 months earlier. Despite normal baseline troponin I levels and no pericardial effusion on transthoracic echocardiogram or CMR, the presence of QTcF prolongation, elevated NT-proBNP, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia supported a diagnosis of ICI-associated myocarditis. Definitive diagnosis requires clinical evidence plus histopathology or CMR findings. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends high-dose steroids (1-2 mg/kg oral or intravenous prednisone daily) tapered over 4 to 6 weeks. 9 HCC with intracardiac involvement carries a poor prognosis, typically reflecting widespread disease. Mortality approaches 80%, with a median survival of 102 days. 1 3 In the absence of established management guidelines, treatment must be individualized based on clinical status, prognosis, and patient goals. The patient's decision to prioritize family and palliative care underscores the importance of a patient-centered, multidisciplinary approach in managing such complex cases. Conclusions RV involvement without right atrial extension in HCC, especially alongside myocarditis, is exceedingly rare, and its management requires prompt, multidisciplinary intervention. A collaborative approach involving the patient is crucial to developing a tailored treatment plan that aligns with the patient's goals and preferences.
