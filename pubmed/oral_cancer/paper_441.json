Moreover, cells undergoing partial EMT may adopt a continuum of E/M states, further exacerbating tumour heterogeneity, resulting in chemoresistance and metastasis [ 6 10 high high high low low high 11 12 12 Wnt/β-catenin signalling is a powerful driver of stemness in normal and malignant cells [ 13 14 13 14 14 2+ 15 The Wnt/β-catenin pathway activates cancer stem cell maintenance via promotion of EMT transcription factors such as Snail and FOXC2. Interestingly, FOXC2 promotes tumour aggressiveness and poor prognosis in basal-like triple-negative breast cancers via activation of EMT, stemness and drug resistance [ 16 18 19 22 Using E/M (CD104 high high low high transient Methods Cell lines and culture MCF10A, MDA-MB-468, HCC1143, and HEK293T were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).

CD104-PE and CD44-APC were from Biolegend. E-cadherin and N-cadherin were from BD Biosciences. Snail, Slug, Vimentin, p-EGFR (Y1173), EGFR, p-AKT(Ser374), AKT, p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), p-Rb (Ser780), PCNA, Cleaved-PARP were from Cell Signaling Technology. SOX9 was from Millipore-Sigma. FOXM1 and β-actin were from Proteintech. p-FOXM1(Ser35) was from MyBiosource. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories.

Ligands and inhibitors Wnt3a conditioned media (CM) was prepared from L-Wnt3a cells. L-Wnt3a cells were cultured in a 10-cm Petri dish with 10 ml DMEM medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum until the cells reached 60% confluency. Then, substitute with 10 ml fresh culture medium without antibiotics and culture for another 2 days. Collect and filter (0.2-μm pore) the Wnt3a-conditioned media and store at −20 °C. For Wnt3a activation, mix 1-part Wnt3a conditioned media and 1-part regular media and add to cultured cells. Wnt3a human recombinant protein was obtained from R&D Systems. Human recombinant EGF was from PeproTech (Cat# AF-100-15), FGF was from Biotechne R&D systems (Cat# 3718-FB-025), insulin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Cat# sc-360248), heparin and hydrocortisone were purchased from Sigma (Cat# H3393; Cat# H0888). The MEK1 inhibitor, PD0325901 (PD901), was from Selleckchem, dissolved in DMSO and stored in −20 °C. The cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of PD0325901 (PD901) for 24 h before protein extraction. Palbociclib or Abemaciclib was from MedChemExpress, dissolved in DMSO and stored in −20 °C. ICG001 was from Selleckchem (Cat # S2662), dissolved in DMSO and stored at −20 °C. Protein extraction and immunoblotting Cells or tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein lysate concentration was measured by and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl with 4× sample buffer. In total, 30 μg protein was loaded onto 7–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon membranes. Blots were probed overnight at 4 °C with indicated antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence (Perkin Elmer or Amersham). Immunofluorescence staining on cells and paraffin-embedded tissue sections Cells seeded on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilised in 0.01% Triton X-100, washed in PBS, and blocked in 5% goat serum/2% BSA/PBS for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed, and incubated with 1:2000 Alexa Fluor secondary antibody in 2% BSA/PBS for 1.5 h. Cells were then washed in 0.5% BSA/PBS and stained with DAPI. For tissue immunofluorescence, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour sections were baked at 55 °C for 1 h, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in a series of 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and distilled water. Antigen retrieval was performed using 1× antigen retrieval solution (Sigma, pH 6.0). Tissues were then incubated with primary antibody in 5% donkey serum, 2% BSA, 0.5%TX-100 in TBS, followed by Alexa Fluor secondary antibody incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature, washed and mounted with mounting media containing DAPI (SouthernBiotech). Quantification of tissue immunofluorescence staining Quantification of immunofluorescence staining was performed using ImageJ software to analyse different regions of the tumour. Specific markers were used to identify distinct cellular populations, and fluorescence intensity measurements were obtained for each marker. Regions of interest (ROIs) were carefully selected to ensure an accurate representation of tumour heterogeneity. The fluorescence signals were quantified using standardised thresholding methods to minimise variability. The resulting quantification data were then subjected to statistical analysis to compare marker expression across different tumour regions, facilitating an objective evaluation of spatial variations in protein expression. TOP/FOP flash assay Cells were plated in 24-well plates in duplicates. Reporter plasmid TOP-Flash or FOP-Flash, which contain three optimal copies of the TCF/LEF-binding site (TOPFlash), or mutated copies of the TCF/LEF-binding site (FOPFlash) upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter directing transcription of a luciferase gene were used. (TOPFlash) or (FOPFlash; 0.5 μg) together with a Renilla luciferase plasmid (0.1 μg) were transfected using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfection was done soon after plating the cells in suspension. To activate the Wnt signalling following 24 h of transfection, Wnt3a-conditioned media with or without 10 μmol/L ICG001 (Selleck Chemicals) were added. Cell lysates were obtained using the lysis buffer provided in the Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Cat#E1910). Firefly and Renilla luciferase readings were recorded 48 h post-transfection using Luminometer (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity is then normalised to the Renilla luciferase activity. The fold increase in TOP-Flash activity compared with FOP-Flash was plotted as mean ± SEM of triplicate tests and validated by t P Transwell EGF chemotaxis EGF chemotaxis of MCF10A cells, single-cell suspension of 5 × 10 4 t P Mammosphere formation Cells were trypsinized, counted and resuspended in a single-cell suspension in DMEM/F12 media (Gibco Cat# 11330032) supplemented with 10 ng/ml FGF2, 4 μg/ml Heparin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 5 μg/ml Insulin and 5 μg/ml hydrocortisone. Overall, 1 × 10 5 2 t P BrdU labelling Cells were seeded at 3 × 10 5 P Animal studies Mice were housed and maintained by the Animal Studies Institute at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. All animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institute for Animal Studies, and all procedures were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines. Xenograft models were generated by injection of MDA-MB-468/EM vs. M, MDA-MB-468 CT vs. MDA-MB-468/TCF1OE cells into female athymic nude mice or female NSG mice when indicated. All mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. When indicated, NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice (005557, Jackson Laboratory) were used. Tumour growth kinetics The tumour growth curve was determined by measuring tumour size twice a week using a calliper. Tumour volume was calculated using the following formula: tumour volume = shorter diameter 2 P Limiting dilution assay For the limiting dilution study, three groups of NSG female mice ( n high high high low Drug efficacy study in a mammary xenograft model For the drug efficacy study, two groups of NSG female mice (vehicle control and treatment, n high high Lung metastasis Mice bearing MDA-MB-468/EM vs. M, and MDA-MB-468 CT vs. TCF1OE mammary tumours were removed at a similar size by survival surgery and sacrificed at 3–4 months post-surgery. Lung tissues were then fixed with 10% formalin for 24 h and paraffin-embedded. Paraffin blocks were cut by a microtome (Leica Microsystems) to generate at least three serial sections at 5 μm in thickness with at least 100 μm intervals between each section. H&E staining was done on the sections by the shared core facility. Lung metastatic foci were counted, and data were displayed as mean foci number ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t P Organoid formation Primary mammary tumours excised from athymic nude mice were minced and digested in (300 Unit/ml Collagenase, type III, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 100 Unit/ml Hyaluronidase, and 5 μM of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in DMEM/F12) at 37 °C for 2 h with rotation. After red blood cell lysis was completed, tissues were incubated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min, following a second round of digestion with (1 unit/ml Dispase and 10 μg/ml DNase I in DMEM/F12) at the same condition. Live cells were counted using a Hemocytometer by mixing cell suspension with 0.4% trypan blue. In total, 1 × 10 5 t P Real-time qRT-PCR RNA was isolated using a tissue/cell total RNA mini kit from EZ BioResearch following the manufacturer’s protocol. To generate cDNA, 1 μg of total RNA was used as starting material, using the Bio-Rad iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit. The reaction mix contained 4 μl 5× iScript Reaction mix, RNA, and 1 U of Reverse Transcriptase in 20 μl reaction volume following the manufacturer’s temperature profile. Quantitative PCR reactions were carried out in 20 μl volumes in a 96-well plate (Applied Biosystems) containing 1× buffer and other PCR ingredients in SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix from Bio-Rad using an Applied Biosystem qPCR machine. Human GAPDH was used as the internal reference gene, and relative mRNA levels of candidate genes were determined using the 2(-ΔΔCT) method. Three independent experiments were performed. Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired t P Library preparation, preprocessing, and alignment for RNA-sequencing Purified total RNA was used to prepare Libraries following the protocol using Qiaseq Stranded RNA lib Kit with UDI and QIAseq FastSelect -rRNA HMR Kit (Qiagen INC.) for Illumina sequencing. Libraries were QC using Fluorometric Quantitation (Qubit; Invitrogen:ThermoFisher Scientific), Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent) and QPCR (Roche Light Cycler). RNA-seq libraries were multiplexed and sequenced as 2 ×75 bp paired-end on NEXTSEQ 500 (Illumina) following standard protocols. Sequencing data was QC and analysed using GSNAP ( http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/ http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/ DESeq http://bioconductor.org Differential expression gene analysis The statistical analysis for gene expression data was carried out using the R statistical software (version 4.2.0). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between bulk, E/M and M were identified using likelihood ratio test for the coefficient. The differential expression gene analysis was carried out using a Wilcoxon rank-sums test with Benjamini–Hochberg test for multiple testing correction. DEGs with an adjusted P Principal component analysis Principal component analysis was performed on the differentially expressed genes between bulk, E/M and M, to reveal a similar degree of transcriptional shift within the three groups. Ingenuity pathway analysis The differentially expressed genes between bulk, E/M and M were uploaded into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software for core analysis. Firstly, to investigate the potential genes that might affect global expression, the upstream regulator analysis was performed by overlaying the differentially expressed genes in Ingenuity Knowledge Database, which allows IPA to determine the activation or inhibition of potential upstream regulators. A Z-score greater than +2 or less than −2 was used as a cut-off to predict activation or inhibition. Transcription factor enrichment analysis The FOXC2 motif was obtained from the JASPAR 2022 database and used to search for genome-wide binding sites against the human hg19 genome using the HOMER (v4.11) module findMotifs. Hits of predicted FOXC2 binding sites near TP63 transcription start sites were found in both JASPAR and HOMER databases. The H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac histone mark ChIP-seq profiles from ENCODE were also used to indicate the active transcription regulatory regions and active enhancer regions of TP63, respectively. ATAC-sequencing The ATAC-seq protocol was adapted from LaFave et al [ 23 2 2 24 25 n Statistical analysis Results represent the mean ± SEM for indicated experiments with at least three independent biological replicas. The statistical methods used are described in the figure legends. Most data were analysed by the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t P Results The partial EMT state is enriched in TCF1 expression which promotes tumour stemness and metastasis TCF1 is aberrantly expressed in a subset of aggressive breast carcinomas and is associated with poor prognosis [ 26 27 high high low high high low 12 1a 1b 1b 1c 12 28 29 1d 1e 1f 1g 6 1h–k Fig. 1 The partial EMT state in MDA-MB-468 cells is enriched in TCF1, which promotes a CSC-like phenotype. a b P P c d e N P f P g P h i k i j k P P P l o N l l l n m o m o P Interestingly, the partial EMT phenotype was relatively stable in vivo as shown by the abundance of CD104/CD44/E-cad/VIM positive areas in E/M tumours (Fig. S1A low high S1B ) 1l, m 1n,o S1C S1E S1D S1F To test the effect of TCF1 on hybrid EMT, we overexpressed (OE) TCF1 in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. S2A S2A S2B high high S2C S2D S2E S2F S2G S3A, B S3A S3C, D S3E high low S3F RNA sequencing unravels FOXC2 as one of the most upregulated transcription factors in E/M cells To elucidate novel transcriptional regulators of the partial EMT state, we performed RNA sequencing comparing MDA-MB-468 E/M and M subpopulations sorted by CD104/CD44 expression from bulk cells. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed divergent transcriptomics between E/M and M or bulk cells (Fig. 2a 2b 30 2b 2b 31 2c, d 2e 32 Fig. 2 RNA-seq unravels FOXC2 as an EMT transcription factor that is restricted to E/M cells. a b c d e f g h Trp63 P i FOXC2 promotes M to E/M differentiation via p63 isoform upregulation The partial EMT state may be inherently plastic, allowing E/M cells to shift between E and M state in response to contextual TME signals. To test whether FOXC2 induces M to E/M transition we overexpressed (OE) FOXC2 in M cells from MDA-MB-468. This increased the percentage of the E/M (CD104 high high 2f 2g Next, we sought to elucidate potential candidate genes downstream of FOXC2, which may contribute to the partial EMT state, especially in the context of canonical Wnt signalling. This led us to investigate whether Trp63 33 2h 2h 2i Next, we sought to analyse the relative distribution of the p63 isoforms in E/M vs M cells and the relationship between FOXC2 and p63 isoforms. Due to a lack of non-discriminatory isoform-specific p63 antibodies to detect protein, we measured mRNA expression. Like FOXC2, TAp63 and ΔNp63 were both upregulated in E/M cells relative to M or bulk MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 3a, b 34 36 3c 3d, e 3f 37 3g, h 3i 3j–l Fig. 3 FOXC2 promotes p63 isoform expression in hybrid EMT cells. a b P c P P d e P f g i P P P j l P m P n P o P p q P P t Next, to assess whether p63 isoforms regulate the E/M state, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 isoform-specific knockout in E/M cells (Fig. 3m, n 3m, n 3o, p 3q 11 35 Wnt3a promotes transient ERK phosphorylation, resulting in FOXC2 and FOXM1 upregulation Beyond using the FOXC2/p63 axis to maintain the partial EMT state, Wnt signalling promotes self-renewal. Clearly, E/M cells were less mitotic than M cells as shown by the lower level of BrdU+ cells, consistent with a slow cycling CSC-like state (Fig. 4a 4b 4c 4d 4d high high 4e low high 4e 4f 4f 21 22 4g 19 20 4h Fig. 4 Wnt3a promotes transient p-ERK to promote E/M state maintenance and self-renewal via FOXC2 and FOXM1, respectively. a t P b c d e f g f h P P i P P j P In support of the notion that transient p-ERK promotes proliferation, treatment of E/M cells with Wnt3a stimulated S-phase entry, as measured by BrdU uptake, which peaked by 0.5 h and declined to low levels by 1 h post Wnt3a treatment (Fig. 4i 4j Wnt3a stabilises FOXC2 via Wnt/CDK4/6 mediated activation of mammary tumour growth In light of the differential effects of Wnt/ERK on FOXM1 vs 19 38 39 40 5a, b 5c 40 41 5c 5d P P P 5e Fig. 5 CDK4/6/ERK inhibition suppresses E/M stemness and self-renewal, via FOXC2 and FOXM1 inhibition, resulting in epithelial differentiation and suppression of mammary tumour growth. a b P c d P P e P f g P t P h n P i j i j N k P l m P n l Of note, although MDA-MB-468 cells are RB1 null [ 42 43 S4A S4B ERK/CDK4/6 inhibition suppresses tumour growth and organoid formation via epithelial differentiation We next sought to test the therapeutic potential of ERK/CDK4/6 drug inhibition on mammary tumour growth by E/M cells.

TCF1 potentiates canonical Wnt signalling which upregulates FOXC2, and in turn TA and ΔN p63 isoforms, which likely promote epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation via CD104 and Wnt/β-cat signalling activation [ 35 58 9 10 12 19 59 9 10 Functionally, E/M and M cells may fulfil functions that are beyond stemness; with M cells driving cell migration at the leading edge and E/M cells clustering at the core of the tumour [ 60 61 62 TF-mediated regulation of the p-EMT state may be pleiotropic and context-dependent. Intriguingly, the hybrid state was shown to give rise to early and late hybrid states with differential metastatic potential [ 8 9 high high - + + 9 59 56 We showed that FOXC2 regulates the p-EMT state via p63 isoforms, which was in turn supported by ATAC-seq analysis showing open chromatin accessibility sites at p63/p73 motifs, that were closed in M cells relative to E/M cells and reactivated in M cells overexpressing FOXC2. On the other hand, this analysis revealed that FOXC2 OE in M cells led to a closed chromatin state at the CDx2 locus (Fig. S8A 63 63 Beyond transcriptionally regulating the E/M state, FOXC2 might recruit TME factors that stabilise p-EMT. Interestingly, p63-positive E/M cells were spotted in head and neck cancers at the leading edge in close contact with CAFs which release ligands (e.g TGFβ) that stimulate EMT on the tumour end [ 64 65 S8B Importantly, our work evokes a Wnt-regulated programme underlying tumour stemness in hybrid EMT cells via ERK activation, which might be due to RAS stabilisation by Wnt/GSK3β inhibition [ 66 52 67 68 Of note, FOXM1 and FOXC2 contain ERK and CDK4/6 phosphorylation sites; however, while ERK and CDK4/6 phosphorylate/stabilise FOXM1 [ 33 69 70 71 69 72 73 Supplementary information  Supplemental material The original online version of this article was revised: The PDF version of this originally published article was the uncorrected proof; it has now been replaced by the corrected version.
