See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ The gut–liver-pancreas axis (GLPA) is a critical network shaped by gut microbiota (GM) and their metabolites, essential for maintaining metabolic and immune balance. Disruption of this microbial equilibrium, known as dysbiosis, contributes to the development and progression of various hepatic and pancreatic diseases. Through mechanisms such as increased intestinal permeability and exposure to microbial products-including lipopolysaccharide, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and secondary bile acids-dysbiosis promotes inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and carcinogenesis. These changes are linked to conditions including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, alcohol-associated liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatitis, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and diabetes. Emerging tools like stool metagenomics and serum metabolomics help identify microbial biomarkers for diagnosis and risk stratification. While interventions such as probiotics, dietary changes, and fecal microbiota transplantation aim to restore microbial balance, their success remains inconsistent. This work aims to highlight the pathogenic role of GM across the GLPA, with special emphasis on the underexplored gut-pancreas connection. Advancing our understanding of the GLPA can unlock novel microbiota-targeted approaches for early diagnosis and treatment of hepatopancreatic diseases.

These microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, interact symbiotically with the host, influencing metabolism, immunity, and barrier integrity[ 1 2 Dysbiosis-an imbalance in microbial composition-disrupts GLPA homeostasis, leading to disease. A compromised intestinal barrier permits harmful molecules like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to enter the liver, triggering inflammation via 3 4 Immune dysregulation plays a pivotal role, with dysbiosis skewing T-cell responses toward pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and away from regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Triggers of inflammasome activation exacerbate inflammation, while oxidative stress from microbial byproducts through reactive oxygen and nitrative species damages tissues, accelerating disease progression. Clinically, microbial signatures ( e.g. e.g. 5 Emerging therapies targeting the gut microbiota (GM), such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), aim to restore microbial balance. However, challenges in standardization and in-depth understanding of gut-pancreas interactions persist. While the gut-liver axis has been extensively studied, the direct interaction between the gut and the pancreas remains insufficiently explored[ 6 THE GLPA: ANATOMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK The GLPA represents a sophisticated network of anatomical and functional interactions that integrate metabolic, immune, and endocrine signaling across organs. Central to this axis is the bidirectional communication mediated by microbial metabolites, which orchestrate systemic homeostasis or, under dysbiotic conditions, drive pathophysiology[ 2 Anatomical connectivity The liver derives approximately 75% of its blood supply from the intestinal portal circulation, facilitating direct exposure to gut-derived nutrients, microbial metabolites, and endotoxins. This vascular linkage ensures that BAs, synthesized in the liver and secreted into the intestines, undergo enterohepatic recirculation-a process modulated by microbial metabolism[ 7 via e.g. via 2 Physiological mediators SCFAs, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are produced by the microbial fermentation of dietary fiber. These metabolites play crucial roles in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogen storage, and enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via e.g. 8 9 10 Dysbiosis and pathophysiological consequences Dysbiosis-defined as a pathological imbalance in gut microbial composition marked by reduced diversity, overgrowth of harmful pathobionts, and depletion of beneficial taxa[ 11 MECHANISTIC PILLARS OF AXIS-MEDIATED INJURY The gut liver pancreas axis contributes to liver and pancreatic diseases through a network of interconnected mechanisms, including intestinal barrier disruption, imbalanced microbial metabolites, and immune system dysregulation. Barrier dysfunction & endotoxemia A compromised intestinal barrier (“leaky gut”) is a hallmark of GLPA axis disruption. Dysbiosis degrades tight junction proteins ( e.g. 4 12 e.g. Proteobacteria 13 2 Harmful microbial metabolites Harmful metabolites include TMAO, derived from microbial choline metabolism, which impairs reverse cholesterol transport, promotes hepatic steatosis, and exacerbates insulin resistance[ 12 e.g. Klebsiella 14 2 Immune modulation and inflammation Immune dysregulation is a central mechanism by which gut dysbiosis contributes to liver and pancreatic pathology. Disrupted microbial composition skews host immunity through several interconnected pathways. One key pathway involves the imbalance between pro-inflammatory T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Dysbiosis favors the expansion of Th17 cells while suppressing Treg development. Th17 cells secrete cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22, which recruit neutrophils and activate inflammatory cascades that contribute to tissue injury. This Th17/Treg imbalance has been implicated in the development of MASLD, autoimmune liver diseases like primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and pancreatic inflammation[ 15 Another major mechanism is the activation of inflammasomes by gut-derived microbial components, including LPS and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These molecules activate inflammasome complexes-particularly NLRP3 and NLRP6-in both hepatic and intestinal tissues. The inflammasomes regulate the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, which drive chronic inflammation in the liver and pancreas. When dysbiosis disrupts normal inflammasome signaling, it can impair mucosal healing, increase intestinal permeability, and facilitate microbial translocation, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle of inflammation[ 14 16 Oxidative and nitrative stress represent additional mechanisms by which gut-derived microbial products contribute to tissue injury. ROS, generated in response to microbial metabolites such as ethanol and LPS, activate hepatic stellate cells, promote extracellular matrix deposition, and initiate fibrogenesis. ROS also inflicts direct damage on mitochondrial DNA, lipids, and proteins, exacerbating cellular injury. Moreover, nitrative species like peroxynitrite (ONOO — 2 17 Bidirectional crosstalk and systemic feedback The mechanistic pillars described above do not function in isolation. The GLPA is a tightly interconnected system, where dysfunction in one organ often propagates reciprocal pathology in others[ 2 18 19 20 GM and BAS The interplay between GM, BAs, and the pancreas constitutes a key component of the GLPA. The GM modifies primary BAs into secondary BAs through various enzymatic reactions, including deconjugation and dehydroxylation, thereby altering the composition and function of the BA pool[ 9 1 21 2 Figure 1  Schematic representation of bile acid relation with gut microbiota. GM IN HEPATIC DISEASES MASLD MASLD progression correlates with Bacteroides Firmicutes 22 ALD ALD is characterized by Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Proteobacteria 23 24 Primary sclerosing cholangitis Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is marked by bile duct inflammation and scarring and is associated with intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. Studies have shown reduced microbial diversity and an overrepresentation of proinflammatory genera such as Enterococcus Veillonella Streptococcus Lactobacillus Barnesiellaceae Clostridiales 14 PBC PBC is characterized by progressive bile duct destruction and is associated with significant intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. Studies have shown that PBC patients, especially those not yet treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, exhibit reduced levels of beneficial bacteria ( e.g. Bacteroidetes Ruminococcus bromii e.g. Veillonella Streptococcus Klebsiella Proteobacteria 14 Cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy Cirrhosis, characterized by severe fibrosis and hepatocyte loss, is associated with intestinal microbiota dysbiosis: Reduced Bacteroidetes Blautia Lachnospiraceae Proteobacteria Enterococcus 25 Alcaligenaceae Enterobacteriaceae Ruminococcaceae e.g. Klebsiella 26 HCC Pro-inflammatory taxa [ Escherichia coli E coli Helicobacter hepaticus Enterococcus faecalis 27 28 Viral hepatitis Chronic HBV/HCV infections correlate with reduced beneficial taxa ( Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium E. coli Enterobacteriaceae via Lachnospiraceae Bacteroidetes 29 GM IN PANCREATIC DISEASES The pancreas is indirectly influenced by GM through metabolic, immune, and inflammatory pathways described in Section “Mechanistic Pillars of Axis-Mediated Injury”. Dysbiosis can lead to bacterial translocation, alter metabolite signaling, and compromise endocrine function, contributing to a range of pancreatic disorders. Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis (AP) and CP are exacerbated by gut-derived microbial disturbance[ 30 31 Proteobacteria Actinobacteria 32 via 33 Other possible mechanisms include increased oxidative stress, imbalance of immunological homeostasis, intestinal microcirculation and barrier disturbance[ 34 35 Ruminococcus Lactobacillus Roseburia 36 via 37 PDAC PDAC is marked by an altered tumor-associated microbiota, which modulates the immune microenvironment and contributes to chemoresistance. Certain taxa may influence tumor signaling, while microbial metabolites affect the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Dysbiosis-induced inflammation and BA imbalance support tumor progression[ 38 Diabetes mellitus GM alterations contribute to both type 1 and T2D by: Inducing β-cell inflammation and apoptosis, and by modifying GLP-1 secretion and incretin responsiveness, and Promoting insulin resistance. Low butyrate levels correlate with pancreatic steatosis and impaired glucose metabolism. SCFA supplementation and dietary modulation show promise in preserving pancreatic endocrine function[ 39 CLINICAL AND THERAPEUTIC INSIGHTS: DIAGNOSTICS AND PROGNOSTICS The gut microbiome plays a key role in liver and pancreatic diseases, offering new ways to diagnose and predict outcomes. Advanced tools like stool metagenomics and blood metabolomics help identify microbial imbalances linked to conditions such as fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and pancreatic cancer. These microbial and metabolic patterns could lead to earlier detection and personalized treatments, though more research is needed (Table 1 Table 1 Clinical and therapeutic insights-diagnostics and prognostics  Disease  Key microbiota findings in the diseased person  Therapeutic strategies using probiotics/symbiotics Chronic hepatitis B Reduced SCFA-producers ( e.g. Roseburia Dialister Escherichia Shigella Proteobacteria Restoration of microbial balance via Liver cirrhosis Overgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae Lachnospiraceae Ruminococcaceae Rebalancing microbiota using synbiotics; targeted probiotics Hepatocellular crcinoma Enrichment of Proteobacteria Rothia Bifidobacterium Roseburia Prevention in aflatoxin exposure models using probiotic mixtures Across CLD spectrum Gradual decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria; increased gram-negative pathogens General microbiota modulation via Acute pancreatitis ↑ Enterococcus Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus plantarum reduced necrosis in RCTs; caution due to PROPATRIA trial findings Chronic pancreatitis ↑ Proteobacteria Firmicutes Symbiotics ( e.g. Lactobacillus Pancreatic cancer Oral: ↑ Porphyromonas gingivalis Fusobacterium Proteobacteria Probiotics may enhance chemotherapy; antibiotics may reduce gemcitabine-degrading bacteria Diabetes mellitus ↓ Faecalibacterium SCFA supplementation; dietary prebiotics FOS: Fructooligosaccharides; CLD: Chronic liver disease; SCFA: Short-chain fatty acids; RCT: Randomized control trials; SIBO: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; LPS: Lipopolysaccharide; PERT: Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Microbial signatures across hepatic and pancreatic disorders In chronic liver diseases, there is a consistent decrease in beneficial bacteria such as Firmicutes Roseburia Blautia Proteobacteria E. coli Enterococcus 40 In pancreatic diseases, AP is associated with increased Enterococcus Bifidobacterium Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes Fusobacterium nucleatum 41 Microbiota as biomarkers in pancreatic and liver cancers Pancreatic cancer is associated with distinct microbial alterations, including enrichment of Streptococcus Proteobacteria Fusobacterium Akkermansia 42 In HCC, altered GM composition includes increased Veillonella Dialister Fusobacterium 43 THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES Dietary interventions High-fiber and Mediterranean-style diets have been shown to promote the production of SCFAs by beneficial microbes such as Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus 44 45 Microbiome-based therapies Microbiota-targeted therapies are emerging as promising interventions aimed at restoring gut microbial balance and modulating host-microbiota interactions. The administration of beneficial bacterial strains or fermentable fibers, such as probiotics and prebiotics, helps re-establish a favorable microbial profile. Specific strains like Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Clostridioides difficile KEY CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS This study highlights several important avenues for future research, including the need for larger, longitudinal cohorts to validate the progression-linked microbial shifts observed from chronic hepatitis B through cirrhosis to HCC. Further investigations using metabolomics are critical to clarify the role of microbial by-products such as SCFAs, BAs, and LPSs in disease progression. Experimental studies on butyrate or acetate supplementation, particularly in animal models or clinical trials, could help define therapeutic targets. Additionally, greater focus should be placed on exploring the GLPA, as interactions between intestinal microbiota and pancreatic function remain under-investigated and may significantly influence the pathogenesis of both hepatic and pancreatic diseases. Addressing these future directions will be essential for advancing microbiome-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for chronic liver disease and its association with pancreatic dysfunction. CONCLUSION The GLPA plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic and immune balance, with the GM acting as a central regulator. Dysbiosis disrupts this axis, contributing to liver and pancreatic diseases through mechanisms such as barrier dysfunction, harmful metabolites, and immune imbalance. While emerging tools like metagenomics offer diagnostic promise, and therapies such as probiotics and dietary interventions show potential, clinical application remains limited. Future research should focus on clarifying microbial mechanisms and standardizing interventions to harness the GLPA for effective, personalized treatment strategies.
