Introduction 1.1. The Public Health and Clinical Burden of Dental Caries Dental caries remains one of the most widespread chronic conditions globally, affecting approximately 2.3 billion people and imposing a disproportionate cost burden on low- and middle-income populations [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 1.2. Advances in Microbial and Host Profiling Over the past decade, 16S rRNA sequencing has provided unprecedented detail into the microbial dimension of caries. Cross-sectional studies consistently show enrichment of Streptococcus Veillonella Lactobacillus Actinomyces 7 8 9 10 11 12 On the host side, transcriptomic profiling of gingival and dentinal tissues has revealed complementary molecular shifts. Genes involved in innate immunity, cytokine signaling, and extracellular-matrix turnover—such as MMP9 IL1B IL6 TLR2 TLR4 13 14 15 16 1.3. The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Dental Imaging and Omics In parallel, artificial intelligence—particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—has reached expert-level performance in detecting proximal caries, periapical lesions, and periodontal bone loss on bite-wing and panoramic radiographs [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 1.4. Study Objective and Conceptual Framework This study addresses these gaps by developing and validating three independent—but harmonised—deep-learning pipelines, each tailored to a distinct data modality: panoramic radiographs, supragingival microbiomes, and gingival transcriptomes. All pipelines are constructed using consistent principles of transparent preprocessing, reproducible training, and model-agnostic explanation. Specifically: A U-Net with a ResNet-18 encoder was trained on 100 expert-annotated panoramic images to compute a continuous caries-severity score based on predicted lesion area. A feed-forward neural network (FNN) was fitted to 81 supragingival 16S rRNA amplicon sequence-variant (ASV) profiles (750 taxa) following log-transformation, prevalence filtering, and Z-scoring. A second FNN was trained on 54,675 probe-level intensities from 247 gingival biopsies, with preprocessing that included log 2 Because no patient-matched radiographic severity labels were available for the microbiome and transcriptome datasets, we used random permutations of the imaging-derived severity scores as synthetic targets. These stress tests evaluated the technical stability of preprocessing, model training, and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) in high-dimensional spaces—while deferring biological interpretation until real patient-matched labels become available. It is important to note that this is a parallel proof-of-concept across independent datasets, rather than an integrated multimodal analysis of the same patients. Each pipeline was developed and validated within its own cohort, with comparability restricted to methodological robustness and interpretability, not biological integration 1.5. Twin-Cohort Validation and Study Layout Recognizing the continued scarcity of fully aligned multi-modal data, we incorporated an external validation arm: a well-characterised saliva dataset from 49 monozygotic and 50 dizygotic twin pairs [ 23 (i) subject-level alignment between microbial features and real clinical outcomes (TotalCaries count), and (ii) a natural experiment for assessing microbiome heritability via intra-pair similarity. Applying the same preprocessing and a deeper FNN architecture (2469 ASVs → 512 → 256 → 128 → 1), we evaluate both predictive accuracy and the degree of genetic influence on salivary community composition. 1.6.

Materials and Methods This section describes data acquisition, preprocessing procedures, and the design of independent machine-learning pipelines for radiographic, microbiome, and transcriptomic modelling of dental caries severity. Because the datasets do not share subject identifiers, each modality was analysed independently; cross-modal comparisons are limited to pipeline stability and interpretability. 2.1. Data Sources 2.1.1. Supragingival Plaque Microbiome Amplicon sequence variant (ASV) counts were obtained from GEO accession GSE10334 10 Streptococcus Veillonella Actinomyces Lactobacillus Fusobacterium 2.1.2. Gingival Tissue Transcriptome Probe-level gene expression intensities from 247 gingival biopsies were downloaded from the “GSE10334_series_matrix.txt” file. The dataset includes 54,675 probes reflecting host immune and structural responses to microbial challenge. Although originally collected to investigate periodontitis, this cohort spans a broad inflammatory spectrum and captures several molecular signatures relevant to caries—such as upregulation of MMPs and cytokines [ 14 15 2.1.3. Panoramic Radiographs A total of 100 full-size panoramic dental radiographs and associated binary caries masks were retrieved from the open-source Kaggle repository (“images_cut,” “labels_cut”). The fraction of carious pixels in each image was computed to define a continuous radiographic severity score. Although bite-wing radiographs typically provide higher resolution for interproximal caries detection, they were not available in open-access, mask-annotated form at the time of analysis. We therefore utilised cropped panoramic radiographs as a pragmatic choice to enable reproducible segmentation experiments. 2.1.4. External Validation Panoramics Fourteen paediatric panoramic radiographs and their pixel-wise tooth masks were taken from the open-access *Children’s Dental Panoramic Radiographs Dataset for Caries Segmentation and Dental Disease Detection* [ 24 Section 2.5 2.1.5. Twin-Cohort Saliva Microbiome Salivary 16S rRNA data for 49 monozygotic (MZ) and 50 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (n = 198 samples) were acquired from Figshare (Kasimoglu et al. 2020 [ 12 2.2. Multi -Pipeline Strategy We implemented four unimodal pipelines: A supragingival microbiome FNN, A gingival transcriptome FNN, A radiographic U-Net, and A twin-cohort microbiome branch. The supragingival and transcriptomic pipelines lack subject-level caries scores. Therefore, each sample in these two datasets was assigned a synthetic target—generated by random permutation of the radiographic severity scores (see Section 2.3.3 In contrast, the twin-cohort dataset includes real outcomes: recorded TotalCaries counts per child and inherent biological structure (MZ vs. DZ). This branch enables: (i) estimation of microbial heritability via intra-pair Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, and (ii) evaluation of the FNN architecture using genuine clinical labels. 2.3. Preprocessing Rationale for synthetic targets. Public microbiome and transcriptome cohorts with caries labels remain scarce. We therefore used randomly permuted severity vectors strictly as a stress test of data-handling and explainability; no biological inference was drawn. This approach, which mirrors software unit-testing, ensures that once patient-matched labels become available, the same pipelines can be executed without code modification. 2.3.1. Microbiome (Supragingival) ASV counts were already log 10 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 2.3.2. Transcriptome Raw probe intensities were log 2 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 2.3.3. Radiographs Images and masks were cropped, resized to 512 × 256 px and intensity-scaled to [0, 1]. Caries severity was computed as: S e v e r i t y = ∑ m a s k _ i j / H × W 2.3.4. Twin-Cohort Preprocessing ASVs present in ≤20% of samples were excluded, resulting in a 2469 × 198 matrix. Remaining counts were log 10 2.4. Model Architectures Architectural details, including input dimensions, layer configurations, and training strategies for each unimodal pipeline, are provided in Table 1 2.5. Evaluation For the microbiome and transcriptome pipelines (with synthetic labels), performance was evaluated via five-fold cross-validation, repeated three times. Metrics: Mean squared error (MSE) Coefficient of determination (R 2 Pearson correlation (r) For the U-Net model, a 20-image hold-out set was used. Metrics: Intersection-over-Union (IoU) Precision Recall Tooth-area precision on an external paediatric set (n = 14): proportion of predicted lesion pixels that fall inside the dilated tooth mask (dilation = 5 px; sigmoid threshold = 0.50) For the twin cohort: Bray–Curtis dissimilarity: two-sample t-test (α = 0.05) comparing MZ and DZ pairs Twin FNN: MSE, R 2 2.6. Interpretability Checks For both molecular FNNs, SHAP values were computed to estimate feature importance. The top 20 contributing ASVs or genes were visualised in horizontal bar plots. PCA and k-means clustering confirmed that SHAP-selected features corresponded to latent structure in the data. Gene-set enrichment (via GSEApy) was executed as a technical pipeline test but was not biologically interpreted due to the use of synthetic labels. 2.7. Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate All datasets analysed in this study are fully de-identified and publicly available: Supragingival plaque ASV and microarray data were downloaded from GEO accession GSE10334 Panoramic radiographs and masks originate from the open-access “Panoramic Dental Caries” Kaggle dataset, containing no personal identifiers. Twin-cohort saliva microbiome data were obtained from Figshare and were published with parental consent and ethics approval. As no new human data were collected, this re-analysis of de-identified public data is exempt from additional IRB approval (per Section 3.1 2.8.

Current Limitations Synthetic labels were used for the microbiome and transcriptome pipelines, and external radiograph masks label whole teeth rather than lesions. Accordingly, SHAP and GSEA results in those arms should be interpreted strictly as technical validations. Definitive biological insights will require future patient-matched datasets that combine radiographic, microbial, and transcriptomic measurements for the same individuals. 3. Model Architecture This section describes four independent machine-learning pipelines—targeting supragingival microbiome, gingival-tissue transcriptome, panoramic radiographs, and a saliva-based twin cohort—each designed to extract caries-severity signals. Because no subject IDs are shared across these datasets, models were trained and evaluated separately. Cross-modal analyses focus on pipeline robustness and interpretability, not biological integration. The study addresses three methodological aims: (i) prediction of a continuous caries severity proxy, (ii) identification of influential features using SHAP, and (iii) validation of performance using either synthetic severity scores or real clinical labels. 3.1.

Radiograph Segmentation Pipeline Panoramic X-rays and their masks (n = 100) were manually cropped to the dentition region, resized to 512 × 256 pixels, and intensity-scaled to [0, 1]. A U-Net with a ResNet-18 encoder (ImageNet-pretrained) was fine-tuned to segment carious regions.

Twin-Cohort Microbiome Pipeline Following the removal of ASVs present in ≤20% of samples, the saliva matrix contained 2469 ASVs across 198 children (49 MZ, 50 DZ pairs). Counts were log 10 Heritability: Bray–Curtis dissimilarities calculated per twin pair; MZ vs. DZ differences tested via two-sample t Prediction: An FNN (2469 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 1) trained to regress TotalCaries count using: ◦ 80/20 train–validation split (random seed = 42) ◦ Early stopping (patience = 20 epochs) ◦ Adam optimiser (learning rate = 0.001, weight decay = 1 × 10 −5 3.6.

Distribution of Radiographic Caries-Severity Scores Radiographic caries severity was defined as the fraction of carious pixels in each 512 × 256 segmentation mask (see Section 2.3.3 Figure 11 4.2. Supragingival Microbiome FNN After prevalence filtering (>20% non-zero values) and Z-scoring, ~400 ASVs were retained across 81 supragingival plaque samples. Across 15 cross-validation folds (five-fold CV × 3 repeats), the FNN yielded: Mean MSE = 0.0008 ± 0.0003 Mean R 2 Mean Pearson r As expected under synthetic labels, the model exhibited no predictive signal.

Aggregate Performance Summary Table 4 2 4.7. Study Limitations However, important limitations persist: Synthetic targets: The use of permuted labels in the microbiome and transcriptome pipelines precludes current biomarker interpretation. Cohort mismatch: Lack of aligned subjects prevents any cross-modal integration or causal inference. Sample size: Cohorts remain small by machine-learning standards (81 plaque, 247 biopsy, 100 images, 198 saliva), limiting statistical power and architectural complexity. Imaging heterogeneity: Differences in scanner hardware, patient age, and acquisition protocols may depress U-Net performance; harmonised imaging repositories are needed. We relied on cropped panoramic radiographs rather than bitewings, which generally offer higher spatial resolution for detecting early lesions. This choice reflects the availability of open datasets rather than an optimal imaging modality, and should be considered when interpreting radiographic performance. 5. Discussion This study evaluated whether three distinct data modalities—supragingival microbiome profiles, gingival-tissue transcriptomes, and panoramic radiographs—could each support independent machine-learning pipelines in the absence of subject-level alignment. Additionally, we introduced a fourth, biologically grounded cohort—salivary 16S rRNA data from monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs—to provide external validation and quantify heritability. While predictive performance was constrained by the lack of matched labels for two of the pipelines, all models executed successfully end-to-end, and biologically meaningful signal emerged once genuine outcomes were available. 5.1. Microbiome Pipeline Following log-transformation, prevalence filtering (>20% non-zero), and Z-score standardisation, the FNN trained on 81 supragingival plaque samples converged stably with a mean cross-validation MSE of ~8 × 10 −4 2 r Streptococcus Veillonella 7 8 9 5.2. Transcriptome Pipeline In the absence of a publicly available caries-labelled transcriptomic dataset, we repurposed GSE10334 2 Under synthetic targets, the transcriptomic FNN showed stable convergence (mean R 2 MMP9 IL1B IL6 TNF 13 14 15 16 5.3. Radiographic U-Net Training a ResNet-18-based U-Net on 100 panoramic radiographs produced segmentation performance within the expected range for caries-detection models (IoU = 0.564; precision = 0.624; recall = 0.877) [ 17 18 19 r p 5.4. Twin-Cohort Validation To validate model performance under real clinical labels, we analysed 198 saliva samples from twin pairs (49 MZ, 50 DZ) with recorded TotalCaries counts [ 12 Heritability: Bray–Curtis dissimilarity was significantly lower in MZ than DZ pairs (0.475 ± 0.107 vs. 0.557 ± 0.117; t p Caries prediction: Re-using the FNN architecture from §3.2 (input = 2469 ASVs), we obtained MSE = 91.8, R 2 r 5.5. Integrative Context Taken together, the results highlight the feasibility of constructing modular, interpretable machine-learning pipelines for individual data modalities, even in the absence of subject alignment. The radiographic U-Net emerges as a scalable tool for generating continuous severity scores, which may be retrospectively assigned to microbial or transcriptomic samples obtained from the same visit, unlocking label supervision for future multimodal learning. The molecular pipelines are technically validated and poised for biological discovery pending availability of real labels. SHAP-based feature attribution and optional pathway enrichment (via GSEApy) are already integrated, allowing downstream identification of discriminative taxa, transcripts, and pathways—e.g., IL-1β While the three unimodal pipelines and the twin cohort provide complementary perspectives, they do not derive from the same individuals. Accordingly, this work should be viewed as a parallel demonstration of modular deep-learning strategies, not a combined multi-omic study. Future integrative insights will require truly patient-matched datasets. Recent syntheses on multi-omics + imaging + AI in precision dentistry underscore the same data-alignment barriers we note here and outline feasible integration paths we plan to follow [ 26 27 28 Despite limitations outlined in Section 4.7 Beyond its role as a proof-of-concept, the framework also offers immediate practical applications for researchers. First, the radiographic pipeline can be reused as an automated severity quantifier in retrospective imaging datasets, providing a standardised measure of lesion extent without requiring manual charting. Second, the microbiome and transcriptomic branches can be deployed as stress-tests for preprocessing and model stability, enabling validation of computational workflows before undertaking costly patient-matched recruitment. Finally, the twin-cohort analysis highlights a heritable component of oral microbial structure that can be leveraged in the design of future longitudinal cohorts. Together, these practical steps make the modular architecture directly usable in current research while paving the way toward integrated, label-aligned studies. We emphasise that this study does not yet close the gap of patient-matched, multimodal integration. Instead, it provides a computational foundation that future, label-aligned cohorts can directly build upon. Key Contributions. Taken together, this work establishes: A radiograph-derived continuous gold-standard suitable for downstream molecular training, Heritable structure in oral microbial communities, with predictive signal detectable even by simple architectures, A modular, open-source, and interpretable machine-learning pipeline that can be rapidly extended by the broader research community. Future Directions. To advance from technical feasibility to future clinical translation, we identify four critical priorities: Integrated cohort design: Future studies should prospectively recruit participants from whom plaque or saliva, gingival biopsies, and radiographs are obtained on the same visit, accompanied by validated clinical indices (e.g., DMFT, ICDAS). Multi-input learning architectures: Incorporating dual-branch or attention-fusion neural networks capable of simultaneously ingesting microbial and transcriptomic features, with outputs regressing directly to severity scores or clinical outcomes. Longitudinal sampling: Repeated, time-stamped multi-omic and imaging measurements will be essential to model lesion initiation, progression, and response to intervention. Wet-lab validation: Molecular candidates identified by SHAP or pathway enrichment should be corroborated by qPCR, metagenomic sequencing, or cell-culture assays—particularly taxa such as Streptococcus mutans Processed-data release: A final priority is the design of prospective cohorts that collect radiographs, plaque or saliva microbiomes, and gingival transcriptomes at the same clinical encounter; even if raw files cannot always be released, providing harmonised processed datasets would greatly foster reproducibility and external validation. Open science and reuse. By releasing all code, data links, and model weights in a reproducible format—including Colab-compatible notebooks and detailed README instructions—this study delivers a ready-made scaffold for the next generation of multi-modal, precision-dentistry pipelines. 5.6. Comparison with Prior Studies While deep-learning frameworks for caries detection on radiographs and microbiome-based classifiers are well-established, studies that combine multiple omics or integrate radiographic and molecular data remain rare. Table 5 Recent literature (2020–2025). Multiple recent studies and reviews report strong performance of AI for caries detection on bitewings/panoramics and related modalities, reinforcing our imaging findings and discussion of limitations. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses from 2024–2025 synthesised diagnostic accuracy and study quality across radiographic AI models [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Key takeaways: Most prior studies are unimodal, and even those with multiple data types rarely include aligned subjects. Interpretability is often limited to visual saliency maps; few pipelines incorporate SHAP or gene-pathway analysis. The ZOE 2.0 initiative is label-aligned and large but lacks imaging and relies on dmft/DMFT scores. To our knowledge, no prior work integrates 16S, transcriptome, and radiographic data in a unified framework. These comparisons underscore both the novelty and limitations of our approach. Going forward, large-scale, label-aligned, longitudinal studies that jointly profile imaging, microbiome, transcriptome, and host genetic features will be essential to realise precision dentistry. 6. Conclusions This study presents a proof-of-concept computational framework showing that supragingival 16S profiles, gingival-tissue transcriptomes, and panoramic radiographs can each be independently processed and modelled within a modular deep-learning architecture, even in the absence of patient-level alignment. The radiographic pipeline achieved IoU = 0.564 (95% CI 0.535–0.594), precision = 0.624 (0.583–0.667), recall = 0.877 (0.827–0.918) on a hold-out set, with severity scores correlating with lesion area (r = 0.62). Twin-cohort analyses showed lower Bray–Curtis dissimilarity in MZ vs. DZ twins (0.475 ± 0.107 vs. 0.557 ± 0.117; p r Overall, these findings demonstrate that modular, interpretable pipelines operate robustly across heterogeneous datasets and provide a reproducible foundation for future multimodal oral-health research.

This histogram shows, for each of the 750 ASV features, the fraction of samples in which that ASV’s count is zero. ASVs appearing in fewer than 20% of samples (i.e., >80% zeros) were filtered out (right-hand tail). Figure 2 Variance per ASV (Post-filter). After removing those sparse ASVs, we computed each remaining feature’s variance across 81 samples. This histogram illustrates the spread of variances among filtered ASVs, guiding us toward selecting highly variable taxa. Figure 3 PCA of Microbiome Samples (Top 20 ASVs). We Z-score normalised only the top 20 most variable ASVs and plotted each sample in the first two principal components. This scatter illustrates the clustering of samples based on the most variable features. Figure 4 Clustered Heatmap of Top 20 Variable ASVs (Z-scores). A hierarchical clustering of the 81 plaque samples (rows) on the left produces the row dendrogram, showing which samples share similar Z-score profiles across the top 20 ASVs. The heatmap cells ( centre top Figure 5 Distribution of Raw Intensities (Sample of 1000 Values). A random subsample of 1000 raw microarray intensities (across ~54,675 probes and 247 samples) shows a heavy right skew, with many low-intensity values and a long tail of high intensities. The orange line shows the kernel density estimate (KDE), a smoothed approximation of the underlying distribution that highlights the overall shape beyond the binning of the histogram. Figure 6 Distribution After Log 2 2 Figure 7 Distribution After Quantile Normalisation. Quantile normalisation produces a roughly bell-shaped distribution (narrower range), aligning each sample’s intensities to the same distribution—a prerequisite for reliable cross-sample comparisons. The green line shows the kernel density estimate (KDE), a smoothed approximation of the underlying distribution that highlights the overall shape beyond the binning of the histogram. Figure 8 Variance Across Genes (Post-transform). Each of the ~54,675 probes now has a computed variance after log 2 Figure 9 PCA of Transcriptome Samples (Top 20 Genes by Variance). Analogous to the microbiome PCA, we scaled the top 20 most variable genes, performed PCA, and plotted each sample in PC1 vs. PC2. This reveals any natural groupings based on gene-expression heterogeneity. Figure 10 Extended multimodal deep-learning pipeline for caries severity modelling and validation. The schematic shows three unimodal data paths (microbiome, transcriptome, radiograph) producing continuous severity outputs, each subjected to SHAP interpretation. A fourth path analyses the twin cohort: Bray–Curtis dissimilarity quantifies heritability, and an FNN predicts TotalCaries. Arrows indicate computational flow; dotted lines represent interpretability modules. All layer sizes and preprocessing steps correspond to Section 3.2 Section 3.3 Section 3.4 Section 3.5 Figure 11 Distribution of computed caries severity scores (mask-area fraction) across 100 panoramic radiographs. Most images fall below a 0.006 fraction, with a long tail extending to approximately 0.013.

Summary of input dimensions, layer configurations, and training strategies for the four modality-specific models. The microbiome and twin pipelines use fully connected feed-forward networks with ReLU activation and Adam optimiser (learning rate = 0.001). The transcriptome model includes dropout layers (rate = 0.3) to mitigate overfitting due to high feature dimensionality. The radiographic pipeline employs a U-Net with a ResNet-18 encoder and optimises a combined Dice and binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. The twin-cohort model includes early stopping with a validation patience of 20 epochs on an 80/20 data split.
