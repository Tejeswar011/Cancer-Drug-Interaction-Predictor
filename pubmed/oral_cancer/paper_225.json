While GP is not harmful, it can cause psychological distress. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin C injection for managing GP compared to the standard scalpel surgery. Methods The study involved 20 healthy patients aged 19–36. A randomized split-mouth design was used, with vitamin C injections (group 1) on one side and scalpel surgery (group 2) on the other side of the maxilla. Clinical evaluations of gingival depigmentation were conducted preoperatively and at first, second, three weeks and six months postoperatively, using the Gingival Pigmentation Index (GPI), Melanin Pigmentation Index (MPI), Dummett Oral Pigmentation Index (DOPI) and Color Intensity Analysis using ImageJ. Pain and patient satisfaction were measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS) after treatment. Results The GPI, MPI, and DOPI showed no significant differences in pigmentation between the groups at baseline and after six months ( P P P P P Trial registration This randomized controlled trial was retrospectively registered in the Thai Clinical Trial Registry at 05-7-2024 ( www.thaiclinicaltrials.org Keywords Gingival pigmentation Gingival depigmentation Vitamin c Scalpel surgery pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Background The aesthetics of a smile are significantly influenced by the arrangement, morphology, and color characteristics of both the teeth and gingival tissue. The appearance and health of the gingiva are particularly crucial in creating an appealing smile. Generally, the gingiva presents a shade of pink, although this color may vary among individuals due to differences in skin pigmentation. Factors such as the degree of keratinization of the epithelium, the presence of pigment-containing cells, the vascular supply, and the distance to the surface all contribute to variations in gingival color [ 1 2 Gingival hyperpigmentation is characterized by darker gingival tissue beyond the normal range [ 3 4 5 6 Several pathological causes of gingival pigmentation include endocrine disorders (e.g., Addison’s disease, Acromegaly), exposure to heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury), malignant neoplasms (e.g., Kaposi’s Sarcoma), drug-induced pigmentation (e.g., from minocycline, zidovudine), mucosal conditions (e.g., lichen planus, hemoglobin disorders), tobacco-related pigmentation (smoker’s melanosis), idiopathic conditions (e.g., Peutz-Jegher’s syndrome), and various forms of tattoos (e.g., amalgam, graphite) [ 7 Gingival hyperpigmentation is often a genetically inherited trait in certain populations, known as racial or physiological gingival pigmentation. Notably, its prevalence does not show gender disparities. Individuals with darker skin tones are more likely to have pigmented gingiva, while those with fairer skin are less likely [ 8 9 Evaluation of gingival pigmentation usually relies on clinical indexes such as DOPI, GPI, MPI, and de Krom categories [ 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 Several surgical techniques are employed for gingival depigmentation, including scalpel surgery [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 The scalpel surgical technique, or split-thickness epithelial excision, removes gingival epithelium with a scalpel, allowing connective tissue to heal by secondary intention and resulting in a lighter, melanin-free appearance [ 20 29 4 30 30 31 Recent literature indicates no significant differences in depigmentation results or wound healing between surgical scalpel depigmentation and diode laser methods for managing physiological gingival melanosis. Although diode lasers lead to less postoperative pain and bleeding, the scalpel technique demonstrates better healing for depigmented wounds. Both methods are equally effective in promoting wound healing, and repigmentation can occur with either technique [ 32 33 Vitamin C has a notable impact on melanocytes, affecting their function and the interaction between melanocytes and keratinocytes. Disruption in this interaction can influence melanin production. Vitamin C binds to melanin, leading to its fading, and higher doses can result in gingival depigmentation [ 34 25 35 36 37 38 39 Most studies on gingival melanin depigmentation are limited to case reports [ 40 41 36 42 44 37 39 45 47 39 45 46 47 Materials and methods Calculation of the sample size The sample size was determined using G*power v3.1.9.2 based on the effect size from Chhina et al. [ 18 Ethical approval The study was approved by the ethics committee of Sanaa University (Approval No. 2022/477) and adhered to the Helsinki Declaration (1975, revised 2013). We conducted a split-mouth clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of vitamin C injections and scalpel surgery for gingival depigmentation, registered with the Thai Clinical Trial Registry (TCTR20240715003). All participants were informed and consented prior to participation. Recruitment of patients and inclusion/exclusion criteria From March 2022 to July 2023, 20 patients seeking treatment for melanin pigmentation in the aesthetic region were assessed for eligibility at the Faculty of Dentistry, Sanaa University. Inclusion criteria were physiological gingival pigmentation in the aesthetic region, aesthetic concerns, ages 18 to 50, and good overall health. Exclusion criteria included a thin gingival phenotype, periodontitis, history of drug use causing pigmentation, smoking, pregnancy or lactation, and inability to attend follow-up visits. Randomization Eligible patients were randomly assigned using a computer-generated system ( https://www.randomizer.org/ 1  Fig. 1 The CONSORT flow diagram Preoperative preparation phase Depigmentation protocols included professional scaling using ultrasonic scalers and comprehensive oral hygiene instructions to ensure optimal oral health conditions before any procedure. Preoperative clinical measurements At the start, all patients underwent preoperative clinical measurements, including the plaque index (PI) [ 48 49 24 50 10 Study procedures Vitamin C injection procedure The site was anesthetized using 2% lidocaine with adrenaline 1:80.000. An intragingival injection of vitamin C at a concentration of 250–375 mg (Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Co.) was administered using a 30-gauge syringe. The needle was bent at 45° with a bevel of the needle oriented upward and inserted parallel to the superficial gingival tissue. The needle was inserted to a depth of 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm at intervals of 2 mm to 3 mm (Fig. 2 37 47 3 4 Scalpel surgery procedure Local anesthesia was administered via infiltration using 2% lidocaine with adrenaline (1:80,000) at the surgical site. The pigmented epithelial layer and a thin connective tissue layer (partial thickness incision) were scraped with a No. 15 scalpel blade. Surgical depigmentation began at the midline and progressed laterally, ensuring the blade remained parallel to the tooth axis to avoid severing the junctional epithelium or exposing the underlying bone. Subsequently, the exposed connective tissue surface was carefully examined, and the wound was irrigated with saline (Fig. 2 3 4  Fig. 2 A B  Fig. 3 Case presentation images: A B C D E F  Fig. 4 A B Outcomes evaluation Gingival pigmentation was assessed using gingival and melanin indices at baseline, three-weeks post-procedure, and six months post-operatively. Standardized digital photographs were captured using a 12MP camera and analyzed for color intensity with ImageJ software [ 51 5 6  Fig. 5 Preoperative photograph bordered ( A B Fig. 6 Analysing the intensity values using ImageJ software: A B C D Patient pain and itching were evaluated using the VAS, divided into vertical (itching) and horizontal (pain) Sections [ 52 18 53 Statistical analysis Data was collected, computed, and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Color intensity values showed a normal distribution. Group comparisons were conducted using independent sample t-tests ( p p Results No adverse events were observed after consent and enrollment. Participants’ ages ranged from 19 to 36 years, with an average of 27.5 years. Repigmentation occurred in 6 out of 20 patients (30%) during the six-month follow-up, with higher recurrence noted in cases of heavy pigmentation, particularly on the surgical side. There were no significant differences in pigmentation between the scalpel surgery and vitamin C injection groups at baseline and after six months, based on GPI, MPI, and DOPI results ( P P P P P P 1 2 3  Table 1 Comparison of the pigmentation at baseline, after one, two, three weeks, and six months later between the two groups using GPI Time Treatment GPI Mean Std.

In a clinical comparison using GPI and MPI, the baseline mean GPI was 2.65, decreasing to 1.95 after one week and 1.05 after three weeks. Similarly, the baseline mean MPI was 1.80, declining to 1.45 after one week and 0.95 after three weeks, showing a statistically significant difference from baseline to six months. Color assessment software, specifically ImageJ, revealed no significant differences in color intensity between the two groups at baseline and after six months ( P P 7  Fig. 7 Comparison of the color intensity (CI) between groups (sides) The vitamin C injection side exhibited lower levels of pain and itch compared to the scalpel surgery side. After one week, there was a significant difference in itch ( P P P Discussion Gingival pigmentation is a prevalent concern in terms of aesthetics, prompting individuals to seek treatment despite its non-medical nature. While it poses no health risks, many desire its removal for cosmetic reasons [ 29 54 20 37 44 47 Vitamin C is renowned for its antioxidant properties and depigmenting abilities. It has been successfully administered through intradermal, intramucosal, and topical routes [ 25 29 34 44 55 56 Our study compared the efficacy of intragingival vitamin C injections and scalpel surgery for gingival depigmentation using a split-mouth RCT design with a six-month follow-up, aiming to advance depigmentation techniques and improve patient care. Minimizing inter-individual variability among groups is essential in treatment research, as it can influence baseline conditions and treatment responses. Consequently, a split-mouth study design was employed in this study to eliminate confounding factors like patient’s sex, age, and pigmentation level, allowing for a more precise comparison and improving the internal validity of the findings. Furthermore, the significance of RCTs lies in their ability to reduce bias and enhance the reliability of study outcomes. We found no significant differences in pigmentation between the scalpel surgery and vitamin C injection groups at baseline and six months. However, significant depigmentation occurred in the surgical group at one, two, and three weeks. The DOPI showed similar results, with more depigmentation initially on the surgical side. Although the vitamin C group experienced less pain one-week post-treatment, satisfaction levels were similar after six months. Overall, scalpel surgery achieved faster and more pronounced depigmentation, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that vitamin C injections are equally effective. Our results align with previous studies. Yussif et al. observed similar improvements in gingival color when comparing scalpel surgery and vitamin C mesotherapy, further supporting the efficacy of both treatments [ 37 26 47 At the six-month follow-up, a higher rate of recurrence was observed in cases with heavy pigmentation, particularly on the surgical side. This finding in contrast to previous studies by Yussif et al. [ 34 37 47 ImageJ analysis showed a significant difference in mean values for the vitamin C side during injection visits, with increased gingival lightness. However, no significant difference was found between the last visit and follow-up visits. This aligns with Shamida et al. who noted a greater lightness increase after four weeks of ascorbic acid gel but no significant difference between 8 and 12 weeks [ 25 Regarding pain and itch, the vitamin C injection group reported lower pain and itch levels than the scalpel surgery group, consistent with previous studies [ 34 37 44 37 47 44 This study offers valuable insights while indicating areas for future research, including long-term pigmentation recurrence after vitamin C treatment and its adjunct use with surgery. Further exploration of refined vitamin C dosage and delivery methods to enhance early efficacy is needed, along with larger studies and longer follow-ups to validate these findings and inform clinical protocols. The study found that vitamin C injections were less effective than surgery for initial depigmentation, with surgery achieving greater results at three weeks. However, by six months, the differences were no longer significant, indicating comparable long-term outcomes. While vitamin C injections had lower pain and itch levels and were better tolerated, overall effectiveness in terms of patient satisfaction was similar to surgery. These results underscore the need for further research to confirm the long-term efficacy of both methods. This study had several limitations, including a small sample size and the exclusion of smokers and individuals with systemic diseases, which further limit its applicability. The focus on anterior gingiva also means that patients with broader smiles were not fully considered. Although the split-mouth design helps control variability, it may introduce bias due to patient awareness of the treatments, and the lack of blinding could affect outcome assessments. Lastly, as a preliminary study with a short duration, it may not adequately reflect long-term adverse effects or outcomes. Future research should aim for larger, more diverse populations, longer follow-ups, and double-blind designs while using objective measures of treatment effectiveness. Conclusions Within the limitations of this study, it could be concluded that both scalpel surgery and vitamin C injection procedures were found to be safe for treating gingival hyperpigmentation, with no adverse events reported during the study. Furthermore, vitamin C injection was as effective as surgery and provided better tolerability with reduced pain levels than surgical methods, although patient satisfaction ratings were similar for both approaches.
