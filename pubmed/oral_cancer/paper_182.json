Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical emergency condition, with 15–35% of patients developing coagulopathy, increasing risks of secondary brain injury and mortality. We developed a machine learning model to predict coagulopathy in TBI patients in the emergency room. Using data from 322 TBI patients (mean age 55.7 ± 21.1 years, coagulopathy incidence 15.8%) at Chongqing Ninth People’s Hospital (2018–2024), we collected clinical and laboratory data (GCS scores, blood counts, liver function). Data were preprocessed in R, using SMOTE for class imbalance and selecting top 70% features by information gain. Among 11 algorithms, Random Forest (RF) achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.92, recall = 0.94, false negative rate = 6%), outperforming coagulation tests. Neutrophil percentage, A/G ratio, and ALT were key predictors, reflecting inflammation and liver dysfunction. SHAP analysis enhanced model interpretability. This model supports rapid risk stratification for early intervention, though multi-center validation is needed. traumatic brain injury coagulopathy machine learning emergency medicine feature importance SHAP analysis risk stratification The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Globally, an estimated 50 million TBI cases occur annually, significantly increasing mortality and disability risks and presenting a major public health challenge ( 1–3 4–6 5 7 8 9–11 Currently, coagulation function assessment relies on traditional testing methods such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). However, these methods are time-consuming (typically requiring tens of minutes to hours) and have limited sensitivity for trauma-induced coagulopathy ( 12–15 5 16 17 Machine learning (ML) can integrate high-dimensional data to discover predictive patterns that traditional statistical methods struggle to capture, demonstrating superior potential to conventional models in trauma medicine. While recent ML applications in emergency risk stratification have significantly improved prediction accuracy, research on rapid prediction of TBI-associated coagulopathy remains limited, with existing models often lacking interpretability or real-time applicability. This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based prediction model using routine clinical and laboratory data available in emergency departments to rapidly identify high-risk TBI patients for coagulopathy, supporting early intervention and facilitating precise emergency management. 2 Methods 2.1 Data source This study utilized the TBI database from Chongqing Ninth People’s Hospital, collecting clinical and laboratory data from emergency department TBI patients between January 2018 and December 2024. The target was to predict whether patients would develop coagulopathy (binary variable). Coagulopathy was defined as elevated International Normalized Ratio (INR ≥ 1.2) or prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT, reference range 28–34 s) ( 14 18 19 Figure 1 Figure 1 Technical roadmap of this study. Flowchart detailing the processing of a traumatic brain injury database with 658 cases. 405 cases met the inclusion criteria, and 322 passed the exclusion criteria. 83 cases had missing key data. Steps include data preprocessing with cleaning and feature engineering, model selection with evaluation and tuning, model training with performance evaluation and error analysis, and model interpretation with global and local analysis. 2.2 Data preprocessing Data preprocessing was completed in R 4.3.3 environment. The dataset was split in a 7:3 ratio (stratified sampling to ensure balanced coagulopathy proportions) into training and testing sets. The R package “dplyr” (V1.1.4) ( 20 21 22 23 2.3 Model selection and rapid screening To select appropriate machine learning algorithms, the mlr3 framework was used to preliminarily evaluate the default parameter performance of 11 models, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost, Elastic Net Regularized Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Single-Layer Neural Network. The evaluation process employed 5-fold cross-validation, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the primary metric, supplemented by accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The best-performing Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Support Vector Machine were selected for hyperparameter tuning. 2.4 Hyperparameter tuning Random Forest optimization parameters included number of trees (100–500), number of features for splitting (2–12), minimum node size (1–8), and maximum number of nodes (3–10), using random search (50 iterations) via the R package “mlr3tuning” (V1.3.0) ( 24 25 2.5 Final model training and evaluation Random Forest, showing the best performance, was selected as the final model, with optimal hyperparameters (number of trees = 225, features for splitting = 8, minimum node size = 2, maximum nodes = 5) used for retraining on the complete dataset, configuring probability output to support subsequent analysis, implemented through the mlr3 framework. Model performance was evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation, reporting mean and median values of AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, along with confusion matrix analysis of classification error distribution. Out-of-bag error of Random Forest was used to verify the adequacy of decision tree quantity. The model output coagulopathy probability, optimized based on the ROC curve, with a probability threshold of 0.6 (corresponding to SHAP value>0.7) selected to balance sensitivity and specificity. 2.6 Model interpretation To enhance model interpretability, global and local analysis methods were employed. At the global level, the DALEX package calculated feature contributions to predictions through Dropout Loss, with results visualized as bar charts using the R package “ggplot2” (V3.5.1) ( 26 27 2.7 Statistical analysis Statistical description and analysis were completed in R 4.3.3 environment. Continuous variables were described as mean±standard deviation, categorical variables as frequency (percentage), group comparisons used Wilcoxon rank-sum test or chi-square test, with significance level set at p 3 Results 3.1 Clinical characteristics of the cohort Between 2018 and 2024, emergency department admitted 658 acute TBI patients, of whom 405 met preliminary inclusion criteria.

RF demonstrated excellent discriminative ability (AUC = 0.92, median cross-validation AUC = 0.91) and recall (Recall = 0.95, median cross-validation Recall = 0.93), outperforming other candidate algorithms (such as Gradient Boosting Machine and Support Vector Machine). With a training time of only 2.3 min and false negative rate as low as 6%, the model significantly outperforms traditional coagulation tests (such as INR and APTT), which are limited by long processing times and inconsistent diagnostic thresholds ( 12–14 4.1 Model performance and clinical significance The excellent performance of the RF model benefits from its powerful capability to process high-dimensional, heterogeneous data ( 28 5 7 8 6 17 29 p 30 12–15 31 32 Notably, this study prioritized optimizing AUC rather than recall, although the latter is typically more critical in emergency settings ( 33 34 Additionally, the coagulopathy incidence reported in this study (15.8%) is lower than the 35% mentioned in the introduction ( 4–6 4.2 Key predictors and their mechanisms Feature importance analysis indicates that the percentage of neutrophils, A/G ratio, ALT, hemoglobin (Hb), neutrophil count, white blood cell count, GCS score, and lymphocyte percentage are core factors in predicting TBI-related coagulopathy. Neutrophil percentage was the primary predictor, confirming that the inflammatory cascade reaction triggered by TBI is a core driver of coagulopathy ( 5 35 36 37 38 5 39 40 41 42 43 13 44 45 46–48 49 4.3 Clinical application scenarios This model can be integrated into emergency decision support systems, supporting the following scenarios: (1) High-risk patient stratification: SHAP value>0.7 corresponds to model prediction probability>0.6; based on cross-validation recall>0.93 and false negative rate<6%, it is suitable for identifying high-risk patients and prioritizing thromboelastography testing to guide individualized blood transfusion (such as fibrinogen concentrate). (2) Dynamic monitoring: inputting updated laboratory data every 6 h within 24 h after admission to dynamically update prediction probabilities and capture delayed coagulopathy. (3) Resource optimization: prioritizing intensive care resources for high-risk patients and optimizing emergency processes. Combined with “damage control” strategies (such as tranexamic acid), effects can be further enhanced ( 50 4.4 Strengths and limitations The main strengths of this study include: (1) Utilization of real-world data, enhancing the model’s generalizability; (2) Application of SMOTE technique to address data imbalance, ensuring the model’s predictive ability for the minority class (coagulopathy group) ( 51 52 53 4.5 Future directions The RF model in this study provides an effective tool for rapid prediction of TBI coagulopathy, but there remains room for improvement. First, multi-center studies could validate the model’s generalizability and include broader patient populations (such as different races, age groups, or patients with comorbidities). Second, exploration of deep learning methods (such as convolutional neural networks) or time series analysis could capture dynamic changes in coagulation status after TBI. Additionally, combining bedside coagulation testing technologies (such as thromboelastography) might further enhance the model’s real-time capability and accuracy. Finally, developing a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on this model and evaluating its actual impact on patient outcomes through randomized controlled trials would be an important direction for future research. 5 Conclusion This study demonstrates that a Random Forest-based machine learning model can efficiently predict coagulopathy risk in emergency department TBI patients, with high discriminative ability and clinical utility. Neutrophil percentage, A/G ratio, and ALT play key roles in prediction, suggesting inflammation and liver dysfunction as important drivers of coagulopathy. Despite certain limitations, this model provides a new tool for precise risk stratification in emergency medicine, laying the foundation for improving TBI patient outcomes.
