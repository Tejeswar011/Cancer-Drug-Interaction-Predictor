Background Whether environmentally relevant exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributes to frailty remains unknown. We examined urinary VOC metabolites (VOCms) and their mixtures in relation to frailty in a nationally representative U.S. cohort. Methods We analysed 2,715 adults (≥ 20 y) from NHANES 2011–2018 in a cross-sectional design. Frailty was defined with a 48-item index. Sixteen creatinine-adjusted VOCms were quantified. Single metabolites were evaluated with survey-weighted logistic regression. Two-directional weighted-quantile-sum regression (WQS), grouped Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and quantile g-computation (qgcomp) characterized mixture effects, and sex- and age-stratified subgroup analyses were performed. Mediation by γ Results Four metabolites—DHBMA, CEMA, HPMMA and MHBMA3—were each positively associated with frailty (adjusted OR per log₁₀-unit 1.67–2.59). The positive WQS index increased frailty odds by 25% (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.17–1.33), whereas the negative index lowered odds by 17% (OR = 0.83, 0.75–0.91). Only the positive index remained significant in men and in adults ≥ 65 y; MHBMA3 dominated male weights (18%), HPMMA female weights (16%). BKMR confirmed a monotonic dose–response for the positive group, whereas qgcomp detected no overall effect. Bilirubin and albumin jointly mediated 5–20% of the associations; GGT showed no significant mediation. Conclusion Urinary VOCm mixtures are linked to frailty at population exposure levels, with risk driven by four metabolites and most pronounced in men and older adults. Oxidative stress explains part—but not all—of the association, suggesting additional pathways. Reducing VOC exposure may help preserve physiological reserve; longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm causality. volatile organic compounds frailty oxidative stress mixture modeling weighted quantile sum NHANES The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Aging and Public Health 1 Introduction Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a diverse class of gases emitted from fuels, plastics, solvents, and tobacco smoke; once absorbed, many are conjugated with cysteine and excreted as mercapturic-acid metabolites of VOCs (VOCms), providing an objective record of internal dose ( 1 2 These pollutants are virtually ubiquitous: more than 90% of U.S. adults carry detectable urinary levels of at least one VOCm ( 3 4 5 6 7 8 Frailty, a multidimensional syndrome of diminished physiologic reserve, has emerged as an overarching indicator of healthy ageing, predicting disability, hospitalization, and mortality better than single-organ metrics ( 9 10 −3 11–13 In the past five years, nationally representative NHANES analyses and large Asian cohorts have mapped the health footprint of urinary VOC metabolites. Two NHANES studies tie urinary VOCms to ageing outcomes: elevated DHBMA and CEMA, together with N-acetyl-S-(3-hydroxypropyl-1-methyl)-L-cysteine (HPMMA), predicted 30–60% higher sarcopenia odds, while a mixture dominated by N-acetyl-S-(2-cyanoethyl)-L-cysteine (CYMA) was inversely related to the anti-ageing protein α 14 15 4 16 17 α Pollution-frailty research has grown in parallel.

Positive and negative mixture effects were estimated with two-directional weighted-quantile-sum regression and verified with quantile g-computation. Key metabolites were then identified by LASSO penalized selection and examined in direction-specific Bayesian kernel machine regression to delineate dose–response functions.

Figure 1 Participant selection flowchart. Flowchart detailing participant selection for a study from the NHANES database between 2011-2018. Starting with 39,156 participants, exclusions were made for those under 20 years (16,539), lacking urine creatinine data (8,591), or with insufficient urine mVOCs data (3,757). From 5,969 meeting criteria, further exclusions were made for incomplete frailty indices (3,254), leaving 2,715 participants for analysis. Final analyses focused on associations with individual and mixed mVOCs, and mediation effects. 2.2 Exposure Participants provided non-fasting urine samples, stored at −70 °C until analysis. Urinary VOCms were quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry using stable isotope-labeled internal standards. We emphasize that all laboratory analyses were conducted by the National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as part of the NHANES biomonitoring program. The LC–MS/MS workflow, including sample preparation, chromatographic separation, mass spectrometry conditions, and the use of isotope-labeled internal standards, followed standardized CDC laboratory protocols, which are publicly available in the NHANES Laboratory Method Files. The analyzed VOC metabolites included 2-methylhippuric acid (2-MHA), 3,4-methylhippuric acid (3,4-MHA), N-Acetyl-S-(2-carbamoylethyl)-L-Cysteine (AAMA), N-Acetyl-S-(N-methylcarbamoyl)-L-Cysteine (AMCC), 2-amino-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (ATCA), N-Acetyl-S-(benzyl)-L-Cysteine (SBMA), N-Acetyl-S-(n-propyl)-L-Cysteine (BPMA), mandelic acid (MA), N-Acetyl-S- (4-hydroxy-2-butenyl)-L-Cysteine (MHBMA3), phenylglyoxylic acid (PGA), as well as DHBMA, CEMA, HPMMA, and CYMA. In accordance with established practices in NHANES VOC biomonitoring research, we excluded VOCms for which more than one-third (>33%) of participants had concentrations below the analytical limit of detection (LOD) or had identical values across all participants. This threshold is commonly applied to minimize bias from heavily censored data and to ensure sufficient variability for reliable statistical modeling ( 18 19 20 2.3 Covariates We adjusted for a set of demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle variables that have been consistently associated with both VOC exposure and frailty in prior epidemiological research ( 21 22 Supplementary Table 1 2.4 Outcome Frailty was assessed with the 48-item NHANES Frailty Index described in earlier studies ( 23 24 Supplementary Table 1 25 26 2.5 Statistical analysis Missing covariates were imputed with KNN using the VIM package, preserving multivariable structure; family income showed the highest missingness (10.9%). Baseline characteristics were analyzed using survey-weighted methods to account for the NHANES complex sampling design. Continuous variables were reported as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, while categorical variables were presented as survey-weighted percentages and compared using the Rao–Scott adjusted χ 2 Urinary VOCm concentrations were adjusted for urinary creatinine and log-transformed to normalize their distributions. These transformed VOCm levels were entered into survey-weighted logistic regression models both as continuous variables and as quartiles (with Q1 as the reference group) to evaluate their associations with frailty. To assess mixture effects, we applied direction-specific Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression. Urinary VOCms were categorized into quartiles to reduce skewness and limit the influence of extreme values. Separate positive and negative WQS indices were modeled, with each metabolite assigned a weight reflecting its relative contribution to the mixture effect ( 27 28 a priori We further performed quantile-based g-computation (qgcomp), a recently developed approach for mixture analysis that simultaneously estimates the overall effect of increasing all exposures by one quantile while allowing both positive and negative contributions of individual components. This method was implemented using the qgcomp R package, following the framework described by Keil et al. ( 29 30 Complementing the WQS and qgcomp analyses, we used Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) to further examine potential non-linear and interactive effects among VOCms. To improve computational efficiency and minimize noise from variables with negligible associations, we first applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to the full set of urinary VOC metabolites. The subset of VOCs retained by LASSO was then entered into the BKMR models. Metabolites selected by LASSO were grouped according to the direction of their crude association with frailty (positive or negative) and analyzed in separate BKMR models. BKMR models provided estimates of overall mixture effects, subgroup-specific effects for positively and negatively associated metabolites, and variable importance, expressed as group posterior inclusion probabilities (groupPIP) and conditional posterior inclusion probabilities (condPIP). Each model was run for 10,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations to ensure convergence, with stability verified through inspection of trace plots and convergence diagnostics ( 31 32 To explore potential effect modification, stratified analyses were conducted by sex (men vs. women) and by age group (< 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years). In each subgroup, WQS, qgcomp, and BKMR models were re-run using the same covariate adjustments as in the primary analyses. Stratified analyses were also stratified by smoking status (current, former, and never smokers), with WQS and BKMR models re-estimated using the same covariate adjustments as in the main analyses. Additionally, to further explore potential synergistic and antagonistic effects within the mixture, we calculated the urinary DHBMA/SBMA concentration ratio (after creatinine standardization and log-transformation) and evaluated its association with frailty using survey-weighted logistic regression models. The ratio was analyzed both as a continuous variable and by quartiles. Recognizing oxidative stress as a putative molecular catalyst of frailty ( 8 γ 33 34 Supplementary Table 2 Each analysis decomposed the total effect (TE) into a direct effect (DE) and an indirect effect (IE) operating through the mediator(s); the proportion mediated was calculated as IE/TE. Statistical inference relied on non-parametric bootstrapping with 1,000 resamples to generate survey-weighted 95% confidence intervals for DE, IE, and TE. All mediation models adjusted for the same covariates used in the primary analyses.

Panel B and C are line graphs plotting the h(Z) frailty against quantiles, indicating variability. Panel D is a table listing groups of mVOCs with corresponding groupPIP and condPIP values, showing ATCA with the highest condPIP. In the positive index, the largest weights were assigned to DHBMA (22%) and HPMMA (21%), followed by CEMA (13%) and MA (8%). 3,4-MHA, CYMA and 2-HPMA each accounted for 5–7%, and no other metabolite exceeded 5%. The negative index was led by SBMA (17%), AAMA (12%) and 2-MHA (10%). ATCA, MHBMA3 and 3-HPMA contributed 8–10%, while every remaining metabolite contributed less than 6%. In a sensitivity analysis using LASSO-selected metabolites within the WQS framework, the results remained consistent with those from the primary WQS model, further supporting the robustness of our findings ( Supplementary Figure 4 To confirm robustness, we ran a quantile g-computation analysis, which showed no overall association (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.86–1.21; p Supplementary Figure 5 3.3.2 BKMR analysis To address multicollinearity and pinpoint influential VOCms, we ran 10-fold cross-validated LASSO logistic regression ( Supplementary Figures 6, 7 Supplementary Table 4 We then fitted three separate BKMR models to explore the overall and direction-specific mixture effects of these metabolites on frailty.

First, in single-metabolite analyses we observed consistent, exposure-dependent associations for four urinary VOC metabolites—DHBMA, CEMA, HPMMA, and MHBMA3. Modeled as log₁₀-transformed continuous variables, each metabolite was positively related to frailty, with fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.67 to 2.59 per one-unit increase in concentration. When the same metabolites were categorized into quartiles, participants in the highest quartile (Q4) had 1.65- to 1.97-fold higher odds of frailty than those in the lowest quartile (Q1), reaffirming a monotonic, dose-responsive pattern. Second, when the 16 metabolites were treated as a mixture in two-directional weighted-quantile-sum (WQS) regression, we observed a clear bidirectional pattern: a one-unit increase in the positive-direction index was associated with a 25% increase in frailty odds, whereas a one-unit increase in the negative-direction index corresponded to a 17% decrease. Sex- and age-stratified WQS models showed that this risk-increasing (positive) index remained significant only in men and in adults ≥ 65 y; within that index, DHBMA dominated the weights in men (18%), whereas HPMMA led in women (16%), signaling sex-specific drivers. Third, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) built on LASSO-selected positive and negative groups corroborated these findings: the positive group displayed a monotonic, upward exposure–response curve, while the negative group showed no consistent relationship, reinforcing the notion that risk is concentrated in a small subset of metabolites. Fourth, causal-mediation analysis indicated that oxidative-stress markers—particularly albumin and bilirubin—mediated 5–20% of the associations for the four key metabolites, implicating oxidative imbalance as a partial pathway. Beyond conventional hepatic oxidative stress markers, we incorporated OBS and hs-CRP to strengthen the biological plausibility of the pathway interpretation. OBS provided partial evidence of oxidative imbalance mediation for DHBMA, while hs-CRP mediated the effect of CEMA on frailty. Notably, hs-CRP results were limited to NHANES 2015–2018, which may restrict generalizability and attenuate statistical power. A robustness check using quantile g-computation (qgcomp) produced a null overall mixture estimate. Urinary mercapturic acids are increasingly recognized as sensitive sentinels of systemic VOC exposure. Earlier NHANES studies linked higher VOCm burdens to hypertension, metabolic syndrome and sarcopenia, suggesting that solvent exposure affects multiple organ systems ( 4 19 35 36 37 38 39 The risk-increasing component of the mixture is driven by four metabolites—DHBMA, CEMA, HPMMA, and MHBMA3—whose epoxide or aldehyde groups readily deplete glutathione and initiate oxidative-stress cascades ( 40 41 42 43 44 45 The main risk metabolites—DHBMA, CEMA, HPMMA, and MHBMA3—originate from VOCs (1,3-butadiene, acrylonitrile, crotonaldehyde) that form reactive epoxides or aldehydes, deplete glutathione, and generate ROS ( 41 46 47 γ Smoking is a well-recognized source of VOC exposure. In our stratified analyses, associations between urinary VOC metabolites and frailty were more evident among current smokers, while results were less consistent in former and never smokers. This suggests that smoking status influences the detectability of VOC–frailty relationships. Nevertheless, several of the key VOCs identified, including 1,3-butadiene, crotonaldehyde, and xylene, also derive from environmental and occupational sources unrelated to tobacco smoke. Thus, while smoking remains an important contributor, it does not fully explain the observed associations. Residual confounding by smoking-related exposures cannot be entirely excluded and should be considered when interpreting our findings. This study is the first to relate urinary VOCm mixtures to frailty in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. By integrating three complementary mixture approaches—direction-specific WQS, grouped BKMR, and qgcomp—together with oxidative-stress mediation, we were able to triangulate risk estimates and pinpoint sex- and age-specific drivers. The convergent signal across WQS and BKMR highlights a small subset of metabolites (DHBMA, CEMA, HPMMA, MHBMA3) as principal hazards, with mediation analysis indicating that systemic oxidative imbalance could represent one possible mechanism underlying the observed associations. These results reinforce the notion that VOC control could promote healthier ageing trajectories. Several caveats temper these conclusions. First, the NHANES design is cross-sectional; directionality and causality cannot be established. Second, exposure was assessed from a single spot-urine sample, which is susceptible to within-person variability and may misclassify long-term exposure—bias that would generally attenuate associations. Third, qgcomp yielded a null overall estimate; this likely reflects its lower statistical power when a mixture contains components with opposing effects, but it nonetheless underlines the need for caution in interpreting borderline associations. Fourth, residual confounding is possible, and sample sizes for sex- and age-stratified analyses were modest, limiting precision. Finally, NHANES is representative of the U.S. population; since VOC sources and exposure levels may differ across countries, the generalizability of our findings to other populations should be interpreted with caution. Future work should couple repeated urinary and blood measurements with personal air monitoring, apply high-resolution exposomic and multi-omics panels, and follow participants longitudinally to confirm temporality, delineate additional pathways—such as endocrine or mitochondrial disruption—and test whether targeted VOC-reduction strategies can meaningfully delay frailty onset. 5 Conclusion Urinary VOCm mixtures—driven by metabolites DHBMA, CEMA, HPMMA, and MHBMA3—are linked to greater frailty, especially in men and adults ≥ 65 y. Oxidative stress mediates part of this risk, yet most effects remain direct. Controlling environmentally relevant VOC exposure could support healthier ageing; longitudinal confirmation is warranted.
