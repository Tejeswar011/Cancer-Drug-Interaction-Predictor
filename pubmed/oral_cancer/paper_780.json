It regulates a range in physiological and pathological processes, including chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, diabetes, and kidney disorders, all of which contribute significantly to global health and socioeconomic burdens [ 3 4 5 1 2 CB 1 2 6 7 1 2 8 9 10 Plant-derived cannabinoids, such as (–)-Δ9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential. Beyond the psychoactive effects of THC, cannabis plants contain over 140 phytocannabinoids, many of which lack psychoactive properties but exhibit health-promoting effects [ 11 12 13 14 15 The pharmaceutical industry has made substantial progress in developing CB 1 2 1 2 16 17 18 19 Despite these advances, challenges persist. Not all diseases benefit equally from CB 1 2 20 21 1 2 The ECS represents a promising frontier for therapeutic innovation, with CB 1 2 This Special Issue of Pharmaceuticals 1 2 By addressing knowledge gaps and innovative approaches, the articles in this Special Issue aim to catalyze the advancement of ECS research into tangible therapeutic applications. Together, these contributions highlight the potential of ECS modulation to revolutionize the treatment of human diseases and lay a foundation for further progress in this exciting field. The study by Filipiuc et al. (contribution 1) investigated the acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of an EU-GMP-certified Cannabis sativa Williams et al. (contribution 2) explored the therapeutic potential of CBD and its synthetic analog HU308 in mitigating HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs). HANDs, driven by chronic inflammation and viral persistence in the CNS, remain prevalent despite combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). The study showed that CBD and HU308 reduced extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral RNA (TAR and env), along with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α). Using in vitro models, 3D neurospheres, and a humanized mouse model, HU308 combined with low-dose cART provided significant reductions in viral replication and inflammation compared to cART alone. These findings suggest that CBD and HU308 may complement cART in addressing HANDs by targeting both viral and inflammatory pathways. Criscuolo et al. (contribution 3) combined computational screening and experimental validation to identify FDA-approved drugs with CB 1 3 1 1 Green et al. (contribution 4) used molecular modeling and mutagenesis to identify key residues for positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) at CB 1 3.27 2.56 1 Martin et al. (contribution 5) examined FAAH inhibition for sleep promotion in TauP301S (PS19) mice, a model of neurodegeneration. Pharmacological FAAH inhibition improved sleep behaviors, but complete genetic FAAH knockout failed to prevent sleep loss, neuroinflammation, or cognitive decline. These results suggest FAAH as a promising sleep-promoting target in neurodegenerative diseases, though dosing and timing require further investigation to avoid potential long-term drawbacks. Campos et al. (contribution 6) reviewed drug–cannabinoid interactions in therapies for epilepsy, autism, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and pain. Cannabinoids, particularly THC and CBD, influence cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP3A4), altering the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs. Examples include CBD increasing clobazam levels in epilepsy and interfering with tamoxifen metabolism in cancer. The review emphasizes the need for personalized monitoring of drug interactions to optimize therapeutic efficacy and minimize toxicity. López-Tofiño et al. (contribution 7) studied cisplatin-induced changes in the ECS of male rats to understand chemotherapy side effects. A single subnoxious dose of cisplatin caused significant ECS alterations, including reduced MAGL expression in the gastrointestinal system and nervous system changes resembling chronic pain conditions. These findings suggest ECS modulation as a potential strategy to mitigate chemotherapy-induced toxicities. Gong et al. (contribution 8) demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor effects by combining AXL inhibition with the cannabinoid WIN55212-2. The combination reduced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, enhanced apoptosis, and increased CD8 + Thapa et al. (contribution 9) showed that combining low-dose THC with either ZCZ011 or CBD effectively alleviated DSS-induced colitis in mice. The combinations improved inflammation markers, restored GLP-1 homeostasis, and mitigated metabolic complications without significant toxicity. This synergistic approach offers a safer therapeutic strategy for ulcerative colitis, targeting both inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Pérez-Morales et al. (contribution 10) reviewed the role of CB 1 2 1 2 1 Thapa et al. (contribution 11) reviewed the endocannabinoidome (eCBome) as a therapeutic target for IBD and its extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs). Modulating the eCBome offers potential for managing systemic complications like arthritis and liver dysfunction in addition to intestinal inflammation. The review highlights the need for mechanistic studies to leverage the eCBome for holistic IBD management. Together, these contributions emphasize the potential of ECS modulation to revolutionize therapeutic strategies, addressing a wide range of human diseases and laying a foundation for future research and clinical applications.
