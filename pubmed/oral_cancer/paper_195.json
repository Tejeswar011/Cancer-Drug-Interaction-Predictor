Summary In patients who have undergone laryngectomy followed by permanent tracheostomy, managing the airway for one‐lung ventilation during lung surgery may present a challenge for anaesthetists. This case report discusses a 45‐year‐old man with a permanent tracheostomy after a laryngectomy performed for laryngeal carcinoma 5 years ago. He was scheduled to undergo excision of a right bronchial mass for which one‐lung ventilation was required. An adjustable Flange Hyperflex™ Tracheostomy tube (Bivona® Silicone Tracheostomy tube, Smiths Medical ASD, Inc., Gary, Indiana, USA) was used for this purpose and the tube was guided into the left main bronchus with a bronchoscope. Appropriate lung isolation was achieved using this technique, and there were no airway‐related complications during or after the surgery. This case report shows that a Hyperflex™ tracheostomy tube can be successfully utilised in challenging airway scenarios in patients with a tracheostomy, where other options may not be feasible. laryngectomy one‐lung ventilation tracheostomy pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date July‐December 2024 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.4.9 mode:remove_FC converted:03.10.2024 1 Senior Resident, 2 Professor, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India ",
