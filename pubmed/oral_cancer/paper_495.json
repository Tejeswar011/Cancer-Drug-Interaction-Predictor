Abstract Background Scalp discoid lupus erythematosus in Caucasians is still a rare disease with a variable clinical presentation. Its dermoscopic characteristics are poorly described in literature, especially in the white population. The aim of this review was to critically analyze published papers on this topic and summarize relevant features. Summary A comprehensive search for eligible articles was conducted in the databases of MEDLINE/PubMed. Results were analyzed following dermoscopic patterns such as follicular openings, hair shafts, perifollicular surface, and vessel pattern. Key Messages The most representative features appeared the absence of follicular openings and the presence of follicular keratotic plugs, along with yellow-brown and red dots. In long-lasting lesions with chronic stage, trichoscopy showed the absence of follicular openings, white or milky red cicatricial patches, white and brown structureless areas, and thick arborizing vessels.
