Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the progressive deterioration of cartilage, alterations in subchondral bone, and synovial inflammation [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 OA can be classified into two main forms: primary (idiopathic), with no known cause, and secondary, which is typically associated with trauma, metabolic diseases, or other joint disorders. Moreover, different clinical and molecular phenotypes have been proposed, including inflammatory, senescence-associated, pain-persistent, and metabolic syndrome-related subtypes, reflecting the disease’s heterogeneity and suggesting that personalized therapies could improve clinical outcomes [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Figure 1 The treatment of OA includes a range of strategies, from pharmacological interventions to surgical options, all aimed at relieving pain and improving joint function [ 4 20 21 Figure 2 Polyphenols, such as curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, and propolis-derived molecules including pinocembrin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester, have attracted interest in osteoarthritis because they mitigate pro-inflammatory signaling (e.g., NF-κB), activate cytoprotective pathways (Nrf2/HO-1), and reduce catabolic mediators implicated in cartilage breakdown (e.g., MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5) [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 This review synthesizes advances in OA pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms, and evaluates emerging therapeutic strategies, with a special focus on polyphenols and nanotechnology. We integrate mechanistic data with nanocarrier-mediated exposure and retention, align mechanisms with clinically meaningful endpoints (pain, function, imaging), classify evidence maturity using tiered labels, and outline practical priorities to facilitate clinical translation. 2. Structural Homeostasis of Cartilage and Chondrocyte Activation in OA This section provides a concise mechanistic background to frame the translational analysis that follows. We highlight the organization of the osteochondral unit and the pro-inflammatory and oxidative cascades most relevant to osteoarthritis (NF-κB activation, ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction, and MMP/ADAMTS-driven matrix loss). The osteochondral tissue exhibits a hierarchical organization composed of three interconnected layers: the articular cartilage on the surface, a transitional zone formed by calcified cartilage (CCL), and the underlying subchondral bone, which mainly consists of trabecular tissue. Within the cartilage, the structure is zonally divided into superficial, middle, and deep regions, each with a distinct cellular and ECM composition, providing specific structural and mechanical properties at each level [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 The superficial zone accounts for 10–20% of the total cartilage thickness and contains thin, densely packed collagen fibers aligned parallel to the articular surface, with flattened chondrocytes tightly arranged [ 37 38 The calcified cartilage layer (CCL), located between deep hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone, transmits mechanical load and mediates cartilage–bone crosstalk. In OA, structural changes (tidemark duplication, thickening, microcracks) reflect failed repair, permit vascular invasion and pathological mineralization, and impair its barrier function, making the CCL a promising target for tissue-engineering approaches [ 39 40 41 42 3. Factors Contributing to the Pathophysiology of OA: Aging, Mechanics, Angiogenesis, and Genetic and Epigenetic Aspects The prevalence of OA increases with age and is one of the leading causes of disability among older adults, driven by mechanisms such as oxidative stress and the weakening of the musculoskeletal system [ 43 44 45 NK4a 46 Articular cartilage is constantly subjected to mechanical forces such as stress, strain, and pressure, which, when excessive, can cause cellular apoptosis and accelerate tissue degeneration [ 47 48 49 Finally, genetic and epigenetic factors significantly contribute to OA susceptibility and progression. Genetic studies have identified multiple risk loci, with an estimated heritability of 60% in the hip, 40% in the knee, and up to 65% in the hands [ 50 51 47 52 Collectively, these processes are interdependent. Aging promotes chondrocyte senescence and a SASP milieu that heightens sensitivity to inflammatory cues and oxidative stress [ 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 2 60 4. Importance of Interleukin-1β in OA: Therapeutic Implications IL-1β has been reported to destroy joint cartilages by restricting the synthesis of anabolic substances such as collagen and proteoglycans, while increasing the production of catabolic substances such as MMPs and ADAMTS, as well as promoting chondrocyte apoptosis [ 42 61 Beyond its canonical pro-inflammatory role, IL-1β signaling in OA is amplified by mechanotransduction: inflammatory cues sensitize PIEZO1-mediated Ca 2+ 62 63 (EPAS1) 64 65 Several IL-1β antagonists, such as lutikizumab, show unsatisfactory results in clinical trials, highlighting the need to explore new active molecules that target IL-1β inhibition as a strategy to combat OA [ 65 66 67 68 5. Molecular Pathways and Molecules Involved in OA Understanding of the mechanisms underlying OA has focused on the structural and functional changes in joint tissues, as well as a variety of molecular biological processes involving various cells and cytokines. In addition, cell signaling pathways have been observed to influence their progression [ 69 70 5.1. NF-κB Pathway in OA The NF-κB pathway plays a key role in the pathology of OA, as it is linked to cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation, and subchondral sclerosis. It regulates the expression of genes related to degradative metabolism, such as MMPs and ADAMTS5 71 72 NF-κB is the central pro-inflammatory hub in OA chondrocytes, driving COX-2, iNOS, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5; yet, despite robust preclinical inhibition, randomized trials directly targeting IL-1/NF-κB in knee OA have shown limited or inconsistent benefit, supporting a shift toward upstream/mechano-immune modulation and exposure-matched designs [ 73 74 75 76 77 78 5.2. Nrf2 and Its Role in Antioxidant Response and Cellular Protection Nrf2/Keap1 is the dominant antioxidant axis in osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Natural activators (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, sulforaphane) have poor or variable bioavailability; nano-enabled formulations are, therefore, required to improve stability and exposure (and, for intra-articular use, residence time and safety) [ 79 80 81 82 5.3. ADAMTS and ADAMs in the Degradation of ECM in OA A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) and A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motif (ADAMTS) are key enzymes in the maintenance of organ and tissue homeostasis, but they are also involved in the pathology of OA. Inhibition of ADAM-17 is considered a promising strategy for reducing inflammation in OA [ 83 ADAMTS5 72 84 5.4. MMPs: Regulators of Cartilage Remodeling and Degradation in OA MMPs, zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes, play an essential role in the degradation of articular cartilage ECM in OA. They are widely distributed in connective tissues and participate in the degradation of aggrecan, a distinctive feature of OA [ 58 MMP13 85 72 5.5. FOXO1 in Cellular Homeostasis and Cartilage Metabolism TGFβ signaling is critical for joint tissue development and cartilage homeostasis. Studies with transgenic mouse models have provided detailed knowledge about the key molecules in this pathway and their involvement in OA, allowing for tissue-specific, cellular, and temporal regulation [ 86 87 FoxO1 is mainly expressed in bone and cartilage, regulating the development of bone tissue and chondrocyte homeostasis. FoxO1 interacts with Runx2 and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to regulate osteoblast differentiation and energy metabolism [ 88 89 90 91 88 92 Research on signaling pathways in OA reveals several potential therapeutic targets ( Table 1 6. Therapeutic Strategies and Emerging Trends in OA and Cartilage Regeneration 6.1. Therapies Based on Natural Products 6.1.1. Propolis: Composition, Properties, and Applications in OA Propolis, a natural product made by bees, stands out for its biological and pharmacological properties, attributable to its complex chemical composition, which includes more than 300 compounds such as resins, waxes, aromatic oils, pollen, amino acids, minerals, sugars, phenols, and terpenes [ 93 94 95 96 97 98 6.1.2. The Role of Polyphenols in Osteoarthritis Polyphenols play multifaceted roles in OA by dampening inflammatory signaling and catabolism while supporting cytoprotective responses. Curcumin suppresses IL-1β/OSM-induced MMP expression in human chondrocytes via NF-κB inhibition and has broad chondroprotective actions in preclinical models [ 99 100 101 102 103 104 22 2 105 Table 2 106 Clinical evidence and limitations (polyphenols). Randomized trials of curcuminoid formulations report short-term symptomatic benefit (e.g., non-inferiority to ibuprofen over 4 weeks; superiority to placebo over 6 weeks) [ 107 108 109 110 Table 3 Polyphenols, secondary metabolites of plants, are characterized by phenolic rings and hydroxyl groups that give them antioxidant properties, useful for neutralizing ROS and nitrogen (RNS) [ 114 115 116 117 118 Research has shown the potential of polyphenols to protect articular cartilage from degeneration. Leong et al. (2014) highlighted the effect of epigallocatechin 3-gallate from green tea in murine models, attributing its protective action to the regulation of proteoglycan homeostasis. Clinical trials also showed improvements in joint function and pain reduction following consumption of apple powder polyphenols [ 119 2 2 120 121 95 122 123 6.1.3. Main Bioactive Compounds: Pinocembrin and CAPE Pinocembrin, a flavanone present in plants and products such as propolis, stands out for its ability to modulate cell metabolism and biochemical pathways, showing promising effects in inflammatory, cardiovascular and oxidative stress-related diseases. This compound activates the transcription factor Nrf2, promoting the expression of antioxidant enzymes, and has shown benefits in models of neurodegenerative diseases and cardiac dysfunction through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, in addition to inhibiting NF-κB signaling and advanced glycation end products [ 124 125 126 Evidence tier: Preclinical. Pinocembrin has been shown to reduce levels of catabolic factors, such as NO/iNOS, PGE2/COX-2, and MMPs, by inhibiting the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in human OA chondrocytes treated with IL-1β. In addition, it can suppress NF-kB signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IkBα and p65, as well as by suppressing the nuclear translocation of NF-kB [ 24 127 128 CAPE, a natural derivative of caffeic acid, is considered one of the most promising bioactive components present in propolis [ 129 17 16 4 130 131 Evidence tier: Preclinical. CAPE carries out its anti-inflammatory activities by modulating different inflammatory pathways, including inhibition of NF-κB transcription factors. CAPE inhibits NF-κB activation, suppressing IκBα degradation and p65 phosphorylation in gastric cancer cells, suggesting its therapeutic potential in inflammation. Some studies show that CAPE also inhibits NF-κB by suppressing the interaction of NF-κB with DNA, not just blocking the degradation of IκBα [ 132 133 134 135 To address CAPE’s poor aqueous solubility and chemical instability, β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes and protein/peptide-based nanoparticles have been shown to increase solubility, preserve bioactivity, and improve delivery profiles, offering immediately translatable strategies that complement the SPN approach detailed below [ 136 137 138 CAPE and pinocembrin, bioactive compounds in propolis, stand out for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which positions them as promising agents in the treatment of OA. CAPE inhibits NF-κB signaling by preventing IκBα degradation, reducing inflammation and cartilage degradation. Moreover, pinocembrin activates the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which counteracts oxidative stress and indirectly impacts inflammation. Its encapsulation in nanoparticles could improve its stability and bioavailability, optimizing its therapeutic use in OA. 6.2. Nanotechnology to Improve the Bioavailability of Polyphenols and Bioactive Compounds: Applications in OA Treatments Although the consumption of polyphenols helps in the prevention of diseases, their oral administration without protection results in a low efficiency at the site of action. This is due to several factors, such as concentration, binding site, chemical structure, stability in the gastrointestinal environment, and aqueous solubility, which together negatively affect absorption levels, degree of metabolization, distribution in the body, shelf life, and excretion of the compound [ 139 140 141 142 143 Antioxidant activity and polyphenol composition in pigmented grain extracts were evaluated after digestion and transport across Caco-2 intestinal cells, showing a significant reduction in antioxidant activity after digestion [ 144 145 Nanotechnology is presented as an optimal solution to address the limitations in the delivery and bioavailability of polyphenols, through various nano and micro encapsulation techniques. These methods include inorganic solid nanoparticles, nanometals such as gold and silver, liposomes, surfactant micelles, and extracellular vesicles. In addition, polymeric nanoparticles, various types of lipid vesicles, cyclodextrin complexes, prebiotic/probiotic-based systems, nanocrystals, and semisolid systems have been explored [ 146 147 148 Nanocarriers face challenges, such as their complex chemical design, limited payload capacity, and high costs. Their widespread use as part of formulations can pose risks to patients, especially at high doses. Therefore, exploring nanocarriers with therapeutic properties could reduce the amount of drugs and carriers needed, which in turn could minimize side effects and improve treatment efficacy for patient benefit [ 149 Data suggest that the solubility and local exposure of polyphenols are improved, but successful translation depends on reproducible CMC/GMP processes and long-term joint safety. Therefore, priorities should include batch reproducibility, stability assessment, biodistribution studies, and the development of a standardized chronic safety package. Among intra-articular delivery systems, triamcinolone acetonide extended-release (PLGA microspheres) has shown clinically meaningful, months-long pain reduction versus placebo and standard crystalline steroid in randomized studies [ 111 112 113 Table 3 150 151 152 6.3. Nanotechnology-Enhanced Delivery Systems for OA Intra-articular (IA) platforms, including lipid, polymeric, and hybrid/inorganic systems, aim to extend joint residence and reduce systemic toxicity; clinical plausibility hinges on measured IA retention, repeat-dose joint safety, and reproducible CMC/GMP. This section focuses on IA exposure and retention, alignment with clinically used endpoints (pain, function, imaging), and manufacturability under GMP with long-term joint safety. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems have shown significant promise in augmenting the therapeutic impact of bioactive agents in OA, notably polyphenols and natural anti-inflammatory compounds. Key advantages include controlled release, targeted delivery to joint tissues, improved solubility and chemical stability, longer intra-articular residence, and decreased systemic toxicity [ 153 154 6.3.1. Lipid-Based Nanocarriers Translational focus: establish joint retention and head-to-head comparisons with the same payload and demonstrate true delivery gains, together with standardized immunocompatibility and repeat-dose joint safety. Evidence tier: Preclinical. Liposomes, due to their ability to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, have gained traction. Recent studies demonstrated that intra-articular liposomal lubricants significantly suppress shear-stress–induced expression of catabolic genes (e.g., MMP-3, IL-1β) in preclinical OA models [ 155 156 6.3.2. Polymeric Nanocarriers and Nanostructured Systems for Osteoarthritis Treatment Preclinical evidence indicates that biodegradable polymer-based nanocarriers, such as PLGA and PEG-b-polyester micelles, have been engineered to enhance drug stability, prolong release, and improve cellular uptake. A widely cited 2019 study reported surfactant-modified polymeric nanoparticles prepared via a water/oil/water double-emulsion method, which yielded small, stable particles capable of sustained release and preserved bioactivity [ 157 158 Polymeric carriers enhance stability and controlled intra-articular release, but scale-up under GMP and long-term joint safety remain key gaps; priority: manufacturability at scale, degradation/by-product profiling, and standardized long-term safety. 6.3.3. Hybrid and Nanocomposite Strategies Evidence tier: Preclinical. Recent innovations target mesoporous and hybrid carriers combining multiple materials. A 2024 review on porous nanomaterials describes mesoporous silica as a versatile platform due to high loading capacity and surface functionalization options useful for OA therapies [ 159 160 6.3.4. Metal-Based Nanoparticles Evidence tier: Preclinical. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have demonstrated efficacy in modulating the gut–microbiota–joint axis, reducing osteoarthritis severity in preclinical ACLT models by shifting macrophage polarization to M2, increasing IL-10 and short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, and enhancing beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus, Akkermansia) [ 161 6.3.5. Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics Evidence tier: Early clinical. Growing clinical and mechanistic evidence links gut dysbiosis to the progression of OA. A 2025 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (n ≈ 694) demonstrated that oral probiotics significantly improved pain, joint function, and inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., hs-CRP) in patients with knee OA [ 162 Lactobacillus 163 164 Figure 3 A 2024 double-blind randomized clinical trial investigated the effects of a multistrain probiotic (Vivomixx ® 165 Latilactobacillus sakei 166 Mechanistic studies in animal models further support that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in bone and cartilage homeostasis. Dysbiosis has been linked not only to OA but also to other musculoskeletal conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. Dietary interventions using probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have shown promise in restoring microbial balance and preventing bone and cartilage degeneration, highlighting their relevance in chronic joint disorders [ 167 A recent review focusing on human orthopedic conditions concluded that modulating the gut microbiome with probiotics, prebiotics, and anti-inflammatory foods can reduce the need for NSAIDs and opioid medications [ 168 169 6.3.6. Translational Considerations (Regulation, CMC/GMP, Safety, Cost) Despite robust preclinical evidence and diverse nanoparticle systems under development, no nanomedicine has yet gained approval for OA therapy [ 170 150 171 172 152 Figure 4 Beyond proof-of-concept efficacy, nano-enabled platforms must demonstrate batch reproducibility, stability, and impurity control (CMC/GMP); provide comprehensive characterization and biodistribution; and demonstrate immunocompatibility and long-term joint safety. Scalability and cost-of-goods are critical for chronic OA care. Early regulatory dialogue and harmonized in vivo safety packages (e.g., complement activation and hemocompatibility) increase the probability of advancing to late-stage trials. Platforms that improve local exposure/retention with minimal off-target accumulation and can be manufactured reproducibly at scale are the most likely to progress. 7. Perspective and Research Priorities This review integrates the molecular rationale for polyphenols with the engineering levers of nanocarriers under a single translational lens. Beyond summarizing signals, we align mechanisms, exposure, and endpoints to clarify what is needed for clinical progress. Research priorities. We prioritize quantifying synovial-fluid and tissue pharmacokinetics in large-animal osteoarthritis models with phenolic payloads and adding imaging readouts for joint residency; aligning mechanisms to clinically meaningful endpoints by pairing pain and function with MRI measures of cartilage and bone-marrow lesions and by including soluble biomarkers that track NF-κB/Nrf2 activity; and standardizing dose and formulation reporting, including CMC attributes, release kinetics, and batch variability, to enable reproducible dosing across studies. Additional priorities are to assemble a harmonized safety package covering immunocompatibility, complement activation, hemocompatibility, repeat-dose joint safety, and off-target biodistribution; to conduct head-to-head platform comparisons using the same payload and dose to identify true delivery gains; and to assess scalability and cost by modeling cost-of-goods and manufacturability for chronic intra-articular use and by defining target product profiles. 8. Approach to Literature Selection A narrative literature review was conducted through a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO, and Google Scholar, covering publications up to July 2025. Keyword combinations such as “osteoarthritis,” “articular cartilage,” “chondrocytes,” “oxidative stress,” “inflammation,” “polyphenols,” “pinocembrin,” “CAPE,” “β-cyclodextrin,” “porous silicon,” “nanoparticles,” and “controlled release systems” were used, applying Boolean operators AND and OR to refine the results. The review included in vitro and in vivo studies addressing osteoarthritis pathophysiology, as well as those focused on therapeutic strategies based on natural compounds, nanomaterials, or drug delivery technologies. Studies on the synthesis and characterization of β-cyclodextrin-functionalized porous silicon nanoparticles were also considered. Exclusion criteria included duplicate records, studies without full-text access, publications in languages other than English or Spanish, and articles lacking relevant experimental evidence. In addition, structured databases such as PubChem were consulted for physicochemical data of the compounds studied, and digital tools such as BioRender were used to generate scientific illustrations. All included studies were critically evaluated based on methodological quality, recency, and scientific relevance. Evidence tiers. We classify evidence as Preclinical (in vitro or animal studies), Early clinical (pilot or early-phase trials), and Late clinical (adequately powered randomized or confirmatory trials). These labels are used throughout the manuscript to indicate the maturity of evidence. We labeled each subsection with the predominant evidence tier (Preclinical, Early clinical, Late-stage clinical) and added an ‘Evidence level’ column to Table 3 9. Critical Appraisal: Why Preclinical Signals Fade in Clinical Trials Although polyphenols and nano-enabled delivery consistently modulate inflammatory and oxidative pathways in chondrocytes and small-animal OA models, these signals rarely translate into robust clinical benefits. Three factors mainly drive this gap: exposure mismatches, effective in vitro concentrations often exceed intra-articular or systemic levels achievable with safe dosing; model limitations, surgical or cytokine-driven models privilege short-term surrogates and do not capture structural progression or patient-relevant function; and endpoint mismatch, biochemical readouts (e.g., MMPs, GAG release) map poorly onto pain, function, and imaging progression used in trials. Closing this gap requires exposure-matched designs, standardized models with structural/functional outcomes, and mechanism-aligned clinical endpoints. Whenever possible, preclinical studies should report dose–exposure relationships, joint retention, and batch/formulation variability to better inform trial design. 10. Conclusions OA remains a multifactorial and progressive joint disorder with no approved disease-modifying therapies to date. This review highlights the therapeutic promise of natural compounds, particularly polyphenols derived from propolis, such as pinocembrin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester, which exhibit significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and chondroprotective properties. These bioactive agents modulate key molecular pathways implicated in OA progression, including NF-κB, and oxidative stress mediators. Nanotechnology has emerged as a powerful platform to overcome limitations associated with poor solubility, chemical instability, and short intra-articular retention of natural compounds. Advanced delivery systems such as liposomes, polymeric micelles, hybrid nanoparticles, and cyclodextrin-functionalized nanocarriers have demonstrated enhanced tissue targeting, sustained release, and improved therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models. In addition, metallic nanocarriers and biomimetic coatings are being explored as innovative approaches to optimize pharmacological delivery in OA. Concurrently, growing evidence supports the gut–joint axis as a therapeutic target. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have shown potential to restore gut microbiota balance, reduce systemic inflammation, and improve clinical symptoms in OA patients. These strategies offer a complementary avenue that may enhance therapeutic efficacy through immunometabolic modulation. Taken together, current advances underscore a paradigm shift from conventional symptomatic management toward multi-targeted therapeutic strategies that integrate natural compounds, microbiota modulation, and nanotechnology-based drug delivery. Further clinical studies are essential to validate their long-term safety, efficacy, and translational applicability in the context of OA.

Mater. 2023 12 2301010 10.1002/adhm.202301010 37421185 Figure 1 Mechanisms Involved in the Progression of OA: This diagram illustrates the progression of OA driven by multiple risk factors such as aging, obesity, joint injury, biomechanical stress, and genetic predisposition. These stimuli trigger inflammatory responses mediated by cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α, leading to activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. As a result, there is increased expression of catabolic enzymes such as MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5, along with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and chondrocyte apoptosis. These molecular alterations contribute to ECM degradation, characterized by reduced collagen type II and aggrecan, which ultimately results in cartilage damage, synovial inflammation, and subchondral bone remodeling Created in BioRender. Vélez-Slimani, H. (2025). https://BioRender.com/qmqzp3l Figure 2 Current therapeutic strategies for OA. OA management involves pharmacological treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics, surgical interventions including joint replacement in advanced cases, and non-pharmacological measures such as weight loss, physical exercise, and lifestyle modifications. While these approaches alleviate symptoms and improve joint function, they do not halt the structural progression of cartilage degeneration. Consequently, emerging therapies based on biomaterials, bioactive compounds, and nanotechnology aim to modulate the joint microenvironment and promote tissue repair (Created in Microsoft PowerPoint).
