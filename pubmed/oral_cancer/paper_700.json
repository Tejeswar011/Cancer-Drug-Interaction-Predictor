Studies reported that the gut microbiota alteration in MSM were associated with HIV infection (Armstrong et al. 2018 2024 2018 Prevotella 2017 2016 2020 Prevotella Prevotellaceae Prevotella Prevotella 2016 Prevotella Prevotella Prevotella copri 2013 Prevotellaceae 2016 2021 2016 2024 Now existing studies have mainly focused on the observational gut microbiota dysbiosis in MSM with multiple factors including obesity (Cook et al. 2020 2020 2018 Prevotella 2018 2020 2010 Prevotellaceae 2016 2017 In this study, we aim to identify specific sexual behaviors influencing the abundance of Prevotellaceae Prevotellaceae Materials and methods Study participants MSM were enrolled from Chongqing City, with sexual behaviors and biological sample collected and approved on conducted between October and November 2023. The study protocol was reviewed by the ethics review board of Chongqing Medical University (Granted number: 2023045). All participants provided written informed consent for this study. Sexual behaviors were self-reported by participants. The inclusion criteria for participants were as follows: (1) MSM aged 18–65 years old. (2) Not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). (3) With a frequency of anal intercourse averaging once or more every two weeks in the past six months. (4) Without a history of major digestive system diseases, such as esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, etc. (5) Without a history of digestive system surgery. (6) Having not used any antibiotics in the past three months. (7) Not being a vegetarian. All participants provided written informed consent. Blood and fecal samples collection Blood and fecal samples were collected from all study participants. Fecal samples were immediately stored in DNA-preserving fecal collection tubes at room temperature to minimize DNA degradation. Within 24 h of collection, fecal samples were transferred to the laboratory and stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Blood samples were collected in EDTA-anticoagulated tubes, centrifuged within 24 h at the clinical laboratory, and the supernatant was subjected to ELISA for detection of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections. Fecal DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing Fecal DNA was extracted as follows. A 200 mg fecal sample was placed in a centrifuge tube with grinding beads, and 1 mL of ATL/PVP-10 buffer was added. The sample was homogenized using an Automatic Sample Rapid Grinder (JXFSTPRP-48, Shanghai Jingxin, China) and incubated at 65 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 0.6 µL of PCI buffer, vortexed for 15 s, and centrifuged at 18,213 g for 10 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a deep-well plate containing 600 µL magnetic bead binding solution, 20 µL proteinase K, 5 µL RNase, and 100 µL elution buffer. DNA extraction was performed using the MagPure Stool DNA KF Kit B (MD5115-02B, MAGEN, China) with the KingFisher system. Extracted DNA was transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified by PCR using primers 338F-806R (FWD: ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG; REV: GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT). Amplicons were quantified, normalized, and pooled for sequencing on the DNBSEQ G400 PE300 platform. Raw sequence data were filtered to remove low-quality reads and adapter-contaminated sequences. Tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity using USEARCH (v7.0.1090). OTU representative sequences were taxonomically annotated by aligning with the RDP database (Release 11.5) using the RDP classifier (v2.2). Statistical analysis in gut microbiota Alpha and beta diversities were evaluated based on the OTU count table using the vegan R package (v2.6–6.1). Five alpha indices were calculated, including (Observed OTUs, ACE, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices). Differences in all indices were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Kruskal–Wallis test. Beta diversity was visualized using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix, and statistical significance of group differences was assessed using the ANOSIM test. Additionally, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was employed to detect microbial features that were statistically different among sexual behaviors. Effect sizes were expressed as log-transformed LDA scores, and features with log LDA scores greater than 2.0 were considered significantly discriminative. Statistical significance was defined as P To compare Prevotellaceae Prevotellaceae Prevotellaceae Statistical analysis in Mendelian randomization (MR) Two-sample MR analysis was performed to verify causal associations between sexual behavior and gut microbiota. Given that high-risk sexual behavior frequently predisposes individuals to HIV acquisition, we further conducted a two-step MR analysis to evaluate the mediating effect of gut microbiota on the relationship between sexual behavior and HIV infection. GWAS data for sexual behaviors were obtained from the IEU Open GWAS project( https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/ https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ 2021 2022 The MR analysis utilized single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs) under three core assumptions:(1) IVs are unrelated to confounders, (2) IVs are strongly associated with exposures, and (3) IVs influence outcomes solely via exposures. IVs for each exposure trait were selected with a relaxed P 5 2 2024 P 2018 2021 2021 P All MR analyses were performed in R (v4.2.3) using the “Mendelian Randomization”, “TwoSampleMR”, and “MRPRESSO” packages. We used a uniform P 1 Fig. 1 The flow chart of this study Results Behavioral and demographic characteristics After excluding 5 participants due to ineligible fecal DNA detection results, 95 samples were included in the final analysis of gut microbiota. All participants completed a sexual behavior questionnaire, which included the following items assessed within the past six months: sexual roles (e.g., insertive/receptive), number of male partners, condom use, history of exposure to HIV-positive partners, engagement in commercial sex, diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), illicit drug use, and participation in group sex activities (Table 1 Table 1 Demographic and sexual behavior characteristics of MSM participants (N = 95) Variables N (95) 100.00% Age ≤ 45 years 90 94.74% > 45 years 5 5.26% BMI < 18.5 1 1.05% 18.5–22.9 41 43.16% 23.0–27.5 36 37.89% ≥ 27.5 17 17.89% Residence City 92 96.84% Village 3 3.16% Nationality Majority 91 95.79% Minority 4 4.21% Sexual role Insertive 33 34.74% Receptive 62 65.26% Number of male partner 0 ~ 1 35 36.84% 2 ~ 5 44 46.32% 6 ~ 9 3 3.16% ≥ 10 13 13.68% Condom use Yes 89 93.68% No 6 6.32% Exposure to HIV partner No 85 89.47% Yes 10 10.53% Commercial sex with man No 89 93.68% Yes 6 6.32% Diagnosis of STDs No 88 92.63% Yes 7 7.37% Illicit drug use No 88 92.63% Yes 7 7.37% Group sex activity No 87 91.58% Yes 8 8.42% BMI classification based on WHO recommendations (“Appropriate body-mass index for Asian populations and its implications for policy and intervention strategies” 2004 Sexual behavior associated with alterations in the global gut microbiota of MSM Firstly, we evaluated global gut microbiota diversity in HIV-negative MSM stratified by sexual behavior and identified key taxa via LEfSe. Specifically, we estimated five alpha diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson, Observed OTUs, Chao1, ACE; Table S2).

The results showed that most sexual behavior-related traits, except for the number of sexual partners, did not exhibit significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy (Figs. 5 P Fig. 5 The MR details and sensitivity test between sexual behavior and gut microbiota abundance.
