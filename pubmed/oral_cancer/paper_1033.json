Meanwhile, selenium (Se) is an antioxidant trace element with essential physiological roles in humans. The preterm neonate is the most heavily transfused patient. The multiple blood transfusions could expose this vulnerable group to trace elements with variable effects. This study aimed to quantify As and Se in various blood products that were used in neonatal blood transfusions alongside an estimate of a dose per transfusion. In addition to exposure quantification, database mining and molecular docking analysis were performed to explore potential detoxification strategies.

Introduction Very low birth weight (VLBW) and critically ill neonates are categories of patients with more frequently administered transfusion therapy [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 12 15 Arsenic is an environmental contaminant with different forms. Arsenite (As III V 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 III V 24 Selenium is an essential micronutrient for humans that is mainly obtained through diet and/or nutritional supplementation [ 25 26 27 25 28 29 30 31 28 29 The exposure of TEs from donor blood has been the subject of many scientific investigations focused on specific elements, such as lead, mercury, and Cd. This exposure is exceptionally high in vulnerable groups such as neonates, preterm infants, pregnant women, and others requiring multiple blood transfusions [ 10 11 32 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Sample Collection The blood product samples came from leftover units of various blood products transfused into neonates. A total of 120 samples were obtained, with 30 samples of each type of blood product (plasma, platelets, pRBCs, and WB). Before analysis, the samples were placed in trace-mineral-free vacutainers (Becton Dickenson Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and kept at −20 °C. All precautions were taken to minimize the risk of contamination during sample collection, aliquoting, storage, and transport to exclude any possibility of contamination. The used blood units were prepared in the Suez Canal University Hospital blood bank by using the following method: The whole blood from the donor was collected in a triple-blood donation bag (cat# 811-5303, JMS, Hayward, CA 94541, USA) with an anticoagulant-preservative of citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA-1). The primary bag contains 70 mL of CPDA-1, while the donated whole blood was 450 mL (±10%). The WB unit was loaded in the blood component centrifuge’s swinging bucket apparatus (Sorvall™ RC 128 P+, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), ensuring the opposing unit was balanced. The first stage separates RBC from the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) using light spin at 4 °C. At the end of the centrifuge cycle, the unit was removed from the centrifuge and placed into a plasma expressor. A hemostat was applied to the third bag tube, so the plasma flowed into only one bag. The tube was sealed and detached to separate the PRP bag with an empty satellite bag from the RBC bag. The second stage is to separate the platelets from the plasma. The PRP bag was placed in a balanced load into the blood component centrifuge’s swinging bucket apparatus and spun at a hard-spin setting. Once the centrifuge cycle had stopped, the bag was removed and placed into the plasma expressor. The temporary closure was removed, allowing the plasma to drain into an empty satellite bag, and the hemostat was applied when the approximate target platelet concentrate volume, usually 45 to 70 mL, was achieved. The tubing sealer was used to seal and detach the platelet and plasma components [ 33 2.2. ICP-MS Analysis Plasma, platelet, and WB samples directly underwent sample dilution before the subsequent ICP-MS analysis, while pRBCs were previously digested by mixing 400 μL of pRBCs with 800 μL of pure nitric acid (RPE analytical grade 69.5%, Carlo Erba Reagents, Cornaredo, Italy) in 15 mL capped polypropylene conical tubes (Cellstar ® v v v v TM v v 34 The analysis was conducted on a THERMO ICAP TM Table 1 2.3. Quality Control The quality of elemental analysis was monitored daily by measuring concentrations of reference materials used as quality controls at the beginning, periodically during the analysis sequence, and at the end ClinChek ® 2.4. Estimation of Dose per Transfusion The dose per transfusion (the metal exposure from each transfusion) was calculated as follows: volume transfused (L) X metal concentration in blood unit (μg/L)/weight (kg) = μg/kg/day. 2.5. In Silico Analysis The workflow of the in silico analysis conducted in this study is summarized in the flowchart ( Figure 1 2.5.1. Protein–Protein Interaction and Functional Enrichment Analyses To explore potential functional interactions, a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database ( https://string-db.org https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ https://reactome.org/ https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ 2.5.2. Ligand Preparation and Molecular Docking To investigate molecular interactions at the receptor level, molecular docking studies were conducted using the crystal structure of Arsenite Methyltransferase (AS3MT) (PDB ID: 6CX6), obtained from the Protein Data Bank. The co-crystallized ligand, S-adenosylhomocysteine (ASH), was used as a reference to validate docking accuracy and compare binding affinities. The ligands selected for docking included Glutathione (GSH), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), Folic acid, Monomethylarsonous acid (MMA III) and Resveratrol). Ligand structures were retrieved from the PubChem database and energy-minimized. UCSF Chimera was used for receptor and ligand preparation, including removal of water molecules, addition of hydrogen atoms, and selection of the binding site based on the ASH ligand. Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2008 software was employed for docking simulations. The docking site was defined to encompass the ASH binding pocket to ensure a reliable comparison. 2.6. Statistical Analysis Windows operating system was used for data entry, and the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS version 22) was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics: Median, mean, and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for the detectable values of As and Se concentrations to determine their distributions in different blood products. The Kruskal–Wallis (KW) test was used to compare levels of tested elements in blood products that were not normally distributed. Significance was considered at p 3. Results 3.1. Quality Control The method used in this study met appropriate laboratory quality criteria, including quality control monitoring. The analytical results of certified materials of whole blood and serum are shown in Table 2 3.2. Metal Concentrations in Donor Blood Units Metal concentrations in blood units were analyzed for 120 samples of 4 blood products (30 samples per each type of blood product). Out of 120 samples, the 2 investigated elements were detected in all samples. The As level in various blood units, arranged in descending order, is as follows: pRBCs, WBs, followed by platelets and plasma in the final position ( Table 3 Table 3 3.3. Dose per Transfusion The transfusion volume was variable, ranging from 20 to 100 mL. The median doses of As and Se per transfusion of all blood product units were 0.015 and 1.4 µg/kg/day in neonates with an average weight of 1.2 kg. The median dose per transfusion and IQR dose per transfusion of different blood product units are shown in Table 4 3.4. Molecular Docking Analysis To better define the molecular context of As metabolism, we performed pathway and enrichment analyses of AS3MT and GSTO1 together with oxidative stress–related genes. Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 2 Figure 3 Table 5 As shown in Figure 4 4. Discussion The current work is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to examine As and Se in different blood products used in blood transfusion using ICP-MS. Arsenic was detected in all blood product units investigated in this study. According to the As profile Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the typical As values in non-exposed individuals are less than 1 μg/L [ 35 The two maximum As levels were observed with concentrations of 3.3 and 3 μg/L, respectively. This observation highlights the significance of careful donor selection and/or further toxicological screening for harmful TEs prior to newborn blood transfusion. According to prior studies, choosing young donors (less than 22–23 years old) for neonatal transfusions is a suggested approach to lower the possibility of negative health outcomes [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 The reviewed evidence demonstrates that supplementing storage media with antioxidants like uric acid, ascorbic acid, glutathione, and metabolites such as L-carnitine effectively counters the storage lesion by enhancing redox metabolism and reducing hemolysis [ 42 43 As a limitation, the present study did not measure the different As species as percentages of total As. Since it is well known that the As toxicity ultimately depends on its chemical forms. Therefore, As speciation is an important issue due to the vast differences in toxicity between species like inorganic arsenic (As III V 44 V III 45 46 47 48 The highest As content in the present study was in pRBCs in comparison to the other blood products with statistical significance. This could be due to the RBCs taking up As after absorption and entering the bloodstream [ 12 11 It was reported that early-life exposure to As is associated with deficits in intelligence and memory. These effects may occur at low concentrations of exposure, and some neurocognitive consequences may manifest only later in life [ 42 49 50 3 51 According to the current study, neonates should be given extreme caution while making transfusion-related decisions. This is in agreement with a previous study that contrasted the outcomes of school-age children who were managed using the restricted transfusion guideline [ 1 52 The results of the present study showed a wider Se range than that detected in the previous study (55–117.4 μg/L) [ 53 54 55 53 56 In the present study, 74% (89 donors) had Se levels below 100 μg/L. Previous studies stated that cases with Se below 100 μg/L is a level that has been associated with sub-optimal activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [ 56 57 58 According to a prior report, Se bulk in the body was in the tissue pool with fractional uptake of Se by RBC [ 59 60 61 Our molecular docking analysis revealed that key methyl donors—folic acid, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and glutathione (GSH)—bind stably to arsenite methyltransferase (AS3MT), interacting with conserved residues such as ASN173, ASP115, and CYS92. These interactions suggest potential modulation of AS3MT activity, a key enzyme in As biotransformation. The docking results support the hypothesis that these methyl donors and thiol-containing compounds share critical interaction sites with the co-crystallized ligand S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), notably ASN173 and ASP115, which are essential for enzymatic methylation of As. These findings align with previous studies demonstrating that folate and SAM supplementation enhance As methylation efficiency and reduce the accumulation of toxic intermediates like monomethylarsonous acid (MMA III) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA V), thereby lowering arsenic-induced genotoxicity and oxidative stress in exposed populations. Gamble et al. showed that folate supplementation significantly improved As methylation capacity and reduced blood As levels in adults exposed to contaminated water [ 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 5. Conclusions Collectively, these results highlight that neonates are exposed to As and Se via different blood product transfusions with high potential to increase As (as a toxic TE) and decrease Se (as a beneficial TE) after transfusion. This study highlights the need to select donors and screen blood units with optimal Se levels and low As for neonatal transfusions. The results indicate that methyl donors (e.g., SAM, folic acid) and antioxidants (e.g., glutathione, resveratrol) show favorable binding interactions with AS3MT, consistent with their known biochemical roles in As metabolism and redox balance. These findings are hypothesis-generating and provide a molecular basis for future experimental validation; however, direct clinical implications, such as supplementation strategies in neonates, cannot be concluded from this analysis alone. 6. Further Recommendations Future in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate the predicted interactions of AS3MT with methyl donors and antioxidants and to assess their impact on As metabolism and detoxification. Neonatal-specific investigations, including the measurement of As metabolites in relation to folate, glutathione, and Se status, would provide important translational insights. Ultimately, if confirmed experimentally and clinically, such findings may guide the development of strategies to mitigate As toxicity in vulnerable neonatal populations.
