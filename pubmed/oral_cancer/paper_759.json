Introduction Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed for the treatment of chronic gastritis, esophagitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [ 1 2 3 4 5 Furthermore, acid-related problems can be efficiently managed with pantoprazole. Pantoprazole is used as a monotherapy for treating esophagitis and maintaining gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) as part of a triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori 6 6 + + 7 + + 8 7 9 Pellets are small spherical particles ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter and are typically filled into capsules or compressed into tablets [ 10 11 12 13 Eudragit ® ® ® 14 15 16 17 Moreover, various methods can be utilized to manufacture the pellets, such as direct pelletizing, suspension layering, powder layering, pelletization by expulsion and spheronization, pressure/balling, circular agglomeration, cryopelletization, liquefy spheronization, globulation or drop arrangement, and fluid bed coating. Out of them, fluidized bed coating is an effective technique for formulating pellets/microcapsules because of its adaptability, suitability in industrial-scale production, and simple process [ 18 19 20 21 19 Additionally, dysphagia is the main problem for geriatric and pediatric patients in taking oral medication. It is defined as difficulty in swallowing [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Thus, pharmaceutical drug delivery scientists have designed orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs), a novel oral dosage form that dissolves quickly in saliva, typically within a few seconds to minutes, and eliminates the need for water to meet these medical needs. The fast-dissolving property of these dosage forms is attributed to the swift ingress of water into the tablet matrix, resulting in rapid disintegration in the mouth [ 30 31 In this study, enteric-coated multiparticulates were developed by employing different solution/suspension layering on a nonpareil core material in a bottom spray fluidized bed coater (Pam Glatt, India). In addition, to utilize the numerous benefits of unit dosage forms, such as cost effectiveness, ease of manufacturing, patient compliance, and various pharmaceutical industry applications, ODTs were formulated by employing directly compressible materials with different super-disintegrating agents. The enteric-coated pellets and ODT with pellets were evaluated for the various physicochemical and in vitro release studies. Hence, the study aimed to develop the innovative drug-containing pH-sensitive enteric-coated multiparticulates comprising ODT formulations that effectively protect the drug from the gastric acidic environment. This innovative product can benefit the dysphagia populations, regardless of the age of the population (pediatric or geriatric), in relieving flatulence problems or other gastric problems such as ulcers, gastritis, GORD, or esophagitis. 2. Materials and Methods Crosslinked PVP and PVP K-29/32 (ISP Technologies Inc., Wayne, NJ, USA), ethyl cellulose (BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, Dorset, UK), HPMC-E5 (Huzhou Hopetop, Pharmaceutical Co., Huzhou, China), HPMC-E50LV, HPMC-E4M, HPMC-K100LV, and HPMC-K4M (Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., Gurgaon, India), spray-dried lactose (Ind-Swift Ltd., Parwanoo, India), Pearlitol SD 160 (Roquette, Lestrem, France), Eudragit L100 (Acrycoat), and Eudragit L30 D-55 (Corel Pharma Chem, Ahmedabad, India) were generously gifted. Sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium (Loba Chemie, Mumbai, India) and PEG-6000 (S.D. Fine chemicals Ltd., Mumbai, India) were purchased. All other ingredients and reagents were of analytical grade. 2.1. Preparation of Multiparticulates The preparation of the multiparticulates is a four-step process. The procedure for coating is as follows: Step 1: Seal coat with ethyl cellulose onto nonpareil pellets (microcrystalline cellulose PH112); Step 2: Drug layering; Step 3: Sub-coat or protective layering with HPMC and; Step 4: Enteric coating with Eudragit L 100 (non-aqueous polymer) and Eudragit L30 D55 (aqueous suspension). All the steps were completed in the fluidized bed mini Glatt (Pam Glatt, Pune, India) coater using the bottom spraying technique, with a Wurster insert and a nozzle size of 0.3 mm. The coating solution was applied by using a peristaltic pump with a silicon pipe that had a hose size of 2.0 mm (internal diameter), and the quantity of applied coating was measured using a balance (Mettler, Mumbai, India). The product temperature and inlet temperature were monitored through a temperature sensor fitted within the fluidized bed instrument. 2.1.1. Seal Coating Seal coating was performed with a 4% w v Table 1 2.1.2. Drug Layering After passing #60, seal-coated pellets were placed into the fluidized bed coater, and drug layering was performed onto the seal-coated core material. The fresh drug solution (15% w v w v Table 1 pharmaceutics-17-01187-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Process parameters for developing multiparticulates.

Sub-Coating Using sub-coating polymers, as indicated in Table 2 w v Table 1 w w Table 2 2.1.4. Enteric Coating The next step was an enteric coating on the sub-coated pellets. Sub-coated pellets were screened through a #40 mesh to remove any lumps, then loaded into a fluidized bed coater, and processed according to the parameters listed in Table 1 w v w w Table 2 w w w v Table 1 Table 2 2.2. Characterization of Enteric-Coated Multiparticulates 2.2.1. Size Analysis The size analysis of all batches of the multiparticulate pellets was performed using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern, Worcestershire, Grovewood Road, UK), employing the dry dispersion technique at an air pressure of 0.22–0.40 bar and a feed rate of 29–42%. The mean diameter [D (0.5)] and span values were evaluated. The size distribution graphs were automatically generated. 2.2.2. Morphology and Shape Analysis A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to check the morphology of the optimized batch of pellets (JSM 6100, Tokyo, Japan). The pellets were coated with a thin gold/palladium layer and then examined at 5 kV at various magnification levels from 130× to 270×. Following this, the shape analysis was performed by using an Olympus CH-20i-Tr optical microscope (Olympus, Mumbai, India) with a projection system at 10× magnification. The diameters of 20 pellets were measured randomly from each batch and noted to calculate different shape parameters (elongation, rectang, and roundness), employing the following formulae: E l o n g a t i o n = M a x i m u m  r a d i u s M i n i m u m  r a d i u s R e c t a n g = A r e a 4 × M a x i m u m  r a d i u s × M i n i m u m  r a d i u s R o u n d n e s s = A r e a π × M a x i m u m  r a d i u s 2 2.2.3. Porosity and Density Porosity and densities of the multiparticulates were determined as per the reported method [ 32 Bulk density, tapped density, and porosity were calculated by applying the following formulas: B u l k  d e n s i t y ( δ ) = M V b T a p p e d  d e n s i t y ( δ ) = M V p %  P o r o i t y  ( ε )  = V b − V p V b × 100 Vb Vp M 2.2.4. Hausner Ratio and Carr’s Index Both parameters indicate the flow properties of a powder or granular material. Hausner ratio and Carr’s index were calculated using the following formulas [ 33 H a u s n e r  r a t i o = ρ t a p p e d ρ b u l k C a r r ′ s  i n d e x = 1 − ρ b u l k ρ t a p p e d ∗ 100 ρ ρ 2.2.5. Angle of Repose and Flow Rate The flow properties were measured in terms of angle of repose and flow rate. For the determination of the angle of repose, 25 g of pellets was allowed to flow freely through a funnel onto a smooth, vibration-free, and horizontal surface from a height of 3 cm. The diameter and height of the heap were measured, and the angle of repose was calculated using the following formula: θ = t a n − 1 h r θ The flow rate was calculated as the time taken for 10 g of pellets to flow through a funnel. The determinations for the angle of repose and flow rate were performed in triplicate, and the results are presented as the mean with standard deviation of each batch. 2.2.6. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) DSC analysis was carried out Thermal Analysis Q20 differential scanning calorimeter to examine the physical state of the drug in the pellet formulations. The pure drug and pellets of the optimized batch were placed in separate aluminum pans and sealed. Then they were placed and heated at 5 °C/min in the range of 10–300 °C, using an empty sealed pan as a reference and dry nitrogen as the purge gas. 2.2.7. Drug Content An accurately weighed amount of the multiparticulates of each batch equivalent to 22.6 mg of drug was dispersed in 100 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) in a 100 mL volumetric flask. Further, they were sonicated in a bath sonicator until the multiparticulates completely dissolved. Afterwards, the aliquot sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was collected, filtered, subsequently diluted, and the drug content was determined spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 290 nm (UV-vis spectrophotometer, Genesys, Waltham, MA, USA). The drug content of each batch was determined in triplicate. 2.2.8. In Vitro Drug Release from Multiparticulates The in vitro release profile of the multiparticulates pellets was determined in hexaplicate using a USP type II apparatus containing 750 mL of 0.1 N HCl maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C for 2 h and then further in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (with 250 mL addition of 0.2 M trisodium phosphate in 750 mL of 0.1 N HCl). The stirring speed was kept at 100 rpm. Samples were withdrawn at various time intervals over 12 h and replaced with the same release medium. The samples were analyzed by using a UV spectrophotometer at 290 nm to calculate the drug release. The graph was plotted as mean and standard deviation. 2.2.9. Drug Release Kinetics of Multiparticulates To study the mechanism of drug release from the prepared multiparticulates, the release kinetics data were evaluated by using zero-order (Equation (1)), first-order (Equation (2)), Higuchi’s square root of time equation (Equation (3)), Korsemeyer and Peppas Equation (Equation (4)), and Hixson–Crowell’s cube root of time equation (Equation (5)) [ 34 2 M t 0 0 (1) t 0 0 logM t 0 t (2) t 0 t M t h (3) t h M t ∞ n (4) Here, M t ∞ Hixson–Crowell’s cube root of time equation is as follows: M 0 1/3 t 1/3 s (5) 0 t s 2.3. Preparation of Orally Disintegrating Tablets (ODTs) The compositions of ODTs are presented in Table 3 Table 3 Briefly, mannitol DC (Pearlitol SD 160, MTL DC), microcrystalline cellulose PH102 (MCC PH102, Avicel PH102), and the multiparticulates of each batch were previously passed through #40. The quantities of ingredients were weighed as shown in Table 3 ®, ® ® Table 3 2.4. Evaluation of ODTs 2.4.1. Weight Variation Twenty tablets were selected randomly from each formulation and weighed individually using a weighing balance (Mettler, Mumbai, India). The individual weights were compared with the average weight to calculate the variation in the weight of tablets. 2.4.2. Diameter and Thickness All the tablet batches were evaluated for diameter and thickness by using Vernier calipers. The diameter and thickness of the six tablets from each batch were measured, and the average value reported. 2.4.3. Hardness and Friability The hardness of the six tablets from each batch was measured using the Monsanto Hardness Tester (Campbell Electronics, Mumbai, India). The friability of the tablets was measured using a USP-type Roche friabilator in triplicate (Tropical Lab Equipment, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India). Pre-weighed tablets (≥6.5 g) were placed in the plastic drum of the friabilator instrument. A 100 revolution was rotated at a speed of 25 rpm for 4 min. The tablets were then de-dusted, reweighed, and the percentage weight loss (friability) was calculated as follows: % F r i a b i l i t y = I n i t i a l  w e i g h t − f i n a l  w e i g h t I n i t i a l  w e i g h t ∗ 100 2.4.4. Drug Content Uniformity For the content uniformity test, 20 tablets were weighed and pulverized to a fine powder. A quantity of powder equivalent to 22.6 mg of drug was extracted into phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The supernatant was collected and subsequently diluted. The drug content was determined by measuring the absorbance at 290 nm after appropriate dilution with the same medium. The drug content was determined using a regression equation. The mean percent drug content was calculated as an average of three determinations. 2.4.5. Wetting Time A conventional method was utilized to measure the wetting time of the ODT as reported previously [ 35 2.4.6. In Vitro Drug Release from ODT The in vitro release profile of the tablets was determined by using a USP type II apparatus at 37 ± 0.5 °C and 100 rpm in 750 mL of 0.1 N HCl for 2 h, then in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (with the addition of 250 mL of 0.2 M tri-sodium phosphate in 750 mL 0.1 N HCl). Samples were withdrawn at various time intervals over 12 h and replaced with the same thermoregulated release medium. The samples were analyzed at 290 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer, and the drug release was calculated. The release study was performed in hexaplicate. The graph was plotted as mean and standard deviation. 2.4.7. Drug Release Kinetics of ODT The drug release kinetics of ODTs were determined similarly as mentioned in Section 2.2.9 3. Results 3.1. Multiparticulates Size Distribution Analysis The size distribution of the multiparticulates should be as narrow as possible, as it ensures a minimum variation in coating thickness and coating performance within the batch. If the multiparticulates are intended for compression, a wide size distribution may lead to segregation and variations in content uniformity. Mean particle size and span values for prepared batches of multiparticulates are depicted in Table 4 The graphs of particle size distribution of the drug, core material (nonpareil), and optimized batches are shown in Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 The mean diameter of all the prepared pellet batches (Batch 1 to 7b) of multiparticulates varied from 197.671 to 529.511 µm with span values of 0.603 to 0.838 ( Table 4 Table 4 3.2. Morphology and Shape Analysis of Multiparticulates Pellets The morphology and shape analysis of the multiparticulates pellets was performed by optical microscopy images and scanning electron microscopy analysis ( Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Table 5 For all the prepared pellet batches, the roundness factor ranged from 0.781 to 0.917, indicating that all the pellets formed were almost circular ( Table 5 w w w w w w w w Table 2 Table 5 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 3.3. Flow Properties Parameters Bulk density indicates the extent of densification or compactness of a substance. The bulk densities of all batches varied from 0.677 to 0.798 g/cm 3 3 Table 6 Among the prepared pellet batches, the lowest bulk density was obtained for Batch 3 (0.677 g/cm 3 3 3 In addition, the Hausner ratio for all pellet batches ranges from 1.017 to 1.141, and Carr’s index for various batches ranges from 5.582 to 13.362 ( Table 6 Table 7 3.4. Angle of Repose and Flow Rate The results of the angle of repose and flow rate for all multiparticulate batches are listed in Table 8 Table 7 Even though all batches showed good flow properties, the best flow properties were found for optimized Batch 7b with an angle of repose of 18.29° and flow rate 4.16 g/s as shown in Table 8 3.5. Drug Content Uniformity The results of the drug content are presented in Table 8 3.6. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) The thermal analysis technique known as DSC unveils both physical and chemical alterations in a material by measuring the difference in heat flow between a sample and a reference as a function of temperature. DSC is commonly utilized in research, quality control, and product development in various fields, like polymers and pharmaceuticals. It can determine thermal properties, for instance, melting points, crystallization behavior, glass transitions, and chemical reactions by observing heat absorption or release [ 36 DSC thermogram peaks at 65.29 °C (enthalpy 23.31 J/g) and 80.65 °C, indicating glass transitions (Tg) or recrystallization events of the drug ( Figure 7 Figure 7 DSC thermogram peaks at 49.84 °C (enthalpy 35.58 J/g), with potentially 79.54 °C representing cold crystallization transitions, while at 160.12 °C (enthalpy 26.31 J/g) and 204.59 °C broader peaks were observed and suggest the amorphous or semi-crystalline behavior of the drug ( Figure 7 3.7. In Vitro Dissolution Studies of Multiparticulates To determine the impact of distinct excipients in varying ratios, coating compositions, and coat thicknesses on the drug’s release from the produced formulations, dissolution experiments are conducted. Hence, the type and coating level (%) of the enteric coating polymer as well as the multiparticulate pellets’ acid resistance when coated with aqueous and non-aqueous enteric coating polymers were identified. The dissolution profiles of enteric-coated pellets are depicted in Figure 8 Batch 1, Batch 2, and Batch 3 exhibited drug release of 42.376%, 33.601%, and 27.085% in acidic medium (0.1 N HCl, pH 1.2) for 2 h, respectively ( Figure 8 Hence, Batch 4a, Batch 4b, and Batch 5a were prepared, and in vitro drug release was shown to be lower than previous batches, i.e., 23.634%, 12.371%, and 10.941% in acidic medium for 2 h, respectively ( Figure 8 w w Table 2 Figure 8 As the drug release in acidic medium was observed to be higher than the official compendia limit (<10%), further modification in coating level and polymer selection was performed in subsequent batches. Subsequently, the multiparticulates Batch 5b, Batch 6, Batch 7a, and Batch 7b were prepared, which showed drug release of 9.648%, 9.412%, 6.877%, and 6.136% in acidic medium at 2 h, respectively ( Figure 8 3.8. Kinetic Model for Drug Release from Various Multiparticulates Pellet Batches The multiparticulates pellets Batch 1, Batch 2, Batch 3, and Batch 4a followed the Korsmeyer–Peppas release model, while Batch 4b, Batch 5a, Batch 5b, Batch 6, Batch 7a, and Batch 7b observed first-order release kinetics. Batch 4b, Batch 5a, Batch 5b, Batch 6, Batch 7a, and Batch 7b confirmed the concentration-dependent drug release ( Table 9 3.9. Evaluation of ODTs 3.9.1. Content Uniformity Content uniformity in the prepared batches of ODTs with microparticulate pellets was found to be between 98.36 ± 1.75–99.81 ± 1.01%, as shown in Table 10 3.9.2. Weight Variation All the prepared ODT formulations showed the weight variation within limits as per the USP 39 requirements for weight variation, as shown in Table 10 3.9.3. Hardness and Friability Hardness values of the ODT formulations were found in the range of 2.216 ± 0.654–2.538 ± 0.743 kg/cm 2 Table 10 2 All the ODT formulations prepared with CL-PVP showed friability in the range of 0.712–1.296% ( Table 10 Friability for ODTs prepared from CCS and SSG as disaggregating agents was found in the range of 0.692–1.268% and 0.680–1.270%, respectively ( Table 10 3.9.4. Wetting Time According to the compendia standards, ODT should disintegrate within 3 min when examined via the test for the disintegration of tablets and capsules [ 37 Table 10 Furthermore, it was observed that the main factor influencing the wetting time of ODTs prepared with CL-PVP was the compression force rather than the disintegrant concentration, while, when SSG was used as a disintegrant, regardless of the compression force, the disintegration/wetting time was only dependent on the concentration of the disintegrant [ 38 3.9.5. In Vitro Dissolution Studies of ODTs The comparative release profiles of ODTs with selected multiparticulates pellets are shown in Figure 9 3.9.6. Kinetic Model for Drug Release Mechanism from ODT Formulations Kinetic modeling of the release profile for various ODT formulations was performed to determine the underlying release mechanisms. The correlation coefficient values for various models are listed in Table 11 Table 11 As expected from first-order release kinetics, the rate of drug release will progressively decrease over time, as the reservoir of drug in the device decreases [ 39 4. Discussion An enteric-coated multiparticulate system for the drug was developed by employing an inert core material using a bottom spray fluidized coater. Four steps were followed, for instance, a seal coat of ethyl cellulose on core material, drug layering on seal-coated core particles, and sub-coating on drug-layered core with different grades of hydrophilic polymer. Finally, an enteric coat was applied on sub-coated particles with pH-dependent polymer (Eudragit L100 or Eudragit L30 D-55). The pH-responsive polymers have ionizable acidic or basic residues whose ionization depends on the solution pH of the medium [ 40 41 The enteric coat polymer resists the drug release in the stomach, i.e., prevents the release of the drug in the acidic medium, whereas it releases the drug into the intestine. Enteric-coated drug pellets follow a sustained release profile and improve clinical efficacy, patient compliance, and reduce the associated side effects. Furthermore, a multiparticulates system can deliver the incompatible agents simultaneously, homogeneous distribution throughout the GIT, augmented absorption of the drug, minimal local irritation, reduced risk of dose dumping, attainment of stable drug plasma levels, and reduce the inter- and intra-patient variability [ 42 In this experiment, the enteric coating material is weakly acidic, while the pantoprazole sodium-loaded pellets are weakly basic; therefore, a sub-coating layer was added between them to improve the stability and acid resistance of the enteric-coated pellets. Hence, the pellets loaded with pantoprazole sodium were coated with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as a separating layer. In addition, the glass transition temperature of Eudragit ® ® 43 w w 7 w w The particle size analysis showed a narrow size distribution, as it is evident from the low span values, and a single slender peak for the optimized batches of pellets ( Table 4 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 44 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 45 Table 5 Figure 6 46 The variation in density of pellets from batch to batch affects the potency of finished products, produces segregation during mixing, and causes problems in batch size determination during coating. The bulk and tapped densities of various batches of pellets, along with the Hausner ratios, Carr’s index, and porosity, are represented in Table 6 3 Table 6 47 48 49 50 51 52 The Hausner ratio and Carr’s index are measures of interparticle friction and have been widely used to estimate the flow properties. A Hausner ratio value of less than 1.20 indicates good flowability of the material, whereas a value of 1.5 or higher suggests poor flow of the material [ 53 Table 6 Table 7 Table 8 The drug content was observed above 97% in all the developed multiparticulates ( Table 8 DSC analysis of the drug was performed to determine its thermal properties and the interactions with the excipients used in the multiparticulates formulations. The DSC results of optimized Batch 7b suggested that the drug-loaded multiparticulates pellets are composed of a homogeneous phase in which the polymer shows a higher degree of crystallinity than the drug. The results indicated that the drug may be molecularly dispersed in the sub-coating polymer ( Figure 7 Dissolution testing is intended to provide a step toward evaluating the physiological availability of the drug. For commercial products, dissolution testing is used primarily to confirm manufacturing and product consistency and to assess post-approval changes and the need for bioequivalence studies [ 54 55 Figure 8 Table 2 Figure 8 Figure 8 56 Figure 8 In addition, kinetic modeling of the release profile for all batches was performed to determine the underlying release mechanisms. The correlation coefficient values for various models are listed in Table 9 Table 9 57 Out of all multiparticulates batches, Batch 5a, Batch 5b, Batch 6, Batch 7a, and Batch 7b confirmed the drug release in acidic medium at close to or less than 10% at 2 h ( Figure 8 ODT should disintegrate rapidly in the mouth and possess enough structural integrity to withstand handling without substantial breakage. Thus, tablet properties such as hardness and friability are closely linked to causing rapid tablet disintegration. According to the European Pharmacopoeia IV (EP IV), all the formulations developed can be defined as ‘‘fast dispersible” if they de-aggregate within 3 min. The drug content in the compressed ODTs was found to be >98%, which indicates the uniform distribution of the multiparticulates in the ODTs ( Table 10 Table 10 http://www.uspbpep.com/usp29/v29240/usp29nf24s0_c2091.html 2 Table 10 2 58 In addition, tablet friability is a measurement of the tablet’s physical strength. As shown in Table 10 59 60 Table 10 The wetting time of the tablets can be replaced with the disintegration time measurement. This experiment mimics the action of saliva in contact with the tablet [ 61 62 63 w w w w Table 10 Hence, ODTs prepared with CL-PVP ( Table 3 Figure 9 Figure 9 2 5. Conclusions We successfully developed enteric-coated multiparticulates containing pantoprazole sodium and formulated them into orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs). The physicochemical properties of both multiparticulates and ODTs were systematically evaluated. The multiparticulates, coated with HPMC E5 and Eudragit ® ® Therefore, it can be concluded that the ODT containing the developed multiparticulates represents a promising drug delivery system, offering several advantages including ease of administration, taste masking, sustained release, and enhanced bioavailability. The successful development and commercialization of this formulation requires careful consideration of formulation parameters, manufacturing processes, and quality control measures. Moreover, this type of dosage form may be particularly suitable for elderly and pediatric patients who have difficulty swallowing conventional solid oral formulations.
