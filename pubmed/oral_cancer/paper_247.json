Histone methyltransferase SET and MYND Domain Containing 3 (Smyd3) is strongly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, however, its role in adaptive thermogenesis has not been well characterized. Here, we demonstrate that Smyd3 is abundant and closely involved in adipocyte thermogenic programming. However, genetic ablation of Smyd3 or pharmacological inhibition with the specific inhibitor EPZ031686 robustly enhanced adaptive thermogenesis in mice. Conversely, Smyd3 overexpression attenuated white adipose tissue (WAT) browning both in vivo and in vitro.

Differences of means were analyzed by using one-way or two-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni’s post hoc t p Results Smyd3 is abundant and closely involved in adipocyte thermogenic programming Firstly, to delineate the spatial distribution and functional enrichment of Smyd3 in human adipose, we conducted systematic analysis of a published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset derived from a comprehensive human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) transcriptomic atlas ( https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell 24 S1 https://www.proteinatlas.org/ SMYD3 SMYD3 S1 S1 E 1 1  Fig. 1 Smyd3 is abundant and closely involved in adipocyte thermogenic programming. A n B Smyd3 n C n D E A p B, D Subsequently, we established a β3-adrenoceptor agonist (CL316,243)-induced adipose thermogenic mouse model and found the protein expressions of UCP1 were increased in CL316,243-stimulated eWAT, iWAT, and BAT, suggesting the in vivo thermogenesis model was established successfully. Meanwhile, we observed that Smyd3 protein expressions in BAT, iWAT, and eWAT were also significantly upregulated upon CL316,243 stimulation (Fig. 1 1 S2 To evaluate the role of Smyd3 in adipocyte thermogenic programming, we established an in vitro differentiation system using primary stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells isolated from BAT (BAT-SVF). We found that the protein expression of Smyd3 increased progressively during BAT-SVF adipogenic commitment and maturation, reaching peak expression levels at terminal differentiation phases (days 6–8), which showed the similar pattern with the expression profile of UCP1 (Fig. 1 S3 1 S3 Smyd3 Ppargc1α S3 Genetic ablation of Smyd3 triggers WAT browning and adaptive thermogenesis program in vivo To study the function of Smyd3 in adipose tissues, we employed the Smyd3 global knockout ( Smyd3 22 2 Ucp1 Ppargc1α iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (Dio2) T-box transcription factor 1 (Tbx1) Smyd3 Ppargc1α Tbx1 Smyd3 2 Ucp1 Ppargc1α and Dio2 Smyd3 2  Fig. 2 Genetic ablation of Smyd3 triggers WAT browning and adaptive thermogenesis program in vivo.

Preliminary knockdown efficiency was confirmed through immunoblot quantification and we found that siRNA#1 was more effective and selected for the subsequent functional validation (Fig. 5 5 Smyd3 Smyd3 5 Dio2 Cidea Ppargc1a 5  Fig. 5 Knockdown of Smyd3 enhanced the beige or brown adipocyte thermogenesis.

Among these, Smyd3-dependent H4K20me3 enrichment exhibits transcriptional repression properties. Importantly, emerging evidence demonstrates that H4K20 methylation status is indispensable for both the maintenance and activation of adipocyte thermogenic program [ 15 27 7 Pparg Smyd3 7 Smyd3 7 Smyd3 7 7 Smyd3 Smyd3 7 S5 Pparg Smyd3 7 Pparg Pparg 7 Pparg Smyd3 Pparg Pparg Ucp1  Fig. 7 Loss of Smyd3 triggers WAT browning and adaptive thermogenesis via enhancing PPARγ expression in a H4K20me3-dependent manner.

In this study, we identified histone methyltransferase Smyd3 restrains WAT browning and adaptive thermogenesis by inhibiting PPARγ expression in a H4K20me3-dependent manner. Deletion or inhibition of Smyd3 triggers the thermogenic program, which may be a potential target for therapeutics of obesity and the related disorders. A notable discrepancy exists between the expression profile of Smyd3 and its functional roles in thermogenic adipocyte regulation, presenting an intriguing paradox that warrants further investigation. Notably, Smyd3 showed enrichment in BAT and iWAT, with its expression being substantially upregulated following cold exposure (4 °C) and β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 stimulation. However, our in vitro and in vivo data show that Smyd3 exerts a suppressive effect on WAT browning or adaptive thermogenesis. That is, genetic knockout of Smyd3 by Smyd3 Smyd3 28 Smyd3 is reported to catalyze the trimethylation of H3K4, H4K5, and H4K20 [ 14 Cdkn1a Pcna 22 23 29 15 Smyd3 Smyd3 Pparg Pparg Pparg Ucp1 Current therapeutic strategies for obesity management emphasize enhancing systemic energy expenditure through activation of WAT browning programs or adaptive thermogenic pathways [ 30 22 23 26 31 Ucp1 An intriguing observation was the differential effect on UCP1 expression in classical BAT between the global Smyd3 Smyd3 Despite of our novel and significant findings, there are several limitations in this study. Firstly, considering the Smyd3 inhibitor EPZ031686 promotes WAT browning and adaptive thermogenesis, the anti-obesity effect of EPZ031686 should be tested in the high fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model. In addition, the adipocyte-specific Smyd3 Materials and methods The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Materials Reagent sources were as follows: the Smyd3 specific inhibitor EPZ031686 (MCE, HY-19324), β3-adrenoceptor agonist CL316,243 (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#C5976), dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#D4902), forskolin (FSK) (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#F6886), isoproterenol (ISO) (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#I5627), 3,30,5-Triiodo-L-thyronine sodium salt (T3) (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#T6397), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#I5879), rosiglitazone (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#R2408), insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, CAT#I2643). Antibodies were obtained from the following commercial sources: β-Tubulin (Proteintech, 66240-1-Ig), β-actin (Proteintech, 66009-1-Ig), Smyd3 (Abclonal, A14516), UCP1 (Proteintech, 23673-1-AP), H4K20me3 (Santa cruz biotechnology, sc-134216), histone H4 (Santa cruz biotechnology, sc-25260), HSP90 (Proteintech, 60004-1-lg), PPARγ (Proteintech, 16643-1-AP), PGC1α (Proteintech, 66369-1-Ig). Animal experiments All laboratory animal procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition 2011) issued by the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Fudan University. Mice were fed and watered AD libitum at room temperature 22–23 °C and humidity 40–60% under a 12-h light/dark cycle. Male mice were selected due to variables in female mice (uncertain hormonal changes, etc.). Mice were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg). Adipose tissue was then harvested for further examination. For the Smyd3 specific inhibitor EPZ031686 treatments, EPZ031686 (20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected daily for a week. Then mice were sacrificed and adipose tissues were obtained as described above. For the mice adaptive thermogenesis model, CL316,243 (0.5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected daily for a week. Before intraperitoneal injection of CL316,243, iWAT was in situ injected with lentivirus overexpressing Smyd3 ( Smyd3 The construction of Smyd3 knockout mice The Smyd3 knockout ( Smyd3 21 Smyd3 Smyd3 Plasmid construction, lentivirus generation, concentration and infection The cDNA plasmid of Smyd3 was constructed using the pcDNA3.1 vector. Briefly, the coding sequence (CDS) fragment of Smyd3 (GenBank: NM_027188.4 To produce lentivirus, the recombinant plasmid was co-transfected with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G into HEK293T cells using Polyethylenimine (PEI, Polysciences, USA). The lentivirus supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection and filtered through 0.45-µm filters to harvest the lentivirus. The lentivirus was then concentrated using a lentivirus concentration kit (AC04L441, Life-iLab) for the following in vivo studies. Histological analysis of adipose tissues The BAT, iWAT, and eWAT samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Paraffin sections of 5 μm thickness were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Images shown in figures are representative results of at least four biological replicates. Adipocyte sizes were analyzed by ImageJ software. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) BAT, iWAT, and eWAT were fixed with fat fixation solution and sectioned into 5 μm paraffin sections. Subsequently, antigen retrieval was performed, and non-specific binding sites were blocked with 10% goat serum. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with secondary antibodies. Signal was detected using DAB staining, followed by hematoxylin counterstaining. The target protein expression was assessed via microscopic observation and image analysis. Positive cell counts for quantifying the target protein were performed using ImageJ software. Culture and differentiation of primary stroma-vascular fraction (SVF) cells The primary SVF cells derived from iWAT and BAT of male mice were isolated according to previously established protocols [ 32 2 Culture and browning induction of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes The 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin until reaching confluence. Subsequently, the 3T3-L1 cells were induced with induction medium containing DMEM, 10% FBS, 10 µg/ml insulin, 0.5 mM IBMX, 1 µM rosiglitazone, 1 µM T3, and 1 µM dexamethasone (day 0). Two days later, the cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 µM T3, 1 µM rosiglitazone, and 10 µg/ml insulin (day 2), and the same treatment was repeated on day 4. Following an additional two days, the cells were stimulated in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 µM CL316,243 and maintained in this medium until complete differentiation. The medium was changed every two days. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection The mouse Smyd3 siRNA (sense 5’- CGGGAAUGCAGUUGUCUUATT-3’, antisense 5’-UAAGACAACUGCAUUCCCGTT-3’) and control siRNA (5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3’) were procured from GenePharma (Shanghai, China) and transfected into either 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or iWAT-SVF cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Following transfection for 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-containing medium, and the cells were then induced for differentiation. Western blotting After being lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (Servicebio, China) containing protease inhibitors to mitigate protein degradation, the harvested adipose tissues or cells were subjected to examine the protein concentration using a BCA assay kit (Share-bio). Subsequently, the protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (NC) membranes. Following a 1.5 h blocking step at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The next day, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied, after which the experimental results were detected using ChemiDoc + Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis Total RNA was extracted from adipose tissues or cells using TRIzol Reagent (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China). Subsequently, 2 µg of RNA underwent DNA digestion and reverse transcription using a PrimeScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of the target mRNA levels was conducted using the iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with SYBR Green, and the expression was normalized to β-actin. The primer sequences are provided in Table S1 ChIP-PCR ChIP-PCR was performed to investigate H4K20me3 enrichment at the promoter of Pparg 7 2 2 For immunoprecipitation, 3 µg of anti-H4K20me3 antibody (sc-134216, Santa Cruz) was diluted in BSA-PBS and incubated with Protein G magnetic beads (#161–4023, Bio-RAD) overnight at 4 °C. Fragmented chromatin was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed sequentially with low-salt, high-salt, LiCl, and TE buffers. Chromatin-protein complexes were eluted with ChIP elution buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) at 65 °C for 30 min, followed by reverse crosslinking overnight. DNA was purified using a column-based kit (Servicebio). PCR amplification was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Yeasen) with the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, followed by 30–40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52–58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with EB, and visualized under UV light. DNA enrichment was normalized to input DNA, and experiments were performed in technical triplicates. The primer sequences are provided in Table S2 Correlation analysis of single-cell transcriptomics For correlation analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data, low-quality cells (mitochondrial gene content > 10% or gene count outside 200–6000) and low-abundance genes (expressed in < 3 cells) was firstly filtered using Seurat, followed by data normalization, scaling, and dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for clustering. Pearson correlation coefficients were then calculated to assess transcriptional correlations between target genes ( Smyd3 Ucp1 P Statistical analysis Quantitative data were expressed as Means ± SD.
