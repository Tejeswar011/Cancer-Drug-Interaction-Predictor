Introduction Helicobacter pylori 1 2 3 4 5 6 Against this backdrop, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence technology offer a fresh perspective on anti-Hp treatment. The advantage of AI-assisted design is that it reduces a lot of economic costs and is efficient [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 Concurrently, probiotic delivery systems demonstrate multifaceted anti-Hp mechanisms, including competitive exclusion, immunomodulation, and mucosal barrier enhancement [ 13 14 15 16 17 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 An infection in the stomach, as the main colonization site of Hp, can cause various diseases such as gastritis, peptic ulcers, and even gastric cancer [ 19 20 21 22 23 This study integrates AI-driven antibody optimization with probiotic engineering to target Hp. The urease structure, modeled using AlphaFold2, was validated with SAVES6.0, and key active-site residues were identified through molecular docking via ClusPro2 and InterProSurf. Computational screening (mCSA-AB, I-Mutant, FoldX) generated nine antibody variants, with the optimal mutant (I107W) selected for expression in E. coli 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Molecular Dynamics Analysis and Evolutionary Design of Single-Domain Antibodies The anti-Hp monoclonal antibody used in this study originated from prior work in our laboratory. Intermolecular interactions between various antibodies and the Hp urease subunit B (UreB) were analyzed using PyMOL, I-TASSER, and ClusPro2, leading to the identification of the UreBAb sequence, a fully humanized single-domain variable light chain (VL) antibody targeting UreB (113 amino acids), hereafter referred to as “Ab” [ 24 https://alphafoldserver.com/ https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/ 25 26 Prior to protein docking, both antigen and antibody structures were pre-processed to improve docking accuracy. Using PyMOL ( https://pymol.org/2/ https://www.rcsb.org/ https://cluspro.org/help.php Following successful docking complex construction, active-site prediction and candidate mutation site analysis were performed. The complex structure was uploaded to the InterProSurf server ( https://curie.utmb.edu/pdbcomplex.html Once mutation sites were determined, three computational tools—mCSM-AB, FoldX, and I-Mutant—were employed to evaluate the antibody’s evolutionary potential. mCSM-AB predicted changes in Gibbs free energy (∆∆G = ΔGwt − ΔGmt), while FoldX used the following command for mutational scanning: FoldX –command = PositionScan –pdb = A.pdb –positions = position/chain/a. Here, a denotes scanning against all 20 common amino acids. Other options included d: 24 residues (20 standard + phosphorylated Tyr, Thr, Ser, and hydroxyproline); h: a hydrophobic residue set {“GLY”, “ALA”, “LEU”, “VAL”, “ILE”, “THR”, “SER”, “CYS”, “MET”, “LYS”, “TRP”, “TYR”, “PHE”, “HIS”}; c: a charged residue set {“ARG”, “LYS”, “GLU”, “ASP”, “HIS”}; and p: polar residues {“ARG”, “LYS”, “GLU”, “ASP”, “HIS”, “TRP”, “TYR”, “THR”, “SER”, “GLN”, “ASN”}. FoldX calculates free energy changes as ∆∆G = ∆Gmt − ∆Gwt, providing insight into the effects of mutations on antibody stability and binding affinity. 2.2. Single-Point Mutation and Vector Construction To validate the AI-predicted structural models, plasmid DNA was extracted from the laboratory-constructed pET28a-Ab vector and used as the template for reverse PCR with specifically designed single-point mutation primers. Mutation efficiency was assessed via agarose gel electrophoresis. Verified mutant plasmids were transformed into E. coli 600 Separately, the PTM151 expression vector was subjected to double restriction digestion using SpeI and SgrAI. The linearized vector was ligated with the target gene fragment via homologous recombination. The recombinant construct was transformed into E. coli 2.3. Molecular Dynamics Simulation After docking, the complex was subjected to molecular dynamics simulation using the GROMACS 2023.5 software. The all-atom oplsaa force field was used for its topology generation. The complex was placed in a cubic box, with the distance between each atom and the edge of the box set to 1 nm, and solvated using the spc three-point water model. An appropriate number of sodium ions or chloride ions were added to ensure that the charge in the system was zero. Energy minimization and system pre-equilibration were carried out. After the system reached equilibrium, a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation was performed at 310 K. After the simulation ended, periodic boundary condition processing was performed, and the trajectory was analyzed, including RMSD, RMSF, and the radius of gyration (Rg). 2.4. Animal Models Five-week-old female BALB/c mice (purchased from Spafur) were used to evaluate the oral efficacy of the engineered probiotics. Prior to experimentation, mice were acclimated for seven days under controlled environmental conditions: temperature 22 ± 1 °C, relative humidity 50 ± 5%, a 12/12 h light/dark cycle, and 15 air changes per hour. Food and water were provided ad libitum. All animals were individually marked for identification prior to model establishment. To neutralize gastric acid, 1 mL of 0.2 mol/L NaHCO 3 10 Table 1 Table 1 2.5. Detection of Hp Colonization in the Stomach Following dissection, the stomach tissues of the mice were excised and opened along the greater curvature to remove luminal contents. The cleaned gastric tissues were then homogenized using a tissue homogenizer to obtain uniform homogenates. One portion of the homogenate was plated onto Hp-selective solid medium containing appropriate additives. Plates were pre-inverted and incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 3 to 5 days. Bacterial colonization was assessed by counting visible colonies. Another portion of the homogenate was incubated with phenol red indicator for over 3 h. Urease activity, indicative of Hp presence, was quantified by measuring absorbance at 550 nm using a microplate reader. 2.6. ELISA Detection of Inflammatory Cytokines Homogenized gastric tissues from mice were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the supernatant for cytokine analysis. ELISA kits were equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min prior to use. Standard and sample wells were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Appropriate volumes of standards and test samples were added to the designated wells, followed by the addition of HRP-conjugated detection antibodies. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After washing, chromogenic substrates A and B were added sequentially, and the plates were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 15 min. The enzymatic reaction was terminated with a stop solution, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured immediately using a microplate reader. This procedure enabled the quantitative detection of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-4 in gastric tissue lysates. 2.7. 16S rDNA High-Throughput Sequencing of Gut Microbiota Approximately 2 mL of cecal contents was collected from each mouse, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Samples were then sent to the Bimake platform for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) representative sequences were classified taxonomically using the Greengenes database to generate OTU counts and relative abundance curves (RACs) at various taxonomic levels for each sample. Species richness was assessed using the Chao1 and Observed Species indices, while species diversity was evaluated with the Shannon and Simpson indices. Together with rarefaction curves and species coverage data, these metrics provided a comprehensive analysis of alpha diversity within the microbial communities. To assess between-group variation, beta diversity analysis was performed, including non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to visualize differences in microbial community structures across samples. Based on OTU annotations, the microbial composition at both the phylum and genus levels was profiled and visualized through distribution maps. 2.8. Statistical Analysis All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess statistical differences among groups. A p p p p p 3. Results 3.1. Identification of Affinity-Enhancing Sites and Mutant Screening via Structural Prediction and Computational Optimization To enhance the antigen-binding activity of the original antibody, an AI-assisted optimization workflow was implemented, integrating homology modeling using AlphaFold2 for single-domain antibody structure prediction with three computational design refinement tools: mCSM-AB, I-Mutant, and FoldX ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Structural analysis using PyMOL and InterProSurf identified ten key interaction residues within the antibody–antigen interface: K40, P41, K43, E82, F84, T86, K104, I107, K108, and R109. These residues were selected as candidate sites for targeted mutagenesis. A comprehensive screening workflow was applied: each of the 10 residues underwent exhaustive single-point substitution with 19 alternative amino acids. Changes in binding affinity and structural stability (ΔΔG values) were predicted using three computational tools—mCSM-AB, I-Mutant, and FoldX—with detailed results provided in Supplementary Tables S1–S4 Table 2 3.2. Engineering E. coli Nissle 1917 for High-Activity Expression of the Single-Domain Antibody Mutant (Ab-I107W) Experimental validation of the computational predictions was carried out through site-directed mutagenesis at the identified hotspot residues, followed by heterologous expression of the resulting antibody variants in E. coli Figure 2 Figure 2 Functional characterization of the mutants revealed enhanced antigen-binding affinity and urease-inhibitory activity across all variants, with the I107W substitution (isoleucine → tryptophan at position 107) exhibiting the most significant enhancement ( Figure 3 Figure 2 22 Figure 3 3.3. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Results of Mutants Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the final selected mutant. The RMSD values were used to evaluate the binding stability of the ligand–receptor complex. The mean RMSD values of the complex within 100 ns of the molecular dynamics simulation runtime were calculated to compare the differences in binding stability between the nanobody and urease. The overall RMSD value of the I107W mutant was higher than that of the wild type ( Figure 3 The RMSF values were used to analyze the fluctuation of the ligand–receptor complex during the simulation. The vertical axis represents the RMSF value, and a larger value indicates more intense dynamic fluctuation of the corresponding residue. The overall fluctuation of the wild-type complex had high and low peaks, and the RMSF peaks in certain regions (such as those with low residue indices) were high, indicating that the residues at these positions in the wild type had high flexibility and active movement; the fluctuation in most regions was relatively stable, reflecting regular dynamics ( Figure 3 The radius of gyration was used to measure the overall compactness of the protein during the simulation. The change in the radius of gyration of the mutant (I107W) was similar to that of the wild type, but the overall value was slightly lower (closer to 3.1–3.2 nm) with a relatively smaller fluctuation amplitude, indicating that the mutation made the overall conformation of the molecule more compact ( Figure 3 3.4. Engineered Probiotics Suppress Hp Colonization In Vivo To evaluate the anti-Hp efficacy of engineered probiotics, we established a murine infection model. Quantitative culture assays revealed significantly higher gastric Hp viable counts in the Hp-only group compared to the NC group ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Urease activity, quantified via phenol red indicator absorbance at 550 nm, correlated strongly with viable counts, further validating the therapeutic effects. Engineered probiotics significantly reduced Hp colonization in both therapeutic and prophylactic murine models, demonstrating potent anti-Hp efficacy, while non-antibody probiotics showed no effect ( Figure 4 3.5. Engineered Probiotics Regulate the Expression of Inflammatory Factors That Alleviate Hp Infection Hp infection is closely associated with altered levels of inflammatory cytokines in the gastric mucosa, particularly TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-4 [ 27 28 29 30 Quantitative ELISA analysis of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-4 ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 In the prophylactic cohort, early administration of engineered probiotics significantly reduced TNF-α levels relative to the Hp-only group ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 3.6. Engineered Probiotics Overinhibited Neutrophil Infiltration and Gastric Mucosal Structural Repair to Reduce Pathological Damage to Gastric Tissue Caused by Hp Infection Gastric histopathological analysis provides critical insights into Hp-induced tissue damage severity. Histopathological examination of infected gastric tissue sections revealed characteristic pathological alterations, including lesion progression and structural deterioration. Both Hp-only and Probiotic groups exhibited pronounced neutrophil infiltration accompanied by severe mucosal damage, manifested through disorganized epithelial cell arrangement and loosened connective tissue architecture—histological hallmarks of Hp-driven inflammatory pathogenesis ( Figure 6 Therapeutic intervention with the Ab Probiotic group substantially alleviated these pathological changes. Compared to the Drug monotherapy group, the Drug/Ab Probiotic group demonstrated enhanced therapeutic efficacy, characterized by restored epithelial polarity and compact stromal organization. Notably, prophylactic administration in the Prophylactic group also attenuated histological damage compared to the Hp-only group, though to a lesser extent than therapeutic interventions ( Figure 6 3.7. Engineered Probiotics Antagonize Hp Infection and Antibiotic Damage by Maintaining Gut Microbiota Diversity and Structural Remodeling 16S rRNA sequencing serves as a critical methodology for evaluating gut microbiota dynamics during Hp infection and post-intervention phases. Analysis of intestinal alpha diversity indices in the treatment group included the Chao1 index ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 31 Beta diversity analysis, as a core metric for assessing microbial community heterogeneity, effectively revealed structural differences through species composition quantification. This study utilized principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to visualize intergroup variations. Spatial distribution patterns demonstrated a significant negative correlation between sample distance and microbial similarity, closer proximity indicating higher homology in species composition and abundance characteristics. The distribution of OTU numbers in the treatment group ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 8 We analyzed the species distribution of the gut microbiota in different groups of mice ( Figure 8 Firmicutes Bacteroidota Proteobacteria 32 Figure 8 4. Discussion This study employed AI-driven antibody optimization through AlphaFold2-based homology modeling of a fully humanized single-domain antibody, integrating three computational methods (mCSM-AB, I-Mutant, and FoldX) for design refinement. The approach enhanced antibody–antigen binding activity by 24.95%, achieving 65.6% binding efficiency compared to the original UreBAb variant, aligning with current trends in AI-augmented antibody engineering. As demonstrated by Alireza et al. computational optimization improved anti-CD20 nanobody (NB2) binding capacity by 14.4% [ 33 34 35 36 37 Building on these computational advances, we engineered an EcN-based probiotic system for stable PTM151-I107WAb expression. In murine Hp infection models, the engineered probiotic significantly attenuated gastric inflammation and preserved mucosal integrity, contrasting with severe histopathological damage observed in both infected mice and positive drug-treated groups. These findings align with Miranda and Figueiredo’s [ 38 39 Hp infection disrupts gut microbiota homeostasis by altering microbial relative abundance [ 40 41 42 43 44 45 32 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria 46 While this study has demonstrated the anti-Hp potential of engineered probiotics, the field still faces two critical challenges that need to be addressed: the development of targeted delivery systems specifically for Hp gastric mucosal colonization and the comprehensive evaluation of long-term intervention effects on gastrointestinal microecological networks. Moreover, while this study advances AI-guided antibody optimization, certain limitations warrant discussion. Single-point mutagenesis may insufficiently drive comprehensive functional improvements, as structural cooperativity between residues often governs antibody performance. For instance, Chiba et al. achieved a 15 °C thermal stability enhancement in antibodies through synergistic double mutations (K43L/R109P) without compromising affinity [ 47 48 5. Conclusions In summary, the study established an AI-guided probiotic system targeting Helicobacter pylori, featuring a rationally designed single-domain antibody mutant (I107W) with 65.6% urease inhibition. Engineered EcN expressing I107W significantly reduced Hp colonization and suppressed inflammation in mice, while preserving gut microbiota stability. This strategy outperformed conventional treatments, offering a precise, safe, and microecologically friendly approach. Future research should focus on clinical translation, and delivery optimization for targeted biotherapeutic applications.
