It is a key enzyme in the folate metabolic cycle that is found in all dividing prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. 6–8 9–13 e.g. 9,11 11 11 14–16 17–19 20–22 23–25 11,26,27 28 11 Mycobacterium tuberculosis 29,30 30–32 30 33 34,35 X-ray crystallographic studies unveiled the overall similarities between M. tuberculosis 36,37 1DG5 M. tuberculosis Fig. 1 37,38 38 N E. coli 39,40 1DF7 37 37,39,40 Fig. 1 X-ray crystallographic structure of dihydrofolate reductase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 1DG5 Our in silico M. tuberculosis 1DG5 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Complete methodology of this study in a concise flowchart. 2 Materials and methods 2.1.

Evaluation of drug-likeness properties Drug-likeness is the structural or physicochemical properties of a drug-like molecule. A drug-like molecule can be considered as a drug candidate assessing the drug likeness properties. The freely accessible Swiss-ADME server ( http://www.swissadme.ch/index.php 49 50 51 52 53 2.4. ADMET prediction The evaluation of chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of the ligand is inevitable before designing a final drug. ADMET profile of 248 ligands was performed in admetSAR ( http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2/ 54,55 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ 42 2.5. Glide docking and MM-GBSA analysis A total of 30 ligands were selected from previous analyses. Then they were prepared and refined using the LigPrep option of Maestro Schrodinger Suite. 56 57 58 One of the essential parts of the docking study is defining grid box as it guides the drug-like molecule to the protein's ligand-binding region. Receptor Grid Generation module was used to acquire the grid map utilizing baseline parameters such as keeping a van der Waals radius scaling factor of 1.0 and a charge cutoff value of 0.25. XP Glide methodology was performed utilizing the Ligand docking module of Maestro Schrodinger Suite. XP (extra precision) mode of docking using Glide results in reproducible experimental binding affinity and accurate binding poses. A cutoff score of 0.15 and van der Waals radius scaling factor of 0.80 were assigned for ligand atoms. The glide docking score was determined based on ligand-protein binding complexes within the binding sites of receptors. The free binding energy of each ligand with the DHFR protein was computed employing the Prime MM-GBSA module of Maestro Schrodinger Suite. The module integrates the OPLS3e force field, VSGB solvation model to calculate the MM-GBSA scores using protein-ligand complexes. 58 2.6. Evaluation of interaction patterns and visualization BIOVIA Discovery Studio 4.1 Visualizer was implied to identify and visualize multiple non-bonded interactions within each ligand-protein docked complex. 59 2.7. Molecular dynamics simulation The MD simulation was performed in Schrodinger's Desmond module. 60 61–66 2.8. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The electrical structures of ligands are also linked to their pharmacological activities. It is important to examine the structural behavior of the active compound and to explore how structural orientation, any biological effect part in the structure, and what parameters may strength the biological activeness of the molecule. As a result, single-point energy calculations using DFT were performed in this study to explore the detailed aspects in terms of structure, electronics, and energy states of every atom of compound. Frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) of compounds specify the critical role of charge transfer interactions with the binding site of M. tuberculosis 67,68 3 Results 3.1. Molecular docking analysis A total of 1026 ligands were screened in the AutoDock-Vina application and the most desirable candidates were filtered out. Based on the bound conformations and the binding affinity of all the ligands with the protein, suitable ligands are chosen. Given that the lower binding energy indicates a higher affinity, the ligands with the lowest binding energy are considered to be the most suitable drug candidate. The binding energy of the control drug (trimethoprim) was kept at −12 kcal mol −1 3.2. Drug likeness Drug-likeness study determines the likelihood of a compound to be the best drug candidate analyzing its structural or physicochemical properties. The SwissADME online tool identifies compounds that meet the criteria for an optimal oral medication using five distinct pharmacokinetic rules (Lipinski, Ghose, Veber, Egan, and Muegge) based on different algorithms. A total of 452 drug-like compounds were examined for drug-likeness properties in our study. Initially, all of them were refined following Lipinski's rule of five filter criteria, including molecular weight (optimal range: <500), amount of hydrogen bond donors (optimal range: ≤5), amount of hydrogen bond acceptors (optimal range: ≤10), lipophilicity (expressed as Log P S 3.3. ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) analysis AdmetSAR is an effective platform for the prediction of comparative ADMET (chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiles of screened ligands. For the molecule to be analyzed, the site uses SMILES format as the input data. The ADME/ T In the absorption part, almost all ligands exhibit a high intestinal absorption rate, oral bioavailability, and positive Caco 2 permeability. Only the ligands with the most crucial value in comparison to others were chosen. In terms of distribution, however, not all of them are permeable to the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Following this, when it comes to distribution and excretion, none of the ligands inhibit any CYP450 enzymes, although a few of them act as substrates for CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, while others have no function as a substrate for any of the CYP450 enzymes. Finally, all the screened ligands showed negative results in carcinogenicity and Ames mutagenicity test. They also have no acute oral toxic or hepatotoxic activity. A total of 30 drug-like molecules were selected following AdmetSAR analysis (Table S4). 3.4. Glide docking and MM-GBSA analysis All 30 ligands were redocked, and the best candidates were chosen using the XP (extreme precision) mode. These ligands were also subjected to MM-GBSA analysis. Ligands with the highest XP glide and MM-GBSA values were considered to have the highest binding affinity. The glide scores for CHEMBL1770248, CHEMBL161702, and CHEMBL577 were −8.863, −9.62, and −8.813, respectively, whereas the control ligand trimethoprim and methotrexate displayed the lowest binding affinity of −7.08 and −7.797 (Table 1). However, MM-GBSA assessment revealed the comparative free binding energy of these ligands. The MM-GBSA scores of CHEMBL1770248, CHEMBL161702, and CHEMBL577 drug-like compounds were −71.98, −53.09, and −58.91 kcal mol −1 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 The non-bonded interaction of the top three docked complexes, where, A, B, and C indicates the interaction diagram of CHEMBL577, CHEMBL161702, and CHEMBL1770248, respectively. The first column depicts the surface view of the protein–ligand complex, with the ligand shown in red. The second column presents the pose view, illustrating ligand orientation and hydrogen bonding (red dashed lines) or hydrophobic contacts (yellow dashed lines) within the active site. The third column displays 2D receptor–ligand interaction maps, highlighting hydrogen bonds (green dashed lines) and hydrophobic interactions (pink dashed lines) with key amino acid residues. 3.5. Molecular dynamics simulations Following the docking calculations, the best 3 ligands, and control Trimethoprim and methotrexate -Mtb dihydrofolate reductase complexes, MD simulations were carried out using the Desmond Simulation Package for 100 ns. Root–mean–square deviation (RMSD) values, root–mean–square fluctuation (RMSF) values, and protein–ligand contacts were calculated from the MD trajectories. The solvated system of the ligand–protein docked complex was checked for its binding stability based on the RMSD fluctuations during the simulation. The RMSD fluctuation is measured individually for the protein and ligand structures in the trajectory of MD simulations; if it falls within 3 Å, then the complex is considered to be stable. 61,65,69–71 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Ligand RMSD profiles over 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations. RMSD values of fit ligand CHEMBL577 (green), CHEMBL161702 (orange), CHEMBL1770248 (gray) and control trimethoprim (gold) and methotrexate (blue) of the protein-ligand docked complexes. The RMSD of the CHEMBL577 gradually increased for 13 ns to 31 ns time span; after that, the curve showed minor RMSD fluctuation, signifying the stability of CHEMBL577. The RMSD plot of CHEMBL161702 shows minor fluctuation from the initial stimulation period of time to 25 ns, after which a similar RMSD trend was observed with the control complex. In the CHEMBL1770248-complex, ligand RMSD increased substantively for 55 ns and then stabilized RMSD between 1.2 Å and 1.8 Å for the rest of the simulation. The RMSD plot of proteins is displayed in Fig. 5 Fig. 5 RMSD values extracted from Cα of the protein–ligand docked complexes, viz. The RMSF values for Cα atoms of all residues were assessed using 100 ns trajectory data to examine the binding efficiency of lead compounds with Mtb Dihydrofolate reductase. The average RMSF values assessed for dihydrofolate reductase upon binding of trimethoprim, methotrexate, CHEMBL577, CHEMBL161702, and CHEMBL1770248 are 1.5 Å, indicating that all residues fluctuated within the RMSF range of 0.5 to 2.0 ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 RMSF analysis of Cα atoms for protein–ligand complexes. RMSF profiles for docked complexes, viz. The average total energies of trimethoprim-protein complexes and methotrexate–protein complexes were 9100 and 9199 kcal mol −1 −1 −1 −1 Throughout the 100 ns simulation, protein interactions with the ligand were also monitored. These interactions can be categorized by hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, ionic, and water bridges, as illustrated in Fig. 7 8 via Fig. 7A Fig. 7 Detailed atomic interaction of three best hits with the protein residues (PDB: 1DG5 Fig. 8 Detailed atomic interaction of the control ligand: (A) trimethoprim, and (B) methotrexate, with the protein residues (PDB: 1DG5 In the CHEMBL161702-dihydrofolate reductase complex, crucial hydrogen bond interaction was found with Arg45, Thr46, Ser49, Ile94, Gly96, Gly97, and Tyr100 over the course of the simulation. The amino acid residues Gly18, Asp19, Ile20, Arg23, Asp27, Gln28, Thr46, and Ser49 were involved in the H-bond formation with the molecule CHEMBL1770248 in the active site of 1DG5 Fig. 7 3.6. Post-dynamic MMGBSA To execute the post-dynamic MM-GBSA evaluation, the thermal_MMGBSA.py script of the Prime/Desmond module of the Schrodinger suite was applied. The post dynamic-MM-GBSA analysis of free binding energy evaluation was computed with the creation of 1 frame with 1000-step sampling size. The frame was processed and analyzed throughout the post-dynamic-MM-GBSA calculation of 100 ns MD data of control compound trimethoprim, and lead compounds CHEMBL577, CHEMBL161702 and CHEMBL1770248, as revealed by the studies of the dynamics. The post-MD MMGBSA binding free energies revealed notable differences in ligand ranking and stability profiles compared to pre-dynamic calculations. The calculated binding free energy (Δ G −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 3.7. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations The HOMO and LUMO orbitals govern how the molecule interacts with other species and help to explain its chemical reactivity and kinetic stability. HOMO and LUMO orbitals play a crucial role in charge transfer between these orbitals during a chemical process. HOMO energy represents the ability to donate an electron (electron-rich orbital) and the LUMO energy is related to accepting an electron (electron deficient orbital). The HOMO energy is proportional to the ionization potential, while the LUMO energy is proportional to the electron affinity. Furthermore, the energy gap (E) between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals is linked to interaction stability. It is a useful tool for determining the most bioactive compound. 64,72 Fig. 9 2 Fig. 9 Plots of the HOMO, LUMO, and 3D-MESP overlaid onto a surface of constant electron density of CHEMBL577, CHEMBL161702, CHEMBL1770248, and trimethoprim. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps further reinforced these observations by identifying electron-rich (red) and electron-deficient (blue) regions on the molecular surface. 72 −1 −1 4 Discussion Since the introduction of the computer-assisted molecular docking technique, a new era of drug discovery has begun. Because of multi-drug resistance mechanisms, therapeutic options for Mycobacterium tuberculosis M. tuberculosis Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a catalytic enzyme responsible for converting dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. This is a crucial step in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins in M. tuberculosis 20 10,30,31,33 The idea of drug-likeness, based on the interpretations of the physicochemical and structural attributes of small drug-like compounds, has been widely performed in drug designing to filter out compounds with properties consistent with accepted pharmacokinetic levels. 50,69,73 49 50 P 74 75 51–53 The pharmacokinetic profile of a drug-like molecule must be evaluated before discovering a drug to ensure that the drug can survive itself in the body, accomplish its function, and be eliminated effectively, which is termed ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination, Toxicity) properties. The absorption of a drug compound through the human intestinal cell lining is a fundamental way to determine the bioavailability of a compound after systemic administration. 76 in vitro in vivo  P P 77 78 79 80 81 While designing a drug, various toxicity tests should be performed, including hepatotoxicity, acute oral toxicity, carcinogenicity, and Ames mutagenesis. Hepatotoxicity associated with drugs is increasingly the leading cause of acute liver failure, liver transplantation, and, in the worst-case scenario, death. 82 83 84,85 The chosen ligands were then docked one more time with Maestro Schrodinger Suite. To estimate the ligand-binding affinity and compare the free binding energy of those ligands, the ligands were tested for the Glide XP and the MMGBSA score. The protein-ligand docked constructs were used to conduct the MM-GBSA derived binding free energy estimations. 86,87 Molecular dynamics simulation was used to validate the conformational stability of putative drugs following interaction with dihydrofolate reductase. The RMSD of ligands trimethoprim, methotrexate, CHEMBL577, CHEMBL161702, and CHEMBL1770248 showed a minor RMSD fluctuation throughout 100 ns simulation. The binding of the ligands CHEMBL161702 and CHEMBL1770248 did not produce conformational instability within proteins since the measured RMSD change after ligand binding followed the same pattern as the trimethoprim-protein complex. A comprehensive examination of the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) curve of Cα atoms indicated that our lead drugs maintained tight contact with their binding sites, as seen by their short fluctuation of 0.5 to 2.0 within dihydrofolate reductase. However, because of loop sections on dihydrofolate reductase, RMSF fluctuation was conspicuous. The 100 ns simulation of protein ligand interactions revealed that vGly18, Asp19, Ile20, Arg23, Asp27, Gln28, Thr46, and Ser49 residues were involved in the formation of H-bonds with the molecule CHEMBL1770248 at the active site of 1DG5 Lead compounds CHEMBL1770248, CHEMBL161702, and CHEMBL577 performed well and were considered to be the most efficient inhibitor of DHFR. These compounds CHEMBL577, CHEMBL161702, and CHEMBL1770248 are commercially available and approved, enabling direct procurement for in vitro https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ in vitro 5 Conclusions Drug repurposing is a well-known safety approach for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents, with the main benefit of shortening the time and expense of new drugs in a subsequent biomedical study.
