Introduction To a certain extent, the history of drug delivery is a joint history of pharmaceutical excipients and material conversion techniques [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Electrospinning—initially a textile technique alongside wet spinning, dry spinning, and other spinning processes that rely on mechanical forces—is becoming increasingly popular for producing a wide variety of medicated nanofibers [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) is always a major concern in developing novel nano-drug delivery systems [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 2 37 Based on the foregoing discussion, we hypothesized that a modified triaxial electrospinning strategy could be exploited to ensure high DEE values. The strategy involves using an electrospinnable, drug-free polymer solution as the middle fluid to prevent diffusion of the core fluid into the environment and employing pure ethanol as the outer fluid to ensure continuous and robust nanofabrication. Curcumin (Cur), an active biomolecule, was selected as a model drug both for its widespread use in functional nanomaterials for food, drug delivery, and biomedical engineering applications [ 38 39 40 41 42 43 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials Ethylcellulose (EC, viscosity 6–9 mPa·s, CAS No. 9004-57-3) was sourced from Aladdin Chemistry Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Curcumin (Cur, CAS No. 458-37-7), dichloromethane (DCM, CAS No. 75-09-2), and anhydrous ethanol (CAS No. 64-17-5) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.0) was purchased from Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Water was double-distilled immediately before use. All chemicals were used as received without further purification. 2.2. Electrospinning A laboratory-scale electrospinning system was constructed to prepare nanofibers, the key feature of which was a custom-designed, detachable triaxial eccentric spinneret. The setup comprised three syringe pumps (two KDS-100 and one KDS-200, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) for precise delivery of the working fluids, a high-voltage power supply (ZGF 60 kV/2 mA, Wuhan Hua-Tian, Wuhan, China) to generate the required electric field, and a grounded collector fabricated by wrapping aluminum foil around rigid cardboard for safety. Four distinct working fluids, whose compositions and operating parameters are listed in Table 1 Figures S1 and S2 in Supplementary Materials Figures S3 and S4 in Supplementary Materials 44 2.3. Characterizations of Physical Properties 2.3.1. Morphology Surface morphology of the three nanofiber types was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Quanta 450 FEG, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Prior to imaging, specimens were sputter-coated with platinum for 60 s to ensure adequate conductivity. Fiber diameters and size distributions were subsequently analyzed from the acquired micrographs using ImageJ software V1.8.0 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The applied voltage was 5 keV. 2.3.2. Inner Structure Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was employed to probe the internal architecture of the three EC-Cur nanofiber variants. To prepare specimens, a carbon-coated copper grid was positioned directly beneath the spinneret—immediately above the collector—and exposed to the electrospinning jet for approximately 15 s to harvest nanofibers. The settled electron acceleration voltage was 300 keV. 2.3.3. Physical State A Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) was used to assess the physical form of the raw EC and Cur powders, as well as the physical state of Cur within the three drug-loaded nanofibers (F1, F2, F3). The instrument employed a Cu Kα X-ray source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Data were collected from 5° to 40° 2θ with a step size of 0.02°and a scan rate of 10°/min −1 2.3.4. Compatibility Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) of neat Cur, EC powders, and their electrospun composite nanofibers were collected on a PerkinElmer spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA). Measurements were performed over 500–4000 cm −1 −1 2.4. Characterizations of Functional Performances 2.4.1. Encapsulation Efficiency (DEE %) A UV–Vis spectrophotometer (model UV-2102C, Unico Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used for all quantitative analyses of curcumin (Cur). A calibration curve was first constructed with standard solutions to relate absorbance to concentration. To determine the drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE%), Cur was recovered from the nanofibers as follows: (1) An accurately weighed nanofibrous sample was completely dissolved in anhydrous ethanol; (2) 1.0 mL of this ethanolic solution was slowly added to 1000 mL distilled water under vigorous stirring to precipitate the polymer and liberate Cur; (3) After centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min), the supernatant was analyzed spectrophotometrically; (4) The Cur concentration in the supernatant was calculated from the established calibration curve, and in turn the mass of Cur measured in the nanofibers (W m DEE % = ( W m W p (1) W m W p 2.4.2. In Vitro Release Studies The release kinetics of Cur from electrospun nanofibers (formulations F1, F2, and F3) were evaluated by the paddle method specified in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 Edition) as follows: (1) Nanofiber samples equivalent to 50 mg Cur were placed in vessels containing 600 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), thermostated at 37 °C. The paddles rotated at 50 rpm. (2) At predetermined intervals, 5.0 mL aliquots were withdrawn and immediately replaced with an equal volume of fresh PBS to maintain sink conditions. (3) The absorbance of each sample was measured with the UV–Vis spectrophotometer and converted to concentration (C, μg mL −1 (2) P ( % ) = C n ∗ V 0 + ∑ i = 1 n − 1 C i ∗ V Q 0 ∗ 100 V 0 V Q 0 C n −1 Cᵢ −1 2.5. Statistical Analysis All data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to detect significant differences among groups. When ANOVA indicated significance ( p 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. New EHDA Processes and Their Apparatus The EHDA apparatus has at least four fundamental parts for initiating an electrospinning process [ 45 46 47 48 49 50 Figure 1 51 52 53 54 55 In the literature, the homogeneous, core–sheath, and tri-layer core–sheath nanofibers are prepared using the monoaxial single-fluid blending electrospinning, coaxial electrospinning, and triaxial electrospinning, respectively. When emulsions were exploited as the treated fluids, the single-fluid blending electrospinning and coaxial electrospinning are able to create core–sheath and tri-layer core–sheath nanofibers [ 56 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 The importance of a spinneret not only lies in that the process can be termed according to its nozzle’s structure, but also in that it can be exploited to ensure a continuous and energy-saving process, ensure the production of high-quality nanofibers, and can also be revised conveniently for conducting other electrospinning processes. It is no strange that the spinneret is regarded as the most important element in an electrospinning apparatus and is full of innovations [ 57 58 37 Figure 2 A diagram about the inner routes for guiding three fluids from their inlets to the co-outlets is given in Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 3.2. Working Processes During the three electrospinning processes, a series of interesting phenomena were observed, some of which are captured in Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Gupta et al. declared that the sheath working fluid must be electrospinnable for conducting a coaxial electrospinning and a successful preparation of core–sheath nanofibers [ 59 60 61 w v Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure S1 and Figure S2, respectively, in the Supplementary Materials For the modified triaxial electrospinning, a spinnable EC solution with a concentration of 25% ( w v Figure S3 and Figure S4, respectively, in Supplementary Materials Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 3.3. Morphologies and Inner Structures EC has fine electrospinnability [ 60 62 Figure 4 The TEM images of the three types of nanofibers are given in Figure 5 Figure 5 The formation mechanisms of the three working processes, i.e., the single-fluid blending process, the coaxial electrospinning, and the modified triaxial electrospinning, are suggested in Figure 5 Figure 3 Figure 5 Figure 5 37 When an unspinnable EC solution was exploited as the sheath working fluid to conduct the coaxial electrospinning for creating the core–sheath nanofibers F2, the most fundamental drawing and drying mechanism is modified by the simultaneous traveling of two separate working fluids with an inner-outer relationship. The two trends of direct escape of Cur molecules to the surroundings with the evaporated solvent molecules and the Cur molecules enrichment on the surface of fluid jets and solid nanofibers would be greatly weakened, although there are still very slight yellow atmospheres around the core–sheath compound fluid jets in Figure 3 Figure 5 Figure 3 To further check the feasibility of the hypothesis, a spinnable EC solution but easy to clog spinneret with a concentration of 24% ( w v Figure 5 3.4. Physical State and Compatibility XRD patterns are frequently utilized to discern the physical state of drug molecules within their polymeric composites [ 63 64 65 66 Figure 6 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 The noises in the XRD patterns of EC and its three medicated fibrous nanocomposites show no significant differences when a similar large y Figure 6 y Figure 6 y 74 x Figure 6 EC is an inert polymeric carrier. It has been exploited to encapsulate many drug molecules and provide them the desired sustained release profiles. The precondition is that these drugs have fine compatibility with EC. Figure 7 Figure 7 EC has the characteristic absorbances at 1062 and 1102 cm −1 −1 37 41 3.5. Encapsulation Efficiency For quantitatively measuring the concentrations of Cur in its solutions, a standard equation reflecting the linear relationship between maximum absorbance at a certain wavelength ( A C Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 max A C The experimental results indicated that the developed strategy based on the modified triaxial electrospinning process was able to provide a high DEE% of 98.74 ± 6.45%, significantly larger than the values of DEE from the coaxial and blended processes, which were 93.74 ± 5.39% and 88.63 ± 7.36%, respectively. Cur has no sublimation property and has a high boiling point of 593.2 °C. In theory, the DEE% value should be 100% because electrospinning is essentially a rapid physical drying process. However, the measured data are lower than 100%, which aligns with the observations of a slight yellow Cur atmosphere during the preparation of composite nanofibers F1, F2 and F3. During electrospinning, ethanol molecules evaporated into the environment, by which the Cur molecules may follow them to be lost in the environments, thereby, a DEE value smaller than 100% is reasonable. Meanwhile, as diagrammed in Figure 5 3.6. Sustained Release Profiles Sustained release of the active ingredients can find its applications in a series of scientific and applied fields, such as drug delivery, cosmetics, tissue engineering, active food packaging, agriculture and fertilizer, and general health and care [ 75 76 77 78 79 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 EC is an insoluble in water, thus, it can be expected that Cur were released through the molecular penetrations of water molecules from the bulk solutions to the solid nanofibers and later the diffusion of Cur molecules from the nanofibers to the bulk solution. The regressed linear equations between Log(Q) and Log(t) of nanofibers F1, F2 and F3 are shown in Figure 9 80 81 82 83 3.7. Mechanisms of Sustained Release and the Related Process-Structure-Performance Relationship Shown in Figure 10 When the medicated nanofibers F2 are coated by a blank sheath layer of EC through the coaxial electrospinning, the structural nanofibers have almost no Cur molecules on their surfaces except a few Cur molecules diffused into the sheath sections during the bending and whipping processes. Meanwhile, the unspinnable EC solution can ensure a more robust and continuous working process, and in turn result in nanofibers with a more uniform size distribution. These factors are able to co-act to eliminate completely the initial burst release phenomena, to prolong the sustained release time period due to the intentional increase in diffusion routes of Cur molecules when they are dissolved by the penetrated water molecules, diffused from the core sections of nanofibers to the outer dissolution media through the sheath blank EC barrier layer. However, when a pure ethanol is exploited as an outer fluid and a spinnable EC solution is exploited as the middle fluid to increase the encapsulation effects, the resultant core–sheath nanofibers F3 have some advantages over their peers from the traditional coaxial process in the following aspects: (1) the sheath blank EC coating has fewer Cur molecules diffused from the inner blended solution due to the higher EC concentration and the larger viscosity; (2) the denser sheath section due to the outer ethanol can prevent the previous formations of semi-solid substance to let the exhaustion of ethanol molecules in the middle and also inner working fluids; and (3) the outer ethanol can ensure a longer time period of drawing and the stability of electrospinning processes, and in turn their smallest size distribution. These favorable factors can make the core–sheath nanofibers F3 further improve the sustained release profiles with an even larger DEE% value. Thereby, the modified triaxial electrospinning can be exploited to provide the best process–structure–performance relationship for the sustained release of Cur molecules from the EC matrices. New techniques for efficient materials conversion are in high demand across many scientific disciplines. Reported modified tri-axial electrospinning possesses several unique advantages over conventional electrospinning: (1) it enables continuous, robust operation free of clogging or other anomalies; (2) it can process otherwise unspinnable fluids, thereby expanding the range of polymers that can be converted into nanofibers; (3) it allows facile manipulation of core–shell nanostructures; and (4) it reliably maintains the desired process–structure–performance relationship. Building on the broad applicability of blending electrospinning [ 84 85 82 83 86 87 88 4. Conclusions A modified triaxial electrospinning protocol was devised in which a viscous EC solution served as the intermediate layer to isolate an inner Cur-loaded fluid. This high-EC middle layer effectively blocks outward diffusion of Cur during jet formation. A third, outermost shell of pure ethanol was introduced to lubricate the spinneret, eliminating clogging and allowing uninterrupted fabrication of core–sheath nanofibers F3. Performance comparisons illustrate the benefits of this architecture: (1) Versus homogeneous (F1) and traditional coaxial (F2) fibers, F3 achieved a Cur DEE%; (2) The core–sheath geometry suppressed the initial burst release common to F1 and F2, extending the sustained-release time periods. The formation mechanism of the tri-layer jet is discussed in detail, together with how the core–sheath geometry modulates drug diffusion. The work thereby establishes a clear process–structure–performance linkage and offers a general blueprint: an auxiliary solvent stream can be added to existing electrospinning setups to create more sophisticated nanostructures with improved or entirely new functionalities.
