EMFs may exhibit unique behaviors, such as an enhanced absorption rate or scattering of electromagnetic waves, excitation of plasmonic resonance, hypothermic activation, and electroporation phenomena ( 33–36 37 34 33 38 To address this knowledge gap, we used an in vivo Drosophila melanogaster 39 40 39 In this study, we investigated the impact of multigenerational non-thermal 2.4 GHz EMF and ZnO NP exposure on adult Drosophila melanogaster 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Drosophila The Oregon R strain of Drosophila melanogaster in vivo 2.2 Exposure EMF exposure was performed via a gigahertz transverse electromagnetic (GTEM) cell [GTEM 250A SAE model]. The EMF source was a certified horn-shaped GTEM cell ( Figure 1 Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila Figure 1 Image of the horn-shaped GTEM cell (GTEM 250A SAE model) used for EMF exposure. A GTEM (Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic) cell setup is displayed on a lab bench, labeled GTEM 250A SAE. Multiple red lines connect the main GTEM cell to inset images, showing detailed measurements displayed on screens and a test object inside the cell. The setup includes connected cables and electronic equipment, demonstrating electromagnetic testing and measurement processes. ZnO NPs [CAS No. 1314-13-2, >97% Catalog No. 677450-5G, Sigma Chemical Co. Ltd., USA] were used for this study because of their extensive application in various fields. ZnO NPs were spherical with a size of 23 ± 2 nm (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and the mean hydrodynamic size of particle was 110 ± 2 nm in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Dynamic Light Scattering), with a polydispersity index of 0.2 ( 41 41 42 Drosophila Drosophila melanogaster To investigate the combined effects of ZnO NPs and EMF radiation on flies, a total of 12 groups of fly vials ( n 2.3 Longevity To study the effects of ZnO NPs and EMF on lifespan, we employed a longevity assay in Drosophila 2.4 Crawling assay The crawling assay was used as a behavioral and neurological assessment tool to evaluate larval locomotion, leveraging the well-established correlation between crawling patterns and neuronal function. To facilitate this analysis, a 1.5% agar substrate was prepared in a petri dish, which provided a controlled environment for larval movement. Specifically, third instar larvae were collected for this study, and then the larvae were rinsed with MilliQ to eliminate residual food debris. The larvae were subsequently placed on the agar for 30 s, after which it was allowed to leave distinct trail marks indicative of their locomotor activity. This methodology enables the quantitative analysis of larval crawling behavior by measuring the distance travelled by the larvae ( Supplementary Figures S1, S2 2 2.5 DCFDA-ROS measurement The DCFDA assay was used to measure intracellular ROS and evaluate oxidative stress induced by combined exposure to ZnO NPs and EMF in Drosophila melanogaster 43 2.6 Two-choice taste assay Drosophila melanogaster 2.7 Phenotyping In this study, flies from two subsequent generations (F1 and F2) were comprehensively examined under a stereo microscope (OLYMPUS Co. Japan) for phenotypic abnormalities caused by NPs and EMF exposure. Following exposure, the wings, eyes, thorax, body color, and other physical features were examined for potential abnormalities. Each treatment was conducted twice to ensure accurate and consistent outcomes. Since the exposure was repeated three times, approximately 300 and 450 flies were screened for phenotypic abnormalities for each treatment, for a total of 1,000 to 1,300 flies per generation. 2.8 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the data was performed via GraphPad Prism software (version 5). All the data are presented as the means ± standard deviations. The analysis included the application of Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, and the calculation of the arithmetic mean with standard deviation via one-way ANOVA. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyse the survival results. A p 3 Results 3.1 Longevity Survivalship assay, performed on flies exposed to EMF and ZnO NPs independently and in combination between duration of EMF exposure and concentrations of the NPs showed subtle interaction. When flies were exposed solely to EMF, there was an observable, time-dependent increase in survival, as shown in Figure 2B Figure 2E Figure 2 Percent survival of adult flies exposed to EMF, ZnO NPs, and co-exposure. (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) Five-panel image showing survivorship data over time and a summarizing table. Panel A: Line graph with multiple treatments, showing survivorship percentage over 62 days. Panel B: Highlights survivorship for controls and different EMF durations. Panel C: Compares control and 0.1 mM ZnO NP treatments. Panel D: Displays 0.5 mM ZnO NP treatments. Panel E: Table summarizing treatments, noting survival increase or decline, and durations significant changes occur. Flies exposed to 0.1 mM ZnO NPs alone did not exhibit significant changes in survival ( Figure 2A Figure 2B Figure 2E Flies exhibited a marked decline in survival when exposed to 0.5 mM ZnO NPs alone, with survival decreasing steadily from day 7 to day 50 ( Figure 2E Figure 2A 3.2 Crawling In the F1 progeny, 30 min of EMF exposure caused a slight decline in crawling behavior ( Figure 3A Figure 3B Figure 3 Crawling behavior of third instar larvae exposed to EMF (10, 20, and 30 min), ZnO NPs (0.1 mM and 0.5 mM), and their co-exposure. The bar graph presents a comparative analysis of the various exposure conditions in the (A) (B) p Bar charts labeled F1 and F2 show the distance crawled in centimeters per thirty seconds under various conditions. F1 displays smaller, more consistent distances across all groups. In F2, the \"EMF 10 min\" condition shows a notable increase, marked with an asterisk, indicating a significant result. Other groups have varying distances with overlapping error bars. Both charts compare control and experimental conditions, including different durations and concentrations of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs). 3.3 Oxidative stress In the parent flies (F0), no significant changes in oxidative stress levels were observed, neither when exposed to ZnO NPs and EMF individually nor when exposed to their combination. Only a significant induction of oxidative stress was noted when the flies were exposed to a combination of 0.1 mM ZnO NPs and EMF for 20 and 30 min ( Figure 4A Figure 4B Figure 4 ROS levels in adult flies following EMF and ZnO NP exposure quantified using DCFDA assay and expressed as relative fluorescence intensity units per mg of protein (control = 100%). The bar graph shows ROS levels in (A) (B) p Bar graphs labeled F0 and F1 display data on the percentage of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under various conditions. Conditions include control, EMF exposure durations, ZnO nanoparticles, and combinations thereof. F1 shows higher ROS levels, especially in nanoparticle and EMF combinations, marked by asterisks indicating statistical significance. 3.4 Two choice tasting assay The two-choice tasting assay was used to assess the effect on sensory abilities caused by co-exposure to ZnO NPs and EMF. The preference index (PI) of parent flies (F0) subjected to EMF for 10, 20, and 30 min showed a gradual deterioration, with the most notable damage occurring at 30 min ( Figure 5A Figure 5B Figure 5C Figure 5 Two-choice feeding preference assay in adult flies exposed to EMF and ZnO NPs. PIs of flies in (A) (B) (C) p Three bar graphs labeled F0, F1, and F2 show the Preference Index (PI) across various conditions including control, electromagnetic fields (EMF) for different durations, and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) at different concentrations. Each graph depicts PI values with error bars for each condition. Significant differences are marked with asterisks. The x-axis lists conditions, while the y-axis measures PI from -1.0 to 1.0. Compared with the individual effects of EMF, the co-exposure of parent flies (F0) to 0.1 mM ZnO NPs and EMF led to a more pronounced decline in PI; however, a marked decline was observed at 10 and 20 min, followed by partial recovery at 30 min, suggesting fluctuating sensitivity across generations ( Figure 5B Figure 5C In the F0 generation, a significant decline in the PI was observed with 0.5 mM ZnO NP exposure alone, which was further exacerbated when ZnO NPs was combined with EMF, particularly at 20 and 30 min ( Figure 5A Figure 5B 3.5 Phenotyping To study the effects of EMF, ZnO NPs, and their co-exposure, flies were carefully examined under a stereomicroscope for visible morphological changes in Drosophila Figure 6 Supplementary Figure S3 Figure 6 Phenotypic abnormalities in F1 and F2 progeny after EMF exposure for 10, 20 and 30 min. (A) (B) (C) (D, E) (F) (G) (H) (I) Nine panels show close-up views of fruit flies, Drosophila, each with a red arrow pointing to different parts of their bodies, highlighting various features. Each image shows deformity developed in flies especially tergite deformations. 4 Discussion Simultaneous exposure to EMFs and NPs is becoming more common as technology continues to advance and become more integrated into our daily lives. The combined exposure of EMFs and ZnO NPs yields an interaction that can modulate multiple outcomes, either increasing toxicity, suppressing it or eliminating completely. It is essential to understand these combined effects to accurately assess any potential risks to the environment and human health. In pursuit of this understanding, this study investigated the combined effects of EMF and ZnO NPs on biological functions of Drosophila melanogaster One key finding of our study was the significant impact of EMF exposure on lifespan ( Figure 2 44 45 45 46 47 62 63 48–50 51 52 Drosophila Further in support of transgenerational impact, we observed that the ROS level was minimal in parent flies but elevated in the progeny. These findings are consistent with prior research by ( 53 Drosophila. 53 54 Co-exposure of EMFs and ZnO NPs resulted in a significant reduction in taste perception in the directly exposed generation (F0), indicating that the nervous system is especially sensitive to these stressors. Similar findings were reported by other studies that highlighted how combined environmental stressors such as heavy metals and NPs caused cumulative damage to sensory and cognitive functions in animal models ( 55 10 To solidify the basis of our study, phenotypic analysis also provided additional evidence of heritable effects and mitigating effects of EMF exposure and the combination of EMF and ZnO NPs. In our study, we observed a heritable tergite patterning defects such as crisscross pattern in the tergites of exposed flies. The unusual crisscross arrangement of bristles and cuticular structures, notably on the dorsal segments (tergites), indicates an underlying disturbance in the signaling pathways that determine cell polarity and segmental identity. The hedgehog (hh) engrailed (en) hh 56–58 hh 59 60 Our findings also correspond to the literature on pigmentation variation, specifically the significance of the ebony gene in tergite pigmentation. According to the existing literature ebony is essential for melanin biosynthesis pathway and is responsible for the clinical heterogeneity in tergite pigmentation found across different Drosophila 61 The findings of the present study suggest that EMF exposure can independently increase survival and improved the toxicity induced by ZnO NPs. Combined exposure to EMFs and ZnO NPs intensifies oxidative stress, motor function impairment and sensory deficits, which deteriorate progressively across subsequent generations. EMF exposure induces heritable phenotypic deformities, and co-exposure reversed these phenotype deformities. 5 Conclusion This study reveals that coexposure to ZnO NPs and EMF in Drosophila melanogaster The author is thankful to the Ministry of Defense, DRDO, for providing funding for the research work.
