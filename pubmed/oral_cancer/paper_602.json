Background Restoring intestinal barrier function is considered an effective strategy for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Rhynchophylline (Rhy), a bioactive alkaloid sourced from the traditional herbs Uncariarhynchophylla used in Chinese medicine, is known for its antihypertensive, anti-asthmatic, and antitumor properties. This study explores the pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms of Rhy in treating IBD. Methods In vitro cell inflammation injury model was established, and the inflammatory factors, cell permeability, cell proliferation, and intercellular tight junction protein expression were measured after Rhy intervention, which verified the anti-inflammatory activity and enhancement of intestinal barrier function of Rhy. In vivo animal model of acute and chronic colitis was established, and Rhy was administered orally at three dose levels to evaluate the protective effects of Rhy on acute and chronic colitis in animals. The signaling pathways that enhance the intestinal barrier function of Rhy were identified through transcriptomics, gene knockout techniques, and molecular dynamics simulations. Results In vitro results indicate that the levels of inflammatory markers–including IL-6, TNF-α, and NO–can be decreased by Rhy, demonstrating anti-inflammatory activity. It significantly lowers cellular permeability, promotes the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, and upregulates the expression of tight junction proteins Claudin4, Occludin, and ZO-1. These effects improve cellular morphology and improve the robustness of the intestinal barrier. In vivo, using three types of colitis animal models, Rhy shows significant protective effects on mice with acute and chronic colitis. It markedly reduces weight loss and Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores, prevents colonic shortening, reduces intestinal permeability, and decreases serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL1, and IL-1β. These effects restore the structural integrity of colonic tissues and alleviate symptoms of acute and chronic colitis. Additionally, Rhy activates the AhR-NR4A1 pathway. This activation upregulates Claudin4, Occludin, and ZO-1 to repair the intestinal barrier and exert anti-colitic effects. Conclusion These findings highlight Rhy improve the function and inhibits inflammation, providing dual beneficial activities in the epithelial lining of the gut to prevent and treat colitis.

Although the exact causes of IBD are not fully understood, these factors are considered critical in driving the progression of IBD ( Cantón et al., 2024 Levy et al., 2017 Sonnenburg and Bäckhed, 2016 Belkaid and Hand, 2014 Quaglio et al., 2022 Gop et al., 2018 Gouteng (Uncaria rhynchophylla), a traditional Chinese herb from the Rubiaceae family, recognized for its hooked stems used in medicine. It clears heat (reduces inflammation), calms the liver (alleviates hypertension and dizziness), and stops internal wind (controls tremors and seizures). Clinically applied for high blood pressure, pediatric fever-induced convulsions, and anxiety disorders. Modern research attributes these effects to alkaloids like rhynchophylline ( Yang et al., 2020 Chen et al., 2024 Ballester Roig et al., 2021 Jiang et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2023 Geetha and Ramachandran, 2021 We evaluated Rhy’s activity in this research and discovered that, in addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, it also enhances intestinal barrier function. We demonstrated that Rhy activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-nuclear receptor subfamily four group A member 1 (NR4A1) pathway, inducing increased expression of tight junction proteins Claudin4, Occludin, and ZO-1, thereby reducing intestinal permeability and enhancing barrier function. Furthermore, oral administration of Rhy significantly alleviated systemic inflammation and symptoms of colitis, suggesting its potential therapeutic role in IBD and indicating that Rhy might offer a promising treatment option for IBD. 2 Methods 2.1 Materials Rhynchophylline (Rhy) was acquired from Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (batch number C22M11S113789). Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) was purchased from Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (batch number C12750877). Mouse fecal occult blood test kits were obtained from Shanghai Enzyme-linked Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (batch number 0701A22). ELISA kits were sourced from Shanghai Jianglai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., and all antibodies were purchased from Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Mouse monocyte-macrophage cells (RAW264.7) and human colorectal cancer cells (Caco2) were acquired from Wuhan Punuosai Life Science Co., Ltd. (product numbers CL-0190 and CL-0050), and human colon epithelial cells (NCM460) were purchased from Shanghai Jining Industrial Co., Ltd. (product number JN26629). 2.2 Experimental animals Sixty 5-week-old male C57BL/6J mice, weighing between 20 ± 2 g, were procured from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (license number SCXK (Jing) 2016–0006). These mice were maintained at the Laboratory Animal Center of Xinjiang Medical University, which operates under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, with license SYXK (Xin) 2016–0002. The housing conditions were maintained with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, at a temperature of 21 °C ± 2 °C, and a humidity of 40%–45%. The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Xinjiang Medical University Laboratory Animal Center, ethical approval number: IACUC-20211016–39. All mice were acclimated for 1 week before the experiments. Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of 3% sodium pentobarbital solution. 2.3 Cell culture and treatment Cells were cultured in DMEM enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin 100 U/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/mL) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 Escherichia coli METTL3, 2024 2.4 Cell proliferation of NCM460 was determined by CCK-8 assay Additionally, to evaluate the effect of Rhy on the viability of NCM460 cells, these cells were co-cultured with 2% DSS for 24 h to mimic chemical-induced inflammation ( Chassaing et al., 2014 2.5 DSS-induced colitis Acute colitis was induced in C57BL/6J mice using DSS. We randomly divided the mice into these groups: Control, Model, Dexamethasone (DXM, 4 mg kg -1 -1 -1 -1 ad libitum -1 -1 -1 -1 2.6 Assessment of colitis severity and tissue collection The mice were assessed daily for body weight, fecal consistency, and rectal bleeding to compute the Disease Activity Index (DAI) ( Mulberry Anthocyanins Ameliorate, 2024 2.7 Lipopolysaccharide-induced peritonitis Male C57BL/6J mice, aged 6–8 weeks, were randomly assigned into three groups: Control, Model, and Rhy group. The control and model groups received the same volume of 0.25% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) orally, while the Rhy group was administered 4 mg/kg Rhy via gavage at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. After 24 h, peritonitis was induced in the mice by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (2 mg kg -1 2.8 RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated from cells/tissues using an RNA tissue kit, and reverse transcription was performed using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit. The synthesized cDNA was then mixed with 100 nM real-time PCR primers LLC and 1× TB Green Premix Ex Taq II for gene expression analysis using the CFX96™ Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). Gene expression changes were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCT 2.9 Intestinal permeability assessment Intestinal permeability was evaluated both in vitro in vivo In vitro 2  In vivo 2.10 Phalloidin assay to assess the impact of rhynchophylline on the cytoskeleton of Caco-2 cells Caco-2 cells were divided into Control, Model, and Rhynchophylline (50 μM) groups, and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were rinsed 2–3 times with PBS, followed by permeabilization with 5 mg mL -1 -1 2.11 EdU (5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) assay to evaluate the Effect of Rhynchophylline on Caco-2 Cell Proliferation Caco-2 cells were divided into Control, Model, and Rhynchophylline (50 μM) groups. Cells were adjusted to a density of 1 × 10 5 4 2.12 Western blot to detect protein expression in colonic tissue Colonic tissue samples were lysed using Lysis Buffer to extract proteins, which were then separated by centrifugation. The lysed protein samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, proteins on the polyacrylamide gel were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C for 24 h, followed by washing. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour and then washed again. The membrane’s protein expression was visualized with ECL and analyzed with ImageJ software. Concurrent with each target gene detection, the reference gene is simultaneously assayed in triplicate to ensure synchronous detection of both the reference and target genes, thereby maintaining the stability of the reference gene across all target gene detection cycles. 2.13 Transcriptomic analysis Transcriptomic analysis was conducted by Biotree Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). An mRNA sequencing library was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA, and its concentration was quantified using the Qubit fluorometric quantitation method. Sequencing was performed on the HiSeq X10 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Colonic tissues from the control group (Group A), model group (Group B), and Rhy group (Group C) mice were collected. Total RNA was extracted from the colonic tissues of each experimental group using RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa, Japan), and the integrity of the isolated RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2,100 bioanalyzer (RIN >9.5). 2.14 Molecular docking of Rhy with AhR The X-ray crystal structure of the AhR_HUMAN protein (Uniprot ID: P35869 Dong et al., 2021 Pinzi and Rastelli, 2019 2.15 Molecular dynamics simulation of Rhy with AhR Molecular dynamics simulations were used to explore the spatial conformational changes of the Rhy-AhR complex. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was calculated to assess the overall stability and variations of the molecular structure. The root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) measured the degree of oscillation for each atom during the simulation, revealing the flexibility and dynamic behavior of individual atoms. The radius of gyration (RG) was calculated to evaluate the protein’s shape and volume. The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was calculated to assess the protein’s surface area available for interaction with the solvent, reflecting the extent to which the protein unfolds in solution. These metrics were used to evaluate the dynamic equilibrium of the Rhy-AhR system. 2.16 Immunofluorescence detection of intestinal barrier protein expression in Caco-2 cells Caco-2 cells (5 × 10 4 2 2.17 Cyp1A1 enzyme activity assay Three groups were formed from the mice: Vehicle, Rhy, and FICZ (6-Formylindolo [3,2-b]carbazole, a potent AhR agonist) groups, receiving oral administration daily for 1 week. One week after the experiment began, mice were euthanized, and their colon and liver tissues were harvested to extract microsomes. Initially, the liver was rinsed with 0.9% sodium chloride solution to remove adhering blood and solution. The tissues were then homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 250 mM sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000 rpm at 4 °C for 60 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in the supernatant from the first centrifugation and was used for subsequent protein content and CYP enzyme activity analysis. 2.18 Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay 0.5 mg of microsomal protein was mixed with 200 µL of Tris buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) containing 0.01 mM ethoxyresorufin. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.1 mM NADPH and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. To stop the reaction, an equal volume of acetonitrile was added. The mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The resorufin levels in the supernatant were determined by a fluorescence assay. 2.19 P450-Glo Cyp1A1 luminescence assay NCM460 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 10 4 2.20 Gene knockdown experiments AhR siRNA (abx907072) and NR4A1 siRNA (abx926351) were obtained from Amyjet Scientific. In the knockdown experiments, Caco-2 cells (0.5 × 10 6 2 2.21 Statistical analysis All result analyses were realized with the application of GraphPad Prism version 9. For continuous variables, the presentation was in the form of mean ± standard deviation; categorical variables were reported as percentages. Experimental results between the two groups were analyzed using unpaired Student’s t post hoc post hoc P 3 Results 3.1 Anti-inflammatory activity and induction of tight junction protein expression by Rhy Rhynchophylline (Rhy) significantly reduced the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and NO in LPS-induced RAW264.7 mouse monocyte-macrophage cells, demonstrating anti-inflammatory activity at concentrations as low as 0.5 μM ( Figure 1A Figure 1B Figure 1C Figure 1D Figure 1E Figure 1F Figure 1G FIGURE 1 Rhy is a potent anti-inflammatory chemical compound and induces tight junction proteins. (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) a P b P Charts and images display effects of varying doses of Rhy on TNF-a, IL-6, NO, and cell viability (A-D). Microscopy images (E-G) show cellular changes across control, model, and Rhy treatment groups, highlighting fluorescence in different conditions. 3.2 Rhy alleviates acute colitis in mice Rhy provided significant protection against 3% DSS-induced acute colitis in mice. The model group’s Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores increased progressively, with visible bloody stool occurring between days 5 and 7, indicating successful model induction (P < 0.01). Compared to the model group, Rhy significantly mitigated weight loss and DAI scores in colitis mice, prevented colonic shortening, and reduced intestinal permeability, suggesting an alleviation of colitis symptoms ( Figures 2A–D,J Figure 2E Figures 2F–I FIGURE 2 Rhy treatment attenuates DSS-induced colitis in mice (n = 10).

Panel A and B show line graphs of body weight and disease activity index over time for different treatment groups. Panels C-I display bar graphs of various biomarkers, including FITC-DEX, MPO, IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL1, and IL-1β, across different groups. Panel J contains a photograph comparing colon samples among different treatments, with corresponding bar graphs for colon length and CMDI score. Panel K features histological images of colon tissue sections from each group. Panel L presents a Western blot analysis for ZO-1 and β-actin, alongside a bar graph quantifying ZO-1/β-actin ratio. HE staining of colonic tissues from IBD model mice showed severe mucosal erosion, evident epithelial defects, and destruction of crypt architecture, with extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells in the mucosa and submucosa. After treatment with Rhy, the structural integrity of colonic tissues was largely restored, with reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. Additionally, goblet cells were neatly arranged, and colonic inflammation was significantly improved ( Figure 2K Figure 2L 3.3 Rhy treatment alleviates chronic colitis in mice The therapeutic effect of Rhy was also examined in a chronic colitis model induced by 2% DSS. Mice consumed 2% DSS water for four cycles, each lasting 7 days with a 14-day interval of normal water consumption between cycles ( Figure 3A Figures 3B–D Figures 3F–I Figure 3E Figure 3J FIGURE 3 Rhy prevent DSS-induced chronic colitis.

Panels A-I include bar charts comparing treatments: Control, Model, Rhy-L, Rhy-M, Rhy-H, and Dexamethasone (DXM). Metrics include FITC-DEX, colon length, colon weight length, MPO, IL-6, TNF-α, CXCL1, and IL-1β levels. Panel J shows a Western blot analysis comparing ZO-1 expression with β-actin as a control, and a bar graph depicting the ratio of ZO-1 to β-actin between vehicle-treated and Rhy-treated samples. 3.4 Rhy prevents colitis in mice Due to the strong intestinal barrier protective activity demonstrated Rhy through the upregulation of tight junction proteins, we investigated the preventative effects of Rhy in a DSS-induced colitis model. Mice were pre-treated orally with Rhy for 3 days prior to a 3-day DSS induction of colitis, during which no further Rhy treatment was administered ( Figure 4A Figure 4B Figures 4C–F Figures 4G–K FIGURE 4 Rhy prevent DSS-induced colitis and sustain beneficial barrier activities (n = 10).

Panels D to K display bar graphs comparing control, vehicle, Rhy-pre DSS, and Rhy-post DSS groups in terms of FITC-DEX, colon length, colon weight/length ratio, MPO, IL-6, TNF-alpha, CXCL1, and IL-1beta levels. Each graph indicates significant differences with labels “a” and “b.” 3.5 Rhy enhances intestinal barrier function via AhR mediation Given that CYP1A1 is a key downstream effector of the AhR signaling pathway, the analysis of CYP1A1 activity provides insights into whether Rhy activates AhR to enhance intestinal barrier function. Real-Time PCR data indicated a significant increase in CYP1A1 mRNA levels in response to Rhy treatment ( Figure 5A Figure 5B in vivo Figure 5C Figure 5D FIGURE 5 Rhy enhance tight junction proteins in AhR-dependent manner. (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (A) (B) (C) (D) (G) (H) (I) (J) a P b P The image contains multiple panels displaying data related to biochemical assays and molecular interactions. Panel A shows a bar graph of CYP1A1 activity changes. Panel B presents western blot results and bar graphs for CYP1A1 expression across different treatments. Panel C illustrates EROD assay results measuring CYP1A activity in colon and liver. Panel D includes another bar graph for CYP1A1 activity involving different concentrations of Rhy and FICZ. Panel E displays results from an AhR reporter assay. Panels F to J include various biochemical data, protein structure images, and microscopy visuals depicting molecular dynamics, interactions, protein expression, and cellular localization under different experimental conditions. These observations confirm that Rhy not only boosts CYP1A1 expression but also enhances its enzymatic activity through AhR activation. Additionally, in the Caco-2 cell line, the direct activation of AhR by Rhy was evaluated using an XRE-luciferase reporter gene system. Data indicated that 50 µM Rhy triggered a five-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to the vehicle, demonstrating significant AhR activation. In contrast, 50 µM FICZ led to a nine-fold increase in luciferase activity, highlighting a higher level of AhR activation by the potent agonist FICZ compared to Rhy treatment ( Figure 5E Molecular dynamics simulations of the Rhy-AhR system demonstrated structural stability and overall kinetic stability, which is conducive to the effective pharmacological action of Rhy ( Figure 5F Figure 5G Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that the proteins Claudin4, Occludin, and ZO-1 are primarily located at the intercellular contact areas, forming continuous linear structures that regulate paracellular permeability. The cell nuclei appeared as blue dots stained with DAPI. Compared to the control group, the fluorescence intensity of Claudin4, Occludin, and ZO-1 was reduced in the model group; following Rhy intervention, the fluorescence intensity of Claudin4, Occludin, and ZO-1 increased compared to the model group ( Figure 5H Western blot results revealed that in a DSS-induced acute colitis mouse model, compared to normal controls, the expression levels of Cyp1A1 and intestinal barrier proteins such as ZO-1, Claudin4, and Occludin were significantly decreased. Treatment with Rhy notably enhanced the expression of these proteins in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5I Figure 5J 3.6 Rhy enhances intestinal barrier function through NR4A1 mediation Further RNA-Seq analysis of colonic tissues from IBD mice revealed that between the control group and the model group, there were 1746 differentially expressed mRNAs, with 1056 genes upregulated and 690 downregulated ( Figure 6A Figure 6B Figure 6C Figure 6D Figures 6E,F Figure 6G Figure 5J FIGURE 6 NR4A1 is required for Rhy mediated upregulation of tight junction proteins.

Panel I contains close-up views of molecular docking interactions. Panels J and K include bar graphs and a Western blot image showing expression levels of various proteins and mRNA. Since AhR is essential for Rhy-mediated activity, we hypothesized that AhR binds to the NR4A1 promoter sequence. Based on predictions from the MEME Suite, we successfully identified the binding sites between AhR and NR4A1, including the binding site of AhR_HUMAN (612AA-660AA) and the NR4A1 promoter sequence (TTT​TAT​TAT​TTA​TTT​ATA​ATT​TAT​TTT​TAT​TTT​TAG​AGA​TGT​GTC​TTG​C). Through modeling and protein-DNA docking simulations, we obtained the three-dimensional structure of the AhR-NR4A1 complex. The docking score and confidence score of AhR-NR4A1 were −219.22 and 0.7997, respectively, suggesting a high probability of binding between the two molecules ( Figure 6H Figure 6I qPCR findings demonstrated that, relative to the control group, there was a significant reduction in NR4A1 mRNA expression and intestinal barrier protein mRNA levels, including ZO-1, Claudin4, and Occludin, in the model group. Treatment with Rhy significantly upregulated NR4A1 mRNA expression and the mRNA levels of intestinal barrier proteins ZO-1, Claudin4, and Occludin in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 6J Figure 6K 4 Discussion In this study, we demonstrated that Rhynchophylline (Rhy) not only exhibits anti-inflammatory effects but also promotes intestinal health by enhancing barrier function. Our findings further confirm that Rhy activates the AhR-NR4A1 signaling pathway, which enhances the expression of tight junction proteins and suppresses inflammatory responses. Additionally, Rhy has shown significant efficacy in both the prevention and treatment of colitis. Rhy, a bioactive alkaloid extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Uncaria rhynchophylla, possesses pharmacological activities such as calcium channel blocking, anti-inflammatory effects, antihypertensive properties, and ischemic protection ( Kaneko et al., 2020 Zhou and Zhou, 2010 Wastag et al., 2022 Rhy mediates the upregulation of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1, Claudin4, and Occludin, providing protection against the “leaky gut” phenotype induced by LPS in colonic epithelia, thus playing a crucial role in regulating intestinal barrier function. The intestinal barrier comprises colonic epithelial cells and the connections between these cells, including gap junctions, adherens junctions, and tight junctions, which collectively function to seal intercellular spaces ( Li et al., 2022 Vindigni et al., 2016 Chen et al., 2021 Peng et al., 2023 Camilleri et al., 2012 Mehandru and Colombel, 2021 Kuo et al., 2019 Wei et al., 2021 Di Vincenzo et al., 2024 RNA-seq analysis revealed that Rhy not only enhances the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1, Claudin4, and Occludin in colonic epithelial cells but also upregulates the expression of Cyp1A1. Given that Cyp1A1 is a liver enzyme involved in Phase I drug metabolism and a downstream gene of AhR ( AHR, 2024 Sondermann et al., 2023 Alhamad et al., 2022 Singh et al., 2011 Lee et al., 2011 Swigonska et al., 2023 El-Dairi et al., 2020 MiR-124a Mediates the Impairment, 2024 Benson and Shepherd, 2011 What is Interesting is that Rhy failed to induce the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin4 proteins in AhR-knockdown cells. Previous reports have indicated that overexpression of Cyp1A1 in mice leads to a reduction in AhR ligands, resulting in decreased AhR activity, a form of negative feedback regulation ( Stockinger et al., 2021 Wang et al., 2010 Liu et al., 2023 Rhy is unable to exert its activity in cells with knocked-down AhR, indicating that the AhR pathway plays a crucial role in mediating Rhy’s effects. While previous studies have confirmed the role of AhR in regulating immune cell functions ( The aryl hydrocarbon receptor, 2024 Gao et al., 2018 Pulakazhi Venu et al., 2021 Guo et al., 2021 Deng et al., 2022 Liu et al., 2019 Wu et al., 2016 Safe et al., 2023 in vitro in vivo Animal studies have demonstrated that Rhy treatment significantly enhances tight junction proteins, reduces intestinal permeability, and diminishes local and systemic inflammation, thus alleviating symptoms of colitis. A dosage of 2 mg kg -1 Rhy was unable to upregulate the expression of DSS-induced intestinal barrier proteins ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin4 in cells with knocked-down AhR or NR4A1, indicating that the AhR-NR4A1 pathway mediates Rhy’s activities in repairing the intestinal barrier and its anti-inflammatory effects. Rhy may exert its anti-colitis effects through two mechanisms. Firstly, Rhy acts directly on immune cells, such as macrophages, to prevent inflammation induced by LPS or bacteria, and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity through the AhR-NR4A1 pathway. Most importantly, Rhy directly affects intestinal epithelium and barrier function by upregulating tight junction proteins. Enhanced barrier function can reduce bacterial leakage within the intestine, thereby significantly reducing systemic inflammation. RNA-Seq pathway analysis indicates that Rhy could also be crucial in inducing the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated a close connection between the Hedgehog signaling pathway and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ( Buongusto et al., 2017 Eriodictyol attenuates dextran sodium sulphate, 2024 Bouwman et al., 2022 Lees et al., 2008 5 Conclusion This research summarizes how Rhy alleviates IBD by improving the function of intestinal barrier and reducing inflammation. Current IBD treatments focus on suppressing inflammation, but enhancing intestinal barrier function might be a more effective therapeutic approach. In conclusion, Rhy has shown positive effects in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its potential clinical applications may extend beyond this condition. Rhy could also be beneficial for other diseases caused by barrier dysfunction and inflammation, such as alcoholic liver disease, neurological disorders, and colon cancer. These findings underscore Rhy’s potential therapeutic role across multiple disease contexts, highlighting its significant translational relevance.
