Introduction Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) is a transmethylation enzyme involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous amines, playing a vital role in modulating neurotransmitter activity, maintaining chemical homeostasis, and regulating psychoactive compounds. It catalyzes the methylation of nitrogenous molecules, especially indoles, where it transfers one or more methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) [ 1 2 This review not only consolidates current knowledge on INMT, but also offers a novel perspective by providing a comprehensive synthesis of INMT’s structure, function, disease associations, inhibitors, and analytical assessment. By highlighting its emerging roles in neuropsychiatry, oncology, and neurotransmitter metabolism, we address a significant gap in the literature where INMT remains underexplored as a therapeutic target and biomarker. We also evaluate the utility of existing analytical tools and inhibitor scaffolds, offering a unique and timely framework for future research and drug development. 1.1. History and Discovery of INMT In 1961, INMT was first discovered, where Axelrod (1961) reported the presence of an enzyme that can methylate indole amines, such as serotonin and tryptamine, to produce N-methylated psychomimetic metabolites [ 3 4 3 5 1.2. Substrates and Physiological Relevance INMT has a broad substrate specificity and can methylate an array of nitrogenous compounds, such as serotonin, tryptamine, and phenylethylamines, along with other indole-containing compounds [ 6 7 6 8 9 1.3. INMT in Neuropsychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders Alterations in INMT expression and/or activity have been correlated with neurological conditions and psychotic disorders [ 6 10 7 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 1.4. INMT in Cancer According to several studies, dysregulated INMT expression has been implicated in the development and progression of several human cancers [ 17 18 19 Section 3.5 1.5. Enzyme Inhibitors and Regulation Due to its involvement in various disease conditions, INMT represents a promising, overlooked target that could provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, targeting INMT may potentially offer an alternative therapeutic strategy for a range of illnesses, such as cancer, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Because of the above-mentioned points, researchers explored INMT inhibitors aiming to modulate its activity and regulate conditions resulting from altered methylation processes. Both exogenous and endogenous inhibitors of INMT have been previously reported. Regarding endogenous inhibitors, DMT [ 1 20 21 Synthetic inhibitors, such as propyl dimethyl amino tryptamine (PDAT) [ 7 22 1.6. Analytical Approaches for INMT Activity Assessment The measurement of INMT enzyme activity has been reported several times in the literature. It mainly relies on the radiochemical reaction utilizing 14 1 7 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2. INMT Characterization and Distribution The INMT is a transmethylation enzyme that was first isolated from rabbit lungs [ 3 Figure 1 6 7 30 2.1. Cloning and Genomic Characterization of INMT Cloning and expression of INMT cDNA and INMT genes were performed in both rabbit and human models, revealing a 792-base pair open reading frame encoding a 263-amino acid protein [ 1 5 5 19 30 5 2.2. Protein Structure and Active Site of INMT The hINMT protein consists of 263 amino acids and has an apparent molecular weight of 29.29 kDa. The three-dimensional crystal structure of hINMT was reported by Wu et al. [ 31 32 To highlight the role of INMT’s active-site residues in stabilizing substrate binding and to gain structural insight into substrate recognition, SAH was docked into the crystal structure of the enzyme, which consists of twenty crucial amino acids (PDB ID: 2A14) ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Despite the limited research on INMT’s binding pocket and key residues involved in substrate interactions, Thompson et al. utilized an experimentally informed computational model approach to characterize the rabbit INMT (rINMT) binding pocket. Subsequently, they confirmed it to be fully conserved in human INMT (hINMT) [ 33 Another study investigated the structural features of human recombinant INMT that contribute to its methyltransferase activity [ 30 30 2.3. Comparative Structural Features Across Species Comparative modeling between Bufo INMT (BINMT) and human INMT (hINMT) identified 17 conserved residues within the SAM-binding pocket, supporting conservation of the catalytic region [ 32 32 5 Figure 3 2.4. Tissue Distribution and Functional Activity of INMT In humans, multiple tissues have shown significant mRNA and protein expression of hINMT [ 25 34 5 5 35 32 32 Rabbit INMT (rINMT) was the first to be cloned and characterized, paving the way for the identification of hINMT [ 5 1 5 In rodents, an in vivo microdialysis study detected DMT in the dialysate samples obtained from the pineal gland and cortex of rats [ 36 37 The widespread expression of INMT in both peripheral and central tissues suggests a potential role in disease. For instance, its localization in the pineal gland links it to autism [ 38 11 39 14 40 Collectively, the diverse tissue distribution of INMT provides a mechanistic rationale for its emerging associations with neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer, and neurodegeneration, which will be discussed in the following section. 3. INMT and Related Disorders Several studies discussed the role of INMT activity and its metabolite DMT in some medical disorders, including schizophrenia and stress-related psychoses [ 12 13 14 17 17 18 19 Figure 4 3.1. Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a complex and heterogeneous mental disorder, characterized by a combination of signs and symptoms including cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions. Approximately 1% of the worldwide population suffers from schizophrenia, and it represents a median lifetime morbid risk of less than 1% [ 41 42 43 44 41 43 45 The transmethylation hypothesis [ 11 4 Dysregulation in the enzymatic activity of INMT results in elevated levels of methylated indole alkylamines, including DMT and its psychoactive analogs, such as 5-hydroxy-DMT (bufotenine) and 5-methoxy-DMT, in individuals with schizophrenia [ 4 13 46 47 5 48 49 11 50 51 DMT has been proposed to act as a neurotransmitter, with serotonin transporters (SERT) on the neuronal plasma membrane facilitating its uptake. Subsequently, DMT is stored in synaptic vesicles by vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) for release at receptor sites [ 52 53 54 55 12 56 13 Previous studies demonstrated an increase in INMT activity in patients suffering from schizophrenia. A study conducted by Wyatt et al. measured the activity of INMT in platelets of schizophrenic patients in comparison to normal subjects, using NMT and radiolabeled 14 p p 6 10 INMT can also catalyze the conversion of 5-HT into psychomimetic 5-OH-DMT [ 2 p 14 57 58 It is important to note that many of the early studies investigating DMT levels in psychiatric patients had limitations. These included outdated analytical methods, small sample sizes, and the rapid metabolism of DMT by liver monoamine oxidases (MAOs), which affected the accuracy of the measurements taken from body fluids. Barker et al. reviewed 69 published studies from 1955 to 2010. The review highlighted the shortcomings of existing data and argued that direct measurement of DMT levels in bodily fluids may not be optimal to reflect its role in schizophrenia [ 59 2 60 61 62 63 64 65 Another potential implication of DMT in schizophrenia pathophysiology is its interaction with S1Rs. Sigma-1 receptors are colocalized with INMT at the postsynaptic sites of the C-terminal in motor neurons and adrenal tissues [ 34 34 15 66 67 68 3.2. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), key pathological features, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation [ 69 70 71 72 16 14 35 73 73 73 19 3.3. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and ultimately, respiratory failure [ 74 75 76 77 78 34 15 40 3.4. Autism Although the neurophysiological causes of autism remain obscure, one of the main contributing factors is the dysfunction of the pineal gland [ 38 79 80 80 81 82 It has been proposed that the dysfunction of the pineal gland increases the INMT activity, diverting tryptophan metabolism, the precursor of both melatonin and DMT, towards DMT synthesis at the expense of melatonin, leading to the declined level of melatonin commonly observed in ASD [ 79 36 83 A common feature of ASD is the abnormal neuroplasticity, which is represented by cortical overgrowth and dendritic spine dysgenesis [ 84 83 79 p p 14 3.5. Cancer 3.5.1. Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men [ 85 86 17 19 19 3.5.2. Lung Cancer To determine the molecular changes in HIV-associated lung cancer and detect related biomarkers. Biomarker screening using Affymetrix microarrays, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), and gene expression profiles were analyzed in 59 patients with HIV-associated lung cancer [ 87 39 p 17 3.5.3. Hepatocellular Carcinoma Studies have shown that the expression of INMT is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Transcriptome analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma rat models revealed reduced expression of the INMT gene and its encoding protein. Furthermore, survival analyses evinced that INMT downregulation is linked to poor prognosis in humans [ 88 89 3.5.4. Other Cancer Types INMT downregulation has been observed in other types of cancer, such as meningioma, prostate cancer, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, and is associated with poor overall survival [ 17 17 90 3.6. Hirschsprung’s Disease (HSCR) Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder that affects approximately 0.02% of newborns. It is characterized by the loss of ganglionic cells either in a segment or the entirety of the colon, leading to intestinal obstruction and other gastrointestinal-related complications [ 91 p 92 92 These findings indicate that INMT might play a role in HSCR pathogenesis and could potentially affect neural crest cell development and the severity of HSCR. Further studies are required to determine its exact function and assess its potential to be used as a diagnostic biomarker. Collectively, the disorders associated with INMT reflect the diverse yet mechanistically convergent roles of the enzyme in human pathology. Among them, schizophrenia garnered the most research attention, likely due to the compelling evidence linking INMT activity and DMT production to psychotic symptoms and serotonergic dysregulation [ 46 78 19 89 4. INMT Inhibitors Several inhibitors ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Table 1 Table 2 4.1. Endogenous Inhibitors Endogenous inhibitors of INMT include its metabolic products, which participate in a feedback mechanism to regulate enzymatic activity. DMT 1 50 Table 1 1 7 Similarly, SAH 2 Table 1 20 21 4.2. Synthetic Inhibitors Synthetic inhibitors of INMT span several structurally diverse classes, providing insights into structure–activity relationships (SAR) and mechanisms of inhibition. Propyl dimethyl amino tryptamine (PDAT) 3 7 Table 1 7 Thompson and Weinshilboum (1998) explored a series of potential inhibitors of rabbit lung INMT using the assay described above (M1, Table 1 1 4 5 6 50 7 8 9 50 1 Aliphatic diamines 10–17 23 13 14 i 23 The inhibitory activity of 2,3,4,6,7,8-Hexahydropyrrolo[l,2-a] pyrimidine (DBN) 18 Table 1 93 18 25 18 i 93 18 93 Following the discovery of DBN 18 93 22 19 50 20 50 21 50 22 50 18 50 22 Regarding monocyclic amidines ( 23–32 23 24 32 50 25–31 50 Table 2 22 Following the identification of 2-imino-3-methylthiazolidine 23 22 24 33 33 33 23 14 33 24 Inspired by the inhibitory potential of SAH 2 20 94 34 35 94 The pharmacological relevance of INMT inhibitors is underscored by their potential role in modulating pathologies where INMT level and/or activity is upregulated, particularly for psychotic disorders [ 10 17 18 3 18 34 35, 7 22 94 5 36 In summary, the inhibition of INMT is mediated by a structurally diverse set of compounds, comprising endogenous regulators, such as DMT and SAH, as well as synthetic scaffolds, including tryptamine analogs, aliphatic diamines, amidines, and SAH derivatives. These inhibitors exhibit varying potencies and inhibition mechanisms. Selectivity toward INMT related to methyltransferases has been demonstrated for key compounds such as PDAT 3 18 5. Measurement of INMT Enzyme Activity by Discontinuous Assays Detecting the INMT’s activity has been documented several times in the literature. For screening assays, the INMT enzyme is typically extracted from the tissues of rabbit lung, rat lung, and brain, or sourced from the commercially available recombinant INMT. The most commonly used discontinuous assays are illustrated in Figure 6 5.1. Radiometric Assay The assay relies on the transmethylation of a labeled methyl group from 14 25 5.2. TLC and Spray Reagent Method The reaction product (indoleamine derivatives) could be detected using spray reagents such as O-phthalaldehyde (OPT) or p-dimethylamino cinnamaldehyde (DMACA) spray reagents. The non-radiometric assay with TLC detection is a fast method to visualize the reaction product, but it lacks the resolution [ 20 95 5.3. UHPLC-MS/MS Analysis Method The INMT assay requires a method that provides a high degree of sensitivity and resolution for product identification. This can be accomplished by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Glynos et al. developed a UHPLC-MS/MS method to measure the INMT activity. The precursor, reaction product ions, and spiked deuterated internal standards were separated, identified, and quantified using a Phenomenex Kinetex C 18 25 6. Monitoring the INMT Activity Using Real-Time Assays Several methyltransferase assays designed for high-throughput screening applications are commercially available. For selecting the most convenient assay for specific research needs and the available facilities, this section highlights the key features and main differences among the available real-time assays ( Figure 7 6.1. Methyltransferase Colorimetric Assay This assay is compatible with all purified methyltransferases that utilize SAM as a methyl donor [ 28 2 2 2 2 Figure 7 6.2. Methyltransferase Fluorometric Assay In this assay ( Figure 7 2 2 29 6.3. Apta Fluor SAH Methyltransferase TR-FRET Assay A universal assay has been developed to monitor all enzymes that convert SAM to SAH, specifically designed for high-throughput screening (see Figure 7 ® 26 6.4. HTRF EPIgeneous TM The assay protocol is divided into three main steps on a white plate. First, an enzyme reaction is utilized to generate SAH. Second, the detection phase ( Figure 7 27 6.5. MTase-Glo™ Assay MTase-Glo™ bioluminescence-based assay is a universal technique used for measuring and detecting the change in the activity of protein (all classes), DNA, and RNA methyltransferases in high-throughput screening applications [ 96 97 7. Conclusions This review highlights recent research findings on INMT, focusing on its characterization, associated diseases, inhibitors, and the in vitro assay designed to measure SAM-based methyltransferase activity. INMT produces various endogenous compounds, such as DMT, NMT, and bufotenine, by catalyzing the methylation of indoleamines using SAM as a methyl donor. Additionally, methylation of certain chemical compounds, such as selenium and tellurium, serves as a detoxification pathway. The structure of human INMT (hINMT) has been elucidated, revealing the binding site and interactions with the ligand “SAH”. The human INMT gene is located on chromosome 7 and encodes a protein that exhibits variations, such as the substitution of histidine at position 46 with proline (His46Pro), an example of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which may lead to Hirschsprung’s disease. Polymorphisms could also affect DMT levels through altered methylation, which could be linked to schizophrenia. On the other hand, altered INMT expression might play a role in carcinogenesis; reduced INMT levels have been observed in lung adenocarcinoma, and INMT downregulation has been observed in prostate and liver cancers. Our current understanding of INMT’s structural properties and mechanisms remains limited, with only one crystal structure with PDB ID 2A14 available. Furthermore, the biochemical regulation and small molecule control of INMT activity are not yet understood. Detection of the endogenous level of DMT poses a great challenge because it is affected by various physiological factors, along with the report that INMT is not essential for tryptamine methylation in rats. The precise physiological role of INMT has yet to be confirmed, and no definitive relationships have been established due to incomplete characterization. The widespread expression of INMT across organs indicates its pleiotropic importance, but its specific functions remain less thoroughly investigated. Therefore, more studies are still required to understand the INMT substrate recognition mechanisms. Comprehensive investigations should be considered to correlate INMT expression with different disorders and its contribution to metabolism. Ultimately, investigating other biological activities of INMT inhibitors could provide helpful insights into INMT’s true function and will enhance drug development and lead to more effective therapies.
