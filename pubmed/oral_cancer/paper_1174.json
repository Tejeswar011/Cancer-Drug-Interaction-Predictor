Introduction Membrane-enclosed particles, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), are ubiquitously present in organisms, including animals, plants, and microorganisms [ 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 4 5 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 The use of EXs as a delivery strategy for therapeutic cargo has become increasingly popular, in part, because they overcome many of the challenges encountered by other approaches. EXs exhibit a high degree of stability and biocompatibility with minimal immunogenicity [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 12 16 2. Recent Developments in the Use of Extracellular Vesicles and Exosomes as Therapeutic Delivery Systems 2.1. Genetic Engineering of EXs Genetic engineering has been used to modify exosomal surface proteins to better target EXs to tissues and cell types of interest, since even slight variations in exosomal tetraspanin complexes have a significant impact on target cell selection. Transfecting genes expressing a targeting moiety with exosomal membrane components is one method of genetically altering EX-producing cells. Through the natural EX biogenesis process, the cells transfected with these vectors produce surface-modified EXs that express the targeting moieties. EXs produced from genetically engineered cells stably display the introduced targeting moiety on their surface [ 17 18 18 19 19 2.2. Chemical Modifications of EXs To make therapeutic EXs more targetable, their surface can be directly engineered through chemical modifications. One such approach is click chemistry. Click chemistry utilizes covalent interactions between an alkyne and an azide residue to form a stable triazole linkage, which can be applied to attach targeting moieties on the surface of EXs [ 20 21 22 22 23 23 2.3. Combinatorial Approaches Hybrid Nanoparticles As an alternative to genetic engineering of parent cells or EXs and chemical modification of EXs, targeting ligands conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been used to produce EXs in which the targeting ligand is expressed in the exosomal membrane. For example, nanobodies specific for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), upregulated in a variety of solid tumors, were conjugated to phospholipid-PEG derivatives to produce nanobody-PEG-micelles [ 24 24 Diacyl-chain phospholipids self-assemble in aqueous solutions to form spherical vesicles called liposomes [ 25 26 27 26 In a fascinating study, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) EXs and gelatine nanoparticle (GNP) hydrogel combined to form a stable meshwork because of the opposing charges of the two substances. In a rat skull defect model, the skull bone formation produced by the GNP hydrogel-ADSC EX mixture was substantially greater than that of the GNP- and sham-treated groups [ 28 Liu and colleagues [ 29 SNCA 29 2.4. Large-Scale EX Production Approaches The quality and quantity of secreted EXs are reduced in conventional two-dimensional, static cultures, as these cultures cannot replicate the in vivo environment, including fluidic stimuli [ 30 31 31 Contrary to conventional, static cell culture conditions, a flat-plate bioreactor was used to increase EX production. The chamber in the flat-plate bioreactor was seeded with cells. The culture medium was delivered to the chamber via a peristaltic pump, which produced laminar flow conditions. The flow introduced shear stress to the cells, which opened calcium channels, leading to increased calcium influx [ 32 33 32 2.5. Milk and Plant EXs Milk- and plant-derived EXs have gained popularity recently despite advancements in the mass production of EXs derived from cultured cells. Milk is a particularly dense source of EXs, with concentrations in milk exceeding 10 12 34 35 36 37 38 Similar to milk-derived EXs, plant-derived EXs represent a potentially rich source of useful EXs. Plant-derived EXs are thought to be used as a means of intercellular communication and immune regulation to protect plants from pathogenic attacks [ 39 40 41 42 43 44 42 45 3. Contributions to This Special Issue In this Special Issue, Mecocci and colleagues [ 46 Escherichia coli 47 48 49 49 50 50 51 51 52 53 54 55 4. Future Research High production costs, a high level of technical expertise, and challenges differentiating genetically engineered EXs from naturally occurring EXs in biological fluids are some of the drawbacks of genetically engineered EXs, despite their many benefits such as improved targeting precision, effective therapeutic delivery, and decreased off-target effects. Further research and optimization are needed to make them more feasible for clinical applications. Chemically modified EXs offer several advantages, including enhanced targeting, versatility, retention of the natural properties of the EXs, and the ability to cross biological barriers. The technical difficulties of both covalent and non-covalent EX modifications, the possible loss of native protein function in the EX membrane, and the difficulty in scaling up chemical modification techniques to large-scale production are the drawbacks of chemical modification of EXs. Future studies should focus on addressing these issues. Potential disruption of the exosomal membrane during production, the possibility of an immunological reaction, and regulatory ambiguity surrounding their classification—which makes approval more difficult—are some of the difficulties with hybrid nanoparticles. Clear regulatory frameworks, scalable production methods, and improved engineering techniques are essential to tackle these challenges. Future developments in isolation technologies, engineering methods, and standardization protocols are required to enable scalable EX production for clinical applications, even though recent advancements in the large-scale production of EXs, such as the use of microfluidic chips and bioreactors, are encouraging. Despite the fact that milk EXs are non-immunologic oral delivery vehicles for a range of therapeutic substances, a major obstacle is the transfer of isolation techniques from the laboratory to the industrial production process. In addition, there are no detailed pharmacokinetic studies, and the complex composition of milk makes it difficult to isolate high-purity milk EXs. To address these issues, improvements in isolation techniques, scalable production methods, and thorough safety and efficacy studies are needed. Despite the fact that plant EXs are safe [ 42 45 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Institutional Review Board Statement Not applicable. Informed Consent Statement Not applicable.
