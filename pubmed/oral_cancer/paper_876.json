Introduction Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects an estimated 58 million individuals worldwide and remains a major global health burden. Without treatment, progressive hepatic inflammation can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), conditions that drive most liver-related morbidity and mortality [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Although sustained virologic response (SVR) markedly reduces HCC risk, it does not eliminate it, especially in individuals with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [ 7 8 9 10 11 We, therefore, aimed to (i) evaluate longitudinal changes in hepatic function and fibrosis indices in patients with chronic HCV infection who received glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and achieved SVR, and (ii) identify factors associated with incident HCC after SVR. The findings will inform risk-stratified surveillance and optimize post-SVR management. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Population This prospective, multicenter observational cohort enrolled patients from six university-affiliated tertiary hospitals in South Korea between July 2018 and December 2024. Eligible participants were adults (≥18 years) with chronic hepatitis C who received glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and achieved SVR, defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after treatment completion ( Supplementary Figure S1 Cirrhosis was diagnosed using a composite assessment that integrated histopathology, imaging features (nodular liver surface, splenomegaly, ascites, or esophagogastric varices), and clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation. The albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade, an objective index derived from serum albumin and total bilirubin, was used to quantify hepatic reserve; patients were categorized as grade 1, 2, or 3 using established thresholds [ 12 ® . Table 1 9 9 10 ® The composite primary outcome was the first occurrence of HCC or all-cause mortality. Baseline portal hypertension was defined by ascites, esophagogastric varices, or hepatic encephalopathy. Participants underwent semiannual or annual assessments, including laboratory tests (liver biochemistry, serum HCV RNA, and alpha-fetoprotein) and imaging studies (abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography), to track disease progression and identify incident malignancies. 2.2. Statistical Analysis Baseline demographic and clinical variables were summarized descriptively. Continuous data are reported as medians (interquartile range), and categorical data as numbers (percentage). Between-group comparisons employed the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables and the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, as appropriate. Temporal changes in hepatic biochemical markers and noninvasive fibrosis scores (APRI, FIB-4) were examined with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The cumulative incidence of HCC was depicted by Kaplan–Meier curves and compared with the log-rank test. Factors associated with HCC development were investigated using Cox proportional hazards models; variables with p p Longitudinal trajectories of liver function indices (CTP, MELD, APRI, and FIB-4) were evaluated with linear regression models for repeated measures. Time was treated as categorical (baseline, SVR, and annually to year 5). At each time point, cross-sectional differences between patients with and without HCC were assessed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Adjusted marginal means and 95% confidence intervals were generated with the margins command in Stata/SE version 16, and trajectories were visualized with marginsplot. 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics Of the 395 patients who attained SVR, 16 (4.1%) developed HCC during a median follow-up of 31.1 months. Baseline characteristics stratified by HCC status are summarized in Table 1 p Compared with non-HCC patients, those who developed HCC had lower platelet counts (115.1 ± 53.9 vs. 187.7 ± 65.0 × 10 9 p p p p p p p p Supplementary Figure S2 3.2. Longitudinal Changes in Liver Function after Antiviral Treatment To evaluate longitudinal liver function changes, Child–Pugh and MELD scores were calculated at predefined intervals after SVRs ( Table 2 Figure 1 When stratified by subsequent HCC development, Child–Pugh and MELD scores remained stable within each subgroup over the 5-year period ( Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Figure S3 3.3. Longitudinal Changes in Liver Fibrosis after Antiviral Treatment Fibrosis was assessed by APRI, FIB-4, and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in the same 395 patients ( Table 3 p p When stratified by HCC occurrence, APRI and FIB-4 decreased similarly from baseline to SVR in both subgroups and remained low thereafter ( Supplementary Table S2 3.4. Risk Factors for Hepatocellular Carcinoma After SVR To explore predictors of post-SVR HCC after glecaprevir/pibrentasvir therapy, univariate and multivariate Cox models were fitted ( Table 4 p p p p p p p p Based on the multivariable analysis of risk factors for HCC development, namely FIB-4 > 3.25 at SVR and MELD score ≥ 10, patients were stratified into the following three cohorts, as shown in Figure 2 4. Discussion Achieving SVR with direct-acting antivirals has markedly reduced the global burden of HCV-related liver disease. Nevertheless, HCC remains a salient long-term complication, especially among patients with pre-existing fibrosis or functional impairment at the time of viral clearance. In our prospective multicenter cohort, 4.1% of participants developed HCC despite successful glecaprevir/pibrentasvir therapy. Noninvasive fibrosis (FIB-4 > 3.25) and hepatic dysfunction (MELD ≥ 10) measured at SVR independently predicted subsequent HCC. These observations imply that hepatocarcinogenesis can persist after virologic cure, mandating vigilant long-term surveillance of high-risk individuals. Our findings align with reports showing that HCC risk persists after SVR, especially in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [ 8 13 14 15 9 16 Unlike earlier cirrhosis-only studies, our cohort spanned the full spectrum of liver disease, broadening applicability. Residual hepatic injury—reflected by elevated FIB-4 and MELD scores—remains a critical determinant of long-term oncologic risk, irrespective of cirrhosis status. Among the predictors, FIB-4 > 3.25 emerged as the most robust. FIB-4, which integrates age, aminotransferase levels, and platelet count, is a validated surrogate for hepatic fibrosis [ 17 18 Likewise, MELD ≥ 10 independently predicted HCC, underscoring the prognostic weight of residual dysfunction despite viral clearance [ 19 20 21 22 The persistence of HCC risk after SVR may be partly explained by pathophysiologic processes that remain active beyond viral eradication. Chronic HCV infection induces epigenetic modifications, clonal hepatocyte expansion, and oxidative stress, all of which may sustain oncogenic signaling despite resolution of inflammation [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 This study has several important limitations. First, although patients were followed prospectively, the observational design precludes causal inference between residual hepatic injury and post-SVR HCC. Additionally, unmeasured metabolic, environmental, or genetic factors may have influenced the observed associations. For example, we did not assess the use of antifibrotic co-medications (e.g., statins, antidiabetic agents) or implement lifestyle interventions such as weight-loss counseling or alcohol cessation support, all of which may impact fibrosis regression and HCC risk. Second, although FIB-4 and MELD are noninvasive surrogates of fibrosis and hepatic reserve, they cannot fully capture disease complexity without histology or elastography. Third, the follow-up period captured early but not necessarily late HCC cases, especially in lower-risk groups, underscoring the need for longer surveillance. While the median follow-up was 31 months, HCC occurred at a median of 24 months among affected individuals, and the Kaplan–Meier analysis was extended to 60 months to provide a clearer view of long-term trends. However, since many post-DAA HCC cases may develop after three years, especially in patients with concomitant liver diseases, the current follow-up may not fully capture the long-term risk. Longer follow-up in future studies will be important to confirm these findings and identify delayed HCC cases. Nonetheless, the prospective multicenter design and broad disease spectrum strengthen the study, and the reliance on widely available markers (FIB-4 and MELD) supports their practical value for long-term risk stratification. 5. Conclusions This prospective, multicenter analysis shows that, even after sustained SVR with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, patients with advanced fibrosis or reduced hepatic reserves remain at risk for HCC. FIB-4 > 3.25 and MELD ≥ 10 at SVR independently predicted tumor development. Because both scores are inexpensive and routinely obtained, and their combined application offers a feasible framework for post-SVR surveillance. Longer follow-up and novel biomarkers are needed to refine risk prediction post-DAA.
