Introduction Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory muscles, and associated structures. They are commonly characterized by orofacial pain, restricted mandibular function, joint sounds, and reduced quality of life [ 1 2 3 The etiology of TMDs is multifactorial, encompassing biomechanical, traumatic, psychological, and occlusal factors [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Therefore, there is a growing need in clinical and research settings for alternative diagnostic tools that are more time-efficient, user-friendly, and easier to implement [ 11 12 13 Simplified indices have been proposed to improve efficiency without compromising diagnostic accuracy [ 11 12 13 14 14 15 16 14 14 15 15 The present study provides a rigorous clinical validation of the mHI in a Romanian patient cohort, directly comparing its diagnostic performance and reliability with the DC/TMD protocol. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the mHI against the DC/TMD in this population while also quantifying application time. By combining accuracy metrics with feasibility assessment, we highlight the potential of the mHI as a simple, reliable, and time-efficient tool for both clinical practice and population-level screening. 2. Materials and Methods This study was designed as a cross-sectional clinical validation for the diagnostic validity and reliability of the modified Helkimo Index (mHI) in temporomandibular disorders (TMD). The Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) served as the gold-standard method for reference comparison. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was used to evaluate the correlation between clinical findings and patients’ perceived pain intensity. 2.1. Ethical Considerations The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of “Dunărea de Jos” University of Galați, Romania (Approval No. CEU/16, 9 December 2024). All clinical assessments were conducted within the Department of Pediatric and Adult Dentistry at the County Clinical Emergency Hospital in Galați. Ethical approval was obtained from the Hospital’s Ethics Committee and the University Ethics Board. Before enrollment, all participants provided written informed consent after receiving comprehensive information regarding the study objectives, procedures involved, potential benefits, and possible risks associated with participation. 2.2. Participants 164 participants recruited from the Department of Pediatric and Adult Dentistry at the County Clinical Emergency Hospital in Romania between January and April 2025 were included in the study. A priori sample size calculation was conducted to ensure adequate statistical power. Based on an expected effect size of d = 0.5, α = 0.05, and power = 0.80, a minimum of 128 participants was required. Our final sample of 164 (82 per group) exceeded this threshold, ensuring sufficient precision for validity and reliability analyses. Eligible participants were between 18 and 45 years of age. - The sample was divided into two distinct groups: TMD Group: 82 patients diagnosed with temporomandibular disorders based on the DC/TMD protocol. Diagnoses were established independently by two calibrated examiners who underwent formal training sessions before the study, including consensus-building exercises and supervised pilot cases to ensure standardization and reproducibility. - Control Group: 82 healthy individuals with no clinical signs or symptoms of TMD, as determined through clinical evaluation and a structured screening questionnaire. Controls were age- and sex-matched to the TMD group. 2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria: - Age ≥ 18 years; - Willingness to participate in all scheduled evaluations; - Provision of written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria: - History of craniofacial surgery or trauma; - Ongoing orthodontic treatment; - Known TMJ pathologies (e.g., neoplasms); - Severe systemic diseases affecting TMJ function (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis); - Recent use of medications altering TMD perception (e.g., analgesics, muscle relaxants); - Declined consent. Although bruxism, psychological stress, and depression are recognized contributors to TMD, they were not used as exclusion criteria to preserve ecological validity and reflect the clinical heterogeneity typically encountered in practice. These factors were not directly measured in the present study; however, their potential influence was minimized by (i) matching groups for age and sex, (ii) applying standardized diagnostic protocols, and (iii) using statistical models (GEE) to adjust for confounders. Future studies incorporating validated psychosocial assessments are recommended to explore their interaction with diagnostic outcomes. 2.4. Clinical Measurement Methodology The diagnostic validity of the modified Helkimo Index (mHI) was assessed against the DC/TMD protocol within the framework of a structured Validation Project. Reference diagnoses were established by consensus between two independent TMD specialists. The DC/TMD protocol served as the gold-standard diagnostic method for confirming the presence of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) [ 7 The DC/TMD clinical examination protocol includes 12 core items [ 7 16 17 Subjective pain perception was evaluated using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), a widely accepted tool for clinical pain assessment. Participants were asked to rate their perceived discomfort on a numerical scale from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates the complete absence of pain and 10 represents the most intense pain imaginable. This approach provides standardized and comparable data regarding the severity of painful symptoms. NPRS is valued for its ease of use, patient comprehensibility, and validated applicability across diverse clinical contexts [ 18 Pain scores were interpreted as follows: - 0: No pain - 1–3: Mild pain - 4–6: Moderate pain - 7–10: Severe pain This classification offers clinicians valuable insight into symptom severity and its potential impact on patients’ daily activities [ 19 20 NPRS was used to assess pain intensity in two anatomical regions relevant to TMD pathology: the cervical region and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The selection of this tool allowed for precise quantification of pain in both areas. Moreover, it facilitated monitoring of symptom progression during the observation period and supported the effectiveness of any therapeutic interventions. This multidimensional approach offered a detailed perspective on the musculoskeletal impact of pain among participants. The modified Helkimo Index (mHI) represents a clinically updated refinement of the original Helkimo Index introduced by Martti Helkimo in 1974. Building on the initial framework, subsequent revisions, most notably those proposed by Maglione et al., introduced improved scoring scales, refined pain assessment criteria, and standardized reproducibility protocols, addressing earlier concerns regarding construct validity and enhancing diagnostic applicability. As Table 1 Table 2 15 The scores obtained by applying the clinical criteria from Table 1 Table 2 2.5. Classification of TMD Severity Table 2 15 2.6. Statistical Analysis For continuous variables, Welch’s t Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.2, employing the following packages: - tidyverse for data cleaning and manipulation; - stats and psych for inferential testing and effect size estimation; - irr for reliability coefficients; - pROC for ROC curve analysis and AUC comparisons. Key results were cross-validated using IBM SPSS Statistics version 27. The normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared between groups using the Welch’s t 2 Effect sizes were quantified using: - Cohen’s d for continuous parametric comparisons; - r for nonparametric comparisons; - Φ coefficient (phi) for categorical variables. Inter- and intra-examiner reliability for Helkimo scores was assessed using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), model 2.1, based on absolute agreement, and Cohen’s kappa (κ) for item-level agreement. Confidence intervals (95%) were calculated using bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations). Interpretation thresholds followed the guidelines by Koo and Li [ 21 - ICC < 0.50 = poor - 0.50–0.75 = moderate - 0.75–0.90 = good - 0.90 = excellent. The linear correlation between mHI and DC/TMD scores was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Correlation strength was interpreted according to Evans, where r ≥ 0.80 denotes a strong association. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for both diagnostic instruments. Area under the Curve (AUC) values were compared using DeLong’s test. The optimal cutoff point was determined using the Youden Index (J = Sensitivity + Specificity − 1). For the identified thresholds, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) , Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with a logit link and exchangeable correlation structure were applied to account for intra-group dependency and adjust for confounding variables such as age and sex. The study was conducted in accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for observational studies and the STARD 2015 (Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) checklist. The completed checklists are provided as Supplementary Materials File S1 3. Results A total of 212 individuals were initially contacted for potential inclusion. After applying the eligibility criteria and accounting for refusals, 164 participants were enrolled. Of these, 82 were clinically diagnosed with TMD and 82 were healthy controls. Forty-eight individuals were excluded due to non-eligibility or refusal. Participant demographics are summarized in Table 3 The mean age was slightly lower in the TMD group (28.0 ± 6.0 years) compared with controls (31.0 ± 6.5 years; p p p p Possible explanations may include repetitive microtrauma, muscular overuse, and psychosocial stress associated with competitive activity. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution. Confounding factors such as training intensity, bruxism, and unmeasured psychological stress may contribute to this association. Further targeted studies are warranted to clarify the causal relationship between athletic activity and TMD risk. As expected, mean Helkimo scores were substantially higher in the TMD group (13.2 ± 4.8) versus controls (1.8 ± 1.6; p Table 4 p Reliability indicators confirmed the strong reproducibility of the mHI. Inter-examiner reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.87), and intra-examiner repeatability after 7 days was even higher (ICC = 0.91). Item-level κ was 0.65, indicating good-to-very good agreement. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves comparing the diagnostic performance of the modified Helkimo Index (mHI) and the DC/TMD protocol in detecting temporomandibular disorders (TMD) ( Figure 1 Mean reliability coefficients (ICC/κ) with 95% confidence intervals for the modified Helkimo Index across three domains: inter-examiner agreement, intra-examiner repeatability, and item-level concordance.

In the comparative accuracy plot ( Figure 3 Table 6 p The logarithmic curve ( Figure 4 + − + − + − 4. Discussion The primary objective of this study was to validate the modified Helkimo Index (mHI) for the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in a Romanian patient cohort, using the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) as the reference standard. Our results indicate that the mHI is a reliable and time-efficient clinical instrument, demonstrating diagnostic performance comparable to that of the DC/TMD protocol. The mHI may serve as a practical tool for initial patient triage and assessment, particularly in resource-limited clinical settings or during large-scale population screening programs. These findings provide strong evidence supporting the accuracy and reproducibility of this simplified clinical tool, highlighting its potential for integration into routine practice where full DC/TMD implementation may be logistically challenging. This makes it a valuable alternative for initial patient triage and assessment, particularly in outpatient dental clinics where the full DC/TMD protocol may be logistically challenging or impractical due to time constraints. The demographic analysis ( Table 3 p 13 p 22 We also found a significant association between athletic activity and TMD, with a higher proportion of TMD patients being athletes (60%) compared to healthy controls (48%). This finding aligns with studies by Crincoli et al. and Freiwald et al. [ 23 24 24 In addition, our study identified a significantly higher prevalence of TMD among individuals residing in rural areas (60%) compared to those in urban areas (40%), with statistical significance ( p 3 p 25 From a diagnostic performance perspective, the modified Helkimo Index demonstrated a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 84%, values closely aligned with those of the DC/TMD protocol (sensitivity 91%, specificity 93%). This similarity confirms the mHI’s capacity to discriminate between patients with and without TMD. The strong correlation between mHI and DC/TMD scores (r = 0.83) further validates the mHI as a reliable clinical alternative. In support of these results, Alonso-Royo et al. [ 17 The area under the curve (AUC) for the mHI was 0.89, confirming its excellent ability to differentiate between TMD and non-TMD cases, a performance that slightly exceeds some previously reported values for the Helkimo score, where the AUC ranged from 0.84 to 0.87 [ 2 17 The optimal cutoff point identified (≥9 points), along with positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios, supports the validity of the mHI as a reliable, rapid, and effective clinical screening tool for TMD, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Our results regarding the reproducibility of the mHI revealed excellent consistency, with an inter-examiner intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.87 and an intra-examiner ICC of 0.91, surpassing conventional thresholds for reliability. These values align with findings by Alonso Royo et al. [ 17 17 Multivariate analysis using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) highlighted a strong predictive relationship between mHI scores and the likelihood of a positive TMD diagnosis. Every additional point on the Helkimo Index was associated with a 45% increase in adjusted odds. This significant predictive association confirms the internal validity of the mHI. Moreover, the absence of independent effects of age or sex emphasizes the index’s symptom-specific nature, indicating that it accurately reflects dysfunction severity regardless of demographic variables. These findings are consistent with those of Yarasca-Berrocal et al. [ 15 The optimal administration time of a clinical tool is essential for its efficient implementation in dental outpatient settings. Our findings show that the mHI can be completed in 5–10 min, substantially less than the 16–20 min required for the full DC/TMD protocol. This time difference is critical, as it reduces both patient burden and examination duration without compromising diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, validation studies, including Alonso Royo et al. [ 17 26 27 Beyond the Romanian context, several studies worldwide have applied or validated the modified Helkimo Index, underscoring its broader clinical relevance. For example, Alonso-Royo et al. (Spain) validated the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction Index for TMD diagnosis [ 17 15 14 23 4.1. Strengths and Limitations This study presents a rigorous clinical validation of the modified Helkimo Index (mHI) in a Romanian patient sample, using the DC/TMD protocol as the reference standard. The sample size was sufficient to support robust statistical analyses, and the comparison groups were carefully selected to ensure demographic comparability. The mHI demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance, with 86% sensitivity, 84% specificity, and a strong correlation (r = 0.83) with DC/TMD scores. Reliability analyses revealed excellent inter- and intra-examiner agreement (ICC = 0.87 and 0.91, respectively), confirming the tool’s stability and reproducibility. In addition, its short administration time (5–10 min) offers a significant operational advantage over more complex protocols, supporting its use in clinical environments with limited resources. Nonetheless, several limitations must be acknowledged. Although the sample size was adequate for statistical analysis, the recruitment of participants from a single hospital and within a relatively homogenous age group restricts the external validity of the findings. Moreover, the study was conducted in a specialized clinical setting in Romania, which may limit the applicability of the results to broader populations and routine dental practice. Psychosocial variables such as bruxism, stress, and anxiety were not directly assessed and may act as unmeasured confounders influencing temporomandibular disorder expression. To strengthen generalizability, future multi-center investigations should include more diverse socio-demographic cohorts, incorporate psychosocial risk factors, and extend validation across different clinical contexts and cultural environments. 4.2. Clinical Implications These findings have significant clinical implications. Validation of the modified Helkimo Index in a Romanian sample provides dental practitioners and researchers with a simple, fast, and effective tool for assessing temporomandibular disorders, complementing the DC/TMD protocol. Implementing this index can improve access to timely and accurate diagnoses, reducing the time and resources required while facilitating early detection and optimal management of this complex condition. 5. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the modified Helkimo Index (mHI) is a valid, reliable, and operationally efficient clinical alternative to the DC/TMD protocol for diagnosing temporomandibular disorders. Its high performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, combined with its short administration time, supports the broad implementation of the mHI in general dental practice and resource-limited settings. These results validate the mHI as a pragmatic tool with genuine potential to optimize triage and the early diagnosis of TMD in diverse clinical contexts.

Parameter Description Evaluation Scoring Scale A. Limitation of mandibular range of motion Assessment of maximum opening, lateral movements, and mandibular protrusion Direct clinical measurements  - Vertical opening: ≥40 mm—0 points (normal) 30–39 mm—1 point (mild limitation) <30 mm—5 points (severe limitation) - Lateral movements and protrusion: ≥7 mm—0 points 4–6 mm—1 point 0–3 mm—5 points B. Alterations in joint function Observation during mandibular opening/closing by palpation and auscultation Detection of joint sounds, locking, or dislocation  - No deviation or sounds—0 points - oint sounds or mandibular deviation—1 point - Locking or dislocation (with or without sounds)—5 points C. Pain during movement Self-reported pain during mandibular movements   - No pain—0 points - Pain during a single movement—1 point - Pain during two or more movements—5 points D. Muscle pain Palpation or functional manipulation of masticatory muscles Identification of painful areas  - No pain on palpation—0 points - Pain in 3 zones—1 point - Pain in 4 or more zones—5 points E. TMJ pain Palpation of the periauricular area and external auditory canal Evaluation of pain on palpation  - No spontaneous or palpation-induced pain—0 points - Pain on uni/bilateral periauricular palpation—1 point - Pain on palpation of both the external auditory canal and periauricular area—5 points diagnostics-15-02347-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Severity classification for TMD based on modified Helkimo Index.
