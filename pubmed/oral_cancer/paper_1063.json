Introduction Currently, the design and implementation of new diagnostic processes, pathogenetic treatment, and restoration of the function and aesthetics of the oral cavities of patients with personalized consideration of the rehabilitation processes are of particular importance. Zygomatic implants are a viable solution for the rehabilitation of patients with cancer, especially when bone grafting is contraindicated or inappropriate. In particular, combined metal-polymer dental structures are widely used [ 1 However, failures in rehabilitation are inevitable and are most often associated with loosening (disintegration) of implants [ 2 3 After installation, zygomatic implants are in tight contact with the bone tissue without any compensations or redistributions of loads on the periodontal ligament, which could partly absorb the loads [ 4 5 6 7 8 When solving practical problems related to the installation of four zygomatic implants after partial or full maxillectomy and subsequent attachment of a removable overdenture (ROD), computer simulation based on the finite element method (FEM) is an effective tool for treatment planning [ 9 10 11 12 Such computer simulations are motivated by the necessity to assess the maximum stresses and strains in the regions of attachment of implants to the zygomatic bones, with the possibility of adjusting the number, size, and locations of implants. One of the reasons for this ambiguity is the different conditions (density) of the bone tissue in the potential installation region of each implant chosen by a surgeon [ 13 14 In the context of planning prosthetic treatment with the installation of implants, the SSSs of bone tissue should be analyzed, primarily in the regions of their attachment. The authors have previously conducted similar studies [ 15 As shown in [ 16 17 18 In this study, the SSSs of the ’zygomatic bone–implant–splinting bar–ROD’ dental structure were evaluated under various loading conditions. The splinting bar serves two functional purposes: it splints all four zygomas and serves as a basis for fixing the ROD with clamps. Its application allows for the redistribution of stresses transmitted from the ROD on the one hand. On the other hand, it can cause excessive concentration of stress upon non-coaxial loading, which can result in fracture of the zygomatic bones in the implant attachment regions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 Section 3 Supplementary Files S1 and S2 2. Research and Computer Simulation Methods For computer simulation, a 3D model of the ‘zygomatic bones–implants–splinting bar–ROD’ dental structure was developed ( Figure 1 19 20 Figure 2 21 Figure 2 15 22 Figure 2 Figure 1 In this study, the splinting bar was simulated as a circular-section arch (2 mm in diameter) with four cylindrical sockets, which are rigidly fastened together at the manufacturing stage. The polymer ROD is assumed to be attached to the splinting bar using special clamps ( Figure 3 The developed model imitates bar (rod) structures used in dental treatment. The male part of the lock is a bar connecting the abutments of osseointegrated zygomatic implants. The female part is inserted and fixed into the ROD, corresponding to the shape of the splinting bar (four clamps in the studied case). The splinting bar includes a matrix (thickening) that is installed on the male (abutment) of the implants, symmetrically positioning them on both sides of the jaw. The splinting bar is attached to the implants’ abutments using titanium pins. According to specialized medical literature and manufacturers’ information, clamps for fastening a ROD should provide a given level of retention (estimated by the load level required for its removal) and stabilization. In this study, the maximum retention level of 1.8 kg (Medium Retention–Retentive yellow clip) [ 23 The main purpose of computer simulation was to estimate SSSs of the elements of the dental structure and to study the effect of redistribution of the loads transferred from the ROD to the zygomatic bones through four implants. For this reason, the clamp design was idealized in the 3D model ( Figure 3 The connection of the splinting bar with four implants was simulated by rigid contact when the possibility of frictionless slipping between the implant head surfaces and the sockets (fastening holes of the splinting bar) was excluded. These conditions reflect the tight fit of the dental structure components. The clamps for fastening the ROD to the splinting bar were excluded from this model. Instead, rigid connections were introduced as contact surfaces, attaching the ROD to the splinting bar. To consider such cases, the virtual fastener (joint) options were activated in the ‘ANSYS 19’ software package. These contact surfaces are represented by green areas in Figure 3 When assessing the structural integrity of the elements of the dental structure, a safety factor ( n (1) n = < σ > σ max , max n The minimum limit for spongy bones, which was determined experimentally depending on patient age [ 24 25 Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was selected as the material of the ROD, as it is widely used for this purpose [ 26 27 28 29 Table 1 Four titanium implants of two types were considered in the model ( Figure 4 30 30 Figure 4 In this work, the posterior implants #1 and #4 ONC–55-37.5 (37.5 mm long) were chosen to be shorter than the anterior implants #2 and #3 ZYGAN-47.5 (47.5 mm long) due to the geometry of the skull and the placement of the elements of the dental structure. During the surgery planning stage, the type of dental implant is selected by the oral surgeon, taking into account recommendations of the manufacturers. The attachment sites in the zygomatic bones are of particular importance [ 18 Some researchers have analyzed the effects of masticatory muscles on the attachment regions of the zygomatic bones [ 16 31 32 3. The Results of Computer Simulation 3.1. Evaluation of SSSs of the Dental Structure During Insertion and Removal of the ROD For the ROD, both insertion and removal processes were simulated assuming that four clamps are serially snapped (with a force of 20 N/~1.8 kg on each) and unsnapped, respectively (to the right from the retention zone, i.e., No. 1–No. 4, in accordance with the numbers shown in Figure 3 Supplementary File S1 Table S1 Figure S16 Table S1 Figure S16a Figure S16b The minimally loaded areas of the zygomatic bones, which do not lead to a critical state, are adjacent to implant No. 4 in all cases. In Figure 5 Table 1 By applying the critical stresses of the materials ( Table 1 n – 10.6 ( n – 31 ( n – 0.72 ( n – 0.86 ( n For the three cases with n Table S1 Table 1 n Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Supplementary File S2, Figures S1–S4 The data are provided for only one considered case, as the element is first mentioned in the text. All other illustrative materials concerning the same elements under other loading conditions are provided in Supplementary File S2 Based on the above, the critical (threshold) stresses exceeded only in the zygomatic bones when loading clamps No. 1 and No. 4, i.e., along the edges of the splinting bar. However, this phenomenon is observed in three of the 16 positions in the four considered cases of fixing the ROD to the splinting bar with clamps ( Figure 5 Under the conditions applied in computer simulation, it can be assumed that insertion and removal of the ROD do not give rise to fractures of the zygomatic bones in the regions of attachment of the implants. Therefore, the critical equivalent stresses in the zygomatic bones do not depend on the loading direction, namely, insertion/removal of the ROD. This is suggested to be due to the effective consolidating role of the splinting bar that redistributes the applied loads when its type (tension or compression) does not change the magnitude of stresses (in the regions of attachment of the implants to the zygomatic bones). 3.2. Determination of SSSs in the Components of the Dental Structure Under Static Loads (Mastication on Molars and Premolars) The next considered cases are characterized by loading on the posterior blocks of teeth (molars and premolars) under mastication. This process was simulated as a serial application of a load of 50 N to the ROD in positions No. 1–4 on the contact surfaces of the teeth, as shown in Figure 9 Figure 9 Note that each implant interacts with the ROD at individual attachment points through the splinting bar, to which it is attached using four clamps in the retention zones. Thus, uneven redistributions of the applied loads to the artificial teeth of the ROD may occur. This fact is confirmed by the results of the computer simulation presented below, which assesses the redistribution of reactive forces on the implants for each loading option. The calculated redistributions of reactive forces on the bases of the zygomas from the impact on the posterior blocks of the artificial teeth of the ROD in the area of contact of the heads of the zygomas and the splinting bar are presented in Table 2 Figure 4 Figure 9 Figure S17 Table 2 The results of the qualitative assessment of the stress distributions indicated that the implants perceived bending moments in all cases. However, with the specified features of the redistributions of reactive forces, one of the four zygomas experiences a bend in the opposite direction; therefore, the resulting axial load contributes to conditions for pulling or tearing out the implants from the zygomatic bones. Under mastication, the only implant, No. 3, is deformed in one direction, while the others change the sign of the resulting axial force depending on the load application site. The calculated equivalent stresses for the load redistributions under mastication are listed in Table S2 Figure S18 Table S2 Figure 10 Table 1 By applying the critical stresses of the materials ( Table 1 n – 2.4 ( n – 3.9 ( n – 14.8 ( n – 0.3 and 0.52 ( n – 0.37 and 0.5 ( n – 0.5 and 0.81 ( n – 0.65 ( n When n Figure 11 Figure 3 Some examples of the distributions of the equivalent von Mises stresses in the splinting bar, implants, and zygomatic bones under mastication are shown in Figures S5–S7 Therefore, it was shown that mastication with localized normal loading on individual posterior artificial teeth in the ROD with a force of 50 N can cause critical stresses of about 16–44 MPa in each of the four areas of attachment of the implants in the zygomatic bones. When loading teeth No. 1 and No. 2, the maximum stresses were observed at the area of attachment of implant No. 1. They are located near the upper and lower implants No. 3 and No. 4 for the same teeth in both cases. The authors suggested that this is due to the variations in both implant attachment areas and lever lengths from them to the splinting bar, contributing to the bending moments. 3.3. Calculation of SSSs in the Components of the Dental Structure Under Biting by the Incisors In a computer simulation of the biting process, a load of 50 N was serially applied to the artificial incisors of the ROD ( Figure 12 - in the positions Nos. 1–4 ( Figure 12 - and 45° according to the local coordinate system shown in Figure 12 By analogy with the above cases, the redistributions of reactive forces in the implants upon loading on the artificial incisors ( Figure 12 Table 3 Table 4 Figure S19 Figure 12 By performing a comparative analysis of the histograms presented in Figure S19 The maximum equivalent stresses in the components of the dental structure upon loading on the artificial incisors at an angle of 90° are given in Table S3 Figure S20 Figure 13 By applying the critical stresses of the materials ( Table 1 n – 6.0 ( n – 3.7 ( n – 16.3 ( n – 0.38 and 0.52 ( n – 0.86, 0.43, and 0.65 ( n – 0.56, 0.54, and 0.5 ( n – 0.81, 0.46, and 0.72 ( n When n The maximum equivalent stresses in the components of the dental structure upon loading the artificial incisors at an angle of 45° are shown in Table S4 Figure S21 Figure 14 By applying the critical stresses of the materials ( Table 1 n – 3.6 ( n – 3.0 ( n – 16.3 ( n – 0.22 in the implant attachment area No. 2 of the zygomatic bone when loading tooth No. 1. The equivalent stresses exceeded their acceptable level in all four implants for all studied cases, with the safety factors changing from 0.22 to 0.57 ( n n For the splinting bar, implants, and zygomatic bones, some examples of the distributions of equivalent von Mises stresses under biting are shown in Figures S8–S15 Thus, biting-induced local loading of 50 N on individual artificial incisors of the ROD can cause critical stresses in the zygomatic bones of 15–34 MPa (at an angle of 90°) and 23–60 MPa (at an angle of 45°) for each of the implant attachment areas. When loading teeth No. 1 and No. 2, the maximum stresses were observed at the implant attachment area No. 2 in all the studied cases. However, they developed at implant attachment areas No. 4 and No. 3 when loading teeth No. 3 and No. 4. 4. Discussion In most cases of partial or full maxillectomy, the above-mentioned zygomatic implants are successfully used with their attachment by a two-point support scheme [ 18 33 1 21 33 32 The calculation results on the pairwise attachment of zygomatic implants without combining them with short dental implants were considered in [ 1 15 17 21 15 18 15 17 In this paper, we continue to theoretically study the problem of using zygomatic implants under the treatment of the maxillectomy [ 33 15 Using the CT-DICOM data of a patient after total maxillectomy, the applied computer simulation allowed the visualization and analysis of the distributions of stresses in the (i) zygomatic bones, (ii) titanium implants, (iii) splinting bar, and (iv) polymer ROD. The developed 3D model of the dental structure provided detailed information on the anatomical features of the regions of interest, such as maxillary sinuses and craniofacial bones. It should be noted that the CT data of a real patient assumed certain variations in the contact areas of the implants with the zygomatic. For this reason, the stresses arising in these areas are different. In addition, implants of two standard sizes were used, which should also vary the stresses arising in the zygomatic bones. Table S5 Figure 15 The implants were installed at angles to the occlusal plane; therefore, the vertical forces led to the development of lateral forces in all the studied cases (under both mastication and biting, as well as during insertion and removal of the detachable overdenture). The latter causes bending moments. However, the shunting action of the splinting bar increases the stiffness of the dental structure. At the same time, the occlusal loads were unevenly redistributed among the four implants. The first original result that requires discussion is the closeness of the stress values that arose during both the insertion and removal of the ROD (i.e., under the influence of both compressive and tensile stresses). The equivalent von Mises stress is an invariant of the stress tensor and is a scalar quantity. Thus, the compressive or tensile components of the strain tensor included in the expression for calculating the equivalent stress are the same in absolute values during both the insertion and removal of the ROD. This suggests that a force of similar magnitude but different in sign (direction) acts on the same sections of the dental structure in both cases. Therefore, the components of the principal stress tensor have different signs, but they are equal in absolute value. As a result, the equivalent stresses are the same in both cases since they are equal to the root of the squared differences of the principal stress tensor components. The splinting bar, attached to the base at one end, gives the same response, estimated by the equivalent stresses, when similar forces of different signs act on its unconfined end. Thus, despite the complex shape of the elements of the dental structure, this is true for them, similar to the case of fixing the splinting bar to a simple base. The next important result is the difference in the critical stresses when loading the posterior and anterior teeth. Under mastication, half of the equivalent stresses of the 16 studied do not exceed the threshold level. In the 45° biting loading, all values are higher, while only two are lower at 90°. In general, the obtained results are not unexpected, as loading on the anterior teeth leads to the development of tilting forces, additionally affecting both the implants and zygomatic bones. Finally, the difference in the stress levels was revealed upon axial and off-axis loading on the anterior teeth (under biting), including both the magnitude and the location of the critical stresses. At the same time, the stress values are higher for all components of the dental structure for the 45° biting loading than for the 90°. The reason for this is explained in the previous section. According to the obtained results, the design of the dental structure should be considered acceptable, taking into account the use of the splinting bar as a method of fixing the ROD. As a result, the stiffness of the dental structure was improved, and the stresses were effectively redistributed between the implants consolidated by the splinting bar. The authors suggest that the following aspects might be treated as practical recommendations based on the results obtained in this study: - The cross-section of a splinting bar is usually minimized in order to maintain the compact dimensions of the RODs. This reduces the stiffness of the bar, which can cause its bending and fatigue failure as well. The estimation of stress obtained during computational experiments makes it possible to modify the design (shape) of the bar with a view to its reinforcement. - Analysis of the simulation results made it possible to identify the regions of maximum stress concentration in the splinting bar. Among them are sites of abrupt geometric transitions that are adjacent to the attachment heads. It is recommended to redistribute the stresses by excluding/minimizing sharp stress risers. - The use of a non-circular cross-section of the splinting bar in combination with its topological optimization would allow the stress concentrations to be leveled. - Regarding the design of the dental system, it is recommended to change the type or length of implants as well as their number, since the overdenture can be attached to 2–6 zygomatic implants. - In addition, based on the calculation results, patients can be visually instructed on the cautious application of such systems, and it is expected that high anterior biting forces can be sustained. Despite the large number of simulation results presented above, this study is not free from limitations. Among them are: - the assumptions of linear material properties, the use of which simplifies the obtained results. This is acceptable as a rough approximation, but the non-linear response of the system should be analyzed in further studies on the topic. - The model of the dental system was simplified by excluding soft tissue or muscle forces. - Static loading conditions are delicate and do not characterize the deformation behavior of the dental system under analysis well. - Cyclic loading (fatigue) is the most critical factor in the long-term functioning of the dental system under analysis [ 34 In order to illustrate the activity of the authors in the area of rehabilitation of cancer patients, a brief description of a clinical case with the use of dental implants and a splinting bar is provided below. The 66-year-old patient was hospitalized with a diagnosis of “a combined defect of the middle zone of the face on the right side, including (i) the maxillary, (ii) hard palate and vestibule of the oral cavity, (iii) middle and lower parts of the maxillary sinus, and (iv) zygomatic bone. The reason was extensive tissue resection due to cancer of the mucous membrane of the maxillary bone on the right side”. Clinical examination of the face revealed a clear asymmetry, which consisted of displacement of soft tissues in the eye socket and buccal region, as well as the wings of the nose on the right and left sides ( Figure 16 With the help of preoperative computer-aided planning, the option of installing oncological zygomatic implants with a polished part of the implant body in the zygomatic bone and standard zygomatic implants from the opposite side was modeled. During the surgery, a silicone impression of the position of the implants was obtained. Subsequently, a metal bar with screw fixation of the implants and an ROD was fabricated. The dental prosthesis was fixed on the splinting bar installed on the dental implants within 72 h after the operation. The satisfactory level of retention of the implants (torque of 75 N) in the zygomatic bone made it possible to immediately load them using the ROD. Occlusal contacts with the artificial denture row in the mandible were verified. At least two pairs of teeth were in contact with the antagonists on each side of the RODs. Articulation of the mandible was unhindered. Three months later, a control radiographic inspection was performed in direct projection (TRG) and orthopantomogram (OPTG) in order to confirm the tight contact between the ROD and the bar splinting the dental implants. By doing so, the successful rehabilitation of the patient was achieved. Before reaching a conclusion, the following aspects must be outlined. Currently, practicing dentists and cranio-maxillofacial surgeons have been proposing and using a large number of designs for fixing a ROD with the help of a splinting bar. A variant similar to that described in the literature [ 21 Figure 17 5. Conclusions The results of the computer simulation enabled us to draw the following conclusions. The serial insertion and removal of the detachable overdenture caused identical stresses in the elements of the dental structure. In both cases, the equivalent stresses are equal and do not exceed the critical (fracture) levels for either the removable overdenture or the splinting bar, and especially for the implants. Given the accepted level of critical stress in the zygomatic bones of about 13 MPa, their values may be exceeded during both processes. In the removable overdenture, the equivalent stresses do not exceed the critical levels upon serial loading of 50 N on the posterior teeth (both molars and premolars) under mastication in all studied cases. Taking into account the linear dependence of the applied load and the stresses in the removable overdenture, it can be stated that its integrity could be maintained till the load of 118 N (or the generally accepted typical value of 100 N). In the 90° anterior bite, the equivalent stresses are below the critical level in all the studied cases; therefore, the acceptable value increases up to 213 N, but it is only 63 N at a loading angle of 45°. For all the loading cases studied, the equivalent stresses in the zygomatic bones exceeded the critical level of 13 MPa. Thus, given the specific condition of the patient’s bone tissue, whose CT data were used in the computer simulation, immediate rehabilitation using zygomatic implants (with the studied splinting bar) is not recommended. This is due to the potential loosening of the bone tissue and loss of implant retention. Some calculations exceeded the zygomatic bone strain threshold. The possibilities for reducing the risk of dental bone failure are as follows: (i) changing the number, type, and size of the implants (zygomatic fixtures); (ii) changing the location of the implants’ fixation site; (iii) varying the thickness or hape of the splinting bar; (iv) reducing the retention of the clams; and (v) recommending that the patient handle (insert/remove) the overdenture in a more delicate way.
