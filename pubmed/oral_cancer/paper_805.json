Introduction Increased life expectancy has contributed to an aging population, with global dementia cases estimated to rise from 57.4 million in 2019 to 152.8 million in 2050 [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 n 7 8 7 8 9 Widely consumed in traditional Asian diets, soy foods are rich in isoflavones (daidzein and genistein), phenolic flavonoids with antioxidant and estrogen-like properties linked to cardiovascular [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 While animal studies strongly support the cognitive benefits of fermented soy [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 We previously demonstrated that Q-Can Plus ® 29 30 31 32 33 34 ® 35 36 37 38 39 ® 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Protocol This 12-week, free-living, parallel, triple-blind, placebo-controlled RCT with healthy men and postmenopausal women 65 years and older aimed to explore the effects of a fermented soy product on immunity and cognition ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04866576 Figure 1 29 40 One hundred and forty individuals applied to participate in the study. From these, 106 were assessed for eligibility, 76 of whom were selected to participate. Sixty-three eligible individuals agreed to participate in the study and out of these, two declined to complete the cognitive test battery. The remaining 61 participants were randomized into either one of two groups: fermented soy ( n n Selected subjects were randomly assigned to either the fermented soy or placebo group, stratified by sex. Randomization group status was blinded for participants, clinicians, and statisticians. Household members, such as partners or friends, were randomized together into the same group. After randomization, participants completed questionnaires on demographics and lifestyle habits, including diet, physical activity, stress, sleep, and alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine use. The questionnaires, except for demographics, were repeated at week 12. Trained research clinicians measured participants’ height, weight, and body composition at baseline and week 12 visits. Body weight was measured to the nearest 100 g with an InBody ® Subjects consumed two pre-measured packets of Q-Can Plus ® ® 41 Participants met monthly with the study clinician, at which time they picked up their beverage packets, returned unused packets, and completed questionnaires about their experience with and tolerance of their intervention product. Compliance with the intervention was determined by counting unused, returned packets and subjective assessment of their lifestyle journal. A 90 min comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to participants at baseline and week 12 by psychometrists blinded to participants’ intervention group. Participants were evaluated on the mean change in test scores from baseline to week 12 for global cognition and in the cognitive domains of memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive function. To reduce variability, baseline and end-of-study cognition tests were scheduled for the same time of day and participants had the same psychometrist for both testing sessions. Participants were instructed to keep other conditions known to affect cognition, such as hours of sleep and caffeine intake, similar for baseline and end-of-study testing. We have previously used this cognitive test battery successfully with the older adult population [ 42 43 2.2. Statistical Analyses The primary outcome was to assess mean changes in global cognition and the cognitive domains of memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive function, as measured by a validated battery of cognitive tests. Sample size was calculated for the other primary outcome, immune markers, and including a 10% dropout rate, was estimated at 62. Power for cognitive composite outcomes was calculated post hoc. All analyses were intention-to-treat and included all participants who completed the end-of-study cognitive test battery, regardless of level of compliance. The proportion of maximum scaling method was used to transform raw test scores to a metric from 0 (minimum possible) to 1 (maximum possible) [ 44 p 3. Results Of the 61 participants randomized, most ( n 45 46 p Supplemental Table S1 There were no significant baseline differences between fermented soy and control participants among completers ( Table 1 Cognition Outcomes There were no significant differences between fermented soy and placebo groups in baseline composite scores for global cognition or specific domains of memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive function ( Table 2 Supplemental Table S2 p Table 2 Table 3 Our study group consisted of 75% women, with mostly 70 years and older, so we conducted post hoc analyses to determine if older postmenopausal women had a significantly different response to the fermented soy intervention. We noted significant differences between the fermented soy and placebo groups in women ≥ 70 years for mean change in global cognition and memory scores ( Figure 2 p p Supplemental Table S3 4. Discussion In this 12-week randomized, controlled dietary intervention study investigating the effects of daily consumption of a fermented soy product on cognition in older adults, a modest, but significant improvement was observed in the memory domain. In exploratory analyses, a more pronounced effect was noted among postmenopausal women 70 years and older (8.47% mean improvement in memory scores for fermented soy group compared to 2.05% for placebo group). For comparison, a study in Greece examined normative data on verbal memory scores in older adults and found mean scores were 6.1% to 9.6% lower in the 70–79 year age group compared to the 60–69 year age group [ 47 Memory has been shown to have a stronger response to soy interventions, compared with other cognitive domains [ 48 48 48 41 41 49 Fermented soy may support cognition through multiple complementary mechanisms. Aglycone isoflavones, peptides, and amino acids derived from fermentation have demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, helping to counter oxidative stress, an important contributor to neurodegenerative diseases of aging [ 15 19 50 51 52 20 21 50 53 Isoflavones also interact with estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), which is abundant in the hippocampus and cerebellum, key regions for memory and learning [ 54 55 ® 29 30 35 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT to investigate the effects of a non-probiotic, fermented soy product in a group of cognitively healthy older adults on global and domain-specific cognition. Strengths of this study include the use of a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized design and the use of a broad battery of standardized cognitive tests across different domains of cognition, successfully used by us in previous trials with older adults [ 42 29 56 5. Conclusions We demonstrated that fermented soy improves memory in older adults, with stronger improvements in memory and global cognition observed in postmenopausal women 70 years and older. These findings are hypothesis-generating; thus, causality cannot be inferred, especially given the small sample and exploratory subgroup analysis. Memory is crucial for daily decision making and functioning, and thus regular intake of fermented soy could be a cost-effective way to delay cognitive decline.
