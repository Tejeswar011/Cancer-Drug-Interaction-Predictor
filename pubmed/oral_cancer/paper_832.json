Introduction Neuroleptics are a chemically diverse group of heterocyclic compounds containing a nitrogen atom. Classical neuroleptics consist of phenothiazine, thioxanthene, dibenzoxepine, dihydroindole or a benzamide structure [ 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 2B 1 2 1 6 1 6 7 Flupentixol is a psychotropic drug that belongs to the group of the first-generation typical antipsychotics [ 1 8 trans cis cis 1 7 8 1 9 cis 1 9 1 10 11 12 Figure 1 Currently available neuroleptics have certain limitations. The long-term use of neuroleptics, including those presented above, may cause many adverse effects such as gynecomastia, involuntary movement, metabolic, weight gain and impotence [ 1 13 14 Some studies have described a strong correlation between lipophilicity parameters and the bioactivity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic properties of drug substances [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 MW The aim of the work was to assess and compare the lipophilicity parameters of five neuroleptics—fluphenazine, triflupromazine, trifluoperazine, flupentixol and zuclopenthixol—obtained by means of both computational and chromatographic methods.

Results and Discussion During the first step of our study, we tried to use in silico methods available in the form of both ChemSketch and Molinspiration Cheminformatics software to predict selected physicochemical parameters of the studied compounds [ 26 27 Figure 1 Figure 2 Table 1 Table 1 Figure 2 2 consensus chemaxon ACD/Labs 24 25 26 27 avg) Table 2 Figure 3 ACD/labs, Figure 3 avg Table 2 Table S1 (Supplementary Materials) p Chemaxon Consensus Chemaxon avg Chemaxon Consensus exp exp Table 2 exp exp exp silicos-it avg avg. avg exp 24 consensus ACD/Labs avg Figure 3 When considering a substance as a drug or drug candidate, respectively, it is also essential to determine the blood–brain barrier permeability parameter (logBB) as well as logPS factor, which describes the penetration of the drug into the CNS (central nervous system). Therefore, in the next stage of our research, we proposed an in silico approach—the Percepta platform—to predict both parameters for the studied neuroleptic agents and the new derivative presented in Figure 2 Table 3 Table 3 −6 −6 As is known, some neuroleptics can act as inhibitors of the P450 (CYP) enzyme family, especially CYP3A4 (found in the liver and the intestine) and CYP2D6 (which metabolizes about 25% of medications, including antidepressants and antipsychotics) and can affect their interaction with other drugs; thus, it is essential to develop a cheap, fast and accurate method including in silico models to assess the possible interaction of neuroleptics with cytochromes P450. This study evaluated the usefulness of in silico methods for determining the action of the compounds studied, including the newly proposed structure with the following cytochrome P450, such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4—as shown in Table 3 Table 3 In the final stage of in silico research, various topological indices were calculated for the compounds under study ( Table 4 Table 4 1 0 χ 1 χ 0 χ ν 1 χ ν Figure 4 As part of the continuation of this study, we attempted to use the experimental, i.e., chromatographic method to determine the lipophilicity parameter of five commercially available neuroleptics: fluphenazine, triflupromazine, trifluoperazine, flupentixol and zuclopenthixol. As described in the Materials and Methods Section, we successfully applied thin-layer chromatography in a reverse-phase system (RP-TLC) and various systems containing chromatographic plates: RP-2F 254 254 254 15 16 17 18 19 20 23 MW Table 5 M M MW Supplementary Materials Tables S2–S6 Interestingly, the chromatographic parameters of lipophilicity listed in Table 5 MW Figure 5 MW 254 254 254 254 254 254 Figure 2 To fully compare the lipophilic properties of the tested compounds and the new derivative, we presented all the obtained lipophilicity parameters (logP and R MW Figure 6 Further analysis of the chromatographic parameters listed in Figure 6 254 254 254 17 Figure 6 MW Figure 2 MW 254 254 254 Furthermore, to compare the relationships between logP values and chromatographic lipophilicity parameter R MW Table S7 (Supplementary Materials) Analysis of the data listed in Table S7 MW silicos-it 254 Consensus MW 254 ACD/Labs exp Good correlations can be also observed between certain R MW MW 254 MW 254 These results justify the use of various chromatographic plates and mobile phases to find the optimal conditions for the lipophilicity study of examined neuroleptics and their derivatives in the future.

It was SRD analysis, i.e., the sum of ranking differences. The study was conducted to compare data describing the group of tested drugs. The analysis proposed by Prof. Heberger and described in his works [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Figure 7 The Wiener (W), Rouvray (R) and Pyka A indices will be the best in this role. In the same group, there is also molar mass and molar volume, which are very closely related to the structure of the compound. For this entire group of parameters, SRD = 0. Other useful indices, not far from the reference for which SRD = 2, are the other topological indices, namely the Gutman valence index (M ν 0 χ ν 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Reagents and Materials The reference standards (purity ≥ 98%) of five investigated compounds, including fluphenazine, triflupromazine, trifluoperazine, flupentixol and zuclopenthixol in the form of hydrochlorides, respectively, were provided by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Working standard solutions of the cited compounds at a concentration of 2 mg/mL were prepared in methanol. Buffer TRIS (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) with a pH of 7.4 was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, St. Gallen, Switzerland). The HPLC-grade solvents distilled water, acetonitrile, acetone and 1,4-dioxane were from POCH (Gliwice, Poland). TLC plates were precoated with silica gel RP-2F 254 254 254 3.2. TLC Analysis The chromatographic study was carried out on 10 × 10 cm plates developed using the following mixtures: acetone–buffer TRIS, acetonitrile–buffer TRIS and 1,4-dioxane–buffer TRIS ( v v 3.3.

Conclusions In this work, the importance of the hybrid method, i.e., chromatographic methods such as RP-TLC and calculation for evaluation of the lipophilicity and other ADMET properties of the neuroleptics fluphenazine, triflupromazine, trifluoperazine, flupentixol and zuclopenthixol, was discussed.
