Introduction Fibromyalgia (FM) pain afflicts approximately 2–8% of the global population, and its prevalence is predicted to increase in many regions due to the aging of the population. Diagnosing and treating fibromyalgia are challenging as it is difficult to ascertain the cause of pain, and there is a lack of reliable biomarkers. Pain typically affects the muscles, ligaments, tendons, and soft tissues, particularly in the shoulders, back, chest, arms, and legs [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Fibromyalgia may also involve the dysregulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system, suggesting that cannabinoids could potentially be used as another treatment. These compounds were first isolated from cannabis leaves, and analogs were subsequently isolated in various tissues (termed endocannabinoids) [ 8 9 10 11 12 11 12 The signaling pathways between neurons and glial cells are crucial drivers of chronic pain progression. Neuronal damage or pathology can induce the phenotypic transformation of microglia and astrocytes to a proinflammatory state, and this reactive transformation is strongly associated with allodynia or hyperalgesia. Microglia in the inflammatory M1 state release proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukins (ILs), and chemokines that ultimately initiate hyperalgesia and chronic pain [ 13 14 15 16 17 In Asia, acupuncture has been used for over 3000 years to treat various diseases, including chronic pain. Given its efficacy and safety, acupuncture is now practiced worldwide to treat back, low back, and dental pain, headaches, tennis elbow, and fibromyalgia, among other chronic pain conditions [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 In the current study, we examined the effects of glial inflammatory transformation, CB1 activity, and TLR4 signaling on fibromyalgia-like pain and the efficacy of EA treatment in an intermittent cold stress (ICS) mouse model. We found that ICS induced both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, activated microglia and astrocytes in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), spinal cord, and PAG, and enhanced the expression levels of HMGB1, S100B, TLR4, MyD88, and TRAF6 in these regions, while EA mitigated all of these responses. Further, the behavioral and molecular signs of fibromyalgia were also depleted by Trpv1 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Mice and Fibromyalgia Pain Model The experimental subjects were 8–12-week-old female C57B/L6 wild-type mice (18–20 g) purchased from BioLasc Taiwan Ltd. (Yilan, Taiwan). We used female mice to reflect the higher prevalence of fibromyalgia pain in human females than males. After the mice arrived, they were placed in a home cage with a 12 h light/dark cycle (light 6 a.m. to 6 p.m). The temperature was maintained at 25 °C with 60% moisture. The experiments were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of China Medical University, Taiwan (permit no. CMUIACUC-2024-076), according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Trpv1 −/− Trpv1 −/− 2.2. Nociceptive Behavior Examinations Mice were placed in separate Plexiglas boxes that were perforated overhead, placed on an elevated horizontal wire mesh stand, covered with a dark cloth, maintained in a silent environment at room temperature (25 °C), and allowed to habituate for 30 min before starting the behavioral test. The experiments were only conducted when the mice were calm and all their feet were placed on the surface, without grooming or sleeping taking place. We used the von Frey filament measuring instrument (IITC Life Science Inc., Irwindale, CA, USA) to increase the pain pressure in the center of the right plantar hind paw of the mice. Maximum pressure was reached when the right hind paw was lifted using the plastic tip and the mouse reflexively withdrew the hind paw. We allowed for 3 min breaks between stimuli. The results were recorded as mechanical sensitivity. The Hargreaves test was used to measure the thermal sensitivity of the mice, and the preparations used were similar to those used for the von Frey test. The subjects were placed in an animal enclosure that separated the mice to limit interaction and covered using a dark cloth. After giving the mice 30 min to get used to this habitat, the experiments were initiated. The IITC Plantar Analgesia Meter (IITC Life Sciences, SERIES8, Model 390G) (Irwindale, CA, USA) was used to measure the withdrawal latency time of the mice subjected to radiant heat applied on the surface, targeting the center of the right hind paw. 2.3. Electroacupuncture After being anesthetized with 5% isoflurane for the induction, the mice were maintained via inhaling 1% isoflurane via a head-stuffed tube. A pair of 1” acupuncture needles (32G, Yu Kuang Chem. Ind. Corp., Tainan City, Taiwan) were implanted bilaterally into the ST36 acupoint. The ST36 acupoint in mice is 3–4 mm below the patella, between the fibula and tibia, and on the anterior side of the anterior tibial muscle. The acupoint was electrically stimulated with a constant square pulse with 1 mA intensity, 2 Hz frequency, and 100 μs width for 20 min from a Trio 300 stimulator (Ito, Tokyo, Japan). The EA treatment sessions were performed on days 3 and 4. 2.4. Western Blot Analysis Proteins were extracted from the DRG, SC, thalamus, SSC, and CB of the mice. The protein extracts were prepared; then, 10% radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer (Fivephoton Biochemicals, San Diego, CA, USA, RIPA-50), 100 μL of a protease inhibitor (Bionovas, Beijing, China, FC0070-0001), and 100 μL of phosphatase inhibitor (Bionovas, FC0050-0001) were added to the lysate. After homogenization, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in an adjustable centrifuge. A total of 10 μL of extracted tissue sample was subjected to 8% or 12% SDS Tris-glycine gel electrophoresis, according to the protein size. A current electrophoresis power supply (PowerPac, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Singapore) was used to run the gels in two different sections: Section 1 Section 2 2.5.

Results 3.1. Electroacupuncture (2 Hz) and Trpv1 Gene Knockout Diminished Mechanical and Thermal Hyperalgesia in Intermittent Cold Stress (ICS)-Induced Fibromyalgia Model Mice To examine the efficacy of EA against fibromyalgia-like mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and the potential effects of CB1 channel signaling, we established ICS-induced fibromyalgia model mice on the wild-type and Trpv1 −/− Figure 1 Figure 1 n Figure 1 n Trpv1 −/− Figure 1 n Figure 1 n Figure 1 n Trpv1 −/− Figure 1 n Trpv1 Figure 1 3.2. Both EA and Trpv1 Knockout Reduced Fibromyalgia-like Pain in ICS Model Mice by Suppressing Microglial and Astrocytic Activation and Promoting CB1 Pathway Activity The induction of chronic pain states is frequently accompanied by the reactive transformation of microglia and astrocytes into proinflammatory phenotypes. To assess the effects of reactive transformation on the model’s induction and therapeutic responses, we estimated the expression levels of marker proteins for reactive transformation 4 days after fibromyalgia induction ( Figure 2 Figure 2 p n Trpv1 Trpv1 −/− Figure 2 p n Trpv1 Figure 2 # p n Figure 2 p n Trpv1 Figure 2 # p n Figure 2 p n Figure 2 # p n Trpv1 Figure 2 n 3.3. EA and Trpv1 Knockout Suppressed Fibromyalgia-like Hyperalgesia Through the Modulation of Glial Signaling at the Spinal Cord and Hypothalamic and PAG Levels Similarly to DRG, the expression levels of the astrocyte and microglial markers GFAP and Iba1 were elevated in the lumbar spinal cord (SC) tissue of FM group mice compared with the Normal group ( Figure 3 p n Trpv1 −/− Trpv1 −/− Figure 3 Figure 3 p n Trpv1 Figure 3 # p n Trpv1 Figure 3 # p n Figure 4 Figure 5 3.4. EA Significantly Reduced Fibromyalgia-like Hyperalgesia Through CB1 Receptor Activation The von Frey test demonstrated that ICS induced fibromyalgia-like mechanical hyperalgesia and that this effect was associated with the downregulation of CB1 receptors in the DRG, SC, hypothalamus, and PAG, while the mitigation of hyperalgesia via EA and Trpv1 Trpv1 Figure 6 3.5. Distinct Downstream Mechanisms for EA-Induced CB1-Mediated Suppression of Fibromyalgia-like Hyperalgesia in the Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems We next examined whether similar downstream signaling pathways are involved in the peripheral and central effects of EA ( Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 7 p n Figure 7 p n Figure 7 p n Figure 7 p n Figure 7 p n We then examined the central effects of EA and the effects of the CB1 stimulation by measuring the expression levels of the same proteins in the PAG ( Figure 8 Figure 8 p n Figure 8 p n Figure 8 p n Figure 8 p n Table S1 4. Discussion Abd-ellatief et al. reported that peripheral hyperalgesia following the intramuscular injection of acid saline was accompanied by the proinflammatory signaling factors IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α having increased serum concentrations. In the nervous system, astrocytes and microglia are central mediators of inflammatory responses, suggesting that immune activation of these cells contributes to hyperalgesia in chronic pain conditions. Indeed, light and electron microscopy studies of FM model rats have revealed neurodegeneration and astrogliosis in the hippocampus accompanied by the augmented expression of the reactive transformation markers GFAP and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These responses were depleted by the α2-adrenergic receptor agonist and analgesic compound dexmedetomidine [ 28 29 30 The activation of microglia is also strongly implicated in fibromyalgia. Albrecht et al. reported widespread microglia activation in the cortex of fibromyalgia patients compared with the Normal subjects, as revealed by positron emission tomography (PET) using [11C]PBR28 as a tracer for the activated microglial marker translocator protein (TSPO). The fatigue observed in patients with fibromyalgia was also associated with hypertrophy of the anterior and posterior middle cingulate cortices, which is, again, consistent with neuroinflammation and microglia activation [ 31 32 33 Trpv1 A recent study of 2000 fibromyalgia patients found that over 60% used cannabinoids to relieve their pain and alleviate their symptoms. While cannabinoids can relieve pain conditions, about half of patients experience side effects [ 34 35 36 37 The administration of LPS to healthy individuals with moderately severe fibromyalgia augmented leptin levels and repressed fractalkine levels, as measured using a multi-cytokine ELISA. In addition, fibromyalgia patients displayed lower concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-12, and IL-17A compared with the healthy controls, consistent with immunoreactions induced via TLR4 signaling [ 38 39 40 2+ 41 Trpv1 5. Conclusions The current study revealed that the suppression of fibromyalgia-like pain in a mouse model via EA requires the activation of the CB1–TLR4 signaling pathway, the mitigation of glial activation, and the suppression of the TLR4–MyD88–TRAF6 signaling pathway. Indeed, both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia were attenuated by Trpv1 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biomedicines13092112/s1 p Author Contributions I.-H.H., M.-C.L. and H.-C.H.: conceptualization, methodology, software, data curation, writing—original draft, visualization, and investigation.
