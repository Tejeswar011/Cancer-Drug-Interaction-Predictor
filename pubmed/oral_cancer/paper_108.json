This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/370003-a-bibliometric-analysis-of-30-years-of-pediatric-surgery-publications-in-saudi-arabia Pediatric surgery is a relatively new specialty in Saudi Arabia. Over the years, the number of specialized institutions and pediatric surgeons has gradually increased. This study aimed to analyze the quantity, quality, and structural indicators of pediatric surgery publications in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective online review of pediatric surgery publications affiliated with Saudi institutions was conducted from January 1991 to December 2020. A total of 496 publications were analyzed. The annual number of publications increased over time, peaking at 35 in 2014. The highest cumulative number of publications over five years was 131 between 2016 and 2020. Most publications (65.7%) were affiliated with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education. Regionally, the majority were from institutions in Riyadh, followed by Makkah, the Eastern Region, and Asir. Case reports and case series constituted 49.4% of the publications, followed by retrospective chart reviews (30.2%). Notably, 96.3% of the publications were unfunded, and interinstitutional collaboration was limited (5.6%). The highest citation count was 179, with a peak age-corrected citation rate of 19.89 per year. While the number of publications increased, citation rates declined after peaking between 2006 and 2010. Based on our findings, although pediatric surgery research productivity is increasing, most publications are case reports or case series. Limited collaboration and funding may influence research quality and citation impact. bibliometric analyses citation analysis clinical research productivity healthcare research kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa) pediatric surgery pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Bibliometric analysis is an evolving field of science that applies mathematical and statistical measures to describe, evaluate, or compare publications in a specific field [ 1 1 2 2 3 4 1 2 In pediatric surgery, multiple bibliometric studies have been conducted, including assessments of fields of research, research journal output, countries’ contributions to literature, and training program productivity [ 3 5 9 5 7 7 8 In Saudi Arabia, the pediatric surgery specialty was recognized in 1980, and since then, the number of practicing pediatric surgeons has increased to 50 in 20 years, reaching 147 practicing consultants in 2021 [ 10 11 12 13 14 24 Materials and methods A retrospective online review of the following databases was conducted via convenience sampling: Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, Google Scholar, Embase, and PubMed to retrieve publications from Saudi Arabia. Publications that were affiliated with pediatric surgery and/or authored by a pediatric surgeon in Saudi Arabia from January 1991 to December 2020 were included. Publications that were conducted completely abroad, those that were non-relevant to the pediatric surgery field (except publications in medical education and basic sciences) were excluded. The included publications were research-based only; thus, posters, videos, letters to editors, and book chapters were excluded. The publications were then examined for data collection. The collected variables included the year of publication, the sector and the region affiliated with the research institution, the area of interest, the methodology, the number of authors, funding, collaboration, and the publishing journal. All variables were obtained from published manuscripts. A five-year interval from the year of publication was factored in. Collaboration was defined as institutional participation in data collection. Authors' affiliations with different institutions were considered a collaboration in meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and review articles only. Funded publications were identified by the information on funding grants in their manuscripts. The areas of interest of the publications were classified into 10 categories: abdomen, gastroenterology, trauma, thoracic, oncology, vascular, obesity, head and neck, medical education, and miscellaneous. As a measurement of research impact, the number of citations was obtained from Google Scholar, WoS, or Scopus. If there was an inconsistency in the number of citations between different databases, the highest number of citations was used. The age-corrected citation rate was calculated by dividing the number of citations by the number of years since the publication year [ 8 The data were collected and managed using Microsoft Excel (2016). IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 22) (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for data description and data analysis. The categorical variables, including year of publication, five-year interval from year of publication, research institution, affiliation, area of interest, methodology, funding, collaboration, and the publishing journal, are presented as frequencies. Numerical variables - including the number of authors, citation, and age-corrected citation - were described in median and/or ranges. Chi-squared test was used to compare the outcome variable groups and all categorical variables, and a t-test in numerical variables. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The total number of reviewed publications was 663; only 496 publications met the inclusion criteria. The reasons for exclusion are demonstrated in Figure 1 1 Figure 1 Chart depicting the data collection process Table 1 Number of publications per five-year intervals Year of publication N (%) 1991 - 1995 28 (5.6) 1996 - 2000 59 (11.9) 2001 - 2005 53 (10.7) 2006 - 2010 95 (19.2) 2011 - 2015 130 (26.2) 2016 - 2020 131 (26.4) Total 496 (100) The highest number of publications was from the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of Education (MOE), and the Ministry of National Guard (MNG), with 166, 160, and 66 publications, respectively. These sectors' publication productivity was the highest between the years 2011 - 2015. The private sector started to contribute to Saudi pediatric surgery literature in 2013, with eight publications from 2013 to 2020 (Table 2 Table 2 Number of publications per sector over five-year intervals Data are presented as n (%) Sector/year 1991 - 1995 1996 - 2000 2001 - 2005 2006 - 2010 2011 - 2015 2016 - 2020 Total Ministry of Health 6 (3.6) 18 (10.8) 23 (13.9) 40 (24.1) 43 (25.9) 36 (21.7) 166 (33.5) Ministry of Education 12 (7.5) 18 (11.3) 14 (8.8) 31 (19.4) 45 (28.1) 40 (25) 160 ( 32.3) National Guard 0 (0) 9 (13.6) 9 (13.6) 6 (9.1) 26 (39.5) 16 (24.2) 66 (13.3) King Faisal Specialist Hospital 10 (16.4) 11 (18) 1 (1.6) 9 (14.8) 9 (14.8) 21 (34.4) 61 (12.3) Ministry of Defense 0 (0) 3 (8.6) 6 (17.1) 9 (25.7) 6 (17.2) 11 (31.4) 35 (7.1) Private sector 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (12.5) 7 (87.5) 8 (1.6) In terms of region, 486 publications (98%) were affiliated with institutions in four of the 13 regions in Saudi Arabia.

The contributions of the other regions in terms of publication productivity amounted to 10 publications: from Madinah (n = 4), Tabuk and Hail (n = 2), and Najran regions (n = 1) (Table 3 Table 3 Publications per region over five-year intervals Data are presented as n (%) Sector/year 1991 - 1995 1996 - 2000 2001 - 2005 2006 - 2010 2011 - 2015 2016 - 2020 Total Riyadh 23 (9.5) 38 (15.8) 22 (9.2) 42 (17.5) 67 (28) 48 (20) 240 (48.4) Makkah 5 ( 4.1) 9 (7.5) 10 (8.3) 20 (16.7) 23 (19.2) 53 (44.2) 120 ( 24.2) Eastern Province 0 (0) 10 (9.5) 18 (17.1) 26 (24.8) 36 (34.3) 15 (14.3) 105 (21.2) Asir 0 (0) 2 (9.6) 3 (14.3) 7 (33.3) 2 (9.5) 7 (33.3) 21 (4.2) Other regions 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 2 (20) 8 (80) 10 (2) Table 4 Table 4 Publications by area of interest Area of interest N (%) Abdomen and gastroenterology 225 (45.4) Genitourinary 82 (16.5) Thoracic and pulmonary 59 (11.9) Oncology and hematology 33 (6.7) Miscellaneous 25 (5) Trauma 18 (3.6) Obesity 17 (3.4) Vascular 15 (3) Head and neck 13 (2.6) Medical education 9 (1.8) Total 496 (100) The publications were divided into 10 categories based on methodology. Case reports and case series constituted the highest number of publications, representing 49.4% of the total publications, and ranged from 44.2% to 62.7% of the total publications in each five-year interval, followed by retrospective chart reviews, which represented 30.2% and ranged from 19.8% to 45.3% of the total publications in each five-year interval. Cohort studies were the third most common methodology and represented 8.7% of the total publications, ranging from 3.6% of publications between 1991 and 1995 to 16% of publications between 2016 and 2020. The total proportion of meta-analyses and systematic reviews was 1.4%, and that of clinical trials was 2.6% of publications.

There was no statistically significant difference between the number of authors with different publication methodologies (p = 0.57). The median number of authors in clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses was less than or equal to the median number of authors in case reports, case series, and retrospective chart reviews (Table 6 Table 6 Median number of authors by publication methodology Methodology Median Range (minimum - maximum ) Clinical practice guideline 14 23 (2 - 25) Case-control studies 7 8 (1 - 9) Cross-sectional studies 6 10 (1 - 11) Animal and cell studies 4 3 (2 - 5) Retrospective chart review 4 3 (2 - 5) Case reports and case series 3 10 (1 - 11) Cohort studies 3 16 (1 - 17) Clinical trials 3 9 (1 - 10) Systematic review and meta-analysis 2 3 (1 - 4) Review article 1 3 (1 - 4) Total 3 24 (1 - 25) P = O.57 Collaboration was observed in 28 publications, representing 5.6% of the overall publications. Collaboration between centers in the same region was found in 14 publications, and collaboration between centers in different regions was found in 11 publications. Three publications were conducted through collaboration with centers in different countries: two collaborations with institutions in Egypt and one with an institution in Canada. The methodology included 13 retrospective chart reviews, five cohort studies, three randomized clinical trials, three case series, a case‒control study, a cross-sectional study, a review article, and a meta-analysis. The majority of the publications did not receive any funds (n = 480, 96.3%), and only 16 publications (3.2%) stated that they had received funds. All of the funded publications were affiliated with MOE institutions and were conducted in Riyadh Region (n = 13), Makkah Region (n = 2), and Eastern Region (n = 1). The funded publications included seven retrospective chart reviews, two randomized clinical trials, two cross-sectional studies, two cohort studies, a clinical practice guideline, a case series, and an animal laboratory study. The number of citations per publication ranged between 0 and 179 citations, and the median number of citations was six.

There was no statistically significant difference between funded publications and the number of citations (p = 0.45) and the age-corrected citation rate (p = 0.075). Publications involving collaborations between institutions had a significantly higher rate of age-corrected citation rate (p = 0.004), but no difference was noted in the number of citations (p = 0.67). The journals varied greatly in terms of international and national publishers.

Pediatric surgery as a specialty is relatively new compared to other medical specialties in Saudi Arabia. The number of institutions providing pediatric surgery services and the number of pediatric surgeons have increased gradually over the last 40 years [ 10 11 ​The highest number of publications was conducted in institutions affiliated with the MOH, which can be attributed to the number of institutions compared with other sectors [ 11 One of the characteristics of pediatric surgery as a specialty is its involvement in different body systems and diseases in a pediatric surgeon's clinical practice; this is represented in the variations in the publications' areas of interest. The highest number of publications involved the abdomen and gastroenterology, followed by genitourinary publications and thoracic publications. The publications on obesity are almost exclusively affiliated with the obesity research center at King Saud University in Riyadh (n=13), which is funded exclusively by the Obesity Research Chair. Moreover, the publication with the highest citation and age-corrected citation rates was funded by this research chair, demonstrating the efficiency of specialized research chairs in promoting high-quality research. Trauma-related publications accounted for 3.6% of the total, a relatively low percentage given the prevalence and significance of road traffic accidents in Saudi Arabia. Traffic accidents are the second leading cause of death overall and the main cause of death in children [ 25 Research methodology is considered one of the most important parameters for critically appraising a publication. In our study, the most common methodologies used were case reports and case series. Case reports and case series are important descriptive tools for novel, unusual, or atypical cases and are important for educational purposes or for generating further research questions. They are especially attractive to researchers with limited resources and funding since they are feasible and easily written; unfortunately, they do not rank highly in the hierarchy of research evidence. Retrospective chart reviews represented 30.25% of the publications and were the second most commonly used methodology. Like case studies, retrospective chart methodologies require limited resources. This is followed by cohort studies, which have become the third most common methodology, as the percentage of cohort studies over 5-year intervals has increased over time. Retrospective chart review publications increased gradually and peaked between 2006-2010 at 45.3% of publications; then, they started to decrease gradually until they reached 19.8% of publications between 2016-2020. During the same period, an increase in the number of cohort studies and cross-sectional studies was observed. The first published clinical trial was in 1998, whereas the first randomized controlled clinical trial was in 2014. The first systematic review was published in 2010, followed by the first meta-analysis in 2011. The number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses doubled between 2016 and 2020 compared with 2006-2010. There were two publications on animal and cell studies conducted in research labs, and there were two clinical practice guidelines. Notably, the methodologies that ranked higher in the hierarchy of evidence have been utilized more in recent years than in older publications, which reflects the gradual evolution in the conduct of research. Many factors contribute to the number of authors per publication, including the expected workload, human resources, financial support, and publishers’ authors' guidelines. Although the median number of authors across different methodologies did not differ significantly, our observation was that the number of authors did not match the expected number of authors according to methodology; for example, we observed controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses that were conducted by a single author, whereas 61 case reports and case series were conducted by five or more authors. The possibility of the presence of nonscientific factors, such as social or political factors, must be studied. On the other hand, the production of publications that are expected to need a greater number of research personnel with much smaller teams or a single author raises concerns about the quality and integrity of the publication. Further analysis of the publications’ authorship must be conducted to analyze the current situation and improve the quality of the literature. Research funding is considered one of the major impetuses contributing to the successful execution of a research project; it provides research projects with the necessary materials and affords human resources when required [ 26 26 To improve the quantity and quality of national research productivity in pediatric surgery, we recommend studying the factors that affect research funding and the impact of funding on publication quality. Research collaboration between researchers and institutions has been widely recognized as essential in the literature, as collaboration enhances the quantity and quality of publications [ 27 28 The number of citations is considered one of the most important quality indicators of a publication and might represent peers' recognition [ 29 30 The age-corrected citation rate is another performance indicator that can be used to assess the quality of a publication [ 31 Limitations This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, as the first bibliometric analysis focusing on pediatric surgery publications in Saudi Arabia, it may not comprehensively capture all relevant research outputs-particularly those published in non-indexed local journals-potentially leading to underreporting. Second, data collection was based on author names and institutional affiliations, which may result in the overrepresentation of certain sectors or regions due to a snowball effect. Additionally, the analysis of authorship and funding may be affected by underreporting or misreporting, given the variability in publisher requirements and manuscript disclosures. Lastly, key factors influencing research productivity-such as institutional policies, resource availability, and individual motivation-were not directly assessed, limiting the ability to fully understand the drivers behind publication trends. Future studies incorporating qualitative methods, such as stakeholder interviews and broader data sources, could offer deeper insights and help advance pediatric surgical research in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions This study demonstrated the gradual increase in publications related to pediatric surgery in Saudi Arabia over the last three decades. Most publications were not funded, and collaboration between institutions was very limited, although collaboration is correlated with a higher age-corrected citation rate. The number of citations and the age-corrected citation rate have declined after peaking between 2006 and 2010, despite the growing number of publications. To improve the quantity and quality of national research productivity in pediatric surgery, we recommend the employment of research-specialized human resources, the creation of a data registry, and the implementation of policies to support collaboration between different centers.
