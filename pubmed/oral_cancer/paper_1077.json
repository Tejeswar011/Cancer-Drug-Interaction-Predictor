Background: Valproic acid (VPA) is the medication prescribed for the treatment of bipolar disorder, epilepsy, and migraine. It is reported that the VPA treatment leads to biotin deficiency due to the low serum biotinidase activity. Alopecia or hair loss is another common side effect of valproate administration. Aim: The study aims to investigate hair loss complaint in people, who are on Valproate and find the association between valproate levels, serum biotinidase activity and hair loss in persons treated with valproate. Methods: This two years cross sectional comparative study involving 150 participants was performed at department of Psychiatry of a tertiary care teaching hospital. The study group had 75 persons taking Valproate compared with 75 persons in the control group. Blood samples were collected for estimation of serum VPA levels and serum biotinidase activity. Quantification of alopecia biomarker Interleukin (IL)-2 was estimated. Data was analyzed by using student T test, Pearson’s correlation, and Mann Whitney U Results: The study group comprised of 40 males and 35 females with a mean age of 42.04 (±12.85) years. The control group had 39 males and 36 females with a mean age of 38.38 (±14.42) years. Hair loss was reported in 18 (24%) persons of study cohort compared to 2 (2.66%) among the control group. There was a statistically significant difference between biotinidase levels across the participants with hair loss complaint and those without hair loss complaint. (Mean rank of participants with hair loss complaint = 43.30, mean rank of participants without hair loss complaint = 80.45, U = 656.000, P IL2 P Conclusion: It can be concluded that there is an association between Valproate levels, biotinidase activity and hair loss.

Alopecia or hair loss is another common side effect of VPA administration.[ 6 n 7 8 9 10 11 A few studies have reported the association between serum biotinidase levels and alopecia in small sample population.[ 7 12 13 14 10 11 However, research studies correlating VPA levels, serum biotinidase activity and hair loss were conducted mainly on pediatric patients indicating the need for establishing the correlation between VPA levels and serum biotinidase activity in larger adult population. Hence, this case control study is designed to investigate the hair loss complaint among people, who are on Valproate and the association between VPA levels, serum biotinidase activity and an alopecia marker IL-2 in persons treated with VPA in a large Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS Site The study was conducted in the department of psychiatry of a tertiary care teaching hospital from 2018 to 2021. It was originally planned to be completed in 2020 however got delayed due to the Covid pandemic by 1 year. Sample size Sample size was calculated by using the formula n 2 2 P Ethical clearance The study was conducted after obtaining the approval from institutional ethics committee. (Protocol No: 2017/315). Patient enrolment Inclusion criteria for treatment group Inclusion criteria were adult patients more than 18 years of age of any gender, who are currently on VPA monotherapy only for at least 3 months for any medical indication. Exclusion criteria for treatment group Exclusion criteria were patients treated with VPA in combination with other drugs, participants receiving biotin supplements in the last three months and pregnant and lactating women. Inclusion criteria for control group Participants for control group included first degree relatives of respective patients, who were willing to participate in the study. This was conducted to eliminate genetic, dietary, and environmental factors. In case of non-willing first degree relative or upon unavailability of first degree relative of the patient, visitors of patients visiting the Medical College Hospital and volunteering to participate in the study were included. The Participants were adults aged more than 18 years of any gender who are apparently healthy physically and mentally (no formal testing or evaluation conducted; however, should not have any diagnosed disease/disorders at the time of recruitment). Exclusion criteria for control group Any Participant who was on VPA treatment in the last 1 year, participants who received biotin supplements in last 3 months and Pregnant/lactating women were excluded. We excluded pregnant and lactating persons as these conditions could affect the levels of the testing parameters and they are more likely to receive oral/parenteral supplements during this period. Clinical data collection After explaining the study and getting informed consent from the patients, socio-demographic details and a clinical data sheet was filled recording the details of the history and investigational findings. Hair loss during valproate therapy was enquired and documented. Dosage and route of administration of VPA was as directed by the treating clinician. Sample collection Blood samples were collected either 12 hours or 24 hours after the last dose of valproate, depending on the half-life. Blood was collected prior to the intake of next dosage. Blood samples (3 ml) was collected through routine venipuncture in red top tubes, transferred to the lab, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min to separate the serum. Serum samples were frozen at −80°C till further analysis. Experimental methodology Estimation of serum VPA levels VPA concentrations in serum were determined using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LCMS) method. This was conducted in ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) Model – Agilent infinity II 1290, using Zorbax 1.8 microns, 2.1 mm dia, 5 cm column and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) method. Mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid and 90% ACN in 0.1% Formic acid. The extraction was done in 100% methanol; the run time was 15 mins in MS/MS, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The Ion Source was ESI with IonDrive Turbo V technology. The samples were acquired using QTRAP 6500 (AB SCIEX, USA). Estimation of serum biotinidase levels Biotidinase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring p-aminobenzoate liberation from N-biotinyl-p-aminobenzoate. The enzyme assay was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml serum to 1.9 ml of a mixture containing 200 mmol potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 20 mmol ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.5 mg serum albumin, and 0.3 mmol N-biotinyl-p-aminobenzoate bringing the final volume to 2 ml. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 ml of 30% tri chloro acetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. Then, 1.5 ml of the supernatant was added to 0.5 ml water. At room temperature, and at 3-min intervals, 0.2 ml of 0.1% sodium nitrite (prepared fresh daily), 0.2 mL of 0.5% ammonium sulfamate and 0.2 ml of 0.1% N-1-naphthyl ethylenediamine hydrochloride were added in succession and incubated for 10 min, and then the spectrophometric absorbance was measured at 546 nm. Biotidinase activity is expressed as nmol of p-aminobenzoate liberated per min per mL serum. Quantification of alopecia biomarker IL-2 IL-2 Data analysis Student’s t P RESULTS Among 75 participants of the study group, 40 (53.3%) participants were male and 35 (46.7%) were female. 37 (49.3%) participants of the study group were taking Divalproex while 38 (50.7%) were taking Sodium valproate. Among 75 participants of the control group, 39 (52%) of them were male and 36 (48%) were female. 43 (57.3%) participants of the control group were first degree relatives of the participants, while 32 (42.7%) were neutral participants.

Mean age of the control group was 38.38 years (±14.42; range 17–76 years). Dosage of valproate for 62 (82.7%) patients of the study group was less than or equal to 500 mg/day; 11 (14.7%) patients were taking between 501–1000 mg/day and 2 (2.7%) patients were taking 1001 to 1500 mg/day. Frequency of intake of VPA was 63 (84%) patients of the study group was once daily (OD) and that of 12 (16%) was twice daily (BD). Indication for VPA intake in 70 (93.3%) patients of the study group was bipolar disorder, that for 4 (5.3%) was epilepsy and 1 (1.3%) was schizoaffective disorder. Hair loss was reported in 18 (24%) patients of the study group, while 57 (76%) had no such complaints. No hair loss complaint was reported in 73 (97.33%) participants of the control group while it was reported by 2 (2.66%) of the control group.

It was found that there was low biotinidase levels in persons taking valproate as compared to the control group. The biotinidase level across the participants with hair loss complaint is comparatively less than the participants without hair loss complaint. There is a statistically significant difference between the IL2 The common adverse drug reactions reported on valproate administration are weight gain, tremor, gastro-intestinal disturbances, liver dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and hair loss. Valproate’s effect on hair is interesting and is very much essential in clinical practice.[ 15 16 17 18 19 10 13 18 20 Authors in a case study of 16 years male who developed Pityriasis Amiantacea (PA) after the use of valproic acid proposed that the keratinocyte proliferative activity of valproic acid was mediated through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and subsequent activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway could play the role in the development of PA.[ 20 21 22 23 This is one of the largest studies on this topic till date. The control population were from a similar background. Study looked at hair loss, biotinidase activity and IL2 Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional nature, sampling technique, eligibility criteria as it is possible earlier drugs could have still influenced, the choice of control population taken, we could not get a family member for all participants, verbal responses were taken about hair loss that is subjective. We studied only one possible biomarker IL-2 CONCLUSION There is an association between valproic acid, biotinidase levels and hair loss. Clinicians should be watchful of hair loss complaint while prescribing valproate as it is a molecule frequently used by many specialties.
