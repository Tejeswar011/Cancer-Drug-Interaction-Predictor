Introduction Aromatic and medicinal plants have long been recognized for their ability to produce a wide variety of bioactive secondary metabolites, among which essential oils (EOs) are particularly valued. These oils are volatile at room temperature, hydrophobic, and can be extracted from various plant parts such as flowers, leaves, roots, bark, fruits, and seeds [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Beyond their sensory properties, essential oils have attracted scientific interest for their wide range of biological activities, notably their antimicrobial potential. Their natural origin, low toxicity, biodegradability, and cost-effectiveness make them appealing alternatives to synthetic antimicrobials, particularly in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance [ 8 9 10 11 Among the most studied EO components are phenylpropenes, especially eugenol and estragole, which occur in various medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs). Eugenol (C 10 12 2 Syzygium aromaticum 12 13 10 12 Foeniculum vulgare 14 15 Essential oils (HEs) are complex mixtures of bioactive compounds, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, ketones, and terpenoids. Key compounds like limonene, caryophyllene, eugenol, estragole, citral, linalool, geranyl acetate, camphor, and eucalyptol ( Figure 1 16 This study focuses on the extraction of essential oils from two plants: clove buds and fennel seeds, and the analysis of their chemical compositions. Additionally, the major compounds of these essential oils were isolated. The antibacterial activity of the extracted essential oils and their main compounds was evaluated against three bacterial strains. The objective of this study was to compare the antibacterial activity of essential oils (HE) and their main compounds to determine if the isolated compounds exhibit higher efficacy than the crude oils themselves. Additionally, the activity of isolated compounds was compared, and the findings were validated through in silico 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Sourcing and Preparation of Material Clove buds and fennel seeds were sourced from a spice market in Casablanca, Morocco, for essential oil extraction. The 100 g of plant materials were dried, ground into a fine powder, and extracted via hydrodistillation over a period of 4 h. All organic reagents and solvents used in this study were of analytical grade and were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), ensuring high purity and reliability for the experimental procedures. The extracted products were purified using column chromatography on silica gel, with hexane-ethyl acetate as the eluent. The gas chromatography was conducted with a Shimadzu 2010 GC coupled to a Shimadzu QP-2010 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) operating at an ionization voltage of 70 eV. The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 80 °C to 200 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, followed by a ramp to 280 °C at 15 °C/min, held for 5 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.27 mL/min and a linear velocity of 31.7 cm/s [ 17 2.2. Antibacterial Assays The antibacterial activity of three compounds against Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8 18 2.3. Microdilution Test The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the oils and their main compounds were determined using the microdilution method on 96-well plates, following standard protocols. Each well was filled with 50 µL of Mueller Hinton broth, and varying concentrations of the product dissolved in 10% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) were added. Then, 50 µL of a bacterial suspension, adjusted to 10 6 w v 19 For each microplate, the following control columns were included: A column containing Mueller Hinton medium and bacterial solution. A column containing Mueller Hinton medium, bacterial solution, and DMSO. A column containing only Mueller Hinton medium. 2.4. Statistical Analysis The student’s t p p p 20 2.5. Isolation of Eugenol and Estragole Clove bud essential oil underwent a chemical treatment procedure to extract eugenol.

ADMETox ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion), and drug-likeness of two ligands, eugenol and estragole, was performed using the PreADMET online platform ( https://preadmet.webservice.bmdrc.org Drug-likeness prediction was performed using several established in silico 21 22 For ADME prediction, we used in silico 23 Toxicity prediction was carried out using PreADMET’s toxicity module. In silico 24 25 2.8. Molecular Docking The chemical structures of the ligands, eugenol and estragole, were obtained from the PubChem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov https://www.rcsb.org Table 1 Initial preparation of the protein and ligand structures was conducted using Discovery Studio software. This involved the removal of water molecules, the addition of polar hydrogen atoms, and the assignment of Kuhlmann charges. The processed structures were then saved in PDBQT format for docking analysis. Docking simulations were carried out using AutoDockTools 1.5.6, which allowed for multiple docking runs to be performed efficiently. To ensure all potential ligand binding sites were thoroughly examined, the docking grid was set to cover the entire protein interaction region [ 26 3. Results 3.1. Chemical Part We carried out the extraction of clove bud essential oil using two hydrodistillation methods: simple hydrodistillation and Clevenger hydrodistillation, while maintaining the same quantity of cloves and extraction duration. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Table 2 Clove essential oil was examined by GC-MS. Four constituents accounting for 97.88% of the total oil were identified ( Figure 2 Table 3 The purification of the primary compound in clove essential oil was achieved via chemical treatment, resulting in a 96% purity yield as determined by gas chromatography. Eugenol was separated from the oil by converting it into eugenolate salt with the addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which made it soluble in the aqueous layer. The eugenolate was then hydrolyzed back to eugenol by adding sulfuric acid (H 2 4 1 13 supplementary Figure S1–S4 28 A Clevenger apparatus was utilized to prepare the fennel seeds for hydrodistillation, which is the method of essential oil extraction. The EO was extracted with a yield of 3%. The oil is a liquid that crystallizes around 4 °C, ranging from colorless to extremely light yellow, with a pronounced aniseed fragrance reminiscent of fennel. The EO was analyzed using GC-MS. The chromatogram showed three peaks for oxygenated monoterpenes: fenchone, anethole, and estragole. This investigation demonstrates that fennel seed essential oil is chemotyped, with estragole accounting for 93.30% ( Figure 3 Table 4 Estragole was extracted from fennel seed essential oil using column chromatography over silica gel and n-hexane/ethyl acetate combinations with a yield of 90%. Pure estragole was a colorless to yellowish liquid. It was thoroughly characterized using multiple spectroscopic techniques, including GC-MS, IR spectroscopy, 1 13 Figures S5–S8 3.2. Biological Part The results showed that each substance tested inhibited bacterial growth to varying degrees. Table 5 Table 6 S. aureus E. coli P. aeruginosa S. aureus E. coli P. aeruginosa S. aureus E. coli P. aeruginosa Table 5 S. aureus P. aeruginosa S. aureus P. aeruginosa E. coli Table 6 To determine whether the antibacterial effect is bactericidal (killing bacteria) or bacteriostatic (inhibiting bacterial growth), the MBC/MIC ratio is calculated. A ratio of ≤4 indicates a bactericidal effect, meaning the substance kills bacteria at a concentration close to that which inhibits growth, while a ratio > 4 suggests a bacteriostatic effect, where the substance inhibits bacterial growth at much lower concentrations than required to kill the bacteria. For example, eugenol exhibited an MBC/MIC ratio of 15.86 against S. aureus P. aeruginosa 3.3. In Silico Study 3.3.1. Drug-likeness Profiling Eugenol and estragole were evaluated for their drug-likeness using various in silico Table 7 3.3.2. ADME and Physicochemical Properties Both compounds exhibited high human intestinal absorption (HIA), with estragole reaching 100% and eugenol reaching 96.77%. Eugenol showed greater BBB permeability (2.26 vs. 1.51). MDCK permeability was significantly higher for eugenol, reflecting superior membrane permeability. Solubility was higher for eugenol in both buffer and water. Both compounds bind strongly to plasma proteins (100%) and are CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inhibitors, but not CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. Neither compound was a P-gp substrate or inhibitor, and skin permeability was within an acceptable range ( Table 8 3.3.3. Toxicity and Ecotoxicity Predictions Both compounds tested mutagenic in the Ames test and showed positive results in TA100 and TA1535 assays, indicating genotoxic potential. Carcinogenicity was observed in mice for both; however, only eugenol was carcinogenic in rats. Both had medium risk for hERG inhibition, suggesting moderate cardiotoxicity. Ecotoxicity results (algae, daphnia, medaka, minnow) showed low acute toxicity, with LC50 values in a similar range ( Table 9 3.3.4. Molecular Docking Scores Eugenol consistently demonstrated the highest binding energies (stronger affinities) than estragole across all bacterial proteins, with top scores of −7.8 kcal/mol for S. aureus P. aeruginosa Table 10 4. Discussion The aims of the present study are to evaluate the essential oils (EOs) chemical composition and antibacterial efficacy, extracted from clove buds ( Syzygium aromaticum Foeniculum vulgare We obtained clove EO via Clevenger-type hydrodistillation with a yield of 12%, and the major constituent was eugenol (68.51%), followed by β-caryophyllene, acetyleugenol, and caryophyllene oxide. The fennel seed EO had a low yield of 3% and was a chemotype oil dominated by estragole (93.30%). These results are in agreement with previous literature that reports high levels of eugenol in S. aromaticum F. vulgare 29 30 The antibacterial test revealed that both EOs and their isolated components were active against Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa S. aureus S. aureus E. coli P. aeruginosa 31 Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa 32 33 31 S. aureus E. coli P. aeruginosa 34 Estragole was also active, but it was weaker against bacteria, most notably P. aeruginosa 35 36 Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae Staphylococcus aureus Our results differ slightly from the literature, which can be significantly influenced by factors such as climate, soil conditions, and geographic location, all of which affect the types and concentrations of bioactive compounds in the oils. For instance, clove EOs from different regions have been reported to contain varying levels of eugenol, a key compound responsible for its antibacterial activity, depending on the local growing conditions. Similarly, fennel essential oil’s content of estragole or anethole, which plays a major role in its antimicrobial activity, can vary based on geographical factors. Moreover, extraction methods, such as steam distillation versus cold pressing, can also affect the yield and quality of essential oils, further influencing their antibacterial efficacy. These variations highlight the importance of considering environmental and methodological factors when interpreting the antibacterial potential of essential oils. An important observation is that the isolated compounds, eugenol and estragole, often show enhanced antibacterial activity relative to their crude essential oils. This phenomenon could be due to the presence of minor components within the oils that exert antagonistic or dilutive effects on the major active compounds, thereby reducing overall efficacy [ 37 31 Eugenol showed the strongest antibacterial activity among the tested compounds, with the lowest MIC and MBC values, particularly against S. aureus P. aeruginosa P. aeruginosa 38 39 S. aureus 40 41 S. aureus 42 43 E. coli P. aeruginosa 44 Furthermore, the data show that isolated compounds (eugenol and estragole) were generally more active than their respective essential oils. This suggests the presence of potential antagonistic interactions among EO constituents that may reduce the efficacy of the major components. Alternatively, some minor compounds may contribute to synergistic effects that enhance activity, as seen in the strong antibacterial effect of clove EO against P. aeruginosa 45 46 The in silico The ADME profiles of the compounds support their pharmacological potential. Eugenol has superior BBB penetration, MDCK permeability, and aqueous solubility, which could translate into better CNS access and formulation properties. Both compounds show high intestinal absorption and enzyme selectivity, but the absence of interactions is especially favorable for avoiding multidrug resistance. In terms of toxicity, the mutagenic and partially carcinogenic behavior of both molecules, particularly eugenol in rats, warrants caution. The moderate hERG inhibition risk must be addressed through chemical modification or dosage control to prevent cardiotoxic effects. However, their low aquatic toxicity highlights environmental safety at therapeutic levels. The ligand–protein interaction diagrams for the bacterial species E. coli S. aureus P. aeruginosa E. coli S. aureus P. aeruginosa Table 11 Several factors may account for the discrepancies between the in silico in vitro In vitro in vitro in silico in silico in vitro Overall, both compounds show valuable drug-like characteristics, with eugenol offering a slight advantage due to its better permeability, solubility, and binding interactions. However, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity risks must be carefully managed in future development steps. 5. Conclusions This study comprehensively investigated the antibacterial and pharmacokinetic potential of eugenol and estragole, the primary constituents of clove (68.51%) and fennel seed (93.30%) essential oils, respectively. Experimental analyses confirmed that both essential oils and their isolated compounds exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa S. aureus P. aeruginosa in silico Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cimb47090694/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.A., A.C. and M.D.; methodology, A.A., S.R. and F.E.M.; software, F.Z.K., A.E. and C.A.; validation, M.D. and A.A.; formal analysis, A.E.; investigation, B.N., A.C., V.B. and A.A.; resources, M.D., S.R., B.N. and A.C.; data curation, A.A. and F.Z.K.; writing—original draft preparation, A.A. and F.Z.K.; writing—review and editing, F.Z.K. and A.A.; visualization, A.A.; supervision, M.D. All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.
