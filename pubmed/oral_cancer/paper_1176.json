GA, a key component of SS, is known for its exfoliative properties. This study investigates SS’s effects on keratinocytes (HaCaT) and endothelial cells (ECs), comparing its properties to those of GA. HaCaT cell viability and cytotoxicity, ROS release, and inflammation-related signaling (PI3K/Akt/NF-κB and COX-2 gene expression) were assessed. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling was evaluated by gene expression of MMPs. In ECs, a preliminary evaluation of SS’s effect was conducted in terms of cell viability and migration. Results demonstrated that SS is well tolerated by keratinocytes whereas GA exhibits cytotoxicity, suggesting that SS’s natural composition mitigates GA’s adverse effects. SS induced a controlled, brief inflammatory response, via the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway, unlike GA, responsible for stronger and sustained pro-inflammatory events. Additionally, SS, through the upregulation of MMPs, contributes to ECM remodeling. In ECs, SS preserves viability and also enhances migration, thus supporting wound healing. These findings highlight SS’s ability to balance pro-inflammatory events, making it a promising candidate for advanced dermatological applications, underscoring SS’s potential in modulating key cellular signaling pathways, and supporting its future therapeutic prospects in wound healing.

Introduction Snail slime (SS), also referred to as snail mucus or snail mucin, is a complex viscoelastic fluid secreted by gastropod mollusks (e.g., Helix aspersa 1 2 3 4 5 SS has a complex composition, including water, the main component of SS, comprising up to 90–99.7% of its total weight [ 6 7 8 9 Each component contributes to the slime’s regenerative and protective properties. For instance, hyaluronic acid is a powerful humectant, drawing moisture to the skin and helping maintain hydration [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 Thanks to this unique combination of components, SS offers a powerful synergy of moisturizing, exfoliating, and healing effects; its components, in fact, work synergistically to promote skin regeneration, boost collagen production, and provide powerful antioxidant effects [ 16 The unique properties of SS have sparked interest in various fields, particularly biomedicine, pharmaceutical industries, and cosmetics, which are currently exploring and exploiting snail mucin for its moisturizing, anti-aging, and skin-repair properties [ 17 18 19 20 21 Human skin is composed of epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis is the outermost layer, primarily consisting of keratinocytes, while the lower dermis, with loose connective tissue with fibroblasts, contains blood vessels in which endothelial cells (ECs) are also represented. The epidermis is involved in skin regeneration by replacing the outer dead keratinocytes with new cells and the dermis supports wound healing by continuously remodeling the ECM and promoting new blood vessel formation [ 22 23 Inflammation, in fact, can be considered a defensive mechanism in response to any internal or external damage to the skin or body organ. Inflammation can be beneficial or harmful depending on the cause and duration. Chronic inflammation is harmful while acute or brief inflammation is a part of the immune response and can be helpful in many ways. For example, for injuries or wounds, the release of cytokines and recruitment of macrophages to clean the debris, followed by cell migration and re-epithelialization to the site of injury [ 24 In our previous study, we tested SS on fibroblasts and the results evidenced SS’s capability to promote fibroblast viability and to trigger recovery mechanisms by activating the Erk protein. Moreover, an appreciable anti-inflammatory effect due to the significant reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 expression (COX-2) and the positive modulation of new blood vessel formation demonstrated by increased Angiopoietin 1 gene expression and a higher matrix deposition (evidenced by the augmented amount of released collagen I) could be identified [ 20 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. SS Extraction Helix aspersa’s 2 6 20 2.2. Cell Culture A human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell line (catalog # T0020001), purchased from AddexBio (AddexBio, San Diego, CA, USA), and somatic hybrid ECs from the human umbilical vein (EA.hy926), purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CRL-2922 (p10), were both cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 2.3. Cell Treatments HaCaT cells were seeded at 25,000 cells/cm 2 After an overnight incubation, both HaCaT and EA.hy296 cells were treated with SS dilutions of 1:40 (0.508 mg/mL), 1:60 (0.31 mg/mL), and 1:80 (0.247 mg/mL) and GA dilutions of 4.1 mM (0.31 mg/mL), 2.73 mM (0.21 mg/mL), and 2.05 mM (0.15 mg/mL) in DMEM while the control was represented by cells only receiving potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate preservatives at 0.1% and sodium citrate at 10% in DMEM, to normalize the effect of stabilizers. These concentrations were chosen according to the results obtained in the previous paper [ 20 2.4. MTT Assay Cell viability in HaCaT cells was measured after 24 and 48 h of treatment in the presence of SS (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) and GA (4.1, 2.73, and 2.05 mM), while in EA.hy926 cells, it was measured after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with SS (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) and GA (4.1 mM), by an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy). After the prescribed time, the culture medium was removed and refed with 10% MTT (0.5 mg/mL) in DMEM (100 μL/well) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 2.5. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Cytotoxicity Assay Cytotoxicity was measured after 14 and 24 h of SS (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) and GA (4.1 mM, amount present in most concentrated dilution of SS (1:40)) treatment of HaCaT cells by using the CytoTox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). It worked by measuring the LDH leakage from cells after treatment with SS and GA. The experiment was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions and optical density (OD) was measured at 490 nm with a background absorbance of 690 nm. Measured LDH leakage was normalized with MTT OD values, as previously reported [ 25 2.6. Flow Cytometry Analysis of ROS Release HaCaT cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 180,000 cells per well and treated with SS (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) and GA (4.1, 2.73, and 2.05 mM) for 6 and 18 h. Following treatment, cells were incubated with 5 μM of 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and acetyl ester (CM-H 2 26 2 2.7. Western Blot Analysis HaCaT protein expression was measured after 14 and 24 or 48 h of treatment with SS (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) and GA (4.1 mM). Detached cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the cell pellet. RIPA buffer with freshly added protease inhibitors (sodium orthovanadate at 1 mM, leupeptin at 50 µg/mL, aprotinin at 10 µg/mL and PMSF (Phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride) at 100 µg/mL, Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy), was used to suspend the pellet. The suspended pellet was then centrifuged at 15,000× g 2.8. RNA Extraction HaCaT cells were collected from 6-well plates after 6 and 24 h of treatment and centrifuged at 1200 rpm to obtain cell pellets. The cells were lysed by 1% 2-mercaptoethanol lysis buffer followed by the addition of same volume of 70% ethanol ( v v ® ® ® ® 2.9. Reverse Transcription and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) A high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for reverse transcription. For each sample, 360 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed by mixing them in a 2X-RT master mix and incubating them in a thermal cycler (25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 120 min, and 85 °C for 5 min) to obtain cDNA. For assessing gene expression by quantitative PCR, the PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green 2X Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. The reaction volume (10 ng of cDNA, 1 µM of each forward and reverse primer, 10 µL of SYBR Green 2X Master Mix, and RNase free water to make up final volume of 20 µL) was transferred to a MicroAmp ® Table 1 The reaction plate was then loaded in QuantStudio 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the amplification method was set according to the instructions of the supplier: 50 °C and 95 °C each for 2 min, followed by the 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 60 s. QuantStudio™ Design and Analysis Software v1.5.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was employed for gene expression data analysis. Melt curve analysis confirmed the authenticity of the PCR products. Values of gene expression were normalized using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels. For each time point, the fold changes in target genes were calculated relative to GAPDH expression. Relative mRNA abundance was quantified using the comparative 2 −∆∆Ct 2.10. IL-6 Secretion ELISA Assay After 48 h of treatment with SS or GA, the amount of IL-6 released in the supernatants for each condition was detected by using an IL-6 ELISA kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at 450 nm (Varioskan™ LUX Multimode Microplate Reader, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The concentration of IL-6, expressed as pg/mL, was calculated thanks to an interpolation on the standard curve and then normalized on the MTT data. 2.11. Wound Healing Assay The wound healing assay was performed on EA.hy926 endothelial cells and HaCaT keratinocytes by the normal scratch method. A scratch was made in the center of each well using a 200 µL micropipette tip. Dead and scratched cells were washed with normal media (DMEM) and adherent cells were treated with SS (concentrations: 1:40, 1:60, 1:80) and GA (concentration: 4.1 mM) in DMEM while the control was obtained without SS. To specifically assess cell migration independently of proliferation, the scratch assay was performed in serum-free medium (FBS-free). Photos were taken using an inverted light microscope (Leica DMi1, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a camera, using Leica LAS EZ software (LAS EZ 3.4 DVD 272), at different time intervals (0 h and 18 h of treatment for endothelial cells and 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h for keratinocytes). The scratch distance and area were measured using Fiji imageJ 1.54f software. The percentage of cut reduction after treatment was then normalized to the cut at T0. 2.12. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v.8.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA) using one-way and two-way ANOVA (Analysis of variance) followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test. The data were presented as the mean ± SD (standard deviation), and p 3. Results 3.1. Assessment of HaCat Viability After SS and GA Treatment HaCaT viability was assessed using the MTT assay after 24 and 48 h of treatment with different concentrations of SS (1:40, 1:60, and 1:80) and of GA (4.1, 2.73, and 2.05 mM, the same concentrations as those present in SS) and compared to that of the untreated control. At both time points, SS-treated cells showed no significant differences in viability compared to the control. In contrast, GA-treated cells exhibited no significant change after 24 h; however, after 48 h, treatment with GA at 4.1 and 2.73 mM significantly reduced cell viability compared to that of the control, as illustrated in Figure 1 3.2. Evaluation of GA’s and SS’s Effects on HaCaT Cytotoxicity At both experimental time points (14 and 24 h), SS significantly reduced LDH release at all tested dilutions (1:40, 1:60, and 1:80) compared to both GA and the control ( Figure 2 3.3. Measurement of ROS Level After SS and GA Treatment To evaluate the effect of SS and GA treatments on ROS production, a flow cytometry analysis was performed using H2DCFDA-labeled HaCaT cells. After 6 h of treatment, 1:60 and 1:80 SS dilutions, as well as GA, significantly increased ROS levels compared to the control, while 1:40 dilution led to a reduction in ROS production. Interestingly, all SS-treated cells exhibited lower ROS levels compared to GA-treated cells ( Figure 3 Figure 3 3.4. Effect of SS and GA Treatment on PI3K/Akt/NF-κB Protein Levels The PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway is a key cascade activated in response to ROS generation during mild inflammatory states. Therefore, an evaluation of their protein expression levels was performed after 14 and 24 h of treatment with SS and GA. After 14 h, PI3K expression level significantly increases in all SS-treated groups (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) and in a GA-treated group (4.1 mM), compared to the control. However, a significant reduction was observed in 1:40 and 1:60 SS-treated samples compared to that in GA-treated cells. After 24 h, PI3K expression levels were significantly decreased in all SS- and GA-treated samples compared to those in the control. Notably, the 1:80 SS-treated sample showed a significant reduction compared to GA-treated cells, as shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 3.5. Assessment of Inflammatory Response In order to evaluate the inflammatory response of HaCaT cells after treatment with SS and GA, COX2 gene and protein expression was assessed. COX2 gene expression was analyzed after 6 and 24 h of treatment. After 6 h, all SS-treated samples showed a statistically significant decrease in COX2 gene expression compared to the control; moreover, 1:40 and 1:80 SS-treated samples showed a significant reduction in COX2 gene expression, also compared to GA-treated cells. After 24 h, GA-treated sample revealed a significant increase in COX2 gene expression with respect to the control while all the SS-treated samples (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) disclosed a significant reduction compared to GA-treated cells ( Figure 5 Figure 5 In order to consolidate these findings, a measurement of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 within the supernatant, after 48 h of treatment with SS and GA, was carried out by means of ELISA. The 1:60 condition produced a reduction statically significant with respect to both the control and GA ( Figure 5 3.6. Analysis of MMP Gene Expression in Response to SS and GA Treatment In order to investigate the effect of SS and GA on ECM remodeling, an evaluation of MMPs was conducted in HaCaT cells after 6 and 24 h of treatment. In particular, MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression was measured. After 6 h, 1:40 and 1:80 SS-treated samples showed a statistically significant increase in MMP-2 gene expression, with respect to the control and GA-treated cells. After 24 h, only the 1:80 SS-treated sample maintained a significantly higher level of MMP-2 compared to the GA-treated cells and control ( Figure 6 After 6 h, the 1:40 SS-treated sample disclosed an increased MMP-9 gene expression compared to the control and GA-treated cells, while after 24 h, the 1:40 and 1:80 SS- and GA-treated samples revealed a significant increase compared to the control ( Figure 6 3.7. Wound Healing Assessment in HaCaT Cells After SS and GA Treatment To investigate the effects of SS and GA on keratinocyte migration—a key step in epidermal regeneration—a wound healing assay was performed using HaCaT cells. A scratch was introduced in each well to simulate a wound, and baseline images were captured at 0 h. Cells were then treated with SS (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) or GA (4.1 mM), and wound closure was assessed after 24 and 48h h by comparing the residual wound area to the baseline area. Results demonstrated that SS promoted HaCaT cell migration in a dilution-dependent manner. After 24 h and 48 h of treatment, both the 1:40 and 1:80 SS dilutions showed a significantly higher percentage of wound closure compared to the control. Although GA treatment also led to a significant increase in wound closure after 48 h, its effect remained lower than that observed with the 1:40 SS dilution at both time points. ( Figure 7 3.8. Evaluation of Endothelial Cell Viability The percentage of metabolically active EA.hy926 cells was assessed using the MTT assay after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with SS and GA. After 24 h, cells exposed to the 1:40 SS dilution recorded a significant viability reduction compared to GA-treated cells, while the 1:60 dilution showed a significant increase in cell viability compared to GA-treated cells and the control. At 48 h, 1:40 and 1:60 treated-cells showed a significant increase in cell viability compared to GA-treated cells and the control. Notably, after 72 h, all the SS dilutions, 1:40, 1:60, and 1:80, recorded a significant improvement in cell viability with respect to GA-treated cells and the control ( Figure 8 3.9. Wound Healing Assessment in Endothelial Cells After SS and GA Treatments The wound healing assay was performed on endothelial EA.hy926 cells in order to investigate the migratory capability of the cells after SS and GA exposure. A scratch was made in each well of cultured cells and photos of the cut were taken before starting the treatment (0 h). After 18 h of treatment with SS and GA, photos were retaken to analyze cell migration by measuring the dimensions of the cut. Data was analyzed to estimate the percentage of wound closure after 18 h; results showed that all the SS dilutions (1:40, 1:60, 1:80) significantly improved the cell migration and filled the gap compared to GA, while a statistically significant reduction in wound closure is seen in GA-treated cells compared to the control ( Figure 9 4. Discussion SS has extensively been used for treating inflammation, burns, and other skin disorders since ancient times. Its traditional therapeutic applications have triggered researchers to make contributions to advancing and exploring the beneficial effects of this unique secretion. Researchers have been working to delve into the use of SS in cosmetics and sunscreen products [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Based on this knowledge, the present work aims at investigating three points: (I) an in-depth analysis of SS’s role on the outermost skin layer, represented by keratinocytes; (II) a comparative evaluation of GA, one of the main components of SS, when administered alone versus in its natural SS matrix, focusing on modulation of the pro-inflammatory response and ECM remodeling; (III) a preliminary evaluation of SS’s effect on EC viability and migration as a foundation for future in-depth investigation on deeper skin layers. Firstly, an evaluation of SS’s tolerance and cytotoxicity on keratinocytes, the primary skin cell population exposed to topical applications, was required. This evaluation was performed by administering SS and GA alone. The latter is widely recognized as an abundant component of SS, mainly responsible for peeling and gentle exfoliating effects, promoting cell turnover, when applied at low concentrations and for a short period of time [ 35 36 Keratinocytes undergo continuous regeneration and exfoliation. This process is essential for maintaining skin hydration and a youthful appearance, as it involves the shedding of dead cells and their replacement with newly formed cells [ 37 38 39 30 34 40 41 42 43 44 45 43 46 44 47 48 49 50 In healthy skin, keratinocytes coordinate with fibroblasts to regulate skin homeostasis, particularly regulating ECM remodeling. In a paracrine way, keratinocytes stimulate fibroblasts to release ECM remodeling factors; at the same time, they are able to drive ECM reshaping themselves, according to Pfisterer et al. [ 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 Although ROS play a crucial role in signaling pathways and physiological processes, particularly in tissue repair, ROS function as a “double-edged sword”, beneficial when controlled but harmful when sustained [ 60 After 18 h of treatment, ROS levels in all groups (SS, GA, and control) converged; this plateau suggests the activation of cellular compensatory mechanisms and restoration of redox homeostasis over time. The absence of sustained ROS accumulation, especially in SS-treated cells, reinforces the idea that SS does not induce persistent oxidative stress, which is critical for avoiding chronic inflammation and cellular damage. Overall, these findings highlight the redox-modulating properties of SS. Unlike GA, which triggers a stronger oxidative burst, SS induces a more controlled and transient ROS response that may support cellular activation without promoting prolonged oxidative damage. This behavior further emphasizes the potential of SS as a safer, well-tolerated alternative for skin regeneration therapies involving controlled oxidative stimuli. Keratinocyte migration is a critical step in the re-epithelialization phase of wound healing and skin regeneration [ 61 62 New blood vessel formation is a multistep and complex process, regulated by a tight balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors [ 63 64 65 66 67 5. Conclusions This study underlines that SS, due to its unique blend of multiple beneficial macromolecules, appears well tolerated by skin cells. SS in comparison to GA does not impart cytotoxic burden to skin cells, while the latter does. Similarly, SS induces well-controlled and regulated brief inflammation, helpful for cellular recovery processes, while GA induces inflammation immediately after administration and requires a longer time to become restored, suggesting that the complex composition of SS is able not only to attenuate the strong effect of GA but also to counteract inflammation and to maintain normal skin homeostasis. In addition, SS promotes transient and controlled cellular activation rather than prolonged damage. This balanced response is evidenced by the downregulation of COX-2 and IL-6, alongside a temporary rise in intracellular ROS levels, which may play a role in initiating key regenerative processes such as keratinocyte migration. Moreover, this paper underlines SS’s ability to effectively promote ECM remodeling by significantly raising MMP expression. A promising effect is also exerted on ECs populating the deeper layer of the skin, making SS suitable for tailored preparations. Therefore, considering the complexity of the wound healing process and the involvement of the different tissues, our results add one more piece of evidence in understanding the role of SS in skin regeneration, allowing us to admit that SS is a potent agent in regulating cellular signaling pathways, and opens up future avenues for its potential use in wound healing. While our work provides mechanistic insights through in vitro assays, future studies employing animal models will be essential to validate these findings and assess wound closure dynamics, granulation tissue formation, and collagen deposition, thereby strengthening translational relevance. This positions our findings as a foundation for forthcoming translational research.
