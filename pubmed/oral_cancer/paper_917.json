In dogs, visceral hemangiosarcoma offers a relevant spontaneous model for evaluating novel therapies. Surgery alone yields a median survival of 1–3 months, and treatment with doxorubicin (DOX), alone or in combination (e.g., with propranolol), modestly extends median survival time to 5–7 months, with a 1-year survival of around 10%. We developed a conjugate vaccine technology, called immune Boost (iBoost), and hypothesized that combining DOX with an iBoost vaccine targeting extracellular vimentin (eVim) could improve survival without added toxicity. Twenty-three dogs with visceral hemangiosarcoma received six cycles of DOX every two weeks post-splenectomy, alongside four doses every other week of eVim iBoost immunotherapy, followed by maintenance vaccinations every two months. Outcomes were compared to historical controls treated with DOX alone. Compared to the control group the median overall survival time increased from 136 to 235 days (NS), restricted mean survival time at one year increased with 81 days ( p p angiogenesis sarcoma angiosarcoma hemangiosarcoma immunotherapy soft tissue tumour vaccine canine study EU Eurostars project SimPro E!5706 Dutch Cancer Society KWF-2022-4 EXPL/14815 The research was funded by the EU Eurostars project SimPro (E!5706) and a grant from the Dutch Cancer Society (KWF-2022-4 EXPL/14815). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Angiosarcoma (AS) represents a rare and aggressive subclass of soft tissue sarcoma, characterized by endothelial differentiation, typically seen in elderly patients [ 1 2 3 4 5 1 6 7 For HSA, a more prevalent tumour in dogs, more extensive research has been conducted [ 8 9 10 11 12 Alternative therapies, including single agents or combinations with DOX, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carboplatin, dacarbazine and toceranib, have been explored but results were modest and inconsistent, offering no clear therapeutic advantage over single agents alone [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ® 21 22 23 Despite decades of research, treatment options for AS and HSA remain very limited, underscoring the need for new therapeutic targets and strategies [ 24 25 26 27 28 29 A promising target that has recently gained attention in the context of immunotherapy is extracellular vimentin (eVim), which is secreted by tumour endothelial cells in the majority of solid tumours [ 30 31 30 32 33 In this study, we investigated the safety and therapeutic potential of combining the eVim iBoost vaccine with standard treatment using DOX, with or without propranolol, in dogs with spontaneous visceral HSA. We hypothesized that combining the vimentin-targeting vaccine with DOX would stimulate a robust anti-vimentin antibody response and produces improved survival outcomes over treatment with DOX alone. 2. Results 2.1. Study Population Twenty-four dogs with histopathology-confirmed hemangiosarcoma (HSA, Figure 1 14 Table 1 2.2. Immunohistochemical Analysis Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate the expression of ERG (ETS-related gene), a marker used in the human clinic to confirm angiosarcoma. In concordance with observations in human AS, the dog tissues demonstrated specific and abundant overexpression of ERG in the vast majority of cancer cells ( Figure 1 Figure 1 34 Figure 1 2.3. Vaccination and Antibody Responses A study was performed in dogs with HSA using the canine version of the eVim vaccine. Dogs enrolled in the study received a vaccination schedule consisting of four induction doses administered at two-week intervals ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Notably, there was considerable inter-individual variability in antibody titers among the different dogs, a phenomenon commonly observed in outbred populations. The route of vaccine administration, i.e., subcutaneous (s.c.) versus intramuscular (i.m.) injections, did not significantly impact the magnitude of the antibody response, as comparable titers were seen in both groups ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Antibody responses in dogs receiving eVim alone or sequentially after DOX were similar to those observed in the dogs receiving concomitant DOX and vaccine, suggesting that prior or concurrent chemotherapy did not impair the development of a vaccine-induced immune response. These results confirm that the iBoost eVim vaccine is highly immunogenic in dogs with HSA, independent of sex, administration route, or chemotherapy status. The strong antibody responses across treatment groups further support investigation of the vaccine’s therapeutic potential in canine HSA. 2.4. Clinical Outcome At the end of the follow-up period, one dog originally diagnosed with stage II HSA remained alive and progression-free, with a follow-up time of 1119 days. Of the remaining 22 dogs, 19 dogs were euthanised and three dogs died spontaneously, all due to suspected or confirmed progressive disease. One dog with stage I HSA developed liver metastases at day 128 but ultimately died because of a torsion of the mesentery at day 446, an event unrelated to tumor burden. The overall median progression free interval (PFI) for the cohort was 142 days (range 24–1119) and median overall survival time (OS) for all clinical stages was 168 days (range 34–1119, Figure 3 Figure 3 Table 2 Figure 3 p Figure 4 Importantly, the 1-year survival significantly increased significantly ( p Table 2 Figure 3 p Figure 3 Figure 3 These findings suggest that the dog eVim vaccine, even in the context of advanced disease, can induce durable clinical benefit in a subset of patients and may significantly improve long-term survival outcomes in canine HSA. 2.5. Safety and Tolerability The vaccination and combination treatment regimens were well-tolerated across the study population. Adverse events were limited to grade 1 and 2 toxicities, in all but one dog, primarily consisting of local injection site reactions, and mild transient vaccination-related clinical signs, such as lethargy and fatigue. These events were self-limiting and required no medical intervention in most cases. One dog showed grade 3 vomiting and grade 4 neutropenia which were attributed to concomitant DOX treatment rather than the vaccine itself ( Table 3 Overall, the safety profile of the iBoost eVim vaccine, both as monotherapy and in combination with DOX, was favorable and consistent with expectations for a therapeutic cancer vaccine and DOX treatment. The manageable and transient nature of the observed adverse events supports the continued clinical development of this approach in canine HSA. 3. Discussion In this study, we tested a new cancer vaccine directed against extracellular vimentin (eVim) in client-owned dogs with visceral hemangiosarcoma (HSA). In this study we combined the vaccine with adjuvant doxorubicin (DOX) therapy after splenectomy. The data were compared to a historical control group receiving DOX only [ 14 p p Angiosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma of endothelial origin that is rare in humans, but more commonly observed in dogs, where it is referred to as HSA. Despite differences in incidence, angiosarcomas in both species share significant genetic and histopathological similarities. In both humans and dogs, treatment options beyond surgical resection are limited and generally ineffective. In humans, there is no conclusive evidence supporting the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy; it has been suggested that biologically targeted therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, and preferably anti-angiogenic agents may offer better options [ 35 36 9 2 The vaccine used in this study has been designed to induce high antibody titers to the self-antigen extracellular vimentin (eVim). This was achieved using the conjugate vaccine technology immune Boost (iBoost) was specifically developed for this purpose [ 31 A key outcome of this study was an observed improvement in median OST, which was nearly doubled compared to controls. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Notably, five dogs enrolled in the study received the vaccine as a monotherapy and therefore did not benefit from the additional survival advantage conferred by DOX treatment, estimated as an additional 136 days of survival. The median OS as presented in Figure 3 Figure 3 Table 2 Recent studies have identified propranolol as a potential anti-cancer agent, including in sarcomas. This interest stems from observation made in infantile hemangioma, where treatment resulted in significant inhibition of hemangioma growth [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 The current has several other limitations. First, the study is an open-label single-arm prospective clinical study, that makes use of a historical control group for comparison. This may introduce temporal differences in the treatment of these dogs. However, adjuvant treatment and dose regimen with DOX remained unchanged as the care for dogs with hemangiosarcoma for decades, making it unlikely that temporal differences play a role. Second, next to the abovementioned group that received vaccination only, we also included a group of three dogs that received sequential vaccination after DOX. The latter group did not present a longer median OST (207 days). Therefore, we left this group in the analysis. Taken together, these findings support further development of eVim-targeted vaccination strategies, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. Future studies should include larger, prospective cohorts to validate the survival benefit. Additionally, biomarker-driven patient stratification and integration of complementary immunomodulatory strategies, such as immune checkpoint blockade or agents targeting tumor vasculature, could further enhance therapeutic outcomes. Given the translational relevance of canine HSA to human angiosarcoma, these results also warrant exploration of this vaccine approach in human clinical settings. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Study Design and Participants An open-label single-arm prospective clinical study in privately owned dogs was performed following approval by the Animal Ethics Committee of the VU University and the national Central Authority for Scientific Procedures on Animals (reg. no. CCDAVD11400202011305, 15 December 2020). The study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of adjuvant dog eVim vaccine in combination with the maximal tolerated dose DOX in dogs with visceral HSA. Propranolol was allowed to be added to the adjuvant treatment per the treating veterinarian’s discretion. Owners who refused to have their dogs treated with chemotherapy were offered adjuvant dog eVim vaccine alone. Dogs with suspected HSA were completely staged with Thoracic radiographs, cardiac- and abdominal ultrasound, complete blood count and biochemistry profile before surgical intervention. Only dogs with histologically confirmed HSA by board certified veterinary pathologists were eligible. Dogs with suspected cardiac disorders, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, or recent (two weeks before first vaccination) or current treatment with immunosuppressive therapy for other diseases and/or prior malignancies were excluded per the principal investigator’s discretion. Upon written owner consent, dogs were included in the study; these dogs were not hospitalised and lived at home with their owners. After the initial vaccination, the dogs received three booster vaccinations at 2-week intervals, followed by maintenance vaccinations at 2-month intervals for the duration of the study. Initially, vaccinations were given subcutaneously (s.c., n = 12) in the groin. Feedback from the previous study in urothelial carcinoma indicated that an intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination would be preferred over the s.c. one for two reasons: first owners typically worried about the induration/ulceration seen in up to 50% of the dogs at the injection site and secondly veterinarians considered an i.m. vaccination a more patient friendly way of application. An animal safety study was performed and showed that the i.m. vaccination generated robust antibody titers and was safe (unpublished results). Subsequently, the route of administration was switched to i.m. (n = 11) in the upper leg. The dog eVim vaccine was composed of 500 μg recombinant fusion protein TRXtr-dogVimentin (TRXtr-dVim) (canis lupus familiaris, NCBI ref seq NM_001287023.1 The DOX treatment regimen consisted of 6 doses of 30 mg/m 2 2 Figure 1 4.2. Immune Response Measurement Tissue morphology of HSA tissues was visualised by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to evaluate ERG, CD45, and vimentin expression. Protocols were used as described before [ 33 47 33 4.3. Anti-eVim Antibody ELISA Antibody titers were measured in duplicate in 96-well ELISA plates (F96 Maxisorp, Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) coated with 4 µg/mL recombinant dog vimentin protein and subsequently blocked with 4% milk/PBS (100 µL/well) (sc-2325, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), both for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were incubated with biotinylated polyclonal goat anti-canine IgG (6070-08, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA, 0.25 µg/mL) for 45 min at 37 °C and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (P0397, Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA, 0.45 mg/mL) for 30 min. Plates were developed and measured as previously published [ 33 4.4. Patient Monitoring and Evaluation Dogs were re-assessed at each visit according to the treatment schedule ( Figure 2 48 49 4.5.
