However, this biocultural heritage remains insufficiently documented and is increasingly threatened by human’s economic activities, rapid globalization, climate change, and generational knowledge loss. This study aimed to record MFPs, evaluate their cultural and ecological relevance, and assess their conservation challenges. Methods Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in 2012 and 2017 across Altay Prefecture. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 100 key informants, including traditional healers, herders, and merchants, complemented by focal group discussions, field observations, and voucher specimen collection. Voucher specimens were deposited at the Herbarium of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine (XJNM). Use-value (UV) index was calculated to assess the relative importance of each species. Traditional knowledge, edible applications, and sustainability concerns were systematically documented. Results A total of 118 MFP species were identified, belonging to 37 families and 85 genera. Rosaceae (12.7%), Asteraceae (7.6%), Polygonaceae (7.6%) and Fabaceae (7.6%) were the most represented families. Herbaceous plants dominated (69.5%), with fruits (33.9%) and roots (20.3%) being the primary edible parts. Species with the highest medicinal UV included Glycyrrhiza uralensis Taraxacum officinale Codonopsis pilosula Conclusions Kazakh MFPs represent a culturally integrated “medicine-food continuum” intricately adapted to local ecological conditions. Sustainable utilization requires the incorporation of traditional knowledge—such as phenology-informed harvesting practices—into conservation strategies, the promotion of community-led cultivation of vulnerable species, and the documentation of associated cultural practices. Given accelerating environmental and sociocultural shifts, urgent efforts are needed to preserve this fragile biocultural heritage.

Such plants have been explored for their therapeutic potential in managing diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and obesity [ 5 7 8 10 China is among the world’s most biodiverse countries, particularly in terms of medicinal flora [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Globally, ethnobotanical studies have consistently highlighted the profound link between biodiversity, cultural diversity, and traditional knowledge systems. Research among pastoral and indigenous communities, from the Daur in Inner Mongolia to the Afar in Ethiopia, underscores how such knowledge is intricately adapted to local ecologies and is increasingly recognized for its potential contributions to food security, nutrition, and community health [ 18 19 20 21 The Altay Mountains in northern Xinjiang host a diverse range of habitats and are home to Kazakh nomadic pastoralists, whose cultural and economic survival is closely tied to local biodiversity. For centuries, they have relied on plants for food, healing, and cultural expression. However, their traditional knowledge is rapidly being undermined by globalization, climate variability, and shifting land-use patterns. Despite the critical role of medicinal food plants in Kazakh life, systematic documentation remains scarce. Furthermore, comparative studies are essential not only for assessing the novelty of reports but also for understanding the dynamics of traditional knowledge systems and identifying core elements of nomadic plant use [ 19 20 20 23 As demonstrated in studies of other ethnic groups in China, such as the Hakka people in Guangxi [ 22 19 Methods Study area The study was conducted in Altay Prefecture, located in northern Xinjiang at the southern areas of the Altay Mountains and the northern edge of the Junggar Basin, spanning coordinates 85°31′73″–91°01′15″ E and 45°00′00″–49°10′45″ N [ 24 25 26 27 The study area included one county-level city and six counties: Altay City, Burqin County, Habahe County, Jeminay County, Fuhai County, Fuyun County, and Qinghe County (Fig. 1 1 Fig. 1 Study site. a b c Table 1 Characterization of the study sites and informant profiles in Altay Prefecture County/City Representative Village Latitude (N) Longitude (E) Altitude (m) Dominant Ethnicity No. of Informants Age Range Gender (M/F) Occupation (Herders/Healers/Merchants/Others) Altay City Lasite Township 47°52′25.25’’ 88°7′29.74’’ 850–1100 Kazakh 15 < 30 (1), 31–50 (5), 51–60 (6), > 60 (3) 11/4 6 / 3 / 2 / 4 Burqin County Hemu Hanas Township 48°34′15.96’’ 87°26′24.51’’ 1100–1400 Kazakh 16 < 30 (2), 31–50 (6), 51–60 (5), > 60 (3) 12/4 7 / 3 / 3 / 3 Habahe County Tereke Township 48°28′31.08’’ 86°42′4.15’’ 600–900 Kazakh 14 < 30 (1), 31–50 (5), 51–60 (5), > 60 (3) 11/3 7 / 2 / 1 / 4 Jeminay County Jeminay Town 47°29′45.65’’ 85°37′19.76’’ 900–1200 Kazakh 14 < 30 (1), 31–50 (6), 51–60 (4), > 60 (3) 11/3 5 / 4 / 3 / 2 Fuhai County Fuhai Town 47°6′34.25’’ 87°29′8.91’’ 500–800 Kazakh 14 < 30 (1), 31–50 (5), 51–60 (5), > 60 (3) 11/3 6 / 3 / 2 / 3 Fuyun County Tiemaike Township 47°13′25.79’’ 89°44′37.86’’ 1200–1500 Kazakh 14 < 30 (1), 31–50 (5), 51–60 (5), > 60 (3) 11/3 4 / 5 / 1 / 4 Qinghe County A'ale Town 46°44′46.32’’ 90°19′36.56’’ 1100–1300 Kazakh 13 < 30 (2), 31–50 (7), 51–60 (3), > 60 (1) 9/4 6 / 3 / 3 / 1 Total 100 < 30 (9), 31–50 (39), 51–60 (33), > 60 (19) 76/24 41/23/15/ 21 Data collection Resource survey and sample collection In 2012 and 2017, a multidisciplinary team comprising ethnobotanists, taxonomists, and local Kazakh collaborators conducted systematic resource surveys across Kazakh-inhabited areas of Xinjiang. A combination of plot-based sampling and transect surveys was employed to ensure comprehensive documentation of species distribution. Field investigations included the collection of diverse MFPs (Fig. 2 Pinus sibirica Fig. 2 Parts of plants used in Kazakh medicine at study area ( A Pinus sibirica B Hippophae rhamnoides mongolica C Vaccinium vitis-idaea D Polygonum alpinum E Trollius altaicus F Grossularia acicularis G Origanum vulgare H Ziziphora clinopodioides I Rhaponticum carthamoides Ethnobotanical interviews A total of 100 informants participated in the study, including 23 traditional healers, 41 herders, 15 merchants, and 21 others. Of these, 52% were aged 50–80, and 39% were aged 30–50 (Table 1 Data collection on frequently used MFPs To gain deeper insights into frequently used MFPs, data were collected from two sources: (1) primary fieldwork—including interviews, focus groups, and direct observation—and (2) a review of relevant literature and ethnobotanical records [ 28 To ensure the reliability of data and community representation, key informants were identified in consultation with village leaders and community elders. Six focus group discussions were held in different Kazakh-populated villages, facilitated by traditional healers, plant collectors, and senior community members. These sessions focused on themes such as MFP diversity, seasonal availability, culinary integration, medicinal application, cultural symbolism, and challenges to knowledge transmission. Field observations supplemented these discussions by documenting real-time plant collection, preparation, and seasonal use. All research activities prioritized ethical engagement, cultural respect, and the protection of traditional knowledge and intellectual property rights. Data analysis Collected data were compiled into a comprehensive inventory listing all identified MFP species along with their botanical, ecological, and ethnomedicinal information. To quantify the significance of each species, we calculated the UV, a common ethnobotanical index reflecting the relative importance of each plant to the community. The UV was computed using the formula: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$UV = \\, \\left( {\\Sigma Ui} \\right){/}N$$\\end{document} U V = Σ U i / N 29 Results Sociodemographic characteristics of study participants A total of 100 individuals participated in the MFP use surveys, which included semi-structured interviews and six focus group discussions. Participants were categorized by age into the following groups: < 30 years, 31–40 years, 41–50 years, 51–60 years, and > 60 years. The majority of informants were concentrated in the 51–60 (37%), 41–50 (29%), and 31–40 (10%) age ranges. This distribution reflects the demographic most actively engaged in the use and transmission of traditional medicinal knowledge. In contrast, younger individuals (< 30 years, 9%) and the elderly (> 60 years, 15%) were less represented, indicating potential vulnerabilities in intergenerational knowledge transfer. Traditional plant diversity and medicinal-edible plants (MFPs) Utilization by the Kazakh ethnic group Botanical diversity survey overview Between 2012 and 2024, a systematic survey of medicinal plant resources was conducted across the Altay region, documenting a total of 12,225 medicinal plant species. Against this broad botanical backdrop, the present study specifically focuses on 118 medicinal plants that are traditionally used by the Kazakh people for both food and medicine, with field research and data collection carried out primarily in 2012 and 2017. This narrower scope highlights the Kazakh community’s profound ethnobotanical knowledge in the domain of MFPs integrative practices. Composition and characteristics of MFPs From this total, 118 species were specifically identified as MFPs, distributed across 37 families and 85 genera (Table 1 (1). Dominant families included Rosaceae (15 species, 12.71%), Fabaceae (9 species, 7.62%), Asteraceae (9 species, 7.62%), Polygonaceae (9 species, 7.62%), and Umbelliferae (7 species, 5.93%). (2). Moderately diverse families comprised Elaeagnaceae (5 species, 4.24%), Campanulaceae (4 species, 3.39%), Saxifragaceae (4 species, 3.39%), and Caprifoliaceae and Urticaceae (3 species each, 2.54%). (3). Minor families (30 families) were represented by 1–2 species each (≤ 1.69%), including Ranunculaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Brassicaceae, Linaceae, Iridaceae, and Amaranthaceae. Plant life forms and utilization patterns Herbaceous plants dominated the MFPs (82 species, 69.5%), followed by shrubs (24 species, 20.3%) and trees (12 species, 10.2%). Although most MFPs were historically wild-harvested, increasing demand has led to the cultivation of 30.51% of these species, highlighting a growing shift toward sustainable use. The Kazakh community utilizes different plant parts for both medicinal and dietary purposes, with notable divergence between therapeutic and nutritional applications. Medicinal uses most frequently involved roots (25.42%), leaves (22.03%), and whole plants (18.64%), collectively comprising over 70% of medicinal usage. In contrast, fruits (33.90%) were the dominant part used in dietary applications, followed by leaves (20.34%) and roots (20.34%) (Fig. 3 2 Fig. 3 The statistics of the used parts for MFPs of Kazakh ethnic group Table 2 List of ethnomedicinal plants commonly used by the Kazakh people in Altay, Xinjiang Voucher number Scientific name Local name Family A) Medicinal Uses and B) Preparation Food uses Food part used Medicinal part used Taxonomic Habit UV 654324240908001LY Pinus sibirica 巴勒哈拉盖 Pinaceae A) Nourish Yin and moisten lungs B) Appropriate amount of resin for external use or chewing Eating dried seeds (pine nuts) Seed Seed Tree Wi 0.17 654323170812052LY Betula pendula 阿合海英 Betulaceae A) Detoxifying, Heat-clearing and dampness-removing B) The bark can be used externally after being ground Drinking as beverage Secretion Bark Tree Wi 0.03 180,812,022 Morus nigra 哈拉图特 Moraceae A) Dispelling wind-heat, clearing liver and improving vision B) Decocting with water Eating dried or fresh fruits Fruit Fruit, leaf Tree Cu 0.04 190,614,004 Morus alba 阿克图特 Moraceae A) Dispelling wind-heat, clearing liver and improving vision B) Decocting with water Eating dried or fresh fruits Fruit Fruit, leaf Tree Cu 0.04 654301170808030LY Humulus lupulus 胡勒麻柯 Cannabaceae A) Strengthening stomach, aiding digestion B) Decocting with water Brewing for beer-making Fruit Fruit Herb Cu 0.08 150,725,023 Urtica urens 合什麻 Urticaceae A) Detoxifying, dispelling wind B) External application after crushing Vegetable salad Leaf Whole plant Herb Wi 0.07 654325170706017LY Urtica cannabina 夏克帕削普 Urticaceae A) Detoxifying, dispelling wind B) Decocting with water, external use, pounding Vegetable salad Leaf Whole plant Herb Wi 0.02 654323170804066LY Urtica dioica 喀拉卡伊 Urticaceae A) Detoxifying, dispelling wind B) Decocting with water used for fumigating and washing the affected area Vegetable salad Leaf Whole plant Herb Wi 0.04 654301170708055LY Rheum compactum 杰别巴斯绕哈什 Polygonaceae A) Laxative or astringent B) Decocting with water Vegetable Leaf, Stem Rhizome Herb Wi 0.14 B0188 Rheum altaicum 阿勒泰绕哈什 Polygonaceae A) Indigestion, chronic constipation B) Decocting with water Making candied fruit or brewing wine Leaf, Stem Rhizome Herb Wi 0.06 240,629,002 Rheum wittrockii 天山绕哈什 Polygonaceae A) Laxative or astringent B) Decocting with water Vegetable Leaf, Stem Rhizome Herb Wi 0.14 654323170710008LY(A) Rumex acetosa 合么孜德克 Polygonaceae A) Heat-clearing and detoxifying B) Pounding fresh parts to extract juice for external application, or grinding dried roots with vinegar to make juice for smearing on the affected area Vegetable Leaf Root, whole plant Herb Wi 0.04 654301170806015LY Rumex thyrsiflorus 提克塔米尔克米孜德克 Polygonaceae A) Heat-clearing and dampness-removing B) Pounding fresh parts to extract juice for external application, or grinding dried roots with vinegar to make juice for smearing on the affected area Vegetable Leaf Root Herb Wi 0.04 654301170623010LY Rumex crispus 阿特胡拉合合么孜德克 Polygonaceae A) Heat-clearing and blood-cooling B) Pounding fresh parts to extract juice for external application, or grinding dried roots with vinegar to make juice for smearing on the affected area Vegetable Leaf Root Herb Wi 0.04 B0035 Rumex confertus 结伊乌萨亭克米孜德克 Polygonaceae A) Astringent, hemostatic B) Pounding fresh parts to extract juice for external application, or grinding dried roots with vinegar to make juice for smearing on the affected area Eating stems and seeds as food substitute Stem, Seed Root, Seed Herb Wi 0.04 654301170809007LY Bistorta officinalis 杰尔霍纳克 Polygonaceae A) Heat-clearing and detoxifying B) Taken orally in the form of pills or powders;

This includes traditional treatment strategies such as “Clearing Heat and Detoxifying” (used for furuncles, dysentery, and sore throat) and “Relieving Cough and Asthma” (applied in bronchitis and chronic cough), which employ plants with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and expectorant properties. Urinary, nervous, and trauma-related treatments formed additional key application areas. Plants used for the urinary system (8.40%) were often associated with diuretic and anti-edema effects, aligned with the traditional category of “Promoting Diuresis and Removing Dampness.” Nervous system applications (11.86%) included therapies for stress-related ailments and insomnia. Treatments addressing musculoskeletal (4.20%) and circulatory disorders, often linked to trauma or menstruation, fell under the concept of “Activating Blood Circulation.” Reproductive and metabolic health were addressed through applications targeting the reproductive system (6.78%) and tonification of liver and kidney functions, utilizing adaptogenic herbs for conditions such as impotence and renal fatigue. Other applications included seasonal and symptomatic relief, such as “Relieving Exterior Syndrome” for colds and fever, “Stopping Bleeding” for hemorrhagic conditions, and “Calming Liver Wind” for neurological or cardiovascular symptoms, such as hypertension-induced headaches. Although less represented individually, these categories reflect a nuanced understanding of health within Kazakh ethnomedicine. Together, these findings highlight the sophistication and contextual adaptation of Kazakh MFP-based therapies, demonstrating their alignment with both ecological realities and the specific health needs of pastoral-nomadic life. Kazakh knowledge and dietary use of MFPs The Kazakh population of the Altay region maintains a predominantly nomadic lifestyle, grazing livestock year-round on natural grasslands. Their traditional diet is centered around meat and dairy products, supplemented by wild plants collected during seasonal migrations to enhance vitamin intake and diversify nutritional sources. Based on ethnobotanical research and compilation, Kazakh wild edible plants can be broadly categorized into fruits, vegetables, beverages, and dietary therapies (Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Edible category of MFPs Field investigations revealed that fruit consumption is especially prevalent. Wild fruits such as black tea thistle, alpine tea thistle, and Altai blackcurrant are often eaten fresh or processed into jams for preservation. Taraxacum mongolicum 35 Additionally, wild plants play a significant role in traditional beverages. For instance, Niuzhi was historically a luxury tea reserved for Kazakh nobility but has since become a widespread and culturally significant herbal drink. Some plants also serve functional roles in food preparation, such as using horsehair to ferment camel milk and other dairy products [ 36 These diverse uses highlight the centrality of plants in Kazakh food culture, not only as ingredients but as regulators of dietary systems. The accumulation of practical knowledge over generations has produced a sophisticated understanding of edible plants that merits protection and documentation. During fieldwork, herders frequently emphasized the importance of phenological cues, such as flowering and fruiting periods, in harvesting practices. This reflects a strong ecological awareness and deep respect for nature’s rhythms, underscoring the Kazakh people’s integration of traditional ecological knowledge into everyday subsistence. Cultural significance of MFPs in Kazakh ethnobotany Over centuries of coexistence with their environment, the Kazakh people have integrated the use of MFPs into their cultural, spiritual, and ecological traditions, forming a unique body of ethnobotanical knowledge (Table 3 Hippophae rhamnoides Rosa multiflora Urtica fissa Table 3 Five traditional Kazakh MFPs: Culinary, therapeutic, and cultural practices Plant Name Medicinal and Culinary Uses Cultural/Symbolic Practices Peganum Harmala Seeds (controlled dosage) for pain relief; boiled leaves for skin infections Spring migration: spraying livestock with Peganum water for hygiene purposes Ferula assa-foetida Resin for wound; mixed with sheep fat (diluted) to promote lactation Used in postpartum care and emergency wound treatment Allium chrysanthum Juice for ear infections; raw consumption for digestion Dietary use in bread-making to balance nutrition Cistanche deserticola Stewed with mutton for kidney health; medicinal wine for stamina Traditional tonic for physical strength Erythronium sibiricum Boiled with milk for convalescents; stir-fried with fat for children’s growth Dietary supplement for immunity and recovery Kazakh plant use is guided by ecological ethics and traditional taboos rooted in environmental observation. For instance, Allium ramosum Allium chrysanthum Rosa multiflora Peganum harmala 30 32 33 Remarkably, these cultural practices align with modern pharmacological findings. Scientific studies have confirmed the antioxidant properties of Hippophae rhamnoides Glycyrrhiza uralensis MFPs in Kazakh culture serve not only as food and medicine but as conduits of identity, memory, and environmental ethics. Their use reflects the Kazakh worldview of harmony between humans and nature. While some traditional practices—such as the commercialization of sea buckthorn oil—have entered modern markets through cultural tourism, core knowledge continues to be transmitted orally by elders. This living heritage requires both scientific engagement and cultural sensitivity to safeguard its continuity, ensuring that the ecological wisdom and cultural integrity of Kazakh MFP use are preserved for future generations. Discussion Regional variations in traditional knowledge of MFPs This study systematically documents the Kazakh ethnic group’s use of 118 MFPs in Altay, Xinjiang, illustrating the deeply rooted concept of “medicine and food from the same source” in their traditional healthcare system. Compared to other Chinese ethnic minorities, such as the Daur [ 19 Hippophae rhamnoides Glycyrrhiza uralensis 25 30 31 Integration of medicinal and dietary functions Kazakh MFP practices embody a traditional ecological medical worldview that emphasizes the unity of food and medicine. The study found that 68.2% of recorded species serve dual roles in diet and therapy. For example, Ziziphora clinopodioides Taraxacum officinale 37 32 38 The Kazakh MFPs in a cross-cultural perspective Our study documents a rich and diverse biocultural heritage of medicinal food plants (MFPs) among the Kazakh people in Altay. When viewed in a cross-cultural lens, the Kazakh MFP system reveals both significant commonalities with other global pastoral traditions and distinctive features shaped by its unique ecological and cultural context. A key commonality lies in the adaptive selection of plant families and parts. The predominance of Rosaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae species and the preference for nutrient-dense fruits and roots are convergent strategies also observed among the Daur people of Inner Mongolia and Mongolian herders [ 19 39 However, the Kazakh system is distinguished by its remarkable sophistication and specificity. The precise dosage control of Peganum harmala 23 Erythronium sibiricum 18 19 The sheer diversity of MFPs documented (118 species) exceeds that of many comparable studies (e.g., 52 species in the Daur, 106 in the Afar [ 18 19 18 21 Sustainable use and emerging challenges Kazakh MFPs hold significant promise for nutraceutical development. Plants like Hippophae rhamnoides 40 Codonopsis pilosula 41 Ribes nigrum Glycyrrhiza uralensis Hippophae rhamnoides Rhodiola rosea 42 18 21 18 21 Allium 20 23 33 Allium 43 Limitations and future directions While this study offers a comprehensive ethnobotanical inventory of Kazakh MFPs in Altay, several limitations should be acknowledged to guide future research. Our study primarily focused on the Kazakh ethnic group. Although some cross-cultural comparisons with other nomadic groups were initiated, they were not extensive enough to include a broader range of co-resident ethnicities within the prefecture (e.g., Mongolians, Han Chinese) or Kazakh communities in other major pastoral regions like Ili. Second, our investigation was conducted in key Kazakh-inhabited villages across all seven counties of Altay Prefecture to ensure a representative overview. However, this approach did not achieve a full-coverage survey of every Kazakh community. Future studies should prioritize the phytochemical and pharmacological validation of the most cited MFPs to substantiate their efficacy and safety. Furthermore, longitudinal studies are critical to quantitatively evaluate the rate of traditional knowledge erosion and the impacts of climate change on key species, like Ferula assa-foetida 44 45 The Kazakh people of Altay exemplify a deeply rooted model of human-nature coexistence, in which plants function simultaneously as sources of nutrition, medicine, and cultural identity [ 46 Conclusions This ethnobotanical study documents the Kazakh people’s use of 118 MFPs in Altay, Xinjiang, illustrating a deep integration of ecological knowledge and traditional health practices.
