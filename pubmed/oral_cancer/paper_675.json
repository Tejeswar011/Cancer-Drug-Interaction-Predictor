This study evaluates real-world effectiveness in a Danish and United Kingdom (UK) cohort. Patient/material and methods Patients with confirmed rmHNSCC treated with pembrolizumab (2020–2024) as first-line palliative treatment were included consecutively. Data were collected from patient files at four Danish head and neck cancer centres (discovery cohort) and the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (comparison cohort). Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results In the discovery cohort ( n Interpretation In this real-world multi-centre study, pembrolizumab demonstrated efficacy equivalent to the registration studies in two independent cohorts.

As well as an external retrospective comparison cohort with patients treated at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (United Kingdom) between July 2020 and June 2024. Inclusion criteria were histologically and radiologically confirmed rmHNSCC and pembrolizumab administered as first-line monotherapy, to which a prerequisite was a combined positive score (CPS) PD-L1 expression of at least 1. In England, pembrolizumab is approved by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) for first-line treatment of rmHNSCC for patients with CPS ≥1 and a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1. Pembrolizumab is not approved/available to be used in combination with chemotherapy. Initial patient identification was done using appropriate institutional databases (the DAHANCA database for the discovery cohort). This was validated with patients identified by each centre to ensure the most complete inclusion across all centres. Patient identification on site was done through cross-referencing of ICD-10 codes with the national SKS-code system describing diagnosis and treatment respectively. Patient demographics (date of birth, WHO performance status [WHO PS], baseline neutrophil granulocyte count, and concomitant glucocorticoid treatment) and treatment details (dates for start/end of treatment, cycles administered, reason for discontinuation, and prior cancer treatment) were retrieved from medical records, through the DAHANCA database for the discovery cohort, and from an institutional database for the comparison cohort. The effects of patient age on treatment outcomes were analysed both as a continuous and binary variable (≥ 70 vs. < 70 yrs.). Baseline WHO PS was analysed by comparing patients with WHO PS 0–1 to those with WHO PS 2–3. The potential impact of concomitant glucocorticoid treatment was investigated (regardless of dose and indication) using the relative exposure (number of days with systemic glucocorticoids prescribed out of the total duration of pembrolizumab treatment). Patients with baseline neutrophilia were compared with those without, as neutrophilia has previously been associated with an increased risk of progression [ 4 9 Treatment Pembrolizumab was administered as single-agent therapy intravenously, predominantly as 2 mg/kg body weight every 21 days. Danish patients who exhibited a lasting good response to the treatment were transitioned to a double dosage regimen, with treatment administered every 6 weeks after a few months (mo) according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations [ 5 Radiological assessment In Denmark, routine evaluation computed tomography (CT) scans were utilised at each centre to assess treatment response (defined by iRECIST criteria [ 6 Furthermore, patients’ electronic medical records were searched to identify cases of supposed pseudoprogression by searching for keywords related to the phrase ‘ pseudoprogression’. For these identified cases, it was registered whether early radiological progression had occurred as well as whether treatment was continued based on the clinical assessment that the progression was deemed pseudoprogression. PD-L1 In most cases, PD-L1 expression was described using a combined positive score evaluated according to manufacturer instructions (PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx kit from Agilent Technologies, Inc.) defined as the total number of PD-L1 positive cells (tumour cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumour cells times 100. Re-evaluations were completed by an experienced pathologist (TT) if tumour PD-L1 expression was missing or described using tumour proportion score (TPS). However, re-evaluations were not possible for the comparison cohort. The impact of pre-treatment PD-L1 scores was assessed using CPS as both a continuous variable as well as a binary with cut-off 20, as has been done previously by Burtness et al. [ 7 Toxicity Adverse events of any grade documented in medical records as leading to discontinuation of treatment were captured. Less severe adverse events without direct treatment influence were recorded using the patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) implemented as part of patient follow-up (Ambuflex [ 8 Data analysis Descriptive statistics were employed to describe patient population, tumour, and treatment characteristics. The primary endpoint, overall survival (OS), was calculated from the first day of immunotherapeutic treatment to the date of death or study conclusion (January 2024 for the discovery cohort; July 2024 for the comparison cohort). The secondary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), was assessed using the same criteria, as well as time of disease progression, whichever transpired first. The overall response rate (ORR) was calculated as the fraction of patients obtaining either partial response or complete response as defined by the iRECIST criteria. Disease control rate (DCR) was calculated in the same manner as ORR but also included patients with stable disease. Survival curves were derived through the Kaplan-Meier method. The potential impact of prognostic factors on study endpoints was evaluated using the Cox regression model. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the strength and direction of associations. Throughout all analyses, two-sided tests were conducted. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata. Results Patient and treatment characteristics The study included 228 patients in the discovery cohort and 101 in the comparison cohort. The cohorts appeared to differ only concerning baseline WHO PS ( Table 1 Table 1 Patient and treatment characteristics by patient cohort.

Treatment characteristics only differed significantly in terms of best treatment response, where more patients in the Leeds cohort had progressive disease. Data on pseudoprogression were only available for the Danish cohort. Overall efficacy In the Danish discovery cohort, the median OS for pembrolizumab was 10 mo (95% CI: 10–12) ( Figure 1A Figure 1B Figure 1 Overall survival (1A) and progression-free survival (1B) by patient cohort. In the Leeds comparison cohort, a median OS of 10 mo (95% CI: 9–13) was found with a 1 and 2 year survival of 45 and 22%, respectively. In this cohort, the median PFS was 5 mo (95% CI: 4–6) with a 1 and 2 year PFS of 21 and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, we observed an ORR of 16% (95% CI: 9–26) and a DCR of 30% (95% CI: 21–41). Comparing patients based on whether they were treated within the approved head and neck pembrolizumab regimen (larynx, pharynx and oral cavity vs. sino-nasal, salivary gland and unknown primary) showed no significant difference in terms of OS or PFS (HR OS PFS Toxicity Adverse events that led to discontinuation of immunotherapy occurred in 16% of patients in the discovery cohort and 12% in the comparison cohort.

Pseudoprogression In 28 out of 228 Danish patients (12%), early radiological progression was observed, but pembrolizumab treatment was not discontinued due to the clinically assessed possibility of pseudoprogression. Out of these 28 patients, 21 (75%) experienced progression, whereas 7 (25% [95% CI: 12–45]) went on to obtain either stable disease or partial response. Discussion and conclusion In this large multi-centre Danish study, a median OS of 10 mo (95% CI: 10–12), median PFS of 4 mo (95% CI: 4–6), and ORR of 16% (95% CI: 9–26) was observed for pembrolizumab. These results are very similar to what was observed in the phase III studies, and are not significantly different from the estimates obtained by Burtness et al. [ 7 No significant differences were found between the discovery and comparison cohort in terms of OS, PFS, ORR, and the frequency of each grade III–IV adverse events. This supports the hypothesis that the Danish patient cohort is comparable to other, especially Western, cohorts of similar ethnographic composition. Our findings in both the discovery and comparison cohort also align with the findings of Kong et al. [ 3 Pseudoprogression was observed in 25% (95% CI: 12–45%) of patients with early progression and good general condition, similar to rates observed in melanoma patients undergoing PD-1 inhibition therapy (28%) [ 9 As previously shown for nivolumab, WHO PS is hypothesised to play a major role in determining both survival and progression outcomes [ 4 Supplementary material #2C Due to ineligibility of patients with WHO PS > 1 for pembrolizumab in England, this group was not present in the comparison cohort. However, differences in treatment efficacy between the two cohorts remain non-significant while excluding the WHO PS > 1 subgroup from the discovery cohort. Neutrophilia has been associated with an increased rate of disease progression in HNC patients undergoing treatment with nivolumab [ 4 10 11 As other researchers have also demonstrated [ 12 Figure 1B In this national cohort of rmHNSCC patients treated with pembrolizumab as first-line therapy, an efficacy and treatment-limiting toxicity similar to the registration studies were found and further compared to a separate UK cohort. Pembrolizumab monotherapy remains a relevant treatment option for patients with rmHNSCC in good performance, including those in the elderly subpopulation.
