In the United States, approximately one in seven individuals has CKD. Given the kidney's central role in fluid–electrolyte balance, acid–base homeostasis, metabolic regulation, and toxin clearance, progressive loss of kidney function disrupts multiple physiological systems. CKD is strongly associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic, and skeletal complications and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. 1 CKD leads to the systemic accumulation of uremic toxins—endogenously produced metabolites that impair organ function. These toxins vary in size, protein binding, site of origin ( e.g via µ 2 In this issue of Kidney360 et al. 3 Selenium is an essential trace element required for the biosynthesis of selenoproteins, which incorporate the amino acid selenocysteine and function primarily in redox regulation. 4 via Nakano et al. in vitro in vivo Among the 25 identified selenoproteins, GSH peroxidases (GPXs) are central to cellular antioxidant defense. GPX4, in particular, prevents lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic cell death—a regulated, iron-dependent form of necrosis. 5 6 Ferroptosis is also fueled by free iron, which catalyzes lipid oxidation. In corroboration with previous studies, this study affirms the role of AST-120 in improving iron metabolism and partially preventing anemia in adenine-induced CKD mice. 7 8 9 This study delivers several important insights. First, it identifies significant disruptions in trace mineral homeostasis during CKD and demonstrates that gut-adsorbed uremic toxins—especially IS—contribute to selenium deficiency. Second, it links IS to suppression of hepatic SEPP1 and impaired selenium delivery to the kidney. Third, it establishes a mechanistic connection between IS, SEPP1 loss, diminished GPX4, and ferroptotic stress. These findings suggest a deleterious feed-forward loop in which CKD exacerbates itself via Several critical questions remain. First, whether selenium metabolism contributes to sex differences in ferroptosis and CKD progression is unclear. Second, pharmacologic inhibition of IS uptake in hepatocytes blunted SEPP1 suppression in vitro in vivo Although this study provided a beneficial effect of AST-120 in mice with adenine-induced CKD, the clinical utility of AST-120 in humans has been questioned. For instance, AST-120 was approved for human use in Korea, Philippines, and Japan in 1991, and early clinical trials demonstrated that this drug effectively lowered uremic toxins and slowed progression of kidney disease. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial in the United States also recapitulated these findings and showed a dose-dependent effect of AST-120 on uremic toxin accumulation in patients with CKD. However, larger multinational, randomized, double-blind, safety and efficacy trials—Evaluating Prevention of Progression in CKD (EPPIC-1 and EPPIC-2; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00500682 NCT00501046 10 In summary, selenium deficiency in CKD reflects disrupted interorgan communication, particularly along the liver–kidney axis. The kidney's high demand for selenium and dependence on selenoproteins, such as GPX4, make it uniquely vulnerable to IS-mediated redox imbalance. Nakano et al.
