Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 537 million adults aged 20 to 79, which represents about 10% of the world’s population, and this number is projected to rise to 643 million by 2030. Further, 90% of people with DM have type 2 diabetes mellitus, according to data from the International Diabetes Federation [ 1 DM is characterized by hyperglycemia caused by alterations in insulin secretion and function, which is often associated with one or more diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, liver disorder, or kidney malfunction [ 2 Currently, there are different pharmacological treatments for the management of glucose control which act by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, stimulating insulin production, improving insulin sensitivity, inhibiting glucose reabsorption at the renal level, and decreasing glucose absorption by inhibiting α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes [ 3 4 5 6 In this context, the use of medicinal plants as a complement to pharmacological treatment has gained attention in the scientific community, highlighting bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, tannins, phenols and phenolics, among others [ 7 8 Medicinal plants are also helpful in the field of nanotechnology due to their utility in metallic nanoparticle biosynthesis, mainly for silver. Plant chemical components such as flavonoids can act as silver nitrate-reducing agents and form nanoparticles. It has been documented that some plants high in flavonoids form nanoparticles in a more efficient way [ 9 10 11 Research on the use of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles in plants for glucose control has shown promising results in combating DM and controlling its symptoms by regulating insulin levels, glucose absorption, and other histochemistry parameters [ 12 13 One of the main approaches for hyperglycemic therapies is inhibiting the intestinal enzymes responsible for carbohydrate digestion, such as α-amylase and α-glucosidase, which can, in turn, decrease postprandial blood glucose levels; biogenic silver nanoparticles are thought to be a good fit in this regard [ 14 15 16 17 Stenocereus queretaroensis 18 S. queretaroensis 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Phytochemical Screening The phytochemical analysis of the aqueous extract of S. queretaroensis Table 1 Table 2 19 The results of high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS) showed the majority presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids such as sinapic acid, p-coumaroyl tyrosine, procyanidin dimer β1, and dihydroquercetin, Figure 1 p Stenocereus 20 S. queretaroensis 18 S. queretaroensis Some of the compounds present in the extract may serve as reducing and stabilizing agents during nanoparticle synthesis, because they are easily ionized to generate H−ligands and promote the reduction of Ag + 0 21 A recent work showed that flavonoids are superior to polyphenols in their role as reducers and stabilizers in nanoparticle biosynthesis [ 22 2.2. Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles A color change from light brown to dark brown was observed after 30 min of reaction between S. queretaroensis 3 3 23 Silver nanoparticle biosynthesis occurred under aqueous S. queretaroensis 2.3. Ultraviolet−Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy The synthesis of SAgNPs was confirmed via UV–Vis spectroscopy, scanning the reaction product from 300 to 700 nm to observe the plasmon resonance. The UV–Vis absorbance spectrum of SAgNPs revealed a maximum absorbance peak at 420 nm, as previously reported in another study [ 24 25 Figure 2 26 2.4. Particle Size and Zeta Potential The particle size of the biosynthesized SAgNPs was determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The DLS determines the hydrodynamic size of colloids and can be used to estimate the average nanoparticle size [ 27 Figure 3 The zeta potential is related to the charges surrounding the nanoparticle surface and has been employed to evaluate the stability of nanoparticles in a solution. Nanoparticles with zeta potentials larger than +30 mV and less than −30 mV show considerable stability in colloidal dispersions [ 27 Figure 3 2.5. Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis The morphology and elemental configuration of the SAgNPs were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Based on the SEM images, shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 28 29 2.6. X-Ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD) XRD was used to determine the synthesized SAgNPs’ crystalline phase. The XRD spectra of the SAgNPs obtained ranged from 20° to 70°. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample exhibits diffraction peaks located at ~38.1°, 44.3°, and 64.5° 2θ, which are indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) crystallographic planes of silver (ICDD: 01-087-0597) (Cifuentes-Jiménez et al., 2024) [ 30 31 32 33 Figure 5 S. queretaroensis 34 35 36 2.7. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer Spectroscopy Analysis (FTIR) FTIR was conducted to determine the possible functional groups responsible for the reduction of Ag + S. queretaroensis −1 Figure 6 Table 3 −1 37 −1 38 The SAgNPs’ spectral features are slightly shifted compared to those of the S. queretaroensis 39 2.8. Antidiabetic Activity In Vitro Starch digestion in mammals requires multiple enzymes, the most significant of which are α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Together, they rapidly convert digestible starch into glucose. Starch is initially hydrolyzed by human salivary α-amylase in the mouth, followed by human pancreatic α-amylase in the intestine, to produce oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides are eventually hydrolyzed to absorbable monosaccharides by α-glucosidase. Inhibiting carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes is one of the best approaches for slowing glucose absorption and works by reducing postprandial glucose blood concentration; thus, it represents an important drug target in diabetes prevention and treatment [ 40 41 The SAgNPs inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in Figure 7 The SAgNPs showed a slightly higher IC 50 Table 4 50 50 41 Enicostema axillare 42 Several biosynthesized silver nanoparticles have shown inhibitory activity against α-amylase and α-glucosidase at different concentrations. Therefore, it is necessary to consider IC 50 50 43 50 Barringtonia racemosa 44 50 Annona muricata 45 50 Ageratum conyzoides 46 Some authors have proposed that, as a mechanism of action, the chemical constituents of plant extracts attached to silver nanoparticles might attach to the enzyme system and, hence, disrupt enzymatic activity [ 47 48 Regarding glucosidase inhibition by silver nanoparticles, one study reported two types of nanoparticles synthesized from two different kinds of sweet potato, with IC 50 49 50 50 2.9. Postprandial Hypoglycemic Activity In Vivo The inhibitory effect of SAgNPs on blood sugar levels in vivo was verified by feeding maltose to Balb-c healthy mice. Figure 8 Fagonica cretica 16 The antidiabetic activity of biogenic nanoparticles in animal models has been reported by several authors. For example, one study showed that nanoparticles obtained using a Thymus serpyllum 13 Fagonia cretica 16 A previous review has proposed that many characteristics of biogenic silver nanoparticles potentially influence their antidiabetic activity. They can regulate specific gene expressions, inhibit enzymatic activity, and modulate diabetic conditions by radical scavenging. Additionally, they can alleviate diabetes-based conditions by reducing proinflammatory molecules, enhancing wound healing, and influencing additional enzymes to induce antioxidant mechanisms [ 51 52 A limitation of this study is the absence of an experimental group treated with S. queretaroensis 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Chemical Reagents All the chemicals used in this study were of analytic grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany), and distilled water was used for the experiments. 3.2. Plant Material The partially dried S. queretaroensis I42300 3.2.1. Preparation of Aqueous Extract The dried S. queretaroensis 53 3.2.2. Phytochemical Characterization Qualitative phytochemical analysis was carried out according to the known following standard protocols, and the glycoside content was determined by Fehling’s method [ 54 4 The Dragendorff method was used to detect the presence of alkaloids [ 55 3 4 6 6 The Liebermann–Burchard test was used for steroid and triterpenoid determination by dissolving the flower extract in chloroform and acetic anhydride. Two or three drops of sulfuric acid were added to the mixture. During the reaction, the color changed from red at the top of the tube to green, which indicated the presence of sterols, respectively [ 56 For the determination of tannins, 1 mL of the flower extract was mixed with 1 mL of 1% ferric chloride. The development of a green or blue color indicated the presence of tannins [ 57 Saponins were detected via a foam test by adding 1 mL of the flower extract to 5 mL of distilled water in a test tube. The mixture was vigorously agitated using a vortex for several minutes, with the formation of a persistent foam indicating the presence of saponins [ 58 A qualitative phytochemical analysis of flavonoid content was conducted using the aluminum chloride method [ 59 2 2 3 2 The quantitative phenolic compound content was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu method [ 59 3 12 40 3 12 40 2 3 Absorbance was measured at 750 nm, and the phenolic content was expressed as micrograms of gallic acid equivalents per milliliter (μg GAE/mL). 3.2.3. Identification of Phenolic Compounds by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography We performed HPLC-QToF-MS determination using an Agilent 1260-Infinity II liquid chromatograph with a QToF-MS mass detector by Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a Phenomenex C 18 S. queretaroensis The extracted ion chromatogram was obtained for each identified compound and searched in the PhytoHub database, version 1.4 [ 60 61 3.3. Biosynthesis of Nanoparticles Nanoparticle synthesis was carried out using a method previously reported by our team [ 62 S. queretaroensis 3.4. Characterization of SAgNPs 3.4.1. Ultraviolet–Visible Spectroscopy Analysis The flower extract-mediated reduction of AgNO 3 63 3.4.2. Particle Size and Zeta Potential Measurement The SAgNPs’ zeta potential and size were determined through DLS with a Zetasizer Nanoseries instrument by Malvern-Panalytical (Malvern, Worcs, UK) to measure the light scattered by particles in the solution. Fluctuations in intensity over time are indicative of the particle size and can be derived using the Stokes–Einstein relation. Zeta potential is the potential at the slipping/shear plane of a colloid particle moving under an electric field. To determine the zeta potential, an electric field is applied, and the electrophoretic mobility of the particles is measured [ 64 3.4.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy–Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis The surface morphology and elemental compositions of the synthesized SAgNPs were determined by SEM-EDX, a powerful analytical method widely utilized for surface imaging and elemental analysis at the microscopic scale across diverse scientific disciplines [ 64 3.4.4. X-Ray Diffraction Analysis An X-ray diffractogram was obtained in the range of 20–70°2θ with an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer instrument Malvern-Panalytical (Malvern, Worcs, UK) using Bragg–Brentano geometry, a PIXcel1D-Medipix3 detector, and CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 45 kV and 40 mA. The sample was analyzed with a transmission–reflection spinning station with a size and passage time of 0.0263°2θ and 246.84 s, respectively. The incident beam optics included a 0.04 rad Soller grating, a 10 mm fixed mask, a 1/2° fixed divergence grating, and 2° fixed anti-scatter gratings. On the other hand, a 0.04 rad Soller grating and a 7.5 mm anti-scatter grating were used in the diffracted beam optics, and phases were identified using HighScore Plus software (version 3.0) [ 65 3.4.5. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer Spectroscopy (FTIR) Analysis For FTIR analysis, the samples were deposited on KTIR-grade KBr tablets and measured at room temperature using a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer by Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) in the range of 4000–400 cm −1 −1 66 3.5. Evaluation of Antidiabetic Activity In Vitro The α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition test for the SAgNPs was performed according to widely reported methods, with modifications. For the α-amylase inhibition test, 250 µL of SAgNPs (0.63 to 10 µg/mL) or acarbose (0.25 to 4 µg/mL) and 25 µL of a solution of pancreatic α-amylase (0.5 mg/mL) in phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) (0.01 M of phosphate buffer, 0.0027 M of potassium chloride, and 0.137 M of sodium chloride) were added to a 96-well microplate and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in a shaker. Subsequently, 25 µL of 1% of starch solution in PBS was added and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, and, finally, 50 µL of dinitro salicylic acid reagent was added and incubated for 5 min at 95–100 °C. After cooling, the absorbance was read at 540 nm on a microplate reader UV-Vis xMark, Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA). Acarbose was used as a control [ 67 The α-amylase inhibitory activity is expressed as the percentage inhibition, and it was calculated according to the equation below: %  I n h i b i t i o n = ( 1 − S a m p l e  A b s o r b a n c e N e g a t i v e  c o n t r o l  A b s o r b a n c e ) × 100 To determine the enzymatic inhibition of α-glucosidase in a 96-well microplate, 50 µL of SAgNPs (0.63 to 10 µg/mL) or acarbose (0.5 to 4 µg/mL) and 100 µL of α-glucosidase solution (1.0 mg/mL) prepared in PBS were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 100 µL of a 0.1 M solution of 4-Nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside diluted in PBS was added and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The absorbance was read at 405 nm at the beginning and at the end of the 5 min incubation period on a microplate reader UV–Vis xMark, Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) to obtain the absorbance change value. Acarbose was used as the control [ 68 The α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was expressed as the percentage inhibition and was calculated according to the following equation: %  I n h i b i t i o n = A b s o r b a n c e  c h a n g e  i n  c o n t r o l − A b s o r b a n c e  c h a n g e  i n  s a m p l e A b s o r b a n c e  c h a n g e  i n  c o n t r o l × 100 3.6. Evaluation of Postprandial Hypoglycemic Activity In Vivo Ethical clearance for the protocol was obtained in strict accordance with the national Mexican Official Norm for Animal Care and Handling (NOM-062-ZOO-1999) [ 69 Regarding toxicological evaluation, our previous studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles biosynthesized using S. queretaroensis 70 S. queretaroensis Healthy mice (15 animals, Balb-c strain, 8 weeks old), acquired by Bioterio Morelos, were housed in an animal room at 20−22 °C with a 12 h light/dark cycle. According to the health certificate from the supplier, the animals were healthy, and there were no exclusions. After 5 days of acclimation-free access to water and food, they were randomly divided into three groups ( n 71 72 73 After fasting for 12 h, all animal groups were gavaged with maltose solution (3000 mg/kg), with each treated animal being identified by a mark. At the same time, samples were administered intragastrically, and the initial glucose level was measured in the tail vein using a One Touch, Lifescan (Paterson, NJ, USA) portable glucometer. After 20 min of gavage, the glucose level was measured again [ 74 3.7. Statistical Analysis The data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p 4. Conclusions In conclusion, the current study revealed that silver nanoparticles can be synthesized using a biological method employing S. queretaroensis S. queretaroensis In the present study, we established that SAgNPs display α-amylase- and α-glucosidase-inhibiting activity in vitro. SAgNPS reduced postprandial glucose level in healthy animals, an effect likely attributable to delayed carbohydrate digestion, as supported by the in vitro findings. It is further recommended that the mode of action of these nanoparticles should be studied in preclinical studies with diabetic animals. Further research into the pharmacokinetics and safety of SAgNPs is necessary to develop nanodrugs for glycemic management in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is most prevalent in the population.
