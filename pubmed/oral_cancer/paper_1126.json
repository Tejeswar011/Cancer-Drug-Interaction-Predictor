Recent studies showed that lipid metabolism in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can have critical impact on cancer cell growth. Our findings demonstrated that the presence of lipid-laden CAFs was an independent indicator of poor prognosis and was significantly correlated with presence of IM-type DR in CRC. Additionally, adipophilin expression in carcinoma cells at the invasive front was significantly correlated with both IM-type DR and the presence of lipid-laden CAFs. The presence of lipid-laden CAFs in CRC may enhance cancer progression and metastasis, and may link a lipid-rich tumor microenvironment. Abstract Background/Objectives: Immature-type (IM type) desmoplastic reaction (DR) is a poor prognostic indicator of CRC; however, the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Recent studies have demonstrated that energy metabolism, including lipid metabolism, in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can critically impact cancer cell growth. The prognostic significance of lipid-laden CAFs in CRC has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to clarify whether the presence of lipid-laden CAFs correlates with the DR type and prognosis in CRC. Methods: We enrolled patients with pT3 or pT4 CRC who underwent surgical resection without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Immunohistochemical staining for adipophilin (ADP) was performed to determine the presence of lipid-laden CAFs. Results: The cohort included 70 patients (49 men and 21 women) with a median age of 74 years. ADP-positive lipid-laden CAFs were observed in 37 patients (53%). The presence of lipid-laden CAFs and ADP expression in carcinoma cells at the invasive front was significantly correlated with IM-type DR ( p p p colorectal cancer cancer-associated fibroblasts desmoplastic reaction lipid metabolism lipid-laden cancer-associated fibroblasts JSPS KAKENHI JP23K15509 JP22K06948 JP25K10291 Osaka Community Foundation 2023 This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI, grant number JP23K15509 (to T.K.) and JP22K06948, JP25K10291 (to M.I.) and the Osaka Community Foundation 2023 (to T.K.). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and its incidence is steadily increasing [ 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 7 8 9 10 11 7 8 12 13 14 15 7 8 12 13 14 15 7 12 It has been demonstrated that energy metabolism markedly changes in carcinoma cells, and metabolic reprogramming is considered a hallmark of cancer [ 16 16 17 18 19 20 17 20 16 17 18 19 20 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 23 24 24 27 25 26 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patient Selection We enrolled consecutive patients with CRC who underwent surgical resection at the Department of Surgery of Kansai Medical University Hospital between January and December 2016. Patients with pT1 or pT2 disease were excluded since DR is defined as pT3 or pT4 [ 7 8 12 13 14 15 28 KRAS BRAF The study cohort partially overlapped with that of our previous studies [ 2 29 29 2 2 29 This retrospective study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2021-197). All data were anonymized. The Institutional Review Board waived the requirement for informed consent, because this was the retrospective study, and medical records and archived samples were used, and there was no risk to the participants. Additionally, this study did not include children. Information regarding this study was provided through the institutional website ( https://www.kmu.ac.jp/hirakata/hospital/2671t800001356c-att/a1642567101597.pdf 2.2. Histopathological Analysis Surgically resected specimens were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Two researchers (T.K. and M.I.) blinded to the clinical features independently evaluated the histopathological features of all tumor slides. The staging of patients with CRC is currently described in the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, Eighth edition [ 30 DR was classified into the IM, intermediate, and mature types according to the definition by Ueno et al. in patients with pT3 or 4 CRC [ 7 8 12 13 14 15 TB was evaluated using the same method as previously reported [ 31 2.3. Immunohistochemical Analysis A whole section of the most morphologically representative carcinoma regions with DR, identified by hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, was used for immunohistochemical staining of each tumor. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an autostainer (Discovery ULTRA system; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An OptiView DAB Universal Kit (760-700) was used for immunostaining. Dual immunohistochemical staining was performed using an autostainer (Leica BOND-MAX; Leica Biosystems GmbH, Nußloch, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. BOND Polymer Refine Detection Kit (DS9800; Leica) and BOND Polymer Refine Red Detection Kit (DS9390; Leica) were used. A primary mouse monoclonal antibody against ADP (AP125, ×100 dilution, Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) and a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) (1A4, ×800 dilution, DAKO, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used. Human sebaceous glands and the muscularis propria of the colon were used as positive controls for ADP and alpha-SMA staining, respectively. Two researchers (T.K. and M.I.) blinded to the clinical or histopathological features independently evaluated the immunostaining results. When there were discrepancies of the results of the evaluation, a final decision was made by reassessment and agreement by two researchers. First, we performed a single immunohistochemical staining for ADP in all CRC samples. ADP expression was evaluated in both the carcinoma cells and CAFs. If the tumors contained ADP-positive spindle cells around the carcinoma cell nests by single immunohistochemical staining for ADP, then dual immunohistochemical staining for ADP and alpha-SMA were performed to clarify whether these ADP-expressing spindle cells were CAFs or not. Both ADP and alpha-SMA were expressed in spindle cells, and these cells were recognized as lipid-laden CAFs. ADP-positivity in the carcinoma cells were evaluated by the morphological features as well as alpha-SMA negativity. ADP expression in both carcinoma cells and CAFs was identified as positive when carcinoma cells or CAFs exhibited granular and/or globular cytoplasmic expression, as previously reported [ 32 33 34 35 36 2.4. Statistical Analyses JMP ® p p 3. Results 3.1. Clinicopathological Characteristics of the Study Cohort Table 1 Figure 1 3.2. Histopathological Characteristics Thirty-five (50%) patients each were classified into IM and non-IM type DR, respectively. The typical histopathological features of IM-type DR and non-IM type DR (intermediate type) are shown in Figure 2 p Table 1 3.3. Immunohistochemical Characteristics The typical features of ADP-positive lipid-laden CAFs at the invasive front are shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 ADP expression was also observed in carcinoma cells. The median ratio of ADP-expressing carcinoma cells to total carcinoma cells was 10%; thus, we considered an ADP-high carcinoma if >10% of carcinoma cells showed positive immunoreactivity for ADP. Twenty-nine patients (41%) had ADP-high carcinomas ( Table 1 p Additionally, ADP expression in carcinoma cells at the invasive front was observed in 51 patients (73%) ( Figure 3 p 3.4.

Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Analysis for OS Table 3 p To avoid model overfitting due to the limited number of events, only three variables were selected for the multivariate Cox regression model, based on clinical relevance and statistical significance in the univariate analysis.

Discussion This study clearly demonstrated that the presence of lipid-laden CAFs was an independent indicator of poor prognosis and was correlated with IM-type DR in CRC. Additionally, ADP expression in carcinoma cells at the invasive front was significantly correlated with both IM-type DR and the presence of lipid-laden CAFs. These results indicate that IM-type DR might be linked to a lipid-rich TME, and this environment might lead to a poor prognosis in patients with CRC. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the prognostic significance of lipid-laden CAFs and their correlation with IM-type DR in CRC. It is well recognized that reprogramming lipid metabolism is crucial for cancer cell growth and proliferation because lipids are essential sources of cell membranes and energy [ 17 20 de novo 17 20 19 21 22 37 38 39 37 38 39 23 24 25 26 23 24 25 22 23 24 25 26 KRAS 40 KRAS Previous studies have shown that ADP expression in carcinoma cells is a significantly poor prognostic indicator in some types of carcinomas, such as lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, salivary duct carcinoma, and metastatic CRC in the liver [ 32 33 34 35 36 35 41 24 It is well established that IM-type DR is significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients with CRC, which corresponds with our findings in this study. The DR types may represent the TME, including CAFs [ 7 8 12 8 12 12 7 This study had some limitations. First, it was conducted at a single institute with a relatively small sample size. Although this study included 70 patients with pT3 or pT4 CRC, a selection bias cannot be ruled out. Patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy were excluded because DR and the tumor microenvironment could be affected by neoadjuvant therapy. This may have limited the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, external validation using an independent cohort was not performed. Therefore, our findings should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating and require further validation in larger, multicenter cohorts. Second, this study clearly showed that both the presence of lipid-laden CAFs and ADP expression in carcinoma cells at the invasive front were significantly correlated with IM-type DR. Therefore, IM-type DR may be linked to the lipid-rich TME. However, our findings did not reveal the main player involved in lipid synthesis, carcinoma cells, or CAFs. Therefore, further studies are required to clarify the metabolic changes in both carcinoma cells and CAFs, as well as the molecular alterations in carcinoma cells. Third, a direct demonstration of the presence of lipids in the TME of IM-type DR was not performed because lipids are dissolved during the preparation of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens. Fourth, the present cohort showed relatively high frequency of venous invasion. This might be related to the inclusion criteria of the present study. Specifically, all patients had pT3 or pT4 CRC, and 13 patients (19%) had stage IV disease. Therefore, the present cohort represented a relatively advanced population of CRC patients, which likely contributed to the high incidence of venous invasion. Moreover, no genetic data of carcinoma cells, as well as immunological markers, were available in the present cohort. Presence of lipid-laden CAFs might be related to genetic changes because KRAS mutation status can transform CAFs into lipid-laden CAFs in mouse models [ 40 5. Conclusions This study clearly demonstrated that the presence of lipid-laden CAFs and ADP expression in carcinoma cells at the invasive front were significantly correlated with IM-type DR. The presence of lipid-laden CAFs may be linked to a lipid-rich TME, which might enhance cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism underlying IM-type DR with respect to metabolic changes in both lipid-laden CAFs and carcinoma cells.
