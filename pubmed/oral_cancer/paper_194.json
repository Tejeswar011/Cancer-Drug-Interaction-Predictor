Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) derived exosomes are a promising regenerative therapy. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potentiality of BM-MSCs derived exosomes against the neurotoxicity induced by DOX. Methods Twenty-four male albino rats were divided equally in to three groups as follow: group 1 (control), group 2 (rats injected intraperitoneally (i.p|) with DOX at a dose 2.5mg/Kg), and group 3 (rats injected with DOX and BM-MSCs derived exosomes i.p at a dose 1.5ml/Kg). During the experiment the behavior tests were noted, after three weeks rats were sacrificed, serum and brain samples were collected for biochemical, molecular and histopathological examinations. Results The results revealed that DOX causing impairment of the locomotor and increasing the anxiety like behavior of rats, marked neuropathological changes, significant elevation of MDA content and TNF-α concentration, reduction of phospholipase (PLD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) protein concentration in addition, there were up regulation of JNK, NF-κB and p38 genes and down regulation of Erk1. Conclusion Exosomal therapy improved the substantial neurotoxicity of DOX through modulating the markers involved in the neurotoxic signalling pathway of DOX that resulting in improving the pathological lesions and the animal behaviours.
