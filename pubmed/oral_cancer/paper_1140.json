Non-anemic iron deficiency (ID) is highly prevalent among HF patients, and it has been related to worse outcomes. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) has been related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease, HF and iron pathophysiology. Nevertheless, the specific potential role of GDF15 in HF patients with ID has not been fully explored. In this cross-sectional study we determined serum GDF15 levels in 60 HF patients with ID from the IRON-PATH II study. The discriminative capacity of GDF15 in logistic regression models for classifying these patients according to ischemic etiology was defined as the primary endpoint. Additionally, relationships between GDF15 levels and impaired right ventricle function, impaired functional capacity and HF were included as secondary endpoints. GDF15 was inversely related to tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and the six-minute walking test (6MWT), and positively related to hallmarks of HF [i.e., N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)] and other molecules influenced by HF progression [i.e., creatinine and ferritin]. Moreover, GDF15 was inversely related to hemoglobin, suggesting a potential link to iron homeostasis. Furthermore, GDF15 showed good classification capacity and improved the accuracy of a logistic regression model for ischemic HF classification in patients with ID. Overall, the findings of this study propose serum GDF15 levels as a potential tool for the classification of HF patients with ID according to the ischemic etiology.

Introduction The global prevalence of heart failure (HF), particularly of ischemic etiology, continues to increase worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 4 7 8 9 10 11 12 11 13 11 14 15 Despite improvements in the therapies to minimize myocardial damage due to ischemic injuries, a substantial proportion of patients develop HF after myocardial infarction [ 16 17 18 Among the serum circulating molecules that may behave as sensors for several CV events triggering HF, increasing evidence highlights the role of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 20 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 33 34 35 36 In this study, we hypothesized that, given the role of GDF15 in both atherosclerotic CV disease and iron pathophysiology, serum GDF15 levels may contribute to the classification of HF of ischemic etiology in patients with non-anemic ID. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patients and Study Design A cross-sectional study was performed in a subset of baseline samples from 60 HF patients with ID from the IRON-PATH II study (New pathophysiological pathways involved in iron metabolism disorder in HF: The IRON PATH II investigator-initiated Study, NCT05000853 37 38 Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the reference Ethic Committees and performed in compliance with the ethical standards outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki [ 39 2.2. Clinical Data and Standard Biochemical Determinations Demographic, anthropometric and clinical data were recorded from all participants at the point of study inclusion following standardized procedures. The available data includes age, gender, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, weight and height, disease status and medication, among other parameters. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the weight and height measurements (Kg/m 2 Ischemic etiology was defined according to the clinical judgment of the treating physician in patients with a history of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and ventricular dysfunction, or HF with LVEF <50% in whom coronary imaging (coronary angiography or coronary computed tomography) showed lesions >50% in the main epicardial coronary vessels. Serum samples were obtained from venous blood sample of each patient after overnight fasting and stored at −80 °C for future analysis. Hemoglobin was measured by impedance laser colorimetry (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The serum N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was determined by using a commercial immunochemiluminescence kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Serum creatinine (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was determined by molecular absorption spectrometry by using an isotopic dilution-mass spectrometry (ID-MS) standardized method and was used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate as previously described [ 39 2.3. Serum GDF15 Determination The serum GDF15 levels were determined using a commercial sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc., Rochester Hills, MI, USA), with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation estimated at 5%. Briefly, serum samples were diluted 2-fold and incubated in duplicate in microplate wells pre-coated with a capture polyclonal antibody specific for native human GDF15 for 60 min on an orbital shaker. After washing with the wash buffer solution, wells were incubated with a polyclonal detection antibody for 60 min, washed and incubated with streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate for 60 min. After a last washing, a tetra-methylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution was added and the plate was incubated for 30 min. Then, reaction was stopped by addition of 3M H 2 4 2.4. Statistical Analysis The normal distribution of continuous variables was determined by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and variables not showing Gaussian distributions were log-transformed to reduce skewness. Data are shown as frequencies for categorical variables. Continuous variables are shown as median and interquartile range, or mean ± SEM. Both bivariate and partial correlations adjusted for confounding factors were carried out to assess the associations between GDF15 and anthropometric and analytical data. Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were constructed to search for independent relationships between GDF15 (dependent variable) and anthropometric and analytical variables. Data are expressed as standardized beta (β). Differences between groups were adjusted for confounding factors through the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Multivariate logistic binary regression models were built to assess the ability of GDF15 to classify the HF ischemic etiology by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) was analyzed to explore the accuracy of the logistic regression models. The analyses were performed with the SPSS software (version 22.0, IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA). Differences were considered statistically significant at p 3. Results 3.1. Characteristics of Study Population Information related to demographic, clinical, cardiac function and analytical data is shown in Table 1 Table S1 3.2. Relationship Between Serum GDF15, Cardiac Function and Iron-Related Hallmarks The associations between serum GDF15 and anthropometric and analytical data were analyzed ( Table 2 ρ p ρ p ρ p ρ p ρ p ρ p ρ p ρ p ρ p ρ p Furthermore, by using multivariate linear regression models including GDF15 as the dependent variable, the independent relationships between GDF15 and systolic blood pressure (R 2 p 2 p 2 p 2 p 2 p 2 p 2 p 2 p Table 3 3.3. Serum GDF15 Levels Classify Patients with HF of Ischemic Etiology No statistically significant differences were found in the GDF15 levels related to the sex of patients with HF and ID ( Figure S1A Figure S1B Figure S1C Figure 1 Figure 1 p Figure 1 Because serum GDF15 levels were higher in patients with HF of an ischemic etiology, we explored whether its circulating levels improve discrimination in a model of this etiology. First, by using a conditional stepwise forward method, we established a logistic regression model including gender, iron and ferritin (Model 1). GDF15 showed a higher AUC than this model [GDF15: AUC (95% CI) = 0.749 (0.624–0.874); Model 1: AUC (95% CI) = 0.718 (0.583–0.854)], and increased its discriminatory value once added to the model [Model 2: AUC (95% CI) = 0.878 (0.790–0.965)] in the ROC analysis ( Figure 2 4. Discussion Despite significant progress in therapeutic approaches aimed at attenuating myocardial injury secondary to ischemic insults, a significant number of patients continue to develop HF following a myocardial infarction [ 16 3 4 5 6 7 27 28 29 30 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 33 34 GDF15 is a stress-response cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily [ 40 41 42 43 19 20 21 44 45 19 46 47 33 36 48 49 50 Given the close relationship between GDF15 and HF, we next analyzed its levels according to the NYHA classification. It has been previously described that GDF15 levels increased with HF severity [ 51 52 53 54 17 18 Our study has some limitations that should be accounted for. First, it was performed in a subset of HF patients with ID from a larger cohort. Nevertheless, the multicentric design of the study strengthens our findings. The relatively small sample size of our cohort may attenuate the impact of the results, and further studies in larger populations are warranted to validate our findings. Additionally, its cross-sectional nature precludes establishing cause–effect relationships and evaluating the potential role of GDF15 in predicting the disease evolution. However, our findings are in line with a large number of studies exploring the role of GDF15 in atherosclerotic CV disease [ 27 28 29 30 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 5. Conclusions Overall, our findings provide evidence about the relationship between serum GDF15 levels and impaired right ventricle function, impaired functional capacity and HF, specifically in a set of patients with HF and ID. Furthermore, we demonstrate that serum GDF15 levels provide robust discriminative capacity and enhance the performance of a logistic regression model for ischemic HF, supporting its potential as a valuable tool for classifying the ischemic etiology in HF patients with ID.
