Objective This study aimed to develop an individualized dosing strategy for voriconazole (VRZ) in children under 2 years of age by integrating machine learning (ML) and population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling. Methods This retrospective observational study included 76 eligible pediatric patients for model development, analyzing their baseline characteristics and laboratory parameters. A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model using NONMEM ® 2 Results A total of 76 pediatric patients were enrolled for model development, consisting of 58 males (76.3%) and 18 females (23.7%), with a median age of 11 months and a median weight of 8.05 kg. We analyzed 110 therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) samples of VRZ from these participants. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination described the population pharmacokinetics of VRZ. Population estimates for apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) were 17.9 L/h/70kg (RSE, 10.8%) and 788 L/70kg (RSE, 15.4%), respectively.

We developed a model that integrate PopPK with ML approaches to predict the steady-state plasma concentration of oral VRZ in this age group. The study workflow was presented in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Study process workflow. Flowchart outlining the process of analyzing pediatric patients treated with Voriconazole from January 2020 to June 2025, involving three steps: data collection, PopPK model development, and machine learning. Data collection includes criteria for inclusion and exclusion, resulting in 76 patients. The PopPK model develops through base model creation, covariate analysis, and evaluation. The machine learning step employs dataset splitting, feature selection via Boruta, and various algorithms, identifying XGBoost as the final model, with validation and interpretation steps. Metrics like R-squared, RMSE, MSE, and MAE are considered. 2 Methods 2.1 Study design We conducted a retrospective observational study analyzing data from pediatric patients aged under 24 months who had been hospitalized at the Children’s Hospital of Fudan University from January 2020 to June 2025. Inclusion criteria included patients aged below 2 years who received oral VRZ for a minimum of 3 days during their hospitalization and underwent therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) ( Chen et al., 2018 Resztak et al., 2021 Filion et al., 2016 Strutz et al., 2025 For patients who satisfied the enrollment criteria, a comprehensive set of data was collected from their electronic medical records. Clinical characteristics included age, sex, height (HT), and weight (WT), from which the body surface area (BSA) was calculated using the formula: BSA (m 2  HT cm × WT kg 3600 Schwartz et al., 1984 Schwartz et al., 2009 Treating physicians determined VRZ doses individually for each patient, considering clinical status and therapeutic drug monitoring. While referencing the standard 9 mg/kg q12h regimen for older children (2 to <12 years), oral doses for children under 2 years ranged from 4 to 10 mg/kg every 12 h. This dosing strategy is consistent with recommendations from UpToDate, a clinical decision support system ( Isaac et al., 2012 Shen et al., 2024 2.2 VRZ therapeutic drug monitoring The plasma concentration of VRZ was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Shimadzu LC-20 series HPLC system (Shimadzu, Japan). A Waters XBridge C18 chromatographic column (4.6 × 150mm, 5 μm) was used. The mobile phase A consisted of water, while mobile phase B was acetonitrile. The injection volume was 20 μL, with the detection wavelength fixed at 256 nm. The standard curve for VRZ covered a linear range of 0.25–10 mg/L. The target concentration for VRZ was set between one and 5.5 mg/L in plasma trough ( Pappas et al., 2016 2.3 Population pharmacokinetic modeling The PopPK analysis of VRZ was carried out in NONMEM ® -1 Gastine et al., 2018 Covariates were evaluated utilizing a stepwise forward-addition/backward-elimination approach based on objective function value (OFV) changes. During forward selection, covariates were included if they reduced the OFV by > 3.84 (p < 0.05). In the backward elimination phase, covariates were retained in the final model only if their removal increased the OFV by > 6.63 (p < 0.01). Final model evaluation was conducted through diagnostic goodness-of-fit (GOF) plots, bootstrap analysis, and visual predictive check (VPC). Parameter precision was evaluated, and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were generated using bootstrap resampling (n = 1000). VPC analysis was performed using 1000 simulated datasets to characterize the distribution characteristics of observed versus simulated data. The final PopPK model enabled the calculation of pediatric individual PK parameters CL and V via the empirical Bayesian estimates method. These PK parameters were subsequently introduced as features in the ML model. 2.4 Machine learning modeling For model development and validation, the dataset was randomly partitioned into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). The Boruta algorithm was employed for feature selection to identify all relevant features ( Shen et al., 2024 Li et al., 2025 Model performance was assessed using four standard regression metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R 2 2 Huang et al., 2020 Qi et al., 2025 2.5 Statistical analysis Categorical variables were presented using frequencies and percentages [N (%)]. Continuous variables were described using both medians with interquartile ranges [Median (IQR)] and means with standard deviations [Mean ± SD]. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to analyze continuous variables, while Fisher’s exact test was employed for categorical variables. A p-value of below 0.05 was established as the threshold for statistical significance. VRZ plasma concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.25 mg/L were labeled as below quantitation limit (BQL). These BQL values were substituted with half the LLOQ value (0.125 mg/L) ( Chabala et al., 2022 3 Results 3.1 Clinical characteristics of pediatric patients The clinical and demographic characteristics of the 76 pediatric patients, from whom 110 samples were collected, were summarized in Table 1 9 Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Figure S1 TABLE 1 Clinical characteristics of the study population.

Inputs include age, weight, BSA, WBC, RBC, HGB, INR, CL/F, V/F, and total daily dose. Upon execution, the system calculates the VRZ predicted concentration as 1.06 mg/L. TDM results show a VRZ plasma concentration of 1.21 mg/L. The process involves NONMEM for parameter estimation and TDM for results verification. 4 Discussion VRZ is a critical therapeutic agent for invasive fungal infections; however, evidence-based dosing guidelines and drug exposure data in children younger than 24 months are scarce. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a model integrating PopPK with ML to estimate steady-state plasma concentrations of oral VRZ in this vulnerable pediatric population. This study enrolled 76 pediatric patients, including 58 males (76.32%) and 18 females (23.68%), with a median age of 11 months and a weight of 8.1 kg. Using a Bayesian PopPK approach, we estimated individual clearance and volume of distribution, incorporating these PK parameters as features in our ML model. Prior to model development, the Boruta algorithm was used for feature selection, resulting in 10 variables being included in the final ML model. The XGBoost algorithm demonstrated optimal predictive ability for VRZ plasma concentrations in children under 2 years, with an R 2 Previous studies have investigated VRZ dosing and plasma concentrations in diverse patient populations. For instance, Gastine et al. Gastine et al., 2023 et al. Huang et al., 2025 2 et al. 2 Liu et al., 2025 2 In our PopPK model, body weight was incorporated as a covariate influencing VRZ clearance. Numerous factors have been reported to affect VRZ metabolism, contributing to variability in blood concentrations. Patient demographics significantly influence voriconazole pharmacokinetics. Age-related differences are notable, with pediatric patients requiring higher weight-based dosing due to faster clearance compared to adults ( Tilen et al., 2022 et al. Wang et al., 2014 et al. Johnson et al., 2010 SHAP analysis identified CL as the most significant factor influencing VRZ concentration, consistent with the substantial interindividual variability observed in clearance among individuals. This variability likely reflects underlying physiological differences such as liver function, which is primarily responsible for metabolizing voriconazole ( Hashemiza et al., 2017 Gorski et al., 2011 Wang et al., 2018 Takahashi et al., 2020 Tilen et al., 2022 2 Neely et al., 2010 Shima et al., 2010 Hsu et al., 2015 Neely et al., 2010 Chen et al., 2022 Bartelink et al., 2013 The study had several limitations. First, as a single-center, retrospective analysis, the findings may have limited generalizability. Furthermore, the study population comprised exclusively of Asian children; PK differences across ethnic groups suggest that the model’s applicability to non-Asian pediatric populations requires further investigation ( Chen et al., 2018 Weiss et al., 2009 The trough-only sampling design resulted in a wide 95% confidence interval for the apparent volume of distribution (V/F 94.82–1050.85L/70kg). While this approach optimized the estimation of voriconazole clearance (CL/F), it provided limited information regarding drug distribution. Nevertheless, the stability of the overall model structure and the reliability of key parameter estimates were supported by a 100% success rate in bootstrap validation. Moreover, our findings were consistent with previously reported high inter-individual variability and allometric scaling in pediatric populations ( Friberg et al., 2012 Additionally, the model did not include genotype features related to VRZ metabolism, such as CYP2C19, which may limit a comprehensive understanding of drug metabolism ( Moriyama et al., 2017 Caudle et al., 2025 5 Conclusion This study represented the first effort to merge classic PopPK with ML to develop a predictive model for oral VRZ plasma concentrations in children under 24 months. A one-compartment model of voriconazole was established for this age group, revealing that weight significantly impacts CL/F and V/F. Individual CL and V were estimated using the empirical Bayesian method, which were then incorporated into the ML modeling process. We used the Boruta algorithm for feature selection and constructed prediction models for VRZ plasma concentrations employing various ML algorithms. Among these, XGBoost demonstrated the best performance, achieving an R 2 Our findings provide a significant reference for individualized voriconazole dosing in clinical practice for children under 2 years old. A potential benefit of the model lies in its capacity to suggest an initial dose before TDM results are available, which may contribute to a more timely achievement of effective therapeutic concentrations.
