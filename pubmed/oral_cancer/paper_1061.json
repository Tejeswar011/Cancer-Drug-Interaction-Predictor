Introduction: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is sixth most common cancer in Indian subcontinent with a high morbidity and mortality rate. It is frequently preceded by oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD). Early diagnosis of OSCC might halt the poor prognosis. Therefore, present study was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic significance of preoperative hematological parameters and serum lipid indices in OSCCs and OPMDs. Material and Methods: Study included 75 cases each of OSCC, OPMD, and controls. Mean and standard deviation of various hematological and lipid parameters were evaluated, including: a) RBC metrics b) WBC metrics c) Platelet metrics: d) Lipid metrics: Result: Mean values of neutrophil count, immature leucocytic cells, NLR, MPV, PDWSD, PLCR, and VLDL were found to be significantly increased ( P P Conclusion: Present study findings corroborate the role of hematological and serum lipid profile parameters in the etiology and progression of OPMDs and OSCCs. This highlights their potential as early diagnostic predictive markers to forecast the occurrence of high-risk OPMD and OSCC cases and also guiding personalized treatment strategies.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted at the unit of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Dental Sciences, with 225 enrolled patients aged between 18 and 80 years. The sample size was calculated using OpenEpi version 3.0 software, based on data from a prior study by Sai SK et al 12 The study population was divided into three groups: Group I: Group II: Group III: Methodology Routine blood investigations and serum lipid profile analysis involved the collection of 5 ml of blood under sterile conditions from all the study participants. 2.5 ml of blood was collected into ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)-containing vacutainers for routine blood investigations, while the remaining 2.5 ml was allowed to clot for 1 hour at room temperature. The clotted blood was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes, and the serum obtained was stored at 4 degrees Celsius for subsequent lipid profile estimation.[ 5 The whole blood sample collected in EDTA-containing vacutainers was used for the analysis of hematological parameters, including a): RBC parameters—red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin percentage (Hb%), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV-measures average size of RBC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), RDW cell volume (RDWCV)/standard deviation (RDWSD), b): WBC parameters—white blood cell count (WBCC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, basophil, atypical lymphocytes, large immature leucocytic cells, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Additionally, c): platelet parameters—include absolute platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV—measures average size of PLT), PDW standard deviation (PDWSD), PCT, platelet large cell ratio (PLCR-is an indicator of circulating larger platelets (>12fL). These hematological analyses were performed using a 5-part hematology machine (ERBA-H 560). The lipid profile included the assessment of total cholesterol (TC), TG, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), VLDL, and Non-HDL analyzed using a semi-automatic analyzer. The data collected was subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using a Microsoft Excel worksheet and SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). As the data were quantitative, the level of significance was set at 5%. To compare the hematological and lipid profiles among three groups, one-way ANOVA was used followed by post hoc RESULT A total of 225 participants were included in the study with 150 cases (75 OSCC and 75 OPMDs) and 75 controls. Among 75 OSCC cases, 61 were males and 14 were females similarly in OPMDs out of 75 cases, 65 were males and 10 were females with a male: female ratio of 4.36:1 and 6.5:1, respectively. The mean age of OSCC and OPMDs was 50.21 ± 11.70 and 40.55 ± 13.71 years, respectively. Buccal mucosa was the most frequent site of involvement in both OSCC and OPMD groups. The most common predisposing risk factor was tobacco followed by smoking and alcohol. In the present study, while appraising RBC indices, it was observed that the mean values of RBC count and Hb% were decreased among the OSCC and OPMD groups and showed a significant difference ( P P P Table 1 Table 1 Depicting the association of red blood cell indices in group 1 (control) group 2 (oral squamous cell carcinoma) and group 3 (oral potential malignant disorders) Variables Group Mean Standard deviation  P RBC 1 4.96 0.65 0.022 2 4.63 1.05 3 4.59 0.89 Hb 1 14.99 1.68 0.053 2 13.96 3.43 3 14.12 2.84 HCT 1 42.77 4.78 0.122 2 40.46 9.51 3 40.36 9.06 MCV 1 87.47 5.62 0.689 2 88.25 7.25 3 88.57 10.35 MCH 1 30.69 2.35 0.843 2 31.17 7.62 3 31.01 3.64 RDWCV 1 13.01 0.88 0.427 2 13.21 1.43 3 13.30 1.62 RDWSD 1 47.05 5.03 0.506 2 47.91 4.63 3 48.19 8.23 A P In evaluating the WBC parameters, the mean values of neutrophils, large immature leucocytic cells, and NLR were found to be significantly increased ( P P P Moreover, on intergroup comparison, mean neutrophils, lymphocytes, and NLR values showed a statistically significant difference between OPMD and OSCC groups ( P P P Table 2 Table 2 Illustrates the association of White blood cell indices in group 1 (control) group 2 (oral squamous cell carcinoma) and group 3 (oral potential malignant disorders) Variables Group Mean Standard deviation  P White blood cell 1 6.90 2.84 0.390 2 7.34 2.82 3 6.79 2.07 Neutrophil 1 62.19 15.91 0.019 2 64.53 10.14 3 58.93 9.25 Lymphocyte 1 26.04 8.98 <0.001 2 26.01 9.09 3 31.80 7.83 Monocyte 1 6.59 5.75 0.229 2 6.17 3.31 3 5.46 2.22 Eosinophil 1 5.69 17.09 0.186 2 3.24 2.80 3 2.91 2.58 Basophil 1 2.16 5.92 0.015 2 0.69 0.38 3 0.79 0.41 Atypical lymphocytes 1 1.90 3.16 0.03 2 0.98 1.01 3 1.49 1.66 Large immature leucocytic cells 1 0.05 0.05 0.049 2 0.08 0.12 3 0.07 0.07 NLR 1 2.91 1.49 <0.001 2 2.95 1.51 3 2.04 1.08 A P In considering the platelet parameters, the mean value of platelet count was observed to be significantly decreased ( P P P P P P Table 3 Table 3 Depicting the association of platelet indices in group 1 (control) group 2 (oral squamous cell carcinoma) and group 3 (oral potential malignant disorders) Variables Group Mean Standard deviation  P PLT 1 255.70 62.46 <0.001 2 213.01 107.95 3 190.88 80.64 MPV 1 9.37 1.19 <0.001 2 10.97 1.26 3 11.53 1.44 PDWSD 1 12.34 4.11 <0.001 2 16.85 4.62 3 18.35 5.02 PCT 1 0.23 0.05 0.312 2 0.22 0.10 1 0.21 0.08 PLCR 1 32.05 9.04 <0.001 2 45.10 9.90 3 48.25 11.74 A P On assessing the lipid indices, the mean values of TC, TG, LDL, and Non-HDL revealed a non-significant difference ( P P P Further, the intergroup comparison of mean HDL value, showed a highly significant difference between control and OSCC groups ( P P Table 4 Table 4 Demonstrates the association of lipid indices in group 1 (control) group 2 (oral squamous cell carcinoma) and group 3 (oral potential malignant disorders) Variables Group Mean Standard deviation  P Total Cholesterol 1 180.79 42.99 0.559 2 175.56 36.71 3 182.37 42.12 Triglycerides 1 143.99 56.84 0.165 2 163.12 78.57 3 164.79 83.47 HDL 1 49.00 18.46 0.001 2 40.96 9.79 3 44.87 10.10 LDL 1 103.93 34.09 0.686 2 100.77 28.10 3 105.02 31.50 VLDL 1 25.72 7.76 0.002 2 33.18 16.93 3 32.22 15.27 Non-HDL 1 131.84 36.27 0.862 2 134.71 36.27 3 134.93 43.09 A P DISCUSSION OPMDs are recognized as having a heightened propensity for progressing into OSCC, with reported malignant transformation rates ranging from 5% to 36% over observation periods extending up to 30 years.[ 11 13 13 1 14 10 RBC parameters In complete blood count analysis, the interactions of various RBC indices such as RBC count, Hb%, HCT, MCV, MCH, RDWCV, and RDWSD were found to be ambiguous with OSCC progression in previous studies.[ 15 16 17 et al 18 et al 19 P 20 et al 21 et al 22 According to previous studies, anemia (reduction in Hb%-less than 13.5 g/dL in men; less than 12.0 g/dL in women or HCT-less than 41.0% in men; less than 36.0% in women or RBC count) observed in OSCC patients might reflect chronic inflammation or malnutrition induced by progression of malignant transformation.[ 17 18 et al 23 et al 24 Other RBC indices including HCT, MCV, MCH, RDWCV, and RDWSD exhibited non-significant differences ( P et al 19 et al 8 25 WBC parameters The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in the progression of carcinogenesis.[ 26 27 P P et al 9 et al 28 et al 29 Conversely, other WBC indices such as WBC and monocyte counts did not show any notable alterations in the present study. However, Tsai et al 29 et al 30 These findings substantiate the evidence of immunosuppression in OSCC and underscore the relationship between immune cells and the malignant transformation of oral epithelium, corroborating that immune cells (increase in neutrophil count, large immature leukocytic cells, and decrease in lymphocytes, basophils, and atypical lymphocytes), and inflammatory metrics (NLR) are instrumental in identifying the disease progression of OPMDs and OSCC.[ 9 26 27 28 29 30 Platelet parameters As integral components of the tumor microenvironment, platelets are envisioned to play a multifaceted role in inflammation-induced tumor progression and metastasis, beyond their traditional functions in hemostasis and coagulation in OSCC.[ 10 P et al 10 et al 31 The result of the present study also showed a significant decrease ( P et al 10 et al 31 et al 32 10 31 PCT values were similar across all groups in our study, consistent with Kannar V et al 10 et al 31 All these observations, i.e., increased platelet activation (↑MPV, ↑PLCR), increased volume variability (↑PDWSD), and a decreased platelet count (↓platelet), indicating alterations in platelet count, morphology, and function in both OPMDs and OSCC. Thus, platelets are implicated in the inflammation-mediated pathogenesis of OPMDs and OSCC,[ 10 31 32 Lipid parameters Lipids are essential for the structural and functional integrity of cell membranes and are crucial for the metabolic activities of both normal and malignant cells. They also play a role in stabilizing the DNA helix.[ 33 P et al 34 et al 35 In literature exploration, most studies[ 34 35 36 37 38 et al 39 et al 39 P P In the present study, we found a non-significant ( P et al 11 Altogether these findings suggest that low cholesterol levels (TC, HDL, LDL) might be associated with a greater risk of malignant transformation. Additionally, lipid mobilizing factor (LMF) and tumor factor zinc-alpha-2 glycoprotein induce increased lipolysis in the early stages of cancer, leading to the elevated production of TG, which is subsequently used for VLDL production which enters the bloodstream. This potentially explains the observed increase in TG and VLDL levels in the OPMDs and OSCC patients in the present study.[ 40 However, further researches using a larger sample size with determination and validation of an optimal cut-off levels of these parameters is paramount which could better illuminate the prognostic significance of these parameters. CONCLUSION Evaluation of hematological parameters and lipid indices is a relatively unexplored arena of research among OPMDs and OSCC cases. The findings of the present study revealed a significant increase in neutrophil count, immature leucocytic cells, NLR, MPV, PDWSD, PLCR, and VLDL parameters while there is a significant decrease in RBC count, Hb%, lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, platelet, and HDL parameters among OPMDs and OSCC groups, establishing them as a potential predictive markers to forecast the occurrence of OPMDs and OSCC. Keeping this in mind, pre-operative evaluation of hematological parameters and lipid indices could be employed as a non-invasive, inexpensive, screening tool and early diagnostic parameters in detecting high-risk-OPMDs and OSCC. This might open up a new arena of research which could further target such cells in tumor immunotherapy.
