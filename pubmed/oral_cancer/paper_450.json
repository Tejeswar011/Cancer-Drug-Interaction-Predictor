The individuals were all between the ages of 18 and 80, diagnosed with gastric cancer and required surgical intervention. 122 patients were eliminated for the reasons mentioned in Fig. 1 12 1 https://www.chictr.org.cn/ For all patients scheduled for gastrectomy, nutritional risk screening using the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) was performed within 24 h of admission. Patients without preoperative nutritional risk (NRS 2002 < 3) received no immediate nutritional intervention but underwent repeat NRS 2002 assessment after one week. Those identified with nutritional risk (NRS 2002 ≥ 3) were provided nutritional support, preferably via oral enteral nutrition. Postoperatively, both cohorts were maintained nil per os (NPO), with nutritional support transitioning from parenteral nutrition (PN) to enteral nutrition (EN), ultimately advancing to oral intake. All patients received intravenous vitamin administration, including one bottle of Water-soluble Vitamin for Injection and one bottle of Fat-Soluble Vitamin Injection (II). A standardized perioperative management regimen and identical intravenous vitamin administration protocol were maintained for both patient cohorts throughout the study period.

Assessment of vitamin level The vitamin levels of the subjects were examined by electrochemical method (LK3000V, Lanbiao, Tianjin, China) in the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital.

This analysis compared whether there were differences in vitamin levels between the oral multivitamin preparation group and the non-oral multivitamin preparation group under the conditions of the same surgical procedure. There were 40 total gastrectomy patients and 38 partial gastrectomy patients.

In patients at high risk of folic acid deficiency, further measures such as oral folic acid supplementation or food fortification should be used to correct the folic acid deficiency status 24 12 12 25 12 12 1 26 1 1 1 27 1 1 20 21 The lack of oral vitamin supplement absorption due to altered digestion and impaired nutrition absorption may develop following total or subtotal gastrectomy. The vitamin deficiencies are attributed to malabsorption, rapid gastrointestinal transit time and bacterial overgrowth 17 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 The timing of the onset of each of these vitamin deficiencies may be related to the time it takes to deplete the body’s stores of each vitamin. When folic acid is not ingested in the diet by those with adequate nutritional status, the body’s storage capacity can be maintained for at least 3 months without deficiency 28 12 12 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 29 30 1 31 1 1 1 1 1 32 1 1 1 At the same time, in a multi-center study of 2173 healthy adults from five cities in China 33 Due to the deficiency of folic acid storage in vivo for about 3 months 34 1 Conclusion Systematic multivitamin supplementation should be routinely administered to Chinese gastric cancer patients following gastrectomy, with particular emphasis on initiating vitamin B 1 1 Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
