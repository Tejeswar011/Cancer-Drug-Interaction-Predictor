To investigate the significance of serum periostin concentrations in dogs with cAD, this study examined their relationship with disease severity and laboratory parameters, including eosinophil counts and Th2 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. A total of 68 dogs diagnosed with cAD and 21 healthy controls were included, with serum periostin, IL-4, and IL-13 levels measured. Disease severity was assessed using the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI-04) and the Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (PVAS). The results showed that serum periostin concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with cAD compared to healthy controls and exhibited a positive correlation with CADESI-04 scores, reflecting disease severity. Treatment with prednisolone or oclacitinib led to a significant reduction in serum periostin, IL-4, and IL-13 levels, along with a decrease in eosinophil counts. These findings highlight the potential of serum periostin as a valuable biomarker for assessing cAD severity and monitoring treatment response, emphasizing its clinical relevance as an objective measure.

This disease typically involves immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies reacting to environmental allergens and is associated with distinct clinical signs (Halliwell 2006 2019 1998 2009 2025 1999 2002 2002 2011 2016 2018 2015 Periostin, a member of the fasciclin family, is an extracellular matrix protein that regulates cellular functions by binding to integrin molecules on the cell surface (Morra and Moch 2011 2014 1993 2009 2010 2012 2012 2012 2014 2014 2017 Several studies have reported that the periostin gene is highly expressed in the skin lesions of cAD, similar to observations in human AD (Mineshige et al. 2015 2018 Materials and methods Serum sampling Serum periostin concentrations were assessed using serum samples obtained from dogs with cAD as well as healthy dogs visiting the clinic for routine vaccinations or examinations presented at the Chonnam national university veterinary teaching hospital and local animal hospitals in Republic of Korea. All blood samples were collected at the time of first presentation. Serum was separated by centrifugation at 4,000 RPM for 5 min within 1 h of collection and stored at −20 °C for less than one year until analysis. Approval for the experimental design was granted by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university under approval number CNU IACUC-YB-2024-61. Animals The group allocation was as follows: 68 dogs were included in the cAD group, among which 20 dogs were further classified into the remission group based on the CADESI-04 system. Meanwhile, the cAD treatment group consisted of 20 dogs, of which 3 had been previously included in the cAD group. The cAD group ( n Malassezia 2010 2015 At the first presentation, except for cAD remission group, all cAD dogs were excluded if the following treatment washout periods had not been confirmed by history: anti-inflammatory or antipruritic drugs within 2 weeks; corticosteroid medication by oral or topic route within 4 weeks. Most dogs diagnosed with cAD underwent assessment of the Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index-04 (CADESI-04) score and the pruritus visual analog scale (PVAS) score. The CADESI-04 score was evaluated by at least two veterinarians, meaning that the investigators were not always the same individuals. The PVAS score was recorded based on a formal visual analog scale, which was presented to the owner during the visit and marked directly by the owner. According to the previous study (Olivry et al. 2014 The cAD remission group ( n The healthy control group ( n 2016 2018 2019 The cAD treatment group ( n Measurement of serum biomarkers and eosinophil counts Measurements of serum periostin concentrations Anti-canine periostin monoclonal antibody was pre-coated on ELISA plates; then, via 2 p < ELISA for IL-4 and IL-13 To measure the concentrations of IL-4 and IL-13, specific canine ELISA kits (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA) were used. Similar to the measurement of periostin, each assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Eosinophil count measurement A complete blood cell count analyzer (Procyte Dx Analyzer, IDEXX Veterinary Diagnostics, USA) was used to measure hematological parameters. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26, IBM Corp., USA) and GraphPad Prism (version 10.2, GraphPad Software Inc., USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to evaluate the normality of the data. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to analyzed difference in serum periostin concentrations, IL-4 and IL-13 levels, and eosinophil counts between dogs with cAD and healthy controls. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare among the control group and cAD group based on CADESI-04 scores (mild group and moderate-to-severe group). In this study, the moderate and severe groups were combined for statistical analysis. Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to evaluate associations between serum periostin concentrations and the CADESI-04 score, PVAS score, eosinophil count, and IL-4 and IL-13 levels in cAD group followed by Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted to confirm associations between serum periostin level and IL-13 in healthy control group, while Spearman’s correlation analysis was done to confirm between periostin and IL-4, eosinophil count. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to compare serum periostin concentrations, IL-4 and IL-13 levels, and eosinophil counts between pre-treatment and post-treatment in dogs with cAD. Results Study population Sixty-eight dogs diagnosed with cAD were included in this study. The ages of the animals ranged from 1 to 12 years, with a mean age of 7.5 ± 3.1 years. The group consisted of 40 females, 35 of which were spayed, and 28 males, 25 of which were neutered. Twelve breeds were represented, with Maltese and Poodles being the largest groups including 18 and 14 dogs, respectively ( Table 1 n Table 1. Signalments of all dogs included in the study.

The control group consisted of 21 dogs, with ages ranging from 1 to 15 years, with a mean age of 7.3 ± 3.7 years. This group included 10 females (all spayed) and 14 males (12 neutered). The most represented breed was the Maltese ( Table 1 Among the samples from the cAD and healthy control groups in which serum periostin concentrations were quantified, Th2-related cytokines were additionally measured in samples with sufficient volume for further analysis. IL-4 was measured in total 74 dogs (cAD = 55, healthy = 19), and IL-13 was measured in total 71 dogs (cAD = 52, healthy = 19). In addition, eosinophil count data were obtained from total 56 dogs (cAD = 42, healthy = 14) with available CBC records through medical chart review. Comparison of serum periostin concentrations and other biomarkers in dogs with cAD and healthy dogs Dogs with cAD exhibited significantly higher median serum periostin concentrations than healthy dogs (median, 13.51 ng/mL; IQR, 6.801–21.21 versus median, 8.044 ng/mL; IQR, 1.086–12.52; p Figure 1A p Figure 1B,C p Figure 1D Figure 1.

Statistical significance was determined using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, with **p ***p ****p Discussion Recent findings have underscored the pivotal role of periostin in the pathophysiology of AD, particularly in conjunction with cytokines such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-4 (Majewska et al. 2016 2021 2014 2015 This study highlights the utility of serum periostin concentration as a potential objective marker for assessing the severity of cAD. Previous studies have examined the relationship between lesion severity scores in cAD and various biomarkers such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor, IL-17, and IL-31 levels (Chaudhary et al. 2019 2019 2014 2017 2021 2021 AD primarily develops through the activation of Th2 cells following the transdermal entry of allergens, which subsequently leads to the release of Th2-associated cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 (Grewe et al. 1998 2011 2012 2019 2006 2012 2012 2019 We demonstrated that serum periostin concentrations decreased in dogs treated with PDS or oclacitinib, the first-line therapies for cAD, corresponding with clinical improvement. Currently, the evaluation of therapeutic responses in dogs with cAD primarily relies on subjective assessments performed either by veterinarians evaluating clinical signs or by owners rating the severity of pruritus in their dogs. Thus, this study is particularly interesting as it provides an objective method to assess treatment responses. Furthermore, we concurrently evaluated changes in IL-4 and IL-13 levels and eosinophil counts post-treatment, which are closely associated with Th2 inflammation. Both glucocorticoids and oclacitinib are known to inhibit Th2 cells (Richards et al. 2000 2021 This study was subject to several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the marked disparity in sample size between the control group and the cAD cohort may have introduced bias, potentially influencing the study outcomes. Second, the retrospective design limited the availability of blood examination data and residual samples for dogs with cAD, preventing a comprehensive analysis across all subjects such as additional measurement of pruritic cytokines (IL-31) associated with cAD. Third, despite the well-established correlation between the chronicity of AD and serum periostin concentrations in human medicine (Kou et al. 2014 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to investigate the relationship between serum periostin concentrations and cAD severity. This study demonstrated that serum periostin is a valuable potential biomarker for objectively assessing the severity of disease and treatment response in cAD. Our findings provide four key insights into the role of periostin in cAD. First, serum periostin concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with cAD than in healthy controls. Second, there was a positive correlation between serum periostin concentrations and disease severity. Third, serum periostin concentrations in cAD group were associated with Th-2 cytokine, IL-4 level. Finally, serum periostin concentrations decreased significantly following treatment, highlighting the potential utility of serum periostin as a dynamic biomarker for monitoring therapeutic responses. These results emphasize the potential of serum periostin as a reliable measure for monitoring disease progression and evaluating therapeutic outcomes in cAD that can provide supplementary support to subjective scoring systems commonly used in clinical practice. Future studies with larger, prospectively collected datasets are needed to validate and expand upon these results. Nonetheless, this research marks a significant advancement in the objective evaluation of cAD severity and treatment efficacy.
