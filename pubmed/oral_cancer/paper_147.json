In particular, the involvement of type I toxin – antitoxin (TA) systems – bacterial genetic elements that modulate dormancy by encoding a stable toxin and a labile antitoxin – has attracted interest as potential mediators of bacterial persistence [ 5 25 H. pylori H. pylori H. pylori Coccoid formation: Triggers and morphological transition The conversion of H. pylori 26 27 28–30 H. pylori 31 32 33 33 34 The transition from helical to coccoid form appears to proceed through a continuum of intermediate morphotypes – curved rods, U-shaped cells, and ultimately spherical forms – suggesting a temporally regulated, rather than abrupt, transformation [ 35 36 37 38 39 Table 1 Table 1. Factors inducing coccoid formation in H. pylori. Inducing Study details Confirmation methods Key findings Reference Nutrient starvation H. pylori Fluorescence microscopy with SYTO9 and propidium iodide staining; proteomic analysis Viable coccoid forms observed; proteomic differences noted between spiral and coccoid forms, indicating metabolic adaptations [ 40 Antibiotic exposure Treatment of H. pylori Fluorescence microscopy; culturability on chocolate agar plates; proteomic analysis; flow cytometry; viability assays; susceptibility testing Rapid transition to coccoid forms; distinct proteomic profiles compared to spiral forms, suggesting antibiotic-induced stress response mechanisms; coccoid forms exhibited resistance to amoxicillin, indicating potential challenges in eradication therapies [ 41 Streptococcus mitis Co-culture of H. pylori S. mitis Fluorescence microscopy; Gram staining; proteomic analysis. S. mitis H. pylori S. mitis [ 42 Anaerobic conditions Incubation of H. pylori Scanning electron microscopy; Western blot analysis; urease activity assays Transition from helical to coccoid and fragmented forms; coccoid forms retained expression of virulence factors (e.g. CagA BabA [ 8 Aerobic conditions Transfer of H. pylori Scanning electron microscopy; culturability Rapid conversion to coccoid forms; initial presence of U-shaped and doughnut-shaped intermediates; prolonged aerobiosis led to degraded forms, indicating oxygen-induced stress response [ 43 Cold stress H. pylori ATP measurement; mRNA detection of vacA ureA ATP detectable up to 25 days; mRNA expression of vacA ureA [ 44 Acid stress Exposure of H. pylori Survival; morphological observation Morphological changes correlated with decreased acid resistance; addition of urea enhanced survival, emphasizing the role of urease in acid resistance [ 45 Oxidative stress (H₂O₂) Exposure of H. pylori Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; mass spectrometry; RT-PCR Differential expression of stress response proteins, including superoxide dismutase and urease G; indicates involvement of reactive oxygen species in coccoid transformation. [ 46 Prolonged incubation Extended culture of H. pylori Scanning electron microscopy; culturability Morphological transformation from spiral to coccoid forms; loss of culturability; coccoid forms exhibited rougher surfaces and tended to aggregate, suggesting cell wall degeneration [ 43 Broth media incubation Growth of H. pylori Scanning electron microscopy; urease activity assays Rapid growth observed with transition to coccoid forms after 18 hours; coccoid forms initially lost urease activity but could revert to spiral forms with recovery of urease activity upon subculture in fresh broth [ 47 Intriguingly, electron-dense granules – identified as polyphosphate inclusions – have been observed within certain coccoid forms, supporting a dormancy model wherein these structures may act as metabolic reservoirs during prolonged survival [ 6 11 48 49 H. pylori Viability and persistence of the coccoid form The viability of coccoid H. pylori 48 50 51 48 19 52 10 44 53 37 53 54 The VBNC state, characterized by metabolic activity without culturability on standard media, offers a compelling framework for reconciling these observations [ 55 56 H. pylori 57 19 48 58 48 59 H. pylori 19 60 29 H. pylori 61 49 H. pylori 27 28 62 Specifically, a study has shown that the coccoid form of H. pylori 62 29 H. pylori H. pylori 63 uppS pgdA 52 53 Molecular mechanisms behind coccoid formation The transition of H. pylori 64 65 H. pylori 5 66 67–69 70 71 3 72 73–75 There are two main theories about how coccoid forms arise. One suggests that simply loosening the PGN allows internal pressure to push the cell into a spherical shape [ 48 74 59 H. pylori 76 77 A particularly exciting development is the discovery of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, especially the AapA1/IsoA1 pair, as a trigger for coccoid formation [ 25 78 74 78 79 H. pylori 80 25 H. pylori 81 82 83 84 85 86 H. pylori H. pylori 87 Bactericidal antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, induce oxidative stress, which activates TA systems and promotes coccoid formation. This morphological shift may reduce the bacteria’s susceptibility to antibiotics by lowering metabolic activity, making it harder for antibiotics to target active cellular processes. This mechanism could explain why H. pylori 41 88 89 25 90 Table 2 H. pylori Table 2. Molecular players in coccoid formation of H. pylori. Component Role Effect on Morphology Mechanism Reference PBP1 PGN synthesis and remodeling Depletion leads to spherical cells Involved in the final stages of PGN biosynthesis; its absence disrupts cell wall integrity, resulting in coccoid forms. [ 91 PBP2 PGN synthesis and maintenance of rod shape Disruption results in coccoid morphology Essential for maintaining helical shape; its inhibition leads to loss of rod shape and coccoid transformation. [ 91 PBP3 Cell division Altered function contributes to spherical shape Plays a role in septal PGN synthesis during cell division; mutations can impair division, leading to coccoid forms. [ 91 Csd1 PGN hydrolase (LytM-related endopeptidase) Modulates helical curvature; disruption leads to straight or curved rods Cleaves specific PGN cross-links, contributing to cell shape determination [ 70 Csd2 Putative PGN hydrolase regulator Works with Csd1; its absence affects cell shape Forms a complex with Csd1, stabilizing its function in PGN remodeling. [ 70 Csd3/HdpA PGN hydrolase (D,D-endopeptidase and D,D-carboxypeptidase) Overexpression accelerates coccoid formation; deletion delays or prevents it Dual enzymatic activity relaxes PGN structure, facilitating shape changes. [ 70 Csd4 Carboxypeptidase Alters PGN composition; impacts cell curvature Trims PGN peptides, influencing cell wall flexibility and shape. [ 70 Csd6 Carboxypeptidase Affects helical shape; its loss leads to straight rods Modifies PGN peptides, contributing to maintenance of helical morphology. [ 70 MreB Actin-like cytoskeletal protein Disruption leads to loss of helical shape Coordinates PGN synthesis machinery; its dysfunction results in abnormal cell shapes, including coccoid forms. [ 76 CcmA Cytoskeletal protein Loss results in straight rods; contributes to coccoid formation when combined with hydrolase activity Influences cell wall synthesis patterns, essential for maintaining helical shape. [ 92 AapA1 (Toxin) Type I toxin of TA system Overexpression induces rapid coccoid transformation Targets the inner membrane, disrupting membrane potential and ATP synthesis, leading to morphological changes.

These include defining the precise conditions that facilitate coccoid resuscitation, disentangling the respective contributions of PGN remodeling versus TA systems, and determining the true prevalence of coccoids in recurrent infections. Emerging yet feasible tools – such as transcriptomic profiling via bulk RNA sequencing under defined stress conditions to characterize gene expression dynamics during coccoid transition and resuscitation, and organoid-based infection models that recapitulate the human gastric microenvironment to assess coccoid survival, immune evasion, and antibiotic tolerance – offer promising avenues to address these gaps. As a future direction, targeted therapeutic strategies could be developed to specifically disrupt coccoid formation, persistence, or resuscitation. For example, inhibition of peptidoglycan-modifying enzymes such as AmiA and Csd3—key mediators of cell wall remodeling – has been shown to impair coccoid conversion and sensitize H. pylori H. pylori H. pylori Acknowledgements We sincerely express our gratitude to all the members of the Basic and Molecular Epidemiology of Gastrointestinal Disorders Research Center, Research Institute for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.
