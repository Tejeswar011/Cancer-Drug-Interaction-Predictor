Although vaccination is the primary\nstrategy for preventing viral infections, the rapid evolution of viruses and their\ndivergence from existing vaccines limit vaccine efficacy. Therefore, novel and safe\nalternatives to combat viral infections are urgently needed. Probiotic-derived\nextracellular vesicles (PEVs), lipid bilayer-enclosed nanoparticles, exhibit potential as\nsafe alternatives to live bacteria for treating viral diseases. These vesicles deliver\nantiviral molecules through mechanisms such as blocking viral adsorption/invasion and\nmodulating host immune responses. This review systematically summarizes the biological\ncharacteristics of PEVs, their antiviral mechanisms, and their potential applications\nagainst respiratory, enteric, and enveloped viruses. Additionally, recent advances in\nengineering strategies, clinical translation challenges, and future directions for PEVs\nare discussed. probiotics extracellular vesicles viral infection viruses inter-kingdom communication pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes INTRODUCTION The global burden of viral infections, including influenza [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Probiotic-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) are nano-sized particles actively secreted\nby probiotics via membrane budding or outer membrane shedding. These vesicles encapsulate\ndiverse bioactive components from parental bacteria, including proteins, lipids, and\nmetabolites, which mediate beneficial effects on the host [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 This review aims to systematically summarize the multi-dimensional antiviral mechanisms of\nPEVs, evaluate their potential against enveloped, non-enveloped, and emerging viruses, and\ndiscuss engineering strategies and clinical translation pathways. The obtained insights may\nprovide novel theoretical foundations and technological directions for antiviral\ntherapy. BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PEVS Structure and composition PEVs are lipid bilayer-enclosed nanoparticles released by probiotics, typically ranging\nin diameter from 20 to 400 nm. Their cargo, including proteins, nucleic acids,\nmetabolites, and signaling molecules, is stably delivered to host cells under vesicle\nmembrane protection [ 15 16 17 Structurally, these vesicles consist of a lipid bilayer derived from probiotic cell\nmembranes or outer membranes, containing phospholipids, lipoproteins, and minimal\ntransmembrane proteins. These components exhibit low immunogenicity, as they are not\nrecognized as foreign by the host immune system [ 18 19 Lactobacillus in\nvitro in vivo 15 20 21 22 23 11 14 24 25 26 These attributes position PEVs as a safe antiviral therapeutic strategy, capable of\nefficiently delivering bioactive molecules while minimizing systemic side effects. Biogenesis and secretion PEVs are primarily derived from probiotic cell membranes or walls and are released into\nthe extracellular environment via membrane budding or cell wall lysis [ 27 Lactobacillus 28 29 30 31 32 Lacticaseibacillus\nrhamnosus 25 Lactiplantibacillus\nplantarum 33 Functional properties PEVs exhibit multifunctional properties, primarily mediated through inter-kingdom\ncommunication, immune modulation, metabolic regulation, and therapeutic intervention\n[ 34 35 36 Bifidobacterium\nlongum 37 Akkermansia muciniphila 38 Lactobacillus acidophilus L. plantarum E. coli 39 Escherichia\ncoli 40 Lactobacillus johnsonii 41 L. plantarum 42 23 43 44 Collectively, these functional properties highlight the broad applicability of PEVs in\nanti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, and metabolic therapies. Emerging\nevidence further underscores their antiviral potential, warranting detailed\nexploration. ANTIVIRAL MECHANISMS OF PEVS Blocking viral replication and adsorption Viral infection initiates with host cell surface attachment; disrupting this step reduces\nthe viral load, mitigates cytopathic effects, delays disease progression, and enhance host\ndefense through immune regulation [ 45 Lactobacillus + Lactobacillus 46 Enterobacter cloacae Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 12 Modulating host immune responses Activating immune signaling pathways PEVs can exert antiviral effects by activating host immune signaling pathways, which\nmainly involve their regulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and activation\nof downstream signaling cascades. They carry immunostimulatory molecules such as\nToll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1)\nligands that directly interact with host immune cells [ 47 48 B.\nlongum L. plantarum 49 The gut harbors the majority of lymphoid tissues and immune cells in the human body,\nserving as a critical organ for defense against external invaders. Trillions of\ncommensal microorganisms residing in the gut play a pivotal role in modulating host\nantiviral immune responses [ 50 51 48 Balancing inflammatory cytokines Balancing inflammatory cytokines by coordinating pro- and anti-inflammatory responses\nto suppress viral replication and mitigate immunopathological damage is critical in\nantiviral mechanisms [ 52 Lactobacillus 53 Regulating monocyte differentiation Monocytes are highly plastic cells whose differentiation and functions are tightly\nregulated by microenvironmental cues. The intricate interplay between the regulation of\nmonocyte differentiation and antiviral immunity centers on monocytes differentiating\ninto subtypes such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which exert dual functional\nroles in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity [ 54 55 Lacticaseibacillus casei 56 Activate innate immunity Martínez-Ruiz et al. 57 58 Delivering functional molecules to modulate antiviral responses PEVs carry bioactive components such as nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites [ 59 Limosilactobacillus reuteri 53 E. coli 51 L. johnsonii 11 in\nvitro in vivo ENGINEERING AND DELIVERY STRATEGIES As the antiviral mechanisms of PEVs become clearer, their antiviral efficacy may also be\nsignificantly improved through engineering modifications and delivery strategy optimization.\nThe engineering of bacterial EVs involves modifying both EV-producing strains and preformed\nEVs, aiming to improve EV production, immunogenicity, and targeting capability. At present, engineered PEVs have been successfully applied in antigen delivery. Researchers\nhave developed a delivery system based on PEVs co-delivering the receptor-binding domain of\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and the\nnon-glycosylated NG06 antigen, demonstrating robust immunogenicity and safety. In the\nfuture, vaccines can be constructed with systems that make use of a secondary deliver system\n[ 60 In addition, genetic engineering techniques can enhance the EV secretion capacity.\nModifying and knocking out genes related to processes of the cell envelope can increase the\nproduction of EVs [ 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 Bacterial EVs exhibit intrinsic targeting abilities, delivering molecules to distal organs\nvia the oral intestinal axis or systemic circulation and eliciting specific cellular\nresponses [ 68 E.\ncoli 47 L. johnsonii Lactobacillus 69 Future efforts are needed to address challenges related to PEV drug-loading efficiency, in vivo CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS Research on PEVs as novel biotherapeutics has rapidly expanded in recent years. These\nnanoscale vesicles have unique cross-species communication capabilities and can achieve\ntargeted delivery of bioactive molecules through various pathways, such as membrane fusion\nand endocytosis [ 17 Fig.\n1 Fig. 1. Antiviral effect and mechanism of probiotic-derived extracellular vesicles\n(PEVs). (1) PEVs can block viral adhesion and internalization by competing with viruses for\nhost cell binding sites. (2) PEVs enhance host immune responses by modulating immune\nsignaling pathways, regulating monocyte differentiation, and activating immune cells.\n(3) PEV secretes bioactive substances with antiviral activity, such as DNA, proteins,\nand sRNAs. The current evidence for the direct antiviral effects of PEVs primarily stems from in vitro In terms of large-scale production, it is difficult to meet industrial needs with the\ntraditional high-speed centrifugation method due to its low yield and time-consuming energy\nconsumption. Development of new technologies, such as microfluidics and tangential flow\nfiltration, is urgently needed to increase yields and reduce costs [ 70 L. plantarum Limosilactobacillus fermentum Lactobacillus\ngasseri 34 71 For clinical translation, while PEVs are inherently safe, the potential risks of their\nlong-term use (such as immunogenicity fluctuations and gut microbiota disorders) still need\nto be evaluated through long-term animal toxicity experiments and dynamic human microbiome\nmonitoring systems. In addition, PEVs themselves are fragile and easily degradable, and\ntheir stability in the gastrointestinal tract and ability to accumulate at the site of\ninfection need to be improved through like lipid encapsulation or surface modifications\n(such as adhesin coupling). Future directions of research may focus on engineered\nmodifications and synergistic therapies [ 72 The appeal of probiotic-derived EVs lies in their unique advantages and therapeutic\npotential. Future research must prioritize resolving challenges in standardized production,\ntargeting optimization, and safety evaluation to advance their application in antiviral\ntherapeutics.
