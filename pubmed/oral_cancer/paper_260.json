Here, we report results of 5 phase 1 studies that assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and skin irritation and sensitization potential of clascoterone cream 1% in healthy participants and patients with acne. Studies CB‐03‐01/02 (EudraCT: 2007‐005064‐28) and CB‐03‐01/04 (n = 24 each) assessed PK in healthy participants. Study 171‐7151‐203 (n = 8) assessed steady‐state PK in patients with acne. Studies CB‐03‐01/05 (n = 36) and CB‐03‐01/32 (n = 250) assessed skin irritation and sensitization potential, respectively, in healthy participants. Systemic exposure to clascoterone was low after repeated daily application for up to 42 days of treatment. Clascoterone was excreted in urine as conjugated esters at a ≤1% fraction of the administered dose. Adverse events and local skin reactions were generally mild/moderate and reversible. No clinically relevant changes were observed in laboratory tests and vital signs. Skin irritation and sensitization with clascoterone treatment were minimal. Phase 1 study findings supported low systemic absorption of clascoterone and a favorable safety profile after topical application of clascoterone cream 1%, with no evidence of irritation or sensitization. acne clascoterone pharmacokinetics sensitization skin irritation pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025 Acne vulgaris is the 8th most common disease in the world, with an estimated global prevalence across all ages of 9.4%.  1 Cutibacterium acnes  2  3  4  5 2  6 Clascoterone (cortexolone 17α‐propionate) is a topical androgen receptor inhibitor that binds to androgen receptors with high affinity. In vitro, clascoterone inhibits the transcription of androgen‐responsive genes and decreases sebum production and pro‐inflammatory cytokines from sebocytes; however, the mechanism of action of clascoterone cream 1% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris is unknown.  7  8 1  9  10  11  12 Figure 1 Chemical structures of (A) clascoterone, (B) cortexolone, (C) conjugated clascoterone, and (D) tetrahydrocortexolone. In phase 2 studies, topical treatment with clascoterone cream resulted in limited systemic absorption and a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients with acne; the most promising efficacy results were seen with twice‐daily application of clascoterone cream 1%.  13  14  15  16  17  18 In this manuscript, we present the results from 5 phase 1 trials evaluating the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and skin irritation and sensitization potential of clascoterone cream 1% in healthy participants and patients with acne vulgaris that provided the foundation for further clinical development of topical clascoterone. Methods Study Designs All studies were conducted in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Council for Harmonisation's Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and local regulatory and legal requirements, and were approved by local ethics committees before the initiation of any study activity. Study CB‐03‐01/02 (EudraCT number: 2007‐005064‐28) was performed at the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; the institutional review board (IRB) was Ethik‐Kommission der Medizinischen Universität Wien und des Allgemeinen Krankenhauses der Stadt Wien AKH, Austria. Studies CB‐03‐01/04 and CB‐03‐01/05 were performed at the Phase I Unit of CROSS Research S.A., Arzo, Switzerland; the IRB for both studies was Comitato Etico Cantonale, Canton Ticino, Switzerland. Study 171‐7151‐203 was performed at J&S Studies, Inc., College Station, TX; the IRB was Quorum Review IRB, Seattle, WA. Study CB‐03‐01/32 was performed at TKL Research, Inc., Fair Lawn, NJ; the IRB was IntegReview, Austin, TX. All participants provided written informed consent before participating. The designs of the 5 phase 1 studies of clascoterone are summarized in Table S1 In Study CB‐03‐01/05 (hereafter the skin irritation study), the skin irritation potential and safety of clascoterone cream 1% were assessed in comparison with a positive control (0.25% sodium lauryl sulfate) and a negative control (white petrolatum cream) applied to the same participants. The products were applied to the mid‐thoracic area of participants’ backs once daily on weekdays using Finn chamber adhesive strips (1 for clascoterone cream 1%, 1 for the positive control, and 2 for the negative control) for a total of 15 applications. The strips were applied under occlusion in the same designated site every day, secured using hypoallergenic adhesive tape, and left in situ for 23 ± 1 hours for strips applied on Monday through Thursday and 71 ± 1 hours for strips applied on Friday. Study CB‐03‐01/32 (hereafter the sensitization study) investigated the sensitization potential of clascoterone cream 1% in comparison with vehicle cream and a negative control (0.9% saline) using a repeated insult patch test design. This study consisted of an induction phase, a rest period, and a challenge phase. During the induction phase, 3 patches containing 1 of the 3 test products were applied to adjacent sites on the infrascapular area of each participant's back according to a prespecified randomization scheme. The patches were applied 3 times weekly for 3 weeks, with each participant undergoing 9 patch applications. There was a rest period of 10‐14 days after the induction phase. The challenge phase followed the rest period and consisted of one 48‐hour patch application to a naïve site on the opposite side of the back. If deemed necessary by the investigator, a rechallenge phase was added to confirm the sensitization potential of any test product that caused a clinically significant cutaneous response in the challenge phase. Participants For the SAD, MAD, skin irritation, and sensitization studies, eligible participants were healthy adults (nonsmoking in the SAD study), 18‐65 years of age, and, except for the sensitization study, with a body mass index 18 kg/m 2 2 2 Participants were excluded from the SAD, MAD, and skin irritation studies if they had clinically significant abnormalities identified by electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examination, or laboratory testing; clinically significant (SAD study) or relevant (MAD and skin irritation studies) disease, allergies, or hypersensitivity; abnormal skin pathologies that could interfere with study evaluation; medication use for 2 weeks before the study start; participation in investigative drug trials for 3 months (1 month for the SAD study) before the study start; a history of drug, alcohol, or tobacco abuse; or abnormal diets (<1600 or >3500 kcal/day; MAD and skin irritation studies). Exclusion criteria for the steady‐state PK study included pregnancy or lactation; use of tobacco or tobacco cessation products within 3 months of screening; use of a prescription drug or herbal product within 14 days, nonprescription drug or vitamin within 7 days, or any known enzyme inducers, inhibitors, or other investigational drugs within 30 days prior to dosing; use of topical anti‐acne medications containing retinoids within 4 weeks, systemic anti‐acne medications such as corticosteroids or antibiotics within 2 weeks, spironolactone within 4 weeks, or retinoid therapy within 3 months prior to baseline; clinically significant medical abnormalities, allergies, or hypersensitivity; and positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibody. Participants were excluded from the sensitization study if they had visible skin disease or damage at the application site; were not willing to refrain from strenuous exercise or from the use of analgesics and creams, cosmetics, ointments, or similar products; were using corticosteroids 3 weeks prior to and during the study or antihistamines for 72 hours prior to and during the study; had psoriasis or active atopic dermatitis/eczema; had a history of being treated for diabetes or skin cancer; or were pregnant or lactating. Pharmacokinetic Assessments In the PK studies, blood and urine samples for quantification of clascoterone, cortexolone, and tetrahydrocortexolone were collected at predetermined time points (Table S1 In the steady‐state PK study, plasma samples were processed by a liquid–liquid extraction procedure followed by derivatization. Urine samples were processed through a dehydration step by evaporation in isopropyl alcohol followed by derivatization with methoxylamine. The derivatives of the analytes were recovered by liquid–liquid extraction and evaporated and reconstituted for analysis. The plasma concentrations of clascoterone and cortexolone were determined using validated reversed‐phase high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) assays. HPLC was performed using a Zorbax SB‐CN column, and the mobile phase was nebulized using heated nitrogen in a Z‐spray source/interface set to positive ionization mode. Cortexolone‐d 7 7 In the steady‐state PK study, the concentrations of free and total (combined free and conjugated) clascoterone, cortexolone, and tetrahydrocortexolone in urine samples were also measured using validated LC‐MS/MS assays using the same solid and mobile phase parameters as for plasma analyses. Cortexolone‐d 7 5 5 7 5 7 In the SAD and MAD studies, plasma samples were acidified by adding 0.4 M HCl; urine samples were prepared by adding 0.1 M ammonium acetate. Afterward, the internal standard, 17α‐hydroxyprogesterone‐d 8 −2 8 In the SAD study, mean day‐to‐day precision was ≤3.72% for plasma clascoterone and ≤6.75% for plasma cortexolone. Mean between‐day accuracies varied between 0.20% and 2.15% for plasma clascoterone and −5.17% and −3.80% for plasma cortexolone. For free clascoterone, free cortexolone, and free tetrahydrocortexolone in urine, mean day‐to‐day precision was ≤7.16%, ≤8.75%, and ≤8.17%, respectively. Mean between‐day accuracies varied between 1.34% and 4.54% for free clascoterone, −1.42% and 2.26% for free cortexolone, and −2.00% and 0.78% for free tetrahydrocortexolone. For total clascoterone, total cortexolone, and total tetrahydrocortexolone in urine, mean day‐to‐day precision was ≤4.59%, ≤2.41%, and ≤4.19%, respectively. Mean between‐day accuracies varied between 0.37% and 4.07% for total clascoterone, −0.48% and 3.45% for total cortexolone, and 1.11% and 3.04% for total tetrahydrocortexolone. In the MAD study, mean day‐to‐day precision was ≤3.41% for plasma clascoterone and ≤5.27% for plasma cortexolone. Mean between‐day accuracies varied between −1.43% and 1.82% for plasma clascoterone and −2.32% and −0.90% for plasma cortexolone. For free clascoterone, free cortexolone, and free tetrahydrocortexolone in urine, mean day‐to‐day precision was ≤4.05%, ≤3.21%, and ≤4.38%, respectively. Mean between‐day accuracies varied between 1.25% and 4.64% for free clascoterone, −5.24% and −1.30% for free cortexolone, and −3.56% and 7.17% for free tetrahydrocortexolone. For total clascoterone, total cortexolone, and total tetrahydrocortexolone in urine, mean day‐to‐day precision was ≤3.46%, ≤5.16%, and ≤4.13%, respectively. Mean between‐day accuracies varied between 0.39% and 3.91% for total clascoterone, −1.11% and 3.04% for total cortexolone, and −1.52% and 6.03% for total tetrahydrocortexolone. The lower and upper limits of quantification (LLOQ and ULOQ) for clascoterone in plasma were 2.5 and 250 ng/mL, respectively, in the SAD and MAD studies, but 0.25 and 250 ng/mL, respectively, in the steady‐state PK study. For cortexolone, LLOQ and ULOQ in plasma were 2.5 and 250 ng/mL, respectively, in the SAD and MAD studies but 0.5 and 500 ng/mL, respectively, in the steady‐state PK study. In the SAD study, the LLOQ for both clascoterone and cortexolone in plasma was 2.5 ng/mL, but plasma concentrations falling between the LLOQ and the limits of detection (LOD) of 0.70 ng/mL for clascoterone and 0.74 ng/mL for cortexolone were also included in the analysis. In the MAD and steady‐state PK studies, only urinary concentrations of clascoterone, cortexolone, and tetrahydrocortexolone above the LLOQ (2.5 ng/mL in the MAD study and 0.5 ng/mL in the steady‐state PK study for all analytes) were reported. In the steady‐state PK study, concentrations of conjugated clascoterone, cortexolone, and tetrahydrocortexolone in urine were calculated as [total] – [free]. The analyzed plasma parameters included maximum observed plasma concentration (C max min avg max max min min Safety Assessments Safety assessments were performed at prespecified time points (Table S1 Skin Irritation and Sensitization Potential Assessments Application sites were assessed blindly by a trained evaluator for skin irritation. Dermal response at the application sites was evaluated 30 minutes after patch removal in both the skin irritation and sensitization studies, and at 30 minutes, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after patch removal in the challenge phase of the sensitization study using a scoring system that rated the degree of erythema, edema, papules, and other signs of cutaneous irritation. In detail, skin sensitization and irritation were assessed according to irritation scores, based on a scale of 0 to 7: 0, no evidence of irritation; (1) minimal erythema, barely perceptible; (2) definite erythema, readily visible or minimal edema or minimal papular response; (3) erythema and papules; (4) definite edema; (5) erythema, edema, and papules; (6) vesicular eruption; and (7) strong reaction spreading beyond the test site. In addition, the effects of the treatments on superficial layers of the skin were assessed using a scale of 0 to 3 and symbols: A, 0–slight glazed appearance; B, 1–marked glazing; C, 2–glazing with peeling and cracking; F, 3–glazing with fissures; G, 3–film of dried serous exudate covering all or a portion of the patch; and H, 3–small petechial erosions and/or scabs. In the skin irritation study, subjective symptoms of itching, burning, pain, and soreness were assessed blindly by the participants and scored using a scale of 0 to 3: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. Burning and itching were also recorded in the sensitization study if they prevented the assignment of a sensitization score or indicated damage to the epidermis or spreading of the reaction beyond the patch site. For both the skin irritation and sensitization studies, the mean cumulative irritation score (MCIS) and total cumulative irritation score (TCIS) were assessed. The TCIS was calculated for each participant and treatment as the sum of individual dermal response scores. For the skin irritation study only, the time (in days) to reach an irritation reaction of Grade 1, 2, and 3 for the first time was also assessed. Sensitization potential was evaluated at the application sites at 30 minutes, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after patch removal in the challenge phase of the sensitization study using the same scoring system described above. Statistical Analysis For all studies, the sample sizes were not based on statistical calculations but were estimated to be sufficient to achieve the respective study objectives. In the SAD, MAD, and steady‐state PK studies, all participants who completed the study without any significant protocol deviations were included in the PK analysis set. In all studies, all participants who received at least 1 application of study treatment were included in the safety analysis set. In the skin irritation study, all randomized participants who received all applications of the test drugs (n = 15 sites for clascoterone cream 1% and positive control, and n = 30 sites for negative control) and had all dermal responses collected or who demonstrated irritation and therefore did not complete applications were included in the analysis of cumulative irritation. In the sensitization study, all randomized participants who completed the induction phase of the study and those who had patch sites discontinued due to irritation were included in the cumulative irritation analysis set. All randomized patients who completed the induction and challenge phases of the study were included in the sensitization analysis set. Frequencies and/or descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic characteristics, PK, safety, skin irritation, and sensitization parameters. The PK parameters were calculated for each participant and summarized using noncompartmental analysis. Concentrations reported as BQL were imputed as 0 for the PK analysis and in the steady‐state PK study as 0 for analysis of observed data and ranks and as one‐half of the LLOQ for the log‐transformed data analysis. In the steady‐state PK study, the C max max min min τ avg τ  19 Missing data were not imputed in the SAD, MAD, steady‐state PK, and skin irritation studies except as previously noted. For participants in the skin irritation study who demonstrated irritation and for whom the applications were discontinued, the value of the last available dermal response score was carried forward for subsequent missing scores. In the sensitization study, no data imputation was made for participants who had fewer than 9 evaluations during the induction phase except for those participants who discontinued due to limiting irritation with the last observation carried forward. Statistical analyses, including Helmert contrasts, were performed using SAS for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) version 9.1.3 in the SAD, MAD, and skin irritation studies; version 9.2 in the sensitization study; and version 9.3 in the steady‐state PK study. PK calculations were performed using Kinetica version 4.4.1 (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) in the SAD study, WinNonLin Phoenix (Pharsight Corporation, USA) version 5.2 in the MAD study, and WinNonLin Phoenix version 6.3 and Microsoft Excel 2010 in the steady‐state PK study. Results Participants The demographic characteristics of participants in the phase 1 studies are summarized in Table S2 S3 Pharmacokinetics In the SAD study (n = 24), clascoterone was detectable in the plasma of 1/6 and 2/6 participants treated with 1 and 2 mL, respectively, at concentrations ranging from 0.75 to 30.39 ng/mL. In the 4‐mL treatment group, 5/6 participants had detectable levels of clascoterone at 10, 12, and 16 hours postdose, ranging from 0.70 to 7.96 ng/mL (Table S4 S5 S6 In the SAD study, free unchanged clascoterone, cortexolone, and tetrahydrocortexolone were not detectable in urine, except for 1 participant receiving the 4‐mL dose who had a urinary clascoterone concentration of 3.57 ng/mL within 6 hours post‐application. In contrast, total (combined free and conjugated) clascoterone was detectable in 15/18 participants from 6 hours after application; because no free clascoterone was detected, this total represents conjugated clascoterone. Following a single 8‐hour topical application of clascoterone cream 1%, the excretion of sulfate or glucuronide‐conjugated clascoterone accounted for approximately 0.1%‐0.5% of applied clascoterone, independently of the dose. Total (combined free and conjugated) cortexolone and tetrahydrocortexolone were quantifiable in all urine samples. Excretion of conjugated cortexolone and tetrahydrocortexolone were similar regardless of clascoterone dose (Table 1 Table 1 Mean Cumulative Excretion (0‐36 hours) and Excretion Rate of Clascoterone, Cortexolone, and Tetrahydrocortexolone After the Application of 1 mL (10 mg), 2 mL (20 mg), and 4 mL (40 mg) of Clascoterone Cream for 8 hours in the SAD Study Clascoterone dose Parameter  1 mL (10 mg) (n = 6)  2 mL (20 mg) (n = 6)  4 mL (40 mg) (n = 6) Clascoterone ΣXu (µg) 46.08 ± 21.24 78.06 ± 40.84 56.19 ± 41.09 dXu/Δt (µg/h) 1.28 ± 0.59 2.17 ± 1.13 1.56 ± 1.14 Excreted fraction of the applied dose (%) 0.46 ± 0.21 0.39 ± 0.20 0.14 ± 0.10 Cortexolone ΣXu (µg) 104.11 ± 27.40 112.82 ± 19.17 114.37 ± 38.19 dXu/Δt (µg/h) 2.89 ± 0.76 3.13 ± 0.53 3.18 ± 1.06 Tetrahydrocortexolone ΣXu (µg) 135.10 ± 43.44 132.76 ± 33.91 133.17 ± 66.15 dXu/Δt (µg/h) 3.75 ± 1.21 3.69 ± 0.94 3.70 ± 1.84 dXu/Δt, mean excretion rate; ΣXu, mean cumulative excretion; SAD, single‐ascending dose; SD, standard deviation. Data shown as arithmetic mean ± SD. Except for 1 patient with a detectable free unchanged clascoterone concentration, no free clascoterone, free cortexolone, or free tetrahydrocortexolone were detected in any urine sample. Therefore, the total excretion fraction effectively represents the conjugated forms. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Following the application of multiple doses, <1% of the applied clascoterone dose was excreted into urine as total clascoterone. Increasing the dose from 4 to 8 mL did not increase the cumulative excretion. Multiple applications of either dose of clascoterone cream did not increase the cumulative excretion or excretion rate of cortexolone; however, the cumulative excretion of tetrahydrocortexolone increased 1.5‐ to 1.8‐fold over baseline after the 14th application. The excretion rate did not vary with multiple applications of clascoterone (Table 2 Table 2 Mean Cumulative Excretion (0‐24 hours) and Partial Excretion Rate of Clascoterone, Cortexolone, and Tetrahydrocortexolone After the 1st, 10th, and 14th Applications of 4 and 8 mL of Clascoterone for 4 hours in the MAD Study 4‐mL dose applications 8‐mL dose applications Parameter  1st (n = 12)  10th (n = 12)  14th (n = 12)  1st (n = 12)  10th (n = 12)  14th (n = 12) Clascoterone ΣXu (µg) 122.7 ± 83.6 248.3 ± 97.6 370.4 ± 113.1 56.4 ± 37.5 134.4 ± 59.1 250.2 ± 81.4 dXu/Δ 0‐4 0.23 ± 0.27 3.80 ± 1.81 8.24 ± 5.75 0.08 ± 0.18 3.18 ± 0.81 4.61 ± 1.81 dXu/Δ 4‐12 15.2 ± 10.4 29.1 ± 12.2 32.4 ± 13.6 7.01 ± 4.71 15.2 ± 7.29 19.3 ± 10.3 dXu/Δ 12‐24 NA NA 6.53 ± 2.55 NA NA 6.47 ± 2.72 Cortexolone ΣXu (µg) 39.9 ± 13.0 30.7 ± 6.51 45.7 ± 12.0 39.2 ± 10.7 37.0 ± 11.7 57.3 ± 13.4 dXu/Δ 0‐4 3.93 ± 1.37 3.01 ± 0.90 3.72 ± 0.98 3.71 ± 1.95 4.39 ± 1.68 4.81 ± 1.25 dXu/Δ 4‐12 3.02 ± 0.95 2.34 ± 0.57 2.56 ± 1.04 3.04 ± 0.62 2.43 ± 0.85 2.77 ± 1.33 dXu/Δ 12‐24 NA NA 0.86 ± 0.24 NA NA 1.32 ± 0.36 Tetrahydro‐cortexolone ΣXu (µg) 60.8 ± 19.3 74.2 ± 19.0 121.6 ± 30.4 45.2 ± 15.5 56.9 ± 21.3 102.6 ± 28.6 dXu/Δ 0‐4 5.05 ± 1.92 5.61 ± 2.71 6.53 ± 1.53 3.49 ± 1.75 5.65 ± 2.45 5.66 ± 1.91 dXu/Δ 4‐12 5.08 ± 1.63 6.47 ± 1.34 7.21 ± 2.35 3.90 ± 1.44 4.29 ± 1.67 5.07 ± 2.15 dXu/Δ 12‐24 NA NA 3.15 ± 1.33 NA NA 3.28 ± 0.92 ΣXu, mean cumulative excretion; dXu/Δ 0‐4 4‐12 12‐24 Data shown as arithmetic mean ± SD.

The frequencies of AEs and LSRs were low, and all reactions were mild or moderate and reversible. No treatment‐related serious AEs were observed. Laboratory abnormalities were limited, and none were considered clinically relevant. There were also no clinically relevant changes in vital signs or ECGs. Clascoterone cream 1% demonstrated significantly lower irritation potential compared with the positive control and was classified as a mild product without evidence of cumulative irritation. No signs of sensitization were observed after patch removal in participants challenged with clascoterone cream 1%. Overall, the results of the 5 phase 1 studies demonstrated that the topical application of clascoterone cream 1% results in minimal systemic exposure, with a safety profile similar to the vehicle and no local irritation or skin sensitization. These results supported advancement of clascoterone cream 1% to phase 2 and phase 3 trials, wherein twice‐daily treatment with clascoterone cream 1% demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of acne vulgaris with limited systemic exposure and a favorable safety profile.  13  15 Conclusions In phase 1 studies in healthy participants and patients with acne vulgaris, the PK and safety profiles of clascoterone cream 1% were favorable, with low systemic absorption and no evidence of irritation or sensitization.
