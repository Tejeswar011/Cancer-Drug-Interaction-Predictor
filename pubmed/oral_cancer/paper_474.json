Brown tumor is usually caused by primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism but is exceptionally rare after kidney transplantation. Their rarity and atypical pathological features make diagnosis and treatment particularly challenging. We present a case of a 38-year-old woman with multiple brown tumors secondary to persistent hyperparathyroidism following kidney transplantation. The patient was initially admitted to the orthopedic department for left shoulder dislocation and lytic lesions in the left humerus and was diagnosed with a giant cell tumor of bone. Further investigations revealed elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and multiple lytic bone lesions throughout the skeleton. Based on these findings, the patient was ultimately diagnosed with multiple brown tumors. As a result, the patient underwent total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue. Follow-up evaluations showed decreased PTH levels and alkaline phosphatase levels, with improvement in skeletal changes. This case report shares the experience and lessons in managing hyperparathyroidism, both before and after kidney transplantation, emphasizing the importance of clinicians’ awareness of the disease and multidisciplinary collaborative management. brown tumors kidney transplantation secondary hyperparathyroidism parathyroid hormone case report The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

She presented with persistent left upper arm pain for 2 months, limiting mobility, and was admitted to the orthopedics department in July 2024. She had undergone KT in March 2022 after 4 years of hemodialysis. During hemodialysis, her intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels ranged from 1253 to 1595 pg/ml. She had been treated with paricalcitol and cinacalcet but discontinued these medications due to hypercalcemia and severe gastrointestinal reactions. The patient had concurrent hyperphosphatemia and was non-compliant with medical advice due to anticipation of spontaneous resolution of SHPT post-kidney transplantation. However, iPTH levels remained at approximately 2000 pg/ml post-transplant. The patient was subsequently maintained on long-term oral calcitriol at a dose of 0.25 µg daily. Physical examination revealed that her blood pressure was 134/84 mmHg. The patient had an anemic appearance. The left forearm was sling, limiting movement of the left shoulder joint. There was significant local tenderness, with no other positive physical signs. Laboratory tests revealed that the hemoglobin level was 69 g/L and that the creatinine level was 237μmol/L. Left humeral X-ray Examination showed an osteolytic lesion in the middle–upper segment of the left humerus, suggesting neoplastic changes, along with a pathological fracture and dislocation of the left shoulder joint (  Figure 1A  Figure 1B  Figure 1K  Figure 1C  Figures 1D, E  Figures 1F, G  Figure 1H  Figures 1I, J  Figure 1L  Table 1  Figure 2A  Figure 2B Figure 1  (A) (B) (C) (D, E) (F, G) (H) (I, J) (K) (L) A series of medical images labeled A to L includes various diagnostic scans and histology slides.

The current literature indicates that kidney transplant recipients typically have extended life expectancies, enhanced quality of life, and decreased societal costs compared with those on the waiting list ( 3 5 6 7 8 (THPT).A prospective study by Whitney Sutton et al. found that the incidence of SHPT was 61.7%, while that of THPT was 21.5% in kidney transplant recipients ( 9 10 11 12 13 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 11 39 40 41 42 43 44 44 4 Conclusion Brown tumor is extremely rare after kidney transplantation and often lead to misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis due to their atypical symptoms. It can cause fractures and subsequent disabilities, significantly affecting patient outcomes. This underscores the diagnostic challenges faced by clinicians. Future efforts should focus on developing precise diagnostic and treatment protocols to improve the prognosis for patients with brown tumor.
