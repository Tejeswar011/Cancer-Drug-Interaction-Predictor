These injuries commonly arise in the setting of pelvic radiation and are generally preceded by instrumentation of the lower urinary tract for obstruction. USFs tend to be recognized only after patients fail to recover from multiple lower urinary tract infections, resulting in repeat hospital readmissions. While fistula closures with urinary tract reconstruction have been described, treatment of USF is often complex and is best treated via urinary diversion with pubic bone debridement in the setting of preoperative optimization and long-term postoperative antibiotic regimens. The general understanding of USF presentation, work-up, and management is largely based on retrospective reviews with small sample sizes and case reports. Here we review the etiology, diagnosis, and considerations when providing care for this complex condition and propose a management algorithm to guide care. Recent Findings Recent data on USF remain limited, with the literature dominated by small, retrospective case series and single-institution reviews. Most published studies report on cohorts of fewer than 30 patients, often focusing on men with a history of pelvic radiotherapy and subsequent urethral manipulation for prostate cancer. There is a notable absence of formal guidance from professional societies regarding standardized preoperative evaluation, diagnostic criteria, antimicrobial regimens, surgical techniques, or follow-up protocols for this condition. The literature published in the past 18 months continues to be sparse, with fewer than 10 new publications identified, underscoring the rarity of the condition and the ongoing need for multicenter studies and consensus guidelines. Summary The presentation of USF can be quite subtle initially, and thus its diagnosis is nuanced and requires providers maintain a low threshold for further evaluation in high-risk patients with pelvic pain and refractory urinary tract infections. Here, we propose a comprehensive management pathway, informed by the current data, data from relevant related disease processes and institutional experience, that begins with contrast-enhanced imaging, preoperative medical optimization, and early involvement of infectious disease and surgical subspecialists to support perioperative and intraoperative planning and management. Ultimately, long durations of culture-directed antibiotics as well as surgical debridement with cystectomy, pubectomy, and urinary diversion is the most definitive method for cure of this condition. Long-term, high-volume studies on management and outcomes in these patients have yet to be performed.

This condition most often arises following radiotherapy and urologic endoscopic interventions for lower urinary tract obstruction, presenting with debilitating pelvic pain, difficulty with ambulation, and recalcitrant urinary tract infections [ 1 2 Etiology USF is a rare but serious complication more often occurring in patients treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy in combination with surgical interventions such as radical prostatectomy or endoscopic procedures [ 3 1 4 4 6 1 4 1 5 While USF is most often described in men with a history of prostate radiotherapy and urethral manipulation, it has been rarely described in women as well, with one case series describing four women with USF, only two of which had a history of any pelvic radiotherapy. Those who did not have prior radiation did have a history of neurogenic bladder managed with chronic indwelling foley [ 7 The infectious etiology of POM associated with USF is well-documented, however reported pathogens vary. A single, isolated organism may be the causative pathogen in POM; however, polymicrobial infections are also commonly seen [ 6 4 8 4 9 Diagnosis Clinical Presentation Patients typically present with a constellation of symptoms that significantly impact their quality of life. The most common presenting symptoms include debilitating pelvic pain, which is often exacerbated by ambulation, and difficulty walking. This pain is frequently described as severe and persistent, leading to a waddling gait or immobility [ 3 10 1 2 11 2 5 12 4 1 9 Fig. 1 Urethrocutaneous fistula in patient undergoing surgical intervention for pubic osteomyelitis and urosymphyseal fistula at our institution Diagnostic Workup As most patients will present acutely due to pain or infectious symptoms to an ED or urgent care, they typically will have up-to-date labs when the urologist is engaged. Given the infectious nature of the condition, leukocytosis is common, but not universal. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are often elevated in patients with USF and POM, but these laboratory values are inconsistent and nonspecific in this setting [ 13 3 8 8 10 Cross-sectional imaging is essential in accurately diagnosing USF. Plain radiographs are generally insufficiently sensitive to detect osteomyelitis; however, they may be useful for excluding alternative diagnoses such as fracture, dislocation, or malignancy [ 14 15 15 16 15 17 Ultimately, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast remains the most sensitive modality for identifying early stages of osteomyelitis and is the gold standard imaging modality for evaluating osteomyelitis of any location [ 18 19 2 3 4 19 20 4 Fig. 2 Pelvic MRI demonstrating fistulous tract between urethra and pubic symphysis Fig. 3 Sagittal view of pelvic MRI demonstrating fistulous tract between urethra and pubic symphysis Fig. 4 CT Urogram with air adjacent to bladder at the level of the pubic symphysis- an indicator of potential infection and fistula While imaging alone can diagnosing USF, a presumptive diagnosis of POM can often be made based on clinical presentation, including symptoms, risk factors, and supportive imaging findings, particularly when accompanied by positive urine or wound cultures. Medical and surgical management may be initiated based on high enough suspicion from these findings, despite, definitive diagnosis of POM requiring surgically obtained tissue culture from the pubic symphysis. The highest yield for accurate specimen collection typically occurs at the time of surgical debridement. Given the source of POM in USF fistula is the connection between the genitourinary tract and the bone, bone biopsy and culture are often collected at the time of fistula takedown. Nevertheless, the role of biopsy remains controversial, with some series reporting culture positivity rates as low as 35% in confirmed cases of POM [ 21 Management Medical Management Medical management for USF starts at the time of presentation and includes patient optimization prior to surgery, during hospitalization, and postoperatively with antimicrobials. Given the need for long-term intravenous antibiotics in most cases, consultation with infectious disease specialists at the time of initial diagnosis of POM in the setting of USF is crucial for optimal management of long-term antibiotic therapy. These patients will often require multiple admissions for infectious sequelae prior to definitive surgery, and thus the complexity and severity of these infections almost always require the expert guidance of an infectious disease physician regarding the selection and duration of antimicrobial therapy, ensuring that treatment is both effective and tailored to the specific pathogens involved [ 22 While targeted antibiotic therapy is the ideal of medical management in POM secondary to USF, bacterial and fungal growth from superficial cultures or cultures from the urinary tract do not correlate strongly enough with the final pathologic specimens to drive antimicrobial selection without an expert [ 23 Without a culture from the site of osteomyelitis, antibiotic guidance is limited. Retrospective studies recommend broad-spectrum coverage targeting staphylococcal species, gram-negative bacilli, as well as fungal and anaerobic organisms [ 8 24 25 25 3 8 Following definitive bone debridement for POM and urinary diversion for USF, the timing of antibiotic therapy is controversial. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends a minimum of 6 weeks of intravenous, broad-spectrum antibiotics for chronic osteomyelitis, with duration extended up to one year based on clinical response, imaging, and culture results [ 25 26 27 27 29 30 Aside from disease treatment, pain management should be an additional focus. Guidance is minimal in this regard, however multiple publications detail the risk for the development of opioid-dependence in those suffering from USF long-term, suggesting the need for alternate and multimodal pain management strategies and potential for involvement of palliative care or chronic pain teams [ 4 31 Pre-Surgical Management In patients with a history of radiotherapy for prostate cancer, non-surgical treatments for USF are rarely successful, necessitating more definitive surgical interventions. In a retrospective review of patients with pelvic pain and associated USF following prostate radiation, 15 of 16 patients required eventual surgical intervention to manage symptoms [ 2 Preoperative counseling is critical in optimizing patients with USF with POM and includes discussion of the risks of dehydration, digestive changes, wound healing complications- including wound dehiscence and infection- significant bleeding, and rarely more devastating cardiac and neurologic complications or mortality. Data from a cohort of 389 patients who underwent simple cystectomy for benign disease demonstrated a 30-day postoperative complication rate of 60.4%. The most common complications included bleeding requiring transfusion within 72 h (38.6%), wound infection (16.2%), respiratory complications (7.5%), renal complications (2.3%), wound dehiscence (2.1%), postoperative deep vein thrombosis (2.1%), and cardiovascular complications (1.5%) [ 32 At our institution, patients receive nutritional counseling and are recommended to supplement their protein intake [ 33 34 35 36 38 33 39 43 44 44 45 Additionally, all patients are seen by specialized wound ostomy nurses for perioperative wound care and stoma marking to help patients and caregivers become comfortable with postoperative stoma management in concordance with American Urological Association and Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society position statement which is largely based on data from colorectal surgery patients [ 46 47 48 51 We advocate for early mobilization to avoid deconditioning and promote early recovery after surgery consistent with most enhanced recovery after surgery guidelines including those for patients undergoing radical cystectomy [ 52 54 55 Surgical Management The surgical management of USF with POM often necessitates a multidisciplinary approach which may involve orthopedic surgeons, colorectal surgeons and plastic surgeons in addition to urologic surgeons [ 11 9 56 11 Historically, an open abdominal approach has been the standard for extensive debridement, fistula excision, and pubic symphyseal resection (Fig. 5 5 9 Fig. 5 Surgical intervention of urosymphyseal fistula with pubic bone debridement Orthopedic surgery may be engaged to assist with this resection. Urologic reconstructive surgeons may be comfortable performing this themselves, especially those with experience performing pubectomy during posterior urethroplasty, however it is important to consider that resection in the setting of POM may be significantly more extensive. As the pelvis is a fixed ring, resection of the pubic symphysis anteriorly should not have significant impact on stability or gait, however in patients with prior pelvic ring injuries, consideration of posterior fixation prior to anterior resection of the pubis may be considered. Urinary diversion using either ileum or colon conduits then proceeds in the standard fashion. One study investigated the role of near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIFI) combined with indocyanine green (ICG) in assessing ureteral tissue perfusion during open urinary diversion and showed that NIFI/ICG changed intraoperative decision-making in 63% of cases, particularly in patients with prior radiation [ 57 57 Vascularized flap coverage of the pubectomy site and obliteration of pelvic dead space is another essential portion of the procedure. The peritoneum can be carefully dissected away from the dome of the bladder for later use as a pelvic flap. Omental flaps are frequently mobilized on a right gastroepiploic pedicle to obliterate dead space, protect anastomotic sites, and cover exposed bony surfaces [ 2 6 1 Fig. 6 Peritoneal flap to cover pelvic defect following pubic bone debridement in osteomyelitis associated with urosymphyseal fistula Advancements in robotic-assisted surgery have paralleled trends in radical cystectomy for bladder cancer, offering reduced blood loss and shorter hospital stays [ 58 59 59 60 61 64 65 66 Postoperatively, prolonged antibiotic therapy remains critical, with a single-stage surgical success rate exceeding 80% in some series, underscoring the efficacy of aggressive but well-coordinated surgical management in these cases [ 67 Treatment Failure Treatment failure is a complex clinical challenge and unfortunately not uncommon. Literature on medical-only management limited in patients with USF. Additionally, the initial data suggesting that medical-only management might be protective against failure in patients with non-USF POM must be interpreted with caution, as patients opting for medical-only management often have fewer risk factors for recurrence, such as fewer comorbidities, improved frailty scores, and less incidence of prior pelvic surgery [ 6 13 6 12 68 Ultimately, a multidisciplinary approach combining medical optimization with intravenous antibiotics and surgical intervention — such as cystectomy with debridement or excision of the infected pubic symphysis — is believed to offer patients with these complex infections the best chance for successful treatment and reduced risk of recurrence. However, the risks associated with significant surgery must be carefully weighed, and patient selection is critical. Factors such as the patient’s overall health, the extent of infection, and previous treatments should be considered. Surgical debridement combined with pathogen-specific antibiotic therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for infected pubic symphysitis with a USF [ 69 Should a recurrence of POM occur following medical and surgical intervention for USF, interventions include prolonged courses of broad antibiotics including coverage for prior cultures and the potential need for additional surgical debridement. The use of antibiotic-impregnated resorbable biocomposites to fill resected space has been described in orthopedic journals for management of joint infections, although widespread use in the setting of POM with USF is not thoroughly described [ 70 Future Directions While USF with POM remains a rare and debilitating condition, advancements in both diagnostic and surgical techniques are essential to improving patient outcomes. Delayed diagnosis continues to be a major challenge, with a median time of five months from symptom onset to definitive surgery [ 11 56 11 71 Looking ahead, the evolution of surgical management will likely emphasize minimally invasive techniques to reduce perioperative morbidity while maintaining functional efficacy. Emerging approaches, such as robotic-assisted cystectomy and urinary diversion and Holmium: YAG laser-assisted debridement, offer promising avenues for reducing blood loss, enhancing precision, and expediting recovery. Further research into tissue engineering and bioengineered grafts may also play a role in reconstructive strategies following pubic symphyseal resection [ 72 Conclusion USF with POM is a rare and complex medical condition. Patient populations are often comorbid and have had prior pelvic radiotherapy in addition to urethral manipulation, making surgical interventions and wound healing more challenging. Diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and contrasted imaging studies, however definitive diagnosis should include cystourethroscopy, fluoroscopy, MRI, and ultimately pubic bone biopsy and culture. Management hinges on a multidisciplinary focus approach and includes recruitment of infectious disease specialists as well as various surgical subspecialists on a case-dependent bases. Medical optimization and counseling prior to extensive surgical intervention followed by long-term antibiotic regimens and infectious disease follow-up is critical to best positioning patients for success. Treatment failure with a purely nonsurgical approach is described and decision making for care requires careful consideration of patient symptoms and clinical status, comorbidities, prior pelvic interventions, and patient support systems. At our institution we approach USF and POM in a multidisciplinary fashion, which starts preoperatively and continues for years postoperatively (Fig. 7  Fig. 7 Proposed algorithm for management of urosymphyseal fistula Key References  L.

This study provides one of the most detailed institutional series on USF and pubic osteomyelitis in prostate cancer survivors, clarifying the strong association between prior pelvic radiotherapy, urethral manipulations, and the subsequent development of these complications, which often present years after initial cancer treatment. The findings reinforce that conservative management is rarely successful in irradiated patients, and that most require multidisciplinary surgical intervention and directly addresses gaps in the literature regarding optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

This study represents one of the largest single-institution experiences with USF from 2009 to 2021, systematically characterizing clinical presentation, diagnostic delays, and the high prevalence of pelvic osteomyelitis in this population. The findings demonstrate that definitive surgical management—typically involving cystectomy, pubic bone debridement or resection, and soft-tissue flap reconstruction—results in significant reductions in pain scores and chronic opioid use, highlighting the importance of aggressive intervention for symptom control and quality of life.

By evaluating imaging progression and patient-reported outcomes, this study underscores the importance of integrating early radiological assessment and multidisciplinary care into post-radiation follow-up protocols, thereby informing future strategies for earlier detection, improved perioperative planning, and tailored management of USF and PO in high-risk populations.
