This study investigated whether AMT and CLZ impair mitochondrial bioenergetics, a key mechanism linked to hepatotoxicity. Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver and incubated with AMT or CLZ (50–200 µM) to assess respiration, membrane potential (Δψ), ATP production, and the activities of respiratory chain complexes and ATP synthase. Both herbicides significantly inhibited state 3 (ADP-stimulated) respiration with glutamate plus malate, without altering state 4 (basal) respiration. Concentrations above 100 µM reduced Δψ and ATP synthesis in glutamate plus malate or succinate-energized mitochondria. Enzymatic assays revealed inhibition of complex I by both herbicides, complex II by CLZ, and ATP synthase by both. These results highlight mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disruption by AMT and CLZ; however, further in situ and in vivo studies are necessary to fully understand their hepatotoxic potential. pesticides toxicology liver mitochondrial dysfunction adenosine triphosphate São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) 2022/05645-9 This study was financed, in part, by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Brasil.

Introduction Ametryn (AMT) is an s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 9 10 10 11 8 12 13 Clomazone (CLZ) is a herbicide belonging to the class of isoxazolidinones and is widely used against weeds in a variety of crops, such as soybean, peanut, rice, and sugarcane. CLZ works by inhibiting weed growth through disruption of carotenoid biosynthesis, which is essential for plant growth and development [ 14 15 3 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 The liver is one of the organs most affected by exposure to AMT. Studies have shown that AMT can induce significant hepatic damage in different biological models. For instance, in isolated hepatocytes and primary cultured hepatocytes, exposure to the herbicide was found to increase the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a marker of cytotoxicity [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 Because it lies between the gastrointestinal tract and the systemic circulation, the liver serves as a major hub for metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification, making it one of the primary target organs for chemical exposure [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 Mitochondria generate the majority of cellular ATP necessary for homeostasis, and evidence indicates that they represent a primary and vulnerable target for the effects of drugs, toxins, and reactive metabolites produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes, often leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity [ 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 Rhamdia quelen S 49 Mitochondrial energetic function is commonly evaluated through measurements of oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, and mitochondrial membrane potential; however, the activities of specific enzymes can also provide valuable insights into the integrity of the ETC [ 50 51 52 53 2 51 54 Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with AMT and CLZ cytotoxicity [ 30 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemicals AMT (Catalog Number: 45321; purity = 100%) and CLZ (Catalog Number: 46120; purity = 100%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All other reagents were commercial products of standard chemical grade. Ultrapure water (Direct Q3, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used. All other reagents were commercially available of standard chemical grade. Ultrapure water (Direct Q3, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) was used to prepare the solutions. AMT and CLZ were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the final concentration of DMSO in the assay medium did not exceed 0.1% ( v v 2.2. Animals Male Wistar rats with an average body weight of approximately 200 g were used in this study. The rats were housed under standard laboratory conditions (temperature, 23 ± 3 °C; humidity, 55 ± 15%; light/dark cycle, 12 h:12 h), with a maximum of four per cage, and had ad libitum access to water and food. Animals were supplied by the Central Animal Facility of São Paulo State University (Unesp), Campus of Botucatu, SP, Brazil. All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee for the Use of Laboratory Animals of the São Paulo State University (Unesp), Campus of Dracena, SP, Brazil (Approval numbers 13/2018.SP and 16/2022.R1). 2.3. Experimental Design In all experiments, the herbicides were used individually (i.e., not in combination). The exact incubation duration and temperature varied depending on the specific assay performed and are detailed in the corresponding Section 2 2.4. Isolation and Disruption of Rat Liver Mitochondria Mitochondria were isolated by conventional differential centrifugation [ 63 g g g 64 A heat shock treatment, with three successive cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in a water bath heated to 37 °C, was used to obtain disrupted mitochondria. Following this process, the protein concentration was measured to account for any potential protein loss resulting from freeze–thaw cycles. Membrane fragments were maintained at 4 °C and utilized for mitochondrial enzyme activity assays within 3 h. 2.5. Mitochondrial Respiration Assay Mitochondrial respiration was assessed using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Strathkelvin Instruments Limited, Glasgow, Scotland, UK), with respiratory parameters measured following the methods of Chance and Williams (1956) [ 65 2 4 State 3 respiration (ADP-stimulated) was induced by the addition of ADP (400 nmol) in the presence of the substrates, and the subsequent maximal ADP-coupled oxygen consumption rate was recorded. State 4 (resting) respiration was determined after complete phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (return to basal rate). Only mitochondrial preparations with Respiratory Control Ratio (RCR = state 3/state 4) higher than 4.0 were used in the experiments. 2.6. Estimation of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential ( Δψ The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) was assessed spectrofluorometrically with an RF-5301 PC fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), using excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 and 586 nm, respectively. Safranin O (10 µM) was employed as the fluorescent probe [ 66 2.7. ATP Quantification ATP levels in mitochondria were quantified using the firefly luciferin-luciferase assay system [ 67 2 4 g 4 g g −10 −7 2.8. Determination of Enzymatic Activities Mitochondrial oxidase activities were determined according to Bracht et al. (2003) [ 68 c The activity of NADH and succinate dehydrogenase was measured spectrophotometrically according to Singer (1974) [ 52 2 4 2 4 −1 −1 −1 −1 Mitochondrial ATPase activity was determined in both intact-uncoupled and freeze–thaw-disrupted mitochondria following the method of Bracht et al. (2003) [ 68 69 −1 −1 2.9. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as mean ± the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism v 9.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), applying one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered statistically significant at p 3. Results 3.1. Effects of AMT and CLZ on Mitochondrial Respiration Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of AMT and CLZ (50–200 µM). The parameters evaluated included state 3 respiration (oxygen consumption in the presence of respiratory substrate and ADP) and state 4 respiration (oxygen consumption following ADP depletion). At concentrations of 150 and 200 µM, AMT reduced state 3 respiration in mitochondria energized with glutamate and malate (complex I electron donors) ( Figure 1 Figure 1 The herbicide CLZ significantly inhibited state 3 respiration starting at a concentration of 100 µM in mitochondria energized with glutamate plus malate ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 2 The data shown in Table 1 3.2. Effect of AMT and CLZ on Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψ) Figure 3 In mitochondria energized with succinate, AMT significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential at concentrations of 150 and 200 µM, while CLZ showed an effect only at a concentration of 200 µM ( Figure 3 3.3. Effect of AMT and CLZ on Mitochondrial ATP Levels The effects of the tested herbicides on ATP concentration in mitochondria energized with glutamate plus malate are shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 3.4. Influence of AMT and CLZ on Mitochondrial Enzymatic Activities NADH-mediated respiration (NADH oxidase activity) was not affected by AMT at any concentration tested ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Regarding the effect of herbicides on the activity of NADH dehydrogenase, an enzyme of complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, an inhibitory effect was observed at all tested concentrations of AMT or CLZ ( Figure 6 The herbicide AMT did not cause significant changes in the activity of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, while CLZ presented an inhibitory effect at all tested concentrations ( Figure 6 3.5. Effects of AMT and CLZ on F o 1 The effects of AMT and CLZ on F o 1 Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 The overall effects of AMT and CLZ on parameters related to mitochondrial bioenergetics are presented in Figure 8 4. Discussion AMT and CLZ exposure have been associated with hepatotoxic effects in both aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. Chronic oral exposure to sub-lethal doses of AMT in Wistar rats resulted in genotoxic effects, oxidative stress, hepatic fibrosis, and downregulation of gap junction proteins, indicating hepatocellular injury and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [ 46 ® 70 Danio rerio 71 71 Several literature reports have linked mitochondrial dysfunction to the toxic effects of pesticides observed in the liver [ 72 73 74 75 76 77 s In glutamate-plus-malate-supported respiration, the RCR, a parameter of mitochondrial function indicating the degree of coupling between the oxidation of respiratory substrates and ATP production [ 65 Table 1 AMT and CLZ decreased the membrane potential in mitochondria energized with glutamate plus malate from a concentration of 100 μM and succinate from 150 μM. Additionally, the ATP synthesis was significantly inhibited from 150 μM of AMT and 100 μM of CLZ in mitochondria energized with glutamate plus malate and at 200 μM of AMT and concentrations from 150 μM of CLZ in mitochondria energized with succinate. The lack of significant changes in state 3 and 4 respiration during complex II-linked respiration despite the observed decrease in membrane potential and ATP synthesis may reflect a mild uncoupling effect, where proton conductance is slightly increased. Such partial uncoupling can reduce the proton motive force and impair ATP synthesis without producing detectable changes in oxygen consumption rates [ 78 79 To elucidate the inhibitory effects of AMT and CLZ on NADH, succinate and cytochrome c oxidases assays were carried out using disrupted mitochondria. This approach allows assessment of electron transport through the respiratory chain independently of the intact membrane, phosphorylation activity, or other processes dependent on membrane potential, enabling identification of the specific site of respiratory chain inhibition. NADH oxidase activity was not significantly affected by AMT, whereas CLZ consistently inhibited this activity at all tested concentrations. Similarly, succinate oxidase activity was unaffected by AMT but was significantly inhibited by CLZ. No effect on cytochrome c oxidase was observed. These results indicate that, under the tested conditions, AMT does not appear to compromise electron flow through complexes I, II, or IV, whereas the inhibitory effect of CLZ on mitochondrial respiration involves both complexes I and II. Because NADH- and succinate-driven oxidase activities depend not only on complexes I or II but also on downstream electron transport through complexes III and IV, we next examined the direct effects of the compounds on the enzymatic activities of complexes I and II. NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase or NADH dehydrogenase is the first proton-pumping enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is considered the most susceptible to chemically induced dysfunction. Succinate dehydrogenase, in turn, is both a tricarboxylic acid (Krebs cycle) enzyme and the catalytic core of complex II of the respiratory chain [ 80 ATP synthase is a remarkable molecular motor crucial for generating ATP and sustaining mitochondrial function, and its malfunction has been linked to various pathological conditions [ 81 82 68 Our results showed that herbicides present a more significant inhibition of ATPase activity in freeze–thawing-disrupted mitochondria than intact-uncoupled mitochondria, which indicates that both compounds more specifically inhibit F o 1 73 75 o 1 The involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in triazines toxicity was described in different tissues. For instance, Thompson et al. (1974) [ 55 83 84 85 30 86 Apis mellifera 87 There are two kinds of electron transport chain inhibitors, according to Boelsterli (2007) [ 80 o 1 78 Similarly to our findings, Yamano and Morita (1995) [ 88 89 Figure 9 Although ROS production was not directly measured in this study, the reductions observed in complexes I and II provide indirect evidence that ROS generation may be involved, warranting further investigation. While the concentrations of AMT and CLZ used here exceed typical environmental levels, these herbicides are frequently detected in water and food, leading to daily exposure in consumers. Moreover, populations living in or near treated agricultural areas, as well as pesticide applicators, are regularly exposed to these chemicals [ 2 90 91 A limitation of the present study is that we did not employ classical inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, such as rotenone (complex I), antimycin A (complex III), or potassium cyanide (complex IV), which are traditionally used as positive controls to validate the site of action of xenobiotics on mitochondrial function [ 51 92 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, F.E.M.; methodology, H.P.d.S.S., C.O., C.A.M. and P.F.V.B.; investigation, H.P.d.S.S., C.O., C.A.M. and P.F.V.B.; writing—original draft preparation, H.P.d.S.S. and C.O.; writing—review and editing, F.E.M. and C.M.P.; supervision, F.E.M. and C.M.P.; funding acquisition, F.E.M.
