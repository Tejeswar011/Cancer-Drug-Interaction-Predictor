Objective Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a devastating disease with significant morbidity and mortality, despite advances in treatment. HPV-positive HNSCC, in particular, has been increasing in incidence worldwide, yet optimal management strategies remain an unmet need. While patients with HPV-positive tumors have a better prognosis and improved response to therapy compared to HPV-negative cases, the long-term toxicities associated with standard treatments necessitate a shift toward treatment de-escalation strategies. However, the lack of biomarkers to guide patient selection for de-intensified therapy remains a critical challenge. We hypothesize that cell-free HPV-DNA (cfHPV-DNA) demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and can serve as an effective non-invasive biomarker for early detection, disease monitoring, and treatment de-escalation in HPV-positive HNSCC. This meta-analysis aims to establish the clinical utility of cfHPV-DNA in diagnosing HNSCC and its potential role in guiding de-escalation strategies. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Wiley to identify studies evaluating the diagnostic value of cfHPV-DNA in HNSCC. The population included HPV-positive HNSCC patients, the intervention was cfHPV-DNA detection via liquid biopsy, and the outcome was to assess the diagnostic performance of cfHPV-DNA. The pooled diagnostic parameters were analyzed using STATA and Revman. Results Twelve studies involving 626 patients were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of cfHPV-DNA were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71 – 0.96) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.91 – 1.00), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 66.55 (95% CI: 8.9 – 497.6) and 0.12 (95% CI: 0.04 – 0.33), with a pooled diagnostic odds ratio of 574.73 (95% CI: 55 – 6019). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96 – 0.99), indicating exceptional diagnostic performance. Conclusion The high diagnostic accuracy of cfHPV-DNA supports its potential as a valuable biomarker for early detection and risk stratification in HPV-positive HNSCC. Our findings suggest that cfHPV-DNA could provide a real-time, non-invasive tool to monitor treatment response and disease progression, allowing for personalized de-escalation approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the necessary steps toward FDA approval, emphasizing the need for standardized detection methods and large-scale validation studies to facilitate its integration into clinical practice. head and neck cancer biomarker liquid biopsy cell-free DNA circulating tumor DNA National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research 10.13039/100000072 Feist-Weiller Cancer Center 10.13039/100015194 The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

While previous studies have explored the feasibility of cfHPV-DNA detection, the diagnostic accuracy and clinical applicability of this approach remain unclear as cfHPV-DNA may also derive from HPV-associated anogenital cancers ( 43 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Search strategy A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed succeeding the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) guideline ( 44  Figure 1 Figure 1 PRISMA flow chart exemplifying the study selection process included in meta-analysis and systematic review. Flowchart depicting the process of study selection from databases. Identification phase: 524 records found, 147 removed for duplication and ineligibility. Screening phase: 377 records screened, 355 excluded. Retrieval phase: 22 reports sought, all retrieved and assessed. Eligibility phase: 10 reports excluded for irrelevance. Inclusion phase: 12 studies included. 2.2 Eligibility criteria For this review, the eligibility criteria was designed according to the Population, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes, and Study designs (PICOS) framework. Regarding the population, this included patients with HPV-positive HNSCC. The intervention was usage of liquid biopsy with cfHPV-DNA and p16 detection. The comparators were the patients who had a negative test result of cfHPV-DNA. The outcome was to identify the clinical utility and diagnostic value of cfHPV-DNA in detection of patients with HPV-positive HNSCC. Our selection criteria included studies that reported cfHPV-DNA in an appropriate number of human subjects (i.e., more than 5) which included true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). Conference abstracts, year of publication, studies lacking false positives and/or false negatives, and unpublished articles were excluded. Ten articles were ineligible due to multiple reasons: data did not precisely detect cfHPV-DNA, HPV status was not confirmed within the tissues, and studies were based on in vitro in vivo 2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment A full-text search of twelve eligible articles was conducted to extract data such as the study characteristics (author’s name, year of publication), number of patients, site of cancer, HPV status of the cancer, HPV status in the blood, method of detection of viral DNA, and data used for analyses [sensitivity and specificity or true positives, false positives, false negatives, true negatives, and area under the curve (AUC) values] ( 45 56 57 2.4 Statistical analysis The software STATA (v. 18.0) and Revman (v. 5.4) were used for statistical analysis ( 58 59 60 2 61 2 3 Results 3.1 Study selection Using the predefined keywords and search strategy, an initial database search identified a total of 524 studies relevant to the use of cfHPV-DNA in HNSCC diagnosis. After removing 147 duplicate entries, 377 unique articles remained. A preliminary screening of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 355 studies based on predefined exclusion criteria. Subsequently, 22 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. After further exclusions of 10 studies due to factors such as insufficient data, lack of proper control groups, or alternative methodologies inconsistent with the inclusion criteria, a final total of 12 studies published between 2012 and 2024 were included in this meta-analysis (  Figure 1 The majority of these selected studies employed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) ( 50 52 54 56 46 48 51 53 45 49 3.2 Study characteristics Among the 12 included studies, six different high-risk HPV genotypes were investigated, including HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, and 45. Notably, all studies included HPV 16, which is the most prevalent genotype associated with HPV-driven HNSCC ( 62 63 The total number of patients included across all 12 studies was 626. The cfHPV-DNA samples were collected from one of three different biofluid sources: whole blood, serum, or plasma. This variability in sample type could contribute to heterogeneity in cfHPV-DNA detection rates across studies. The sensitivity, specificity, true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN) values for each study are presented in  Table 1 Table 1 Summary of the information and characteristics of the twelve included studies.

In addition to clinical and methodological parameters, demographic characteristics of the study populations were reviewed. Geographically, the studies were conducted across a diverse set of regions, including North America (USA), Europe (United Kingdom, France, Finland, Poland, Italy), Asia (Japan), and Australia (  Table 1 3.3 Quality assessment The quality of the included studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, a validated method for evaluating diagnostic accuracy studies (  Figure 2 Figure 2 QUADAS-2 quality assessment and risk of bias and applicability concerns of the 12 included studies.

The pooled sensitivity for cfHPV-DNA detection in blood was determined to be 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71 – 0.96), while the pooled specificity was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.91 – 1.00) (  Figure 3 Figure 3 Diagnostic performance of blood cfHPV-DNA. A Forest plot with pooled sensitivity and specificity of cfHPV-DNA for diagnosis of HNSCC. Forest plots displaying sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals for various studies. The left plot shows the sensitivity ranging from 0.71 to 0.96, with a combined sensitivity of 0.89. The right plot shows the specificity ranging from 0.91 to 1.00, with a combined specificity of 0.99. Furthermore, the area under the HSROC curve (AUC) was calculated to be 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96 – 0.99) (  Figure 4  Figure 5 Figure 4 HSROC curve with pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of cfHPV-DNA in detection of HNSCC.

Forest plot comparing DLR positive and negative values with 95 percent confidence intervals across multiple studies. Each study is represented by a horizontal line intersecting a vertical dashed line. Studies listed include Cao et al. 2012 to Siravegna et al. 2022. Combined DLR positive is 66.55 with a range from 8.90 to 497.60, and combined DLR negative is 0.12 with a range from 0.04 to 0.33. To further evaluate the overall diagnostic effectiveness, the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was estimated at 574.73 (95% CI: 55 – 6019) (  Figure 6 Figure 6 Forest plot for diagnostic odds ratio for diagnostic accuracy of cfHPV-DNA in the blood of HNSCC patients. Forest plot showing diagnostic scores and odds ratios with confidence intervals for various studies. The left section displays diagnostic scores ranging from 0.0 to 8.7, with a combined score of 6.35. The right section shows odds ratios from 0 to 6169, with a combined value of 574.73. Each study is plotted with error bars, and a dashed line indicates the reference point. The studies include works from 2012 to 2022, with each study represented by a square on a line. Red diamonds represent combined estimates for both scores and odds ratios. To account for heterogeneity across the studies, we performed Cochrane’s Q test and the I² test (  Figures 3  6 Although this meta-analysis focused primarily on diagnostic accuracy, it is noteworthy that several included studies also reported serial cfHPV-DNA measurements during treatment. In these studies, rapid decline or complete clearance of cfHPV-DNA correlated with favorable response, while delayed or incomplete clearance was associated with disease persistence or early relapse. These findings support the potential role of cfHPV-DNA as a dynamic biomarker for treatment adaptation and reinforce its clinical relevance in the context of de-intensified therapy in HPV-positive HNSCC. 3.5 Publication bias To assess potential publication bias in the included studies, Deeks’ funnel plot asymmetry test was conducted (  Figure 7 Figure 7 Deeks’ Funnel plot test for publication bias. Scatter plot titled “Deeks' Funnel Plot Asymmetry Test” with a p-value of 0.07. The x-axis shows the Diagnostic Odds Ratio, and the y-axis represents 1/root(ESS). Black circles represent study points with a blue dashed regression line. Points are scattered around the line, indicating symmetry analysis results. 4 Discussion This meta-analysis provides compelling evidence supporting the diagnostic accuracy of cfHPV-DNA as a non-invasive biomarker for detecting HPV-positive HNSCC. By analyzing data from 12 studies and 626 patients, we determined that cfHPV-DNA detection in blood demonstrates a pooled sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71 – 0.96) and a pooled specificity of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.91 – 1.00). Furthermore, the area under the HSROC curve (AUC) was calculated to be 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96 – 0.99), indicating an exceptionally strong ability to distinguish between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases. The high diagnostic positive likelihood ratio (DLR+) of 66.55 and the negative likelihood ratio (DLR−) of 0.12 confirm that cfHPV-DNA testing has substantial diagnostic utility, where a positive test strongly indicates disease presence, while a negative test significantly reduces the likelihood of HNSCC. Additionally, the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 574.73 (95% CI: 55 – 6019) further supports cfHPV-DNA as a highly effective and discriminative diagnostic tool. Together, these results confirm that cfHPV-DNA has significant diagnostic potential and could serve as a valuable addition to existing detection methods for HPV-positive HNSCC. In HPV-associated HNSCC, the oropharynx is the most commonly affected site, accounting for the majority of cases ( 4 6 7 8 9 11 34 56 Beyond diagnosis, cfHPV-DNA could also play a role in clinical decision-making, particularly in treatment de-escalation strategies ( 42 29 30 50 55 42 Despite the promising results, cfHPV-DNA testing has not yet received FDA approval for clinical use in HNSCC diagnosis, and several key challenges must be addressed before it can be integrated into routine clinical practice. One of the primary barriers is the lack of large-scale, multi-center prospective trials that comprehensively validate cfHPV-DNA’s sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility across diverse patient populations. Although the available data strongly support its diagnostic potential, regulatory approval requires a higher level of clinical validation with standardized protocols. Another challenge is the variability in detection methodologies, as different studies have used droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR), conventional PCR (cPCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS). These methodological differences introduce inconsistencies in cfHPV-DNA detection, emphasizing the need for a standardized, widely accepted assay with reproducible performance. Among the different detection methods used for cfHPV-DNA analysis, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) appears to offer several advantages over other platforms. ddPCR provides absolute quantification of target DNA without the need for standard curves, offering higher sensitivity and precision compared to quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is more susceptible to variability and lower detection limits. Although qPCR is more widely available and generally less expensive, its lower sensitivity may limit its utility for detecting minimal residual disease. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques offer comprehensive genomic profiling capabilities, but they are considerably more complex, time-consuming, and costly, which may limit their routine clinical use. Given these factors, ddPCR currently represents a preferable method for cfHPV-DNA detection in clinical practice due to its balance of high sensitivity, reproducibility, and moderate cost, although further standardization and validation are needed for widespread adoption. Additionally, the clinical significance of cfHPV-DNA in guiding patient management remains to be fully established. While cfHPV-DNA shows strong diagnostic performance, it is still unclear whether it should replace or complement existing diagnostic approaches such as tissue biopsy and p16 immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, biological factors influencing cfHPV-DNA levels, such as tumor burden, clearance, and treatment effects, need to be better understood to ensure its reliability across different clinical scenarios. The half-life of cfHPV-DNA in blood is relatively short, with studies estimating it to be within several minutes to a few hours, which can affect its detectability depending on sampling time relative to tumor burden ( 64 65 A key limitation on our meta-analysis findings is the potential impact of study heterogeneity. Although a random-effects model was used to account for variations in study design, differences in sample type (blood, serum, or plasma) and cfHPV-DNA detection techniques may have contributed to result variability. Additionally, the number of eligible studies was relatively small, which could limit the generalizability of our findings. This was a direct consequence of our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. To ensure the robustness and clinical relevance of our findings, we selected only high-quality studies that met stringent requirements, including confirmation of HPV-positive status by tissue-based methods, availability of full diagnostic accuracy data (TP, FP, TN, FN), and the use of validated cfHPV-DNA detection techniques. By applying these rigorous standards, we prioritized methodological consistency and data integrity over the size of the study pool. Nevertheless, expanding research efforts to include larger, well-controlled, prospective, multi-center studies with standardized methodologies will be essential to further validate cfHPV-DNA’s role in clinical practice. While this meta-analysis focused on cfHPV-DNA detection in blood-based samples (plasma, serum), saliva and oral rinse have emerged as alternative, non-invasive sources for HPV detection. Compared to blood, saliva collection is easier, non-invasive, and potentially more reflective of local viral shedding in tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract. Several studies have suggested that cfHPV-DNA detection in oral fluids such as saliva or oral rinse may offer a non-invasive approach, particularly for oropharyngeal tumors, due to their anatomical proximity to the oral cavity ( 34 46 46 34 5 Conclusion and future directions This meta-analysis demonstrates the strong diagnostic potential of cfHPV-DNA for detecting HPV-positive HNSCC and highlights its possible applications in early detection, risk stratification, and treatment de-escalation. While cfHPV-DNA testing is highly promising, further validation is needed before it can be widely adopted in clinical practice. By consolidating available data from multiple studies, our analysis strengthens the existing evidence supporting cfHPV-DNA as a diagnostic biomarker and provides a foundation for future research. To advance the clinical implementation of cfHPV-DNA testing, future efforts should focus on addressing regulatory challenges, standardizing detection assays, and conducting large-scale clinical trials. Overcoming these hurdles could enable cfHPV-DNA to become a valuable tool for early detection, treatment stratification, and long-term monitoring of HPV-positive HNSCC patients, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
