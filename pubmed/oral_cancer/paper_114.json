Objective To systematically review the most recent scientific literature regarding modern strategies for organ preservation in the treatment of non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Methods Literature search was made using PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Wiley Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov following the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival rate, which was addressed by a systematic review and meta-analysis. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Results The evidence is consistent in showing that 5-year survival of trimodality therapy is similar to radical cystectomy in selected patients, ranging between 29% and 73%. Patients undergoing bladder-sparing therapy were found to have better outcomes in terms of quality of life and sociability than those undergoing radical cystectomy. Immunotherapy is establishing itself as a strategy for organ-preservation treatment, showing complete response rates between 42% and 100%. However, most of these results have been obtained from ongoing clinical trials. Furthermore, there are still no studies comparing the efficacy among the different available therapies. Conclusion Although radical cystectomy remains the gold standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, its significant morbidity has prompted the exploration of alternative therapies. In this context, bladder preservation therapies, though supported by limited literature, emerge as a potential alternative that could offer comparable oncological outcomes in selected patients.

Additionally, cohorts are small and do not have long-term follow-up, and there are no prospective randomized studies comparing outcomes between RC and TMT. Reviews and meta-analyses published to date provide discordant results that preclude drawing concrete conclusions about therapies [ [18] [19] [20] 21 2 Acquisition of evidence and analyses The literature search was conducted using PubMed (access date: August 27, 2023), Google Scholar (access date: September 3, 2023), EMBASE (access date: September 11, 2023), Wiley Library (access date: September 11, 2023), and ClinicalTrials.gov 22 in vitro After a first phase of evidence screening based on the evaluation of titles and abstracts, 107 articles were selected for independent evaluation of their full texts by the reviewers. When there were disagreements on inclusion, these were resolved by a third reviewer. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 articles were included. The results and syntheses of each study are described in Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 Fig. 1 Figure 1 The flowchart on the stages of inclusion of studies in our systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Figure 1 For the bias risk evaluation of the studies, the Risk of Bias 2 and the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Exposure (ROBINS-E) tools for randomized and non-randomized studies according to Cochrane Collaboration were used to assess the bias risk classification of the studies [ [23] [24] [25] For quality evaluation of the studies included, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) standard in the Cochrane Collaboration was used for quality classification [ 26 For the evaluation and comparison of the target clinical outcome, a meta-analysis including only studies that compared TMT and RC was performed. GraphPad Prism v10.2.3 (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA, USA) and MedCalc Statistical Software version 19.2.6 (MedCalc Software bv, Ostend, Belgium) were adopted for the figure drawing and statistical analysis, respectively. Proportions, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate and compare the survival rates or OS outcomes at 5 years between TMT (intervention) and RC (control). A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis [ 27 3 Synthesis of evidence After the search, evidence was collected from 21 articles that included a total of 47 647 patients.

Figure 3 3.1 TMT Currently, the gold standard for treating MIBC is RC with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and urinary diversion. This involves removal of the bladder and its surrounding tissues, with an extended surgical time and hospital stay length, and patients requiring 3 months to 6 months to recover to baseline levels [ 5 16 28 28 6 Despite being the main treatment, RC only provides about a 49% 5-year survival [ 29 Table 1 30 5 16 16 5 15 31 5 Table 2 Giacalone et al.

[ 54 54 Several clinical trials evaluating IMT in this clinical scenario are currently underway, showing only initial results so far ( Table 4 55 56 57 57 58 59 60 4 Discussion To address the knowledge gap in bladder-sparing therapies for non-metastatic MIBC, it is essential to possess up-to-date information for informed treatment decision-making. This review offers a comprehensive knowledge base on this subject, identifying best practices, evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches, and guiding treatment strategies to meet the specific needs of each patient. RC remains the gold standard treatment and the most studied to date [ 6 [8] [9] [10] [11] 13 29 40 43 44 In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the survival of patients undergoing RC compared to TMT. Only five articles were included in this section as they were the only ones containing data that allowed statistical measurement of both strategies. For the meta-analysis, a random-effects analysis was chosen over a fixed-effect analysis for three reasons: a) a high expectation of heterogeneity among the study results as there are main differences in terms of setting, design, populations, and patient selection, b) broader generalizability of the effects as selected studies show a sample of a larger population of studies and, c) the potential variability in true effect sizes and uncertainty across different studies due to between-study variability [ 27 61 62 33 40 42 33 41 45 33 34 41 Regarding the quality of evidence, to date there is only low and moderate quality, probably due to mainly retrospective studies on this topic and no complete clinical trials that addressed these therapies, which may be associated with the high risk of bias in patient-dependent domains, but low risk in outcome-dependent domains. Interestingly, the meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the gold-standard therapy RC and the bladder-preservation therapy TMT. Although the evidence available is heterogeneous, oncological outcomes of TMT are equivalent to those of RC for selected patients [ 33 34 41 45 63 39 64 5 65 30 35 37 Regarding IMT, there is still little evidence available when it comes to bladder-sparing treatments. The information available so far comes from ongoing phase 2 trials, showing initial results with complete response rates between 42% and 100% [ [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] Limitations of this review are that information on TMT comes from retrospective studies and in general, the cohorts have disparities, due to, in most of the studies, the patients who underwent TMT were those who were not candidates for RC due to comorbidity burden. As for IMT, the evidence is limited in bladder preservation therapy, so the trials performed so far include few patients, who are generally not candidates for other treatments, making direct comparison​ with other treatments impossible. 5 Future directions Just as IMT studies have used cellular approaches considering PD-L1 and PD-1 proteins, new treatments are being developed to improve BC outcomes. For example, new strategies including biomarkers [ 66 67 68 51 in vitro in vivo 51 69 6 Conclusion While RC remains the gold standard treatment for MIBC despite its high morbidity burden, bladder preservation therapies serve as an alternative that could offer equivalent oncological outcomes in selected patients with lower morbidity. This is the first study to analyze QoL between both treatments, supporting the benefit of TMT in this regard. So far, there are no high-quality data ​directly comparing these treatments; therefore, the decision of which strategy to use should be made by a multidisciplinary team that considers the available evidence in conjunction with patient preferences. In clinical practice, this offers an alternative to classical management, which could favor selected patients. Although IMT is increasingly being incorporated into clinical trials with promising results, there is still insufficient evidence for its routine use in clinical practice. The next steps should be prospective randomized comparative studies between the different approaches to understand which may be best for each type of patient.
