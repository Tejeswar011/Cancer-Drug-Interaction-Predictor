Introduction Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare but highly distinctive malignancy within the head and neck cancer spectrum. NPC is characterized by unique epidemiological patterns, strong association with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, and pronounced geographic clustering in endemic regions including Southeast Asia, North Africa, and the Mediterranean basin [ 1 2 3 4 The management of locally advanced NPC has evolved significantly over the past decades [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Positron emission tomography with [ 18 18 14 12 15 18 16 15 2 The primary objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the relationship between baseline [ 18 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Nuclear Medicine Unit of Villa Sofia-Cervello Hospital, Palermo, Italy, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and local institutional guidelines. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the analysis. 2.2. Patient Population and Inclusion Criteria We systematically reviewed the medical records in the hospital RIS/PACS system (Elephant v.2, Agfa HealthCare, Mortsel, Belgium) of all patients diagnosed with NPC who underwent baseline [ 18 18 2 2 2 2.3. PET/CT Acquisition Protocol All patients underwent [ 18 18 18 2.4. Image Analysis and Quantitative PET Parameters Image analysis was performed using dedicated software (Advantage Workstation, GE Healthcare, version 4.3, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Two nuclear medicine physicians, each with over 10 years of experience, independently reviewed all studies, and any disagreements were resolved through a consensus meeting. The primary tumor was identified and segmented using visual identification. An automatic segmentation was performed using 40% of SUVmax threshold with manual adjustment when necessary to exclude physiological uptake, in order to extract MTV. The 40% SUVmax threshold was selected based on its established validation in head and neck cancer literature and its demonstrated correlation with clinical outcomes [ 17 18 19 2.5. NAC Response Assessment Response to NAC was evaluated based on morphological changes observed on post-treatment CT scans using RECIST 1.1 criteria. According to these morphologic criteria, patients were classified as responders if they achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), and as non-responders if they showed stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). The evaluation was based exclusively on anatomical changes in tumor size following NAC, as measured on CT images. Baseline PET/CT parameters were used solely as predictive biomarkers of subsequent morphological response and were not employed for direct response classification. For statistical analyses, patients were dichotomized into responders (CR + PR) and non-responders (SD + PD). 2.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 28.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (range) as appropriate. Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages. Comparisons between groups were performed using Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. Patient Characteristics The final study cohort comprised 27 patients (20 males and 7 females) with a mean age of 60.8 years. The undifferentiated non-keratinizing subtype was the most frequent histotype, and the majority of patients had T3/N2 stage disease at diagnosis. All patients were classified as stage III according to TNM 8th edition [ 20 Table 1 3.2. Baseline PET/CT Parameters Baseline PET/CT parameters are detailed in Table 2 3.3. NAC Response A total of 19 patients (70.4%) demonstrated a response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereas 8 patients (29.6%) were classified as non-responders. Among the responders, 12 patients (63.2%) achieved a partial response, while 7 patients (36.8%) achieved a complete response. 3.4. Correlation Between PET Parameters and NAC Response A statistically significant correlation was observed between baseline PET parameters and NAC response ( Table 3 p p p Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed the predictive value of baseline PET parameters. SUVmax showed the highest discriminative ability (AUC = 0.782), followed by MTV (AUC = 0.738), SUVmean (AUC = 0.724), and TLG (AUC = 0.632). Optimal cut-off values and corresponding sensitivity/specificity measures are reported in Table 4 Figure 1 4. Discussion The main advantage of PET-CT scans is their capacity to identify diseases at an early stage, a factor that can be pivotal for timely and effective treatment. By enabling early diagnosis, they support the development of more targeted therapeutic strategies and improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, PET-CT plays a crucial role in cancer staging and in monitoring treatment response, thanks to its ability to reveal metabolic changes that may remain undetectable with conventional imaging methods [ 21 This study evaluated the predictive role of baseline [ 18 22 22 23 Our findings are consistent with previous studies in head and neck cancers [ 15 16 24 25 24 15 16 25 26 The establishment of clinical thresholds (SUVmax > 12.5, MTV > 20 cm 3 27 28 29 Several limitations should be acknowledged in interpreting these results. The retrospective nature of the study and relatively small sample size limit the generalizability of findings. The heterogeneity in chemotherapy regimens, although reflecting real-world clinical practice, may have influenced response rates. Additionally, the threshold methodology for MTV calculation (40% of SUVmax) was fixed rather than optimized for this specific population. The study cohort predominantly consisted of patients with undifferentiated non-keratinizing carcinoma (92.6%), while only a small minority (7.4%) had squamous cell carcinoma. Due to the very limited number of cases with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 2), a subgroup analysis according to histological subtype was not feasible. Consequently, the potential influence of histological heterogeneity on the study results cannot be fully assessed. The limited number of patients in the study prevented the use of multivariate logistic regression to control for potential confounding variables including age, sex, EBV status, and Ki-67 proliferation index. Larger-scale investigations involving more extensive patient populations are needed to enable comprehensive multivariate statistical modeling, which would provide a more definitive assessment of whether baseline PET/CT metrics can independently predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. The relatively short follow-up period limits our ability to assess long-term survival outcomes and their correlation with PET parameters. Future prospective studies with larger cohorts and standardized treatment protocols are needed to validate these findings. Future research will focus on using artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics to analyze PET/CT imaging data. Radiomics enables researchers to extract numerous quantitative measurements from medical images, capturing the variability in radiotracer distribution at a level of detail that traditional metrics like SUVmax or MTV cannot achieve [ 30 31 32 5.
