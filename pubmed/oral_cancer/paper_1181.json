Introduction Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, affecting approximately 38.2% of adults worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 5 4 Early diagnosis of MASLD is essential, highlighting the need for the implementation of accessible, non-invasive and reliable diagnostic tools beyond standard reference imaging techniques [ 6 7 4 4 8 9 10 6 11 4 12 7 4 In the United States, the median age of people with MASLD was 50 years in 2015 [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 19 22 24 25 26 While sex-differences in MASLD are increasingly acknowledged [ 17 19 24 27 28 29 This observational study aims to evaluate sex differences in a population of MASLD over 50 years of age in anthropometric data, clinical profile (biochemical markers and non-invasive indicators of steatosis, fibrosis and cardiometabolic risk), and FibroScan ® ® 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Participants A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in all consecutive patients aged ≥ 50 years and diagnosed with MASLD [ 4 30 31 This is a secondary analysis of cohort data collected for the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of serum biomarkers in monitoring MASLD progression and metabolic complications over time. Considering that menopause typically occurs between the ages of 45–55 [ 32 33 34 Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age younger than 50 years; (2) concomitant chronic liver diseases (e.g., viral, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis); (3) the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignancies; (4) excessive alcohol intake, defined as intake of >140 g/week for women, >210 g/week for men, detected with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire [ 4 2.2. Anthropometric Assessment Anthropometric measurements, including height (Ht), body weight (BW), and waist circumference (WC), were obtained during the clinical visit. Height and weight were measured with participants barefoot and wearing light clothing using a calibrated scale equipped with a standard stadiometer. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m 2 WC was measured at the level of the umbilicus with the patient standing upright, using a non-elastic anthropometric tape. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference ≥80 cm in women and ≥94 cm in men as a marker of visceral obesity and high risk of metabolic complications [ 4 35 2.3. Laboratory Analysis After an overnight fast of at least 10 h, venous blood samples were obtained from all participants for biochemical analysis. Laboratory assessments included measurements of triglycerides (TG, mg/dL), total cholesterol (TC, mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, mg/dL), fasting plasma glucose (FPG, mg/dL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, IU/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, IU/L), serum creatinine (Cr, mg/dL), and C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/L). Quantitative estimation of biochemical parameters was performed in the central laboratory of the institute hospital participating to this study according to standard laboratory procedures using proprietary reagents on the fully automated biochemical analyzer Abbott Architect c16000 (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography analyzer (Lifotronic Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, mg/dL) was estimated using the Friedewald formula. 2.4. Non-Invasive Liver Disease Assessment (NILDAs) MASLD was diagnosed in patients with evidence of hepatic steatosis detected by abdominal ultrasound or a FLI score ≥ 60 [ 30 4 31 The FLI was calculated using the established formula that includes BMI, WC, TG, and GGT levels [ 30 Although the FLI was originally validated to identify NAFLD, recent studies have shown that MASLD overlaps almost completely with the NAFLD population [ 36 37 38 39 FIB-4 was determined by using the following formula: age [years] × AST [U/L]/(platelet count [10 9 4 For each patients the AST/ALT ratio was calculated and a value of 0.8 was considered to exclude advanced fibrosis [ 4 All participants underwent VCTE with FibroScan ® S0 (no steatosis): <248 dB/m S1 (mild): 248–267 dB/m S2 (moderate): 268–279 dB/m S3 (severe): ≥280 dB/m [ 4 40 Fibrosis staging was based on the following LSM thresholds: F0: <7.9 kPa F1 (significant): ≥7.9–9.4 kPa F2 (advanced): 9.5–12.4 kPa F3–4 (cirrhosis): ≥12.5 kPa These cut-offs are consistent with established guidelines for non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis [ 4 41 42 2.5. Cardiometabolic and Adipose Tissue Dysfunction Indices Visceral adiposity index (VAI) was defined using WC, BMI, TG, and HDL-C according to the published sex-specific formula: Males: VAI = (WC [cm]/(39.68 + (1.88 × BMI [kg/m 2 Females: VAI = (WC [cm]/(36.58 + (1.89 × BMI [kg/m 2 A VAI cut-off of 1.93 was used to identify adipose tissue dysfunction [ 43 44 The TyG Index (TyG) was calculated as: Ln [TG (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2]. TyG-WHtR [ 45 46 2.6. Lifestyle and Other Variables Data on age (years), sex, T2D and hypertension diagnosis, use of antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic medication, cigarette smoking status were collected through oral interviews. Smoking status was classified into three categories: current smoker, former smoker, and never smoker. T2D was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, clinical diagnosis by a clinician, and/or use of antidiabetic medication [ 47 Alcohol consumption was assessed using the validated Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire. A score below 8 was considered indicative of low-risk drinking or abstinence [ 48 Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the adapted 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). A score of ≥9 was used as the threshold to categorize participants into high or low adherence groups [ 49 2.7. Ethics Statement The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [ 50 2.8. Statistical Analysis Calculation of the sample size required to detect a medium effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.5) at a significance level of α = 0.05 and a desired power of 0.90 indicated a total sample size of 192 participants, including 64 in group 1 and 128 in group 2 (Power estimation was performed using G-Power version 3.1.9.4 software; Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of the data distribution. Group comparisons were performed using Student’s t A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to examine the significant effect of sex on two dependent variables (CAP and LSM), adjusted for potential confounders. Logistic regression model was used to evaluate the predictive ability of FLI for liver steatosis defined by CAP ≥ 248 dB/m, with adjustment for confounders and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated separately for men and women. To test the statistical difference between the two AUC curves, the DeLong test statistic was applied (using the free statistical software R 4.5.1). Sex-stratified cross-tab analyses were performed to assess the association between FLI ≥ 60 and liver steatosis (CAP ≥ 248 dB/m), and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of this cut-off were calculated for each sex. In all analyses, a p 3.

Discussion Although MASLD is less prevalent in women [ 52 53 24 54 27 17 55 56 57 58 However, despite this convergence in prevalence, sex-related differences in clinical presentation, disease progression, and outcomes beyond midlife remain poorly defined. Our results suggest that, after menopause, although women may appear metabolically healthier based on conventional clinical and biochemical parameters, a sex-specific analysis reveals a more unfavorable liver profile: despite mean transaminase levels were higher in men, applying sex-specific cut-offs (i.e., ALT ≥ 25 U/L and AST ≥ 26 U/L) [ 4 51 4 59 NILDAs analysis also revealed similar mean FLI and FIB-4 levels in both sexes, and men had significantly higher mean CAP than women. On the other hand, when the population was stratified based on standard CAP and LSM cut-offs for steatosis and fibrosis, we found that the rate of early fibrosis (F1) was almost doubled in women. In addition, women had a higher AST/ALT ratio than men, which is recognized as a marker of liver inflammation [ 4 60 61 62 63 64 4 Adipose tissue distribution changes with age and differs significantly between sexes [ 15 57 65 66 67 68 69 70 69 71 69 72 73 74 62 69 75 In men, lower subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) levels contribute to greater ectopic fat deposition throughout life [ 25 70 56 76 77 25 The difference in SAT and VAT before and after menopause in women may also explain the differences in ALT and CRP levels observed in our study. Elevated liver enzymes, reflecting fat accumulation in the liver [ 78 79 80 81 82 83 In our study, although higher absolute body weight and WC in men suggest a greater metabolic burden, sex-specific cut-offs show that women have increased total and visceral adiposity combined with more frequent early-stage liver fibrosis (F1). In addition, elevated cardiometabolic indices (e.g., VAI, TyG-WHtR) and more frequent exceeding of thresholds for these indices suggest greater metabolic dysregulation after menopause, likely driven by visceral adipose dysfunction and increased systemic inflammation, which may contribute to the observed sex differences after menopause [ 25 In our population, a FLI was a good indicator of steatosis in men, but lacked specificity and negative predictive value in women. ROC analysis, also, highlights a low ability of FLI showed to detect hepatic steatosis in women, even after adjustment for several risk factors. On the other hand, the AASLD has reported limited accuracy of the CAP in quantifying hepatic steatosis [ 84 85 86 4 Although a FLI ≥ 60 in postmenopausal women shows limited accuracy in predicting steatosis as assessed by CAP, it still indicates an underlying metabolic risk especially when combined with other parameters associated with increased risk, such as WHtR, BMI, and WC. Some studies recommend substantially lower FLI cut-offs for women [ 11 86 87 88 11 Overall, this supports the hypothesis that women with a positive FLI but no steatosis detected by CAP may be in the early stages of MASLD (S0-S1), that CAP may underestimate steatosis in women, and that fibrosis may develop even in the absence of CAP-detected liver steatosis. This may explain the observed “sex paradox”, characterized by a non-linear trajectory of MASLD prevalence and progression across different ages and metabolic risk factors [ 19 25 25 89 90 The latest EASL-EASD-EASO guidelines identify men over 50, postmenopausal women, and individuals with multiple cardiometabolic risk factors as being at increased risk for progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis [ 4 57 These results must be interpreted taking into account the objectives and limitations. First, the identification of MASLD relied on non-invasive methods such as FLI and abdominal ultrasound rather than liver biopsy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosing liver fibrosis. However, FLI has shown predictive value for steatosis in various populations [ 30 91 92 Key strengths include a well-characterized study population and the use of multiple non-invasive indices to assess steatosis, fibrosis, and cardiometabolic risk. Notably, the inclusion of VCTE provides a reliable assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. VCTE is a validated, cost-effective and non-invasive alternative to magnetic resonance elastography and liver biopsy, with strong correlation to histological findings in patients with NAFLD [ 93 5. Conclusions While MASLD has historically been considered more prevalent in men, projections suggest a faster rate of increase among women by 2040 [ 94 95 96 25 97 98 99 100 The results of this study suggest that a more tailored approach is critical in postmenopausal women, especially those over 50, where increases in visceral fat may accelerate the progression of MASLD in women, even though healthier clinical appearances may delay diagnosis [ 25 25 Acknowledgments During the preparation of this manuscript, the authors used ChatGPT (version GPT-4, OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA) for the text summary and revision.
