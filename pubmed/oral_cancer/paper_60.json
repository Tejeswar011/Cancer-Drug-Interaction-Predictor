While previous reviews have explored the broad spectrum\nof organoselenium chemistry and their applications, this review focuses\nspecifically on aminic organoselenium compounds as next-generation\nGPx mimics and radical-trapping antioxidants. This work presents a\ncomprehensive analysis of their catalytic mechanisms and structure–activity\nrelationships (SAR) and the methodologies employed to evaluate their\nantioxidant efficacy. Unlike earlier reviews, this work emphasizes\nthe critical role of aminic moieties in enhancing GPx-like activity\nand dual functionalities (peroxide decomposition and radical quenching).\nKey topics include the design principles of aminic organoselenium\ncompounds, their performance relative to classical antioxidants like\nebselen and α-tocopherol, and their promising use in developing\ntreatments for conditions linked to oxidative stress. By consolidating\nadvancements from the past two decades, this review connects existing\nresearch areas and suggests valuable pathways for future studies in\ndeveloping multifunctional organoselenium antioxidants.

Research into Se is driven by its essential role\nin selenoproteins,\nwhich are vital for mitigating oxidative damage from excessive reactive\noxygen species (ROS). The identification of selenocysteine (SeCys),\nthe redox-active, Se-containing 21st amino acid encoded genetically\nwithin selenoproteins, represents a critical finding, as it plays\nan essential antioxidant role in human pathological processes.   K a K a  2 2 2 The GPx-family comprises four selenium-dependent\nenzymes (GPx1–4),\neach characterized by a catalytically essential selenocysteine (SeCys)\nresidue. Among these, GPx1 is the most ubiquitous isoform. GPx2 is\npredominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, GPx3 is a secreted\nextracellular enzyme, and GPx4 is unique for its ability to reduce\nphospholipid hydroperoxides. Scheme 1 Illustration of the Catalytic Cycle\nEmployed by GPx Enzymes GPx-SeH reduces the peroxides into selenenic\nacid (GPx-SeOH).\nThis acid then reacts with GSH to produce a selenyl sulfide (GPx-SeSG),\nwhich is subsequently reduced back to the active selenol by a second\nGSH molecule. Glutathione reductase (GR) serves to reduce the oxidized\nGSH, i.e., GSSG using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\n(NADPH) as a cofactor.  Peroxides\nand other ROS serve as essential components that, upon\nrelease from neutrophils, are involved in redox signaling processes\nand provide a defense mechanism against pathogenic agents.  2 2 k inh 5 N–H O–H 2 N–H Since the finding\nof SeCys at the active site of the GPx, researchers\nare increasingly developing diverse organoselenium compounds exhibiting\nbiological activities, including antioxidant properties.

In silico molecular docking simulations revealed\npromising Moldock\nscores between these antioxidants and human 15-lipoxygenase-2 enzyme.\nIn silico study of human 15-LOX-2 enzyme showed that the binding energy\nvalues for antioxidants carrying a selenomethyl group on a small chain\ndemonstrated good affinity. It is therefore both lipid peroxidation\nand lipoxygenase catalysis may contribute differently to ferroptosis\nin other cell types depending on lipophilicity. Future studies is\nrequired in order to understand how lipid peroxidation is involved\nparticularly in ferroptosis. It is anticipated that the radical-trapping,\nGPx-like and antiferroptotic activity mechanisms of all organoselenium\nantioxidants will enable the development of highly efficient inhibitors\nof ferroptosis that may be useful as therapeutics in diseases caused\nby lipid peroxidation for future diseases. Some selenylated\nanalogs 41 42 43 4 Conclusions and Future Perspectives The present review highlights a series of simple aminic organoselenium\ncompounds designed to mimic selenoproteins, particularly GPx enzymes.\nAn adjacent aminic moiety significantly boosts the GPx-like activity\nof these organoselenium catalysts. A precise understanding of the\nsteric and electronic interplay between the Se center and the aminic\ngroup during catalysis has provided valuable guidance for designing\nnew organoselenium molecules with improved GPx-mimetic properties. Some strong evidence is concluded from the above survey of aminic\norganoselenium compounds that enhanced their antioxidant activity.\nThe presence of strong Se···O/N interactions within\nselenyl sulfide intermediates impedes the biological efficacy of amine-containing\ndiselenides by facilitating thiol exchange reactions. Therefore, the\nantioxidant capacity of an organoselenium compound is enhanced by\nsubstituents that promote the nucleophilic attack of a thiol on sulfur\nwithin its selenenyl sulfide adduct. The higher activity observed\nfor sec tert tert In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of developing\nnovel, simple aminic organoselenium compounds that effectively mimic\nselenoproteins. The advancements discussed here along with the identified\nresearch perspectives are expected to stimulate further innovation\nin organoselenium chemistry. While significant progress has been made,\nkey challenges and opportunities remain to be addressed. Few promising\ndirections and challenges remain unexplored, which could shape future\nresearch in this field as future perspectives: (i) Structural Optimization\nand Design; (ii) Mechanistic Elucidation; (iii) Biological Applications;\n(iv) Evaluation Methods; (v) Toxicity and Safety; (vi) Clinical Translation;\n(vii) Application of Emerging Technologies, e.g., AI-Driven Discovery\nand CRISPR Screening.
