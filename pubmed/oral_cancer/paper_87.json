The intestinal immune compartment plays a central role in HIV pathogenesis, serving as an early site for viral replication and a significant reservoir for latent infection. Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing plasma viremia, HIV persists indefinitely in latently infected cells, commonly found in the intestinal tract due to its unique immunological and structural environment. Targeting HIV-infected cells that persist in the intestinal tract is an important consideration for therapeutic strategies and is also important when considering an HIV cure. This review describes the therapeutic approaches aimed at addressing HIV persistence in the intestinal tract, or gut. We provide a brief overview of mechanisms underlying reservoir formation and maintenance, discuss the challenges posed by gut-specific factors, and examine emerging strategies, including latency reversal agents, immune modulation, gut-targeted ART, and novel delivery systems. This review will focus on contemporary advances in knowledge in this space, gaps in the literature and areas for future research focus.

Multiple factors converge in the gut to promote HIV latency and persistence despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Early reservoir seeding during acute infection, combined with a tolerogenic mucosal environment and immune-evasive tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, establishes a durable reservoir. Chronic immune activation driven by microbial translocation, along with gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) fibrosis, impairs immune clearance.

Each factor is paired with an illustrative icon.

TRM are long-lived, non-recirculating cells that localize to mucosal barrier sites and are poised for rapid immune responses upon local antigen re-encounter ( 50 51 + 52 53 + 54 + + 55 55 54 56 57 54 58 54 55 2.2 Persistent immune activation and inflammation fuel HIV persistence Chronic immune activation is a hallmark of HIV infection and a key driver of reservoir persistence (  Figure 1 43 + 59 62 22 63 29 64 66 67 68 Although ART effectively suppresses plasma viremia, it does not fully restore gut epithelial integrity or microbiome diversity ( 22 67 69 70 67 71 73 74 2.3 Gut microbiota, dysbiosis and microbial translocation Recent findings suggest that gut microbiota composition may modulate reservoir size and immune control. A recent germ-free humanised mouse model demonstrated the role the microbiome plays in HIV persistence, with lower levels of HIV replication in plasma and tissues of germ-free mice, depleted of their resident microbiota, compared with conventional humanised mice ( 75 Bacteroidales: Clostridiales 76 Bacteroidales 77 78 The presence and mechanism of a causal link between gut barrier dysfunction, microbial translocation, systemic inflammation and HIV persistence is not well understood ( 79 80 2.4 ARV penetration in the gut: barriers to reservoir elimination Reduced antiretroviral drug penetration in the gut may pose a challenge to the elimination of the HIV reservoir in this compartment. Studies have shown that mucosal tissue penetrance varies with antiviral agents; due to a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors (protein binding, molecular size, lipophilicity, ionization, and blood perfusion), physical barriers, as well as efflux and uptake transporter expression ( 5 5 81 82 83 81 84 85 86 6 87 88 6 in vivo ex vivo ( 7 90 8 89 36 38 3 Emerging therapeutic approaches 3.1 Latency modulating agents Latency reversal agents (LRAs) aim to reactivate latent HIV to increase virus transcription, protein expression and virion production (  Figure 2 90 in vitro, ex vivo in vivo 90 93 Figure 2 Emerging therapeutic strategies for targeting the HIV reservoir in the gut. Strategies include: (1) latency-modulating agents to induce viral gene expression; (2) gut-homing pathway modulation via integrin-targeting antibodies; (3) immune-based therapies to enhance clearance of infected cells; (4) broadly neutralizing antibodies to block infection and mediate cytotoxicity; (5) interventions to restore gut barrier integrity and reduce inflammation; (6) cell-based therapies, (7) gene-editing and CRISPR-based approaches; and (8) targeted delivery platforms such as nanoparticles and antibody-drug conjugates to improve localization and efficacy of therapeutics within the gastrointestinal tract. Together, these approaches aim to overcome anatomical and immunological barriers to HIV cure. Therapeutic strategies for targeting the gut-based HIV reservoir are presented. Sections include gene editing and CRISPR technologies, latency modulating agents, modulating gut homing pathways, immune modulation strategies, broadly neutralizing antibodies, restoring gut barrier integrity, cell-based therapies, and cell and tissue-specific delivery platforms. Each section contains diagrams illustrating mechanisms like lipid nanoparticles, hydrogel formulations, TLR agonists, and cytokine therapies. The central theme emphasizes improving HIV treatment by targeting gut reservoirs.  Ex vivo 39  Figure 1 Emerging immunomodulatory LRAs, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, TLR-1/2, TLR7, and TLR9 ( 94 97 98 95 99 100 101 ex vivo 102 While considerable progress has been made in the development of latency reversal strategies, there is limited evidence supporting the efficacy of LRAs in the gut. Latency reversing effects in colonic and rectal tissue have been demonstrated in clinical trials of the HDACis panobinostat and vorinostat ( 103 104 99 An alternative latency-modulating approach under investigation, the “block and lock” strategy, seeks to drive HIV into a long-lived, transcriptionally silent state. This has been studied with agents such as bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) modulators ( 105 106 108 109 110 111 112 113 113 114 3.2 Modulating gut-homing pathways through antibody-based interventions CD4+ T cells migrate into gastrointestinal tissues by engaging α4β7 integrin, expressed on their surface, with MAdCAM-1, a key adhesion molecule found on the gut endothelium ( 115 116 117 118 118 121 Treatment with anti-α4β7 therapy [vedolizumab (VDZ)] in PWH on ART with concomitant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has demonstrated promise in attenuating the formation of lymphoid aggregates within the gut ( 122 123 126 127 128 129 130 131 In addition to α4β7, other trafficking molecules such as CCR9, which is important for gut homing particularly in Th17 cells during HIV infection ( 132 133 3.3 Immune modulation strategies to enhance HIV reservoir clearance Immune modulation strategies aim to restore antiviral immunity, reduce chronic inflammation, and enhance the immune system’s capacity to recognize and eliminate infected cells within mucosal tissues ( 134 + 134 135 136 Cytokine-based therapies, such as IL-15 superagonists may enhance mucosal effector responses ( 137 138  Figure 2 137 + 139 140 Emerging bispecific platforms like ImmTAVs- soluble, engineered T-cell receptors (TCRs) fused to anti-CD3, redirect polyclonal CD8 + + 141 142 143 144 Immune-based approaches must carefully balance antiviral activity with the preservation of mucosal barrier function and limitation of inflammation-induced damage. Refinement of these strategies is ongoing, aiming to enhance antiviral responses while preserving mucosal integrity. For instance, targeted delivery mechanisms, such as nanoparticle formulations and antibody-drug conjugates (Section 2.7) are being explored to localize immune modulation to mucosal tissues and reduce systemic toxicity. Combinatorial approaches, such as pairing cytokines like IL-15 or IL-21 with checkpoint blockade ( 145 146 147 3.4 Broadly neutralizing antibodies Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can induce direct viral neutralization and immune responses through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) ( 148 151 152 153 154 3.5 Restoring gut barrier integrity and reducing inflammation A wide array of therapeutic strategies has been explored to target the gut microbiome in PWH, aiming to reduce persistent inflammation and immune dysfunction despite effective ART (  Figure 2 Antibiotics, administered experimentally, have shown mixed outcomes, with some studies in nonhuman primates (NHPs) suggesting reduced gut inflammation and altered susceptibility to SIV infection, however concerns remain about long-term dysbiosis and resistance ( 155 156 157 155 Prebiotics and probiotics have demonstrated modest benefits on immune markers in some exploratory trials ( 158 160 161 163 164 155 More recently, attention has shifted to postbiotics and live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) driven by progress in the treatment of Clostridium difficile ( 165 166 167 159 168 169 170 171 172 Therapies aimed at reducing systemic inflammation or restoring gut barrier integrity in PWH target key drivers such as microbial translocation, residual viral replication, and immune dysregulation. Investigational approaches include anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., statins ( 173 176 177 178 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 179 180 184 185 NCT02431325 186 187 188 189 While several of these strategies have demonstrated reductions in biomarkers of inflammation, their capacity to meaningfully improve immune function or reduce clinical comorbidities in PWH has yet to be definitively established. Together, these findings underscore the complexity of therapeutically targeting the gut in PWH and highlight a critical need for rigorously designed, mechanistically informed studies to identify microbiota-directed or gut-specific interventions that can durably reduce inflammation, restore mucosal integrity, and ultimately contribute to HIV remission or cure strategies. 3.6 Therapeutic vaccines to restore gut immunity and reduce mucosal inflammation Therapeutic vaccines represent a promising avenue for enhancing gut immunity in PWH. By targeting the gut mucosa, these strategies aim to restore immune function, reduce inflammation, and improve overall health outcomes in PWH. Several approaches are under investigation, including intranasal or mucosal vaccines adjuvanted with IL-13Rα2 blockers, which have been shown to enhance mucosal CD8 + 190 191 192 Lactococcus lactis 193 While prophylactic mRNA HIV vaccines are progressing (e.g., NCT05001371, NCT05414786 NCT05217641 194 195 196 198 199 201 202 203 204 205 3.7 Gene and cell-based therapeutic strategies Gene editing technologies, particularly CRISPR-based approaches, have emerged as promising tools for targeting persistent HIV reservoirs. These strategies are especially relevant to GALT, where therapeutic interventions must be able to access, persist, and function effectively. Viral-directed approaches aim to excise integrated provirus ( 206 207 208 209 210 206 211 Host-directed approaches aim to render target cells resistant to infection or to enhance antiviral immunity in mucosal compartments ( 212 in vitro, ex vivo in vivo 212 215 212 Complementary to gene editing, cell-based therapies are advancing in parallel. In nonhuman primate models, stem-cell-derived CAR T cells demonstrated superior persistence, tissue trafficking, and antiviral activity, reinforcing their potential in mucosal immune compartments ( 216 216 217 218 Together, these gene- and cell-editing strategies underscore the potential to overcome the unique barriers posed by gut reservoirs, where persistence, immune evasion, and tissue accessibility converge, positioning the gut as a critical testing ground for next-generation HIV cure interventions. 3.8 Cell and tissue-specific delivery platforms Targeting therapeutic agents directly to gut-associated lymphoid tissue represents a major challenge and opportunity in HIV cure research. The anatomical and immunological complexity of the gut ( 9 10 89 219 220 220 220 Nano-drug delivery systems (NDDs) can be engineered to enhance mucosal adhesion ( 221 222 223 224 223 225 226 227 228 Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of precision therapeutics that employ monoclonal antibodies to selectively bind cell surface antigens, enabling targeted delivery of potent cytotoxic agents to tumour cells ( 229 230 229 231 231 Beyond anatomical targeting, delivery systems are being optimized to home to specific cellular reservoirs that represent major sources of persistent HIV in the gut ( 232 233 4 Discussion The gut constitutes one of the most formidable barriers to HIV eradication. As the largest immune organ in the body, it contains the vast majority of lymphoid tissue and CD4 + 9 Eliminating HIV reservoirs in the gut will likely require a multipronged therapeutic approach. Latency-reversing agents (LRAs) have shown partial activity in gut-derived cells, but their efficacy is limited by poor tissue penetration and lack of potency in reversing deep latency. Immune-based interventions, such as broadly neutralizing antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors, hold promise for enhancing reservoir clearance, but their ability to reach and act within GALT remains to be demonstrated. Drug delivery innovations, including nanoparticle formulations and tissue-targeted vectors, may help overcome the pharmacologic barriers posed by mucosal tissues, yet require rigorous evaluation in both preclinical and clinical settings. In parallel, gene- and cell-editing approaches are emerging as transformative strategies for targeting gut HIV reservoirs. CRISPR-based interventions, such as EBT-101, and SIV-directed precursors have demonstrated broad biodistribution to lymphoid tissues, including the gut, with preclinical evidence of proviral excision. Although early clinical studies highlight the need for greater efficacy, these findings establish proof-of-concept that gene editing can indeed reach and act within GALT. Similarly, cell-based therapies, including CCR5-edited T cells and CAR-T platforms, offer the potential to repopulate the gut with resistant or effector cells capable of directly suppressing local HIV replication. The ability of engineered cells to traffic to and persist within mucosal tissues will be a critical determinant of their long-term success. Strategies aimed at restoring gut barrier integrity and reducing inflammation, such as FMT, statins, anti-cytokine therapies, and gut-tropic agents, may act synergistically to suppress the drivers of HIV persistence. Therapeutic vaccines capable of eliciting robust mucosal CD8 + To overcome the anatomical and pharmacologic challenges of targeting the gut reservoir, innovative drug delivery systems, including ligand-targeted nanoparticles and mucoadhesive formulations, are under active investigation. These platforms may improve tissue penetration, increase drug stability, and allow for targeted delivery to infected cells within the mucosal environment. Together, these efforts underscore the importance of integrating genetic engineering strategies with gut-specific delivery systems, immune modulation, and barrier-restoring interventions. The next phase of HIV cure research will require assessing not only the safety and durability of gene- and cell-editing therapies but also their functional impact on gut reservoirs. As such, trials should incorporate tissue-based endpoints, including gut biopsies and molecular reservoir profiling, to determine whether systemic interventions translate into meaningful reductions in mucosal reservoirs. Looking ahead, several key knowledge gaps remain. The field would benefit from validated biomarkers of gut reservoir size and activity to assess therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, most clinical trials do not include tissue-based endpoints, limiting our understanding of how interventions affect HIV persistence outside the peripheral blood. Longitudinal studies incorporating tissue pharmacokinetics, host immune responses, and microbiome dynamics are critical to informing rational therapeutic design. Ultimately, integration of multi-modal strategies targeting latency, inflammation, immune dysfunction, and mucosal damage will likely be necessary to achieve durable reductions in the gut HIV reservoir. In conclusion, the gut represents a uniquely challenging and significant reservoir for latent HIV despite the clinical effectiveness of ART. Rational combination therapies, guided by mechanistic insights and empowered by advanced delivery platforms, offer a promising path forward in the endeavour to eliminate HIV reservoirs in the gut. However, success will depend on continued investment in tissue-based research and the development of clinical tools to measure and target HIV persistence at this critical site.
