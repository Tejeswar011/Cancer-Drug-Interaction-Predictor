Long-term survival is rare, and treatment strategies remain nonstandardized due to limited data. In this report, the authors present a case of a 51-year-old male who presented with stage IVa laryngeal SCNC and no distant metastasis, treated with a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation, who has survived for more than 5 years. This case represented 1 of few reported instances of extended disease-free survival in laryngeal SCNC, highlighting the potential benefit of aggressive multimodal treatment, even in advanced-stage disease. In addition to diagnosis and management, this case may prompt further discussion about the role of surgery in select patients and the need for individualized, patient-centered survivorship care for management of posttreatment sequalae. Although limited to a single case, these findings underscore the need for further research into effective treatment and surveillance strategies for this rare malignancy.

The report also highlighted the importance of individualized survivorship planning, shared decision-making, and quality-of-life considerations, particularly in discussions around functional laryngectomy for posttreatment sequelae. Introduction Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC) of the larynx is a rare, poorly differentiated malignancy characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and poor survival outcomes. SCNC represents less than 1% of all laryngeal cancers, most often arising in the supraglottis, and typically impacting men in their sixth decade.  1,2  1  1  1,3  4 Due to its rarity, treatment guidelines for laryngeal SCNC are largely extrapolated from small cell lung carcinoma, which shares similarly poor prognostic features.  5,6  1,4 Although long-term survival is rare in patients with SCNC, it can be achieved, and there remains a lack of long-term outcomes data to guide clinicians as to best practices in long-term survivorship care for this unique subset of patients. In the current report, the authors present a case of a long-term survivor of stage IVa laryngeal SCNC. This case demonstrated the importance of an early and aggressive, multimodal therapeutic approach in the treatment of laryngeal SCNC. Additionally, this case highlighted the need for further review and renewed investigation into the role of surgery for the upfront, curative, and long-term survivorship treatment of this disease. Case Patient Presentation Informed consent was obtained from the patient to utilize their clinical history for this case report. In 2017, a 51-year-old White male with a 3-pack-year smoking history presented with a chief complaint of dyspnea, dysphagia, and dysphonia. He reported a 3-month history of an intermittent dysphonia, which progressed to constant, and endorsed odynophagia and a worsening productive cough. The patient underwent a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) neck, which demonstrated an enhancing transglottic mass (2.7 × 1.8 × 2.7 cm) on the right, crossing the midline at the anterior commissure to involve the left true and false vocal folds, with extension into the right paraglottic fat. At least 2 enlarged right level 3 cervical lymph nodes were identified, concerning for nodal spread ( Figure 1A Figure 2A–D Figure 1A and B Figure 1: Pre- and posttreatment imaging. ( A B C Figure 2: Biopsy of supraglottic mass . A B C D Treatment Pathway A total of 2 months after presentation, the patient began concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin and etoposide, completing 3 cycles during a 2-month period. A posttreatment PET scan ( Figure 1C Outcomes Surveillance CT and PET scans have been performed every 6 months for the past 7 years without evidence of recurrent locoregional disease or distant metastasis. As of his most recent follow-up, the patient remained disease-free. Overall, he had fair laryngeal function with intelligible Passy-Muir speech and a full oral diet without the need for enteral nutrition. However, due to substantial postradiation glottic stenosis, he remained tracheostomy dependent and continued to experience limited bilateral vocal fold mobility, dysphonia, and diffuse edema involving the larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx. Although recurrence is the primary concern in SCNC, long-term survivors often face persistent functional sequelae, including chronic airway obstruction, impaired communication, and swallowing dysfunction. These quality-of-life complications require multidisciplinary management and may influence patient decisions about further intervention. Financial toxicity can further complicate patients’ decisions. Head and neck cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to financial toxicity given the need for intense multimodal therapies for curative treatment, as well as the cost of long-term management of physical, functional, and/or psychosocial morbidities following treatment.  7 Currently, this patient has dealt with ongoing laryngeal dysfunction, prompting discussions about functional laryngectomy to improve airway stability, reduce aspiration risk, and eliminate tracheostomy dependence. Functional laryngectomy is typically reserved for patients with intractable aspiration, profound dysphagia, and a nonfunctional larynx following definitive treatment such as chemoradiation, as well as failure of conservative therapies.  8 A prospective cohort study from Evangelista et al has shown that functional laryngectomy can lead to substantial improvements in swallowing function and alaryngeal voice among survivors of head and neck cancer who developed posttreatment functional impairments following chemoradiation. In this study, 20 patients who underwent functional laryngectomy were surveyed at 6 months postsurgery, and they found that 85% of patients regained functional communication using a tracheoesophageal prosthesis, accompanied by meaningful improvements in perceived swallowing ability and quality of life.  8 In alignment with patient-centered care, the patient has elected to defer surgery while his speech, despite worsening, remains functional. His decision reflected careful considerations of the potential functional benefits of surgery alongside its impact on his communication and identity. For long-term survivors of laryngeal SCNC, functional laryngectomy may offer meaningful improvement in quality of life when tailored to individual goals and circumstances. Due to the rarity of laryngeal SCNC, management principles are mainly derived from small cell lung carcinoma guidelines, where platinum-based chemotherapy is the established standard of care for limited-stage disease.  4,5  6  4 In this case, the patient was treated with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide-based chemotherapy, mirroring the protocols established in pulmonary small cell carcinoma. This approach resulted in a durable response, with no evidence of recurrence for more than 7 years. His clinical course suggested that aggressive multimodal therapy may offer long-term benefit in carefully selected patients with locally advanced disease and no distant metastasis. Given the lack of established follow-up protocols specific to laryngeal SCNC, this case also highlighted the need for clear survivorship guidelines. The patient underwent structured biannual surveillance with alternating CT and PET imaging, which may serve as a reasonable approach in the absence of formal guidelines. In addition to radiographic monitoring, follow-up care should include routine assessment of airway stability, swallowing function, nutritional status, and communication ability. Ultimately, surgery may be considered on a case-by-case basis through shared decision-making, particularly in patients with locally advanced disease and no distant metastasis. As this report reflected a single patient experience, broader conclusions should be drawn with caution, and further research is needed to define optimal long-term care and surveillance in this rare malignancy. Conclusion This case illustrated the presentation, diagnosis, and management of advanced-stage laryngeal SCNC, a rare malignancy characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis. Thus, prompt diagnosis and management are critical. The patient’s long-term survival without evidence of disease recurrence suggested that aggressive and multimodal therapy may improve clinical outcomes of select patients with advanced local disease and no distant metastasis. Although limited to a single patient, this case contributed to the sparse literature on laryngeal SCNC and underscored the need for further research into optimal treatment strategies, including the potential role for surgery. Equally important was the incorporation of patient preferences and quality-of-life considerations into the long-term management and survivorship care for this rare malignancy.
