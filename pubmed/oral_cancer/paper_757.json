Introduction Lyotropic liquid crystalline nanoparticles can be utilized as drug delivery nanocarriers exhibiting significant technological advantages, such as their extended internal morphology of a 3D- or 2D-structured network of lipid bilayer channels embedding water that are ordered either in cubic (forming the cubosomes) or hexagonal (forming the hexosomes) mesophases [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 The stability of the non-lamellar internal structure is ensured by polymeric stabilizers that intercalate within the lipid bilayer. The mode of the lipid–polymer interactions strictly affects the physicochemical and the morphological characteristics, like the internal architecture, the drug entrapment efficiency, the exposure mode to biological barriers or cells or proteins, and thus the final pharmacokinetic and drug release profiles and bioavailability [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Phytantriol (PHYT) is a commercially available lipid, known to be used industrially in cosmetics, like skincare products, and identified to form non-lamellar lyotropic phases according to its phase diagram. One of the typical advantages of phytantriol over other fatty acid-based materials like glyceryl monooleate, is its improved chemical stability in aqueous and model gastrointestinal conditions. This advantage results from the absence of ester and unsaturated bonds, providing resistance to degradation phenomena [ 24 25 26 Although the combination of phytantriol with quaternized copolymers is not widespread, thus highlighting the novelty of the present study, there some studies reported in the literature that employed other additives—cationic amphiphiles, such as didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) [ 27 28 29 30 31 The scope of the present study is the development of new lyotropic lipidic liquid crystalline nanoparticles, prepared from phytantriol lipid, with stimuli-responsiveness (pH- and thermo-), stealthiness and highly organized internal morphologies for enhanced loading capacity. Toward this scope, we incorporated the amphiphilic block copolymer poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(lauryl methacrylate) (TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA) as polymeric stabilizer, bring partially quaternized by the delocalized cation TPP. The stabilizing ability of TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA was evaluated in two percentages, while TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA was also co-assisted by other stabilizers, namely Poloxamer P407, two poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) copolymers, and two poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)-grad-poly(2-phenyl-2-oxazoline) (MPOx) gradient copolymers, which all exhibit high biocompatibility, low toxicity and promising stealth properties. In more detail, colloidal dispersions of liquid crystalline nanoparticles from phytantriol lipid were developed, following an effective formulation process, in order to assess the exact qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the formulation, like the copolymer combination and the lipid-to-polymer ratio. Light scattering techniques (dynamic, static and electrophoretic) were applied in physicochemical and morphological terms. Additionally, the effects of pH, temperature, serum proteins and ionic strength were monitored. Cryo-TEM was applied for the morphological illustration of the systems’ internal structure. Moreover, their microenvironmental parameters, micropolarity and microfluidity, were investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Finally, the entrapment of the hydrophobic drug molecule resveratrol was attempted, and the entrapment efficiency (EE%) was assessed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on liquid crystalline nanoparticles comprising phytantriol lipid and quaternized copolymer, intended to provide stimuli-responsive cationic carriers and to elucidate the phytantriol–copolymer interactions, as a contribution to the improvement in liquid crystalline drug delivery systems. This newly proposed PHYT lipid–copolymer combination yielded to first-appeared morphological patterns, being ideal for drug loading, along with some extra provoked morphological characteristics that reinforce the advantages of the liquid crystalline nanoparticles described above, such as the loading capacity. These differences can be attributed to the differentiated lipid, i.e., the PHYT. Thus, this newly proposed PHYT lipid–copolymer combination provides novel formulations for drug delivery with upgraded functionalities. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials Phytantriol was purchased from DSM Nutritional products Ltd. (Heerlen, The Netherlands). The employed copolymers were synthesized as described below, while Pluronic ® 98 67 98 2.2. Methods 2.2.1. Synthesis of Copolymers The synthesis of the copolymers is analytically described by [ 32 33 34 Table 1 Figure S1 33 34 In the case of the TPP-PDMAEMA-b-PLMA, the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) process was applied for PDMAEMA-b-PLMA synthesis, with a two-step polymerization procedure [ 35 Supplementary Materials 1 2.2.2. Preparation Process of the Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticle Dispersion First, two different weight ratios with TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA were prepared, lipid:polymer 9:1 and 4:1, which are 10% and 20% w w Subsequently, the TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA stabilizer was combined with P407, PEO-b-PCL H1, H4, MPOx1 and MPOx2, in 20% w w Table 2 The top–down method was applied for the preparation of the formulations, as described in [ 32 2.2.3. Dynamic, Static and Electrophoretic Light Scattering Techniques The physicochemical and morphological properties considered were size (hydrodynamic radius R h R g R h d f R h t p 33 36 37 38 39 2.2.4. Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cryo-TEM) Microscopic illustration of the internal nanostructure was carried out by cryo-TEM for precise visualization of the structures [ 32 36 2.2.5. Fluorescence Spectroscopy Using pyrene as the hydrophobic probe, fluorescence spectroscopy disclosed the internal nanoparticle microenvironment (micropolarity and microfluidity). The intensity ratio of peak 1 to peak 3 of the pyrene ( I 1 I 3 I E I M I E I E 36 2.2.6. Determination of the Drug Entrapment Efficiency (EE)% Incorporation of 2 mg/mL resveratrol into the prepared nanosystems was attempted; subsequently, the non-entrapped molecules were removed and the entrapped molecules were quantified by UV−Vis spectrophotometry. More technical details may be found in Chountoulesi et al. [ 32 Supplementary Materials 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Light Scattering Results TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA had difficulties in stabilizing the PHYT lipid to nanoparticles, not only alone but also co-assisted by the other polymers, while a stepwise acidification to pH = 5.0 was required to achieve homogenous dispersions. This observation is in contrast to the respective PDMAEMA-b-PLMA-stabilized nanosystems from our previous study [ 37 40 41 Table 1 The polymeric guests had similar impact on the physicochemical properties of the formulations ( Table 3 However, we observed higher values of both size and size distribution in comparison to the glyceryl monooleate (GMO)-based respective nanosystems [ 32 42 43 Table 1 The strong positive ζ-potential in all the formulations ( Table 3 36 44 45 46 47 Figures S2 and S3 Regarding their ability to incorporate hydrophobic active agents, all the systems were found to successfully incorporate resveratrol in percentages larger than 99% ( Table S1 Section 3.2 3.1.1. Effect of Environmental Parameters The partial polymer TPP-quaternization synthesis [ 32 48 49 48 49 49 Interestingly, a pH-triggered ζ-potential variation was observed ( Figure 1 In acidic conditions (pH = 4.2), all the nanosystems maintained high positive values of ζ-potential (larger than +30 mV), becoming notably lower in physiological pH. As the literature describes, PDMAEMA is a cationic polyelectrolyte whose tertiary amine groups are fully protonated at acidic pH and becoming less ionized in neutral pH conditions [ 50 51 Presumably, this response can be related to the promotion of intracellular accumulation of the nanosystems, with targeting emphasis to pathological acidic tissues and endosomal escape. In detail, the high content of ions eventually floods and ruptures the endosomal membrane and eventually releases the nanoparticle to cytosol, thus being free to interact with the various negatively charged organelles of high targeting interest, like the mitochondria. Moreover, the strong cationic profile of the formulations is favorable in the case of gene or protein or peptide delivery systems [ 48 49 51 Regarding the behavior in the presence of serum proteins (fetal bovine serum—FBS medium), most of the nanosystems presented small increases in their size, apart from two exceptions, which showed a slight decrease ( Table 4 36 37 44 The ionic strength had an inversely proportional impact on the ζ-potential of the formulations ( Figure 2 3.1.2. Fractal Analysis Through SLS application, two morphological characteristics were estimated, namely the fractal dimension and the R g R h Table 5 According to the literature, in the case of macromolecular chains, an R g R h In HPLC-grade water, the systems exhibited different values of the R g R h 36 38 44 R g R h In contrast to the R g R h d f d f 38 25 52 3.1.3. Temperature Effect The effect of rising temperature and subsequent cooling was monitored for the physicochemical properties of the formulations, with no significant variations in hydrodynamic radius and PDI between the heating and cooling cycles ( Figure 3 Figure S5 Concerning the morphological parameters, the R g R h 36 53 L 2 Pn3m d f 3.2. Cryo-TEM Results The PHYT-based nanosystems exhibited a variety of morphological features. The PHYT:TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA 9:1 nanosystem presented nanoparticles with striated, regularly ordered, inner structure, as illustrated in Figure 4 Figure 4 1 Pn3m 54 A cubic phase with the Pn3m 25 42 Pn3m Im3m The addition of P407 as a second stabilizer to the formulation ( Figure 4 36 The increase in TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA copolymer to the 4:1 ratio resulted in the formation of two populations of nanostructures, while there was an appearance of spherical multilamellar vesicles ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Pn3m 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 The addition of the PEO-b-PCL copolymers differentiated the layout of regularly ordered structures. In the formulation with PEO-b-PCL H1, compact liquid crystalline nanoparticles of highly ordered inner structure are present ( Figure 5 Pn3m 61 Figure 5 Figure 5 In the formulation with PEO-b-PCL H4, there were the same three aforementioned categories of 3D morphologies ( Figure 5 32 The insertion of MPOx1 gradient copolymer resulted in the formation of similar nanostructures, as in the case of PEO-b-PCL-containing nanosystems. In detail, liquid crystalline nanoparticles with a highly ordered inner structure and likely space group symmetry Pn3m Figure 5 Figure 5 Finally, the insertion of the MPOx2 gradient copolymer resulted in the formation of liquid crystalline nanoparticles with a highly ordered inner structure and with likely space group symmetry Pn3m Figure 5 Figure 5 Taking into account the morphological behavior in the case of the GMO lipid in our previous study [ 32 36 As long as there are different polymeric architecture effects, the systems comprising MPOx gradient copolymers as stabilizers reflect a possibly more packed lipid bilayer structure, yielding to more compact nanoparticulate morphologies, compared to the ones comprising the di-block copolymers, TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA alone or with the di-block copolymers PEO-b-PCL/P407, while the systems comprising MPOx gradient copolymers also exhibit darker nanoparticle motifs, show less fusion phenomena and reveal more “bare” nanoparticles, without being embedded in intersecting lamellas and sponges ( Figure 5 62 3.3. Fluorescence Spectroscopy Results All of the nanosystems exhibit similar values of I 1 I 3 Table 6 We should mention that the observed micropolarity values are lower than the respective GMO nanosystems [ 32 36 Pn3m Im3m 63 42 64 By combining the results of cryo-TEM and fluorescence spectroscopy, which present the dominant existence of Pn3m Im3m Pn3m Im3m 57 65 Pn3m 20 Pn3m Im3m 66 Another significant observation is the decrease in microfluidity ( I E I M 32 65 4. Conclusions Non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanosystems were formulated from PHYT lipid and the stimuli-responsive polymer TPP-QPDMAEMA-b-PLMA, assisted by different types of other copolymers, either block copolymers Poloxamer P407 and PEO-b-PCL, or gradient copolymers MPOx. All formulations presented a strong cationic profile, along with a pH-induced ζ-potential conversion in acidic conditions that can be further utilized for intracellular targeting applications. In addition, the different polymeric combinations played a crucial role in the morphology of the nanosystems, wherein a prevailing population of compact structures with a high internal organization was found, probably due to the effect of the phytantriol lipid. This newly proposed PHYT lipid–copolymer combination yielded to a new morphologically combined nanoparticulate structure of a well-defined liquid crystalline nanoparticle of Pn3m Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics17091199/s1 a b c 98 67 98 d e R h Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.C.; methodology, M.C., N.P., B.T., S.P. and C.D.; formal analysis, M.C., N.P. and A.F.; investigation, M.C., V.C. and A.F.; data curation, M.C.; writing—original draft preparation, M.C., N.P. and A.F.; writing—review and editing, M.C., N.P., B.T., S.P. and C.D.; supervision, M.C.; project administration, M.C.; funding acquisition, M.C.
