Pangxiejiao (PXJ), a natural plant widely used in folk practices, has been found to contain bioactive compounds that exhibit hypoglycemic effects in vitro in vivo Methods An HFFD was employed to mimic unhealthy dietary habits, while PXJ was administered via oral gavage for 10 weeks. Perform biochemical assays, observe histopathological structures, and evaluate metabolic status in rats to investigate intrinsic alterations through detection of gut microbiota and plasma metabolites. Results The results demonstrated that PXJ intervention reduced body weight, improved glucose and lipid metabolism, and decreased serum uric acid levels. PXJ alleviated oxidative stress and inflammation, as evidenced by reduced serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF- α Firmicutes Bacteroidota α Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group Discussion In conclusion, early and sustained PXJ intervention alleviates HFFD-induced metabolic disorders, which is associated with restored gut microbiota balance, improved metabolism, and reduced inflammation and oxidative stress, demonstrating its potential as a novel functional tea for metabolic disorder prevention.

Meanwhile, PXJ was administered as an intervention to investigate its effects on metabolic disorders. To evaluate the effects of PXJ intervention on HFFD-induced metabolic disorders, we systematically measured blood glucose, serum lipid, and serum uric acid levels while simultaneously examining associated pathological changes in visceral tissues. HFFD-induced metabolic disorders involve both gut microbiota dysbiosis and systemic metabolic alterations. Therefore, we assessed inflammatory factors, oxidative stress markers, gut microbiota, and plasma metabolites to analyze their interrelationships and explored the potential mechanisms through which PXJ improves metabolism. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preparation of PXJ water extract Pangxiejiao ( Viscum articulatum 2.2 Determination of intragastric infusion dose The selected doses align with traditional human consumption levels of 5–10 g/day ( 16 50 17 2.3 Animals and groups The 32 healthy male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats, aged 6 weeks and weighing between 180 and 200 g, were provided by Spaf-Bio (Beijing, China), with Animal Certificate No. 110324241103856223 and License No. SCXK (Beijing, China) 2024–0001. All animals were housed under standard conditions in the Guangdong Pharmaceutical University Animal Center (SPF environment, temperature 25 ± 2°C, relative humidity 55 ± 10%) and maintained on a 12 h light–dark cycle. Rats were group-housed with four rats per cage. The Animal Ethics Committee of Guang-dong Pharmaceutical University approved the animal care and experimental protocols under the ethical approval number gdpulacspf2022578. After 1 week of feeding with basal diet and distilled water, the rats were stratified and randomly divided into 4 groups ( n Normal control group (CON, basal feed diet and distilled water), HFFD model group (MOD, high-fat diet and fructose solution), PXJ low-dose treatment group (LP, high-fat diet and fructose solution & PXJ 0.5 g/kg/d), PXJ high-dose treatment group (HP, high-fat diet and fructose solution & PXJ 1 g/kg/d). All interventions were delivered daily via oral gavage, with CON group and MOD group animals receiving distilled water. Modeling and PXJ administration were performed simultaneously for a total duration of 10 weeks. 2.4 Animal diets and experimental feeding protocols All rats were allowed free access to food and water. Basal feed diet was obtained from the Guangdong Pharmaceutical University Animal Center. The caloric distribution of the basal diet was as follows: protein 23.07%, fat 11.85%, and carbohydrates 65.08%, with a total energy content of 3.40 kcal/g. The high-fat feed (XTHF45) was obtained from Keda Hengxin Technology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China). The caloric distribution of the high-fat diet was as follows: protein 20.1%, fat 45.1%, and carbohydrates 34.7%, with a total energy content of 4.7 kcal/g. The specific composition of the rat feed is detailed in Supplementary Table S1 18 2.5 Measurement of food intake, water intake, and body weight Food and water intake was monitored daily at fixed times by weighing the pro-vided and remaining amounts. The actual food and water intake per rat was calculated using the same formula for both: Actual intake per rat = (Initial amount - Remaining amount)/Number of rats per cage. Supplies were refreshed daily to maintain hygiene. All rats’ body weight was measured on the experiment’s final day. 2.6 Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) After 10 weeks of feeding, all rats underwent a 12-h fast and were allowed to drink water. A 50% glucose solution (2 g/kg) was administered orally to all rats. Blood glucose levels were determined at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min using a glucose meter and test strips. The blood glucose measurements calculated the area under the glucose tolerance curve (AUC). 2.7 Sample collection At week 10, all rats were fasted overnight and anesthetized with 2% sodium pentobarbital (0.3 mL/100 g body weight). Blood was collected from the abdominal aorta into heparinized and plain vacuum tubes (5 mL each). After 30 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged (3,000 rpm, 10 min), and serum/plasma supernatants were aliquoted for analysis. Organs (liver, kidney, pancreas, colon, and adipose tissue) were immediately harvested. Adipose tissue was fixed in a specialized fixative, while other organs were preserved in general fixative (both from Wuhan Pinofei Biological Technology Co., Ltd., China) and stored at 4°C overnight. Colon contents were rapidly aliquoted into enzymefree cryotubes, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C for further analysis. The samples for gut microbiota analysis and metabolomics testing were collected only once at the endpoint of the intervention. 2.8 Biochemical analyses Serum biochemical parameters were analyzed using commercial kits: FBG, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, SUA, ALT, AST, BUN, and Scr (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China); GHb, FINS, FFA, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF- α HOMA-IR = fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (mIU/L)/22.5 ( 19 ISI = ln [1 / (fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (mIU/L))] ( 20 2.9 Histopathological observation of organs Visceral fat was collected, blotted dry with sterile filter paper, and weighed to obtain wet mass. Body fat percentage was calculated as: Visceral fat mass (g)/Body weight (g) × 100%. Tissues (liver, kidney, pancreas, colon, visceral and subcutaneous fat) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 48 h, then paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 μm) for H&E staining. Liver samples were cryosectioned after liquid nitrogen snap-freezing and stained with Oil Red O (60% isopropanol differentiation, hematoxylin counterstain). All sections were imaged using an Olympus digital microscope. Three random fields were captured for each section at a magnification of 200× and 400×. Regional analysis was conducted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and measured cell area and the number of cells. 2.10 Gut microbiota analysis 2.10.1 DNA detection and PCR product acquisition Genomic DNA was retrieved from fecal samples using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and assessed for purity and concentration via 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA was diluted until the final concentration reached one ng/μL. PCR amplification was performed using primers for the 16 V 34 region (341F,806R; 341F:5’-CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG-3’, 806R:5’-GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT-3’). The PCR reaction mixture included Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix, 0.2 μM primers, and a 10 ng DNA template. The amplified products were purified using magnetic beads, mixed in equal volumes, and subsequently analyzed. 2.10.2 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis Libraries were created by applying the NEB Next® Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit and assessed for quality on the Agilent 5,400 platform. Sequencing was carried out on the NovaSeq 6,000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were processed by merging paired-end reads, trimming barcode and primer sequences with FLASH (Version 1.2.11) ( 21 22 1 23 α 2.11 Metabolomics analysis 2.11.1 Metabolite extraction and LC–MS analysis Plasma samples (100 μL) were combined with ice-cold 80% methanol (v/v) (CAS 67–56-1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and vortexed for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000g for 20 min at 4 °C in a D3024R low-temperature centrifuge (D3024R, Scilogex, USA), the supernatant was diluted to 53% methanol and re-centrifuged to remove impurities. Quality control (QC) samples were produced by mixing equal volumes from each group. LC–MS analysis was performed on a Vanquish UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) coupled to a Q Exactive™ HF hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). Metabolites were separated on a Hypersil Gold C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.9 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using a gradient elution of 0.1% formic acid (CAS 64–18-6, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in water (CAS 7732-18-5, Merck, Germany) and methanol at 0.2 mL/min. ESI-MS detection was carried out in positive and negative modes (m/z 100–1,500) ( 24 2.11.2 Data processing and differential analysis Raw data files were translated into mzXML format using ProteoWizard and manipulated with XCMS for peak detection, alignment, and quantification. Metabolite identification was achieved by matching m/z values, retention times, and MS/MS spectra with high-quality spectral databases, using a mass tolerance of 10 ppm. Background noise was removed by analyzing blank samples, and data normalization was performed using the following formula: (sample peak area/total peak area) × (QC1 peak area / total QC1 peak area). Metabolites with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 30% in QC samples were excluded to ensure data reliability. Differential metabolites were identified based on VIP > 1, p R 2 Q 2 2 2.12 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Normality tests were conducted on the data to verify whether they followed a normal distribution. Continuous variables was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results were analyzed as mean ± standard error of the mean (Mean ± SD) unless stated otherwise. The least significant difference (LSD) post hoc 3 p 3 Results 3.1 PXJ improves metabolic disorders induced by HFFD in rats PXJ significantly improved the weight gain and fat accumulation caused by HFFD in a dose-dependent manner. After 10 weeks of HFFD feeding, the body weight and body fat percentage of the MOD group were significantly higher than those of the CON group ( p p Figures 1A B Figures 1C D Figure 1 PXJ improves HFFD-induced metabolic dysregulation in rats.

Metrics include body weight, body fat ratio, diet and water intake, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin sensitivity, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, cholesterol levels, and serum uric acid. Notable observations are marked with different letters indicating statistical significance. Each graph visually contrasts how each group differs in these health metrics over specified periods or conditions, demonstrating significant variation across the groups. PXJ improved obesity while also reducing serum levels of blood glucose, lipids, and serum uric acid. More specifically, PXJ significantly reduced HFFD-induced hyperglycemia and improved insulin levels.

Microscopic images (E-J) depict liver and intestinal tissues with staining variations under different conditions. Additional bar graphs (K-L) display mean fat area measurements for epididymal and omental fat. Each group shows distinct variations in tissue structure and enzyme levels, indicating different physiological responses among experimental conditions. Metabolic disorders are closely associated with pathological changes in the liver, kidney, pancreas, and intestines. However, directly observing such damage in clinical settings remains challenging. To address this, we investigated the impact of HFFD on the metabolic functions of major organs in rats using multiple pathological techniques. At the termination of the experiment, we observed that the fresh liver in the MOD group appeared pale yellow or yellow-brown ( Figure 2E-1 Figure 2E-2 Figure 2E-3 The kidney is one of the vital metabolic and excretory organs. Compared with the CON group, the MOD group exhibited pathological renal damage characterized by irregular glomerular structure, discontinuous renal tubular epithelial cells, and increased inflammatory cell aggregation ( Figure 2F Figure 2G Figure 2H Adipose tissue is a vital target organ for energy storage and metabolic regulation. From Figures 2I J Figures 2K L p 3.3 PXJ alleviates HFFD-induced free fatty acid accumulation, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress dysregulation Based on changes in metabolic parameters, histopathological observations, and biochemical markers, the mechanisms underlying HFFD-induced metabolic disorders and the protective effects of PXJ intervention were further investigated. After 10 weeks of HFFD feeding, serum FFA levels were significantly increased, while PXJ effectively reduced serum FFA levels ( p Figure 3A α p Figures 3B D Figure 3 PXJ attenuates HFFD-induced inflammatory responses and oxidative stress.

Additionally, elevated MDA and reduced SOD activity were observed in the MOD group serum ( p Figures 3E F 3.4 PXJ altered the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota The impact of PXJ on gut microbiota in HFFD was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing technology.

When administered concomitantly, PXJ effectively reduced various metabolic disturbances, including impaired glucose, lipid homeostasis and serum uric acid dysregulation, while providing organ-protective effects. Notably, correlation network analysis reveals significant interactions among gut microbiota, metabolites, and inflammatory markers, suggesting that PXJ may exert systemic effects associated with the “microbiota-metabolism-cytokines” axis. Through systematic biochemical profiling and histopathological examination, we validated PXJ’s concurrent metabolic-modulating and organ-preserving properties. It is the first to combine 16S rRNA sequencing with untargeted metabolomics to preliminarily elucidate the potential mechanisms of PXJ. These findings offer new evidence for the potential of PXJ as a functional tea beverage that can intervene early in metabolic dysregulation.
