What is more, due to their specific structure, these compounds are attractive components in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Modification of the 1,3-butadiene structure allows obtaining compounds characterized by different reactivity and possessing various biological properties. In order to thoroughly investigate this phenomenon, an analysis of 20 compounds, including 1,3-butadiene and its analogues, was carried out. For this purpose, a study based on MEDT, ADME, and PASS was performed. In this research, changes in electronic properties and basic physicochemical parameters under the presence of various substituents at various positions in the structure of 1,3-butadiene were studied. At the end, the influence of modifications on biological activities for the tested compounds was evaluated. Based on the presented results, it was found that substituent modifications cause significant changes in both electronic structures and in physicochemical properties of all the compounds. This fact is probably caused by the small size of the considered compounds. On the other hand, the main preferences for the most important active sites in the tested molecules remain the same due to the presence of a strongly conjugated system of double bonds. conjugated diene substituent effect electronic reactivity indices physicochemical properties in silico MEDT ADME PASS This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1.

Therefore, this article aims to fill this gap. In continuation of our research of nitro-functionalized analogues of 1,3-butadiene ( 1 38 39 40 1 2a 6d First, it was decided to investigate the effect of a homogeneous substitution by only one type of Electron Donating Group (EDG) or Electron Withdrawing Group (EWG). For this purpose, 16 compounds were evaluated.

Results and Discussion The presented research was divided into two main sections. Firstly, a comprehensive analysis of the reactivity of 1,3-butadiene ( 1 2a 6d 43 1 44 45 46 2.1. Study of Electron Density Distribution Based on MEDT This computational study has been conducted on 1,3-butadiene ( 1 2a 6d 2.1.1. Analysis of the Electronic Structure Based on ELF, NPA, and MEP The ELF is a technique that allows prediction of the likelihood of finding an electron in the neighboring space of a reference electron, at a given point and with the same spin [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 In the ELF analysis, each bond in the molecule is associated with one or more disynaptic basins. Specifically, V (A,B) denotes the disynaptic basin associated with the bond between atoms A and B. In this, V represents the primary disynaptic basin corresponding to the electron density shared between two bonded atoms, while V’ denotes a secondary or complementary basin that also contributes to the same bond, often associated with π or resonance components. The total electron population of the bond, V t t 53 54 1 2a 6d Figure 5 Table 1 In the ELF topology of the model conjugated diene, which is 1,3-butadiene ( 1 Figure 5 Table 1 Figure 5 Table 1 Figure 5 ELF attractor positions (shown as pink spheres) of the core and valence basins, together with the corresponding atom numbers in the butadiene core, for molecules 1 2a 6d The introduction of EDG or EWG terminal monosubstitution to the structure of 1,3-butadiene ( 1 2 5a 2 5a 2a 2d Table 1 1 3a 3a 1 Table 1 2a 4a Table 1 5a Table 1 55 56 57 58 The nature of all tested 1,3-butadiene analogues, substituted in both terminal ( 2 5b 2 5c 2 5a 2 5b 2 5c 1 Table 1 2b 2c 2b Table 1 2c Table 1 5c Table 1 Figure 5 5c The presence of two substituents, located at the same terminal carbon atom, causes significant changes in electron localization. In contrast to the previously discussed examples, compounds ( 2 5d 2 5a 3d 2d 4d 5d Table 1 5d Figure 5 5d The effect of the introduction of two extremely EDGs or EWGs in the form of amino or nitro groups, respectively, in the structures of 1,3-butadiene analogues ( 6b d 6b Table 1 push–pull 59 60 6c Table 1 6d Table 1 5c 5d 6c 6d Figure 5 6c 6d It should be underlined that the presence of monosynaptic basins, located on the nitrogen atom of nitro groups in compounds ( 5c,d 6c,d 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 To sum up the ELF analysis, it can be concluded that despite the differences occurring in the electron populations of all considered compounds, the conjugated π-bond system is preserved in the whole C1-C2-C3-C4 butadiene core. While the ELF topological analysis provides a bonding pattern concordant with the commonly accepted Lewis structure, the NPA represents the reagents’ electronic structure [ 68 69 70 Figure 6 The NPA of the model conjugated diene, which is 1,3-butadiene ( 1 Figure 6 1 Figure 6 The NPA results of terminally monosubstituted analogues of 1,3-butadiene ( 2 5a 2a 5a Figure 6 2a 4a Figure 6 Terminal substitution with two groups of the same type practically does not affect the natural atomic charges in the butadiene core.

Analysis of the CDFT Reactivity Indices CDFT is a very important tool in understanding the reactivity of molecules in various processes. The theory connects well-established chemical concepts, like electronic chemical potential μ and chemical hardness η, as well as chemical softness S, with the electronic structure of a molecule. The presented reactivity descriptors are important due to their ability to quantify the tendency of a molecule to donate or accept electrons and to predict its overall chemical reactivity, which can in turn provide insights into potential biological interactions, such as binding to biomolecules, enzyme reactivity, or participation in redox processes. In particular, the electronic chemical potential informs about the tendency of a molecule to gain or lose electrons, which can influence its interactions with biological targets; chemical hardness indicates the resistance of a molecule to changes in its electron number, reflecting its stability; and chemical softness shows the ease with which a molecule can undergo electronic rearrangements, correlating with its potential reactivity in biological processes, including binding, catalysis, or redox reactions [ 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 The calculation of reactivity descriptors is based on the energy values of the frontal molecular orbitals (MOs) HOMO and LUMO for the compound. It should be noted that the difference in values between the mentioned orbitals alone provides significant information. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap is an important stability index, as it explains the charge transfer interactions within the molecule and is useful in determining molecular electronic transport properties. A molecule with a high frontier orbital (HOMO-LUMO) energy gap has low chemical reactivity and simultaneously high kinetic stability. The phenomenon is related to high excitation energy between the high-lying LUMO and the low-lying HOMO energy levels [ 80 81 82 1 2a 6d Figure 7 The computed HOMO energy [ 83 1 83 1 Figure 7 2 5a 2 5a 5a Figure 7 3a 4a 1 2a Figure 7 1 2a 5a A similar analogy occurs in terminal disubstitution of 1,3-butadiene ( 3 5b 1 5b 5b 2 5b Figure 7 2 5c 2 4c 1 5c 2 5c Figure 7 In the case of geminal terminally disubstituted analogues of 1,3-butadiene ( 2 5d 2 4d 2 4b 5d Figure 7 5d 2 5d 36 5a 5b, 5c 5d The presence of two EDG or EWG in the form of amino as well as nitro groups, respectively, in the structures of 1,3-butadiene analogues 6b d 6b 2b 5b Figure 7 6c 5c Figure 7 6b d 6d Figure 7 Based on HOMO as well as LUMO energies of 1,3-butadiene ( 1 2a 6d Table 2 Figure 8 The calculated global electrophilicity (ω) [ 84 1 85 Figure 8 1 86 87 1 1 2a d Figure 8 2a d 2a d 3a d Figure 8 3a d 1 On the other hand, the introduction of the EDG trifluoromethyl group in compounds 4a–d causes both a noticeable increase of global electrophilicity as well as a reduction of global nucleophilicity compared to other compounds with amine ( 2a d 3a d Figure 8 4a d 4a d 5a d Figure 8 5a d The position of both the amino and nitro groups in compounds 6b–d does not significantly influence the value of the global electronic properties.

Biological Potential Based on ADME and PASS Studies Since 1,3-butadiene ( 1 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 93 94 1 95 96 97 Aydinli 98 Deniz 99 Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus Mycobacterium luteum Candida tenuis Aspergillus niger Durden 100 5b Uromyces phaseoli 5b 100 Moreover, the conjugated system together with EDG and EWG substituents is widely and commonly used as a building block in the synthesis of compounds with biological potential, such as carbazoles, benzoxazolines, benzimidazolines, pyrimidines, imidazolidines, thiazolidinones, pyrazoles, pyrimidines, isothiazoles, dihydroisoxazoles, thiophenes, benzo[h]quinolones, and others [ 101 102 103 104 105 In view of the above, we decided to prepare a simple in silico consideration of possibilities and potential biological applications of 1,3-butadiene ( 1 2a 6d 106 Lipinski 107 Ghose 108 Veber 109 Egan 110 Muegge 111 1 2a 6d 112 2.2.1. Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Properties and Drug-likeness Based on ADME ADME studies play a crucial role in the early stages of drug development. Experimental evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters is often time-consuming and costly. Therefore, to streamline research efforts and optimize resource allocation, computational tools are increasingly employed for predicting ADME characteristics. In this context, key physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity, solubility, pharmacokinetics, and medicinal chemistry friendliness of the investigated compounds were analyzed. The obtained results of mentioned characteristics for 1,3-butadiene ( 1 2a 6d Table 3 1 2a 6d Figure 11 1 2a 6d 113 114 115 Based on physicochemical properties and predicted ADME parameters shown in Table 3 1 2a 6d Lipinski 107 Veber 109 Egan 110 1 2a 6d Table 3 2 2 116 117 1 2a 6d 109 2 110 2 118 119 120 121 1 3a d 4a d 2 Table 3 2 116 117 According to more demanding filters such as those developed by Ghose 108 Muegge 111 1 2a 6d Ghose 108 Muegge 111 1 2a 6d Table 3 122 123 Low molar mass is a direct consequence of an insufficient number of atoms in the molecule.

Materials and Methods All computations were carried out with the Gaussian 16 package [ 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 The electronic structures of 1,3-butadiene and its selected analogues were described by the Electron Localization Function (ELF) [ 49 68 69 70 163 75 76 77 HOMO LUMO μ ≈ (Ε HOMO LUMO (1) η ≈ E HOMO LUMO (2) S ≈ 1/η (3) In turn, the values of global electrophilicity ω (Equation (4)) and global nucleophilicity N (Equation (5)) were calculated according to the formulas: ω = μ 2 (4) N = E HOMO HOMO (TCE) (5) HOMO (TCE) HOMO (TCE) In parallel, electrophilic P k + k − 89 90 k k k + k − 89 90 ω k k + (6) N k k − (7) The physicochemical as well as pharmacokinetic properties were estimated by the SwissADME online server [ 106 Lipinski 107 Ghose 108 Veber 109 Egan 110 111 112 In order to visualize the molecular geometries of all considered structures, including ELF, MEP, and HOMO-LUMO orbitals, as well as 3D representations of the radical anions and radical cations, the GaussView 6.0 software [ 164 106 4. Conclusions and Future Prospective In this study, a comprehensive computational analysis of the reactivity of 1,3-butadiene and its analogues was performed. Additionally, a preliminary assessment of their biological potential, drug-likeness, and likely applications based on ADME and PASS simulations was performed. ELF analysis shows that terminal bonds concentrate populations with weaker double-bond character, while internal bonds concentrate populations stronger than single bonds. Substitution in the C1-C4 core does not qualitatively alter valence basin populations but modifies them quantitatively, most notably for nitro groups. In close proximity, nitro groups induce monosynaptic basins on nitrogen atoms, suggesting potential synthetic utility. Frontier orbital and HOMO–LUMO analyses reveal that substitution generally increases reactivity [ 80 81 82 Global reactivity descriptors classify 1,3-butadiene as both a moderate electrophile and nucleophile. Substitution alters these properties systematically: amino analogues act as marginal electrophiles and strong nucleophiles; methyl analogues as moderate electrophiles and strong nucleophiles; and trifluoromethyl and nitro analogues as strong electrophiles and marginal nucleophiles, with nitro compounds showing more pronounced differences. Among all compounds, 1,4-diamino-1,3-butadiene acts as a super nucleophile, and 1,4-dinitro-1,3-butadiene as a super electrophile, regardless of the second reagent [ 88 Physicochemical descriptors and ADME predictions indicate that neither 1,3-butadiene nor its studied analogues alone are independent promising drug candidates. Their limitations include low molecular weight, low molar refractivity, and excessive unsaturation. Structural modifications are thus necessary. Two development directions can be considered. First, due to low molecular weight and high unsaturation, these molecules are suitable building blocks for synthesizing more complex structures. Substitution across different positions generates diverse electronic properties, enabling rational selection of analogues depending on the reaction partner. Second, more extensive modifications of the butadiene core can enhance drug-likeness. According to Muegge 111 165 166 167 168 Thus, the presented results provide a basis for employing the tested compounds as useful building blocks in the synthesis of more complex molecules. These findings may assist in the design of compounds with biological potential, not only derived from the 1,3-butadiene core but also from other conjugated systems. Additionally, PASS analysis enables identification of prospective application pathways for structures closely related to the tested molecules.
