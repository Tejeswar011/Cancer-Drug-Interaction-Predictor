In this study, we analyze National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to determine the trends of MT including discharge other than home (DOTH) and mortality. Material and methods Healthcare Utilization Program-NIS (HCUP-NIS) was queried between 2005 and 2018 for CVT and MT. Cochran–Armitage test was conducted to assess linear trend of proportion of utilization and DOTH of MT. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to assess odds of undergoing MT among CVT admissions, odds of in-hospital mortality, and DOTH for all admissions involving MT for CVT. Results A total of 1331 (1.56%) admissions involved MT out of 85,370 CVT cases. Utilization of MT had an upward trend of 0.13% ( p p p p p p Conclusion There was an increasing trend of utilization of MT. Proportions of DOTH among MT procedures, however, remained stable. Patients with greater risk factors, including hematological disorders and cerebral edema, were more likely to undergo MT. Among patients treated with MT, those with coma or cerebral edema were more likely to die.
