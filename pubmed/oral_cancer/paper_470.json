The inclusion criteria comprised the following: (1) no use of bismuth preparations, H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 4 weeks prior to endoscopy and (2) no history of gastric or duodenal surgery. Among 54 eligible patients, gastric mucosal biopsy specimens were evaluated using Warthin–Starry (W–S) staining, the rapid urease test (RUT), and the 14C urea breath test (14C-UBT) for group stratification. The patients were classified into the H. pylori n H. pylori n n 2.2 Main reagents and instruments The main reagents and instruments included the following: Gastric H. pylori 2.3 Specimen collection and preservation Fasting venous whole blood samples (3 mL) were collected from the patients in the morning and preserved in EDTA-anticoagulated tubes. Following centrifugation, plasma and blood cells were aseptically separated into enzyme-free EP tubes under sterile conditions. The plasma samples were stored at −80 °C, while blood cells were subjected to lymphocyte isolation using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation, followed by preservation in TRIzol reagent at −80 °C. Gastric mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained from the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum by experienced endoscopists. A portion of each sample was fixed in 10% formalin for paraffin embedding, while the remainder was immediately stored at −80 °C for subsequent experiments. 2.4 Identification of H. pylori The rapid urease test was performed by immediately placing the gastric mucosal biopsy specimens into urea enzyme reaction wells to observe color changes in the liquid medium. For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, the paraffin-embedded gastric mucosal sections underwent sequential processing, including routine dewaxing to hydration, nuclear staining with hematoxylin, cytoplasmic counterstaining with eosin, dehydration, and clearing, followed by mounting for microscopic examination. Warthin–Starry staining of the gastric mucosa involved processing the paraffin sections through standard dewaxing and hydration, followed by incubation with 1% silver nitrate at 60 °C for 45–60 min. The sections were then developed with a silver-gelatin solution at 60 °C for 2–5 min until a brown–black coloration appeared, followed by dehydration, clearing, and final mounting for microscopic evaluation. 2.5 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay The plasma levels of the inflammatory factors TGF-β1, IL-10, and IL-17 were detected using their corresponding kits. The signals were detected using a spectrophotometer at 450 nm, and the ELISACalc software was used to analyze the results. 2.6 Real-time quantitative PCR A total of 100 mg of gastric mucosa tissue was lysed in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and used to extract the total RNA. The RNA was reverse transcribed with the TaqMan reverse transcription reagent to synthesize cDNA. RT-qPCR was performed using an Opticon RT-PCR system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA levels were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method, with GAPDH serving as the internal reference. The primer sequences are shown in Table 1 Table 1 Sequence of the newly designed primers in the study.

After deparaffinization, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, washed with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min, followed by additional PBS washes. The sections were developed with a DAB solution, mounted, and examined microscopically. The ImageJ color deconvolution plugin was used to measure the area fraction (percentage of positive staining area) and integrated density for all sections, with the average optical density (AOD) calculated as the ratio of integrated density to area. Throughout the experiment, identical microscope parameters and illumination conditions were maintained. The AOD values between the groups were expressed as mean ± SD, and intergroup comparisons were performed using independent samples t p 2.8 DIA proteomic analysis Gastric mucosal biopsy samples from the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum were collected from six patients in both the H. pylori H. pylori g t 2 p 2.9 Establish experimental animal models The animal study was approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Guizhou Medical University.

The proteins were involved in biological processes, such as Th cell differentiation, positive regulation of cell differentiation, and T cell immune responses, while cellular components and molecular functions were associated with MHC class II protein complexes and receptor activity ( Figure 3A H. pylori β Figure 3B H. pylori β Figure 3C H. pylori β Table 2 H. pylori β Figure 3 Biological information analysis of differentially expressed proteins.

In this study, we measured the expression levels of Treg and IL-10 using ELISA and found that the peripheral blood levels of IL-10 were significantly higher in the patients with H. pylori Figure 6A H. pylori Figure 6B H. pylori H. pylori Figure 6C Figure 6 Helicobacter pylori (A) (B) (C) n p p p t- Panel A shows a scatter plot of IL-10 levels, indicating higher values in the H. pylori positive group.

Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks. 3.6 Helicobacter pylori The elevated expression of RORγt and Foxp3 mRNA in the gastric mucosa and peripheral blood, as well as the increased expression of Th17 and Treg in the gastric mucosa, of the patients with infectious gastritis indicated that Th17 and Treg responses play crucial roles in antimicrobial immunity during H. pylori H. pylori Figure 7A H. pylori-infected Figure 7B H. pylori H. pylori Figure 7 Helicobacter pylori (A) (B) n p p t Flow cytometry analysis comparing control and model groups for Th17 and Treg cells.
