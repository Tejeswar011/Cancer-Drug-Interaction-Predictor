This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward alopecia among patients with alopecia. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with alopecia at Hebei Medical University Third Hospital between December 2023 and January 2024, using a researcher-developed questionnaire. Stress was analyzed using the perceived stress scale (PSS). Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized pathways between demographic/clinical factors and KAP variables. Results A total of 615 participants initially completed the questionnaire, and 545 valid responses were retained, yielding an effective response rate of 88.62%. The mean PSS and KAP scores were 42.48 ± 5.31 (possible scores of 14–70; 60.69%), 11.29 ± 6.42 (possible scores of 0–28; 40.32%), 32.51 ± 3.82 (possible scores of 10–50; 65.02%), and 26.44 ± 6.07 (possible scores of 10–50; 72.88%), respectively. The SEM showed that knowledge was influenced by hair loss after COVID-19 (β=-0.023, P P P P P P P P P Conclusion Patients with alopecia have poor knowledge, negative attitudes, and proactive practices toward alopecia, which was influenced by their age, COVID-19 infection, changes in hair loss after COVID-19, medications that cause hair loss, polycystic ovary syndrome, and years of alopecia. In addition, since knowledge influences attitude and practice, improving knowledge through educational activities should also improve practice, possibly translating into more benefits for patients.

The inclusion criteria were (1) age between 18 and 60 years, (2) diagnosed with alopecia by physicians, and (3) ability to cooperate to complete the questionnaire. The exclusion criteria were (1) mental disorders, reading disabilities, or other conditions impeding questionnaire completion, or (2) inability to use smartphones and, consequently, inability to complete the questionnaire. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of Hebei Medical University Third Hospital (approval NO: 2023-114-1). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before they completed the questionnaire. Questionnaire design The questionnaire was designed by the investigators based on the 2019 Chinese Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Androgenetic Alopecia released by the Hair Aesthetics Professional Committee of the Chinese Medical Association’s Aesthetic and Plastic Physicians Branch. After design, modifications were made based on the opinions of three dermatology experts and two experts in the field of esthetic medicine. A pilot study was conducted with a small sample size (37 participants), yielding a Cronbach’s α coefficient of 0.939, indicating acceptable internal consistency. The final questionnaire, administered in Chinese (The version that translated into English was attached as an Appendix), comprises four sections: demographic information (gender, age, etc.), knowledge dimension, attitude dimension, and practice dimension. The knowledge dimension comprised 14 items, scored as 2 points for very understanding, 1 point for somewhat understanding, and 0 points for not understanding, with a score range of 0–28. The attitude dimension consisted of 10 questions, using a five-point Likert scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, scored from 5 to 1, with a score range of 10–50. The practice dimension included 11 questions, with 11 being multiple-choice questions analyzed using an upset plot and others using a five-point Likert scale, scored from always to never (5 to 1), with a score range of 10–50. Scores < 70% were considered poor [ 16 The stress levels were measured using the perceived stress scale (PSS), which was proposed by Cohen et al. in 1983 [ 17 18 Questionnaire distribution and quality control Convenience sampling was used in this study. Eligible individuals included patients who either presented to our clinic with alopecia during the study period or were members of a hospital-managed WeChat group specifically established for alopecia patients. A dedicated research team was established specifically for this study, composed of trained clinical staff. During the recruitment process, team members systematically invited eligible patients by distributing a QR code linked to the electronic questionnaire. In the outpatient setting, this was done face-to-face at the time of clinical consultation. For the online group, the QR code and study explanation were posted in the WeChat group. In both recruitment channels, the research team provided a standardized verbal or written explanation of the study’s purpose, procedures, and voluntary nature. A given IP address could be used to submit a questionnaire only once. All questions were mandatory to submit a questionnaire. The research team rigorously examined all submissions for completeness, internal consistency, and logical coherence. Investigators were well-versed in understanding the research questions and the survey process, which enhanced data accuracy and consistency. Questionnaires exhibiting logical errors, incomplete responses, or uniform answers across all items were categorized as invalid. Sample size calculation The sample size was calculated using the formula for cross-sectional studies: α = 0.05, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:\\text{n}={\\left(\\frac{{Z}_{1-\\alpha\\:/2}}{\\delta\\:}\\right)}^{2}\\times\\:p\\times\\:\\left(1-p\\right)$$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{Z}_{1-\\alpha\\:/2}$$\\end{document} p Statistical analysis All the analyses were planned a priori. SPSS 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and AMOS 24.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA were used for analysis. The continuous data were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The continuous data were presented as means ± standard deviations (SD). If they conformed to a normal distribution, the comparisons were performed using Student’s t-test (two levels) or ANOVA (more than two levels). The categorical data were presented as n (%) and analyzed using the chi-squared test. Correlations between KAP dimensions were analyzed using Pearson’s analysis. Only those variables that showed statistically significant associations in univariate analyses were incorporated into the model to ensure meaningful and parsimonious structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM tested the hypotheses that hair loss after COVID-19, age, taking medications that cause hair loss influences knowledge, knowledge influences attitude, attitude, knowledge, a history of COVID-19 or not, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), years of hair loss influences practice. Two rounds of SEM fitting were carried out. In the first fitting result, variables without statistical significance were removed, and another round of fitting was carried out. Two-sided P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

The SEM showed knowledge influences attitude and practice. The results may help design educational interventions that could translate into better patient outcomes. The exact pathogenesis of alopecia is unknown, but it is likely due to a multifactorial genetic predisposition triggered by environmental factors [ 1 2 19 The present study revealed poor knowledge and attitude toward alopecia but practice was better, suggesting that the patients perform specific actions out of habit or following instructions without understanding why. Although few studies specifically examined the comprehensive KAP toward alopecia, a study reported that patients with alopecia in Iran had poor knowledge of their disease [ 10 20 15 11 13 14 The SEM analysis revealed that knowledge influenced attitude and practice (both directly and indirectly) and that attitude influenced practice. Hence, designing and implementing educational interventions to improve knowledge should also improve attitudes and practices toward alopecia. Specifically, knowledge about normal hair loss, causes of hair loss, lifestyle habits affecting hair loss, medications causing hair loss, and management of hair loss should be emphasized. Of note, a KAP study of general practitioners in Saudi Arabia revealed a poor knowledge of alopecia [ 12 21 22 23 The SEM analysis also showed that hair loss after COVID-19, age, and taking medication that causes hair loss were negatively associated with knowledge of alopecia. COVID-19 itself does not cause hair loss, but telogen effluvium (i.e., hair loss due to stressful events) has been reported in patients after COVID-19 [ 24 19 25 This study has limitations. The participants were from a single center using convenience sampling, limiting the generalizability of the results to a single geographical area. The cross-sectional nature of the study allowed the determination of KAP at a single point in time. Whether the KAP will change in time remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the present study could serve as a historical baseline to examine the effect of educational interventions. In addition, causality cannot be determined using cross-sectional studies. The SEM analyses can provide a surrogate of causality, but it must be remembered that the causality is statistically inferred instead of being observed [ 26 28 29 30 In conclusion, patients with alopecia have poor knowledge, negative attitudes, and proactive practices toward alopecia. Since knowledge influences attitude and practice, as shown by the SEM, improving knowledge through educational activities should also improve practice, possibly translating into better patient outcomes. Future studies could examine the effect of such interventions. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.  Supplementary Material 2.
