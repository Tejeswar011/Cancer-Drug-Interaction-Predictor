Vitiligo is an acquired depigmenting skin disorder that significantly impacts the physical and mental health of patients, primarily characterized by the loss of epidermal melanocytes, leading to white patches on the skin and mucous membranes. The pathogenesis of vitiligo is complex, with oxidative stress, immune imbalance, and the interaction between these two factors playing a key role. Current treatment strategies mainly focus on alleviating oxidative stress to regulate immune responses, thereby inhibiting the excessive immune activation that damages melanocytes, with drug interventions being the primary approach. However, due to the barrier effect of the skin's stratum corneum, the therapeutic outcomes of these treatments remain suboptimal. The introduction of novel nanoparticle drug delivery systems has revolutionized local treatments for vitiligo, enhancing both the efficacy and safety of drugs and offering new possibilities for personalized and precision treatments. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in the understanding of vitiligo's pathogenesis, treatment strategies, and the role of nanoparticle-based therapies, with a focus on lipid-based and polymeric nanoparticle drug delivery systems, nanoemulsions, microemulsions, hydrogels, and microneedles. These studies emphasize improving treatment outcomes for vitiligo by enhancing drug loading efficiency, improving skin penetration, and increasing local drug concentration, providing theoretical support for further research into vitiligo's pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic agents.

It affects approximately 0.5-2% of the global population, with an increasing incidence each year ( Domaszewska-Szostek et al., 2023 Ezzedine et al., 2021 Bhange et al., 2025 Rodrigues et al., 2017 Ting and Ng, 2023 The exact pathogenesis of vitiligo is still unclear, and ongoing research focuses on genetic mutations, environmental factors, oxidative stress, immune responses, and neurohypotheses. The detailed molecular mechanisms require further investigation ( Yamaguchi et al., 2024a Seidel and Böhm, 2025 Frisoli et al., 2020a Białczyk et al., 2023 Chang and Ko, 2023 Post et al., 2023 Due to the unclear etiology and complex pathogenesis of vitiligo, it remains an easy-to-diagnose but difficult-to-treat disease. The primary treatment goals are to control progression and promote repigmentation. Current therapies include systemic drug treatments, topical therapies, targeted therapies, phototherapy, surgical transplantation, and psychological interventions ( Karagaiah et al., 2020 Seneschal et al., 2023 Jafarzadeh et al., 2024 Chang and Guo, 2022 Inoue et al., 2024a Goldstein et al., 2025 2 Mendes et al., 2022 Drug therapy plays a critical role in the treatment of vitiligo and has shown significant clinical efficacy, but it is currently facing substantial challenges. Vitiligo often requires long-term or even lifelong medication. While systemic drug therapies are effective, they can cause significant adverse effects, particularly corticosteroids, leading to reduced patient tolerance and compliance. Topical treatments are the most commonly used in clinical practice and have fewer side effects compared to systemic therapies. However, the barrier function of the skin’s stratum corneum makes it difficult for most drugs to efficiently accumulate at the lesion site and exert their effects, which limits the effectiveness of traditional creams and ointments. Overcoming this stratum corneum barrier is a major challenge for topical drug therapies ( Liu et al., 2010 Raszewska-Famielec and Flieger, 2022 Qadir et al., 2022 Sun et al., 2020 2 Pathogenesis of vitiligo 2.1 Influence of genetic factors Genetics is considered a key endogenous factor in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. With the advancement of genome-wide studies on vitiligo, at least 40 susceptibility genes have been linked to its onset, including MC1R, TYR, CD44, CD80, HLA-A, and others. Most of these susceptibility genes are involved in immune regulation and immune cell function, indicating that immune dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo ( Said-Fernandez et al., 2021 Awad et al., 2021 Baldini et al., 2017 2.2 Cellular immunity disorder Innate immunity may play a triggering role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Oxidative stress is generally considered the main mediator of immune system and cellular dysfunction ( Boniface et al., 2021 D'Osualdo and Reed, 2012 In contrast, adaptive immunity acts as an amplifier in the induction of vitiligo. It is characterized by the ability to produce antigen-specific responses and memory ( Faraj et al., 2022 + Xu et al., 2022a + + + + Shah et al., 2024 Zhang et al., 2021a Bhardwaj et al., 2020 Singh et al., 2016 Immune imbalance in vitiligo is not only linked to the overactivation of CD8 + + + Carbone et al., 2023 + Zhang et al., 2019 + + + Liu et al., 2024a + + Wu et al., 2024 + Li et al., 2017a + Zou et al., 2022 + Chen et al., 2023a Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are non-migratory cells that reside within tissues and mediate strong immune defenses. However, their abnormal activation can contribute to the development of disease ( Riding and Harris, 2019 + + Shah et al., 2021 Chen et al., 2019a + 2.3 Hydroimmune disorder In addition to cellular immunity, humoral immunity plays a role in the onset and progression of vitiligo by affecting melanocyte numbers and tyrosinase activity. It has been shown that several vitiligo-related autoantigens are present in the serum or skin lesions of vitiligo patients, including tyrosinase hydroxylase, tyrosinase antigen, tyrosine-related proteins (TRP1 and TRP2), melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), melanoma-associated antigen 1, pre-melanosomal protein 17, and melanocyte transcription factor SOX10 ( Xie et al., 2016 Li et al., 2016 Rodríguez-Martín et al., 2012 + + Palermo et al., 2001 2.4 Abnormal cytokine secretion Cytokines are small molecules, including peptides and glycoproteins, that are synthesized and secreted by various tissue cells. They play a key role in regulating immune responses, immune cell differentiation, and inflammatory reactions, and are crucial in mediating melanocyte-specific immune damage. IFN-γ is a multifunctional cytokine primarily secreted by activated T cells and NK cells, with roles in promoting macrophage activation, enhancing antigen presentation, and activating innate immunity. Research indicates that IFN-γ gene expression, mRNA levels, and serum concentrations are elevated in vitiligo patients and are positively correlated with disease activity. IFN-γ binds to interferon receptors on keratinocytes, activating the downstream JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This leads to the secretion of large amounts of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 from keratinocytes. These chemokines bind to the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on CD8+ T cells, recruiting them to the dermal-epidermal junction. Activated CXCR3 + + + Xie et al., 2023 + Craiglow and King, 2015 Liu et al., 2024b TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays roles in tissue repair, regulating inflammation, and enhancing NK cell activity. It is closely related to several autoimmune diseases. Studies have found that TNF-α expression is significantly elevated in the peripheral blood and skin lesions of vitiligo patients, and it participates in melanocyte destruction through multiple pathways ( Dutta et al., 2024 Singh et al., 2021 + Interleukins are cytokines produced by various cells and play an essential role in immune cell maturation, activation, and proliferation. Research has shown that IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 levels are elevated in the serum of vitiligo patients compared to healthy individuals, particularly IL-17 ( Lee et al., 2023 Karagün and Baysak, 2020 Su et al., 2023 Chemokines are crucial for immune cell homing and can direct immune cells to target organs to perform immune functions. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which negatively regulate immune responses, play a key role in maintaining immune balance, and their dysfunction or reduced numbers are closely linked to autoimmune diseases. Studies show that the loss of Treg function is highly associated with vitiligo onset ( Giri et al., 2022 Eby et al., 2015 + + + Li et al., 2017b 2.5 Oxidative stress damage Oxidative stress is a disorder of redox homeostasis caused by an imbalance between oxidative and antioxidative systems, leading to melanocyte dysfunction and damage, which subsequently triggers autoimmune responses and melanocyte destruction. This process plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo ( Yu et al., 2024 Wang et al., 2024a Kang et al., 2018 Xie et al., 2024 Chang et al., 2017 Jian et al., 2016 It is currently widely accepted that oxidative stress plays a crucial initiating role in the development and progression of vitiligo, while autoimmune imbalance is a key factor leading to melanocyte damage. Therefore, understanding the connection and mechanisms between oxidative stress and immune imbalance is a significant scientific question that needs to be addressed in vitiligo pathogenesis research.Beyond directly causing oxidative damage to melanocytes, oxidative stress can also mediate their involvement in the autoimmune response in vitiligo. Studies have shown that under oxidative stress, calreticulin, primarily found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), can translocate from the ER to the melanocyte membrane surface and release HSP70i. HSP70i then binds to PRRs on dendritic cells (DCs), promoting their activation. These activated DCs can, in turn, activate CD8 + Zhang et al., 2014 + Bertolotti et al., 2014 Mosenson et al., 2013 Mosenson et al., 2013 Zhang et al., 2021b Gebhardt et al., 2009 + van den Boorn et al., 2011 + + Li et al., 2017c + Rashighi et al., 2014a + + Chen et al., 2019b + Becatti et al., 2010 2.6 Abnormalities of melanocyte function Melanocyte loss plays a central role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. In addition to immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, intrinsic defects in melanocytes themselves are also critical factors in their loss ( Srivastava et al., 2023 Yi et al., 2019 Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanin synthesis, and its reduced activity leads to insufficient melanin production, causing localized depigmentation and the development of vitiligo ( Monib et al., 2022 Niu and Aisa, 2017 Yamamoto et al., 2020 Melanocyte stem cells have unlimited self-renewal potential. Under certain conditions, such as wound healing, exposure to genotoxic drugs, or UV radiation, tissues or cells regenerate to repair the damaged areas by recruiting stem cells that differentiate into mature melanocytes ( Yang et al., 2023 Huang et al., 2024a Lin et al., 2023 2.7 Abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and function Mitochondria are essential for cellular aerobic respiration and energy metabolism. They play key roles in regulating cell functions, initiating inflammation, mediating signal transduction, maintaining intracellular redox balance, and controlling cell death patterns. Studies show that changes in mitochondrial structure and function are critical at various stages of vitiligo development. Transmission electron microscopy of mitochondria in vitiligo patients reveals significant morphological and functional differences in melanocytes, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, and monocytes. These include increased volume density, irregular swelling, blurred cristae, vacuolization, disordered arrangement, and even fragmentation ( Kaushik et al., 2023 Lin et al., 2024 Golubnitschaja et al., 2025 2+ 2.8 Intestinal Flora Dysbiosis The gut microbiota plays a critical role in metabolism, energy absorption, and immune regulation. When gut dysbiosis occurs, it can mediate the onset of various diseases through the gut-liver, gut-brain, and gut-skin axes. Recent metagenomic sequencing studies have revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota of vitiligo patients compared to healthy individuals. In comparison to healthy people, vitiligo patients have significantly reduced gut microbiota diversity, with alterations in the relative abundance of microbes and changes in their gene and metabolic functions ( Dellacecca et al., 2020 Bzioueche et al., 2021 The gut microbiota and the large number of immune cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue influence the body in various ways. Microbial metabolites, immune responses mediated by microorganisms, and the gut-skin axis, all play significant roles in various diseases, especially skin-related diseases ( Nigro et al., 2025 Xiao et al., 2023 Schiweck et al., 2022 Trompette et al., 2022 2.9 Aberrant expression of miRNA miRNA plays a crucial role in regulating biological growth and development. It is involved in processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumor invasion and metastasis. Additionally, miRNAs can serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of various diseases. In vitiligo, miRNAs are essential in disease onset and progression, and abnormal expression of miRNAs in serum and lesional tissues has become a research hotspot ( Yu et al., 2022 Aguennouz et al., 2021 Exosomes are vesicles with strong cargo and delivery capabilities, capable of carrying proteins, DNA, RNA, and organelles to facilitate long-distance communication between cells and participate in regulating various physiological and pathological processes ( Zhu et al., 2019 Li et al., 2024a + + Zhao et al., 2020 Cui et al., 2024 Li et al., 2022 Figure 1 Figure 1 Summary of typical pathogenesis of vitiligo Figure 1 3 Vitiligo Treatment Once diagnosed, the treatment of vitiligo primarily focuses on three key areas: First, rapidly controlling continuous damage to melanocytes, halting disease progression, and maintaining the disease in a stable phase; second, increasing melanocyte quantity and quality to promote repigmentation in the affected areas; third, inhibiting the activation of tissue-resident memory T cells to delay or prevent vitiligo recurrence. Currently, there are several treatment options for vitiligo, including systemic drug treatment, topical treatments, targeted therapy, biological therapy, phototherapy, and surgical treatment. To enhance treatment effectiveness, sequential or combination therapies are often used.

The most commonly used systemic treatments for vitiligo include glucocorticoids, methotrexate, minocycline, and azathioprine. These drugs usually contain multiple dosage forms, but the dosage forms used clinically to treat vitiligo are mainly tablets and capsules, which have the advantages of convenient administration and good patient compliance. Glucocorticoids are the primary systemic treatment for vitiligo. They suppress leukocyte accumulation, immune activation, cytokine production, and lymphocyte activity, while also lowering immunoglobulin and complement levels. Additionally, glucocorticoids can directly stimulate melanocytes to produce melanin and inhibit melanocyte destruction by suppressing melanocyte-specific antibodies. Common glucocorticoids used for vitiligo treatment include halomethasone, clobetasol propionate, and soft steroids ( Jawade et al., 2023a Yokoi et al., 2023 Speeckaert and Geel, 2023 Parsad and Kanwar, 2010 Charoenpongpun et al., 2022 Jawade et al., 2023b 3.2 Topical topical medication Topical drug treatment for vitiligo is highly targeted, convenient, and cost-effective, but it also has limitations, including long treatment cycles, high recurrence rates, and strong skin irritation. It is often combined with other therapies. Commonly used topical treatments include glucocorticoids, vitamin D derivatives, and calcineurin inhibitors. The dosage forms of these drugs are generally simple ointments and creams due to the precise mechanism of action and efficacy of these drugs, as well as controllable adverse reactions, such as halometasone cream, tacrolimus cream, pimecrolimus cream, calcipotriol betamethasone cream, calcipotriol cream, mometasone furoate cream, sirolimus cream, etc. The prescriptions for preparing ointment mostly include commonly used materials such as mineral oil, Vaseline, liquid paraffin, and propylene carbonate due to factors such as drug loading capacity, stability, biocompatibility, stratum corneum permeability, and skin retention ability of the formulation; While the prescriptions of the cream mainly include base materials and emulsifiers such as benzyl alcohol, hexadecanol, citric acid, monoglycerides, oleyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sodium octadecyl sulfate, sodium hydroxide, octadecyl alcohol, triglycerides, white Vaseline, and polysorbate 80. There are certain differences in the formation mechanism between cream and ointment. Cream often needs to form a stable emulsion system under the action of emulsifiers, while ointment mainly relies on the physical properties of the matrix to form semi-solid formulations, but the differences in preparation methods are not significant. According to the properties and stability of drugs, creams and ointments are often prepared using the blending method, melting method, and emulsification method, with emulsification being the main method. In addition to their systemic use, glucocorticoids are widely recommended as the first-line treatment for vitiligo by various guidelines and expert consensus. Corticosteroids are used topically in the treatment of all types of vitiligo, especially for patients with lesions covering less than 3% of the body, where they serve as first-line treatment for localized vitiligo ( Renert-Yuval et al., 2024 Al-Smadi et al., 2023 Kumaran et al., 2006 Xing and Xu, 2012 Arora et al., 2020 Ebrahim et al., 2021a 3.3 Targeted drug therapy 3.3.1 JAK inhibitor The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is crucial in the development of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and is involved in the physiological and pathological processes of immune-inflammatory cells. It is regulated by various cytokines, including interferons, interleukins, growth hormones, and platelet-derived growth factors. Among these, the IFN-γ-JAK-STAT pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, and cytotoxic CD8 + Qi et al., 2021 Inoue et al., 2024b + Craiglow and King, 2015 Mobasher et al., 2020 Olamiju and Craiglow, 2020 NCT05247489 NCT04530344 NCT04822584 NCT03715829 NCT06118411 NCT05583526 3.3.2 Treg cell therapy Treg cells are key regulators of immune balance, and a decrease in their number and function is a significant factor in the onset of autoimmune diseases. Studies have shown that vitiligo patients have a significant reduction in the number of Treg cells in both the lesions and the periphery, along with a weakened ability to migrate to the skin. This leads to reduced or even lost immunosuppressive function against CD8 + Jin et al., 2024 Bluestone et al., 2023 Chatterjee et al., 2014 + Fritsche et al., 2020 + Műzes and Sipos, 2023 Treg cell therapy holds immense potential for treating autoimmune diseases and organ transplant rejection. However, the stability of Treg cells has consistently been a critical factor limiting their clinical application. Currently, cell culture conditions for cell therapies aim to optimize all cells, which can inadvertently mask unstable cells. These unstable Treg cells can sometimes transform into pro-inflammatory effector T cells. Such converted effector T cells not only exert pro-inflammatory functions but also recognize the body's own cells, posing a significant risk to the very systems they are meant to protect ( Henschel et al., 2023 Arjomandnejad et al., 2022 Junius et al., 2021 Cochrane et al., 2024 3.3.3 Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) Inhibitors PDE4 is an intracellular enzyme that is overexpressed in many inflammatory diseases. Inhibiting PDE4 activity increases intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-23, IL-17, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, while boosting the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10. This helps to slow the rapid progression of vitiligo ( Goldstein et al., 2025 Yazdanian et al., 2021 Pourriyahi et al., 2024 Tam et al., 2021 Sun et al., 2023 2 2 Chen et al., 2023b 3.3.4 Drugs that suppress T-cell immunity  T- cell-related cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, and TNF-α, as well as Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-β) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-23), are abnormally expressed in the serum of vitiligo patients. Regulating Th cell differentiation through targeting these cytokines may be a potential strategy for treating vitiligo ( Tokura et al., 2021 Relapse is a major challenge in curing vitiligo. Studies have shown that vitiligo has a high relapse rate, and some patients may require long-term or even lifelong treatment. Relapse is primarily associated with tissue-resident memory T cells in the lesions, which recruit and activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes by releasing IFN-γ and persist in the lesions even after disease control. IL-15 plays a crucial role in the formation of tissue-resident memory T cells through its chemotactic effects and is essential for the survival, proliferation, and function of various immune cells. Inhibiting IL-15 with suitable antibodies or small molecule inhibitors may eliminate melanocyte-specific tissue-resident memory T cells ( Liu et al., 2025 Richmond et al., 2018 Zhou et al., 2018 + - + + Cheuk et al., 2017 Ng et al., 2023 Frisoli et al., 2020b Rashighi et al., 2014b + Richmond et al., 2017 Papp et al., 2017 3.3.5 Treatment to increase melanocyte stem cell activity Melanocyte stem cells possess indefinite self-renewal capacity. Under appropriate stimuli, such as skin injury, depilation, ultraviolet exposure, and ionizing radiation, melanocytes or damaged tissues can regenerate to repair the damaged areas by recruiting stem cells to differentiate into mature melanocytes, thus inhibiting the progression of pigmentary skin diseases ( Huang et al., 2024b Yardman-Frank and Fisher, 2021 Perez-Bootello et al., 2023 Polańska et al., 2024 3.3.6 Antioxidant stress therapy In the process of melanin synthesis after ultraviolet exposure or inflammation, melanocytes can produce excessive ROS, which attack melanocytes, disrupting their normal proliferation, metabolism, and differentiation, and triggering immune responses and apoptosis, leading to localized or systemic skin depigmentation. As research progresses, numerous antioxidant stress signaling pathways involved in vitiligo pathogenesis have been identified, leading to the development of several novel targeted antioxidants to reduce oxidative stress in vitiligo patients. The Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway plays a crucial role in protecting melanocytes from oxidative stress and can also regulate anti-inflammatory gene expression and inhibit inflammation ( Qiu et al., 2014 Lin et al., 2020 Hasan et al., 2021 Shaker et al., 2022 Chen et al., 2024a Xu et al., 2022b Niu et al., 2016 Lin et al., 2023 Tang et al., 2018 Chen et al., 2024b Li et al., 2024b Chauhan et al., 2024 Wusiman et al., 2025 3.3.7 Phototherapy Phototherapy is one of the most effective treatments for vitiligo, including photochemotherapy, narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) irradiation, 308 nm excimer laser, and CO 2 Zubair and Hamzavi, 2020 Xiao et al., 2015 + Gauthier et al., 2021 Sun et al., 2015 Suo et al., 2024 Liu and Chen, 2023 2 Hu et al., 2019 2 Mansouri et al., 2024 Yu et al., 2019 3.4 Surgical treatment For stable or refractory vitiligo, surgical treatment is considered both safe and effective, particularly for patients with vitiligo in specific areas or those with difficult-to-treat cases ( Frączek et al., 2022 + + Refat et al., 2023 Yousif et al., 2023 Figure 3 Figure 3 Targeted therapy and emerging therapeutic approaches based on the pathogenesis of vitiligo.

The stratum corneum of the epidermis serves as the primary barrier to molecular diffusion in the skin and is recognized as a heterogeneous dual-chamber system. The basal layer is closely connected to the dermis and contains melanocytes, whose melanin production determines the skin's color. In general, the main route for drug absorption through the skin is by passing through the stratum corneum to reach the basal layer, where it exerts local effects, or into the dermis, where it is absorbed by capillaries and enters the bloodstream. Absorption via hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands is minimal. The stratum corneum cell membrane is not a lipid bilayer but a densely cross-linked protein mesh, making substance diffusion difficult ( Bäsler et al., 2016 Parhi et al., 2015 Phatale et al., 2022 3.5.2 Low drug concentration in vitiligo lesions Vitiligo treatment involves both systemic and topical therapies. Systemic treatment can halt the progression of vitiligo and lead to repigmentation in many patients. However, to achieve higher drug concentrations at the affected areas and enhance efficacy, large doses and prolonged treatment durations are often required, leading to significant side effects, especially with corticosteroids, which can cause serious adverse effects. As a result, topical treatments have become the most commonly used approach for treating vitiligo. Most topical treatments are designed to have local effects, rather than systemic absorption. These treatments not only improve efficacy but also avoid systemic toxicity. For these treatments to be effective, the formulation must remain in the stratum corneum long enough for the drug to penetrate the deeper layers of the epidermis through hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and other appendages. However, some topical preparations fail to stay on the affected skin for long periods and do not integrate well with the stratum corneum, preventing the drug from accumulating in the stratum corneum as a \"drug reservoir,\" which reduces its penetration into the basal and spinous layers of the epidermis, ultimately lowering efficacy ( Aralelimath et al., 2024 3.5.3 High recurrence rate of vitiligo Vitiligo is a disease characterized by a high relapse rate within a short period. Studies show that the relapse rate is nearly 60% within two years, and up to 40% after two years, meaning that vitiligo tends to relapse after treatment and is difficult to cure, presenting a major clinical challenge that needs to be addressed ( Oh et al., 2021 Xu et al., 2023 3.5.4 Treatment strategies need to be optimised and innovated The pathogenesis of vitiligo is highly complex, involving genetic mutations, oxidative stress, immune imbalance, and melanocyte death, which presents significant challenges for treatment. First, vitiligo displays considerable heterogeneity, with varying disease manifestations, severity, and progression rates across patients, making it difficult to develop effective treatment plans. Currently, precise, individualized treatment plans are lacking ( Liu et al., 2024c Yamaguchi et al., 2024b Figure 4 Figure 4 The induction and summary fo challenges in the treatment of vitiligo (Prepared by the authors using https://www.biorender.com Figure 4 3.6 Nano drug delivery system in vitiligo treatment The nanodrug delivery system refers to a nanocarrier-based system designed to encapsulate drugs, improving their bioavailability, targeting, and efficacy while reducing adverse reactions. Nanodrug delivery systems have shown great promise and widespread application in the treatment of skin diseases. These systems offer numerous advantages: (1) By reducing drug particle size, improving drug lipophilicity, and utilizing skin appendages, nanodrug delivery systems enhance transdermal drug absorption. For example, liposomal hydrogels, nanoneedles, and nanoemulsions have been shown to significantly improve drug absorption through the skin; (2) Nanodrug delivery systems can specifically target and deliver drugs to affected tissues, improving efficacy and minimizing side effects. Targeted drug delivery can be passive or active. Passive targeting utilizes the inherent properties of nanocarriers, such as their high permeability or the use of microneedles, to deliver drugs precisely to skin lesions. Active targeting involves modifying nanocarriers with ligands or using microenvironment-responsive carriers, allowing drugs to be released intelligently by binding to specific receptors on lesion cells. This targeted delivery approach offers significant advantages in treating persistent skin diseases such as psoriasis, vitiligo, and eczema; (3) Nanodrug delivery systems can extend the drug’s residence time at skin lesion sites by leveraging the adhesion, controlled release properties, and high permeability of nanocarriers, thus enhancing treatment efficacy. For instance, nanocarriers such as nanopatches, nanoneedles, and gels have been shown to extend the local retention time of drugs; (4) By encapsulating drugs in nanocarriers, nanodrug delivery systems minimize direct contact between the drug and the skin, reducing skin irritation while also protecting the drug from degradation, which improves the stability of sensitive drugs. For example, liposomes and nanoemulsions can reduce drug irritation, while nanoparticles can prevent degradation or oxidation; (5) Nanodrug delivery systems enable the delivery of drugs to deeper skin layers, allowing treatment of conditions that traditional drugs cannot reach. Additionally, these systems can deliver drugs to sebaceous glands or hair follicles, thus broadening the scope of skin disease treatments. In summary, nanodrug delivery systems offer vast potential in skin disease treatment, enhancing drug absorption, targeted delivery, and treatment effectiveness, while minimizing side effects and improving patient adherence and compliance. Figure 5 Figure 5 Summary of the main challenges in the treatment of vitiligo and the main types and advantages of new drug delivery systems. Figure 5 3.7 Lipid-based nanodrug delivery systems The lipid-based nanodrug delivery system is widely used in the treatment of skin diseases, primarily including lipid nanocapsules and lipid nanoparticles. These systems can damage the lipid bilayer structure to disrupt the integrity of the skin’s stratum corneum barrier, thereby improving the distribution of therapeutic drugs in the epidermis and promoting transdermal drug absorption ( Liu et al., 2019 Lee et al., 2022 He et al., 2005 Doppalapudi et al., 2017a Garg et al., 2016a Lipid nanoparticles are nano-carriers made by mixing drugs, liquid lipids, solid lipids, surfactants, and other components, with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm. These primarily include solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers ( Pinto et al., 2022 Souza et al., 2020 Eroğlu et al., 2023 Chuang et al., 2018 Katari and SJain S., 2021 Gomi et al., 2023 Waghule et al., 2020 Ghosh et al., 2023 Ashtiani et al., 2021 Table 2 Table 2 Lipid-based nanodelivery systems for the treatment of vitiligo Table 2 Formulation Carriers Targets Drug Results References Ultradeformable liposomes Cholesterol Stimulaten melanin and reduction of oxidative stress Psoralen Significant stimulation of melanin and tyrosinase activity, also effectively scavenges free radicals.

( Garg et al., 2016b Hyalurosomes Lipoid® S100 Antioxidant Berberine Nanovesicles fixed with hyaluronic acid enhance drug loading capacity; hyalurosomes show better efficacy in a vitiligo mouse model, with significant biological markers and minimal adverse reactions.

( Saxena et al., 2023 3.8 Polymer-based nanodrug delivery systems Polymer-based nanodrug delivery systems are colloidal particles made from polymers, mainly including polymer nanoparticles and polymer micelles, with particle sizes typically ranging from 10 to 1000 nm. These systems offer advantages such as high encapsulation efficiency, good modifiability, and controlled drug release, and they are widely applied in cancer treatment. In recent years, there has been increasing research and application of polymer-based nanodrug delivery systems in the treatment of skin diseases, particularly biodegradable polymers. For example, Zhang et al. synthesized nanoparticles containing rapamycin and the vitiligo self-antigen HEL46-61 (NPHEL46-61/Rapa) using PLGA and PLA-PEG, and studied their effects on regulatory T cells and vitiligo ( Zhang et al., 2021c + Khan et al., 2021 Kováčik et al., 2020 Amjadi et al., 2017 Fereig et al., 2021 Hwang et al., 2020 Guyader et al., 2022 Lapteva et al., 2014 Rao et al., 2023 Kandekar et al., 2019 3.9 Nano and micro emulsions Nanoemulsions and microemulsions are both thermodynamically stable dispersion systems formed by mixing specific proportions of water, oil, surfactants, and co-surfactants. The primary difference between nanoemulsions and microemulsions lies in their particle size: nanoemulsions have particle sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm, while microemulsions have slightly larger particles. In recent years, both nanoemulsions and microemulsions have found widespread applications in the treatment of skin diseases, primarily because they can directly act on the skin surface and penetrate into deeper layers through the skin’s small pores, significantly enhancing the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of drugs, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear ( Anand et al., 2019 Souto et al., 2022 Patel et al., 2013 Ozkan et al., 2022 3.10 Hydrogel Hydrogels are a new type of hydrophilic polymeric gel system formed by hydrophilic polymers through physical or chemical crosslinking, which creates a three-dimensional network structure. Due to their high water absorption and retention, excellent biocompatibility, tunable physicochemical properties, stimulus responsiveness (such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, humidity, light, etc.), good mechanical properties, and biodegradability, hydrogels have been widely applied in fields such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food ( Cao et al., 2021 Sharma and Tiwari, 2020 Chen et al., 2023c Liang et al., 2023 Zhu et al., 2023 3.11 Microneedle Although the skin is an excellent route for drug delivery, the barrier function of the stratum corneum means that very few therapeutic drugs can naturally penetrate the skin, resulting in reduced bioavailability and ultimately suboptimal therapeutic effects. To address this, researchers have employed chemical permeation enhancers and physical methods to open skin channels, such as sonophoresis, laser ablation, iontophoresis, and chemical enhancers, to reduce the skin barrier resistance and increase skin permeability. Although these methods can improve drug delivery through the skin, skin irritation to some extent limits their widespread use in medicine.Microneedle therapy utilizes fine needle-like devices to create numerous microchannels in the epidermis. As an efficient, painless, and convenient method for transdermal drug delivery, microneedle therapy can effectively overcome the bottleneck of drug permeation through the skin and has been widely applied in areas such as pigmentary skin diseases, hair loss, acne, scars, and facial rejuvenation ( Qu et al., 2022 Yang et al., 2021 Al-Japairai et al., 2020 Li et al., 2025 Ebrahim et al. included 60 patients with non-segmental stable vitiligo, randomly dividing them into three groups: blank microneedle treatment, tacrolimus ointment, and tacrolimus microneedle combination therapy, with a treatment cycle of 6 months. The microneedle treatment frequency was once every two weeks, and tacrolimus was applied twice daily ( Ebrahim et al., 2021b Abdou et al., 2022 Nofal et al., 2022 Khater et al., 2020 Nilforoushzadeh et al., 2022 Qu et al., 2022 Waghule et al., 2019 Lee and Kim, 2023 Figure 6 Figure 6 (a) The synthesis process of PDA-JAKi MN. (b) The mechanism mediated by PDA-JAKi MN Figure 6 3.12 Targeted/functionalized drug delivery system While various nanodrug delivery systems have been extensively studied and applied in vitiligo treatment, there's a significant lack of targeting and functionality in current delivery systems. Most simply facilitate transdermal penetration of the stratum corneum and drug delivery, without being specifically designed to address the unique characteristics of the vitiligo microenvironment. For vitiligo pharmacotherapy, a prolonged, slow drug release is more rational. On one hand, this prevents treatment efficacy from being compromised by excessively low drug concentrations; on the other hand, it prevents systemic toxicity induced by excessively high local drug concentrations entering the bloodstream.Therefore, it is crucial to specifically design targeted drug delivery systems based on the characteristics of vitiligo lesional tissue. First, vitiligo lesional tissue is characterized by high ROS levels, overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase-2, and low tyrosinase activity. These features can serve as platforms for constructing microenvironment-responsive nanodrug delivery systems. While such responsive delivery systems have not yet been applied in vitiligo treatment, they have been extensively studied in other skin diseases. For example, Hua et al. synthesized a ROS-sensitive material, methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) sulfide-thiol (mPEG-SS), using mPEG as the parent structure modified with a sulfide linkage. They then constructed calcipotriol-loaded, ROS-responsive nanomicelles via self-assembly for psoriasis treatment ( Ouyang et al., 2019 Zheng et al., 2025 Zhu et al., 2023 + Wang et al., 2024b Zhou et al., 2025 Jeong et al., 2025 In conclusion, targeted/functionalized drug delivery systems have been widely studied in oncology and other dermatological fields like psoriasis, but their application in vitiligo treatment is still in its nascent stages. Considering the specific microenvironment of vitiligo and the requirements for drug delivery systems, combining functional carriers with microenvironment-responsive release strategies, where both the carrier and microenvironment control the rate and extent of drug release at the lesion site, can maximize efficacy while preventing systemic drug absorption, thereby enhancing the safety of local drug administration. 4 Summary and prospects The purpose of this review is to systematically summarize the pathogenesis, treatment methods, challenges, and the latest research progress of drug delivery systems related to vitiligo, providing a reference for precise diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Vitiligo is an acquired skin depigmentation disorder that severely affects the physical and mental health of patients, with an increasing incidence each year. The onset of vitiligo is associated with genetic factors, cellular immune dysregulation, humoral immune dysregulation, abnormal secretion of cytokines and chemokines, oxidative stress, melanocyte dysfunction, mitochondrial structural and functional abnormalities, dysbiosis, and abnormal expression of miRNAs. However, the exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Despite the many mechanisms involved in vitiligo, oxidative stress-induced damage to melanocytes triggered by external stimuli is considered a key initiating factor, while immune imbalance is closely associated with melanocyte damage and the rapid progression of vitiligo. Therefore, the oxidative stress-immune imbalance-melanocyte damage pathway is crucial for further study of vitiligo.Vitiligo treatment includes various methods such as topical treatments, phototherapy, systemic therapy, targeted therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, depigmentation therapy, and surgical transplantation. While clear treatment targets and effective therapies are still lacking, current treatments can significantly inhibit disease progression and, in some cases, even cure it. Moreover, with the deepening of research, several immune therapeutic targets related to vitiligo have been identified, such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, PDE-4 inhibitors, CXC chemokines, and their receptor inhibitors. Particularly, PDE-4 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors have shown promising efficacy and safety in multiple clinical trials, signaling a new phase in drug treatment for vitiligo. Additionally, increasing evidence confirms that sequential therapy is critical in treating vitiligo and autoimmune diseases. Targeting cells, complement pathways, and downstream regulators related to pathogenesis, eliminating B cells, and using anti-inflammatory drugs can rapidly control the inflammatory response in vitiligo. Immune memory plays a vital role in verifying persistence, and it is crucial to eliminate vitiligo-related immune memory while retaining beneficial immune memory. For vitiligo, adaptive immune memory primarily resides in specific subgroups of B and T cells, so theoretically, targeting cells associated with immune memory or promoting T cell immune tolerance could reset the immune system. For example, due to the presence of tissue-resident memory T cells, current treatments like JAK inhibitors cannot achieve a cure, and relapse occurs once treatment is discontinued. Treg cells play an important role in immune tolerance and immune homeostasis, and regulating Treg cells to promote immune homeostasis and tissue repair may be more suitable for preventing rapid relapse after control is achieved.Currently, strategies targeting Treg cells include IL-2R agonists, TNFR2 agonists, and antigen-specific engineered Treg cell therapies. These approaches can increase the number and function of Treg cells to better control immune imbalance in vitiligo patients. In the treatment of vitiligo, particular attention must be paid to the high relapse rate after patients achieve remission, as well as the local delivery barrier for treatment drugs. Therefore, efficiently and accurately delivering drugs to the lesion site while effectively preventing rapid relapse is key to achieving a potential cure for vitiligo.Nanodrug delivery systems have been widely applied in dermatological treatments and show immense developmental potential. These systems can overcome the limitations of therapeutic drugs’ physicochemical properties by utilizing the advantages of carriers and achieve sustained and slow drug release through interactions with the skin’s stratum corneum, enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity. Currently, nanodrug delivery systems used in dermatology include polymer-based, lipid-based, microemulsion, hydrogel, and microneedle systems. Among these, hydrogels and microneedles have significantly improved treatment outcomes for skin diseases and have attracted significant attention from major pharmaceutical companies globally. While research on nanodrug delivery systems related to vitiligo is still limited, existing studies have demonstrated the significant research value of nanodrug delivery systems for vitiligo treatment.At the same time, we must recognize that vitiligo diagnosis and treatment still face significant challenges, including unclear pathogenesis, skin barrier limitations on drug absorption, low drug concentration at the target site, and the need for optimization and innovation in treatment strategies, all of which contribute to the unsatisfactory overall treatment outcomes for patients. Future research should focus on further exploring the pathogenesis of vitiligo, particularly the interaction between genes and environmental factors. Additionally, clinical trials for innovative technologies should be promoted to explore more effective treatment options. Integrating modern biomedical technology with traditional medical theories could bring new breakthroughs in vitiligo treatment and improve patients’quality of life. In conclusion, vitiligo research and treatment still require continuous exploration to provide patients with more effective treatment options.
