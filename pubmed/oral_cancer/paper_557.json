Background and Objectives We characterised an Ag-Chitosan-NaF product (ClearDefense), marketed for off-label use in caries arrest in children, as an alternative to 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF). The label lists 0.2% Ag + − Methods We followed U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines to describe the composition and stability of the product and assess its safety for children. Results The product features heterogeneous AgNPs: 86% irregular spherical (32 ± 26 nm), 6% triangular (101 ± 100 nm), and 8% rod-shaped (42 ± 28 nm length, 16 ± 10 nm width). Ag-Chitosan-NaF exhibits agglomeration with Chitosan and NaF, and stability studies reveal an increase in Ag + Clinical Significance This Ag-Chitosan-NaF product requires refinement to meet the standards for formulation, purity, and safety for paediatric off-label use. Conclusions ClearDefense differs from the FDA-approved 38% SDF, raising concerns about consistency and paediatric suitability. A thorough reassessment by the manufacturer is needed to meet paediatric clinical standards.

ImageJ analysis showed agglomerated AgNPs with diverse morphologies, including spheres, triangles, hexagons, and rods. TEM analysis showed 86% of AgNPs were irregular spheres (32 ± 26 nm), 6% triangles (101 ± 100 nm), and 8% rods (42 ± 28 nm long, 16 ± 10 nm wide) ( Figure 1 26 , 32 Fig. 1 (A) Representative TEM image of ClearDefense (Ag-Chitosan-NaF) with (B) distribution histogram, (C) UV-Vis spectra and (D) DLS measurement. Fig 1 Stability The stability, functionality, safety, shelf life, and reproducibility of biomedical applications are influenced by size, shape, metal core composition, and surface properties. 47 48 Figure 2 49 50 51 Fig. 2 (A) Representative UV-vis spectra of ClearDefense (Ag-Chitosan-NaF) over weeks and (B) ICP-MS analysis of filtrates to monitor Ag + Fig 2 Product composition, formulation, and purity The composition and purity of AgNP formulations are crucial; an imbalance of Ag⁺ ions can lead to degradation and unwanted toxicity, while residual synthesis byproducts may exacerbate toxicity. 41 52 35 36 , 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 32 Figure S1 63 Preliminary safety assessment of Ag-Chitosan-NaF A preliminary safety assessment of AgNPs is essential due to the growing use of AgNPs in consumer and medical products, such as the Ag-Chitosan-NaF formulation. Zebrafish have been used for decades in nanomaterial toxicity testing (ISO/TS 22082:2020). Their embryos are ideal for studies due to their rapid development, transparency, and similarities to human biology. They progress from undifferentiated cells to fully functional larvae in just 5 days, a timeline conserved among vertebrates. Embryos were exposed to various concentrations of the final formulation (n = 24/concentration), either directly or after simulating application and drying. All experiments were performed in compliance with national care and use guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Oregon State University. Our toxicity testing led to mortality in embryos exposed to 0.125 mg Ag/L, equivalent to 25 mg Ag/kg body mass ( Figure 3 Fig. 3 Concentration-response of embryonic zebrafish mortality after 5 days of exposure to varying concentrations of ClearDefense formulation. Data represent 2 experimental replicates (n = 12 for each) for a total of n = 24 for each exposure condition. Fig 3 Discussion and conclusions This study assesses the safety and characteristics of the ClearDefense for potential off-label use in children to prevent dental caries. The formulation includes heterogeneous AgNPs in a chitosan matrix with NaF and acetic acid. While the product has received FDA clearance for treating tooth sensitivity in adults aged 21 and older, its use in paediatric dentistry has not yet been supported by sufficient evidence regarding safety and efficacy. Current findings indicate that the formulation may not meet established standards for purity, stability, or paediatric use. ClearDefense differs from 38% SDF in effectiveness, with concerns about consistency and regulatory clarity. Manufacturer reassessment is recommended, including clear labelling for paediatric off-label use. Clinicians should avoid such use in children, and discolored products should be discarded as a precaution. Manufacturers should adhere to NIST quality standards, including stability testing and clear shelf-life labelling. AgNP-based formulations should be clearly labelled as metal nanomaterials due to their distinct properties from ionic silver. All components must be verified for consistency and safety. Clinicians should also be informed of the lack of paediatric safety data and potential toxicity risks associated with off-label use. By prioritising evidence-based practices and compliance, we can ensure innovations like ClearDefense are safe and effective for our most vulnerable patients.
