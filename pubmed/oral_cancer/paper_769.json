However, conventional agricultural practices often involve excessive use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and water, leading to soil degradation, water pollution, and ecosystem imbalances. In this context, agricultural nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative field, offering innovative solutions to enhance crop productivity, improve soil health, and ensure sustainable agricultural practices. This review has explored the wide-ranging uses of nanotechnology in agriculture, highlighting innovative plant-targeted delivery systems—such as polymer-based nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, dendrimers, metal oxide particles, and nanoemulsions—as well as its contributions to minimizing pesticide application, alleviating plant stress, and improving interactions between plants and nanoparticles. By examining recent research and development, the review highlights the potential of nanotechnology to address critical challenges such as pest resistance, nutrient management, and environmental sustainability. In conclusion, we believe that, in the immediate future, key priorities should include: (1) scaling up field trials to validate laboratory findings, (2) developing biodegradable nanomaterials to ensure environmental safety, and (3) integrating nanotechnology with digital agriculture platforms to enable real-time monitoring and adaptive management. These steps are essential for translating promising research into practical, sustainable solutions that can effectively support global food security. agricultural nanotechnology nanofertilizers nanopesticides nanocarriers nanosensors sustainable agriculture environmental sustainability This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Agriculture, which encompasses the diverse methods by which cultivated plants and domesticated animals support the global population through the provision of food and other essential goods [ 1 2 3 4 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 7 12 13 Figure 1 2. From Interaction to Innovation: Nanoparticles in Plant Science and Sustainable Agriculture Among various applications of nanotechnology, the use of nanoparticles (NPs) stands out due to their unique physicochemical properties, such as high surface area, reactivity, and the ability to interact with biological systems at the molecular level [ 14 15 16 17 18 Figure 2 Table 1 3. Nanotechnology in Plant Drug Delivery Nanotechnology is playing an innovative role in agriculture by enabling precision delivery of agrochemicals to plants. This approach not only improves the efficiency of active compound usage but also minimizes environmental impact, waste, and off-target toxicity [ 31 32 33 34 Figure 3 The application of nanoparticles in agriculture holds great promise for improving nutrient delivery, pest control, and stress tolerance. However, several challenges must be addressed for their safe and effective use. One major challenge is phytotoxicity: NPs can be harmful to plants at high concentrations, causing oxidative stress, membrane damage, or growth inhibition [ 35 36 37 38 Table 2 3.1. Biopolymeric Nanoparticles Polymeric nanoparticles can be synthesized using chemical, physical, or biological methods [ 58 59 60 61 62 Table 2 21 21 For instance, chitosan NPs (1000–5000 ppm) reduced Fusarium infection in wheat by 40–60% while showing lower phytotoxicity compared to bulk chitosan. Alginate/chitosan nanoparticles were developed as carriers for the hydrophobic compound quercetin, a polyphenolic flavonoid with multiple bioactive properties by Nalini et al. The NPs were prepared via ionotropic gelation of chitosan with sodium tripolyphosphate, followed by alginate polyelectrolyte complexation. Characterization by ATR-FTIR, SEM, TEM, and XRD confirmed their well-defined spherical architecture with particle sizes ranging from 118 to 255 nm. They exhibited high quercetin encapsulation efficiency (82.4%) and loading capacity (46.5%), demonstrating their potential as effective and stable delivery systems for bioactive compounds in plants [ 63 Solanum lycopersicum 64 65 R. solani 66 Generally, biopolymeric nanoparticles represent a promising technology to increase agricultural productivity sustainably by maximizing effectiveness while minimizing environmental risks. 3.2. Carbon-Based Nanoparticles Carbon-based nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and fullerenes, are increasingly being explored as efficient nanocarriers in agriculture. Their unique structural properties, including high surface area, chemical stability, and the ability to penetrate biological membranes, make them suitable for transporting agrochemicals. When used as delivery systems, these nanoparticles can improve the solubility and stability of active compounds, allowing for more precise and sustained release at target sites within plants or soil ( Table 2 67 39 41 68 2 2 40 41 Despite their potential, further studies are needed to fully understand their long-term environmental safety and impact on plant health. 3.3. Dendrimers With respect to dendrimers, they are synthetic, tree-like branched nanostructures with numerous surface groups that can be modified for targeted binding [ 22 69 70 Table 2 42 71 43 In summary, adapting dendrimer-based delivery strategies from medicine to agriculture offers a promising route to develop smart, eco-friendly crop protection and enhancement systems. 3.4. Metal Oxide Nanoparticles Among metal oxide nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are emerging as promising nanocarriers for the delivery of biomolecules in plants ( Table 2 45 44 2 3 2 Table 2 49 72 73 74 2 Bacillus subtilis 75 2 3 4 47 Iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe 3 4 2 3 76 77 2 78 Escherichia coli 79 80 3 81 3 Citrus tankan Bactrocera dorsalis 3 82 3.5. Stimuli-Responsive Nanocarriers in Agriculture Stimuli-responsive nanocarriers are advanced delivery systems designed to release fertilizers or pesticides in response to specific environmental triggers or stimuli ( Table 1 25 83 84 85 86 50 Bacillus subtilis E. coli 55 Overall, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers represent a promising approach to improve the precision, efficiency, and sustainability of agrochemical application by ensuring that active compounds are released only when and where they are most needed. 3.6. Nanoemulsions Nanoemulsions are fine dispersions of oil and water stabilized by surfactants, with droplet sizes typically between 20 and 200 nm [ 87 Table 1 56 88 89 56 57 In summary, while nanoemulsions represent a promising advancement for agricultural drug delivery by improving efficacy and sustainability, their successful implementation depends on addressing environmental safety concerns, developing clear regulatory frameworks, and ensuring economic accessibility for all farmers. 4. Nanotechnology for Efficient Use of Fertilizers Among the major challenges in agriculture, the inefficient use of fertilizers has attracted a lot of attention: traditional fertilizers often suffer from low nutrient-use efficiency, with significant losses due to leaching, volatilization, or fixation in the soil. Thus, to overcome this criticism, the development of nano-fertilizers, materials that contain nutrients either encapsulated within nanoparticles or coated onto their surface, has been proposed [ 25 24 24 22 5. Nanotechnology for Efficient Water Use and Soil Health Maintenance Efficient water use and soil health maintenance are critical components of sustainable agriculture. Nanoparticles play a role in both areas. For example, nano-clays and other nanomaterials can improve soil structure, enhance water retention, and aid in slow-release fertilizer formulations [ 27 28 29 50 90 91 51 30 Figure 4 92 93 6. Nanotechnology for Reducing Pesticide Use Pesticides are chemical substances or mixtures of biological agents used on purpose to prevent, control, or kill harmful organisms (insects, weeds, rodents, fungi, and other pests). They work as destroying, repelling, or mitigating agents; depending on their target, they are called herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, molluscicides, nematicides, or plant growth regulators [ 95 96 95 97 95 98 99 100 98 101 97 99 In recent years, nanotechnology in agriculture gained a lot of global attention because it can help detect, break down, and remove harmful pesticides, through nano-formulated pesticides [ 101 101 23 53 102 101 Furthermore, many insecticides have low water solubility and require organic solvents to help solubilize the pesticide, increasing their toxicity and cost. Nanoparticles such as polymers, silica, and chitosan can improve solubility, reduce volatilization, and enhance stability, while allowing a slow, controlled release of the active compounds [ 103 19 20 104 Plutella xylostella Spodoptera littoralis 5 7. Mitigating Plant Stress Using Nanomolecular Techniques Plants can be exposed to various types of stress, which are generally classified into two main categories: biotic and abiotic stress. Biotic stress refers to stress caused by living organisms, such as fungi or bacteria, while abiotic stress is caused by non-living factors, including drought, pollution, or other climatic conditions affecting agriculture worldwide [ 105 As previously mentioned, the most common types of abiotic stress include salinity, heavy metals, suboptimal temperatures, waterlogging, and others [ 105 105 106 2 46 47 2 107 Raphanus sativus 54 108 109 48 Trichoderma harzianum 2 26 110 2 w v 52 8. Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives Agricultural nanotechnology has emerged as a groundbreaking frontier in the pursuit of sustainable and efficient farming practices, to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural practices. This review has examined the diverse applications of nanotechnology in agriculture, including advanced plant drug delivery systems—such as polymeric nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles, dendrimers, metal oxide nanoparticles, and nanoemulsions—as well as its role in reducing pesticide use, mitigating plant stress, and enhancing plant-nanoparticle interactions. The integration of nanoparticles into agricultural systems offers promising benefits, from improving nutrient use efficiency and crop resilience to minimizing environmental impact. Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) show significant potential in agriculture due to their ability to damage pests by interacting with the exoskeleton and penetrating cell membranes, as in the case of AgNPs smaller than 10 nm, and by stimulating immune responses that promote pest elimination [ 111 In fact, despite these advantages, concerns persist regarding the environmental fate, bioaccumulation, and long-term effects of nanoparticles on ecosystems and human health. Addressing these challenges requires the development of biodegradable nanomaterials, robust regulatory frameworks, and transparent risk assessments. Some studies report no significant toxicity of silver nanoparticles, either in vitro or in vivo, even under conditions considered critical in the literature [ 112 32 In the European Union, current guidelines for the use of nanoparticles in the agri-food sector are outlined by the Scientific Committee Guidance on Nano Risk Assessment by the EFSA [ 113 113 In the United States, the use of nanoparticles is regulated by multiple authorities. In the agricultural sector, the main institutions involved are the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as detailed in the National Nanotechnology Initiative Environmental, Health, and Safety Research Strategy: 2024 Update. The NNI provides general guidelines, including exposure limits and voluntary standards. The EPA enforces the Toxic Substances Control Act, while the FDA focuses on drugs and biologic products. Additionally, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are responsible for assessing the impact of nanomaterials on consumer health and establishing exposure limits in the occupational settings [ 114 The fate, transport, and bioaccumulation of nanoparticles in soil, plants, and aquatic systems need to be carefully studied [ 115 32 32 116 117 While the technology may perform well in the laboratory, scaling up presents challenges related to consistency, reproducibility, and costs, as producing nanomaterials while maintaining the same quality and characteristics achievable in small batches is difficult [ 118 9 Therefore, it is imperative to validate the numerous promising findings from laboratory-based NP studies highlighted in this review through extensive long-term field-scale assessments. Moreover, uncertainties related to the health and environmental effects of large-scale NP supply, coupled with an insufficient detailed understanding of their impacts in different conditions, must be addressed through a combination of additional laboratory investigations and field-scale pilot projects. In this context, in the future comparative efficiency of different nano-fertilizers, or a SWOT analysis of nanotechnology in agriculture will have to be carried out. In fact, future research should include a comparative assessment of the efficiency of different nano-fertilizers, a SWOT analysis of nanotechnology applications in agriculture, and a thorough evaluation of their scalability and socioeconomic implications. It will also be important to critically examine conflicting evidence regarding their long-term effectiveness and environmental impact. Adoption barriers—including production costs, smallholder access, consumer acceptance, and ethical considerations—are crucial to real-world implementation and should be addressed in future work. In summary, nanotechnology offers new ways to solve problems caused by traditional pesticides, which can damage health and environment [ 95 119 120 121 6 103 120 122 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.P., C.C. and I.C.; methodology, M.P., F.B., G.M., C.C., E.L. and I.C.; formal analysis, M.P., F.B., G.M., C.C., E.L. and I.C.; investigation, M.P., F.B., G.M., C.C., E.L. and I.C.; data curation, M.P., F.B., G.M., C.C., E.L. and I.C.; writing—original draft preparation, M.P., F.B., G.M., C.C., E.L. and I.C.; writing—review and editing, M.P., C.C., E.L. and I.C.; visualization, M.P., F.B., G.M., C.C., E.L. and I.C.; supervision, M.P., C.C. and I.C.
