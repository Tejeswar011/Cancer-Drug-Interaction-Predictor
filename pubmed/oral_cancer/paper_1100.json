Results of the ALTA 1L study showed superior outcomes for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC treated with brigatinib compared to patients treated with crizotinib. We conducted research on patients with ALK-positive NSCLC treated with brigatinib in the first and further therapy lines. Response rate was 47.8%, and disease control was 95.6%. The 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 85.3% and 86.5%, respectively, while the 60-month PFS rate was not reached, and the 60-month OS rate was 27.1%. The mPFS and mOS were 32 months. The results of this analysis are promising, as our patients experienced better outcomes compared to those in the ALTA 1L study.

Introduction Despite the significant progress in the treatment of lung cancer, it still represents a major cause of cancer-related death in both genders [ 1 1 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all cases of lung cancer [ 2 2 2 2 Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement can be found in 3–5% of all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases [ 3 3 3 Further, the results showed that 30–40% of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC had brain metastases at baseline [ 4 5 6 7 8 Before the introduction of ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the median progression-free survival (PFS) for this group of patients when treated with chemotherapy was 7 months, and their prognosis was poor [ 3 3 9 3 9 3 9 Ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib represent the second generation of ALK TKIs. These drugs were developed in order to overcome the inevitable acquired resistance to crizotinib, which usually occurs within 12 months [ 10 The results of phase I and II studies demonstrated the efficacy of ceritinib in patients who were not treated with crizotinib and also in patients who developed resistance to crizotinib [ 11 6 12 Alectinib, another second-generation ALK TKI, was found to be superior to crizotinib and ceritinib due to higher crossover to the blood–brain barrier [ 11 13 p 14 15 16 17 The ALEX trial compared alectinib to crizotinib in the first-line setting, and results showed the superiority of alectinib, with a significantly higher response rate, PFS, OS, and with a lower incidence of CNS progression compared to crizotinib [ 7 7 Brigatinib is an oral second-generation ALK TKI that has been proven to be active against the majority of known resistant mutations [ 18 19 However, at some time point, the acquired resistance also occurs with the second generation of ALK TKI. Lorlatinib, the third generation of ALK TKIs, is active against the majority of known on-target resistance mutations after treatment with second-generation ALK TKIs [ 20 20 The results of the CROWN study, which compared lorlatinib and crizotinib in the first-line setting, demonstrated the superior efficacy of lorlatinib compared to crizotinib [ 21 22 21 22 The discovery of ALK gene rearrangement and subsequent ALK TKIs significantly improved PFS, OS, and quality of life in this group of patients [ 18 The aim of this observational study was to investigate the efficacy of brigatinib in the real-world setting in patients with locally advanced and metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patients and Data Collection We enrolled 23 patients treated with brigatinib who had locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with ALK rearrangement. All included patients were treated in the Clinic for Pulmonology, University Clinical Center of Serbia. All patients are treated until progression of disease or death, whichever happens first. Every patient satisfied the requirements for inclusion: histopathologically confirmed NSCLC with ALK rearrangement positive finding (ALK positivity was determined by Ventana (D5F3) immunohistochemistry assay), locally advanced or metastatic stage of disease, measurable disease at baseline, and patients who were not treated previously with ALK TKIs (some of them were treated with chemotherapy previously). Exclusion criteria—histopathologically verified other subtypes of lung carcinoma, patients who had ALK-negative NSCLC, and early stage of disease. All patients underwent computed tomography of the chest and either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head to establish the stage of disease at baseline. We collected data about gender, age, smoking status [i.e., smokers, non-smokers, and ex-smokers (patients who quit smoking a year prior to treatment)], stage of the disease, response to treatment (ORR), PFS, and OS. Response to treatment was defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progression of disease (PD). PFS was evaluated from the start of the treatment with brigatinib until disease progression or death, and OS was evaluated from the start of the treatment with brigatinib until death from any cause. This non-interventional, observational study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.2. Statistical Analysis Depending on the data type, the results are expressed as means ± standard deviation or count (%). Given the small sample size ( n p p 3. Results A total of 23 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were included in the analysis, of whom 18 were treated with brigatinib in the first-line setting, and 5 patients were treated with brigatinib in further therapy lines (previously treated with chemotherapy). Baseline demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1 The median follow-up time for the whole group was 22 months (ranging from 4 to 66 months). The median age for the whole group was 58.4 ± 16 years. Table 2 The response rate was 47.8% for the whole group of patients, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 95.6%. The data for the entire group of patients, as well as according to the therapy line, are presented in Table 3 The mPFS for the whole group was 32.0 months (95% CI: 19.6–44.4 months), and the mOS was 32 months (95% CI: 19.3–44.7 months) ( Figure 1 Further, 12-month PFS and OS rates were 85.3% and 77.4%, respectively, and 5-year PFS and OS rates were not reached and 27.1%, respectively. The rates of PFS and OS are presented in Table 4 In the first-line setting, mPFS was 44.8 months (95% CI: 27.5–62.1) and mOS was 32 months (95% CI: 3.8–60.2) ( Figure 2 The 12-month PFS and OS rates for patients treated with brigatinib in the first-line setting were 72.4% and 63.8%, respectively, and the 5-year PFS and OS rates were 48.2% and 42.5%, respectively. In Table 5 The mPFS in further lines was 39 months (95% CI: 31.8–46.2 months) and mOS was 33 months (95%CI: 30.9–35.1 months). Since there were only five patients treated with brigatinib in further therapy lines, we presented PFS and OS results for each patient separately ( Figure 3 4. Discussion After the results of the ALTA 1L study [ 19 19 19 19 23 19 19 19 24 The phase 2 J-ALTA trial [ 25 25 25 In the integrated analysis of the ALTA 1L and J-ALTA, there were 137 patients from ALTA 1L and 32 from J-ALTA who were included in the analysis, and they were treatment-naïve [ 26 26 26 26 26 26 26 A study conducted by Jeon et al. [ 27 27 27 27 27 The Table 6 UVEA-Brig was a retrospective study that evaluated the efficacy of brigatinib in previously treated ALK-positive NSCLC (1 to 6 previous therapy lines) in four different countries with a median follow-up of 16.5 months [ 28 28 28 28 A large multicentric study evaluated the efficacy of brigatinib in 604 previously treated patients with NSCLC [ 29 29 In a study by Hochmair et al. [ 30 Singh et al. [ 31 31 31 31 Pike et al. [ 32 32 32 A large meta-analysis analyzed intracranial ORR and DCR in over 1000 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and brain metastases [ 33 33 33 According to current ESMO [ 34 35 The limitations of our study include the small number of patients. With only 23 patients, the use of p 36 5. Conclusions The discovery of ALK TKIs created a revolution in the treatment of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The results of this real-world analysis are promising, as our patients experienced better outcomes compared to those in the ALTA 1L study, a registration study for brigatinib, which may be attributed to the small sample size. However, the effectiveness of brigatinib was confirmed in our clinical practice.
