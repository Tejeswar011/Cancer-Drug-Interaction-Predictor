This study evaluated the long-term outcomes in patients who underwent carbon-ion radiotherapy. The treatment resulted in favorable cancer control and an acceptable incidence of urinary complications. However, an increased risk of hematuria was observed in patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate or radiotherapy shortly after surgery. This study validates carbon-ion radiotherapy as a viable treatment method in this specific population and highlights the importance of individualized treatment planning and long-term monitoring, ultimately improving management of radioresistant malignancies such as prostate cancer.

Introduction Prostate cancer is a primary global health concern, ranking as the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer overall and the second most common among men worldwide, with approximately 1.47 million new cases recorded in 2022 (7.3% of all cancers) [ 1 2 3 4 5 Despite favorable outcomes reported in the general population, the safety profile of CIRT in specific clinical settings remains elusive, particularly in patients with a history of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Notably, surgical procedures for BPH, including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP), are commonly performed in older men with lower urinary tract symptoms [ 6 7 8 TURP-related adverse outcomes have been reported not only in RT but also in surgical interventions for prostate cancer [ 9 10 11 12 13 In conventional RT settings (such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy), a history of BPH surgery has also been consistently associated with a higher incidence of late GU complications [ 14 15 16 17 This single-center retrospective study aimed to evaluate the long-term safety of CIRT in patients with prostate cancer and a history of BPH surgery. Specifically, we assessed the incidence and severity of late GU complications and examined oncological outcomes, including biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) and local control. Although we evaluated treatment efficacy, the primary focus of this analysis was on safety and tolerability. By addressing a critical gap in the literature, this study sought to support the safe and effective use of CIRT in patients with surgical modifications, thereby expanding access to high-precision, curative-intent RT. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patients and Study Design This retrospective cohort study evaluated the safety and efficacy of CIRT for prostate cancer in patients with a history of transurethral or open adenomectomy for BPH. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of QST Hospital (approval number: N24-022) and was publicly disclosed on the institution’s website. All potential participants were given the option to opt out. An opt-out approach was employed instead of written informed consent, and all data used in this study, including cystoscopy images, were fully anonymized with no identifiable information. Many patients were referred to our institution after being deemed unsuitable for radical prostatectomy or photon-based radiotherapy at other hospitals. The reasons for selecting CIRT included advanced age, comorbidities, unfavorable anatomical conditions following BPH surgery, or patient preference for a non-surgical modality. Eligible patients included those diagnosed with prostate cancer who underwent CIRT in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Surgical treatment for BPH before CIRT was performed in patients who were unresponsive to medical therapy or in those presenting with severe lower urinary tract symptoms. Surgical approaches included TURP, which involves the resection of obstructive prostatic tissue using an electrocautery loop; transurethral enucleation using bipolar energy (TUEB); and laser-based procedures, such as HoLEP and photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP), which are considered less invasive alternatives. In selected cases, simple suprapubic prostatectomy (SPP) was performed via an extraperitoneal approach to enucleate the enlarged adenomas. In addition, transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), a minimally invasive procedure that uses microwave energy to induce thermal necrosis of the prostatic tissue, was also employed. In patients with a history of multiple BPH surgeries, the most recent procedure was considered for categorization of the surgical technique. 2.2. CIRT CIRT was administered according to previously established protocols. Carbon-ion beams were delivered once daily, 4 days per week, targeting the prostate and seminal vesicles. Radiation doses were expressed in Gy (RBE-weighted dose based on the modified microdosimetric kinetic model) [ 18 2.3. ADT ADT was administered based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk classification. Treatment comprised subcutaneous injections of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogs, with or without oral antiandrogens. Patients with low-risk diseases did not undergo ADT. Intermediate-risk patients underwent neoadjuvant ADT for 3–7 months in combination with CIRT, whereas high-risk patients received ADT for 24 months, including both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases. 2.4. Follow-Up and Endpoint Assessment Patients were followed up every 3–6 months within the first 5 years post-CIRT and every 6–12 months thereafter. Biochemical recurrence was defined according to the Phoenix definition (nadir prostate-specific antigen [PSA] + 2.0 ng/mL), excluding transient PSA elevations attributable to benign causes or fluctuations within the threshold. bRFS was calculated from the time of CIRT or neoadjuvant ADT initiation. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed through clinical interviews, laboratory tests, and endoscopic evaluations and categorized as acute or late relative to CIRT initiation. Acute events were defined as those occurring within 3 months, and late events as those occurring thereafter. Events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. 2.5. Statistical Analysis Survival outcome was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Group comparisons were performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Statistical significance was set at p 19 3. Results 3.1. Patient Characteristics Between 2007 and 2023, 3848 patients with prostate cancer underwent CIRT at our institution, of whom 74 (1.9%) had previously undergone surgery for BPH. The median patient age was 67 years at the time of BPH surgery and 75.5 years at CIRT initiation, with a median interval of 8 years between the two interventions. According to NCCN risk groups, 4.1% were low-risk, 48.6% intermediate-risk, and 47.3% high-risk. Prior BPH procedures included TURP in 66.2% of patients and HoLEP in 20.3%, with SPP, TUEB, PVP, and TUMT performed less frequently; three patients underwent multiple procedures. The baseline characteristics of the 74 patients are summarized in Table 1 3.2. Adverse Events (AEs) 3.2.1. Acute AEs CIRT was well tolerated acutely. Grade 2 GU toxicity was observed in 4 of 74 patients (5.4%): urinary frequency in three patients (4.1%) and dysuria in one (1.4%). No Grade ≥ 3 acute GU events were observed. Acute GI toxicity was negligible, with no Grade ≥ 2 events. The overall incidence rates of grade 2–3 acute and late GU and GI events are summarized in Table 2 A detailed, event-specific breakdown of all acute Grade 2–3 GU and GI toxicities is presented—alongside the corresponding late events—in Table 3 3.2.2. Late AEs Late Grade ≥ 2 GU toxicity was observed in seven patients (9.5%): Grade 2 hematuria in three patients (4.1%), urinary frequency in one (1.4%), urethral stricture in one (1.4%), and Grade 3 hematuria in one (1.4%). Several cases of gross hematuria developed months to years after CIRT, and urethral strictures required intervention. Late GI toxicity was infrequent, with only one case (1.4%) of Grade 2 rectal hemorrhage, and no Grade ≥ 3 GI events. The late event data are also included in Table 3 3.2.3. Cystoscopic Findings in Patients with Hematuria On cystoscopy, gross hematuria was invariably associated with mucosal telangiectasia, consistent with radiation cystitis ( Figure 1 3.3. Hematuria Risk and Time-to-Event Analyses 3.3.1. Risk-Factor Analysis for Hematuria To identify the clinical predictors of hematuria following CIRT in patients with a history of BPH surgery, we performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses for both Grades ≥ 1 and ≥2 hematuria. The results are summarized in Table 4 For Grade ≥ 1 hematuria, univariate analysis revealed no significant predictors. However, a shorter interval between BPH surgery and CIRT showed a non-significant trend toward increased bleeding risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.93 per year, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85–1.02, p p p p To further evaluate the predictive utility of the interval between BPH surgery and CIRT, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.63, indicating modest discriminative ability. The optimal cutoff value, determined using the Youden index, was 6.5 years, which yielded a 66.7% sensitivity and a 66.1% specificity. These findings suggest that patients receiving CIRT within 6.5 years post-BPH surgery may be at a higher risk of developing hematuria. The ROC curve is shown in Figure 2 For Grade ≥ 2 hematuria, seven events were observed. In univariate analysis, diabetes mellitus was the only significant predictor (OR = 9.0, 95% CI: 1.09–74.2, p p p 3.3.2. Time-to-Event Analysis of Hematuria Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that the cumulative probability of freedom from hematuria gradually decreased over time, reaching approximately 75% at 5 years ( Figure 3 Subgroup analyses showed a non-significant trend toward a higher incidence of hematuria in patients with a history of TURP compared with HoLEP (5-year hematuria-free probability: ~70% vs. ~90%, log-rank p Supplementary Figure S1 p Supplementary Figure S2 3.4. Cumulative Incidence of Grade ≥ 2 GU AEs To provide a more comprehensive perspective on the overall safety profile of CIRT in this patient population, we evaluated the cumulative incidence of all Grade ≥ 2 GU AEs—including, but not limited to, hematuria, dysuria, urinary frequency, and urinary retention—using the Kaplan–Meier method. At 12, 24, and 36 months post-CIRT, the cumulative incidence rates for these GU events were 0.0%, 1.4%, and 5.0%, respectively. The curve gradually increased without a distinct inflection point, and the overall rate consistently remained <10% throughout the follow-up period, indicating that severe GU toxicity post-CIRT in patients with a history of BPH surgery was relatively uncommon ( Figure 4 3.5. Oncological Outcomes Oncological outcomes were favorable across all risk groups. The 5-year bRFS rate was 100% in both the low- and intermediate-risk groups, with no recurrences observed. In the high-risk group, the 5-year bRFS was 88.6% [0.749, 0.991], indicating that most patients remained biochemically disease-free 5 years post-treatment, with only a few experiencing recurrences. These results suggest excellent midterm tumor control following CIRT in patients with a history of BPH surgery, particularly in low- and intermediate-risk groups. Outcomes in high-risk patients were also favorable. The Kaplan–Meier curves illustrating bRFS by risk group are shown in Figure 5 4. Discussion This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of CIRT in patients with prostate cancer who had undergone surgical intervention for BPH, including TURP and HoLEP. With an aging population, prostate cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent in individuals with prior BPH surgery. Despite their clinical relevance, such patients have been underrepresented in radiation oncology studies, primarily due to concerns regarding treatment-associated GU complications. Studies have reported that transurethral procedures are associated with various urinary sequelae, including urethral stricture (2.2–9.8%), bladder neck sclerosis (0.3–9.2%), and urinary incontinence (1–6%) [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Despite these potential vulnerabilities, our findings indicate that CIRT is generally well-tolerated in this population. Our analysis demonstrated a low cumulative incidence of Grade ≥ 2 hematuria, with rates of 1.4% and 5.0% at 24 and 36 months, respectively, and no cases within the first 12 months. This gradual increase suggests a delayed onset of clinically significant hematuria, rather than immediate post-treatment effects. Overall, Grade ≥ 2 late GU events were observed in 8.1% of patients, including one case (1.4%) of Grade 3 hematuria. Although these rates (8.1% in our cohort) are modestly higher than those reported in large-scale CIRT registries, such as the J-CROS study (5.0%) [ 28 Cystoscopy consistently revealed mucosal erosion and dilated capillaries at the bladder neck of patients presenting with hematuria, suggesting that previously operated fields are particularly susceptible to radiation-related vascular injury and impaired tissue regeneration. Furthermore, differences in hematuria incidence were observed between the surgical modalities, with a higher rate among patients who underwent TURP than among those who underwent HoLEP. Histopathological studies have shown that HoLEP confines thermal injury to a narrow rim of approximately 0.4–1 mm, thereby minimizing collateral damage to deeper prostatic tissues and vasculature [ 23 29 23 30 28 31 32 33 34 35 Given these risks, supportive strategies should be incorporated into treatment planning to minimize urinary morbidity and preserve long-term function. Dose optimization around the bladder neck and periurethral region is essential, particularly in patients with prior TURP. Practical measures, such as the appropriate use of fiducial markers and hydrogel spacers (primarily to reduce rectal exposure and facilitate conformal planning in anatomically altered pelves) [ 36 37 While our findings provide objective evidence of safety, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as urinary function, quality of life, and decision regret were not evaluated in this study. These measures are increasingly recognized as essential for capturing the full impact of treatment beyond physician-reported toxicities [ 38 39 40 Oncological outcomes appeared favorable. The 5-year bRFS rates were 100% in the low- and intermediate-risk groups and 88.6% in the high-risk group, comparable to or slightly exceeding outcomes of patients without prior BPH surgery [ 28 41 42 43 44 45 46 This study has several limitations, including its retrospective single-institution design, small cohort size, and relatively short follow-up. Moreover, the absence of a comparison group without prior BPH surgery limits generalizability, and parameters such as PVR and PROs were unavailable. These factors collectively warrant cautious interpretation. 5. Conclusions CIRT provides excellent biochemical control and acceptable late toxicity in patients with prostate cancer and a history of BPH surgery. The cumulative incidence of Grade ≥ 2 GU-AEs remained low (5% at 36 months), and severe events were rare, underscoring the feasibility of CIRT even in anatomically altered pelvic fields. Individualized treatment planning that accounts for age-related frailty and prior surgical anatomy, alongside vigilant long-term surveillance for delayed urinary complications, is essential. Overall, these results support CIRT as a promising curative option in this surgically altered population. However, the absence of a non-BPH control group necessitates cautious generalization, and confirmation in larger prospective cohorts incorporating functional outcomes will be necessary to establish its role more definitively.
