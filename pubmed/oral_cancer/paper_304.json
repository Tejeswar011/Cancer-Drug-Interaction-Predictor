Distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0) Sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome marked by dysregulated immune responses, systemic inflammation, and subsequent organ dysfunction. Sepsis involves the interplay of multiple signaling pathways. Traditional sepsis treatment mainly depends on antibiotics and early directed therapy, with limited effectiveness. This article reviews major signaling pathways in sepsis, such as those related to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2/Keap1). These molecules are pivotal in regulating immune activation, inflammation, and immune cell metabolism. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming substantially contribute to sepsis development, as they greatly affect energy production and immune cell function. Selectively inhibiting these pathways shows potential for effectively reducing hyperinflammation and preventing organ failure. We discussed how future research on these signaling pathways can translate into clinical applications and how personalized treatment strategies can handle the complexity and variability of sepsis. Given the dynamic nature of sepsis, treatment strategies should not solely rely on traditional single-target interventions. Instead, a dynamic and personalized multi-target modulatory approach is needed. While reducing side effects of single-target inhibition, inflammatory responses, immune balance, and metabolic disorders can be more precisely regulated. By precisely monitoring multiple sepsis-related signaling pathways and adjusting treatment regimens in real time, we aim to identify more effective intervention points in the complex dynamics of diseases, thus providing new hope for improving prognosis of septic patients.

On one hand, multiple signaling pathways, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), have been proven to be closely associated with sepsis [ 5 6 7 In the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, there are persistent clinical challenges and unmet medical needs. These have prompted the academic community to make the in-depth exploration of sepsis’s pathological mechanisms and related signaling pathways the core direction for formulating precise treatment strategies. This review focuses on the key signaling pathways related to the immune response and metabolic disorders during the progression of sepsis. It systematically integrates preclinical experimental data and clinical research evidence, as well as the latest research achievements in molecular and cellular biology. The study mainly analyzes core signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and TLR. Moreover, it deeply interprets how these pathways regulate various pathological processes in sepsis. These processes cover immune regulation imbalance, uncontrolled inflammatory response, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic reprogramming. We reveal the molecular targets of each signaling pathway and their upstream and downstream regulatory relationships. Then, by combining with the individual differences of patients in clinical practice, we explore potential treatment strategies based on these signaling pathways. This research not only provides a theoretical basis for the development of innovative targeted therapies for sepsis but also is committed to promoting the development of personalized medical strategies and achieving the precise customization of treatment plans. As our understanding of the complex cellular signaling network and metabolic remodeling mechanisms of sepsis continues to deepen, we expect to develop a new generation of therapeutic intervention methods. These methods can reduce the disease’s complexity and improve patient survival rates. This review conducts an in-depth analysis of the signaling pathways with therapeutic potential, further highlighting the importance of targeted treatment strategies in tackling sepsis, a global health problem, and laying a solid theoretical foundation for improving the clinical prognosis of sepsis patients. Immune Regulation in Sepsis Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening condition that involves a dysregulated immune response. The diversity of immune responses to sepsis is influenced by factors such as age (notably in young children and the elderly), infection type and location, genetics, and treatment strategies [ 8 9 However, sepsis is characterized by a severe dysregulation of the immune system. A key feature is the biphasic immune dysfunction, which consists of an initial, overwhelming inflammatory response followed by an immunosuppressive phase. This biphasic pattern is fundamental to the pathophysiology of sepsis [ 8 10 11 Among different patients, the natural progression of sepsis shows variable adverse effects. Despite improvements in survival rates brought about by antibiotic treatments and supportive care, effectively managing disease progression remains a substantial challenge. This challenge is partly attributable to unresolved heterogeneity in patient immune imbalances [ 12 NF-κB signaling pathway NF-κB signaling is a fundamental regulator of the immune response, bifurcating into 2 distinct pathways: the classical (canonical) and nonclassical (alternative) pathways [ 13 14 15 16 While the classical NF-κB pathway is a well-known mechanism for initiating immune responses, the nonclassical NF-κB signaling pathway also plays important roles in various physiological processes. It can be initiated by CD40 ligands, lymphotoxin β (LTβ), and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; also referred to as endotoxin), leading to the activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) [ 17 18 1 Fig. 1. Molecular mechanisms of classical and nonclassical NF-κB pathways in sepsis pathogenesis. Sepsis is a life-threatening SIRS triggered by infection, often leading to MOF. The NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in this pathological process. Within the classical NF-κB pathway, sepsis-inducing agents, such as LPS, initiate a downstream signaling cascade through the activation of TLRs, culminating in the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Activated NF-κB enhances the transcription of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, worsening systemic inflammation. NF-κB also regulates apoptosis and immune cell activation, crucial in sepsis development. The nonclassical NF-κB pathway involves unique activation mechanisms in specific cell types or stimuli, using different kinases, cofactors, and NF-κB subunit combinations. (By Figdraw.) The interplay between pro-inflammatory cytokines and the NF-κB signaling pathway further complicates its role in the immune response. Pro-inflammatory cytokines sustain the NF-κB signaling pathway via an autocrine mechanism, a cascade that facilitates the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, thereby promoting pathogen elimination [ 19 20 Notably, NF-κB’s function extends beyond promoting inflammation. It also modulates the expression of genes related to anti-inflammatory pathways and tissue repair, highlighting its dual role in both propagating and resolving inflammation [ 21 22 23 JAK/STAT signaling pathway There is a group of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-11, and oncostatin M (OSM), that signal through the common receptor subunit glycoprotein 130 (gp130), activating downstream JAK/STAT pathways. Meanwhile, it also leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT family transcription factors. This group of mediators is sometimes referred to as IL-6-type cytokines. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is also used by type 1 and type 2 cytokine receptors during sepsis. This pathway mediates the signaling of IL-6 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) [ 24 25 26 The canonical JAK/STAT signaling pathway is typically initiated by extracellular signaling molecules, including cytokines, growth factors, and/or hormones, which bind to specific cell surface receptors. This triggers the phosphorylation and activation of adjacent JAK kinases [ 27 28 29 30 31 Beyond the primary components of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, several proteins contribute to the STAT-dependent transcription process and facilitate the interaction of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway with other signaling pathways. These proteins are collectively referred to as regulators of JAK/STAT signaling [ 32 33 27 34 35 36 The JAK/STAT pathway modulates the fate and function of immune cells during sepsis. For instance, IL-6 activates STAT3 that initially provides anti-inflammatory protection in sepsis, but its prolonged activation may contribute to immune paralysis [ 37 38 2 Fig. 2. The transport and activation mechanisms of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and its involvement in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Cytokines such as IFN-γ or IL-6 bind to cell surface receptors, activating JAK kinases, which phosphorylate STAT proteins. These phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and move to the nucleus and regulate genes related to inflammation, cell survival, and differentiation. Abnormal JAK/STAT activation can drive disease progression, impacting immune cell function and causing tissue damage and organ dysfunction. (By Figdraw.) While clinical applications of JAK/STAT inhibitors in sepsis have not yet been reported, their therapeutic use in inflammatory diseases and cancers is already well established. JAK inhibitors mainly inhibit the activation of downstream STAT proteins and block the signaling of inflammatory factors by targeting members of the JAK family [ 39 TLR signaling pathway TLRs are PRRs that function as primary responders within the innate immune system. They recognize conserved microbial structures referred to as PAMPs, thereby initiating an immune response [ 40 TLR4, as the main receptor for recognizing Gram-negative bacteria, has a highly specific recognition ability for LPS, a component of the bacterial cell wall. By binding to TLR4, LPS triggers a series of cascade reactions, inducing host immune cells to release many inflammatory factors, thus driving the pathological progression of sepsis [ 41 42 43 44 The activation of the TLR signaling pathway results in the swift production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which play a crucial role in controlling infections. Although TLR signaling is vital for pathogen recognition and immune activation, excessive or prolonged activation during sepsis has harmful effects [ 45 46 47 48 49 Microbiome metabolic pathways The gut microbiome has been recognized as a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis, with its importance surpassing previous estimations. During sepsis, there is a disruption of both host metabolic processes and immune responses, wherein the gut microbiome plays an essential regulatory role [ 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 Metabolomics, defined as the analysis of metabolites within biological systems, has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering metabolic alterations associated with sepsis [ 57 58 59 60 Future research directions may include multi-omics integration analysis to decode the gut microbiota metabolite network. Through multi-omics integration analysis, the complex interactions between gut microbiota and the host can be revealed. When performing multi-omics integration analysis, by collecting different types of omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc., we can more comprehensively understand the specific roles of microorganisms in host metabolism [ 61 62 Other sepsis immune-related signaling pathways In addition to the aforementioned signaling pathways that play a critical role in the immune response of sepsis patients, the complement system pathways and the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling pathways contribute to immune regulation in sepsis [ 63 64 65 66 67 The NLRP3 inflammasome is a protein complex that regulates caspase-1 activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 [ 68 69 70 3 Fig. 3. Activation mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome in sepsis: A dual-signaling model. In the dual-signaling model, NLRP3 inflammasome activation involves 2 steps: First, NLRP3 expression is up-regulated by PAMPs or DAMPs; second, NLRP3 is activated through intracellular events such as potassium efflux and lysosomal rupture. Activated NLRP3 binds to apoptosis-associated speck-like proteins containing a CARD (ASC) and procaspase-1 to form the inflammasome complex. By cleaving procaspase-1 into active caspase-1, this complex promotes the maturation and release of inflammatory factors such as IL-1 and IL-18. (By Figdraw.) We outline in Table 1 Table 1. Immune signaling pathways’ role in organ damage in sepsis Signaling pathways Organs Mechanism Effect of the intervention References High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) Lung HMGB1 has the capacity to directly interact with alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in cellular damage and initiation of an inflammatory response. During acute lung injury (ALI), HMGB1 facilitates the polarization of macrophages toward the M1 phenotype and exacerbates ALI via the NF-κB signaling pathway mediated by TLR2 and TLR4. [ 163 Brain HMGB1 exacerbates the occurrence and development of delayed neuroinflammation following ischemia by inducing the production of cytokines and promoting intercellular communication. HMGB1 leads to neuronal death, microglial activation, and exacerbated brain injury. Targeting HMGB1 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for sepsis-associated brain damage. [ 164 Notch Heart In the context of sepsis, the Notch signaling pathway influences endothelial cell fate by modulating angiogenesis, endothelial cell apoptosis, and vascular permeability. The ZFAS1/Notch signaling pathway is subject to regulation by the transcription factor Sp1, which ameliorates myocardial injury associated with sepsis. [ 165 Lung In sepsis, dysregulated activation of the Notch signaling pathway contributes to the regulation of alveolar epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, potentially leading to alveolar epithelial injury and exacerbating lung damage. γ-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) suppress Notch signaling, reducing alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, alleviating inflammatory cell infiltration, and mitigating lung injury in septic mice. [ 166 Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) Kidney TGF-β promotes fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis, which may lead to renal fibrosis and impair renal function. In a sepsis-induced mouse model of acute kidney injury, the transcription factor USF2 activates the TGF-β signaling pathway, thereby promoting pyroptosis and organ damage. Inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway alleviates fibrosis and protects renal function. [ 167 Wnt/β-catenin Kidney Upon organ injury, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated, which induces renal epithelial cell apoptosis and inflammatory responses during sepsis and exerts effects on cell tissue regeneration. Up-regulated expression of microRNA-23a-3p inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby suppressing cell apoptosis, reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and alleviating sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. [ 168 RAS/RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) Lung The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is a key component of the MAPK pathway. Inhibition of the ERK/NOX2 signaling pathway alleviates sepsis-induced lung injury. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway hold potential therapeutic value in sepsis treatment. [ 169 PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) Lung The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may regulate the immune function of neutrophils during sepsis by modulating processes such as glycolysis in these cells. Shenfu (SF) injection alleviates inflammatory responses, oxidative stress injury, and apoptosis by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby contributing to the improvement of acute respiratory distress syndrome in septic patients. [ 170 Heart Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway not only induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes but also exacerbates inflammatory responses, causing damage to the structure and function of the heart. Quercetin inhibits LPS-induced apoptosis, inflammatory responses, and ferroptosis. Knockdown of arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) synergistically suppresses these pathological processes, while ALOX5 overexpression counteracts the protective effect of quercetin against LPS-induced myocardial injury. [ 171 DNA-PKcs/cofilin2 Heart DNA-PKcs phosphorylates cofilin2 at Thr 25 Inhibition of DNA-PKcs or expression of phospho-defective cofilin2 ameliorates endothelial dysfunction and improves heart function in endotoxemic mice. [ 172 The aforementioned immune-related signaling pathways play a crucial role in immune modulation during sepsis, and their aberrant activation often triggers inflammatory reactions. The inflammatory response in sepsis is highly complex, involving interactions among various cells and molecules, closely associated with immune regulation. Below, we will delve into the inflammatory response in sepsis and its related signaling pathways. Inflammatory Response in Sepsis Sepsis-associated inflammatory response is mainly mediated by leukocytes. This response also involves a complex interaction among cytokines, ROS, endothelial cells, the complement system, and the coagulation system [ 71 72 73 74 75 MAPK signaling pathway MAPKs, as highly conserved serine/threonine kinases expressed in nucleated cells and platelets, have downstream apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family, which can activate downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K) upon stress stimulation [ 76 77 78 79 80 Considering the function of MAPK pathways in regulating inflammatory responses during sepsis, the targeted inhibition of these pathways emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy [ 81 82 83 HIF-1α signaling pathway Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to the development of MODS in septic patients. Vascular endothelial damage, cellular dysfunction, and activation of the coagulation system are among the key culprits. These factors interact in complex ways. Ultimately, they cause organ and tissue hypoperfusion, intravascular microthrombosis, and the failure of both macrocirculation and microcirculation [ 84 85 86 87 4 Fig. 4. The mechanism of action of HIF-1α in normoxia versus hypoxia inflammatory milieu characteristic of sepsis. In hypoxic environments, both the stability and activity of HIF-1α are increased, activating downstream signaling pathways that influence the regulation of inflammation, immune responses, and organ dysfunction. HIF-1α directly modulates the expression of inflammatory genes and interacts with the NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB, a pivotal inflammatory regulator, similarly plays a crucial role in sepsis. During the onset and progression of sepsis, the activation of NF-κB results in the excessive production of inflammatory mediators. (By Figdraw.) Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory response to infection. Blood monocytes, as the host’s initial line of defense, play a crucial role in this process. These cells can effectively detect invading pathogens and rapidly trigger an immune inflammatory response to effectively combat the infection [ 88 89 90 91 92 93 Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway The transcription factor Nrf2 belongs to the leucine zipper transcription factor family within the human Cap’n’Collar (CNC) domain [ 94 95 96 97 98 Currently, pharmacological agents aimed at the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway work via 2 mechanisms. Firstly, they enhance the accumulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. They do this by disrupting the binding between Nrf2 and Keap1 through oxidation, alkylation modification, or competitive binding. As a result, the body’s antioxidative stress response is augmented [ 99 100 101 102 Additional signaling pathways associated with inflammation in sepsis In addition to the signaling pathways implicated in immune regulation during sepsis, numerous other pathways are associated with the inflammatory response in this condition, extending beyond the aforementioned ones. These include the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, the inflammatory factor/cytokine pathway, and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, among others. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)–adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway represents a novel DNA-sensing mechanism that has been identified in recent years [ 103 104 In the context of sepsis, oxidative stress is exacerbated, and its products can inhibit PI3K activity, diminish Akt phosphorylation levels, and impair the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, ultimately leading to a reduction in the inflammatory response [ 105 106 107 2 Table 2. The role of inflammatory signaling pathways in sepsis-mediated organ damage Signaling pathways Organs Mechanism Effect of the intervention References HMGB1-RAGE Lung In the context of LPS-induced ALI, HMGB1 contributes to pathogenesis by activating the AIM2 inflammasome within macrophages and promoting M1 macrophage polarization through the TLR2, TLR4, and RAGE/NF-κB signaling pathways. Crataegin reduces histopathological damage and mortality in septic mice by inhibiting HMGB1 production. Additionally, its inhibitory effects on RAGE and TLR2/4 block the HMGB1-RAGE and HMGB1-TLR signaling pathways. [ 173 Liver Sepsis induces hepatocyte injury and promotes the massive release of HMGB1. Activation of the HMGB1-RAGE signaling pathway exacerbates hepatocyte pyroptosis and autophagy, thereby leading to further deterioration of liver function. Anti-HMGB1 antibodies or RAGE inhibitors alleviate hepatocyte injury and inflammatory responses. Resveratrol attenuates hepatocyte inflammatory responses by up-regulating SIRT1 expression to inhibit HMGB1 release and nucleocytoplasmic translocation. [ 174 Wnt/β-catenin Kidney In acute kidney injury, transient activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway promotes tissue regeneration and repair. Conversely, prolonged activation leads to renal tubular epithelial cell damage, thereby inducing renal fibrosis, inflammation, and kidney injury. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway promotes tissue regeneration and renal function recovery in AKI. However, its prolonged activation in CKD exacerbates tubular injury, fibrosis, and inflammation. Interactions between Wnt/β-catenin and pathways such as Notch provide new directions for combined interventions in kidney diseases. [ 175 Heart Inflammatory responses associated with sepsis activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, triggering the activation of downstream target genes including NF-κB. This process promotes myocardial cell hypertrophy, apoptosis, and dysfunction, ultimately leading to impaired cardiac function. In a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated in both cardiac and renal tissues. Inhibition of this pathway has been shown to improve tissue damage in both organs. [ 176 Autophagy Heart In the early stage of sepsis, autophagy exerts a protective effect by clearing damaged components, while excessive autophagy in the late stage induces apoptosis and tissue damage. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can enhance autophagic activity, inhibit apoptosis, and maintain myocardial function. Drugs such as dapagliflozin can improve sepsis-induced cardiac injury by regulating signaling pathways including autophagy and PI3K/Akt. [ 177 Lung In sepsis, reduced autophagy impairs the clearance of damaged cellular components and inflammatory mediators, thereby leading to exacerbated inflammatory responses and lung tissue damage. Enhancing lysosomal acidification and restoring autophagy can mitigate lung injury and improve the survival rate of septic mice. Autophagy inducers like rapamycin can reduce cellular damage, inflammatory responses, and sepsis-associated lung injury. [ 178 Kidney Autophagy inhibits the activation of inflammasomes by promoting the degradation of damaged mitochondria and lysosomes, thereby reducing the release of DAMPs. Activation of autophagy can alleviate sepsis-induced renal injury. Therefore, targeting autophagy may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for managing sepsis-associated renal injury. [ 179 Ang-II Heart In sepsis, angiotensin II activates the NF-κB pathway via AT1 receptors, with its mediated inflammation and oxidative stress exacerbating myocardial injury. Meanwhile, vasoconstriction induces myocardial remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce inflammation, inhibit fibrosis, maintain myocardial function, and enhance cardiac contractility. [ 180 Kidney Sepsis can activate the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), promoting increased production of angiotensin II (Ang-II), exacerbating vasoconstriction and renal hypoperfusion, and ultimately leading to renal ischemic injury. The use of RAAS antagonists, particularly ACE inhibitors and ARBs, can reduce renal tissue injury and the incidence of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. [ 181 Liver Angiotensin II exacerbates septic hepatocyte injury and dysfunction by promoting inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. It also causes hepatic vasoconstriction, worsening ischemia and hypoxia to further impair liver function. Additionally, angiotensin II inhibits bile secretion, leading to cholestasis and additional liver damage. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis when mean arterial pressure cannot be maintained with conventional vasopressors, angiotensin II may serve as a potential adjunctive resuscitative agent. [ 182 NLRP3 inflammasomes Heart Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to myocardial cell injury and dysfunction. It may also activate apoptosis-related proteins such as caspase-3 to induce myocardial cell apoptosis. Chrysophanol reduces inflammation and myocardial pyroptosis by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome in septic mice. [ 183 The inflammatory response in sepsis exerts extensive effects on the body through various signaling pathways, and the persistence of inflammation can further lead to cellular dysfunction. Mitochondria, as crucial organelles within cells, are highly susceptible to impairment during the pathogenesis of sepsis. We will now explore the relevant mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis. Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Sepsis Mitochondria are the primary energy generators within cells, and they are key regulators of cellular apoptosis and immune responses [ 108 109 110 111 Impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics Sepsis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction often leads to impaired bioenergetics. This impairment occurs because excessive production of ROS and inflammatory mediators damages mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and membranes [ 112 113 114 115 Role of mitochondrial ROS in sepsis Mitochondrial metabolism is a source of ROS. Optimal levels of ROS are essential for cellular signaling and host defense mechanisms. During sepsis, the dysregulation of mitochondrial ROS production results in the malfunctioning of the intracellular antioxidant system. This dysfunction contributes to oxidative damage to cellular components and exacerbates the inflammatory response [ 116 117 118 119 Mitochondria-induced apoptosis and its impact on sepsis progression Autophagy is a cellular response to nutrient depletion or stress. It enables the recycling of cellular components, producing amino acids and fatty acids. These substances can then be metabolized and used in OXPHOS [ 120 121 122 123 Mitochondrial damage induces lymphocyte apoptosis, a characteristic feature of sepsis-induced immunosuppression, while NF-κB has been shown to promote mitophagy through the up-regulation of the autophagy receptor p62. This works as a self-regulatory mechanism to mitigate excessive inflammation and preserve homeostasis [ 124 5 Fig. 5. Sepsis and mitochondrial quality control mechanisms. Mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, rely on tightly regulated mechanisms to maintain their function. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO), a critical energy-generating pathway in mitochondria, is inhibited during sepsis to lead to insufficient energy production. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which stabilizes and regulates mitochondrial DNA transcription, is essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance. However, in sepsis, TFAM expression and function may be impaired, negatively affecting mitochondrial biogenesis. Additionally, nuclear respiratory factor (NRF), a key transcription factor for mitochondrial biogenesis, is activated by PGC-1α, a master regulator of energy metabolism. PGC-1α enhances NRF activity, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS in response to energy demands. During sepsis, reduced PGC-1α expression and activity lead to diminished mitochondrial biogenesis, which worsens mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular impairment. (By Figdraw.) In summary, mitochondrial dysfunction is key to sepsis pathophysiology, causing energy failure, oxidative stress, and cell death. Grasping these mechanisms is vital for creating therapies to maintain mitochondrial function, reduce inflammation, and enhance clinical outcomes. Future research ought to prioritize the identification of specific molecular targets within mitochondria that are optimally suited for therapeutic interventions. Additionally, efforts should be directed toward developing strategies that can be rapidly translated into clinical practice to benefit patients suffering from sepsis. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the development of sepsis, affecting not only cellular energy supply and apoptosis but also being closely related to metabolic changes in sepsis. Metabolic reprogramming is a characteristic of sepsis, interacting with mitochondrial dysfunction to collectively influence the progression of sepsis. The following section will provide a detailed exploration of the multifaceted aspects of metabolic reprogramming in sepsis. Metabolic Reprogramming in Sepsis Metabolic reprogramming refers to the process by which cells, under specific physiological or pathological conditions, adjust their metabolic pathways and the utilization of metabolites to adapt to environmental changes or achieve certain functions. This process encompasses a variety of metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, OXPHOS, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, metabolic reprogramming also involves the redistribution of metabolic intermediates and the regulation of metabolite signaling pathways [ 125 126 127 109 128 Understanding key signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and HIF-1α’s impact on glycolysis in metabolic reprogramming offers insights for therapeutic strategies to restore metabolic balance and improve patient outcomes [ 129 d 130 131 132 PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway participates in the regulation of cellular metabolism, growth, and survival [ 133 134 135 136 137 138 Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway emerges as a promising therapeutic approach to modulate the immune response and improve organ protection in sepsis [ 139 140 141 + 142 HIF-1α and metabolic reprogramming HIF-1α orchestrates the transition from OXPHOS to glycolysis in response to hypoxic conditions, frequently observed in septic tissues [ 93 143 144 The up-regulation of glycolytic activity mediated by HIF-1α in sepsis not only fulfills the immediate energy demands of immune cells but also has the capacity to influence the overall systemic metabolic milieu [ 145 146 147 Modulating the activity of HIF-1α presents a promising therapeutic strategy for sepsis. Inhibition of HIF-1α can mitigate pathological glycolytic translocation and its related metabolic complications, thereby reducing tissue damage and enhancing organ function [ 148 149 150 In conclusion, metabolic reprogramming is a crucial component of sepsis, exerting a profound impact on disease progression and patient prognosis. By targeting key pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and HIF-1α, and integrating the role of the microbiome, more effective and personalized treatment strategies can be formulated to address the complex metabolic challenges associated with sepsis. In the future, it is possible to deeply analyze the molecular mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming in immune cells and systematically elucidate the changes in metabolic phenotypes of different immune cell subsets during sepsis, providing a theoretical basis for innovative treatment strategies. Researchers can also commit to conducting large-scale, multi-center clinical trials to validate the findings of basic research and explore new biomarkers. Meanwhile, the use of advanced technologies such as machine learning to analyze patients’ clinical data may help identify heterogeneous phenotypes of sepsis and promote the development of precision medicine. In addition, by strengthening the cooperation between basic research and clinical practice, the development and clinical application of new drugs and treatment strategies can be promoted, and the therapeutic effect of sepsis can be improved. With a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of sepsis, more effective preventive and treatment strategies are expected to be achieved in the future, fundamentally improving the prognosis of sepsis patients. The Prospect of Targeted Therapy Current limitations in sepsis management have highlighted the critical need to investigate the underlying signaling pathways involved in its pathophysiology, offering potential avenues for the development of more effective interventions. Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulation of systemic immunity, encompassing both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory responses. Targeting signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt, has the potential to modulate immune cell function, restore immune equilibrium, and suppress excessive inflammatory responses [ 151 152 Numerous challenges remain before research on sepsis can be effectively translated into clinically viable treatment options. From a pathogenesis perspective, sepsis encompasses multiple signaling pathways that interact to establish a complex regulatory network [ 153 154 155 3 Table 3. Therapeutic agents and impacts on sepsis-related signaling pathways Signaling pathway Pharmacological interventions Mechanism Use in the context of sepsis Effects References 3PO (PFKFB3 inhibitor) 3PO inhibits PFKFB3, a glycolytic activator, thereby suppressing LPS-induced NF-κB-p65 nuclear translocation, reducing endothelial cell glycolysis, inflammation, and permeability, and alleviating ALI. It is utilized to inhibit the activity of the NF-κB signaling pathway, attenuating the inflammatory response associated with sepsis and treating ALI induced by sepsis. It attenuates the inflammatory response of the vascular endothelium and confers protection to mice against LPS-induced ALI. [ 184 Angiotensin-(1–7) Angiotensin-(1–7) inhibits the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, diminishes ROS production, mitigates oxidative stress, and alleviates inflammatory responses. It ameliorates mitochondrial structure and function in cardiomyocytes and suppresses cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Regulate the balance of the RAAS and decrease Ang-II levels; sustain the mitochondrial energy supply in cardiomyocytes, inhibit apoptosis in these cells, and mitigate myocardial damage. By reducing myocardial tissue inflammation, inhibiting cellular infiltration, and alleviating oxidative stress, the severity of SIC can be decreased. [ 185 Curcumin Curcumin inhibits the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, suppressing the expression of downstream inflammatory mediators and mitigating tissue damage associated with sepsis. Curcumin exerted a protective effect against sepsis-induced kidney injury, attenuated inflammatory responses and apoptotic processes, and improved renal function parameters. Decrease serum concentrations of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and cystatin C (Cys-C) in murine models of sepsis. [ 186 Wnt/β-catenin HOXA cluster antisense RNA 2 (HOXA-AS2) analogs or agonists The up-regulation of long noncoding RNA HOXA-AS2 can inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby reducing damage to renal tubular epithelial cells. It can be used in treating AKI induced by sepsis. It can mitigate damage to renal tubular epithelial cells and preserve kidney function while reducing inflammation and enhancing sepsis patients’ survival. [ 187 siRNA or β-catenin inhibitors β-catenin can drive the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, while its inhibitors reduce the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC by blocking this mechanism, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response. In the treatment of sepsis patients, particularly those exhibiting an excessive inflammatory response, β-catenin inhibitors have been shown to attenuate LPS-induced systemic inflammation. β-Catenin inhibitors can mitigate LPS-induced systemic inflammation. [ 188 Notch Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) DAPT, a Notch signaling pathway inhibitor, can suppress ACE activity, reduce Ang-II production, and alleviate damage to vascular endothelial cells. It can mitigate vascular endothelial cell damage and ameliorate endothelial dysfunction induced by sepsis. DAPT can alleviate damage to pulmonary vascular endothelial cells by inhibiting Ang-II production, thereby exerting a protective effect against sepsis-induced lung injury. [ 189 PI3K/Akt Huanglian Jiedu decoction (a traditional herbal formulation) Quercetin, the main active ingredient in Huanglian Jiedu decoction, can reduce ROS levels in the lung tissue of septic rats, decrease HMGB1 expression, and inhibit the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby protecting against sepsis-induced lung injury. Huanglian Jiedu decoction is used in clinical practice for the treatment of sepsis, demonstrating notable therapeutic efficacy. It can reduce inflammation, reduce organ damage, and improve survival in patients with sepsis. [ 190 TGF-β Dexmedetomidine Dexmedetomidine prevents TGF-β1-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the JNK signaling pathway.

[ 191 MAPK Fisetin Fisetin has been shown to mitigate renal inflammation and apoptosis, preserving organ function in murine models of septic AKI. This protective effect is achieved through the inhibition of the Src-mediated NF-κB p65 and MAPK signaling pathways. Fisetin can mitigate renal inflammation and apoptosis, enhancing survival of mice with LPS-induced septic AKI. It can decrease inflammation and tissue damage in septic animals, enhancing survival. Fisetin might also weaken the immune response, raising the risk of infection. [ 192 TLR Berberine Berberine binds to the TLR4/MD-2 receptor and inhibits LPS-induced activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway. Berberine can reduce LPS-induced intestinal permeability increase and inflammatory response, and alleviate sepsis-induced MODS. Berberine can inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators, protect the intestinal barrier, reduce lung and myocardial injury, and decrease the mortality rate in sepsis models. [ 193 Nano-curcumin Nano-curcumin alleviates sepsis-related inflammatory responses by inhibiting the TLR4 signaling pathway. The prognosis of patients with severe sepsis in the intensive care unit may be enhanced. Nano-curcumin supplementation has the potential to attenuate inflammatory biomarkers and oxidative stress indices, as well as enhance endothelial function in critically ill patients with sepsis. [ 194 Autophagy and apoptosis Emodin Emodin facilitates the activation of the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway, enhancing autophagy, inhibiting apoptosis, and mitigating inflammatory responses. Enhances cognitive function and mitigates hippocampal neuronal damage. This process not only reduces inflammation, inhibits apoptosis, and promotes autophagy but also facilitates cellular repair and improves organ function. The application of emodin in the management of sepsis predominantly targets SAE. [ 195 Quercetin Quercetin, as a SIRT1 deacetylase activator, promotes the deacetylation of p53, which helps its nuclear retention and activation of autophagy. This mechanism contributes to alleviating sepsis-related acute kidney injury. Quercetin alleviates renal injury in CLP-induced septic mice, manifested as reduced levels of renal injury biomarkers including kidney injury molecule-1 and Scr, and improved renal function. Quercetin exhibits limited bioavailability, which requires elevated dosages to attain therapeutic efficacy. [ 196 Pyroptosis Diulfiram Disulfiram can inhibit gasdermin D pore formation, down-modulating pyroptosis and the release of inflammatory factors. Disulfiram is approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence and is anticipated to enhance the prognosis of sepsis by inhibiting the pyroptosis signaling pathway. In a mouse sepsis model, disulfide effectively reduced mortality and decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF, and IL-6 in serum. [ 197 Buformin Buformin can enhance autophagy and up-regulate Nrf2 protein levels via AMPK-dependent pathways. This modulation inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, preventing pyroptosis and mitigating lung inflammation and tissue damage. When evaluating the efficacy and safety of buformin in sepsis, rigorous clinical trials are still required. It inhibits the expression of NLRP3-related proteins and alleviates sepsis-induced ALI. [ 198 Ferroptosis Uridine Uridine activates the Nrf2 pathway, promotes the expression of antioxidant genes, and reduces ACSL4, thereby helping to prevent ferroptosis, alleviate inflammatory responses, and mitigate oxidative stress. Uridine can mitigate sepsis-induced ALI and ameliorate lung damage, inflammatory responses, tissue iron levels, and lipid peroxidation. Uridine is a natural substance. It affects multiple signaling pathways for various therapeutic benefits. [ 199 Sepsis is a complex disease involving multiple biological pathways, and targeted therapy has become a key strategy to optimize its management. Bioinformatics technologies have demonstrated substantial application value in the exploration of targeted therapies for sepsis. For instance, a study using network pharmacology analysis found that heparin may act on multiple targets related to immune regulation and coagulation function, providing a new perspective for targeted sepsis therapy. Further molecular dynamics simulations validated the binding stability and affinity of heparin with these targets, laying a theoretical foundation for the development of heparin-based targeted treatment strategies [ 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 Targeted therapy for sepsis has made remarkable progress over the past few years, with these emerging approaches providing new perspectives and possibilities for improving sepsis diagnosis and treatment. However, despite the potential benefits of these therapeutic strategies, caution is still required in clinical application, particularly in balancing perspectives and findings across different studies. Future efforts may focus on the discovery of new targets and the exploration of multi-target combination therapy strategies. Sepsis is not caused by a single etiology but rather involves multiple biological pathways; thus, identifying new therapeutic targets and adopting multi-target combination therapy will be important directions for future research. By integrating diverse treatment modalities, future sepsis therapy will become more precise, tailored to individual patient needs, enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing mortality. This requires not only continuous advancements in basic research but also clinical trial validation to verify the effectiveness and safety of these new strategies, ultimately offering new possibilities for improving patient outcomes. Future Directions and Conclusion Sepsis represents a major global health challenge. It is characterized by dysregulated immune response, metabolic disturbances, and organ dysfunction, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel and more efficacious therapeutic interventions. Despite ongoing research efforts, substantial challenges persist within the existing literature regarding the understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and the identification of effective targets for treatment strategies. Although substantial progress has been made in studying sepsis signaling pathways, we still lack a deep understanding of how these pathways interact with each other and what specific roles they play at different pathological stages. Thus, future research should examine the alterations in various signaling pathways and evaluate their specific roles at each stage of sepsis progression. This approach will facilitate the precise identification of intervention windows and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. This includes the potential for timely modulation of these pathways within the immune response to sepsis, ideally achieving control and resolution of systemic infections prior to the onset of a cytokine storm. A major challenge in sepsis research is the translation of knowledge acquired using preclinical models into clinical practice. Genetic factors, individual variability, and disparities in immune system backgrounds greatly influence the progression and prognosis of sepsis in patients, thereby complicating the application of a uniform treatment regimen. Insufficient human studies on sepsis have been conducted. Therefore, there is an urgent need for personalized therapeutic strategies in the diagnosis and management of sepsis. Future research should give priority to identifying and screening sepsis-related biomarkers and developing personalized intervention strategies. This will help improve the specificity and effectiveness of treatment methods. Current treatment models often ignore the heterogeneity of sepsis. They tend to use a standardized treatment approach, which may not work well for all patients due to individual differences. Future efforts should focus on the identification of specific markers within the signaling pathway, enabling the stratification of patients according to their unique pathophysiological characteristics. These biomarkers have the potential to inform personalized treatment strategies, facilitate the early identification of high-risk sepsis patients, and promote timely interventions. This approach would allow clinicians to tailor therapeutic interventions to address specific dysregulations in signaling pathways or distinct metabolic profiles. In summary, a thorough understanding of the signaling pathways in sepsis is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Future research can focus on several key areas: first, elucidating the complex interactions between sepsis-related signaling pathways; second, developing innovative combination therapies targeting multiple signaling pathways; and third, establishing novel immune monitoring indicators. A comprehensive understanding of the intricate signaling pathway network in sepsis is essential for identifying new targets that have the potential to improve patient outcomes. Despite the progress made in sepsis research, many challenges remain. Advancing in these research directions holds promise for bringing new breakthroughs to the clinical treatment of sepsis, thereby improving patient survival rates and quality of life.
