Introduction Over the last forty years, organic electronics has made enormous progress, developing from a niche field of study to a well-known and lucrative technology [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 The field of organic bioelectronics is significantly progressing towards the creation of seamless, adaptable, and smart interfaces with biological systems [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 Figure 1 26 Because of their versatility, simplicity of use with live organisms, and smooth, undisturbed integration with biological systems, electronic devices based on organic/polymer semiconductors are perfect for biomedical applications. This facilitates the development of novel solutions in the fields of healthcare, diagnostics, and brain interface [ 27 28 2. Diversity of Organic Electronics The diversity of organic/polymer electronics originates from a broad spectrum of customizable carbon-based semiconducting materials, which may be engineered to be flexible, elastic, biodegradable, or biocompatible [ 29 15 2.1. Diversity of Materials The fundamental advantage of organic electronics lies in its varied and versatile material foundation. This encompasses conductive polymers utilized for electrodes and as well as semiconducting compounds employed in active device components. These materials exhibit significant tunability, allowing for precise engineering of their properties at the molecular level for targeted applications, including flexible displays and biocompatible sensors [ 30 2.2. Diversity of Functionalities The capabilities of organic electronic materials rise above just conduction. A significant characteristic is their capacity to be designed for specific functions, making them particularly appropriate for advanced applications. Many materials function as mixed conductors, facilitating the transport of both electrons and ions, which is crucial for interfacing with biological systems such as nerves. Additional materials exhibit electrochromic properties, enabling color change on demand for smart windows, or electroactive characteristics, allowing movement and shapeshifting to function as artificial muscles. Moreover, their chemical properties facilitate the design of (bio)degradable materials, which can be utilized in medical implants that safely dissolve within the body, thereby avoiding the necessity for surgical removal [ 31 32 2.3. Diversity of Fabrication Techniques Unlike conventional silicon chips that require production in costly multi-billion-dollar foundries, organic electronics are characterized by their compatibility with low-cost and simple manufacturing techniques [ 33 34 35 2.4. Diversity of Form Factors The above-mentioned innovative and diverse processing enables the creation of devices that noticeably differ from traditional, rigid structures. Organic electronics can be engineered to demonstrate flexibility and stretchability, allowing for bending, folding, and resistance to compression. Furthermore, they can be produced to be ultra-thin and lightweight, possibly leading to numerous imperceptible bioelectronic applications. That opens the door to totally novel form factors and uses that were not even possible before [ 35 36 2.5. Diversity of Applications, Specifically in Bioelectronics Numerous cutting-edge medical applications are made possible by the combination of various organic electronic materials and devices.

Furthermore, these technologies are enhancing tissue engineering and advanced prosthetics by providing electrical stimulation for regeneration and enabling realistic movement and feeling [ 36 37 38 3. Key Aspects of Organic Bioelectronics Utilizing the unique properties of organic semiconducting materials, organic bioelectronics enables seamless communication with biological processes [ 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 (1) Biocompatibility: This is the most important characteristic of organic bioelectronics.

Many conducting polymers and natural polymers—organic materials—have excellent biocompatibility, reducing the likelihood of adverse responses or tissue injury, as shown in Figure 2 Figure 2 52 4. Applications for Organic Bioelectronics Bioelectricity is an inherent characteristic of all living organisms because charge carrier gradients generate currents and voltages [ 53 54 55 56 Figure 3 The biocompatibility of several organic semiconductors, including PEDOT:PSS, enables their direct integration into biological output systems such as enzymes and cells, hence enhancing effective biotic-abiotic communication. The diverse electronic and optical characteristics of organic semiconductors make them highly appropriate for various biosensor types, such as electrolyte-gated organic field-effect transistors and organic electrochemical transistors for electronic sensing, as well as active layers in optoelectronic systems for optical detection. Their ability for low-temperature processing and compatibility with flexible substrates facilitates the creation of innovative automated components and wearable designs. Thus, organic semiconductors function as optimal transducer materials, proficiently transforming a biological stimulation into an amplified and processable electrical or optical signal, so connecting biological recognition with data collecting, processing, and presentation. Three critical steps are involved in the biosensor’s operation as shown in Figure 3 57 Thus, organic bioelectronic devices have a broad range of intriguing applications, such as (1) Organic bioelectronic devices improve neurological sensing and stimulation, peri-prosthetics, brain–computer interfaces, drug delivery, and treatments for a range of brain disorders by tracking, promoting, and controlling cerebral (brain) activity [ 28 58 59 (2) The flexibility and adaptability of organic bioelectronic devices facilitate the development of soft neural interfaces that could be implanted into the brain and nervous system to improve integration [ 60 (3) Organic bioelectronic retina implantation provides sophisticated, compact, non-intrusive devices by using the tunable electrical and optical properties of organic semiconductors. For patients with retinal degenerative illnesses, these devices may interact with the delicate retinal tissue and partially restore vision [ 61 (4) Small semiconducting materials are now being investigated by researchers for usage in organic bioelectronic devices for a range of cardiac applications. These include tissue engineering scaffolds that can efficiently monitor and regulate cardiac activity via connections to the heart, pacemakers, and cardiac defibrillators. Furthermore, these devices may be very beneficial for tissue regeneration and repair [ 62 (5) Bone tissue engineering would make use of organic bioelectronic materials. These elements have shown potential in increasing bone cell development, activating bone cells, and permitting targeted medication release. This might be useful for the regeneration and repair of damaged or diseased bone structures [ 63 (6) Biosensors that are very sensitive and selective may be designed using organic electrical components. Numerous metabolites, physiological signals, and biomarkers may be detected using these biosensors [ 49 (7) Continuous, real-time monitoring of health indicators is possible with integrated biosensing devices, which may help with early illness detection and personalized treatment [ 64 (8) Organic bioelectronic materials may be active ingredients, substrates, or frameworks in tissue engineering that aid in the growth, differentiation, or regeneration of sick or damaged tissues [ 65 (9) It may be possible to create organic bioelectronic devices that would allow the localized release of therapeutic chemicals in response to external triggers or biological signals, allowing for precise and targeted drug delivery [ 66 (10) Organic bioelectronic materials may perform a variety of functions, including drug release, actuation, and sensing, all within a single system. This enables the development of tailored and adaptable therapeutic approaches [ 67 (11) Adding electrical signaling and stimulation to these organ-based systems may promote tissue growth and repair [ 68 (12) Prosthetic limbs, exoskeletons, and various other assistive technologies are examples of organic bioelectrical devices that may improve movement, sensory feedback, and the connection between people and electronics [ 69 (13) The compatibility and biomimetic design of organic bioelectronics may enhance these assistive devices’ usability, comfort, and user experience [ 70 71 As an example Figure 4 72 The biological components are hierarchically structured and include tissues and organs (e.g., neurons that transmit electrical signals analogous to electronic circuits), microbial entities (viruses and bacteria), and cellular constituents (antibodies, digestive enzymes, nucleotides, and metabolites such as lactate). Conjugated organic/polymers are essential to this integration because of their flexible, processable, and biocompatible qualities, which allow for dual ion-electron conductance and applications in actuation treatment and soft bio interfaces. Conversely, the electronic domain replicates biological transport of ions and synaptic plasticity with sophisticated devices like memristors and ion pumps, as well as simple components like electrodes and transistors (channel, source, and drain). Neurological interfaces, biosensors, bioelectronic medical practice, and neural computing are examples of biohybrid technologies, which integrate biological and artificial systems via the use of conductive polymers and electronic components. This framework advances our knowledge of bioelectronic integration and aids in the creation of novel therapeutic and diagnostic instruments by using the special qualities of both biological and electronic materials to connect live things with designated equipment [ 71 72 Table 1 5. Organic Semiconducting Materials for Bioelectronics In organic semiconductors, electric charge is moved through the combination of hopping with space-charge-limited current (SCLC) processes [ 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 62 93 94 95 19 96 97 98 99 100 5.1. Conjugate Polymer A comparative summary of the main characteristics, advantages, drawbacks, and uses of well-known conducting polymers is given in Table 2 −1 101 102 Conductive polymeric materials are essential to organic technologies because they facilitate the movement of both ions and electrons. They also serve as a conduit between biological organisms and computer instruments. One of the most adaptable conductive polymers, PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) has numerous uses in a variety of fields, including organic light emitting diodes [ 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 51 102 120 121 122 biosensors-15-00587-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Electrical Conductivity, Benefits Limitations, and Applications of Conductive Polymers for Bioelectronics: Polypyrrole (PPy), Polyaniline (PANi), Polythiophene (PT), PEDOT, and PPV.

For sensor, bioimaging, and biosensing applications—especially in monitoring and diagnostics within the healthcare sector—they are indispensable instruments [ 146 5.2. Natural Polymer Natural polymers have generated a lot of interest in bioelectronic applications due to their intrinsic biocompatibility, flexibility, biodegradability, and capacity to interact with biological systems. Chitosan, collagen, and silk are being studied extensively as polymers because of their potential use in tissue engineering, brain interactions, biosensors, and systems for delivering drugs. This may be explained by their high conductivity, capacity to connect with living cells and tissues, and ability to provide support [ 71 147 148 149 150 5.2.1. Chitosan Chitosan is a biodegradable and organic polymer with special properties that make it perfect for use in organic bio-electronics. Because it may vary to show electrical and ionic conductivity, it is suitable for application in brain interfaces, biosensors, and organic electrochemical transistors [ 151 152 153 2 154 5.2.2. Collagen Collagen is a protein that exists in nature and is found in the extracellular matrix. It has remarkable biocompatibility and may enhance electrical communication between biological entities and electronic systems. Collagen has special qualities that make it a desirable material for the development of sophisticated brain interfaces, tissue-engineered structures, and other bioelectronic devices that must interact with the human body in an elegant manner. These characteristics include its unique structure, electrical conductivity, and capability to promote cell proliferation and tissue regeneration [ 155 156 5.3. Silk Silk, a biomaterial derived from silkworms, is a naturally occurring protein-based polymer that has enormous promise for a variety of bioelectronic applications. Silk’s unique mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability make it an attractive material for the development of flexible, adaptable, and implantable bioelectronic systems. These technologies may be used in a variety of sectors, including as brain cell interfaces, tissue engineering, and wearable medical surveillance systems, and they integrate easily with the human body [ 157 Due to their distinct structural, electrical, and biocompatible qualities, a number of naturally occurring organic materials, including gelatine [ 158 159 160 161 162 5.4. Graphene Researchers have actively examined graphene as a possible material for brain interfaces, biosensors, and scaffolding for tissue engineering, with a particular focus on organic bioelectronics [ 163 164 For better glucose biosensing, Alwarappan et al. used enzyme-doped graphene nanosheets [ 165 166 167 Table 3 5.5. Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Carbon nanotubes are excellent for the application in organic bioelectronics technologies due to their light weight, high electrical conductivity, broad surface-to-volume ratio, and excellent biocompatibility. When encompassed into organic electronic devices and interfaces, carbon nanotubes may enhance electric charge mobility, signal transmission, and connectivity between electronics and biological systems [ 211 212 213 214 212 Conducting polymers have been combined with other organic and inorganic elements, such as carbon nanotubes and ceramics, to create sophisticated composite materials with enhanced mechanical, electrical, and biological capabilities. Hybrid systems expand the potential of organic bioelectronics by enabling the creation of very versatile and flexible systems that can easily communicate with biological systems [ 215 6. Organic Bioelectronic Devices There are innovative uses for organic bioelectronic devices in the fields of rehabilitation, regenerative medicine, and general medicine. Prescription delivery devices, brain user interfaces, tissue engineering frameworks, and wearable sensors are a few applications. 6.1. Core Device Architectures 6.1.1. Organic Electrochemical Transistors (OECTs) Originally developed by White’s team in 1984, the organic thin film transistor is also known as the organic electrochemical transistor. Because of its remarkable water stability, it has lately attracted attention and is appropriate for use in biological sciences [ 216 44 Conducting organic/polymer’s channel conductivity is regulated by an organic electrochemical transistor via electrochemical interactions. The semiconductor of the OECT device serves as the channel and is often made of conjugated organic/polymers (e.g., PEDOT:PSS). A non-polarizable Ag/AgCl or similar kind of electrode is integrated into a gate electrode that is interacting with an electrolyte solution [ 176 217 218 219 GS DS 201 220 221 222 The function of OECT is determined by the interplay of charge and ion transport, which modulates the current (I DS 223 (1) g m = ∂ I D ∂ V G = W d L μ n C * V t h − V G The active layer’s carrier mobility, volume capacitance, and OECT threshold voltage are represented by m, C*, and Vth in the equation above, while W, L, and d stand for the channel’s width, length, and thickness, respectively. OECTs’ gate, channel, and electrolytes have been functionally modified to increase their transconductance (g m 224 225 2 158 226 227 183 228 229 Figure 5 230 Table 4 −1 −1 −1 −1 6.1.2. Organic Electrochemical Sensors The biosensors industry is now valued at hundreds of billions of dollars all over the world. Significant growth in this area is being driven by developments in organic bioelectronics and their applications in manufacturing processes, environmental monitoring, healthcare, and other fields [ 91 248 The OECTs, which take use of organic semiconductors’ ability to convert ions into electrons, are the basic building blocks of organic electrochemical sensors. An OECT-based sensor interacts with the organic semiconducting material in order to regulate the electrical characteristics of the transistor, like voltage or current, using an analyte, such as a particular molecule or ion. Finding the target analyte’s existence or concentration will aid in the identification and correlation. Organic bioelectronic sensors may be categorized in a number of ways. A few of them are listed below. (1) Enzymatic biosensor, using enzymes as the biological recognition component, enzymatic biosensors detect and measure certain substances, such as glucose [ 249 250 251 (2) Immunosensors, biosensors that identify and measure certain biomarkers or antigens using antibodies or antibody fragments [ 252 (3) DNA/Geno sensors, also known as biosensors, use nucleic acid probes, such as DNA or RNA, to monitor genetic sequences or mutations [ 253 (4) Entire-cell biosensors use entire living cells, such as bacteria, algae, or mammalian cells, as the biological component to detect a variety of analytes or environmental changes [ 254 (5) Tissue-based biosensors detect and measure toxins, medications, or other compounds using slices or cultures of biological cells, such as muscle or liver [ 255 (6) Aptamer-based biosensors employ single-stranded DNA or RNA aptamers as the identification component to accurately and highly specifically detect various target substances [ 256 (7) Microbial biosensors use microorganisms, such as bacteria or yeast, to detect and respond to certain environmental conditions or the existence of target substances [ 257 (8) Photonic biosensors: These biosensors use optical methods, such as surface plasmon resonance or fluorescence, to identify and measure biomolecular interactions [ 258 (9) Using electrochemical methods such as amperometry, potentiometry, or impedance spectroscopy, biosensors detect and quantify targeted analytes [ 259 260 (10) Using the piezoelectric characteristics of materials like polymer films or quartz crystals, piezoelectric biosensors detect and quantify mass changes brought on by biomolecular interactions [ 261 6.1.3. Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) for Optogenetics The solid-state lighting technology, known as organic light-emitting diodes, can produce light that is precisely localized. This makes them suitable for optogenetic applications. The approach of optogenetics involves using light-sensitive proteins, such as channel rhodopsins, to change the behavior of certain cells or tissues in living creatures [ 262 263 Figure 6 3 2 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 264 In optogenetics, OLEDs provide spatial control by enabling the customization of their shapes and sizes to precisely target regions or cell concentrations inside a sample or organism. Because OLEDs have a high switching speed, light emission may be precisely timed, giving temporal control. Effective optical stimulation of photosensitive proteins is facilitated by this characteristic. Multimodal integration refers to the ability of OLEDs to be coupled with other functional elements, such electrodes or sensors. This combination makes it possible to utilize visual stimulation and electrical/chemical recordings from the selected cells or tissues at the same time. When organic materials used in OLEDs are designed to be biocompatible, the possibility of adverse consequences upon implantation or when they are connected to biological systems is decreased. OLEDs are essential for reducing power consumption and heat production in in vivo optogenetic systems because they can achieve very high power efficiency [ 265 266 Empirical research has shown that organic light-emitting diodes may be used in a variety of optogenetic settings. Using organic light-emitting diodes, researchers have effectively regulated neuronal activity by optically stimulating neurons in preparations of brain slices and cell cultures [ 267 268 269 270 271 264 272 6.1.4. Stimulus and Organic Bioelectronic Actuators and Generators In order to convert electrical signals into mechanical movement or deformation, organic bioelectronic systems rely heavily on organic actuators. This enables the devices to react to biological systems in a dynamic and intelligent manner. Hydrogels and other bioactuators are made of organic materials that may be controlled by external stimuli. These stimuli include changes in light, humidity, pH, redox state, current, magnetic fields, and temperature. By drastically altering volume or phase, the bio actuators may exhibit reversible swelling or shrinking behavior when these stimuli are applied and modified [ 42 273 274 275 276 277 To create pulse trains that replicate the nervous system’s function, the Bao research team constructed a signal conditioning circuit system on a skin-like patch. With a driving voltage of less than ±5 V, this patch could represent the typical sensory process [ 278 Bao and associates used soft, elastic hydrogel to develop a microelectronic device. They achieved this by replacing the ionic liquid component of PEDOT:PSS with an elastic fluorinated photoresist and used water as the passivation layer. In a mouse model, the micropatterned conducting hydrogel electrode exhibited little inflammatory tissue reaction and mechanical properties suitable with the nerve, with a Young’s modulus of 32 kPa [ 279 6.2. Functional Materia Plateform 6.2.1. Organic Hydrogels For the advancement of bioelectronics, the role of organic hydrogels is crucial. Water-filled polymer networks compose these flexible materials, mimicking the extracellular matrix of living organisms [ 42 280 There are several ways that hydrogel might help bioelectronics progress. Hydrogels are also a good match for implanted bioelectronic devices since they are biocompatible and conform to biological tissues [ 281 282 283 The injectable conductive polymer hydrogels are a novel class of biomaterials with enormous promise for use in organic bioelectronic applications. Injectable polymer-based hydrogels have considerable potential for treating various tissue ailments, such as injury to the heart, nerves, and skeletal muscles [ 284 285 286 287 The polymers are joined to form a wet, malleable, and porous structure. These hydrogels have the ability to convert electrical impulses effectively. Syk 2006 attributes this to the polymer backbone’s inherent electrical conductivity. Furthermore, these hydrogels possess mechanical properties comparable to those of biological tissues because of their high water content and hydrophilic nature, which enhances their compatibility with biological systems [ 284 286 Figure 7 (1) Minimally Invasive Administration: The liquid formulation of hydrogel can be injected directly into the irregular defect location via a tiny incision, eliminating the need for open surgery and enhancing patient recovery. (2) The hydrogel serves as a transient. Upon solidification (in situ gelation), it wraps the stem cells, furnishing them with a conducive environment for attachment, proliferation, and differentiation into the targeted cell type (e.g., cartilage or bone cells). (3) Patient-Specific Therapy: This approach often employs the patient’s own stem cells (autologous cells) through hydrogel, therefore minimizing the danger of immunological rejection and facilitating spontaneous recovery. Hydrogel technology signifies a significant transition from pre-formed, inflexible scaffolds to dynamic, cell-transporting liquid systems that solidify inside the body, effectively filling defects and actively facilitating tissue regeneration [ 287 Additionally, hydrogel chemicals allow for easier drug delivery and better blending with biological tissues, which makes them especially good for uses like heart tissue engineering, brain connections, and healing medicine. Injectable conductive hydrogels can be customized to meet the specific needs of different biological electronic systems and treatments by changing the makeup of the polymers, the density of the connections between them, and adding extra functional parts. Such customization makes it possible to regulate the mechanical, physiological, and electrical properties of the hydrogels [ 288 6.2.2. Organic Nanowires Nanowires are nanostructures that are characterized by a high aspect ratio and a single dimension. Their typical sizes range from a few nanometers to several hundred nanometers, and their lengths may exceed several micrometers [ 289 290 291 292 292 293 (1) Organic nanowires’ unique characteristics, such as their large surface area and electrically tunable characteristics, make them ideal for creating sensitive and selective biosensors. With the use of these biosensors, physiological indices and biomolecular interactions may be continuously monitored in real time [ 294 (2) Drug Delivery: Nanowires may be modified to improve the effectiveness and reduce the adverse effects of pharmacological therapies by using medicinal chemicals and nanocarriers for precise and regulated drug delivery [ 295 (3) Tissue Engineering: By integrating into scaffolds, organic semiconductor nanowires stimulate tissue regeneration by supplying electrical stimuli and assisting cells in developing and specializing [ 296 (4) Bioelectronic Implants: Devices based on organic nanowires may be created to be implanted with the least amount of intrusion. Through tight, stable, and long-lasting interactions with biological systems, these devices enable a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. 6.2.3. Organic Nanotube Organic semiconductor-based nanotubes are now being researched for a variety of applications, such as medication delivery, sensors, catalysts, optical devices, and biological applications. Lipids, peptides, DNA nanotubes, polymer-ONT conjugates, and hydrogels are required for these applications [ 297 6.3. System Integration and Interfaces Organic bioelectronic interfaces are one of the main topics of bioelectronics research. Their primary goal is to create seamless and compatible connections between biological systems and technological equipment to facilitate integration and two-way communication [ 298 299 300 301 7. Electrode-Tissue and Electrode-Cell Interactions Electrodes are crucial in many biomedical applications because they establish electrical interactions with biological processes. These include brain interface, cardiac pacing, and biosensory. significantly, these electrode-based devices’ compatibility, stability, and usefulness are Most determined by their interactions with the biological environment, which includes cells and tissues [ 300 302 The surrounding tissue may be impacted by pH [ 303 304 95 96 302 305 306 302 307 308 The electrode’s surface characteristics, such as its topography, chemistry, and charge, may have an impact on the form, adhesion, and growth of cells that come into contact with it. By enhancing these surface properties, it is possible to optimize the interactions among cells and electrodes and, therefore, the integration of the electrodes with their supporting cellular environment. Electrodes can affect how cells, like heart cells and nerve cells, behave electrically by changing how easily they can get excited and how their electrical charge moves along their membranes. Understanding these interactions is essential for creating electrodes that can efficiently attach to and capture data from excited cells [ 309 Inserting an electrode into the body may trigger a foreign body response, leading to the formation of fibrotic tissue around it. Thus, the encapsulation technique may hinder the electrode’s mechanical and electrical connection to the tissue it is targeting, thereby impacting the device’s operation [ 310 The adherence, growth, and morphology of cells that come into contact with the electrode may be impacted by the electrode’s surface characteristics, such as topography, chemical reactions, and charge. Cells may interact with the electrode and become more integrated with the local cellular environment if certain surface characteristics are optimized [ 311 312 The literature documents numerous methods to improve the interactions among electrodes, tissues, and cells. The contact between electrodes and tissues or cells is enhanced by surface modification, coatings, and bioactive substances such as hydrogels or conductive polymers. This process facilitates the integration of tissues and improves signal transmission. The electrode’s flexibility and miniaturization may enhance the mechanical engagement with the target tissue and reduce the foreign body response. Thus, this integration enhances the long-term stability and effectiveness of electrode-dependent devices. Furthermore, the development of electrodes that mimic the physical, chemical, and electrical properties of natural tissue, or biomimetic design, has the potential to enhance the overall compatibility of electrode-dependent devices and thereby boost integration [ 313 314 315 The creation of reliable and efficient electrode-based biomedical devices depends on knowledge of the complex interactions that exist between electrodes and their immediate biological environments. The biological compatibility as well as efficiency of these electrode-tissue and electrode-cell interfaces will be enhanced by ongoing research and development in the fields of materials, surface technology, and device design [ 316 Electrodes, shown in Figure 8 317 7.1. Methods to Improve Coupling and Signal Transduction The coupling and signal transmission in organic bioelectronic interfaces may be strengthened by a number of strategies that enhance the interaction and communication between biological components and organic bioelectronic devices [ 318 319 7.1.1.
