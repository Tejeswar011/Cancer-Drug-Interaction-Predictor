Introduction Maternal diet is a key determinant of fetal organ development, and excessive salt intake has been increasingly linked to long-term metabolic disorders. This study investigated the effects of maternal high-salt diet (HSD) on offspring liver health, with a focus on sex-specific structural and molecular alterations. Methods Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were fed either standard chow or an HSD (4% NaCl) during gestation and lactation. At 4 weeks of age, offspring livers were analyzed using histology, RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and biochemical assays. Connectivity Map (CMap) was applied to identify candidate therapeutic compounds. Results Maternal HSD significantly increased liver weight and hepatocyte size in offspring, with more pronounced effects in males. RNA sequencing identified 466 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in males and 309 in females, indicating sex-dependent dysregulation of pathways related to metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis. Masson's trichrome staining revealed increased collagen deposition, particularly in males, consistent with transcriptomic signatures of fibrosis. Immunofluorescence confirmed upregulation of apoptosis-related markers. CMap analysis identified potential therapeutic agents, including ketoprofen and BRD-K88741031, which alleviated HSD-induced hepatic injury in preliminary validation. Discussion Maternal high-salt intake induces sex-specific structural and molecular liver injury in offspring, highlighting the developmental origins of liver disease. These findings emphasize the importance of maternal nutrition in shaping offspring hepatic health and suggest potential pharmacological strategies to counteract early-life dietary insults. maternal nutrition high-salt diet liver injury transcriptomics sexual dimorphism The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as a powerful tool for exploring alterations in gene expression, offering an innovative approach to uncovering specific biological processes and associated novel mechanisms ( 36 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Overall study design The experimental design's schematic is presented in Supplementary Figure S1 2.2 Animals and tissue collection Twenty-four C57BL/6J wild-type mice (containing 16 females and eight males) aged 6–8 weeks were purchased from GemPharmatech Co., Ltd (Nanjing, Jiangsu). The newly acquired C57BL/6J mice were acclimated to a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle for 2 weeks before being mated at a ratio of two males to one female. Males were removed from cages once females became pregnant. During the experiment, pregnant mice were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (containing six pregnant mice) and the HSD group (containing 10 pregnant mice). Each pregnant mouse was placed in a separate cage to exclude miscarriage, stillbirth, or other factors that occurred during pregnancy, and the normal production of offspring was used for follow-up experiments. Litter sizes were not standardized post-natally; to reduce bias, each dam was housed separately. Offspring with body weights outside ±2 SD of the group mean at weaning were excluded (to minimize potential confounding due to litter variability or intrauterine growth restriction), and equal numbers of males and females were randomly selected from different litters. Offspring at 4 weeks of age were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and liver tissues were collected and weighed in the CONM, HSDM, CONF, and HSDF groups (each group included nine offspring after weight-based exclusions). All animals were euthanized and liver tissues collected during the light phase of the 12:12 cycle (09:00–11:00 a.m.) to minimize diurnal variation in hepatic weight and gene expression. Subsequently, the tissues were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C in a freezer. These liver tissues were collected for subsequent pharmacological experiments and RNA sequencing. Specifically, nine male and nine female offspring were included in each of the following experimental groups: CONM, CONF, HSDM, and HSDF. Three animals per group were used for transcriptomic analysis, and six animals were used pathological evaluation and therapeutic intervention studies. All experiment procedures were conducted in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Henan Province People's Hospital, and shall be conducted in accordance with relevant regulations. 2.3 H&E staining of the mouse liver Hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E staining) is one of the most used methods for staining paraffin sections, confirming the fundamental cellular structure. All experimental procedures were conducted according to previously published methods ( 37 38 2.4 Masson staining of the mouse liver Masson staining is primarily utilized for evaluating tissue fibrosis. All experimental procedures were conducted according to previously published methods ( 39 40 2.5 Immunohistochemistry of mouse liver Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a technique that involves the binding of antigens to antibodies to visualize protein expression in structures and tissues. This experiment followed procedures described in the literature ( 38 41 42 2.6 RNA extraction and RNA sequencing The liver tissues of the CONM, HSDM, CONF, and HSDF groups were collected, weighed, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. First, frozen mouse liver tissues were ground using a mortar, and RNA was extracted using the RNA Easy Spin Column Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the TRIzol RNA extraction protocol. Second, after qualifying the samples, RNA libraries were prepared using the DNBSEQ platform ( 43 Mus musculus 2.7 Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver tissues using the Total RNA Extractor (TRIzol) Kit (Cat. No. B511311; Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration and purity were assessed via spectrophotometry prior to complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. cDNA was synthesized using the Maxima Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Cat. No. EP0743; Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-qPCR reactions were carried out using the SGExcel FastSYBR Mixture Kit (Cat. No. B532955; Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) under standard cycling conditions. Gene expression levels were normalized to the internal reference gene GAPDH, and relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method. For validation of gene expression, mRNA levels of CPT1a, ACOX2, CYP4A14, Xbp1, Per2 CD68 44 46 Supplementary Table S1 2.8 Differentially expressed genes Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are those whose expression levels change significantly under different conditions. The primary goal of transcriptomics is to identify genes that differ between different comparison groups, thereby elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences. Therefore, the analysis of differential gene expression is crucial for interpreting the results ( 47 48 Q P 49 2.9 Principal component analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to assess the correlation and dispersion among samples in sequencing data ( 50 2.10 Functional enrichment GO and KEGG analyses Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis was conducted using BGI's Dr. Tom P 38 51 P 2.11 Gene set enrichment analysis Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a computational biology method used to analyze gene expression data with the aim of uncovering gene expression patterns associated with specific biological processes, pathways, or functions. Specifically, metabolic pathways in HSD-treated male and female offspring were analyzed using GSEA software version 4.0.3. Typically, pathways with |NES| >1, NOM P q 2.12 Protein–protein association networks This study focused on revealing protein–protein association networks (PPANs) of metabolism-related, immune-related, fibrosis-related, and apoptosis-related genes. These results of PPANs were represented by the STRING database ( https://string-db.org/ 52 2.13 Identification of potential small-molecule drugs for the treatment of high salt diet-induced liver injury The study utilized the Connectivity Map (CMap) online platform ( https://clue.io/ Following weaning (at 4 weeks of age), offspring were randomly assigned to treatment or vehicle control groups ( n 53 54 55 Sex- and diet-matched HSD-only groups receiving vehicle treatment served as negative controls. All animals were monitored throughout the treatment period for signs of overt toxicity, including changes in body weight, grooming behavior, and food intake. No visible signs of systemic toxicity were observed. At the end of the intervention, liver tissues were harvested for histopathological analysis. Molecular assays (e.g., post-treatment RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, and protein validation) were not performed in this study but are planned for future investigations. 2.14 Statistical analysis and software The Venn diagram plotter (Venny) version 2.1.0 and Excel 2021 software were used to compare the transcript counts between the normal offspring group and the HSD-treated offspring group. PCA was performed using STAMP statistical software. Additionally, the heatmap was generated using R (64-bit, version 3.5.3). GraphPad Prism software version 8.1.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS 27.0 software (IBM) were used to generate bar, line, and scatter plots. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The data are presented as mean ± SEM (standard error) and were considered statistically significant at a P 3 Results 3.1 Maternal HSD leads to liver injury in offspring mice This study aimed to determine whether an HSD affects the liver weight and structure of offspring mice by measuring body weight, liver tissue weight, and analyzing HE staining results of liver tissue ( 25 56 P P P Figure 1A P Figure 1B Figure 1C Figure 1 Effects of maternal HSD on the liver of male and female offspring in mice.

The Venn diagram and PCA results are presented below. In male mouse offspring, 16,398 and 16,627 transcripts were identified in the livers of the normal male (CONM) and HSD-treated male (HSDM) groups, respectively. Similarly, in female mouse offspring, 16,454 and 16,592 transcripts were detected in the normal female (CONF) and HSD-treated female (HSDF) livers, respectively. Notably, 229 genes in CONM and 138 genes in CONF were below the detection threshold ( Figure 1G Figure 1H Figures 1D–F Figure 1D Supplementary Table S2 Figure 1E Supplementary Table S3 Figure 1F Supplementary Table S4 CPT1a, ACOX2, CYP4A14, Xbp1, Per2 CD68 44 45 57 59 Supplementary Figure S2 Supplementary Table S1 Finally, transcripts were classified into low, higher, and highly expressed genes, revealing that maternal HSD alters the liver transcriptome composition in offspring mice, particularly exhibiting gender-specific differences. In the CONM group, among the 16,398 transcripts, 5,659 (34.51%) were low expression genes, 8,142 (49.65%) were higher expression genes, and 2,597 (15.84%) were highly expression genes; and in HSDM group, the low, higher, and highly expression genes accounted for 5,850 (35.18%), 8,099 (48.71%), and 2,678 (16.11%) from 16,627 transcripts, respectively. However, for female offspring, among the 16,454 transcripts in the CONF group, 5,600 (34.03%) were low expression genes, 8,079 (49.10%) were higher expression genes, and 2,775 (16.87%) were highly expression genes, and from the 17,036 transcripts in the HSDF group, the low, higher, and highly expressed genes accounted for 5,100 (29.94%), 8,565 (50.28%), and 3,371 (19.79%), respectively ( Figure 1I 3.3 HSD affected KEGG pathways of higher expressed genes in the offspring To investigate the transcriptomic impact of maternal HSD on offspring liver, we focused on the higher expressed genes (main screening criteria: 1 ≤ FPKM < 20), which represent most of the gene expression. Venn diagrams and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed to compare expression patterns between CONM and HSDM, CONF and HSDF, and between sexes ( Figures 2A B Supplementary Figure S3A Figures 2C H Supplementary Figures S3B D Figure 2 Maternal HSD alters KEGG pathways with sex-specific effects in the liver of offspring mice.

(F) details pathways exclusive to CONF, (G) shows pathways shared between CONF and HSDF, and (H) displays pathways exclusive to HSDF. Dot plots indicate significant pathways via color - coded p - values and dot size reflecting gene numbers. In male offspring, 600 (6.90%) highly expressed genes were unique to the CONM group, 557 (6.40%) to the HSDM group, and 7,542 (86.70%) were shared ( Figure 2A Figure 2C Figure 2D Figure 2E Figure 2B Figure 2F Figure 2G Figure 2H Supplementary Figure S3A Supplementary Figure S3B Supplementary Figure S3C Supplementary Figure S3D These findings reveal distinct transcriptomic responses to maternal high-salt intake between male and female offspring, characterized by both shared and sex-specific alterations in molecular pathways. While commonly affected pathways suggest core disruptions in cell cycle control and immune regulation, unique enrichment patterns in each group underscore sex-dependent sensitivities to metabolic, signaling, and infection-related processes. This highlights the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in evaluating developmental programming effects of prenatal environmental exposures. 3.4 HSD during pregnancy and lactation induces liver disease in offspring mice Usually, a high-salt diet induces various diseases, including cardiovascular and neurological diseases, as well as other organ lesions ( 19 60 61 Ager, Dph1, Steap4, Nfe2l1, Ppara, Rbmx, Nr1d1, Ccar2, Axl Abcg5 Figure 3A Ager, Fech, Fn1, Sik1, Myb, Ppara, Scd1, Nr1d1 Axl Figure 3B P P Figure 3C P Figure 3D Figure 3 Maternal HSD induces changes in the expression profiles of liver-related genes and leads to varying degrees of liver disease in offspring mice.

Each section provides insight into genetic and histological differences, organized for comparative analysis. 3.6 HSD changes the expression levels of metabolism-related genes in the liver of offspring mice Studies have shown that adverse maternal factors during pregnancy significantly impact offspring, leading to metabolic disorders ( 62 63 Supplementary Figure S4A P P P P P P P P P P Supplementary Figure S4B P P P P P P P P P P Supplementary Figure S4C Supplementary Figures S4D E Supplementary Figure S4F Supplementary Figure S4G 3.7 HSD increases biomarkers of inflammation in the liver in offspring mice To investigate the impact of maternal HSD on immune-related molecular features in the offspring liver, we analyzed changes in immune-related transcript levels. In male offspring, 52 differential liver immune-related genes were identified between those treated with HSD and those on a normal diet ( Figure 5A Figure 5B P P Figures 5C D Figures 5E F P P P Figure 5E P P P Figure 5F Figure 6A Figure 5 Maternal HSD leads to changes in the expression profile of liver immune-related genes of offspring mice.

Each image is marked with a scale of 20 micrometers. Both graphs show statistical significance between various groups. 3.8 Maternal HSD promotes the apoptosis of liver cells in offspring mice In this study, we demonstrated that a maternal HSD alters the expression of apoptosis-related transcriptome genes in the offspring liver, potentially accelerating liver cell apoptosis. Cleaved caspase-3 serves as an apoptosis marker. Consequently, we employed immunofluorescence staining to examine the impact of maternal HSD on liver cell apoptosis in offspring mice. Maternal HSD induced apoptosis in both male and female offspring mice compared to the control group. Additionally, there was a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression levels in the liver of offspring exposed to HSD conditions ( Figure 6B Supplementary Figures S5A B Supplementary Figure S5C Supplementary Figures S5D G 3.9 Screening treatment of high salt diet-induced liver injury: potential small molecule compounds CMap analysis was performed on the identified upregulated DEGs in male and female offspring mice, and the critical Top50 compounds with norm_cs < 0 in the results were selected ( Supplementary Tables S9 S10 Figures 7A 8A 64 65 66 69 70 71 72 Figure 7B Figure 8B Figure 7C P Figure 7D Figure 8C Figure 8D P Figure 7 Potential small molecule compounds for the treatment of HSD induced liver injury in male offspring.

Inadequate maternal dietary habits during pregnancy and lactation may result in health issues for newborns. A significant finding of this study is that maternal HSD adversely affects the livers of offspring mice and can induce sex-specific liver diseases. Separate statements are as follows: (1) a maternal HSD had different effects on the body weight, liver weight, and liver structure of male and female offspring mice. (2) Maternal HSD altered the transcriptome composition of offspring liver tissue, leading to differential expression of genes and KEGG and GO-enriched pathways, with sex-specific differences. This finding is consistent with previous reports that organ transcriptome compositions are sex-specific ( 38 73 74 Perinatal maternal lifestyle and environmental exposures have varied effects on offspring, including body weight and organ development. A high-fat diet during pregnancy can affect fetal body mass by enhancing the placental nutrient transport capacity ( 75 76 19 77 79 80 35 38 81 These sex-specific hepatic effects are likely mediated by differences in hepatic transcriptional networks and endocrine signaling. Sexually dimorphic expression of transcription factors such as STAT5b, HNF4α, and FOXA1/2 is known to influence lipid metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and fibrotic remodeling ( 82 83 33 Fibrosis can develop in various organs, significantly contributing to morbidity and mortality ( 84 85 38 86 87 88 89 90 Many diseases induced by high salt are linked to metabolism, inflammation, and autoimmunity ( 60 91 92 93 13 94 95 96 56 97 CMap is an online tool for drug discovery. The working principle of CMap analysis is to obtain a professional drug research platform for corresponding corrective drugs based on the gene expression differences in target diseases. Using this tool, we obtained a total of 20 top-ranked small-molecule drugs as new drugs for the treatment of liver damage. The gene biological information analysis method used in this study obtained the above drugs. Although preliminary pathological results have confirmed the effectiveness of ketoprofen and BRD-K88741031 in treating liver damage in male and female offspring caused by a high-salt diet, recent studies have shown that ketoprofen plays a key role in improving white fat browning and alleviating diet-induced obesity. Although ketoprofen and BRD-K88741031 treatment improved liver structure and fibrosis histologically, this study did not evaluate their effects on reversing HSD-induced transcriptomic alterations or modulating critical signaling pathways (e.g., TGF-β, NF-κB, or PPAR). This is a significant limitation because functional rescue at the molecular level is crucial for validating therapeutic relevance. Future work will involve transcriptomic and proteomic profiling after treatment to evaluate target engagement and pathway reversal. Additionally, comprehensive preclinical studies, such as dose–response curves, liver function tests, and toxicity assays, are planned to establish the pharmacological and safety profiles of these candidates in a sex-specific context. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that maternal HSD induces structural and molecular alterations in offspring livers, with more pronounced effects in males, involving fibrotic, inflammatory, and apoptotic pathways. These results carry important translational implications. Globally, average salt intake is nearly double the WHO recommendation, and pregnant women are particularly susceptible to excessive consumption due to taste alterations ( 5 22 98 99 19 100 While our data suggest that maternal HSD adversely affects the livers of offspring mice, this study has several limitations. Firstly, although mice share key features of mammalian liver biology, species differences—such as circadian metabolism and sodium handling—necessitate cautious extrapolation, and longitudinal human cohort studies are essential to validate the observed programming effects ( 101 102 103 104 105 5 Conclusion In conclusion, an HSD during pregnancy and lactation can impact the liver development of offspring, with male offspring showing greater sensitivity to these effects. Maternal HSD induces significant changes in the liver transcriptome of offspring, potentially leading to liver damage through alterations in metabolic, immune, fibrosis, and apoptosis processes. CMap was employed to identify potential therapeutic drugs for mitigating HSD-induced liver damage in offspring. Therefore, our findings contribute to understanding sex-specific gene–diet interactions underlying maternal HSD-induced liver reprogramming, which can inform the development of effective strategies to prevent liver-related diseases.
