The prognostic value of treatment response and survival has been verified for solely established imaging, clinical, and biochemical markers. There is a lack of evidence for the combination of those parameters with machine learning and integrated models, particularly in the context of molecular imaging. Objectives: The aim of this study was to predict early disease progression and survival using CT-based radiomic features (RF), integrating [ 18 Design: This retrospective pilot study included 62 patients with non-metastatic and metastatic SCLC who underwent stage-based primary treatment following baseline [ 18 Methods: A radiomics signature was generated based on the first-line treatment response by RECIST 1.1 criteria. The RF was integrated using binary logistic regression analysis with the PET parameter metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of the primary tumor and initial disease stage. The integrated model with the highest AUC for predicting early disease progression was evaluated for predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in both non-metastatic and metastatic patients. Results: A single CT-based RF demonstrated predictive capacity (AUC = 0.81). Integration of the MTV and disease stage enhanced the predictive capacity (AUC = 0.9). A Youden index-based threshold of <0.62 was identified as a significant predictor of prolonged PFS: non-metastatic disease with a median PFS of 25 versus 4 months (HR = 0.072; p p p Conclusion: A multiparametric approach based on a Radiomics model may potentially be capable of identifying patients at risk for early disease progression, PFS, and OS in non-metastatic and metastatic SCLC.

Material and methods Study design This is a retrospective, single-center observational study in a tertiary care academic medical center. All patients received first-line treatment according to pivotal study protocols. In patients with non-metastatic disease a platinum-etoposide and radiation-based treatment protocol was administered.  20 20 21 This study was approved by the local ethics committee (Number 2022-391-f-S, Ethics Commission of the Medical Association Westphalia-Lippe and the University of Muenster). This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964 and its subsequent amendments. Patient selection Patients treated between 2013 and 2022 were included based on the following criteria: (a) histologically confirmed SCLC; (b) baseline PET with follow-up clinical and imaging data for response evaluation; (c) approval of the interdisciplinary lung tumor board for guideline-based therapy protocols; (d) completed first-line therapy regime; (e) date of death or last follow-up from the cancer registry; (f) age > 18 years. Baseline PET-CT All patients underwent baseline PET-CT prior to treatment initiation based on literature recommendations. 7 22 18 CT-based response and survival evaluation All imaging, patient, and procedural data were obtained retrospectively from the electronic medical record and the image archiving and communication system. Clinical data and therapy validations were retrieved from the electronic health records. First and second follow-up imaging were performed after treatment initiation to assess treatment response using a contrast-enhanced CT scan. The first follow-up was performed at a median interval of 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.6–2.3 months) as an interim assessment, and the second follow-up was performed at a median interval of 4.6 months (95% CI: 4.3–4.9 months) after the completion of the primary treatment protocol. At these two time points, a standardized objective assessment of treatment response was performed by an experienced radiologist. For this purpose, serial segmentation of the primary tumor was performed on contrast-enhanced CT chest scans using the mint Lesion ™  23 Image segmentation and standard parameter extraction of baseline PET-CT Semi-automatic segmentation through volumetric region of interest (ROI) of the primary tumor was performed by an experienced nuclear medicine and radiology senior physician using mint Lesion™. Readers selected the primary tumor in both PET and CT images, defined as: PET: According to the “Positron Emission Response Criteria In Solid Tumors” (PERCIST 1.1), a threshold of 1.5 × mean liver “standardized uptake value” (SUV MEAN 18  24 PEAK 3 MAX MEAN MIN MEAN  25 CT: The ROI of the primary tumor region was delineated in the late arterial phase of a contrast-enhanced CT scan in accordance with the established RECIST 1.1 criteria.  23 Radiomic feature selection and analysis Following the guidelines of the Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI), 57 radiomic features (RFs) including morphology, intensity-based, histogram-based (first-order texture), and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM, second-order texture) features were extracted for the primary lung tumor in both PET and CT separately.  26 z  27 For further feature reduction, the dataset was split into training and validation subsets with a 70:30 ratio for a fixed hold-out set of patients to provide an unbiased estimate for further analysis. The trainings-set population of 70% of the included patients meet the recommended TRIPOD+AI (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) statement and PROBAST+AI (The Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool) framework for the use of ML models. 28 29 Statistical analysis Demographic and clinical data are presented as totals, percentages, medians, ranges, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). ROC analysis, with area under the curve (AUC) and Youden J for calculating the optimal threshold, was used to determine the value of different individual parameters. Parameters for integration were selected by univariate analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model based on a combination of significant clinical, PET-based, and radiomic parameters for calculating the probability of the given outcome at second follow-up (DCR vs PD) was employed. A ROC analysis with AUC was used to calculate the optimal threshold (1.000-fold bootstrap-validated) with Youden J for predicting response at second follow-up (DCR vs PD) for combined parameters, The Kaplan–Meier analysis with log-rank test (Mantel-Cox) was used to predict PFS and OS with the significant integrated parameter for separated groups (non-metastatic and metastatic). Cox-Regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR). p Results Patients’ characteristics Between December 2013 and October 2022, a total of 62 patients (33 males [53.2%], 29 females [46.8%]) with a median age of 64.5 years (range: 34–84 years) met our previously defined inclusion criteria. All patients were treatment naive. A total of 27 patients (43.5%) were classified as having non-metastatic disease according to the TNM UICC 8 classification, while 35 patients (56.5%) were classified as having metastatic disease.  30 Table 1 Table 1.

Response to treatment at second follow-up A second follow-up with contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed to assess response on first-line therapy according to RECIST 1.1 criteria of the primary tumor.  23 n Figure 1 Figure 1(a) Figure 1(b) Figure 1. Response assessment to therapy. A 67-year-old male received carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab and revealed PR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria at the second follow-up (a). A 54-year-old female received the same aforementioned treatment protocol and exhibited PD according to RECIST 1.1 criteria at the second follow-up (b). This image compares the response assessment to therapy for two patients, a 67-year-old male and a 54-year-old female, using various imaging modalities. Prediction of early disease progression with integrated diagnostics in the test cohort Following the radiomics analysis of the data, one radiomic CT feature, namely, “Firstorder.Intensity.Quartile_Coefficient_Dispersion” (CT_FIQCD) representing tumor imaging micro-heterogeneity due to the composition of grey scales, was identified as having predictive value to early progression at the second follow-up imaging in the test cohort ( n Figure 2(a) Figure 2. ROC analysis of standard, radiomic, and integrated parameters. ROC analysis of selected parameters that were significant ( p The ROC curve in Figure 5(a) compares the performance of standard, radiomic, and integrated parameters on true positive rates against false positive rates for thyroid cancer diagnosis. Figure 5(b) illustrates an integrated approach that considers both standard and radiomic parameters, achieving an AUC value of 0.9. The use of isolated PET-based and clinical standard parameters showed a lower ability than CT_FIQCD to predict early disease progression. For example, MTV (median: 18.6, range: 7.8–246.6) showed an AUC of 0.71 in the ROC analysis ( Figure 2(a) Figure 2(b) p Figure 2(a) Figure 2(b) Prediction of PFS and OS of the entire cohort using the integrated model for non-metastatic and metastatic disease The radiomic model and the standard PET parameters were based on data obtained from the primary tumor for both groups. The final ROC analysis of the total cohort revealed an AUC of 0.902 for the parameters of the aforementioned integrated model with a threshold of 0.62. Accordingly, patients with a threshold over 0.62 (Youden J: 0.41, sensitivity 83%, specificity 100%) are associated with a higher risk of disease progression (at second follow-up imaging) in both patients with non-metastatic and metastatic disease. The final threshold was calculated with the equation as follows:  l o g i t ( t h r e s h o l d ) = − 3 . 47 + 5 . 92 ★ ( C T F I Q C D ) + 0 . 027 ★ ( M T V i n c m 3 ) + 1 . 84 ★ ( S t a g e ) t h r e s h o l d = 1 1 + exp [ − ( − 3 . 47 + ( 5 . 92 ★ C T F I Q C D ) + ( 0 . 027 ★ M T V ) + ( 1 . 84 ★ S t a g e ) ) ] It is noteworthy that the integrated model exhibited a significant increase in the PFS of patients with a threshold below 0.62, when analyzing the total PFS for the separated groups (metastatic vs non-metastatic). For non-metastatic disease ( n p Figure 3(a) n P Figure 3(b) n p Figure 3(c) n p Figure 3(d) Figure 3. PFS and OS analysis in non-metastatic and metastatic disease. The Kaplan–Meier analysis and the Cox regression model were employed to assess the integrated parameter, with a threshold of 0.62 applied to the entire cohort, categorized into non-metastatic and metastatic disease groups. Patients exhibiting a threshold below 0.62 of the integrated parameters have been shown to demonstrate a significantly prolonged PFS in both groups (a and b). For OS analysis the threshold below 0.62 was not significant in the non-metastatic group (c), but in the metastatic group (d). The image contains four Kaplan-Meier survival curves comparing non-metastatic and metastatic disease. Each curve represents the cumulative survival of patients over time, with three categories based on an integrated parameter value of 0.62 and below. The curves are presented as step-down plots, showing the proportion of patients surviving over time. The x-axis for PFS months ranges from 0 to over 60 months, while the x-axis for OS months ranges from 0 to over 100 months. The y-axis for both sets of curves represents cumulative survival, ranging from 0 to 1. The non-metastatic curves show a quicker decline compared to the metastatic curves, indicating a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for metastatic disease. The comparison highlights the impact of tumor burden on survival outcomes. Discussion Despite the addition of checkpoint inhibitors to conventional chemotherapy in metastatic and non-metastatic disease, SCLC patients are still characterized by poor outcomes, with the majority of patients experiencing disease progression within a few months of initiating first-line therapy. 31 33 34 37  6  30  38  39 The objective of the present study was to determine whether a radiomics model incorporating PET, CT, and clinical parameters could identify different risk groups of patients with SCLC. The integration of reliable, uniform parameters has resulted in an improvement in the model’s ability to anticipate early disease progression, as well as PFS and OS for the separate groups (non-metastatic and metastatic). The results of our study suggest that the integration of clinical data with advanced imaging features (CT and PET/CT) may prove to be a tool for risk stratification in SCLC patients independent of initial tumor stage (non-metastatic vs metastatic). CT-based radiomics model Radiomics is an emerging discipline that uses ML algorithms to derive quantitative, high-throughput parameters from standard imaging techniques. This approach has the potential to optimize treatment stratification in a manner consistent with the principles of personalized medicine, particularly in the context of lung cancer.  38  15 17 18  40  41  17 Integration of clinical- and standard PET parameters In recent years, several studies have explored the extension of nomograms to disease prognostication using standard parameters and biomarkers.  42  18 Single standard PET parameters, such as SUVmax and MTV reflecting the metabolic activity and glucose consumption of a tumor, have been shown to be predictive parameters in SCLC patients. 10 43  43  7 The value of prognostic biomarkers like neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and circulating tumor cells (CTC) has been identified as factors that influence the OS for SCLC patients. As posited by Liu et al. (2017), patients exhibiting elevated NLR levels demonstrated a twofold elevated risk (HR: 2.09) of mortality. Hiltermann et al. (2012) observed a threefold elevated risk (HR: 3.4) for the presence of detectable CTC prior to treatment initiation.  45 Limitations This study is limited by its retrospective approach and small patient cohort, which was further divided into a training and a validation set. Consequently, a survival analysis of the test cohort’s subgroups ( n For our radiomics analysis, we included patients with both metastatic and non-metastatic tumor stages, which resulted in a heterogeneous patient population. Furthermore, patients with metastatic disease received a different first-line treatment before March 2020 (chemotherapy only) due to the approval status of the immunotherapy. It should also be noted that the examination times of the follow-up imaging, which formed the basis of our analysis, were understandably not uniform due to the real-world setting. Conclusion This is the first study to investigate the role of a Radiomics model incorporating both PET- and CT-based Radiomic parameters in SCLC. Our analysis suggests that an integrated model based on ML approaches, incorporating parameters from PET and CT, may allow to identify different risk groups in patients with non-metastatic and metastatic SCLC.
