Highlights • First comprehensive genetic study integrating MR, MTAG, and colocalization to dissect BTC pathogenesis. • Identified actionable genetic variants with dual roles in gallstone formation and carcinogenesis. • Demonstrated independent BTC risk pathways unrelated to cholelithiasis. Summary Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is highly malignant and more prevalent in populations with cholelithiasis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential genetic links between cholelithiasis and BTC. We first employed single- and two-sample Mendelian randomization to assess whether the association between cholelithiasis and BTC incidence was influenced by confounding factors, revealing a significant association between cholelithiasis and BTC ( P P P P Key words Multi-trait analysis of GWAS Risk loci UK Biobank Colocalization pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Malignant tumors of biliary tract are notorious for their highly aggressive nature and dismal prognosis, posing significant challenges in the field of oncology [ 1 2 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The ABCG5/8 transporter, when functionally impaired, disrupts the normal transport of bile acids, thereby predisposing to the formation of cholelithiasis [ 3 13 14 This study integrated genomic data from multiple public databases and GWAS summary statistics, using MR methodology to minimize confounding effects and systematically evaluate the assocition. Multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) was further utilized to explore the shared genetic architecture, and colocalization analysis was performed to dissect potential regulatory relationships. Finally, the relevance of risk loci was validated in a cholelithiasis-free population to explore independent genetic pathways. Method Study population Our cohort data were derived from the UK Biobank (UKB), a comprehensive biomedical database that integrates extensive population health information and genetic research resources [ 15 The UKB received ethics approval from the North West Multicenter Research Ethics Committee. All participants provided informed written consent, and they had the option to withdraw their personal data from the study at any time. The research was carried out utilizing resources from the UKB, with application number 85,224. Single and two-sample MR The MR analysis was conducted to determine the causal relationship between gallstones and BCT while controlling for confounding factors, with liver cancer and pancreatic cancer serving as comparison diseases [ [16] [17] [18] To estimate the causal relationships between cholelithiasis and HPCs at the individual level within the UKB cohort, we implemented a single MR approach utilizing the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method [ 19 20 21 Additionally, two-sample MR analyses were conducted using the R software package TwoSampleMR (Version 0.6.8) [ 22 p 23 GWAS and MTAG In addition to FinnGen data, we obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the GWAS Catalog ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ 24 25 We conducted three distinct analyses to explore the genetic associations between cholelithiasis and BTC traits using summary statistics from three cohorts, employing the MTAG framework. MTAG implements a generalized inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) meta-analysis approach, which enhances statistical power for locus identification by leveraging shared genetic architecture across related traits [ 26 P Functional mapping and annotation We employed the Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS (FUMA) platform to conduct a comprehensive functional analysis on the summary statistics derived from MTAG [ 27 P r Subsequently, we performed detailed annotation and gene prioritization analyses, incorporating all independent SNPs identified. Pairwise LD calculations were conducted using the European reference population from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. For positional gene mapping, SNPs were assigned to protein-coding genes if they fell within a 10 kb window upstream or downstream of any transcript, as defined in Ensembl build v92 [ 28 Colocalization We employed the coloc software [ 29 Bulk RNA-seq data analysis and single-cell RNA-seq data analysis The bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of cholangiocarcinoma tissues were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort ( http://tcga.xenahubs.net 30 GSE138709 31 http://tisch.comp-genomics.org/ Carcinogenesis and statistical analyses We employed a hard-calling approach to convert imputed genotype dosages into discrete genotypes (0, 1, 2) by selecting the genotype with the highest posterior probability. For colocalized loci, cancer incidence analysis was performed by grouping individuals carrying one or two effect alleles (1/2) as one group and those without the effect allele as the control group. Variants with a MAF below 0.05 were excluded from the analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95 % confidence interval (CI). In cases where the allele exhibited a protective effect, the reference allele was swapped, and Cox regression was repeated to ensure robustness. All statistical analyses were performed using R software version 4.3.3. To visualize cumulative incidence, we employed the R packages “survival” and “survminer.” A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result Baseline characteristics and cancer incidence rates Our study cohort initially comprised 502,191 individuals, of which 363,846—192,628 females and 171,218 males with a median follow-up duration of 14.9 (13.9–15.7) years (Figure S1). The study included 23,326 cholelithiasis patients and 340,520 controls, with average ages of 58.36 (±7.59) and 56.45 (±8.03) years, respectively.

MR results After excluding SNPs that are related to confounding factors associated with cancer as previously reported, such as BMI, and those that cannot be obtained from the imputed data of the UKB, a total of 56 variants were retained as IVs for the single MR analysis.

Fig. 1 In our two-sample MR analysis, after excluding IVs associated with confounding factors, weak correlations, and SNPs with significant heterogeneity, a causal and positive association between cholelithiasis and BTC was demonstrated using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of 1.383 (95 % CI: 1.098–1.742, P Fig. 1 P p Fig. 1 Novel loci identified in GWAS and MTAG analysis The results of the BTC GWAS in the UKB population are summarized in Figure S5. When integrating BTC with cholelithiasis in MTAG, no significant risk loci for BTC were identified (Figure S6). Similarly, no significant loci were detected in the Finnish or Japanese databases (Figures S7 and S8). Within the UKB dataset, no significant loci were associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (Figure S9), whereas hundreds of significant risk loci were identified for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( Fig. 2 Table 2 Fig. 2 Manhattan plots of cholelithiasis and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma after MTAG in the UKB.

Colocalization In the liver, the following QTL colocalizations were observed: rs72800933 with ABCG5, rs1800961 with C20orf62 and rs804267 with FAM85A. For splicing QTLs (sQTLs), the colocalized variants included rs4953029 with LRPPRC, rs1800961 with TOX2, and rs804267 with CTSB, as illustrated in Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Circular figure visualising regional plots on the 5 colocalised loci between extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, cholelithiasis, and quantitative trait loci (QTL). Fig. 3 Association between loci risk and BTC, QTL and cholelithiasis We conducted Cox regression analyses on variants near rs4953029 located within a Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Association between ABCG5, ABCG8, and LRPPRC loci with the risk of BTC, QTL, and cholelithiasis. Fig. 4 The HR for the effect allele of rs6741243 showed a 41 % increased risk compared to the reference group (95 % CI: 13 %–75 %), while the HR for rs7599981 indicated a 35 % increased risk (95 % CI: 12 %–63 %).The incidence of BTC in the effect alleles group and the control group is shown in Figure 6A and 6B, with significant differences observed in both groups Both rs6741243 and rs7599981 were significantly associated with cholelithiasis ( Fig. 4 Further analysis revealed that rs6741243 exhibited a significant negative correlation with splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) of the liver gene ABCG5 (beta = −0.34, P Fig. 4 P 11 Gene expression analysis In cholangiocarcinoma tissues from TCGA dataset, the expression of LRPPRC was significantly higher compared to normal tissues ( P Fig. 5 P Fig. 5 2 P Fig. 5 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Cumulative hazard of biliary tract cancer and the expression of ABCG5 and LRPPRC in cholangiocarcinoma tumors. Fig. 5 Discussion We conducted a large-scale, comprehensive study to explore the genetic relationship between cholelithiasis and BTC, we discovered multiple loci near the coding regions of ABCG5/8 and LRPPRC, particularly in the intermediate regions, that are associated with both cholelithiasis and BTC. Notably, rs6741243 and rs4953029 may simultaneously influence cholelithiasis and BTC by modulating the expression of genes such as ABCG5, ABCG8, and LRPPRC. The current consensus is that cholelithiasis increases the risk of BTC. Previous studies, mainly relying on prospective cohorts or case-control designs, seek higher-level evidence [ 5 [32] [33] [34] [35] Genetic factors play a significant role in the pathogenesis of cholelithiasis, with approximately 25 % of the risk attributed to genetic determinants [ 3 Given the potential link between cholelithiasis and BTC, we excluded patients with cholelithiasis and used Cox regression to independently assess the impact of genetic loci on BTC risk. This analysis identified multiple loci within the coding regions of the chromosome associated with BTC risk. Following LD analysis, the risk genes were categorized into two groups: ABCG5-related and LRPPRC-related. Our analysis identified that the rs6741243 downregulates the sQTL of the ABCG5 gene, which is known to contribute to cholelithiasis. ABCG5 forms a heterodimer with ABCG8 (ABCG5/G8), which functions as a cholesterol transporter playing a central role in maintaining systemic cholesterol homeostasis and promoting hepatic cholesterol excretion into bile. Dysfunction of this complex is a major genetic susceptibility factor for cholesterol gallstone formation [ 36 37 38 Rs7599981 was associated with cancer risk, although its functional role remains unconfirmed. In contrast, rs4953029 showed a significant correlation with the sQTL of LRPPRC in the liver, and the high expression of LRPPRC in tumor tissues and tumor cells further supports this association. LRPPRC is a multifunctional protein localized to mitochondria that is essential for maintaining mitochondrial mRNA stability, polyadenylation, and coordinated translation [ 39 40 41 42 43 Limitations of th absence of QTL or sQTL evidence supporting the effect of rs4953029 and other loci in strong LD on ABCG8 complicates the identification of the specific mechanism responsible for gene expression changes associated with cholelithiasis. This lack of evidence makes it challenging to determine which variant influences ABCG8 expression and contributes to cholelithiasis susceptibility. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise genetic mechanisms underlying this association. In conclusion, variants near rs6741243 and rs7599981 may simultaneously influence cholelithiasis and BTC by modulating the expression of genes such as ABCG5, ABCG8, and LRPPRC.
