This study showed ovarian cancer cells overexpressing EMSY produce more lactate and have upregulated LDHA expression; the promoting effect of EMSY on the malignant phenotype of these cells is eliminated when LDHA expression is knocked down or glycolysis is inhibited in ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that EMSY interacts with β-catenin, and the knockdown of EMSY inhibits the transcriptional activation of LDHA by β-catenin. In summary, this study identifies EMSY’s metabolic regulatory role in ovarian cancer cells and offers treatment of ovarian cancer with a new therapeutic target.

Materials and methods Cell culture The human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCA429 (RRID:CVCL_3936), OVCA433 (RRID:CVCL_0475), and HEK293T (RRID:CVCL_0063) were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank in Shanghai, China. HEK293T and ovarian cancer cells were cultured in DMEM enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin to enhance cell viability and prevent contamination. In a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 Clinical samples The human female ovarian cancer tissues from Hainan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital were collected. All tissue samples were following patients signing informed consent forms. A total of 6 pairs of samples were used in this study. The Hainan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital’s Ethics Committee approved this study. qPCR TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was utilized to extract total RNA, and 1 µg of the isolated RNA was subsequently converted into cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT Kit (Takara) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. A CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) performed quantitative real-time PCR with the SYBR Green Kit. Using β-actin as the reference gene, the 2 − ΔΔCt IHC After obtaining informed consent from the patients, ovarian cancer samples and adjacent tissues were taken from Hainan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital. Hospital Institutional Ethics Committee ethical permission was acquired. Before antigen retrieval in EDTA solution, tissue slices were deparaffinized and rehydrated for 30 min at 100 °C. After a natural cooling time to room temperature, a blocking agent was incubated for 15 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. The tissue slices were then treated with LDHA (Proteintech, 19,987–1-AP, 1:100) and EMSY (Proteintech, 26,212–1-AP, 1:100) primary antibodies over the course of the night at 4 °C. The tissue sections were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. To observe immunohistochemical signals, 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used. The hematoxylin counterstain was applied to every tissue section. Western blot The cells were lysed on ice with RIPA lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, following two washes with PBS. The BCA protein assay kit was employed to ascertain the protein concentration in the supernatant derived from the centrifuged cell lysate. SDS–PAGE gel electrophoresis was used to separate proteins in equal amounts, and the resultant proteins were subsequently transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with BSA and incubated with various primary antibodies specific to the target proteins at 4 °C for the entire night. These included anti-Tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-5286, 1:4000), anti-GAPDH (Proteintech, 60,004–1-lg, 1:1000), anti-EMSY (Proteintech, 26,212–1-AP, 1:100), anti-HA (Proteintech, 81,290–1-RR, 1:1000), anti-Flag (Proteintech, 66,008–4-lg, 1:1000), anti-β-catenin (Proteintech, 51,067–2-AP, 1:1000), and anti-LDHA (Proteintech, 21,799–1-AP, 1:100) antibodies. This incubation step facilitated specific binding of the antibodies to their respective protein targets in preparation for downstream analysis. After adding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, the membranes were incubated for 1–2 h. Image Lab software was utilized for investigation after the immunosignals were found employing a chemiluminescent substrate (Millipore, WBKLS0050). CCK8 assay A controlled incubator with 5% CO₂ was used to maintain the cells at 37 °C after they were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 3 Determination of intracellular lactate After culturing ovarian cancer cells for 24 h, samples of cell lysates or culture supernatants were collected. Lactate levels were then quantified by measuring absorbance at 450 nm using the Lactate Assay Kit-WST (Dojindo), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Soft agar assay Cell confluence was around 50% at the following day after seeding in 6 cm dishes. After being detached, the cells were made into a suspension. 1.25% agar (40%), 2 × RPMI 1640 (Basal Medium Eagle, 40%), and FBS (20%) were used to produce the lower layer. Each well was then filled with 400 μL of the Mixture, which was then left to solidify at 37 °C. The cell suspension was Mixed with the prepared upper layer. Each well was then filled with 400 μL of this Mixture, which contained roughly 1× 10 3 Reporter assay Cells were seeded in a 12-well plate and reached the 50% confluence. Then, they were co-transfected with Renilla luciferase (0.02 μg), 0.05 μg of reporter plasmid, and 0.1 μg of expression vector. The reporter’s activity was measured 24 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Beyotime, RG088M). The experiment was performed three times. Immunoprecipitation assay Using lipofectamine 8000, transfection was performed to determine how exogenously expressed proteins interacted. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection using IP lysis buffer that contained 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The resulting supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with HA beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88,836) and Flag beads (Sigma, A2220). The beads were incubated with 1 × loading buffer and heated for 5 min the next day after being cleaned three times with a wash buffer that contained 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 1% NP-40. The supernatant was subjected to a western blot analysis. IP lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors was used to lyse the cells to find relationships between endogenously generated proteins. After the supernatant was collected, it was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of primary antibody. It was then incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 40 μL of Protein A/G beads (bimake.com, B23202 Statistical analyses SPSS version 23.0 and GraphPad Prism version 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) were used for the statistical analyses. A statistical test that was employed to analyze the data was the two-tailed Student’s t P Results Overexpression of EMSY upregulates LDHA and promotes acidification of the culture medium In the cell culture, we noted that the supernatants of the culture medium from ovarian cancer cells OVCA429 and OVCA433, which overexpress exogenous EMSY (Flag-EMSY), exhibited a more rapid yellowing (Fig. 1 1 1 1 Fig. 1 Overexpression of EMSY promotes lactate production. A B C D P P Overexpression of EMSY upregulates LDHA protein levels We first employed qPCR and Western blot to examine the effects of EMSY overexpression on LDHA expression at both protein and mRNA levels. The data showed that increasing EMSY levels upregulated LDHA mRNA and protein (Fig. 2 B 2 D 2 Fig. 2 Overexpression of EMSY upregulates LDHA expression. A B C D E P Knockdown of EMSY downregulates LDHA expression The effects of EMSY knockdown on LDHA expression were first examined using qPCR and Western blot. The studies demonstrated that OVCA429 and OVCA433 cells, cells with ovarian cancer, had lower levels of LDHA mRNA and protein when EMSY expression was knocked down (Fig. 3 B 3 3 Fig. 3 Downregulation of EMSY inhibits LDHA expression. A B C D P EMSY promotes ovarian cancer cell growth in an LDHA-dependent manner To investigate whether EMSY’s oncogenic role in ovarian cancer relies on its regulation of LDHA, we performed LDHA knockdown in EMSY-overexpressing OVCA429 cells. Experimental results demonstrated that silencing LDHA in these cells nearly abolished the pro-growth effects of EMSY overexpression on anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 4 B 4 Fig. 4 Knockdown of LDHA reverses the tumor-promoting effect of EMSY. A B A C P ## P β-Catenin regulates LDHA through EMSY-dependent mechanisms Our previous work and this study demonstrated an interaction between β-catenin and EMSY (Fig. 5 5 5 D 5 D Fig. 5 EMSY interacts with β-catenin to regulate LDHA expression. A B C D P ## P Discussion Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells, distinguishing them from normal cells [ 17 18 Glycolysis sustains tumor growth and chemoresistance through multifaceted mechanisms [ 19 19 20 21 22 22 Ovarian cancer stem cells (CSCs) depend on glycolysis to maintain stemness. Ovarian CSCs exhibit suppressed mitochondrial function, favoring glycolysis over oxidative metabolism [ 23 24 25 Oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation majorly impact tumor metabolic reprogramming [ 26 27 16 28 The regulatory effect of EMSY on lactate production might influence protein lactylation modification. Currently, it has been found that RAD51 and PFKP [ 29 30 In conclusion, this study shows that EMSY plays a metabolic regulatory role in ovarian cancer cells, indicating that LDHA could be a therapy target for ovarian malignancies that have EMSY amplification.
