Methods A multicenter retrospective analysis was conducted across eight Japanese university hospitals, including 124 patients (81 with covered and 43 with uncovered SEMS). Treatment outcomes, recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO), survival, and treatment‐related adverse events (tAEs) were compared. Results The rates of technical success (100% vs. 100%) and clinical success (94% vs. 98%) were comparable between the two groups. However, the incidence of RBO was significantly higher in the uncovered SEMS group compared to the covered SEMS group (37% vs. 20%, p p p Conclusion Laser‐cut SEMS demonstrated similar efficacy to braided stents in the management of MDBO. The covered laser‐cut SEMS was associated with a lower RBO rate than the uncovered SEMS. Additionally, Laser‐cut SEMS can be removed if it is fully covered. covered laser‐cut metal stent malignant distal biliary obstruction removability uncovered pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date April 2026 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  T.

The study was approved by the ethics committee at each participating institution (H20‐0002). The study protocol was publicly accessible for opt‐out on the participating institutions’ websites. 2.2 Patient Selection 2.2.1 Inclusion Criteria This study included consecutive patients who underwent covered or uncovered laser‐cut metal stent (X‐SUIT NIR; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) placement for unresectable MDBO between September 2014 and December 2018. All patients had MDBO confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or computed tomography (CT) and presented with obstructive jaundice or cholangitis requiring biliary drainage. Malignancies were confirmed through pathological examination. 2.2.2 Exclusion Criteria Patients younger than 20 years, pregnant individuals, and those with stents placed outside the bile duct were excluded. 2.3 Procedure Endoscopic stent placement was performed under conscious sedation with midazolam and pethidine hydrochloride. A duodenoscope (TJF‐260 V, JF‐260 V [Olympus Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan], or ED‐580T [Fujifilm Medical Corp., Tokyo, Japan]) was used for the procedure. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was primarily conducted with an MTW catheter (MTW Endoskopie, Wesel, Germany) or a Swish catheter (Swish, TSK Laboratory, Japan). Guidewires, including the 0.025‐inch VisiGlide 2 (Olympus Medical Systems), EndoSelector (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA), and 0.035‐inch Seekmaster (Piolax, Tokyo, Japan), were used for bile duct identification and SEMS insertion. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD), or endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by balloon dilation (ESBD) [ 15 16 17 Tumor invasion of the cystic duct orifice was defined based on tumor extension around the cystic duct as confirmed by CT or MRCP, or the presence of biliary irregularities causing cystic duct narrowing as observed by ERCP. In this study, we aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of covered and uncovered laser‐cut self‐expandable metal stents (SEMS) using the X‐SUIT NIR, which has an identical structure except for the presence of a covering. Both covered and uncovered X‐SUIT NIR stents are fabricated by laser‐cutting a nickel‐titanium alloy. The covered X‐SUIT NIR features a silicone and polyurethane membrane on its outer surface (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Images of the laser‐cut self‐expandable metal stent (SEMS), X‐SUIT NIR, used in the present study. (A) Images of covered (left) and uncovered (right) X‐SUIT NIR. Both stents have the same structural design, with the covered stent featuring a silicone and polyurethane membrane on its outer surface. (B) High‐magnification view of a segment of the uncovered laser‐cut SEMS. Yellow circles indicate pointed shapes. 2.4 Definitions and Outcomes AEs and outcome definitions were based on the Tokyo Criteria 2024 [ 18 18 Technical success was defined as the successful placement of the stent in the intended location. Clinical success was defined as a 50% reduction or normalization of bilirubin levels or the resolution of cholangitis within 14 days after stent placement. AEs were defined as any events requiring conservative treatment, medication, intervention, or hospitalization, in addition to RBO. The total number of each AE was recorded, and the overall AE rate was calculated as the number of patients experiencing at least one AE divided by the total number of patients. RBO was defined as a composite endpoint, including stent occlusion or migration resulting in recurrent biliary obstruction or other conditions requiring biliary drainage or stent removal. TRBO was estimated using Kaplan‐Meier curves and compared between the two groups using the log‐rank test [ 13 2.5 Statistical Analysis Clinical data were collected until May 31, 2020, and subsequently finalized. Due to the revision of the Clinical Research Act in 2021, ethical considerations in the study design were modified during the study period. As a result, some ethics committees required additional time to reapprove the research. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 30.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables are presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and were analyzed using the Mann‐Whitney U test. Factors associated with RBO that showed significance in the univariate analysis were further evaluated using binary logistic regression.

Eighty‐nine patients (72%) had never undergone ERCP and were classified as having a naïve papilla. In contrast to naïve papilla cases, in almost all non‐naïve papilla cases (35 patients), biliary drainage had been performed with either a plastic stent or a naso‐biliary tube before laser‐cut stent placement. The frequency of prior drainage was significantly higher in the covered stent group, while in the uncovered stent group, only one case underwent prior drainage via the percutaneous transhepatic route. The primary etiologies of malignant distal biliary obstruction were pancreatic cancer in 68 patients (55%), bile duct cancer in 25 (20%), gallbladder cancer in six (5%), and other types of cancer in 25 (20%). The median length of biliary stricture was 20 mm (IQR: 15–35), and 67 patients (54%) exhibited pancreatic duct dilation. Tumor invasion of the cystic duct orifice was observed in 45 patients (36%), while duodenal invasion was present in 26 patients (21%). Sixty‐nine patients (56%) received chemotherapy, and 24 (19%) were on antithrombotic therapy. 3.2 Results of Stent Treatment Technical success was achieved in all patients (100%), and clinical success, defined as improvement in jaundice, was achieved in 118 patients (95%) (Table 2 TABLE 2 Results of the treatment.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Regarding stent type selection, covered SEMS were used in 81 patients (65%). Three of the eight participating hospitals exclusively used covered SEMS, while the remaining five hospitals used both covered and uncovered SEMS. The choice of stent type was at the discretion of the endoscopist. Papillary manipulation, including EST (60%), EPBD (22%), and ESBD (18%), was performed in 102 patients (82%) before stent insertion. Stents were placed across the papilla in 85 patients (68%). RBO occurred in 32 patients (26%), comprising stent migration in three patients (2%), stent occlusion in 27 patients (22%), and stent removal due to other reasons in two patients (2%). Among these, 13 patients underwent an attempt to remove the occluded stent, and all cases (100%) were successfully removed. The median time to stent removal was 113 days (IQR: 22–176 days), with the longest duration before removal being 418 days; however, this stent was removed without difficulty. Reintervention following RBO included SEMS replacement in 19 patients (59%), plastic stent placement in eight (25%), additional percutaneous drainage in one (3%), and stent cleaning or no treatment in four (13%). Treatment‐related AEs were observed in 16 patients (13%), including pancreatitis in eight patients (6%), cholecystitis in six (5%), and hemorrhage in two (2%). Among the eight cases of pancreatitis, two cases (25%) required SEMS removal within a few days after ERCP. Five cases (63%) were classified as mild, while the remaining three cases (37%) were moderate, as hospitalization was prolonged by approximately one week. All eight patients recovered completely. Cholecystitis occurred in four patients with cholangiocarcinoma, two with pancreatic head cancer, and one with gallbladder cancer. All seven cases were classified as moderate and required percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) or EUS‐guided gallbladder drainage (EUS‐GBD). Among these cases, cancer invasion of the cystic duct was observed in three patients. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of cholecystitis in relation to cystic duct invasion ( p The two cases of hemorrhage were both mild and occurred in patients who were not on antithrombotic therapy. In both cases, hemostasis was successfully achieved with simple compression. During the observation period, 99 patients (80%) died. 3.3 Comparison of Outcomes between Covered and Uncovered SEMS Covered SEMS were placed in 81 patients (65%), while uncovered SEMS were used in 43 patients (35%). When comparing patient characteristics between the two groups, cases with a naïve papilla were more frequent in the uncovered SEMS group, and the median length of biliary stricture was also longer in this group (Table 1 2 The rate of RBO was significantly higher in the uncovered SEMS group than in the covered SEMS group (37% vs. 20%, p p p S1 Asymptomatic stent migration due to tumor shrinkage was observed in 5 cases in which covered SEMS were placed. Stent removal was attempted only in the covered SEMS group, and all 13 stents were successfully removed (Table S2 There was no significant difference in the rate of treatment‐related AEs between the two groups. However, pancreatitis did not occur in the uncovered SEMS group and tended to be less frequent in this group compared with the covered SEMS group (10% vs. 0%, p 3.4 TRBO and Patient Survival Curves between Covered and Uncovered SEMS TRBO (Figure 2 3 FIGURE 2 Kaplan‐Meier curves for time to recurrent biliary obstruction (TRBO) comparing covered and uncovered laser‐cut self‐expandable metal stent (SEMS). The median cumulative TRBO was 567 days (95% confidence interval, 525–608 days) for covered SEMS and 459 days (95% confidence interval, 340–577 days) for uncovered SEMS. Although the difference was not statistically significant ( p FIGURE 3 Kaplan‐Meier curves for patient survival comparing covered and uncovered laser‐cut self‐expandable metal stent (SEMS). The median cumulative patient survival was 277 days (95% confidence interval, 155–398 days) for covered SEMS and 227 days (95% confidence interval, 72–381 days) for uncovered SEMS. No significant difference was observed between the groups ( p The median cumulative TRBO was 567 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 525–608 days) for covered SEMS and 459 days (95% CI: 340–577 days) for uncovered SEMS. Although the difference was not statistically significant ( p 2 Similarly, the median cumulative patient survival was 277 days (95% CI: 155–398 days) for covered SEMS and 227 days (95% CI: 72–381 days) for uncovered SEMS. There was no significant difference in patient survival between the two groups ( p 3 We also examined the impact of chemotherapy (Table S3 S4 4 Discussion In this study, stent placement succeeded in all 124 patients. Although braided stents usually achieve a 97%–99% success rate [ 5 7 19 4.1 Stent Migration and Removability Stent migration occurred in eight patients (6%), all with covered stents; five were asymptomatic due to tumor shrinkage, and three caused RBO. A systematic review reported a 9.8% symptomatic migration rate for covered stents [ 20 4 21 Covered stents were removed in all 13 attempted cases (Table S2 8 11 4.2 Drainage Efficiency Covered laser‐cut SEMS showed significantly lower RBO rates than uncovered stents. In multivariate analysis, stent type was the only independent factor, mainly due to fewer stent occlusions. Tumor ingrowth was significantly more frequent in uncovered stents, explaining their higher RBO incidence, consistent with prior reports on braided stents [ 2 TRBO did not differ significantly between groups, likely due to the limited sample size. Based on Yamashita et al. [ 2 11 22 4.3 Adverse Events The overall AE rate did not differ significantly between groups, but pancreatitis was less frequent with uncovered SEMS ( p 23 24 S4 4 One covered SEMS case showed a stent fracture. Although not linked to RBO or AE here, fractures can cause bile duct injury or kinking [ 25 4.4 Limitations This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective design led to unequal case distribution between covered and uncovered SEMS groups; a randomized trial is needed to confirm these results. Second, the sample size was small, which may explain why the Kaplan–Meier curves suggested but did not show a significant TRBO difference. Third, ERCP procedures varied across hospitals, introducing potential selection bias in stent choice and RBO management. 5 Conclusion Since the X‐SUIT NIR stent is unavailable, the present results should be regarded mainly as mechanistic insights into covered versus uncovered laser‐cut SEMS, potentially informing future stent development and application. Laser‐cut SEMS showed efficacy comparable to braided SEMS for malignant distal biliary drainage, with lower RBO rates in covered than uncovered SEMS. Covered laser‐cut SEMS may also migrate less than covered braided SEMS. However, long‐term use requires caution due to possible stent fracture.
