Artificial intelligence (AI) has delivered significant advances in protein structure prediction, but its utility for identifying cancer drivers is less explored. We evaluate multiple computational methods for identifying cancer driver mutations. For re-identifying known drivers, methods incorporating protein structure or functional genomic data outperform methods trained only on evolutionary data. We validate variants of unknown significance (VUSs) annotated as pathogenic by testing their association with overall survival in two cohorts of patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( N KEAP1 SMARCA4 It remains unclear whether machine learning methods can accurately identify cancer driver alterations. Here, the authors compare machine learning-based approaches to other computational methods to determine their utility for annotating variants of unknown significance and identifying driver alterations in real-world cancer patient data, demonstrating superior performance.

Digital health records and widespread tumor genomic profiling offer a means to bypass traditional functional assays and study the impact of tumor mutations, including VUSs, directly using patient data 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 S1 KEAP1 SMARCA4 Results Association with OncoKB driver variants We first tested the utility of VEPs in discriminating literature-confirmed or hotspot pathogenic somatic missense variants from benign ones. OncoKB-annotated pathogenic variants in the AACR Project GENIE dataset 4 S2 Benign SNPs had significantly lower scores than oncogenic mutations in all studied methods, demonstrating their ability to distinguish benign versus pathogenic mutations in cancer (Figs. 1B S3 1B 1C 25 S12 S13 We found that in general, the ensemble and deep learning-based methods outperformed the evolution-based methods (Fig. 1C 9 1C 26 14 27 1C 28 1C S4 S13 S17 S17 S17B 29 30 S16 S16B 1D It is possible that VEPs with different approaches may have complementary information that could result in better performance in predicting variant effects than any single VEP. To test this hypothesis, we trained random forest (RF) models including the outputs from 11 non-ensemble VEPs as inputs to predict variant pathogenicity. Our training and test sets included OncoKB oncogenic variants from GENIE v14 data as the positive class and randomly selected variants from dbSNP as  the negative class. Models trained and tested on population data perform better than those trained and tested on mutation level data; 5-fold CV models perform better than gene holdout models; and all models perform better in predicting TSG mutations compared to OGs (Fig. S15 p p S15C Association with known binding sites We next investigated the ability of VEPs to identify new driver mutations not previously annotated by OncoKB from the large pool of detected VUSs. In particular, we validated the potential functional impact of VUSs labeled as pathogenic by VEPs (“reclassified pathogenic”) in cancer through analyses of their impact on protein binding sites, correlation with patient outcomes, and adherence to expected driver mutual exclusivity patterns. Furthermore, we implemented success metrics on each task and compared the performance of VEPs in order to identify the best method for studying new driver mutations. Pathogenic mutations can alter protein function by disrupting interactions with other proteins and ligands 31 q 2A 2A binding S14B binding binding S14B Fig. 2 VEPs identify unannotated driver mutations. A N q N N KEAP1 N N q KEAP1 KEAP1 NFE2L2 CUL3 Association with survival To further validate VUS classifications by VEPs using real-world data, we measured the impact of mutations according to classification on overall survival (OS), focusing on patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the world’s leading cause of cancer mortality 32 KRAS STK11 KEAP1 33 36 37 S5 Known oncogenic variants 3 KEAP1 SMARCA4 2B 2B S6A KEAP1 S6B 38 S14C KEAP1 KEAP1 KEAP1 KEAP1 S14C Concurrent mutations in certain gene combinations may worsen survival in an additive manner, as is known for STK11 KEAP1 34 S9B STK11 KEAP1 KEAP1 STK11 KEAP1 STK11 S9A KEAP1 STK11 Pathway mutual exclusivity Oncogenic mutations in genes within the same oncogenic signaling pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient due to functional redundancy 39 40 40 S10A Within the NRF2 pathway, KEAP1 KEAP1 NFE2L2 CUL3 2C KEAP1 S10B ATM TP53 2C S10 In the RTK/RAS pathway, reclassified pathogenic mutations in NF1 ERBB4 IRS2 41 2C ERBB4 IRS2 S10B ERBB4 IRS2 S11A ERBB4 S11B IRS2 S11C ERBB4 IRS2 S11C ERBB4 IRS2 1 We calculated the odds ratio of reclassified oncogenic mutations, compared to reclassified benign mutations, being mutually exclusive with other known oncogenic mutations in the same pathway (OR mutex S14D 1B Discussion Results from our benchmarks suggest that there is not one single method that outperforms others across all tasks, although AlphaMissense, SIFT and PolyPhen2 demonstrate better performance than other methods in multiple tasks related to reclassifying VUSs according to our proposed metrics (Fig. S14 42 43 44 45 Our study has limitations. SNPs may have different distributions and characteristics compared to passenger mutations; thus, using SNPs as the negative set may overestimate VEPs performance in predicting mutation oncogenicity in tumors. Indeed, when we used neutral somatic variants as annotated by OncoKB instead of SNPs as the negative class, prediction performance declined across all methods (Figure S17 Overall, our findings underscore the potential of VEPs in identifying driver mutations in cancer as evidenced through their success at several benchmarks based on real-world data. VEPs can help to quickly expand the set of potential driver variants in genes with potential therapeutic significance such as KEAP1 46 47 SMARCA4 48 49 Methods This study complies with all relevant ethical regulations as approved by the Institutional Review Board of MSKCC. Patients and data collection This study analyzed patients with tumor genomic sequencing from two sources: The MSK-IMPACT cohort and the AACR Project GENIE cohort, which includes patients from the MSK-IMPACT cohort. MSK-IMPACT The MSK-IMPACT cohort comprised patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering (New York, NY), an academic cancer hospital with tumor genomic sequencing using MSK-IMPACT, an FDA-authorized tumor genomic profiling assay, which uses matched white blood cell sequencing to filter clonal hematopoietic and germline variants. All MSK patients were enrolled as part of a prospective sequencing protocol ( NCT01775072 For patients in the MSK-IMPACT cohort, demographic and clinical information, including tumor stage, age, sex, race and histology were retrieved from the electronic health records database. Breakdown of demographic characteristics is presented in Table S5 50 53 54 GENIE Details of the AACR Project GENIE cohort have been published previously 4 2 GENIE BPC Genomic and clinical data for a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the AACR GENIE cohort have been recently published as part of the AACR GENIE Biopharma Collaborative (BPC) 37 Genomic landscape Genomic data, including mutational calls, copy number alteration and structural variant data, for the GENIE v.14-public cohort were obtained from Synapse. All genomic alterations were annotated with OncoKB version 4.2 (release date February 10, 2023). Genes were labeled as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes using the OncoKB Cancer Gene List (updated October 2, 2023). For genomic landscape analyses involving gene-level counts, only patients with tumor sequencing panels including a given gene of interest were included in the respective analysis. Non-oncogenic variants Non-oncogenic missense mutations were randomly selected from the dbSNP Human Variation Sets build 150 (April 2017) labeled as having “no known medical impact.” This dataset includes variants with germline minor allele frequency of ≥ 0.01 and no records of clinical phenotypes in ClinVar. We annotated all variants with the same methods as described below and selected 7474 variants with the highest number of available annotations from 14 VEPs. These non-oncogenic variants served as the negative class in subsequent receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. Predicting established pathogenic variants We evaluated the performance of 14 variant function prediction methods and one human variant archive for recapitulating known oncogenic cancer variants as annotated by OncoKB, the first FDA-recognized somatic molecular knowledge database for this purpose. Methods were chosen to be included from a diverse range of approaches based on their recent development and conceptual advancements (including methods with recent release dates e.g. AlphaMissense, PrimateAI and ESM1b, as well as more updated methodology to an old approach, e.g. EVE’s deep generative model to predict pathogenicity based on evolutionary conservation), superior performance compared to other methods in the same class (e.g. REVEL and CADD outperformed other VEPs in multiple comparison studies 23 24 9 55 12 29 30 56 S1 Annotation schema OncoKB annotations were performed with version 4.2 (released February 10, 2023). Prediction scores for most VEPs, except BoostDM and CHASMplus and ClinVar were obtained from dbNSFP 43 https://www.intogen.org/boostdm/search 29 q First, EVE provides variant classifications at different degrees of uncertainty, aiming to maximize accuracy by excluding variants that the model is uncertain about. For example, a Class25 EVE classification means that 25% of the most uncertain variants were excluded when making predictions 28 After cutoffs were determined, we applied them to the VEPs’ predicted scores to stratify variants into categories. For CADD, PrimateAI, REVEL and VARITY_R_LOO, variants with scores higher than or equal to the determined thresholds were classified as pathogenic and vice versa. For ESM1b, variants with scores smaller than or equal to the determined thresholds were classified as pathogenic. We repeated this process for all datasets, resulting in data-specific cutoff and EVE uncertainty thresholds. The cutoffs used are summarized in Table S2 Receiver operating curves (ROCs) We performed two ROC analyses, 1. Weighting all positive variants equally and 2. To better understand method performance in a manner that reflects actual population levels of a given mutation, sampling positive variants from the GENIE cohort, i.e. appearing proportionally to their frequency in a real-world population. In the first analysis, mutation-level ROC for each method was constructed using all 8033 OncoKB-oncogenic missense mutations as the positive class and 7474 dbSNPs as the negative class. In the second analysis, population-level ROCs were constructed using all occurrences of OncoKB-oncogenic missense mutations in the GENIE v14-public cohort as the positive class ( N N N Ligand binding and protein-protein interaction residues analysis Residues involved in binding ligands, including small molecules, peptides, DNA and RNA, were retrieved from BioLiP2 57 58 Pathway analysis Mutual exclusivity test Pathway analyses were done on the ten canonical oncogenic signaling pathways, including cell cycle, Hippo, Myc, Notch, Nrf2, PI-3-Kinase/Akt, RTK-RAS, TGFβ signaling, p53 and β-catenin/Wnt 40 https://www.cell.com/cms/10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.035/attachment/73b4efd7-1e36-4e1f-874b-db6bc0a18ec4/mmc3.xlsx 40 For each gene within a pathway, we aimed to identify whether reclassified pathogenic mutations in that gene are mutually exclusive with known oncogenic mutations in all genes within the same pathway. The result of this analysis demonstrates that reclassified pathogenic mutations have comparably pathogenic effect on a pathway as known oncogenic mutations. To this end, we calculated one versus all mutual exclusivity for each gene for patients with NSCLC in the MSK-IMPACT cohort. For each test, we first set up a 2 × 2 contingency table with two variables: the number of patients carrying reclassified pathogenic mutations in that gene, and the number of patients carrying oncogenic mutations in all genes within the same pathway. A two-sided Fisher’s exact test was applied to the contingency table to test for mutual exclusivity. An example contingency table used to test for pathway mutual exclusivity between KEAP1 KEAP1 CUL3 NFE2L2 Mutations in KEAP1 Reclassified pathogenic VUSs/no mutation Mutations in KEAP1, CUL3 and NFE2L2 Known oncogenic VUSs/no mutation In particular, this table is used in a Fisher’s exact test for mutual exclusivity between KEAP1 NFE2L2 CUL3 The procedure was repeated for all genes present in a given pathway, and for all eight methods. P-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Tests with a logOR < 0 and adjusted p As negative controls, we tested for mutual exclusivity between reclassified benign mutations and known oncogenic mutations in all genes in a given pathway using the same procedure.

For patients with multiple sequencing events, the first was used as the time of cohort entry. To adjust for confounding variables between comparison groups, inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were calculated using covariate values at baseline, including tumor stage, age, sex, race, histology, smoking history, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability status (MSI), prior treatment and metastatic sites if any, before fitting Cox PH models. An example plot of standardized mean differences in covariates before and after IPTW matching to demonstrate how IPTW helps achieve balance in covariates between comparison groups is presented in Fig. S5 Hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals and p Kaplan-Meier curves Weighted Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were constructed to further examine the relationship between gene-level pathogenicity annotations and overall survival for genes with significant hazard ratios in univariate weighted Cox PH models. Similar to the Cox PH regressions, KM curves were calculated from time of diagnosis to time of death or last follow-up, left truncated at time of cohort entry (tissue sequencing). Patients were stratified based on the presence of OncoKB oncogenic, ‘reclassified’ pathogenic, ‘reclassified’ benign mutations or without any mutation in each gene of interest. Only strata with ≥ 10 patients were included. KM curves were weighted using the same IPTWs used for the corresponding Cox PH regression. STK11/KEAP1 concurrent mutation analysis To test whether AlphaMissense reclassified pathogenic variants in STK11 KEAP1 KEAP1 STK11 KEAP1 STK11 KEAP1/STK11 Random forest ensemble Random forest ensembles were fitted using the R caret Before training, scores from each method were normalized and standardized to ensure consistency and comparability across the different methods. The ‘preProcess’ function in ‘caret’ was employed for this purpose, applying z-score normalization to center and scale the data. Two cross-validation strategies were employed for model training: 1. randomly sampled 5-fold cross-validation and 2. gene holdout cross-validation. In the 5-fold cross-validation approach, the training set was randomly partitioned into five subsets. The model was trained on four subsets and validated on the remaining subset, rotating this process five times to ensure each subset served as the validation set once. In gene holdout cross-validation, variants were grouped by gene, and entire genes were withheld during training to serve as a validation set, assessing the model’s ability to generalize to unseen genes. Model performance was evaluated using metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Additionally, feature importance was assessed to determine the contribution of each method’s scores to the overall model performance.
