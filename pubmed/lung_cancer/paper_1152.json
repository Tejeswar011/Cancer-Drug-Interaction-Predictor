Introduction Cancer remains a significant threat to human health worldwide. Among 22 categories of diseases and injuries, cancer is the second leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a novel tumor treatment method that has evolved significantly over the past few decades. The fundamental principle of PTT involves the use of photothermal agents (PTAs) that convert near-infrared (NIR) laser light into localized hyperthermia within tumor tissues to induce cell death [ 7 8 9 2 10 2 11 12 13 14 In this review, we summarize the synthesis of NIR-II PTAs, including metal nanomaterials, metal sulfide/oxide nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials, quantum dot semiconductor polymers, and organic molecules ( Figure 1 Figure 2 2. NIR-II Photothermal Agents PTAs play a crucial role in PTT. Most materials that absorb in the NIR-II window can convert NIR-II irradiation into heat with a specific efficiency constant known as photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). However, ideal PTAs should exhibit a high PCE to induce hyperthermia capable of killing tumor cells within the permissible laser dose. Furthermore, photothermal stability, biocompatibility, ease of modification, and biodegradability within the body are significant considerations for PTAs [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Table 1 2.1. Inorganic Agents Generally speaking, inorganic substances exhibit numerous desirable attributes, including enhanced photosensitivity, electrical conductivity, optical characteristics, magnetic properties, and thermal behavior. They serve not only as drug delivery systems but also as vehicles for therapeutic agents. Beyond these benefits, inorganic agents are readily synthesizable, possess a large surface area, and exhibit stable mechanical and chemical properties [ 22 23 24 25 26 26 2.1.1. Metal Nanomaterials Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are the most commonly used PTAs in PTT due to their tunable surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks, good biocompatibility, and stability. Among various AuNPs architectures, gold nanorods are particularly prominent as their aspect ratio-dependent SPR peaks can be precisely adjusted across both the NIR-I and NIR-II windows. The pioneering work by the Masuda team, which first synthesized gold nanorods via electrochemical reduction, marked a breakthrough and ignited extensive exploration into shape-controlled synthesis of gold nanostructures [ 27 28 2−x 29 2 2 30 2 2 In recent years, hollow gold nanostructures have emerged as a focal point of research due to their unique physicochemical properties. Compared to solid AuNPs of comparable size, hollow architectures not only exhibit a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio but also demonstrate significantly enhanced plasmonic characteristics through plasmon hybridization effects [ 31 32 33 34 35 Figure 3 36 37 Figure 4 2.1.2. Metal Sulfide/Oxide Nanomaterials Due to their excellent free electron transfer properties and structural integrity [ 38 39 2 40 9 8 41 9 8 The unique vacancy structure of copper sulfide, along with the LSPR induced by the oscillation of conduction electrons, provides a promising avenue for studying PTT in NIR-II. Ke et al. synthesized Cu 2 2 42 2 2 2 2 2 Figure 5 2 Figure 6 43 Figure 6 44 45 2 4 2 4 46 2 2 4 47 48 2 2−x 49 50 2 2 51 2 52 Metal oxides have garnered significant attention due to their photothermal properties. Recent studies have revealed the photothermal effect of Fe 3 4 53 54 55 56 3 4 57 2 58 2 2 59 2 2.1.3. Carbon-Based Nanomaterials Carbon-based nanomaterials, primarily consisting of carbon nanotubes and graphene, have garnered significant interest due to their low biotoxicity, affordable manufacturing costs, high PCE, and multifunctional surface modification properties. These attributes have facilitated their widespread application in cancer PTT [ 60 61 2 62 63 64 In terms of biological applications for the in vivo reduction in tumor volume, Zhao et al. developed water-dispersible nanoparticles incorporating two nanographene-porphyrin hybrids (NGP-1-NPs and NGP-2-NPs). These nanoparticles exhibit strong absorption in the NIR windows, achieving high photothermal conversion efficiencies of 69% [ 65 Additionally, the lower the radiation exposure required for PTT in the NIR-II region, the greater the biological safety of the treatment. Xu et al. synthesized a hollow carbon nanosphere modified with polyethylene glycol-graft-polyethylenimine (HPP) that serves as an NIR-II-responsive PTA ( Figure 7 66 Figure 7 2 2.1.4. Quantum Dots Quantum dots (QDs), defined as zero-dimensional nanostructures exhibiting three-dimensional quantum confinement, have emerged as pivotal materials in biomedical applications [ 67 68 69 70 71 2 72 73 74 75 76 77 Concurrently, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted attention as biocompatible organic semiconductors with tunable bandgaps and versatile photophysical properties, including photoluminescence and photothermal conversion [ 78 79 80 81 82 83 Figure 8 84 2.2. Organic Agents Organic photothermal agents (OPTAs) offer superior biocompatibility compared to inorganic photothermal agents (IPTAs), as they avoid the toxic effects associated with non-releasing inorganic ions. This makes OPTAs particularly advantageous for addressing long-term biosafety concerns. In the following, we will introduce polymer-based photothermal agents (PPTAs) and small-molecule photothermal agents (MPTAs) [ 24 85 2.2.1. Semiconductor Polymers Semiconducting polymers have emerged as crucial materials in PTT due to their unique structural and performance advantages [ 86 87 88 89 90 PBTPBF-BT 91 In addition to their photothermal properties, these materials also exhibit selective tumor ablation capabilities. A notable example is the organic photothermal nanoagent SPN I–II 92 I–II I–II 2.2.2. Organic Molecules Organic molecule PTAs remain challenging due to their synthesis difficulty and photothermal stability ( Table 2 93 94 95 96 Polypyrrole (PPy) nanomaterials have garnered significant attention due to their high conductivity, excellent stability, good biocompatibility, and ease of synthesis. These materials possess considerable potential as photothermal coatings for various PTT, offering a promising approach to enhance nanoscale PPy-functionalized coatings in medical systems [ 97 98 99 100 99 101 98 Conjugated small molecules, characterized by their electron-delocalized structures and light-harvesting capabilities, have recently demonstrated significant advantages in light absorption and amplification. Li et al. engineered D-π-A-π-D conjugated small molecules (IR-TT, IR-TS, and IR-SS) using a Se-tailoring strategy to red-shift the light-harvesting peak from the NIR-I to the NIR-II window [ 102 2 pharmaceutics-17-01178-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Summary of the properties and applications of representative NIR-II PTT materials discussed in this review (Ex, excitation wavelength (nm); PCE, photothermal conversion efficiency (%); ΔT, temperature increase (°C); NA, not applicable).

Combination of PTT and PDT PDT is a treatment strategy that relies on the interaction between light, molecular oxygen (O 2 103 104 105 To address the challenges posed by hypoxia, PTT serves as a complementary approach [ 106 107 108 109 110 111 Among emerging advances, high-efficiency NIR-II type-I PDT/PTT systems have been developed to address the limitations of hypoxic tumor environments. For instance, Wen et al. synthesized and characterized three donor-acceptor semiconducting polymers based on chalcogen elements: PTS, PTSe, and PTTe. These polymers demonstrated strong NIR-II absorption properties, with PTTe NPs exhibiting superior PCE and enhanced ROS generation (specifically superoxide anion radicals, O 2 − 112 In another study, Tian et al. synthesized carbon nitride nanoparticles (CN-NPs) through the copolymerization of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) with melem at elevated temperatures [ 113 2 2−x 2 114 2−x 2 These advancements highlight the potential of combining PDT and PTT in a single nanoplatform, leveraging NIR-II-responsive materials to overcome the limitations of traditional therapies. The development of multifunctional nanomaterials paves the way for innovative and effective cancer treatments, particularly in hypoxic and deep-seated tumor environments. 3.2. Combined PTT and Immunotherapy Cancer immunotherapy leverages the body’s natural defense mechanisms to identify, attack, and eliminate cancer cells. Currently, innovative approaches such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) strategies [ 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 Hyperthermia ablation of tumors can result in cancer cell death in an immunogenic manner [ 141 142 143 2 144 + 145 + 146 147 2 148 145 Ma et al. engineered photothermal converters by self-assembling AuNPs on fluid liposomes [ 149 In conclusion, the integration of PTT with immunotherapy not only improves the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors but also stimulates systemic anti-tumor immunity. These synergistic strategies possess substantial potential for enhancing cancer treatment outcomes. 3.3. Combined PTT and Chemotherapy Chemotherapy, a classical clinical approach for treating both primary and metastatic tumors, primarily utilizes cytotoxic agents such as doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cisplatin to induce apoptosis or necrosis in tumor cells [ 150 151 152 153 154 155 The stimuli-responsive properties of nanocarriers enable spatiotemporally controlled drug release. Sun et al. synthesized a porous bimetallic Au@Pt core-shell nanostructure using the polymer micelle template method, subsequently incorporating DOX into the mesopores of the Au@Pt nanostructure with the aid of phase change materials (PCM). This process ultimately led to the formation of an Au@Pt-DOX-PCM-PEG nanotherapeutic drug designed for NIR-II activated chemotherapy [ 156 2 2 2 157 2 2 2+ 2+ The synergistic strategy of combining chemotherapy with PTT not only enhances local therapeutic efficacy but also reduces systemic toxicity through microenvironment-responsive regulation. This approach marks a significant advancement in the field of precision oncology. 4. Clinical Progress of PTT For decades, the development of effective cancer therapeutics has been a major focus of biomedical research. Conventional approaches, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, remain foundational treatments; however, they are frequently associated with significant side effects and suboptimal therapeutic outcomes, particularly in advanced malignancies [ 158 159 24 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 Table 3 Figure 9 4.1. Skin Cancer Skin cancers can be classified into two main types based on their cell of origin: melanoma skin cancer, which arises from melanocytes, and non-melanoma skin cancer, which originates from keratinocytes. Non-melanoma skin cancers are further categorized into basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) according to their severity [ 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 173 174 4.2. Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed malignancy in men and the fifth leading cause of death worldwide [ 168 175 176 177 178 179 4.3. Breast Cancer Although advances in early diagnosis and treatment have significantly reduced breast cancer mortality over the past few decades, it remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. According to the latest data from the American Cancer Society, breast cancer constitutes 31% of all new cancer diagnoses in women, while lung cancer accounts for only 13% [ 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 4.4. Liver Cancer Liver cancer is a prevalent tumor of the digestive system and ranks as the sixth most common cancer worldwide [ 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 4.5. Lung Cancer Lung cancer has emerged as the malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in men and the second leading cause in women [ 198 199 200 201 162 pharmaceutics-17-01178-t003_Table 3 Table 3 Examples of tumors treated clinically with photothermal therapy.

Conclusions With the in-depth research into precision medicine, NIR-II-PTT has shown promising application prospects across various scenarios. The combination of NIR-II-PTT with PDT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy has significantly expanded the potential applications of PTAs, particularly those operating within the NIR-II window, for tumor treatment. As research progresses on near-infrared second-region photothermal agents, clinical researchers will have access to an increasing number of viable and reliable photothermal agents, enabling them to investigate their applicable scenarios and therapeutic effects in clinical settings. During this process, clinical researchers will also articulate more detailed requirements for near-infrared two-region photothermal agents, thereby promoting their development. In summary, photothermal agents in the near-infrared second region exhibit very promising prospects in photothermal therapy and in the synergistic treatment of photothermal therapy with other modalities. Future interdisciplinary research involving nanomaterials and clinical medicine holds significant potential.
