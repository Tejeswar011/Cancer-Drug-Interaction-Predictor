Introduction Tamoxifen was initially identified as a contraceptive named ICI 46,474 by Dora Richardson et al. in 1962, and today it stands as the benchmark treatment for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer [ 1 The ongoing pursuit aims to identify novel disease indications for tamoxifen or enhance its therapeutic efficacy through molecular modifications. While tamoxifen shows promise across a broad range of diseases, efforts are underway to develop modified derivatives that surpass the parent compound. Ferrocene, or carbo- and heterocycles, can be attached to the pharmacophore base of tamoxifen, augmenting its properties. Ferrocene linkage imparts advantageous redox properties [ 2 3 A previous publication by our research group described two tamoxifen derivatives with improved antitumor effects compared to the parent molecule. This research article is a close continuation of our previous experimental series [ 4 To briefly summarize our previous publication, we tested out tamoxifen, T5, and the racemate of the planar chiral T15 (ferrocene-linked derivatives) ( Scheme 1 Immunocytochemistry revealed that the cell lines used in our experiment significantly differ in their estrogen receptor expression profile. The three most well-known estrogen receptor isoforms are the ERα, Erβ, and the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1). ERα stands out as the predominant nuclear ER isoform, with pathological diagnostics continuing to assess tumor ER positivity primarily based on ERα presence. In contrast, ERβ, another nuclear ER isoform, exhibits higher expression in breast and endometrial tissues but holds less significance in their physiological proliferation compared to ERα. Despite abundant data on ERβ expression, its exact role in breast cancer development and progression remains unclear. Our findings indicate that all three cell lines express ERα, whereas only MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 express ERβ. G-protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor 1 (GPER1) represents a distinct estrogen receptor isoform, functioning as a Gs-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor. However, its cellular localization remains debated, with conflicting evidence suggesting either plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum localization [ 5 6 The introduction of the ferrocene component enhances the cell viability, decreasing the impact of tamoxifen on both breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. The drugs of this study exhibit the ability to halt the cell cycle, albeit in a concentration-dependent manner. This means that cell cycle arrest prevails at concentrations below the compound’s IC 50 Further investigation has unveiled several potential mechanisms contributing to the observed effects of the ferrocene-linked tamoxifen derivatives. The primary pathway they engage in depends on the tumor’s estrogen expression profile. In MCF7 cells, where all three isoforms of ER are present, the antagonistic effect on ER-α predominates. However, the presence of GPER1 inhibits the full effectiveness of tamoxifen by upregulating several tumor-protective proteins. Conversely, in MDA-MB-231 cells, where only ERβ is notably expressed, tamoxifen’s antagonistic effect on this isoform is clearly prominent. In PANC1 cells, only GPER1 expression is detectable. PANC1 was selected as a representative aggressive and ER-independent model. While the observed antitumor effects induced by tamoxifen can be attributed to non-estrogen-receptor-dependent mechanisms, the tumor-protective pathways induced by GPER1 interfere with these off-target effects. The ferrocene-linked novel tamoxifen derivatives, T5 and T15, can mitigate the tumor-promoting effects induced by GPER1 through direct viability, decreasing the effect resulting from oxidative stress [ 4 Differences in the rotational freedom of the molecules may also be a determining factor in the varying antitumor effects of ferrocene-containing derivatives observed on breast and pancreatic tumor cell lines. Due to this rotational flexibility, these compounds may bind differently to the various ER receptor isoforms expressed in our different tumor cell lines. In the present study, we also investigated another tamoxifen derivative with a different structure in terms of rotational freedom, namely T6 ( Scheme 2 7 As shown in Scheme 3 8 9 10 The main aim of this study was to further broaden our knowledge of the molecular mechanism behind the increased antitumor effect of the ferrocene-linked drugs (T5 and T15) and compare it with a new, indene-based tamoxifen derivative, T6 ( Scheme 2 2. Results 2.1. Cell Viability, Cell Cycle Analysis and ROS Production After T6 Treatment Before comparing the molecular mechanisms of action of the different tamoxifen derivatives, the effects of T6 on cell viability, cell cycle progression, and ROS production were investigated in the tested tumor cell lines and compared to our previously published results for the ferrocene derivatives and the parent compound. In the case of T6, the prevention of rotation inside the bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl) fragment showed a cell line-specific preference in enhancing a cell viability decrease compared to the parent molecule. While the indene-based T6 molecule resulted in a worse IC 50 50 Table 1 Regarding how it affects the cell cycle progression, T6 showed no significant effect on PANC1 cells in 24 h ( Figure S1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figures S1 and S2 T6 significantly elevated ROS production on all three investigated cell lines, but only in the highest measured concentration ( Figure 2 Figure 2 50 2.2. Apoptosis Induction On MCF7 cells, tamoxifen induced apoptosis at the highest concentration. Treatment with the ferrocene-linked T5 and T15 derivatives predominantly raised the number of late apoptotic cells. In contrast, the indene-based T6 derivative induced a smaller proportion of early apoptotic cells but led to a more pronounced accumulation of late apoptotic cells ( Figure 3 Figure S3 On MDA-MB231 cells, tamoxifen had no significant effect on apoptotic cell death. The ferrocene-linked derivatives led to significantly higher amounts of both early and late apoptotic cells. Similarly, T6 treatment resulted in an elevated proportion of late apoptotic cells ( Figure 3 Figure S4 On PANC1 cells, only the ferrocene-linked T5 induced apoptosis, with the highest concentration causing a marked rise in late apoptotic cells. The other examined compounds had no apoptotic effect on this cell line ( Figure 3 Figure S5 2.3. Cell Cycle Regulator Expression Profile In this set of experiments, we measured the mRNA levels of 24 target genes as a screening to find potential biological connections between ER-related and off-target pathways as well. Thresholds for fold-change in gene expression can vary depending on the biological response and sensitivity of the cell line to treatment, which were primarily determined by the previously measured IC50 values. In this study, a 10-fold change threshold was used for PANC1 cells in response to T5 and T15, which are cytotoxic and have low IC50 values. These substances are highly potent, and small changes in gene expression can trigger significant biological effects, justifying the lower threshold. For T6, which induces G2/M arrest despite a higher IC50, a 50-fold change threshold was applied, as it requires larger changes in gene expression to significantly affect the cell cycle. For MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, which are less sensitive (higher IC50), a 50-fold change threshold was used. These cells show weaker responses to treatment, requiring larger changes in gene expression to be biologically meaningful. Tamoxifen did not alter the expression of cell cycle regulators in MCF7 cells ( Figure 4 CCNA1 CCNA2 CCNB2 CCND2 CDC25A CDC25B TFDP1 Figure 5 E2F5 RBL2 Figure 6 On MCF7 cells, T5 downregulated the expression of CCNA1 CDK4 Figure 4 E2F2 RBL1 CCNB1 CCND3 CDC25C CDK6 CCNA1 E2F2 CCNA1 Figure 5 Figure 6 T15 treatment on MCF7 cells led to the upregulation of CCND1 CDC25B E2F3 CDK2 CDK4 Figure 4 CCNA1 CCNA2 E2F2 E2F3 Figure 5 CCNA1 Figure 6 The indene-based T6 derivative decreased the levels of CCNA1 CDC25A TFDP1 Figure 4 CCNA1 CCND1 CCNE1 CDC25C CDK2 Figure 5 CCND2 CCNA1, CDC25C E2F2 Figure 6 2.4. Oxidative Stress Pathway Regulator Expression Profile By summarizing our present and previous results on ROS-inducing activity of the tamoxifen derivatives, T15 proved to be the most potent promoter of ROS production in our experimental setup, so it was selected as the model compound for this part. Results regarding the ROS production elevating properties of tamoxifen and T15 were previously published by us [ 4 On MCF7 cells, tamoxifen treatment elevated the expression of NOS1 GAPDH MPO CD36 NOS1 MPO ROS1 NOS1 BCL2 INS CYP2E1 SOD3 Figure 7 Treatment with T15 upregulated the expression of NOS1 NOX1 GAPDH IL1B PTGS2 SERPINE1, PARK7 HSPD1 PRDX3 HIF1a GAPDH LDHA GPX1 PRDX1 UCP1 ROS1 SOD1 CYP2E1 Figure 7 2.5. Apoptotic Regulator Protein Levels Protein levels of 35 different regulators of the apoptotic process were measured on MCF7 cells after treatment with tamoxifen, T5, T15 and T6. This cell line was chosen as the experimental model for this measurement as it expresses all three major ER isoforms. Tamoxifen treatment upregulated CytC, Hsp70 and Hsp 60, while downregulating the levels of DR4, DR5 and Fas. The ferrocene-linked T5 elevates the expression of HO1, but lower levels of CytC, DR4, DR5, FADD, Fas, PON2 and SMAC were observed following treatment. T15 treatment upregulates DR4, DR5, FADD, HO1 and Hsp27, while downregulating CytC, Hsp60, Hsp70, and SMAC. The indene-based T6 derivative elevates the expression levels of CytC, DR4, DR5, Fas, Hsp27, Hsp60, Hsp70, PON2 and SMAC but lowers FADD and HO1 protein levels ( Figure 8 Table 2 3. Discussion In the present study, we summarize all the findings that help to understand the mechanisms underlying the increased antitumor effect of the ferrocene-linked drugs (T5 and T15) and the new, indene-based tamoxifen derivative (T6), on different cancer cell lines, modeling high-mortality tumor types. Cell viability assays revealed that the inclusion of a ferrocene or an indene moiety enhances the antiproliferative impact across all examined cell lines. The underlying mechanism behind this favorable antitumor effect can be approached from two perspectives. The chemical structures—most importantly the differences in the rotational freedom of the molecules—are a key factor in the antitumor effect of ferrocene-containing derivatives. Due to the rotational flexibility, they might bind differently to the various ER subtypes. We attribute these shifts partly to ligand conformational plasticity and rotational freedom introduced by the ferrocenyl moiety. Modern ER literature emphasizes that subtle changes in ligand geometry/dihedrals control helix-12 positioning and co-regulator recruitment, producing different transcriptional outputs and resistance phenotypes. This applies to SERM scaffolds such as 4-OHT and becomes even more relevant in the presence of ERα mutations that stabilize active-like helix-12 conformations [ 12 13 The ferrocene unit itself contributes additional low-barrier cyclopentadienyl-ring rotational modes and acts as a conformational hinge when embedded in flexible linkers, broadening the set of ligand poses available in the ER pocket and, by extension, the signaling states that can be stabilized. Recent physical–organic and med-chem studies directly document ferrocene’s ring-rotation dynamics and its use as a dynamic linker element that modulates molecular folding and cell permeability—features consistent with the pose diversity we infer for T5 and T15 [ 14 15 Previous studies have shown that not only tamoxifen but also its ferrocene-linked and halogenated [ 16 17 18 18 19 In our previous study, we confirmed that all three cell lines express ERα; however, only the MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines expressed ERβ. In PANC-1 cells, only GPER1 was detectable, while this receptor showed the highest expression in MCF7 cells. Tamoxifen, categorized as a SERM, acts as either an agonist or antagonist on ER, depending on tissue type and the cellular ratio of the different isoforms [ 20 21 22 Cell cycle analysis was conducted to determine whether the compounds induce apoptosis or necrosis (resulting in the elevation of the subG1 population in the flow cytometry measurement) or induce cell cycle arrest. It should be noted that the concentration where each derivative was used was 25 µM. Derivatives only affected the progression of the cell cycle on cell lines where the IC50 value was higher than 25 µM; where it was lower, they increased the count in the subG1 group. We demonstrated that both T5 and T15 were capable of inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase of breast cancer cells [ 4 The incorporation of an indene moiety into tamoxifen analogues enhances their anticancer properties through several key mechanisms. Firstly, replacing the C-phenyl ring of tamoxifen with an indole or oxindole scaffold improves the compound’s binding affinity to ERα, thereby enhancing its antagonistic effect on estrogen-driven proliferation. Secondly, it might increase the activation of caspase-8 and the induction of apoptosis [ 23 The phases of the cell cycle are regulated by the different ER subtypes, whose roles depend on the exact phase. ERα and ERβ act as general mitogen stimuli and play a crucial role at the very beginning of the G1 phase, leading to the assembly of the CDK4/6-Cyclin D complex [ 24 19 25 26 27 28 29 30 Tamoxifen’s primary action is through the nuclear subtypes of ER. In MCF7 cells, tamoxifen had minimal impact on cell cycle regulators; however, it induced an S phase arrest. On PANC1 cells, tamoxifen increased the expression of E2F5 and RBL2, but this shift in regulators did not result in a cell cycle arrest. In MDA-MB-231 cells, tamoxifen significantly downregulated key regulators such as CCND2 and TFDP1, both of which result in a G1 phase arrest [ 31 32 33 34 The T5 and T15 derivatives, both based on ferrocene, exhibited strong effects on cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G1 phase. T5 treatment led to the downregulation of CCNA1 and the upregulation of CDK4, suggesting that this is why it may inhibit G1 phase progression [ 35 36 T15, the other ferrocene-based compound, upregulated CCND1, CDC25B, E2F3, CDK2 and CDK4 in MCF7 cells, which are regulators of the G1/S transition [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 The T6 derivative, based on an indene structure, induced a G2/M arrest in PANC1 cells, while it had no effect on the cell cycle progression on the other two cell lines, mainly expressing the nuclear ER subtypes. In PANC1 cells, T6 upregulated CCND2 but decreased the expression of CCNA1, CDC25C, and E2F2, suggesting a dual-phase effect on the cell cycle, promoting G1 progression while inducing G2/M arrest. This dual-phase regulation by T6 is consistent with literature showing that indene-based compounds can regulate both G1 and G2/M checkpoints [ 44 45 46 ROS production elicited by tamoxifen and its ferrocene-linked derivatives were already measured, and we were keen to explore how the indene-based derivative with specific conformational flexibility compares to these molecules. Contrary to expectations from the literature, T6 showed a strong oxidative potential on MCF7 cells; however, only at the highest concentration. Based on our overall results, we chose the ferrocene-linked T15 for exploring the oxidative stress regulator expression profile, as this one showed the most potent and widespread oxidative stress-inducing capability on our cell lines. We hypothesized that there is a basic difference between the molecular background of the ROS production-promoting capability of tamoxifen and its ferrocene-linked derivative, T15, depending on the cellular model. On the mainly Erα-expressing MCF7 cells, tamoxifen acts through the higher expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), which are both Erα-induced targets [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 20 57 T15 can likely interact with the different estrogen receptor isoforms, as it retains the same pharmacophore region as the parent molecule. Elevated levels of NOS1 SOD3 CYP2E1 Ferroptosis is a distinctive form of cell death driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation. The incorporation of a ferrocene moiety into different therapeutic agents enhances the possibility of this special kind of cell death [ 58 59 60 61 62 One of the ROS regulators that showed high elevation upon T15 treatment was NOX1. It has been shown that NOX1 generates ROS in neurons by catalyzing the reaction between NADPH and oxygen molecules. Additionally, overexpression of NOX1 promotes autophagy associated with ferroptosis (ferritinophagy) [ 61 63 Parkinson’s protein 7 (PARK7), which was significantly induced by T15 in MDA-MB231, is widely expressed and plays a variety of roles in pathological conditions. PARK7 directly combats oxidative stress by undergoing oxidation at its Cys106 residue. Additionally, it prevents ferroptosis by modulating the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism, ROS regulation, and iron homeostasis. PARK7 also stabilizes Nrf2, a key transcription factor that regulates the antioxidant response, further enhancing the cell’s defense against oxidative damage and ferroptosis. Conversely, when ROS levels rise excessively, Nrf2 can initiate various forms of programmed cell death, including ferroptosis. [ 64 In close connection with the above-mentioned ROS production and a possible ferroptosis-inducing capability, the novel tamoxifen derivatives also activate the classical routes of apoptosis. The ferrocene-linked agents (T5 and T15) have a stronger cell-viability-decreasing effect on PANC1 and MCF7 cells compared to tamoxifen, while the indene-based T6 derivative had the best IC 50 When apoptotic mechanisms are activated, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into the cytosol. In this new location, it either initiates the caspase cascade within the intrinsic apoptotic pathway or contributes to the amplification of extrinsic apoptotic signaling [ 65 66 Heat shock proteins Hsp27, Hsp60 and Hsp70 are molecular chaperones whose expression levels rise in response to various stressors. These proteins play a protective role, assisting cells in surviving potentially fatal conditions [ 67 68 The drugs investigated in this article not only affect the previously described common regulators of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but they also influence the extrinsic pathway. We can hypothesize a mechanism of action based on the effects of tamoxifen derivatives on the expression of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Death receptors, members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, are located on the cell surface and become activated upon binding to specific ligands. Their activation triggers a signaling cascade culminating in the formation of the Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) with the help of the intracellular death domain (DD) of the receptor and adaptor proteins like the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). DISC recruits and activates initiator caspases [ 69 70 52 71 72 73 74 While the aim of this article was to characterize the derivatives from an in vitro experimental point of view, we would have liked to look into, whether there are studies with ferrocene-modified or indene-based tamoxifen analogues moving towards in vivo experiments. As of today, no ferrocene- or indene-based tamoxifen derivatives are in clinical trials or FDA-approved. Tamoxifen family agents that have reached the clinic include endoxifen, investigated in Phase II/III trials (ongoing, ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02311933 75 Table 3 Table 4 76 77 78 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Synthesis of the Novel Tamoxifen Derivatives The synthesis and detailed chemical characterization of the indene-based T6 tamoxifene analogue have been reported in a previous publication [ 16 4 4.2. Cell Lines and Culturing The effects of tamoxifen and its derivatives were investigated on three cell lines, which were obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, UK). All cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 ® PANC1 (87092802 ECCAC) is a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line established from a pancreatic carcinoma of ductal origin from a 56-year-old Caucasian male. This cell culture was maintained in the supplemented Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Lonza Group Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). MCF7 (86012803 ECCAC) is an ER-positive breast adenocarcinoma cell line established from the pleural effusion of a 69-year-old Caucasian female. MCF7 cells were cultured in supplemented Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), also containing 1% Non-Essential Amino Acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). MDA-MB-231 (92020424 ECCAC) is an ER-negative breast adenocarcinoma cell line also established from pleural effusion. Culturing of this cell line was performed with supplemented Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Lonza Group Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). NHDF cells (C-12300 Sigma-Aldrich) are isolated from the dermis of juvenile foreskin or adult skin from different locations. Culturing of this cell line was performed with supplemented Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Lonza Group Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). 4.3. Cell Viability Assays The xCELLigence SP system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) is an impedance-based method that allows real-time monitoring of different cell biological properties, such as a quantitative readout of cell number, proliferation rate, cell size and shape, and cell-substrate attachment quality. Adherent cells, such as PANC1 and MCF7, attach to the bottom of the wells and disrupt the electric current between the microelectrodes found on the bottom, which generates an increased impedance signal higher than the background signal of the system. Upon treating the cells with T6, the cells acquire a round shape and detach from the bottom, which restores the electric current between the microelectrodes, and with it, the measured impedance value decreases. A relative and dimensionless parameter, the cell index (CI), can be calculated from the detected impedance change by the following formula: CI = (Zi−Z0)/F where Zi is the impedance at a given time point, Z0 is the impedance at t = 0 h, and Fi is a constant depending on the frequency (F10kHz = 15). To allow real-time measurement, the system was placed in an incubator at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 50 The viability of MDA-MB-231 cells after treatment with T6 was determined by AlamarBlue assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Watham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction at 72 h following treatment. Cells were seeded at a 10,000/well concentration. After 4 h of incubation with the fluorescent reagent, the fluorescence intensity was measured with a LS-50B Luminescence Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK). Each data point represents the average of three parallel measurements. IC 50 To determine the IC 50 50 4.4. Cell Cycle Analysis FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure the DNA content of cells with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) intercalated stoichiometrically to the double-stranded DNA. The cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a concentration of 250,000 cells/mL. After 24 h of incubation, they were treated with T6 at a concentration of 25 µM, as this was the EC 80 The samples were centrifuged and resuspended in RNase (100 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 7.8). Propidium iodide was added to the sample at 10 μg/mL concentration right before the flow cytometric measurements, collecting 25,000 cells/sample. Data were analyzed by CellQuest Pro (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) and Flowing 2.5.1 (Turku Centre of Biotechnology, Turku, Finland) software. For aggregate and debris discrimination, the FL2-Width vs. FL2-Area plot was used, and the gated cells are displayed in the FL2-Area histogram to assign percentage values to each population of cell cycle stages. Statistical analysis was performed with MS Excel and OriginPro 2018 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). 4.5. ROSGlo Assay Cells were seeded in a white-walled, clear-bottom 96-well plate at a concentration of 10,000 cells/well, in 70 μL culture medium. After 24 h of incubation at previously described conditions, each well was treated with 10 μL of T6 at a concentration of 0.5, 2.5 and 25 μM. Culture medium and DMSO (<1 vol%) were used as controls, and 600 nM of Bortezomib was used as a positive control. Each data point represents the average of 3 parallel measurements. Components of the ROSGlo assay (Promega, Southhampton, UK) were prepared and added according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence was measured 24 h upon treatment with Fluoroskan TM 4.6. Measuring Apoptosis Induction Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a concentration of 100,000 cells/well. After 24 h of incubation, they were treated with tamoxifen, T5, T15 and T6 at a concentration of 0,5, 2,5 and 25 µM of the chosen compound. Cells were then harvested after 24 h of treatment and were resuspended in Annexin Binding Buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Catalog number: V13246) and labeled with either FITC-conjugated Annexin V (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Catalog number: A13199) or 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD—Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Catalog number: A1310). Labeled samples were then incubated at room temperature for 10 min in a container isolated from light. FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure the signal intensity from both dyes. Data were analyzed by CellQuest Pro (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) and Flowing 2.5.1 (Turku Centre of Biotechnology, Turku, Finland) software. Statistical analysis was performed with MS Excel and OriginPro 2018 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). 4.7. Characterizing the Expression of Apoptosis Regulating Proteins MCF7 cells were seeded in Petri dishes in 10 mL of culture medium at a concentration of 1.5 million cells/dish. After 24 h of incubation in the previously described conditions, cells were treated with 25 uM of tamoxifen, T5, T15 or T6. Culture medium and DMSO (<1 vol%) were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after treatment, cells were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 1000× g g 4.8. Measuring the Expression of Cell Cycle and Oxidative Stress Regulating Factors The change in the expression of regulating factors upon treatment was determined by real-time quantitative PCR after mRNA isolation and cDNA preparation. Cells were seeded to 12-well, uncoated, clear-bottom plates at a concentration of 200,000 cells/well in 1 mL of culture medium. After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with T6, T5, T15 or tamoxifen at a final concentration of 25 μM. Culture medium and DMSO (<1 vol%) were used as negative controls. After 24 h, mRNA was isolated from the treated cells by the Quiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Quiagen Sciences, Germantown, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s manual. The total mRNA concentrations were measured with the NanoDrop 1000 UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Then cDNA was prepared with the SensiFAST cDNA Synthesis Kit (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For mRNA expression, the predesigned Biorad Oxidative Stress Tier 1 H96 and Biorad Cell Cycle Generic H96 plates (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) were used. Plates were prepared according to the manufacturer’s manual, with each well containing 10 nmol cDNA. Experiments were performed in triplicate, with each one originating from a different biological sample, seeded at the same time. Plates were then measured with the Biorad CFX 96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). For later statistical analysis, three housekeeping genes— GAPDH TBP HPRT GAPDH TBP GAPDH 4.9. Statistical Analysis For statistical analysis, Origin Pro 8.0 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) and MS Excel software were used. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (Fisher’s LSD) post hoc test was performed. A p p p p n 5. Conclusions Previous series of experiments performed by our research group have already proved that the added ferrocene moiety decreases the cell viability compared to treatment with tamoxifen on breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. The newly introduced T6 indene-based molecule with modified conformational flexibility also has a lower IC 50 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph18091417/s1 Author Contributions M.K. coordinated the experiments, generated and analyzed the data, and prepared the original draft.
