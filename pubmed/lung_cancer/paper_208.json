Introduction Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, has emerged as a major public health concern following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although initially perceived as a respiratory illness, growing biomedical evidence confirms that COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems. This study aimed to explore the clinical manifestations, risk factors, and long-term outcomes associated with long COVID and to identify patients at highest risk. The research also contributes to the ongoing discourse on establishing a unified definition of long COVID. Methods A secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, community-based study was conducted using data from 168 households, representing a weighted total of 14,769 households in Third Ward, Houston, Texas. Data were collected via interviewer-administered surveys and included variables on demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, COVID-19 symptom severity, and post-acute symptom persistence. Symptom variables were recoded as binary indicators, and weighted logistic regression models were applied to identify associations between acute phase characteristics and the development of long COVID. Results Risk factors significantly associated with long COVID included symptom severity during acute infection (OR = 29.58, 95% CI [1.38, 632.53]), heart disease (OR = 6.00, 95% CI [1.15, 31.28]), asthma (OR = 3.49, 95% CI [1.05, 11.59]), and poor physical health (OR = 4.20, 95% CI [1.12, 15.75]). Acute symptoms predictive of long COVID included anxiety (OR = 22.94, 95% CI [2.01, 262.31]), chest pain (OR = 7.15, 95% CI [1.13, 45.23]), constipation (OR = 16.81, 95% CI [1.33, 213.23]), heart palpitations (OR = 6.59, 95% CI [1.08, 40.18]), and shortness of breath (OR = 4.97, 95% CI [1.16, 21.36]). No statistically significant associations were found between long COVID and race, education, or income. Conclusion The findings underscore the multisystemic nature of long COVID, characterized by a diverse range of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive impairment, shortness of breath, and neuropsychiatric issues such as depression. While clinical factors are critical in understanding long COVID, the results also suggest that addressing associated health outcomes requires broader consideration of social determinants of health. long COVID post-acute sequelae of SARS-cov-2 (PASC) symptom severity comorbidities risk factors The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

CDC WHO NICE Current study Symptoms that last longer than 4 weeks as “Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19” or “long COVID” ( 7 Illness that occurs in people with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually within 3 months (12 weeks) from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months ( 8 Signs and symptoms that occur more than 4 weeks and post-COVID syndrome for symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks after infection ( 9 Our definition of long COVID was based on a combination of those experiencing symptoms at least 30 days (4 weeks) beyond infection and Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) and long COVID are used interchangeably. CDC=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; WHO=World Health Organization; NICE = National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. While it was initially thought that COVID-19 was only respiratory in nature, numerous biomedical reports have shown that it has had a multisystemic adverse impact on almost all systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, dermatological, musculoskeletal, nervous, and metabolic systems ( Table 2 Table 2 Long COVID symptoms and the impacts on numerous organs with differing pathology.

Table adapted and reproduced (public domain) from Davis et al. ( 1 Based upon a conservative estimated incidence of 10%, it is assumed that at least 65 million individuals worldwide have long COVID-19, with undocumented cases likely resulting in a gross underestimate of the actual disease burden ( 1 10 Long COVID has been associated with a wide range of disease severities, female sex, high viral load, and a high percentage of diagnosis between ages 36 and 50 in non-hospitalized patients ( 10 3 11 Accessing adequate resources, support, medical assessment, and treatment for long COVID has been a challenge, particularly for those with no laboratory evidence of their infection. During the earlier onset of the pandemic, it is thought that only 1–3% of cases before March 2020 were detected due to testing being less readily available to those who were not hospitalized, undiagnoses, and inadequate assessmend of symptoms ( 1 6 12 13 The natural history of COVID-19 does appear to improve gradually over time in most cases. However, some patients require a comprehensive assessment to exclude serious complications underlying their symptoms. In contrast, others who survived hospitalization and ICU admission and those with preexisting conditions may require more specialized care. Given the paucity of evidence, it is still challenging to determine which symptoms and issues related to long COVID are caused by the disease itself and which may be unrelated but more difficult to treat due to COVID and its after-effects. To further compound these challenges, COVID-19 and its long-term sequelae are not only influenced by clinical health factors but by non-clinical determinants such as race, income, education, access to healthcare, and structural inequalities of racism and discrimination ( 14 Caring for persistent symptoms of COVID-19 increases hospitalization and financial burden for patients and the healthcare system ( 15 16 While some risk factors, such as immunosuppression, are not modifiable, others, like the social determinants of health may be. As such, addressing clinical health factors also requires exploring the socioeconomic inequities underpinning them. In many societies’ income, education, occupation, and race/ethnicity are proxies for socioeconomic position ( 17 18 Figure 1 Figure 1 Characteristics associated with the development of long COVID. Adapted for use from Berger et al. ( 14 Diagram showing characteristics associated with Long COVID. Central node labeled \"Characteristics Associated with Long COVID\" connects to four categories: Sociocultural (language, cultural/religious/government institutions, political instability), Economic (transportation, unemployment/high-risk employment, food insecurity), Health (comorbid conditions, access to care/quality of care, cost), and Additional Stressors (caregiving, incarceration). Each category has sub-categories depicted as surrounding nodes. Most existing literature focuses on the frequency of individual symptoms instead of population-based estimations. Moreover, there is a need for the simultaneous consideration of multiple persistent symptoms and comorbidities over time. The objective of this study is to more fully (1) understand and characterize the spectrum of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (2) identify individuals who are most susceptible to the development of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 and (3) contribute to gaps in understanding epidemiological, clinical, and nonclinical risk factors that contribute to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. This study aims to evaluate the association between clinical course of disease severity, comorbidities, race, income, education, and healthcare access and the development of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 in patients seemingly recovered from COVID-19. Understanding these associations has important public health implications. It supports the prioritization of preventive measures, vaccination, and early treatment, while also offering insights into the biological mechanisms of long COVID ( 19 1 2 Methodology 2.1 Study design CASPER, a cross-sectional two-stage cluster sampling methodology, was utilized to collect the data that underwent secondary analysis. CASPER is a validated method developed for rapid needs assessment by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to rapidly obtain information about the needs of a community ( 20 2.2 Sample population and size The CASPER was conducted in the Third Ward in Houston, Texas. The Third Ward has a resident population of 38, 920 and has seen a population increase of 1.49 percent since 2020. The population by race is Black/African American (38.43%), White (30.75%), American Indian (0.56%), Asian (14.01%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.05%), Other (7.46%) and/or Mixed (8.74%). The median household income is $59,026 with 18.72% of families living below the poverty line ($23,400) for a family of four. One hundred sixty-eight unique households completed the survey instrument, representing a weighted population size of 14, 769 total households. Exploring the baseline health in Third Ward was a cornerstone of this study and was needed to explore associations between comorbid conditions and long COVID. The prevalence of disease in Third Ward prior to COVID-19 was higher than national rates for many of the health indicators selected in this study. 2.3 Study analytic plan The data used for secondary analysis was collected by an instrument that included information regarding household demographics (age, income, education, race/ethnicity, employment status), prevalence of chronic conditions (heart disease. Stroke, asthma, cancer, cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, stroke, COPD, and chronic kidney disease) and post-COVID impact (history of hospitalization, length of time since diagnosis, symptom severity, presence of persistent symptoms, outpatient visits, impact on activities of daily living). One hundred sixty-eight unique households completed the interviewer-administered survey. Each household for which an interview was completed was assigned a weight based on the household’s probability of selection. This weighting ensured that the resulting estimates were generalizable to all household in the sampling frame, with each cluster weighted equally. SAS 9.4 was utilized for the analysis allowing for appropriate multistage sample design weighting. The following weight formula was used: Weighted frequencies, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals were then calculated for each of the interview questions for cells with five or more observations. A total of 14, 769 households were included in the 77,004-sampling frame and used in the weight calculation. Once weight was assigned, frequencies and corresponding percentages were calculated for each question. 2.4 Univariate and bivariate analysis Descriptive assessments were done among the full cohort, but research questions (inferential statistics) were only conducted and among weighted households ( N Bivariate (crude) and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to determine associations between risk factors and long COVID. Five separate logistic regression models were constructed with unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) reported for each risk factor, where applicable. The study outcome was a binary measurement of the development of post-acute sequalae of COVID-19. The variable long COVID was created together by a combination of those experiencing symptoms at least 30 days beyond infection and having been diagnosed at least 12 weeks (3 months) prior to the survey. Odds ratios were obtained, and confidence intervals were used to determine whether statistical significance had been reached. 2.5 Cleaning of imported data and variable recoding Due to limited data, some variables (household income and educational level) required recoding. In the original survey instrument, respondents were asked to “check all that apply” to indicate the presence of COVID-19 symptoms. For analysis, each symptom variable was separated, and a binary yes/no response was created. 2.6 Statistical methods for the study outcomes Potential risk factors for COVID-19 were identified using existing literature, clinical expertise and the Charlson Comorbidity Index, supplemented by additional comorbidities documented in prior studies ( 21 Table 3 Table 3 Research questions and variables by level of measurement and statistical analysis performed.

Both bivariate (crude) and multivariable logistic regression models were employed to determine these associations. The study outcome was a binary measurement of the development of post-acute sequalae of COVID-19. The variable long COVID was created together by a combination of those experiencing symptoms at least 30 days beyond infection and having been diagnosed at least 12 weeks (3 months) prior to the survey in accordance with the CDC definition for long COVID.

After adjusting for age; age and race; and age, race, and income, individuals who experienced severe acute COVID-19 symptoms had nearly 30 times higher odds of long COVID (OR = 29.58; 95% CI: 1.38–632.53) compared to those with mild symptoms. Even moderate symptoms were associated with elevated odds (OR = 2.64) ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Adjusted odds of long COVID by acute symptom severity. Line graph showing adjusted odds ratios on a logarithmic scale, with categories: mild, moderate, and severe. The odds ratio increases progressively from mild to severe, with error bars indicating variability at each point. After adjustment for covariates, individuals who reported heart disease had significantly higher odds of developing long COVID compared to those without heart disease (OR = 6.00, 95% CI [1.15, 31.28]). Although asthma was significantly associated with long COVID in the unadjusted (crude) model, the association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment (OR = 3.49, 95% CI [1.05, 11.59]). Poor physical health remained a significant predictor of long COVID after adjusting for age and race, with affected individuals exhibiting 4.20 times higher odds of developing the condition compared to those reporting good physical health (OR = 4.20, 95% CI [1.12, 15.75]). These findings underscore the importance of preexisting cardiovascular and general health conditions in the risk profile for long COVID. The association between symptoms experienced at any time during infection and symptoms experiences thirty days or more after infection and long COVID was also explored. This provided additional valuable insight into the conditions that may exacerbate the development of long COVID. Those who experienced anxiety at any time during their infection were 22.94 times higher odds developing long COVID after adjusting for age and race (OR = 22.94, 95% CI [2.01, 262.31]) and those who experienced chest pain at any time during their infection were at increased odds of developing long COVID after adjusting for age, race, income, and health insurance coverage (OR = 7.15, 95% CI [1.13, 45.23]) in comparison to those who did not experience those symptoms during infection. Those who experienced constipation at any time during their infection were 16.81 higher odds of developing long COVID in comparison to those who did not experience constipation (OR = 16.81, 95% CI [1.33, 213.23]). Those who experienced heart palpitations (OR = 6.59, 95% CI [1.08, 40.18]) and shortness of breath (OR = 4.97, 95% CI [1.16, 21.36]) were 6.59 times higher odds of developing long COVID after adjustments for age, race, income, and access to healthcare. By contrast, no statistically significant associations were observed between long COVID and sociodemographic factors such as race, education, income, or access to healthcare in either the crude or adjusted models. 4 Discussion This study contributes important insights into the prevalence, characteristics, and risk factors of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as long COVID, among a community-based population in Third Ward, Houston. Notably, it highlights the significant associations between symptom severity during acute infection and specific comorbidities and symptoms with the likelihood of developing long COVID. Specifically, severe symptoms during initial infection, comorbid conditions such as heart disease and asthma, and physical and psychological symptoms like poor physical health, anxiety, chest pain, constipation, heart palpitations, hypersomnia, and shortness of breath were associated with increased likelihood of long COVID. Conversely, socio-demographic characteristics such as race, income, education level, and access to healthcare did not show significant associations with the development of long COVID in adjusted models. These findings emphasize that the manifestation of long COVID is more intricately linked to clinical health experiences than to socio-economic disparities, although the latter may still play an indirect role in healthcare access and disease management. 4.1 Acute symptom severity The relationship between severe acute COVID-19 and subsequent long COVID is affirmed by the findings. Individuals who experienced severe symptoms had nearly 30 times higher odds of developing long COVID compared to those with mild symptoms, consistent with prior research ( 1 22 22 4.2 Comorbidities The significant association of heart disease and asthma with long COVID adds to existing literature recognizing chronic comorbidities as risk enhancers ( 23 24 22 13 25 4.3 Symptom clusters The presence of specific acute symptoms, particularly anxiety, chest pain, heart palpitations, constipation, hypersomnia, and shortness of breath, demonstrated strong associations with long COVID. This mirrors the symptom clusters identified by the FAIR Health ( 10 26 4.4 Sociodemographic factors and health equity Interestingly, while this study included a racially diverse sample with a majority of African American respondents, race and ethnicity were not significantly associated with long COVID. This finding diverges from some national-level studies, such as those by Jacobs et al. ( 27 22 28 4.5 Healthcare access and economic factors Another important finding is the absence of significant associations between long COVID and educational attainment, income, and healthcare access. While surprising, this may reflect limitations in the survey design or the complexity of long COVID, where individual biological and clinical experiences outweigh traditional socio-demographic predictors. Notably, over 78% of households in the study lacked health insurance, and 16% reported difficulty accessing care, often due to financial barriers. These structural constraints may have affected both the reporting and experience of long COVID, contributing to potential underdiagnosis or delayed treatment. 4.6 Vaccination data and viral strains The role of vaccination was not directly addressed in this study, which is a limitation. Our study occurred at a time when testing and vaccination coverage varied widely, thus the instrument utilized did not capture vaccine status. Research from Antonelli et al. ( 29 Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a reduction in the risk of developing long COVID, although the magnitude of this effect varies depending on the study design and operational definitions used. Several studies suggest a protective role, but results are nuanced. Antonelli et al. ( 29 Other studies using broader or more clinically validated definitions have reported stronger effects. For instance, a population-based cohort analysis by Krishna et al. ( 30 31 32 33 Given the heterogeneity in study findings, our study acknowledges the importance of incorporating vaccination status into long COVID assessments. Although our data did not initially include this variable, its significance as a potential confounder or effect modifier is noted, and we recommend that future studies incorporate vaccination history. Despite the lack of vaccination data, the timing of infections in the study provides valuable insights. Most participants experienced symptoms more than a year before the survey, indicating that long COVID persisted over time. The transition from early variants to Delta and Omicron introduced changes in symptom profiles, with Omicron associated with higher transmissibility but lower severity ( 29 4.7 Multisystemic impact and clinical implications The multisystemic nature of symptoms reported—ranging from neurological and gastrointestinal to cardiovascular—confirms the wide-ranging impact of long COVID observed in other studies ( 1 34 35 36 4.8 Mental health burden Psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression, also emerged as prevalent among respondents. This aligns with findings from Houben-Wilke et al. ( 25 12 4.9 Gastrointestinal symptoms Notably, gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation, were significantly associated with long COVID, confirming emerging literature that documents persistent GI symptoms even months after infection ( 35 34 4.10 Interpretation and public health relevance The study highlights a complex interplay of acute symptom severity, comorbidities, and individual symptom experiences in predicting long COVID. The absence of racial, economic, and educational associations does not negate the role of structural inequities but rather points to the dominant influence of biological and clinical risk factors in this specific population. However, systemic inequities may still modulate who gets diagnosed, treated, and included in research. The lack of significant findings for diabetes contrasts with studies such as Assad et al. ( 23 37 These findings have several public health implications. First, they underscore the need for symptom-based screening tools that prioritize clinical severity and comorbid history over demographic profiling. Second, they call for community-based education and support services, especially in historically underserved neighborhoods like the Third Ward, where distrust of the healthcare system may delay care-seeking ( 38 Despite its strengths, this study has limitations that warrant consideration. Data were based on self-reported surveys, introducing recall bias and potential misclassification of respondent. The reliance on one household member to report for the entire household may lead to inaccuracies in symptom recall or comorbidity reporting. Additionally, the cross-sectional design precludes causality assessments and limits understanding of symptom progression. With respect to recovery data, our survey did not include longitudinal follow-up or specific questions regarding symptom resolution or duration. Participants were asked to report their current and past symptoms at the time of the survey, but without a time-course element, we were unable to systematically assess recovery trajectories. We plan to incorporate these elements into future studies. The absence of vaccine status, testing date, and viral strain data further restricts interpretations. Moreover, missing data and limited sample size may have underpowered the detection of some associations or contributed to unstable odds ratios. While the use of weighted data and cluster-based sampling enhances generalizability, the relatively small number of directly surveyed households ( N Nevertheless, this study contributes valuable insights to the evolving understanding of long COVID, particularly within a racially diverse and underrepresented urban population. Future research should adopt longitudinal designs, integrate clinical validation of symptoms, and examine variant-specific effects, vaccine influence, and the impact of evolving social determinants. Such work is essential for informing equitable, effective, and patient-centered responses to the long-term aftermath of COVID-19. 5 Conclusion Post-COVID conditions, also known by such terms as long COVID and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, have become an issue of growing national concern ( 10 3 Minority populations must also be more meaningfully engaged in research, however, if we are to engage minority populations more fully in research studies on long COVID and COVID-19 clinical trials, we must improve relationships between patients and providers, which may mean acknowledging implicit bias to eliminate it. This requires acknowledgment of the mistrust in the healthcare system and its impacts on the provider-patient relationship. The final recommendations involve policies that fund centers that conduct research and educate clinicians to promote collaboration between the research and the medical community. Additionally, pandemics, viruses, and infectious diseases must be integrated into curriculums not to replicate the miscues observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, health care should involve a multidisciplinary approach to address the patient as a whole in the post-COVID period and further research into the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 is needed to better understand and alter the course of disease.
