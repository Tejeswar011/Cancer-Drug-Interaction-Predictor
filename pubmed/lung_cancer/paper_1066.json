Some of these admixture events have allowed modern humans to adapt to new environments outside of Africa. Little research has been done on the impact of archaic introgression on genes associated with reproduction. In this study we report evidence of adaptive introgression of 118 genes within modern humans that have been previously associated with reproduction in mice or modern humans. We identified 11 archaic core haplotypes, three that have been positively selected, with 327 archaic alleles being genome-wide significant for a variety of traits. Over 300 of these variants were discovered to be eQTLs regulating 176 genes with 81% of the archaic eQTLs overlapping a core haplotype region regulating genes expressed in reproductive tissues. Several of the adaptively introgressed genes in our results are enriched in developmental and cancer pathways, while some have been associated with embryo development and reproductive-inhibiting phenotypes like endometriosis and preeclampsia. Lastly, we find that archaic alleles overlapping an introgressed segment on chromosome 2 are protective against prostate cancer. Our results highlight that archaic alleles show connections with important developmental pathways throughout the lifespan and may help regulate these critical processes. Modern human reproductive genes show evidence of adaptive introgression due to gene flow from Neanderthals and Denisovans in the past.

Some archaic DNA segments have been shown to be adaptively introgressed into modern human populations, where these sequences, conferring some fitness benefit, saw rapid expansion within some groups to high frequencies in relatively short evolutionary timespans. These include, but are not limited to, several immunity genes 18 21 7 22 24 25 15 22 26 27 28 29 30 Some research has explored the potential phenotypic expression of this purifying selection. Among these, one compelling discovery was a greater-than-expected number of archaic loci being removed from the modern human X chromosome relative to the other chromosomes, which may be evidence for male sterility in modern human–archaic hybrids 15 22 31 32 33 34 PGR PGR 35 While prior analysis has demonstrated both beneficial and deleterious consequences as a result of admixture, to our knowledge, there has been no widespread analysis of the role introgression has played within genes related to reproduction within modern human populations. Archaic alleles within these genes could have a significant influence on sperm or oocyte development or function, embryogenesis, and other downstream functions, such as foetal development. Therefore, research of this nature warrants analysis. Prior research targeting specific genes or phenotypes has uncovered associations with archaic ancestry, such as a high-frequency Neanderthal haplotype conveying severe COVID-19 response in South Asian populations 36 PGR 35 The use of large scale genomic datasets is becoming commonplace to help better understand admixture events in the past between modern humans and archaic hominins that may have shaped phenotypes or adaptations of modern humans (for example, McArthur et al. 24 37 33 6 38 39 5 40 Results Segments with high-frequency archaic variants We found 47 archaic segments collectively in global, modern human populations that overlap genes associated with reproduction. These segments represent 37.88 Mb (million base pairs/megabases) of sequence data with at least one archaic variant in each segment surpassing a frequency of 40% (Supplementary Data 1 23 1 1 10 41 Fig. 1 Variants recovered in adaptively introgressed reproductive genes.

Several of the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) target populations we analysed here have sample sizes below 15, a recommended minimum number of included individuals for SPrime to maintain high levels of accuracy in identifying introgressed segments 10 113 114 114 Conclusion Our study identified 47 independent segments within modern humans harbouring high-frequency archaic variants from Neanderthals and Denisovans, suggesting adaptive introgression. These segments are located within genes that have been previously described as being related to reproduction and fertility in either humans or mice 33 We were able to identify that variants overlapping genes previously described as being related to reproduction within humans and mice show pleiotropic expressions, with genome-wide significant markers exhibiting a wide array of traits. As discussed above, other studies have documented evidence of purifying selection across the genome against archaic sequences 28 30 Our analysis contributes to the study of archaic introgression and its impact on traits within the modern human genome. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of positive selection and adaptive introgression in segments of the modern human genome known to be introgressed from archaic hominins that also overlap genes associated with reproduction. Our results describe an intriguing relationship for archaic variants within a modern human genetic background. These variants are interesting due to their strong associations with developmental-related pathways, cancer incidence, and potential roles in helping indirectly balance important endogenous levels that have been previously tied to fertility outcomes. Despite these results, future work is necessary to fully understand the connections between these variants and their roles within the human genome. In conclusion, our work has clearly outlined the adaptive value of a number of variants and genes that are the direct result of admixture with archaic hominins and the roles they may have regarding human health, disease, and regulating normal development.

To begin, we calculated F ST 43 126 F ST F ST 127 128 F ST 61 Next, we used several methods capable of detecting selection on haplotypes, which identify selection based on atypical levels of homozygosity surrounding a specified region. We used Selscan v2.0.3 129 nS L 58 130 58 3B nS L 62 nS L 62 Following this, we applied two recent composite likelihood methods, RAiSD v2.9 59 60 m m m A 44 We applied an outlier approach to gauge whether any of our core haplotypes showcased evidence of selection. For each statistic, we used the genome-wide output from each population and identified values within the top 1% of the empirical distribution. In the case of two-sided tests, we calculated both the top and bottom 1% values from the genome-wide empirical distribution.
