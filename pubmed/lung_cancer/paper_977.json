See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND Narrative nursing uses narrative methods to establish an interaction between nursing staff and patients, in which the experience of the patient’s illness is understood and comprehended. By listening, the patient’s understanding, comprehension, and acceptance of their own disease symptoms, quality of life, and living conditions are understood, thereby providing a basis for formulating corresponding nursing plans for the patient, further promoting the psychological and physical rehabilitation of the patient. AIM To explore the impact of the new narrative nursing model on postoperative recovery, psychological status, and satisfaction of patients. METHODS A total of 108 patients with resectable gastric cancer who were treated from January 2024 to December 2024 were selected as the study subjects. They were divided into a routine nursing group and a narrative nursing group using a random number table method. Postoperative recovery indicators were compared between the two groups, and questionnaires and position and postoperative nausea and vomiting were conducted on the day of discharge. RESULTS There were statistically significant differences in visual analogue scale pain scores at 12-96 hours postoperatively, the time of first ambulation postoperatively, and the length of postoperative hospital stay between the two groups ( P P CONCLUSION The new narrative nursing model not only eliminated the negative emotions of patients, but also further promoted their postoperative recovery, and gained patients’ trust and satisfaction with the nursing staff.

DISCUSSION The narrative care model can reduce postoperative negative emotions in patients undergoing laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer With the acceleration of social pace, people’s lives, diet, work, etc. 13 6 14 15 16 17 Narrative nursing model can promote rapid postoperative recovery and alleviate physical pain in patients Our research results show that patients who adopt the narrative nursing model have better postoperative recovery time and less physical pain compared to the conventional nursing group, indicating that narrative nursing can compensate for the shortcomings of routine nursing[ 18 19 20 21 Narrative nursing model can improve postoperative patient satisfaction Firstly, narrative nursing provides patients with a series of personalized and refined nursing interventions. The responsible nurse fully understands the patient’s psychological state, conducts targeted health education, and guides the patient to narrate personal experiences and subjective feelings through the new model of narrative nursing, allowing the patient to vent their experiences of illness and trauma, thereby reducing the body’s stress response and avoiding the impact of negative emotions on postoperative recovery. At the same time, for postoperative patients who have already experienced a stress reaction, interventions are carried out to change their attitudes and strengthen positive self-management. Secondly, through the narrative nursing model, patients are guided on postoperative diet and activities, further promoting their postoperative recovery. Finally, by increasing the number of visits, nursing staff eliminate the unfamiliarity between themselves and the patient, bringing them closer. This not only allows patients to conveniently understand the nature of the nursing staff’s work and actively cooperate with treatment but also improves the harmony of the nurse-patient relationship, increasing the patient’s satisfaction with the nursing staff[ 22 23 We attempted to include many factors that may affect postoperative patient satisfaction in a univariate analysis and found that postoperative satisfaction was only related to postoperative nursing interventions ( P (P 4 5 24 28 P 6 1F Table 4 Univariate analysis of factors affecting postoperative satisfaction, n  Characteristic  Satisfied ( n  Dissatisfied ( n   P Interventions 0.022 Narrative nursing 58 (58.00) 1 (12.50) Routine nursing 42 (42.00) 7 (87.50) Surgical method 0.068 Laparoscopic-assisted 30 (30.00) 0 (0.00) Totally endoscopic 70 (70.00) 8 (100.00) Degree of education 0.883 Illiterate 21 (21.00) 1 (12.50) Primary school 42 (42.00) 3 (37.50) Junior/senior high school 29 (29.00) 3 (37.50) College and above 8 (8.00) 1 (12.50) History of previous surgery 0.259 Yes 36 (36.00) 1 (12.50) No 64 (64.00) 7 (87.50) Underlying diseases   0.466 No 69 (69.00) 5 (62.50) Hypertension 8 (8.00) 2 (25.00) Diabetes 8 (8.00) 0 (0.00) Chronic bronchitis 9 (9.00) 1 (12.50) Heart disease 6 (6.00) 0 (0.00) Table 5 Univariate analysis of factors affecting postoperative satisfaction, n  Characteristic  Satisfied ( n  Dissatisfied ( n   P Family history 0.080 Yes 7 (7.00) 1 (12.50) No 93 (93.00) 7 (87.50) Age (years) 0.713 ≥ 60 60 (60.00) 4 (50.00) < 60 40 (40.00) 4 (50.00) Postoperative hospital stay (days) 0.259 ≥ 10 64 (64.00) 7 (87.50) < 10 36 (36.00) 1 (12.50) SAS 0.275 Normal 65 (65.00) 3 (37.50) Mild 30 (30.00) 4 (50.00) Moderate 5 (5.00) 1 (12.50) SDS 0.499 Normal 53 (53.00) 3 (37.50) Mild 36 (36.00) 3 (37.50) Moderate 9 (9.00) 2 (25.00) Severe 2 (2.00) 0 (0.00) Gender 0.639 Male 82 (82.00) 6 (75.00) Female 18 (18.00) 2 (25.00) Self-rating depression scale scoring criteria: The cut-off value of the total crude score is 41 points, and the standard score is 53 points. A score of 53-62 indicates mild depression, a score of 63-72 indicates moderate depression, and a score above 73 indicates severe depression. Self-rating anxiety scale scoring criteria: According to the results of the Chinese norm, the cut-off value of self-rating anxiety scale standard score is 50 points, in which 50-59 is classified as mild anxiety, 60-69 is classified as moderate anxiety, and 70 and above are severe anxiety.

The specific assignments are as follows: Satisfaction (satisfied = 0, reference = 1). OR: Odds ratio; CI: Confidence interval. Potential clinical challenges of the narrative nursing model Although narrative nursing has shown significant rehabilitation benefits in this study, it still faces many challenges in actual clinical environments. For example: Clinical nursing work is heavy, and the implementation of narrative nursing requires additional time for listening, recording, and feedback, which may increase the workload of nurses; Secondly, hospitals may lack sufficient human resources or training resources to support the long-term implementation of narrative nursing, and some nurses may lack empathetic listening, affecting the effectiveness of interventions, etc. etc. CONCLUSION Through the new model of narrative nursing, the shortcomings of previous routine nursing have been compensated, further improving the psychological condition of patients after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy, eliminating the impact of negative emotions on themselves, and further promoting postoperative recovery. Through effective communication and humanistic care with nursing staff, the satisfaction of patients with nursing staff during hospitalization has been improved, which is worthy of further practice and has guiding significance in later clinical nursing work.
