In this special issue, we present a collection of studies that delve into the molecular mechanisms, therapeutic resistance, and novel treatment strategies across multiple cancer types, including lung, breast, stomach, and liver cancers. These studies not only advance our understanding of tumor biology but also provide translational insights with potentially significant clinical implications.

From endocrine-cancer interactions to resistance mechanisms and metastatic progression, these contributions advance our knowledge and open new avenues for precision oncology. We hope this special issue will inspire further research and foster translational efforts aimed at improving cancer diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. We extend our gratitude to the authors, reviewers, and editorial team for their invaluable contributions to this issue. Ducument code: A The authors reported no conflict of interests.
