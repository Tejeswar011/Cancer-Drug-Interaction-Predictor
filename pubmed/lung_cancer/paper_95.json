Background With rising interest in centralized lung cancer screening (LCS), synthesizing evidence to estimate its impact on annual adherence is critical for aligning practice with guideline recommendations. Research Question Is participation in a centralized screening program associated with higher adherence rates compared with decentralized programs among individuals with negative baseline LCS results? Study Design and Methods Seven bibliographic databases were searched for cohort studies published following January 1, 2011, reporting adherence outcomes for centralized vs decentralized LCS (primary outcome). Quality appraisal followed the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for appraising observational studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool studies. Meta-regression examined patient- and institution-level characteristics associated with adherence in centralized programs. Results Twelve studies involving 17,195 patients with negative baseline results were included in this meta-analysis. The overall pooled adherence rate in centralized programs was 55% (95% CI, 42%-58%; 12 studies, 11,302 patients) with 10 to 18 months of follow-up. Adherence was significantly higher in centralized compared with decentralized screening programs (68.9% vs 37.1%; P I 2 P z P P Interpretation Our results indicate that adherence to LCS remains low but is significantly higher in centralized screening programs compared with decentralized ones. Centralization may improve equity by addressing disparities associated with patient- and institution-level characteristics. These study findings support the expansion of centralized approaches and targeted quality improvement efforts to strengthen adherence to guideline-recommended LCS.

Pioneer trials such as the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON) trial, which reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality with LDCT imaging, achieved adherence rates > 90%. 4 , 5 6 7 8 9 , 10 5 , 11 12 13 Although current guidelines do not prioritize centralized screening programs over decentralized models, in which referring providers manage most tasks, or hybrid programs that blend both approaches, they recommend aligning LCS program structures with locally available resources. 14 15 , 16 17 18 19 With the growing interest in centralized LCS programs and their potential benefits on annual follow-up adherence, pooling current evidence to estimate their impact is critical for informing practice and aligning implementation with guideline-based recommendations. Study Design and Methods A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the association between program structure (centralized vs decentralized) and adherence to follow-up LDCT screening 10 to 18 months following a negative result on the baseline examination among high-risk individuals. This meta-analysis was reported using the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. 20 Eligibility Criteria Population Studies reporting data on high-risk individuals who underwent baseline LDCT screening and received a Lung CT Screening Reporting & Data System (Lung-RADS) score of 1 or 2 were included in the meta-analysis. Studies were included if they defined adherence as receipt of a second LDCT scan within a timeframe falling somewhere between 10 and 18 months following baseline screening with Lung-RADS 1 or 2 results. 21 Exposure Participation in a centralized screening program, defined as referral by a healthcare provider to a dedicated LCS program. Programs were classified as centralized if patients were referred to a dedicated LCS program by their providers. Comparison The study compared decentralized (ie, patients who received a direct clinician referral for baseline LDCT scans) and/or hybrid (ie, systems combining elements of both programs) programs with centralized LCS programs. Main Outcome The primary outcome was adherence to annual LCS, defined as a second LDCT scan within 10 to 18 months following a negative result on a baseline scan. Secondary measures included patient and institutional characteristics potentially associated with adherence. Study Design Only cohort studies were included in this review. For the pairwise meta-analysis comparing adherence rates between centralized and decentralized LCS programs, studies were included that reported the number of individuals who completed baseline screening and those who returned for follow-up scans, stratified according to program structure. For the meta-regression analysis, studies were included that reported adherence outcomes in centralized programs along with data on institution- or participant-level factors. Randomized controlled trials and non-original studies, including reviews, commentaries, and opinion pieces, were excluded. Information Sources and Search PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ProQuest, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases were searched for English-language articles published following January 1, 2011 (only studies published following the release of the NLST results). In addition, relevant citations were sought in recent meta-analyses of LCS research. 6 , 22 23 24 e-Table 1 Record Screening and Selection Retrieved citations were exported to Covidence for de-duplication and screening. Article selection followed 2 independent screening rounds: 2 of the authors (E. E. and C. J.) first screened the titles/abstracts of the retrieved citations and then the full texts of eligible studies. Details of the screening and selection processes are provided in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram, 20 e-Table 2 Quality Assessment Quality of the included studies was assessed across 7 items of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing the quality of nonrandomized studies in meta-analyses. 25 26 27 Data Items Data were extracted relating to the following variables: authors, year of publication, study characteristics (design, sample size, follow-up duration, adherence definition), participants/institutional characteristics, program structure (centralized, decentralized, hybrid), setting (academic, community, mixed), and outcome data (ie, number of participants who received their baseline screening and those who returned for follow-up screening following 10-18 months). Two of the authors (E. E. and C. J.) performed data extraction independently. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus. Statistical Analysis We began by assessing the extent of heterogeneity in the abstracted data, likely due to variations in patients' characteristics, institutional practices around LCS program implementation, study design, program setting, and definitions of adherence. Heterogeneity was assessed by using the Cochran Q test at a 10% significance level ( P I 2 I 2 We pooled adherence proportions from centralized LCS programs studies measuring adherence 10 to 18 months following a negative result on baseline scanning: Proportion adhering to follow-up scan = Number of participants who adhered at follow-up Number of participants screened at baseline Proportions were transformed by using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation to stabilize variances and approximate normal distribution. A meta-analysis was performed by using the inverse-variance weighting method and assigned weights to studies based on the precision of their estimates. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine adherence rates across institution-level (eg, setting type) and participant-level (eg, sex, age, smoking status, race/ethnicity) characteristics. A pairwise meta-analysis was performed by using a random-effects model to examine the association between screening adherence and program structure, comparing differences in adherence proportions for centralized vs decentralized LCS. ORs with 95% CIs are reported. A meta-regression was conducted to examine the relationship between the pooled adherence proportion in centralized LCS and institution- and participant-level characteristics. Mixed-effects meta-regression models were used with the restricted maximum-likelihood estimator to account for both fixed and random effects. The Freeman-Tukey double arcsine-transformed adherence rates were used as the outcome variable to adjust for variability across studies. Effect sizes as changes in the log odds of the transformed adherence rates, with corresponding 95% CIs, are reported. All analyses were conducted by using R version 4.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with relevant packages for meta-analysis (primarily meta and metafor). Due to the limited number of studies, the sensitivity analysis was limited to article type, excluding those available only as conference proceedings from the pooled data. Specifically, we assessed whether data not directly available but estimated from adherence rates and population distributions reported in conference proceedings significantly influenced the meta-analysis results. Publication bias was evaluated with the Egger regression test, followed by a visual inspection of a funnel plot for asymmetry in cases in which the test was significant. Results The meta-analysis included 12 cohort studies (11 full-text manuscripts and 1 conference proceeding) reporting data from 17,195 patients with negative findings on baseline scans. 10 , 12 , 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Figure 1 e-Table 2 Figure 1 The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram for centralized screening programs and lung cancer screening adherence for high-risk individuals with negative baseline.

Many studies attribute the higher adherence rate in centralized programs to several factors, including program dedication to LCS and the integration of programmatic interventions such as navigation supports and program coordinators. 33 The current meta-analysis provides a strong rationale for investing in centralized LCS infrastructure, particularly in underserved areas where nearly 38% of US counties lack adequate access to screening. 17 , 38 39 Overall, adherence to guideline-recommended annual follow-up screenings faces significant challenges from a complex interplay of individual and socioeconomic factors. 24 , 33 , 40 , 41 11 , 13 23 7 Although the current evidence remains limited, the absence of a consistent association between LCS adherence and institution- or participant-level factors in our analysis suggests that centralized programs may help mitigate long-standing barriers to follow-up. Notably, Kim et al 29 6 , 22 , 24 1 As with prior reviews, our findings are based on studies conducted under earlier LCS eligibility guidelines. Recent expansions in eligibility criteria have important implications for adherence patterns, particularly among younger individuals aged 50 to 55 years and those approaching the upper age limit of screening. As participation in LCS grows, further research is needed to evaluate longitudinal adherence trends within centralized programs and to identify factors that influence sustained engagement. This study had several strengths and limitations. A key strength of the current meta-analysis was use of the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation to handle extreme proportions. In addition, the use of a mixed-effects model allowed us to account for known sources of variation, providing more precise estimates for the meta-regression. This meta-analysis has some limitations, including the small number of primary studies and potential publication bias, although the Egger test did not detect significant asymmetry. In addition, significant heterogeneity among the included studies may limit the generalizability of the pooled estimates. Of note, definitions of adherence varied slightly across studies, particularly in the timeframes used to assess annual follow-up, which may have introduced additional variability into our pooled estimate. Interpretation Adherence to annual LCS among individuals with negative findings on baseline scans remains low but is significantly higher in centralized programs than in decentralized ones. Centralization may reduce disparities associated with patient- and institution-level characteristics. Our findings support expanding access to centralized screening infrastructure and implementing targeted quality improvements to enhance guideline-recommended LCS adherence. As LCS eligibility broadens and program participation grows, further research is needed to monitor adherence trends and identify factors influencing sustained engagement in annual screening.
