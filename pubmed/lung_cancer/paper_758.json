Methods For 15 patients, who underwent liver SBRT after trans‐arterial chemoembolization (TACE), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were retrospectively generated on free breathing (FB) and average intensity projection (AVG) CT sets using the x‐ray Voxel Monte Carlo (XVMC) algorithm. The three‐dimensional (3D) FB and AVG plans were compared with corresponding 4D plans, which were created by deformable registration using 10‐phase plans. For both internal target volume (ITV) and planning target volume (PTV), the volume covered by the prescription dose of 36 Gy (V36) and the dose covering 95% of the volume (D95) were evaluated. The relative (3D/4D) normal liver volume >19.2 Gy and rib volume  28.8 Gy were also compared for FB and AVG plans. Results The mean values of the relative electron densities inside the PTV for FB and AVG were slightly different (1.050 for FB vs. 1.039 for AVG). For both ITV and PTV, V36 and D95 showed no statistically significant difference between FB and AVG. Also, the relative rib volumes >28.8 Gy and the normal liver volumes >19.2 Gy were not statistically different between FB and AVG plans. Conclusion For liver SBRT with lipiodol retention, 3D plans based on FB and AVG images were virtually equivalent in producing the 4D cumulative doses under the accuracy of the XVMC algorithm. 4D cumulative dose average intensity projection free breathing lipiodol liver stereotactic body radiotherapy pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  Kang S‐K Yoon J‐W Kim MY Comparison of liver stereotactic body radiotherapy plans based on free breathing and averaged CTs after trans‐arterial chemoembolization using lipiodol J Appl Clin Med Phys 2025 26 e70271 10.1002/acm2.70271 41023542 1 INTRODUCTION Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for liver cancer is commonly practiced after trans‐arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using lipiodol as an embolization agent.  1  2  3  4 Two issues related to lipiodol in liver SBRT need to be noted: dose enhancement by lipiodol and respiratory‐induced variation in the location and density of the tumor containing the lipiodol. Dose enhancement by high‐density materials in radiation treatment has been previously investigated.  5  6  7  6  8 The other problem is the tumor's change in location and density due to respiratory motion, since lipiodol is a high‐density material inside tissue. This situation is similar to a lung tumor moving during breathing within the surrounding lung tissue. Various approaches to lung tumor motion for accurate cumulative dose distribution have been reported.  9  10  11  9  10  11 In this study, based on FB and AVG CT sets with lipiodol retention, we compared 3D VMAT plans with their corresponding cumulative 4D plans to determine which CT set was more reliable for predicting respiration‐compensated cumulative dose in liver SBRT. 2 METHODS Retrospectively, 15 patients who were treated with liver SBRT after TACE were selected based on visual inspection of CT images showing lipiodol retention with contrast similar to that of bone. Patients were immobilized using Elekta BodyFix and CT scanned for conventional three‐dimensional (3D) images as well as 4D CT sets with 10 respiratory phases. The Canon Aquilion CT (Canon Medical Systems, Ohtawara, Japan) and Abches (APEX Medical Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for respiration monitoring were used. After contouring the gross tumor volume (GTV), including lipiodol on the 3D images, an internal target volume (ITV) was generated by adjusting the GTV to compensate for tumor motion on each phase image and was further expanded isotropically by 5 mm to create the planning target volume (PTV) with a setup margin. VMAT plans were created on the FB CT sets using 10 MV of an Elekta VersaHD linear accelerator and the Monaco planning system (version 5.51), with a prescription dose of 36 Gy delivered in four fractions, covering 95% of the PTV. The dose calculation algorithm used was the fast MC method called x‐ray Voxel Monte Carlo (XVMC), and the dose calculation grid was set to 2.0 mm. To assess the 4D cumulative dose, the plan was copied to each phase of the 4D CTs, and doses were recalculated. The doses were accumulated on the FB CT as a reference CT using MIM's deformable registration software (MIM Maestro v7.0, MIM Software Inc., USA), applying equal weighting of one tenth for each phase, assuming that respiratory motion was temporally uniform. In this study, 4D plans refer to the reference CT sets with cumulative dose distributions from all respiratory phase plans. The procedures to create the 3D and 4D plans using the FB images were repeated on the AVG CT images. The AVG image set was generated by averaging the intensities of all phase CTs. After copying all contours for normal organs and PTV from the 3D FB plan to the AVG images with no modifications, the AVG plan was generated through parameter optimization. All dose distributions were also accumulated on the FB images for comparison. During the acquisition of the 4D cumulative dose distribution for each patient, the default registration options were used for both FB and AVG plans to eliminate the influence of potential registration inaccuracies. For both ITV and PTV in the 4D plans, the volume covered with the prescription dose of 36 Gy (V36) and the dose covering 95% of the volume (D95) were evaluated. The ratios of the 3D to 4D volumes for normal liver volume (excluding the PTV) receiving >19.2 Gy and rib volume receiving >28.8 Gy were compared between the FB and AVG plans.  12 p 3 RESULTS Some of the target characteristics and statistical results for 15 patients are listed in Table 1 TABLE 1 Target information and selected evaluation results of 15 patients.

Patients #3 and #6 showed markedly lower values; for the FB image, the electron densities were 0.999 (SD = 0.286) for Patient #3 and 0.922 (SD = 0.31) for Patient #6. For the AVG images, values were 0.894 (SD = 0.341) for Patient #3 and 0.894 (SD = 0.262) for Patient #6. For these two patients, their GTVs were located close to the lung diaphragm.

DVHs for the liver represent the normal liver tissue. As shown in Table 1 For the 4D PTV, D95 and V36 showed no significant differences between FB and AVG plans and were largely patient‐dependent (Figure 4 FIGURE 4 Cumulative 4D analysis for FB and AVG.

A similar analysis was performed for the ribs close to the target to evaluate the probable rib fracture. Five cases among 15 patients (including two cases from Patient #1) showed ribs very close to the treatment target. Rib volumes irradiated with more than 28.8 Gy were obtained for both FB and AVG 3D and 4D plans, and the ratio of 3D to 4D values was evaluated.  12 p 6 FIGURE 6 Relative rib volumes (3D/4D) receiving doses greater than 28.8 Gy. Two cases correspond to Patient #1. 4 DISCUSSION Recently, Kang et al. noted that high‐density lipiodol inside the liver tumor resembles a solid tumor inside lung tissue under breathing motion.  13 The aim of this work was to explore which CT set—FB or AVG—was more reliable to predict the cumulative dose for a moving liver target, specifically when the target contains the high‐density material lipiodol. To this end, 3D plans based on FB and AVG images were compared with their corresponding 4D plans. 4.1 FB versus AVG plans for cumulative dose distribution In our study, the electron density of AVG images was slightly more uniform due to image smearing. This reduced inhomogeneity was expected to cause photon fluences to be less sensitive to variations in each phase image. From lung SBRT plans calculated using XVMC, Zvolanek et al. found no statistical differences between FB and AVG for dosimetric parameters of target coverage and reported that FB and AVG CTs were equivalent for dose calculation.  10 For relative (3D/4D) dose–volume parameters (D95 and V36) of ITV and PTV, FB and AVG plans also showed no statistically significant differences. Hence, in predicting 4D dose and volume metrics for liver SBRT after TACE, FB and AVG plans were considered equivalent. The differences between 3D and 4D values were largely patient‐dependent. The large fractional dose in liver SBRT raises concerns about doses to normal organs. In our study, normal liver volumes receiving a dose greater than 19.2 Gy were evaluated as an indicator of probable radiation‐induced liver disease (RILD).  12 p The 3D‐to‐4D volume ratio of ribs receiving more than 28.8 Gy was also evaluated for five cases. Although the delineated rib volumes were small and deformable registration may include uncertainties, the volume ratio of 3D relative to 4D was highly patient‐dependent and showed no significant difference between FB and AVG plans. In summary, for liver SBRT with the high contrast of lipiodol, FB and AVG images were equivalent for estimating dosimetric quantities—including dose coverage of ITV and PTV, normal liver volumes, and dose to ribs under the accuracy of the XVMC dose calculation algorithm. 4.2 Reduction of the 4D coverage The reduction in 4D dosimetric parameters (V36 and D95) for the PTV was notable. Mean values for FB and AVG plans showed that approximately 98% of the ITV volume was irradiated by the prescribed dose (36 Gy), while 95% of the ITV volume received 37 Gy. In contrast, the PTV coverage was only about 80%, with D95 around 32 Gy. Insufficient 4D coverage of the moving target has been reported by several researchers.  14  15  16  16  15 Intuitively, the reduction in 4D dosimeric parameters is inevitable for moving targets. During the registration process for accumulated 4D doses, the peripheral region outside the target—typically irradiated with much lower doses—could be translated and combined into the PTV in the reference plan. Therefore, the large drop in 4D coverage mainly arises from the target periphery lying on the steep gradient of the prescription dose.  17  18  19  20  21 A practical approach to increase 4D target coverage is to add larger margins to the ITV. However, this increases the volume of normal tissue exposed to high doses, thereby raising RILD risk. For example, Xu et al. reported that while plans based on FB 3D CT showed large reductions in 4D cumulative PTV coverage, plans based on maximum intensity projection (MIP) images maintained nearly the same 4D coverage as 3D. However, normal liver volumes irradiated under MIP were about 1.5 times those in FB plans.  3  17  16 4.3 Dose calculation for lipiodol retention As discussed by Kawakara et al. regarding dose enhancement due to lipiodol, the commercial dose calculation algorithm AcurosXB (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) was not sufficient to predict this enhancement. This limitation was attributed to the lack of proper material information on iodine, a constituent of lipiodol, in the dose calculation algorithm.  8 A similar limitation was applied to XVMC, which is a fast MC engine based on material information specific to the human body.  13  22  8  13  22  13 The lack of material information for lipiodol in the dose calculation algorithm could locally affect the generation of photon fluence to irradiate the PTV in FB and AVG plans. This could, in turn, influence the subsequent 4D evaluation using each phase CT set. Therefore, it should be noted that the equivalence between FB and AVG plans for predicting cumulative 4D doses in this study is valid within the accuracy inherent to the XVMC fast MC dose calculation algorithm. 5 CONCLUSION For liver SBRT planning on CT scans showing lipiodol retention, FB and AVG scans are interchangeable for predicting cumulative 4D dose distribution with respect to target coverage by the prescription dose, normal liver volumes, and rib dose sparing. It should be noted that the XVMC algorithm requires further improvement to accurately calculate doses in regions containing lipiodol by incorporating material‐specific information.
