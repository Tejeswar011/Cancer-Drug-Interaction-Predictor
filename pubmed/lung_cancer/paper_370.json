Bioactive peptides (BP) are digestion-resistant (enzymatically stable) and absorbable fragments that exert physiological functions in the body. We conducted this case-control study to examine the association between dairy-derived BPs and bladder cancer. Methods The present case-control study (103 cases and 200 controls) was a hospital-based investigation conducted in three referral hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 168-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Intake of BPs was estimated based on dairy product consumption recorded in the FFQ. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between the content of digestion-resistant BPs in dairy products and the odds of bladder cancer. Results After adjusting confounding factors, it was observed that the odds of bladder cancer were significantly lower in the second and last tertiles (T) of total peptide intake from dairy products compared to the first tertile (T 2 3 Conclusions The findings suggest a potential inverse relationship between milk-derived BPs and bladder cancer risk, which warrants further investigation in longitudinal or interventional studies. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the biological properties and mechanism of action of milk-derived BPs.

These foods are rich in nutrients and bioactive constituents, which contribute to their significant health benefits [ 8 However, studies have yet to reach a definitive conclusion on this matter. The controversy may stem from the involvement of multiple factors. For example, a meta-analysis found that moderate to high consumption of milk products was associated with a significant reduction in bladder cancer risk, whereas higher intake of whole milk correlated with an increased risk. Likely due to its higher saturated fat content [ 9 Bioactive peptides (BP) are digestion-resistant (enzymatically stable) and absorbable fragments released during the digestion of various food proteins, particularly those from milk products. These peptides perform multiple physiological functions in the body [ 10 11 13 14 In the present study, we aim to determine whether the intake of milk-derived BPs is associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer by closely examining the dietary habits of bladder cancer patients and matched controls. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has addressed this relationship. Therefore, we conducted this case-control study to investigate the potential association between dairy-derived BPs and bladder cancer risk. Methods Study design and sampling This hospital-based case-control study was conducted from December 2018 to March 2020 in three referral hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The sample size was calculated based on a previous study by De Stefani et al., which reported an odds ratio (OR) of 2.35 for adherence to an unhealthy dietary pattern, with a 5% α error and 20% β error [ 15 Exclusion criteria for cases included adherence to a specific diet, a history of other types of cancer, and prior chemotherapy before enrollment. For the control group, individuals with neoplastic diseases related to smoking or those who had undergone long-term dietary modification were excluded. Data were collected through interview with all participants. New diagnosed patients were interviewed during hospitalization, while previously diagnosed patients were interviewed during follow-up visits; the same approach was applied to controls. All cases were histologically confirmed based on tumor tissue samples. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All study procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Iranian Institute of National Nutrition and Food Technology Research, and the protocol adhered to the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration. The research ethics approval code was IR.SBMU.NNFTRI.REC.1398.010. Some details of this study have been published previously [ 16 17 Dietary and non-dietary assessments Trained interviewers administered the questionnaires to participants during their hospital stay. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 168-item FFQ [ 18 Participants’ weight was measured using a digital scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) while wearing light clothing. Height was determined with a non-stretchable tape measure, accurate to 0.5 cm. Checklists were employed to gather lifestyle, clinical, and socio-demographic information, including age, education, marital status, family history of bladder cancer, smoking status, history of chemotherapy, and aciduricemia. Additionally, participants were asked about their use of supplements such as iron, zinc, calcium, and B complex vitamins. Physical activity over the previous seven days was assessed using a validated questionnaire [ 19 Digestion-resistant peptides Dietary intake of BPs was estimated based on dairy food consumption recorded in the FFQ [ 18 20 21 22 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 21.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test assessed the normality of variables. Independent samples t-tests compared mean values between cases and controls, while analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to adjust for energy intake. The Mann-Whitney U test compared non-parametric variables, and the chi-square test analyzed categorical variables. Logistic regression models were employed to examine the association between digestion-resistant BPs from dairy products and bladder cancer risk. The adjusted model controlled for potential confounders, including age, physical activity, BMI, energy intake, fat intake, calcium intake, family history of cancer, gender, smoking status, chemotherapy history, medication use, aciduricemia history, and supplement use.

In recent years, BPs have garnered considerable attention; however, most research has focused on isolated BPs in trial, in vitro, or in vivo settings. For example, Zho et al. engineered an anticancer fusion peptide and transfected it into ovarian cancer cells, inducing apoptosis [ 23 24 25 BPs derived from dairy proteins have demonstrated significant anticancer potential in recent studies. Meisel et al. reported that casein-derived peptides exhibit anticancer activity by inhibiting cancer cell growth and stimulating immunocompetent cells [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Recently, Parastoei et al. developed a novel method to quantify daily intake of dairy-derived BPs for the first time [ 10 33 However, it is important to acknowledge that intake of milk-derived BPs is inherently linked to milk consumption. Dairy products contain other bioactive nutrients such as calcium, protein, vitamin B 2 34 36 37 Limitations This study employs a novel measurement method to advance understanding of dietary BPs and their associations with multiple morbidities. While our approach offers greater time- and cost-efficiency compared to traditional in vitro and in vivo studies, several limitations should be noted. First, dietary data were collected using a validated FFQ, which, despite interviewer administration, may be subject to recall bias and misreporting, particularly regarding portion size and food frequency. This inherent limitation of FFQs should be considered when interpreting the findings. Also, dietary intake was assessed via FFQs, which depend on participants’ memory and honesty, making the data susceptible to recall bias and exposure misclassification. Such misclassification is likely non-differential and could attenuate the observed associations, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation of the results. Second, given the case-control design of the present study, causal inference is limited. Although significant associations between BP intake and bladder cancer risk were observed, the temporal relationship remains unclear, raising the possibility of reverse causality. Prospective cohort studies are needed to establish temporality and confirm the direction of this association. Third, one key limitation of this study is the reliance on an in-silico simulation for estimating peptide intake, which, while innovative, remains an indirect proxy and lacks validation against real-world biological measurements. The model has not yet been compared with actual peptide levels in human samples, such as plasma or urine, following milk consumption. Future research should aim to validate the simulated intake estimations using in vitro digestion models and clinical studies that measure peptide bioavailability in biological fluids. Fourth, the relatively small sample size and use of hospital-based controls may limit the generalizability of our results. Additionally, the observed gender imbalance between groups may have introduced sex-related bias, which should be considered when interpreting the findings. Fifth, despite adjustment for a broad set of dietary and lifestyle covariates, residual confounding remains a potential limitation of our study. Dairy products are complex food matrices containing multiple co-nutrients and bioactive compounds, including calcium, vitamin D, and probiotics, which may independently or synergistically influence bladder cancer risk. Additionally, unmeasured lifestyle factors such as physical activity intensity, sun exposure (affecting vitamin D status), or gut microbiota composition could have influenced the observed associations (Furthermore, other notable limitation of our study is the significant gender imbalance between the case and control groups. Although statistical adjustment for sex was performed, such an imbalance may lead to residual confounding or effect modification that is not fully accounted for). Sixth, subgroup analyses by bladder cancer subtype were not conducted due to limited sample size and incomplete data. Given the distinct pathophysiology and potential dietary risk profiles of subtypes, future studies should address this gap. To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological study to examine the association between indirectly estimated intake of dairy-derived bioactive peptides and bladder cancer risk using FFQ-based dietary data and in-silico digestion models. While innovative, this approach is inferential and requires further validation in future research. Conclusions Our findings indicate an inverse association between milk-derived BPs and colorectal cancer risk; however, due to the observational nature of the study, no causal inferences can be made. Therefore, through the identification of novel compounds derived from dairy products, there is potential to discover complementary drugs for the treatment of malignancies. However, milk-derived BPs are consumed alongside other bioactive components with potential anticancer effects, such as calcium and probiotics. Despite statistical adjustments, disentangling the independent role of BPs from these co-occurring nutrients is difficult and warrants further investigation.
