Introduction Indoor air pollution from cigarette smoke remains a leading yet modifiable risk factor for global morbidity and mortality. Worldwide, 1.30 billion current smokers generate an estimated 209 million kg of PM 2.5 2.5 1 −3 2.5 2 −1 −1 3 Cigarette smoke constitutes a significant source of PM 2.5 4 5 6 7 2.5 Many research has established that MS cigarette smoke poses significant health risks to smokers [ 8 9 10 11 4 SS smoke, emitted from the burning end of cigarettes, contains distinct PM emission characteristics compared to MS smoke [ 12 13 2.5 14 Despite these findings, current research lacks systematic comparative analyses of PM 2.5 2.5 4 + − 3 − 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cigarettes Selected for the Experiment For this investigation, we selected eleven cigarette models representing six distinct brands, encompassing two major cigarette varieties: flue-cured tobacco and popper filter types. Flue-cured (FC) cigarettes are manufactured solely from flue-cured Virginia tobacco dried at 60–70 °C in bulk curing barns. The high reducing-sugar content of this leaf promotes the formation of semi-volatile carbonyls and sugar-dehydration products. Capsule-filter (CF) cigarettes featured a distinctive 3–5 mm breakable capsule embedded in the cellulose-acetate filter containing 10–15 μL of flavoring agents such as menthol or fruit esters. The detailed material parameters of these selected cigarette samples are systematically presented in Table S1 2.2. Collection of PM 2.5 A custom-designed transparent plastic chamber served as the experimental enclosure equipped with operating gloves and was predominantly sealed to maintain a controlled environment. The chamber’s internal dimensions were 0.85 m (length) × 0.75 m (width) × 0.60 m (height), with a volume of 0.3825 m 3 The method and steps for collecting PM 2.5 ® Figure 1 2.5 15 2.5 2.5 The method and steps for collecting PM 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.3. Determination of PM 2.5 2.3.1. Determination of PM 2.5 The mass of PM 2.5 2.3.2. Determination of Carbon Components Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) on the 47 mm quartz-fiber filters were quantified with a DRI-2015 multi-band thermal/optical carbon analyzer (Atmoslytic Inc., Calabasas, CA, USA), operated strictly following the IMPROVE-A temperature protocol. The protocol volatilizes OC in four helium steps (140, 280, 480, and 580 °C) and combusts EC in three oxygen steps (580, 740 and 840 °C); laser transmittance at 633 nm is monitored throughout to correct for charring. OC is reported as the sum of OC1–OC4 plus optically determined pyrolyzed carbon (OPC), whereas EC is calculated as (EC1 + EC2 + EC3) − OPC [ 16 2.3.3. Determination of Water-Soluble Inorganic Ions (WSIIs) A quarter of the loaded sample filter membrane was excised using ceramic scissors and fragmented into a 50 mL sterile centrifuge tube. Subsequently, 30 mL distilled water was introduced, and the centrifuge tube was positioned on a test tube rack before being transported to a KQ-300DE CNC ultrasonic instrument to promote the dissolution of water-soluble ionic substances using ultrasound. After ultrasonic extraction, the aqueous extract was transferred to a clean centrifuge tube using a disposable syringe fitted with a 0.22 µm filter needle, and then stored at −4 °C for analysis.

Percentage Composition of Chemical Components in PM 2.5 Figure 2 2.5 2.5 The particles in MS smoke mainly come from the alternating process of smoldering and burning of the tobacco layer inside the tail burning layer. Among them, the chemical components of PM 2.5 2.5 During MS inhalation, the peripheral region of the cigarette tip undergoes luminous, oxygen-rich combustion with a high temperature (about 800–900 °C), while the interior experiences oxygen-limited smoldering pyrolysis.

Distribution of Ratios of OC/EC The OC/EC ratio of particulate matter from combustion sources shows significant source dependence and can serve as an effective indicator for distinguishing different fuel types. Research indicates that the OC/EC ratio for fossil fuel combustion (coal, oil, natural gas) is typically low (<0.4), with coal combustion having the lowest ratio (0.1–0.3), reflecting its high combustion efficiency and EC dominance [ 33 34 35 36 Table 1 2.5 2.5 37 The OC/EC ratio in PM 2.5 16 The OC/EC ratio reflects combustion completeness, with higher ratios indicating greater proportions of oxygenated organic carbon (OC) species. Previous experimental studies [ 45 46 2.5 2.5 3.2. Emission Factors (EFs) of PM 2.5 3.2.1. Emission Factors of PM 2.5 Figure 6 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 These variations stem from combustion dynamics: SS smoke undergoes oxygen-limited free combustion (400–600 °C), releasing coarse particles laden with carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals (e.g., As, Cd). In contrast, MS smoke experiences brief high-temperature combustion (800–900 °C) during puffing, generating ultrafine particles (<1 μm) that deeply penetrate alveoli, carrying nicotine, formaldehyde, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 47 Previous study indicates that coarse particles in smoke may be effectively intercepted when passing through a filter. However, fine and ultrafine particles present a greater challenge for filtration due to their small size and high diffusivity, which allows them to easily pass through the filter’s pores and enter the smoker’s respiratory tract [ 48 49 50 2.5 29 51 52 3.2.2. Emission Factors of Carbon Components Figure 7 2.5 The significant variability in organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) emission factors (EFs) between mainstream (MS) and sidestream (SS) smoke ( Figure 7 53 54 Notably, the EC emissions showed an inverse pattern, with SS smoke demonstrating slightly higher average EC levels (0.06 μg/g) than MS smoke (0.05 μg/g). While absolute EC concentrations were relatively low, the presence of EC in both smoke types is concerning due to its role as a carrier for toxic compounds and its potential to induce oxidative stress in lung tissues. The detection limit challenges for EC in some samples (e.g., JS5 in MS smoke) may reflect analytical limitations rather than absence of this toxic component [ 55 56 These findings highlight the differential exposure risks between active and passive smokers. The higher OC burden in MS smoke suggests greater direct toxicity for smokers, while the relatively higher EC content in SS smoke may contribute to the well-documented health risks of secondhand smoke exposure. 3.2.3.

Emission Factors of Elements Figure 9 2.5 60 61 62 63 20 64 65 2.5 4 Cu, Zn, Cd, As, and Ni are recognized contributors to the oxidative potential of PM 2.5 66 24 67 Because SS smoke dominates secondhand exposure, the higher EFs of toxic metals in this fraction translate directly into greater indoor concentrations of carcinogenic and cardiopulmonary-active species. Effective mitigation requires strict source control (complete smoking bans) and, where bans are not feasible, high-efficiency ventilation or air-cleaning technologies targeting both particulate and gaseous phases. 4. Conclusions This study provides quantitative emission profiles of SS smoke, establishing its significance as an indoor source of toxic PM 2.5 4 + − 3 − MS smoke generally exhibits higher emission factors for organic carbon (OC) and certain metals, while SS smoke demonstrates elevated levels of elemental carbon (EC) and a broader range of toxic elements and WSIIs. The distinct combustion characteristics of MS and SS smoke, driven by differences in oxygen availability and temperature, result in varying particle sizes and chemical compositions. MS smoke generates ultrafine particles that penetrate deeply into the lungs, carrying neurotoxic and carcinogenic compounds, whereas SS smoke releases coarser particles laden with carcinogens and elements that persist in indoor environments as thirdhand smoke. The higher emission factors of toxic elements and WSIIs in SS smoke underscore the disproportionate health risks posed to non-smokers through secondhand exposure. Despite these insights, our study has limitations, including the absence of formal exposure or risk assessments to contextualize the disproportionate toxicity of cigarette aerosols. Future research should (i) expand comparative analyses to electronic and heated-tobacco products, (ii) integrate emission factors with real-world inhalation scenarios to quantify personal exposure doses, and (iii) investigate the toxicological role of enriched Zn, As, and NH 4 + Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/toxics13090711/s1 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 68 69 70 71 72 73 Author Contributions Y.Z.: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Validation, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing.
