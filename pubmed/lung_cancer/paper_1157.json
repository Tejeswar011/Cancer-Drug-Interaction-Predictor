Introduction Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a major epithelial malignancy of the head and neck, ranking as the sixth leading malignant tumor worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Inspired by the therapeutic efficacy of natural products, many investigations focused on the therapeutic potential of various secondary metabolites present in plants and found that flavonoids exhibit excellent antitumor activities [ 15 16 17 18 19 Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Our group has previously developed wogonin–aloperine co-amorphous (Wog-Alop) drug delivery systems and significantly improved the bioavailability of wogonin [ 28 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Reagents and Materials Wogonin (Wog) and aloperine (Alop) were bought from Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) with purity greater than 98%. Chromatographic grade methanol, acetonitrile, and formic acid solvents were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Ltd. (Waltham, MA, USA). Physiological sodium chloride solution was bought from Kelun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). Primary antibodies and HRP-labeled anti-goat and anti-rabbit second antibodies were purchased from Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). 2.2. Animals The six-week-old BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) weighing 20 ± 2 g, and were randomly divided into cages (6 rats per cage) and acclimatized for at least one week with free access to food and water. The experimental protocols were in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals of National Clinical Research Center for cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College (NCC2023A237). 2.3. In Vivo Anti-OSCC Efficacy of Wog–Alop After acclimatizing to laboratory conditions for one week, the BALB/c nude mice were surgically implanted with tumor tissue 1 mm in diameter from OSCC patients to create PDX model. As the tumor volume exceeds 100 mm 3 n 2 29 2.4. Network Pharmacology The potential targets of wogonin were predicted by Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP, https://old.tcmsp-e.com/tcmsp.php 30 http://swisstargetprediction.ch/ 31 https://prediction.charite.de/ 32 https://lilab-ecust.cn/pharmmapper/index.html 33 https://www.genecards.org/ 34 https://www.omim.org/ https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/ https://cn.string-db.org/ https://www.metascape.org 2.5. Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulations The molecular docking was performed with Discovery Studio 4.5 software (access occurred on 25 June 2024). The structure of Wog–Alop was drawn by KingDraw (access occurred on 22 June 2024), and then the crystal structures of P53, Bax, Caspase3, and Bcl-2 proteins were obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB) database ( https://www.rcsb.org/ 35 2.6. Western Blots Analysis Fresh tumor tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in a homogenization tube after washing with pre-cooled PBS. Lysis buffer with protease inhibitor was added, and homogenization was carried out, centrifuging to collect the supernatant. Subsequently, the cells were collected and incubated with ice-cold lysis buffer for 30 min on ice before being centrifuged at 4 °C at 12,000 r/min for 5 min. The lysate protein (10 μg) was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and electrophoretically separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing with TBST, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with HRP at room temperature for 30 min. The blots were examined using a AIWBwellTM (Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China). The relative expression of proteins was quantified using highly sensitive ECL western blotting substrate. 2.7. Immunohistochemistry Staining Firstly, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections were dewaxed with xylene and then hydrated in anhydrous ethanol. Subsequently, antigen retrieval was conducted by immersing the sections in pH 9.0 EDTA with medium heat for 8 min by microwave, followed by blocking endogenous peroxidase with 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide for 25 min. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Washing with PBS, the sections were probed with the desired secondary antibody for 50 min. Finally, the sections were staining by diamino-benzidine staining solution for visualization at room temperature. The antibodies are listed in Table S1 2.8. TUNEL Staining Briefly, the dewaxing tumor tissue sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 5 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity, and then repaired with proteinase K, followed by incubating with permeabilization wash solution (0.1% triton) for 5 min at room temperature. After covering with a buffer for equilibrium for 10 min, the tissue sections were then treated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzymes, dUTP and buffer with a ratio of 1:5:50 and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the tissue sections were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min while adding DAPI dyeing fluid and incubated for 10 min. Finally, the tissue sections were placed in PBS (pH 7.4) for decolorization and sealed with anti-fluorescent quenching seal. The tissue sections were checked with a NIKON ECLIPSE C1 microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and the images were collected using a NIKON DS-U3(Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). 2.9. Statistical Analysis The data were statistically compared using GraphPad Prism 9.5 (access occurred on 5 May 2025). The values were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and the statistically significant difference between groups was evaluated by a two-way ANOVA test. The significance of difference is indicated when * p p 3. Results 3.1. In Vivo Anti-OSCC Efficacy of Wog–Alop The inhibition of tumor growth by Wog–Alop on OSCC in vivo was investigated by a PDX model. As shown in Figure 1 Figure S1 3.2. Network Pharmacology A total of 284 potential targets for Wog–Alop were predicted by the TCMSP, Swiss, Super Pred, and Pharm Mapper databases; meanwhile, 834 disease targets for OSCC were collected by Genecards and OMIM databases. After that, 49 intersected targets were obtained by intersecting the Wog–Alop potential targets with OSCC disease targets through Draw Venn Diagram ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 The above intersected targets were subjected to GO and KEGG analysis ( p Figure 2 Figure 2 3.3. Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulations While pathway enrichment analysis revealed stronger alterations in PI3K-AKT, ROS, and VEGF signaling, therapeutic target selection must additionally consider factors including druggability, selectivity, and clinical translatability. Extensive research demonstrates that PI3K-AKT inhibition induces apoptosis through Bax activation and Bcl-2 downregulation, ROS accumulation triggers mitochondrial apoptosis via Bcl-2 family disruption, and VEGF blockade removes survival signals that maintain the Bcl-2/Bax balance. Therefore, apoptosis-related targets P53, Caspase3, Bax and Bcl-2 were selected as validation targets because they represent the convergence point where these multiple pathways execute their anticancer effects, offering superior druggability and established clinical relevance. Structural selection criteria prioritized templates with co-crystallized ligands in druggable pockets relevant to our mechanistic hypothesis, minimal crystallographic artifacts, and established structure–activity relationships. All co-crystallized ligands and cofactors were retained during initial docking to preserve native binding site conformations, then removed for production runs to avoid steric bias. According to the prediction results ( Figure 3 Figure S2 Figure S3 36 Table 1 Furthermore, the stability of the protein-ligand complexes formed by Wog–Alop with Bcl-2 and Bax were further explored by molecular dynamics simulations. RMSD and RMSF are important parameters in molecular dynamics, which are commonly used to describe the conformational changes in proteins or molecular ligands as well as the range and intensity of motion of each atom in the protein structure. As shown in Figure 4 Figure S4 Figure S5 3.4. Wog–Alop Induced the Apoptosis of Tumor Cells The apoptosis of tumor cells can be used to determine in part the effect of anticancer drugs, which is regulated by the Bcl-2 family. Specifically, pro-apoptotic Bax promotes the cytosolic release of cytochrome C and activates one of the key executioners of apoptosis, Caspase-3, leading to apoptosis, while the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 indicates the release of apoptosis suppression in tumor cells [ 37 Figure 5 Figure 5 Notably, it could be seen that among the apoptosis-related targets (P53, Caspase3, Bax and Bcl-2), Wog–Alop treatment significantly enhanced the pro-apoptotic protein Bax compared to Wog monotherapy ( p 38 39 40 To further validate the apoptotic effects, immunohistochemical analysis was performed ( Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 6 3.5. Evaluation of Multiple Organ Toxicological of Wog–Alop The histologic sections stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) were performed to evaluate the toxicity of Wog, Alop and Wog–Alop. As shown in Figure 7 Figure S6 4. Discussion OSCC is a major epithelial malignancy of the head and neck [ 41 Natural products demonstrate synergistic enhancement effects in combination therapies and achieve reduction in severe adverse events compared to conventional chemotherapy, which makes them highly efficacious in the treatment of cancer. The present study established Wog–Alop as a promising natural therapeutic candidate for OSCC through systematic validation using PDX model. Compared to existing natural products and traditional chemotherapy agents, Wog–Alop demonstrates clear advantages in multi-target regulation, safety, and potential combination therapy applications. For instance, curcumin primarily functions through the NF-κB signaling pathway [ 42 43 44 45 5. Conclusions In conclusion, the significant inhibition of Wog–Alop against OSCC was validated by a PDX model, which simultaneously orchestrates Bcl-2/Bax ratio modulation, P53 activation, and Caspase3 cascade initiation. Compared to existing natural products and conventional chemotherapeutics, Wog–Alop demonstrates advantages in multi-target regulation, safety, and potential combination therapy applications. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting natural product-based drug development and provide a paradigm for systematic evaluation of novel anticancer agents.
