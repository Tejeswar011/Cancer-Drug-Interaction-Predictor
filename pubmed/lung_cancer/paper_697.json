The whole plants of Dicliptera chinensis Results The dried powders of the whole DC plants are extracted with 95% ethanol to get DC-95EE. The DC-95EE is partitioned in sequences to get ethyl acetate fraction, butanol fraction (BuOH fraction), and water faction. Two flavone C-glycosides (vicenin II and schaftoside) are purified from the BuOH fraction. It is found that the pre-treatments of DC-95EE, BuOH fraction, and vicenin II and schaftoside show to elevate cell viabilities, reduce the senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SAβG) activity and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in galactose-treated SH-SY5Y neuronal cell models. The pre-treatments of vicenin II or schaftoside also show to lower ageing-associated p16 and p21 gene expressions and enhance SIRT-1 gene expressions in galactose-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The DC-95EE, vicenin II, and schaftoside show dose-dependent anti-acetylcholinesterase activities. The oral administrations of DC-95EE (200 mg/kg) and purified schaftoside (25 and 50 mg/kg) daily for 7 days ameliorate cognitive declines in scopolamine-induced ICR mice evaluated by Morris water maze. The quantification of vicenin II and schaftoside, respectively, account for 2.53% and 8.17% of DC-95EE by HPLC quantifications, which may be active compounds in the DC-95EE for anti-ageing activities. Conclusion The DC-95EE exhibit anti-ageing in neuron cell models and attenuate cognitive declines in mice models, which may be potentials in developing functional foods for anti-ageing purposes and need further investigations.

The aged person older than 60-year-old in 2019 globally is one billion, and is estimated to increase to 1.4 and 2.1 billion by 2030 and 2050, respectively (World Health Organization 2025 2025 2020 2025 2010 2011 2016 2014a b Vitis thunbergii taiwaniana Trapa taiwanesis 2014 2023 2021 2022 2009 2009 2012 2021 2022 2023 2021 2022 2022 The Dicliptera chinensis 2010 Dicliptera 2002 p D. riparia 2006 O d O d O 2007a b 2012 2012 2017 2016 O d O l d 2018 Penicillium notatum 2021 Methods Materials The recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (rhAChE) was purchased from R&D Systems Inc.

The Aβ 1-42 d d l 1 13 d 6 1 13 Preparations of crude extracts and partitioned fractions The DC whole plants were purchased from a local herbal store in April 2019. The voucher specimens were kept in the Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy, Taipei Medical University for references. The DC whole plants were air-dried at open space for 1-week, ground mechanically to fine powders, and then were extracted by soaking in 95% ethanol (W/V = 1:4) at room temperature (27 °C) for 24 h. After being filtered, the residues were repeated for another four times at the same procedure. Each 95% ethanol extracts were collected, combined and concentrated by a vacuum concentrator, and lyophilized to get DC-95EE (140.2 g) for further experiments. For preparations of DC-95EE partitioned fraction (fr.), the DC-95EE (132.7 g) was weighted and suspended in distilled water and then partitioned in sequence by n n Isolation and purification from the butanol fractions of DC-95EE The BuOH fraction of DC-95EE was weighted (19.3 g), dissolved in distilled water, and loaded onto a Diaion HP-20 column (70 cm × 3 cm), chromatographed and eluted by batch types of solvents in sequences of distilled water, 20% increases from 20% methanol to 100% methanol, and 70% acetone to obtain 7 fractions of DCB 1-1 to DCB 1-7. The fraction DCB 1-4 was weighted (1.39 g) dissolved in distilled water, and loaded onto a Sephadex LH column (45 cm × 2 cm), chromatographed and eluted by batch types of solvents in sequences of distilled water, 10% increases from 10% methanol to 100% methanol to get DCB 1-4-1 (collection of tube 1-21), DCB 1-4-2 (collection of tube 22–70), and DCB 1-4-3 (collection of tube 71-109). The sub-fraction DCB 1-4-1 was re-chromatographed with Toyoperal HW-40(F) column (45 cm × 2 cm) and eluted by batch types of solvents in sequences of distilled water, 10% increases from 10% methanol to 100% methanol to get DCB 1-4-1-1 (collection of tube 1-6), DCB 1-4-1-2 (collection of tube 41-90), and DCB 1-4-1-3 (collection of tube 91-101). The sub-fraction DCB 1-4-1-1 was re-chromatographed with Biosil Aqu-ODS-W-5u column (70.4 mm × 14.5 mm) and eluted with 10% methanol to get DCB 1-4-1-1-1 fraction. The DCB 1-4-1-1-1 fraction was further purified by semi-preparative HPLC using a Waters Atlantis T3 semi-preparative column (5 μm, 10 mm i.d. × 250 mm) eluted with 38% methanol, 2 mL/min, to get DCB1-4–1-1-1-1 fraction.
