We assessed the association between individual SEP (education and occupation) and air pollution in the Turin and Varese European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohorts.

Introduction Clean air is essential for healthy living; however, in most parts of the world air is contaminated with many pollutants that adversely affect human health [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2.5 2 8 Given the importance of this issue, it is crucial to investigate whether the pollutants’ distribution is uniform in the population or if distinct levels of exposure characterise different socioeconomic groups. Notably, the unequal distribution of most risk factors in the population [ 9 10 11 12 In this context, this study aims to assess the relationship between two individual indicators of socioeconomic position (SEP) (education and occupational levels) and a selection of air pollutants (NOx, NO 2 10 2.5 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. The Study Design, Data Sources, and Study Population The data came from the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a multicentre European study in which more than half a million volunteers of both sexes and aged between 35 and 74 years at recruitment were recruited in 10 European countries between 1993 and 1998 [ 13 14 15 Air pollution data came from the European Study Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), an investigation into the long-term effects of exposure to air pollution on human health in Europe, which included 36 European areas (among others, a sub-sample of the EPIC Turin and the whole EPIC Varese) in which air pollution was measured and Land Use Regression models were developed to assign the annual mean concentration at the address of cohort members (declared at enrolment and transformed into geographical coordinates) [ 16 2.2. Variables of Interest 2.2.1. Outcomes The outcome of interest is the level of a selection of pollutants, whose measurement unit is µg/m 3 (1) Nitrogen oxides (NOx); (2) Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 Two additional pollutants were considered for the Turin cohort only: (3) Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM 2.5 (4) Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM 10 All considered pollutants have been classified by the International Agency Against Cancer (IARC) in Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans) [ 17 18 2 2.5 10 19 20 21 22 23 24 2 10 2.5 2.2.2. Exposure and Confounding Variables The primary exposure variable is the level of education, which has been used as the main indicator of individual SEP because it is considered to be a valid proxy for social position since it reflects life experiences during childhood and work opportunities in adulthood [ 25 The variable was categorised into three groups: Low-level education (those who achieved at most a lower secondary school certificate); Medium-level education (at most a higher secondary school certificate); High-level education (more than a higher secondary school certificate). The educational level variable was then transformed into the relative index of inequality (RII) [ 26 27 The RII was derived by associating each participant’s education level with the midpoint of the cumulative proportion of individuals sharing that same educational attainment within a specific category (sex, age, and cohort). This procedure was iterated for every education level within each distinct category. The resultant value assigned to each participant ranged from 0 (indicating minimal disadvantage, i.e., high education) to 1 (denoting substantial disadvantage, i.e., low education), effectively characterising their social standing relative to their counterparts within the designated category (sex, age, or cohort). These computed values were subsequently utilised to harmonise data from diverse categories. Numerically ordering these values offers insight into the relative social positioning of each participant, disentangled from the influences of age, sex, and cohort [ 27 For the purpose of this work, the overall distribution was then grouped in tertiles, and an RII score (high, middle, or low) was assigned to each participant based on the tertile comprising their RII value. This assignment corresponds to their position within the distribution: high for the first tertile, middle for the second tertile, and low for the third tertile. Importantly, this process can lead to individuals with differing education levels being grouped into the same RII tertile, accounting for the effect of sex, age, and cohort differences in terms of educational attainment. The secondary exposure variable is the occupational level. As an individual indicator of SEP, the occupational level not only mirrors the education achieved to obtain that job and the income it provides, but also has its own role in determining the social status defined by one’s occupation [ 28 29 30 Low-skilled employment (skill level 1): unskilled and skilled workers (ESCO categories 7, 8, and 9); Medium-skilled employment (skill level 2): farmers, retailers, and clerical workers (ESCO categories 4, 5, and 6); High-skilled employment (skill levels 3–4): professionals and managers (ESCO categories 1, 2, and 3). For study participants still of a working age, the job at the time of enrolment was used, while for the retired ones, the last job before retirement was considered. Unemployed people and housewives were excluded from the analysis. Adjustment variables included sex (male or female), marital status (married or not married), and age classified into 10-year classes (35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and ≥65). 2.3. Statistical Analysis 2.3.1. Descriptive Analyses For continuous variables (pollutants), the mean, standard deviation, and median were computed. For categorical variables (RII tertiles, occupational level, age, sex, and marital status), absolute and relative frequencies were calculated. T 2.3.2. Models After verifying the distribution’s normality with the skewness and kurtosis tests for normality [ 31 32 33 First, univariable linear regression models were run to evaluate the association between each pollutant and the main exposures (education and occupation level) and the confounding variables (age, sex, and marital status). Secondly, for each pollutant, multivariable linear models adjusted for age, sex, and marital status were fitted for each exposure variable (education and occupation level). The modifying effects of the cohort were tested in the fully adjusted models using a Wald test of hypotheses; given the presence of interaction, results were reported for the two cohorts separately. Analyses were performed using Stata version 18, developed by StataCorp LLC (College Station, TX, USA) and released in 2023. 3. Results The cohort comprised 19,842 subjects, 55.9% from the Varese cohort and 44.1% from the Turin cohort. The mean age of the pooled cohort was 50.5 years (51.1 years for Varese and 49.8 years for Turin). Males represented 36.6% of the pooled cohort, with substantial variation between the two cohorts: they were 21.4% of the total in the Varese cohort and the 55.8% of the total in the Turin one. The distribution of the RII tertiles of educational level was similar in the two cohorts, with the lower level of education always being the most common level (38.4% and 34.7% for Varese and Turin, respectively). The distribution of occupation differed between the two cohorts: more than half of the subjects in the Varese cohort (51.5%) had low-skilled employment, whereas more than half of the Turin one (59.0%) had medium-skilled employment. On the contrary, marital status had an almost identical distribution, with 86.8% and 86.1% of people married in Varese and Turin, respectively ( Table 1 The mean levels of nitrogen molecules (NO 2 p 2 3 3 3 3 3 10 2.5 Table 2 There was a clear relationship between educational level and occupation ( p Table A1 Appendix A p p p Similarly to what was described for the educational level, in both cohorts, older age groups were more likely to be employed in low-skilled sectors, and young age groups in medium-skilled jobs ( p Table A2 Appendix A p p p Considering the two nitrogen molecules, the association between the exposures and the outcomes has similar patterns within each cohort, with the more deprived exposed to slightly lower levels of air pollution ( Table 3 In the Varese cohort, the univariate analysis showed that the mean exposure to NO 2 2 2 Figure 1 2 2 In the Turin cohort, the univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the mean NO 2 2 The analysis of the association between the SEP and mean levels of particulate matters in the Turin cohort revealed that it was very weak to null ( Table 4 10 2.5 10 2.5 Figure 2 4. Discussion This study aimed to investigate the relationship between individual socioeconomic position, measured through educational or occupational level, and exposure to air pollution (NO 2 10 2.5 As reported in a recent systematic review, the evidence on social inequalities in exposure to air pollution in Europe is mixed with an inconsistent pattern of association [ 12 34 35 36 37 38 39 39 39 39 40 41 42 43 11 44 17 17 This hypothesis is useful in explaining the results of our study. Indeed, both in Turin (see Figure A1 Appendix A 45 Although this spatial pattern could not be formally quantified within the scope of our study, previous research on the socioeconomic geography of Turin has shown that the majority of central neighbourhoods are inhabited by highly educated and affluent populations (see Figure A1 Appendix A 2 Despite these exceptions, our results and interpretation are consistent with those described in the Turin children of the NINFEA cohort (an Italian web-based multi-purpose mother–child cohort based on questionnaires): even in this case, where SEP at childbirth was measured through the Equivalised Household Income Indicator, low–medium SEP children were less likely to be exposed to air pollution than the higher-SEP ones [ 46 To lend support to the hypothesis that social geography and urban mobility interact in defining the relationship between SEP and exposure to air pollution, we collected information about major sources of air pollution and protective measures in the cities for which evidence on the relationship under study was available ( Table 5 In the interpretation of the results of our study, in light of the current evidence, it is also important to mention that the relationship between SEP and exposure to air pollution could also change with respect to the use of different SEP indicators or the consideration of different city areas. For example, in Rome, the direction of the relationship has been demonstrated to reveal an opposite gradient (resulting in less affluent and less educated people being exposed to higher air pollution) if only the inner city centre is considered [ 42 47 48 49 12 Although the relationship between SEP and exposure to air pollution can show a pattern of reduced exposure among the socioeconomically disadvantaged strata of the population, other factors need to be taken into account when assessing the ultimate impact of air pollution on health. Indeed, besides the differences in exposure, the differences in susceptibility and vulnerability to air pollution play a crucial role in influencing health outcomes [ 12 50 37 51 52 53 Therefore, considering this, policies aiming at reducing air pollution must look at health equity since the results could be counterintuitive. For example, in Paris, different scenarios of extension of the low-emission zone contributed to increased inequalities in preventable deaths and in new cases of three major chronic diseases [ 54 55 56 57 Limitations and Strengths This study suffered from a limitation because, despite being analysed as a cross-sectional study, air pollution level measurements were conducted in a period that was more than ten years later than the date of recruitment of the two cohorts: indeed, recruitment took place between 1993 and 1998, but measurements were conducted in the 2008–2010 and 2009–2011 periods. To consider them valid measures, two hypotheses should be true: that in those years, the reduction in air pollution occurred at the same rate in all parts of the city, and that in those years, recruited people remained at the same address. Both hypotheses could be considered valid: the first one, because neither in Turin nor in Varese has any specific policy to reduce air pollution in precise areas been implemented, and the second one, because recruited individuals were aged more than 35 years at enrolment, so they probably had already started a family, which may reduce the likelihood of further movement. Another limitation of this study is its conclusions’ generalisation to the present: indeed, in the years between study recruitment and air pollution measurements, people with a higher SEP owned more powerful and more polluting cars, accounting for higher transport-related emissions [ 58 59 60 61 57 62 Moreover, as for most environmental studies, air pollution has been estimated at the residential addresses of the individuals in the cohort. This limitation was, in reality, a double one, since it considered only outdoor air pollution (but people spend the majority of their time indoors), and since people spent a lot of time in places other than home (for example, at work or at school). However, this limitation has been demonstrated to exerts little to no influence on the estimation of air pollution exposures in papers investigating this phenomenon [ 63 64 Another limitation of this study was the way air pollutants were estimated: indeed, the developed LUR models were based only on 20 measurement sites for particulate matter and on 40 measurement sites for nitrogen molecules. Even if a strict rule for a minimum number of sites does not exist, a higher number of sites allows for a reduction in the risk of overfitting [ 23 23 20 23 Additionally, the cohort of Turin was composed of residents in high-population-density areas, the highest of which was the municipality of Turin itself, with a value of 6709.9 people per km 2 65 2 66 67 Another limitation of this study was that participants in the EPIC study volunteered, which may introduce biases if the selection process was associated with both SEP and air pollution. Indeed, people with a higher socioeconomic status are generally more likely to participate in such studies [ 68 However, the voluntary enrolment allowed us to gather individual socio-demographic data, which is the main strength of this study. Indeed, two different SEP indicators were used, and the fact that the conclusions are rather similar gives strength to our findings. Moreover, it also allowed us to estimate air pollution exposure at the address of each cohort member. Through this level of granularity, we achieved remarkable precision in our measurements, strengthening the reliability and accuracy of our data. The final strength of this study lay in the high numerosity of its sample: the nearly 20,000 people considered enhanced the study’s statistical power, increasing the likelihood of detecting even minimal differences between groups. 5. Conclusions In the Turin and Varese EPIC cohorts, a decade after enrolment, individuals with lower educational attainment and those with low-skilled occupations experienced slightly reduced exposure to nitrogen molecules compared to their counterparts in high-skilled jobs and with higher education levels. Conversely, there was a minimal, non-significant distinction between these two groups’ exposure to particulate matter in Turin. These findings, which reflect data from almost twenty years ago, still contribute to the progress in understanding the complex association between socioeconomic status and air pollution and should be analysed in conjunction with more recent studies, as well as studies on the effects of this exposure on populations’ health. Indeed, both exposure and susceptibility play an important role. Thus, even an exposure pattern in favour of the most deprived could conceal health consequences that favour the least deprived. Adopting this multifaceted approach will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between air pollution and socioeconomic position, revealing any associated health implications.
