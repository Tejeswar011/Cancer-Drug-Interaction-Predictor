Although diagnosis in the classical form is easily realized, there are atypical presentations that can be challenging, particularly in the absence of diagnostic means. Case presentation We report the case of a 28-year-old single African woman who had been experiencing prolonged fever and diffuse inflammatory joint pain for months, and who had manifested odynophagia and a fleeting, salmon-pink skin rash in her upper limbs, in whom, after thorough evaluation, the diagnosis of adult-onset-Still’s disease was made. This was based on the various symptoms presented by the patient, a positive acute phase reactant with elevation of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and high serum ferritin with a low percentage of glycosylated ferritin (< 20%), an absence autoimmunity markers and comorbidities, and confirmed by both Fautrel and Yamaguchi diagnostic criteria, within the month following admission after excluding all differential diagnoses. Conclusion Adult-onset-Still’s disease is a rare pathology considered as a diagnosis of exclusion, which should be considered in the face of any fever of unknown origin. It is present in young adults over 16 years old, with an average peak at diagnosis of 38–39 years old and a sex ratio of 2:1 (female:male), with a female predominance of the disease. Rapid diagnosis and appropriate management with steroids, biologics and immunosuppressants are the keys to a favorable prognosis for this condition.

She was treated for malaria with a 3-day course of oral artesimin combined therapy (artemether-lumefantrine 80/480 mg twice daily), and received a short antibiotherapy course with 1000 mg of ciprofloxacine daily for 10 days, and 1000 mg of amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanic acid twice a day for 10 days without improvement. The persistence of the symptoms led her at our consultation. Her past medical history was unremarkable, and she had no known previous immune deficiency. She did not have any chronic disease nor known allergies. On physical examination, the patient’s general condition was classified as stage 2 according to the WHO performance index, with fever, pallor, large, painless hepatomegaly, and Hackett 2 splenomegaly. Mobile cervical lymph nodes and axillary adenopathy, crackles at the base of the lungs were also found symmetrically and bilaterally. Given the local epidemiological context, the respiratory, lymph node, and spleen involvement, a suspicion of multifocal tuberculosis was made. Antituberculous treatment was initiated. Additional laboratory tests were negative for anti-double stranded DNA antibodies, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies, and rheumatoid factors. However, a biological inflammatory work-up revealed a C-reactive protein of 184.96 mg/L (normal value < 6 mg/L), a sedimentation rate of 110 mm at the first hour, and a procalcitonin of 1.52 ng/L (normal value < 0.005). A moderate hypochromic microcytic anemia (8.2 g/dL, normal value 12–16) was observed in the blood count, with a leucocyte count of 8,000/mm 3 1 Figure 1 Chest computed tomography showing bilateral lung infiltration ( A B On the 20th day of hospitalization for the management of multifocal tuberculosis and the 16th day of treatment with four-drug antituberculosis therapy and symptomatic treatment, the patient presented with persistent clinical manifestations with the appearance of odynophagia, confusion and hypersialorrhea. The hemodynamic parameters were normal, and the clinical and biological parameters of the inflammatory syndrome were stable. This led us to suggest an adverse reaction to antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid in particular) rather than possible septic shock. A brain CT scan was performed and was normal (Fig. 2 3 Figure 2 Brain computed tomography showing no anomalies ( A B Figure 3 Evanescent Salmon rash on the arm (right) Discussion We report the case of a patient with clinical and paraclinical manifestations of AOSD. This is a rare auto-inflammatory disease defined in 1970 by Bywaters. Its clinical manifestations are diverse and varied, involving a set of described and approved diagnostic criteria; Yamaguchi (Table 1 2 10 Table 1 Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD (1992)[ 16 Major criteria Minor criteria Exclusion criteria Fever of at least 39 °C, intermittent lasting 1 week or longer Sore throat Infections Arthralgias or arthritis lasting 2 weeks or longer Recent development of lymphadenopathy Malignancies Typical rash Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly Leucocytosis (≥ 10,000/mm 3 Abnormal liver function Other rheumatic diseases Negative tests for ANA or RF Diagnosis requires five or more criteria, two of which must be major PMN ANA RF Table 2 Fautrel criteria for AOSD (2002)[ 16 Major criteria Diagnosis requires four major criteria or three major criteria and two minor criteria Spiking fever ≥ 39 °c Arthralgias Transient erythematous rash Sore throat PMN ≥ 80% Glycosylated ferritin ≤ 20% Minor criteria Maculopapular rash Leucocytosis ≥ 10,000/mm 3 Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis were excluded because immunological markers were negative. An alternative diagnosis would be haematological malignancy (particularly lymphoma with possible haemophagocytosis), due to the presence of adenopathy, splenomegaly, cytopenias and cytolysis [ 18 19 More specifically, while lung involvement is fairly rare in AOSD, mainly represented by pleurisy, fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), interstitial involvement is even rarer [ 20 20 21 The long-delayed diagnosis was previously mentioned by Singwe Ngandeu et al. al. 22 23 The immunopathogenic mechanism of the disease is uncertain. It lies at the crossroads between an inflammatory syndrome and a lymphohistiocytic activation syndrome. Hyperactivation of macrophages and neutrophils, combined with low activation of natural killer cells in innate immunity, and low activation of regulatory T cells in acquired or adaptive immunity, contribute to the pathogenic process of AOSD. The result is an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, interleukins 1 beta (IL-1β,) 6 and 18, and Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF α), creating a storm of cytokines which, in a vicious cycle, will in turn cause macrophage activation [ 5 10 24 Severe complications are associated with this disease: macrophage activation syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic microangiopathy, fulminant hepatitis, cardiac complications such as pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade, myocarditis and endocarditis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, pleurisy, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary emphysema and amyloidosis [ 25 For a long time, its treatment was empirical, despite numerous advances and the advent of biotherapies in its management. The first-line drug class remains corticosteroid therapy (initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day), with methotrexate added as a second-line treatment, widely used for its steroid-sparing effect. The refractory form of AOSD is managed using inhibitors of IL-1β (Anakinra in the lead) and interleukin 6, depending on whether we are dealing with systemic or chronic joint manifestations, respectively, as well as antagonists of TNF α. The latter has been shown to improve prognosis [ 17 24 Conclusion AOSD remains a rare condition, the diagnosis of which is still challenging owing to the diversity of its clinical manifestations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where means of diagnosis are lacking and the disease is poorly known. Here, we presented a case of AOSD with lymphadenopathy and chest lesions at the forehead but without leucocytosis. The absence of diagnosis means and the nonclassical presentation misdiagnoses the case as tuberculosis or cancer. Improvement of diagnosis means and biological therapies are necessary to improve diagnosis and disease control.
