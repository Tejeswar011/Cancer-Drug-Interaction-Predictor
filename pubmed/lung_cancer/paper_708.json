Effectively delivering radiation to CR targets requires understanding and accounting for geometric uncertainties. One important uncertainty is motion induced by the cardiac and respiratory cycles, which can be accounted for by expanding the targeted region by a margin accounting for the motion's effect on dosimetry. Purpose To investigate margins to account for cardiac and respiratory motions in CR and compare different methods of computing these margins. Methods Eighty four hundred cardiorespiratory motion traces were created by joining 1050 cardiac motions derived from 30 Hz magnetic resonance images with eight respiratory motions from 5 Hz bi‐planar kV fluoroscopy. Cardiac motions for each of the 17 segments of the left ventricle were acquired for 50 heart failure patients with a reduced ejection fraction. Respiratory motions were derived from the implantable cardioverter defibrillator lead's tip for eight CR patients. The margins needed to account for random errors were found using the convolution method by blurring a dose penumbra (Gaussian fall‐off σ p β ( σ − σ p ) Results The sum of cardiac and respiratory motion amplitudes significantly overestimated the motion margins by [2.2±0.7 right‐left, 2.6±0.9 ant‐post, 2.7±0.7 inf‐sup] mm. The margin formula accurately calculated the motion margins with average differences from the convolution method of [0.00±0.06, 0.0±0.1, 0.0±0.1] mm. Accounting for the amplitude of respiratory motion alone was on average sufficient but not robust, as it could underestimate the motion margin by up to 5 mm. Conclusions Margins to account for cardiorespiratory motion in CR can be calculated using a margin formula. The conservative approach of accounting for the amplitude of cardiorespiratory motion can significantly overestimate the needed margin which may result in excess healthy tissue damage. arrhythmia cardiac motion cardiac radioablation cardiac SBRT cardiorespiratory motion margins respiratory motion stereotactic arrhythmia radio‐ablation stereotactic body radiotherapy ventricular tachycardia Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute 10.13039/501100008002 Providence Health Care Research Institute 10.13039/501100023558 BC Cancer Foundation 10.13039/501100015803 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  Marshall J Poon J Bergman A Margins to account for cardiac and respiratory motion in cardiac radioablation Med Phys 2025 52 e70041 10.1002/mp.70041 41024249 1 INTRODUCTION Cardiac radioablation (CR) is an emerging treatment for ventricular tachycardia (VT)—a rapid, abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to cardiac arrest. CR targets the VT substrate in the left ventricle with a single 25 Gy dose of radiation. Clinical evidence is beginning to accumulate, with several studies describing treatment of 10 or more patients.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 The efficacy of radiation therapy treatment relies on the ability to precisely locate and subsequently deliver radiation to the diseased area of myocardium. Geometric uncertainties in radiation therapy can compromise this effectiveness, resulting from discrepancies between the planned and delivered dose distributions. Two classifications of geometric uncertainties exist, based on the uncertainties’ influence on the cumulative dose.  8  9  10  11 CR is distinguished by cardiac and respiratory‐induced motions which present a challenge to geometric targeting of cardiac lesions. Several studies have noted the importance of motion in CR by quantifying cardiac and/or respiratory induced motions.  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  21  22  22  23 The simplest way to account for geometric uncertainties in radiation therapy is to use a safety margin that extends the targeted volume to ensure the diseased volume receives the intended radiation dose. Specifically, margins extend the clinical target volume to form the planning target volume (PTV), a volume defined so there is a clinically acceptable probability that the CTV receives the prescribed dose despite geometric uncertainties.  24  25  26 M P T V Σ σ  9 (1) M PTV = α Σ + β σ − σ p α σ p α = 2.5 β = 1.64  25  26  27  28  29  30 2 METHODS Margins to account for 8400 realistic cardiorespiratory motions are assessed. The motion margins are calculated using the convolution method, which simulates the blurring of the dose penumbra. These margins are treated as the ground truth and are compared to three alternative methods for margin creation: (i) linear addition of cardiac and respiratory motion amplitudes, similar to an internal target volume (ITV) approach; (ii) the van Herk et al. margin formula  9 2.1 Convolution method Random errors accounting for cardiac and/or respiratory motions were calculated using the convolution method.  10 1 C(  x R(  x  x 1 CR(  x )) CR(  x ) = C(  x ∗ R(  x D ( x ) (2) D blurred = D x ∗ CR x D p r e s c S ( x , w ) G ( x , σ p ) (3) D x = D p r e s c S x , w ∗ G x , σ p 2 (4) S x , w = 1 x ≤ w 0 x > w (5) G x , σ p = exp − x 2 2 σ p 2 x σ p σ p w  9 1 1 24 FIGURE 1 Example calculation of (top row) cardiac, (middle) respiratory, and (bottom) cardio‐respiratory margins. Motion traces are used to create cardiac and respiratory position probability distributions and convolved to create the cardiorespiratory position probability distribution. Each position distribution is blurred with a dose penumbra, with the margin found as the shift between the blurred and original penumbras at the 95% dose level. 2.2 Margins based on an internal target volume A conservative approximation of the margin needed to account for motion during radiation therapy is to use an internal target volume (ITV). An ITV is defined to encompass all positions of the target through the motion cycle(s) but does not consider the impact of motion on dosimetry. The maximal extent of motion in the presence of cardiac and respiratory motions is equal to the sum of their amplitudes ( A c + A r ) A c ) ( A r ) p ≤ 2.3 Margin formula Assuming a Gaussian distribution of errors, van Herk et al. derived a margin formula ( MF  9 (6) MF = β σ − σ p σ σ p β β = 1.64  9 σ c ) σ r ) σ p ) (7) σ = σ c 2 + σ r 2 + σ p 2 Together, Equations ( 6 7 MC 2.4 Respiratory motion compensation alone The impact of neglecting cardiac motion in defining margins to account for motion induced random errors is investigated. Accounting for the amplitude of respiratory motion alone is investigated by calculating the difference between the amplitude of respiratory motion and the cardiorespiratory motion margins calculated with convolution ( A r − MC 2.5 Cardiac and respiratory motion Cardiac and respiratory motion were acquired from separate patient data and combined to create realistic cardiorespiratory motion traces as illustrated in Figure 2 NCT02052804 FIGURE 2 8400 cardiorespiratory motions are generated by combining 1050 cardiac motions with eight respiratory motions. Cardiac motion of 50 heart failure patients (18 female) with reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF<40%) underwent 1.5 T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. This population group was chosen as VT predominantly occurs in patients with reduced cardiac function.  2  4  31  32  33  19  33  34  35  36  37  33 Respiratory motion of eight patients was acquired during a motion simulation in preparation for CR treatment. Patients were imaged using 5 Hz bi‐planar kV fluoroscopy equipped on the Vero4DRT linear accelerator (Brainlab AG, Munich, Germany). Sagittal and coronal fluoroscopy images were acquired simultaneously for 15–20 s (∼3‐5 breaths) with patient breathing restricted by an adjustable and inflatable compression belt (Radiation Products Design Inc, Albertville, MN). All patients had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) from previous intervention with a cardiac lead implanted in the right ventricle. The position of the ICD lead tip was tracked in each orthogonal image using normalized cross correlation image template matching. The tracked position of the ICD lead was verified and manually adjusted, if needed. Finally, the lead's tip was triangulated using the orthogonal views before extracting the respiratory component of the motion using a lowpass filter.  38  13  14  20  39  39 3 RESULTS 3.1 Margins based on an internal target volume The margins needed to account for respiratory, cardiac, and cardiorespiratory motions are shown in Figure 3 3a 3b 3c A c + r p FIGURE 3 Margins calculated to account for random errors as a function of the motion amplitude due to (a) respiratory, (b) cardiac, and (c) combined cardiorespiratory motion. 3.2 Margin formula Since linear addition of motion amplitudes overestimates dosimetric cardiorespiratory margins, the utility of a margin formula (Equation 6 4 FIGURE 4 Margins calculated to account for random errors due to (a) respiratory, (b) cardiac, and (c) combined cardio‐respiratory motion as a function of the standard deviations in motion. Also shown is the theoretical curve (black dotted line) predicted by the margin formula 1.64(σ‐ σ p The accuracy of using the margin formula is quantified by the margin error defined as the margins predicted using the formula subtract the expected value from the convolution method.

Data is binned by respiratory motion patient with the (left‐half‐violin/right‐half‐violins) showing the errors in the (a) right/left, (b) anterior/posterior, and (c) inferior/superior directions. Errors in applying the margin formula are further explored in Figure 6 FIGURE 6 Differences between the margin formula (MF) and the margin calculated with convolution (MC) for each cardiac segment in the (left violin/right violin) (a) right/left, (b) ant/post, and (c) inf/sup directions. Differences are shown after removing the outlier breath in patient 4. 3.3 Respiratory motion ITV alone The impact of accounting for the amplitude of respiratory motion alone was investigated. Figure 7 FIGURE 7 Differences between accounting for the amplitude of respiratory motion ( A r e s p 4 DISCUSSION Margins to account for cardiac and respiratory motions in cardiac radioablation were explored. The margin to account for 8400 cardiorespiratory motion traces were found to be significantly less than the amplitude of cardiorespiratory motion. On average, the motion margins were smaller than the cardiorespiratory amplitude by [2.2±0.7 right/left, 2.6±0.9 ant/post, 2.7±0.7 inf/sup] mm after removing an abnormal deep breath from the analysis. The van Herk et al. margin formula  9 Random errors blur the dose distribution which was performed by convolving a dose profile with cardiac, respiratory, and cardiorespiratory position probability distributions. The random error margin was that needed for the clinical target volume (CTV) to receive at least 95% of the prescription dose.  9 6  9 5 6 Previous work has explored creating ITVs for VT patients using cardiac and respiratory 4D computed tomography (CT) images.  27  29  30  21  22 Accounting for respiratory motion alone was investigated to assess the use of an ITV defined from a respiratory correlated 4DCT which has been employed in clinical studies.  3  7  40  41  42 The motion estimation approach used in this work produces high temporal resolution cardiac and respiratory motions. Other imaging techniques, that only acquire motion data for a single breath, may be less indicative of the overall patient cardiorespiratory motions during treatment. Failure to capture representative cardiorespiratory motions during the motion assessment will hinder the accuracy of the derived dosimetric margins. The deep breath of patient 4 in this study brings cognizance to the importance of variability in patient breathing. Although margins may be created based on a sample of target motion during imaging, they are inaccurate if not indicative of breathing during treatment. Variability in cardiorespiratory motion should also be considered in the motion estimation approach which is used to characterize cardiorespiratory motions. Here, respiratory motion was acquired for 15–20 s, allowing for the respiratory position probability distribution to characterize ∼3‐5 patient breaths. While margins to account for random errors in CR are presented, it is critical to also consider systematic errors, which result in a shifting of the cumulative dose. Such sources of errors include target delineation, localization, and other consistent errors resulting in a displacement of the dose distribution. For CR, delivered in a single fraction (without patient repositioning), set‐up errors also become systematic. This is contrary to fractionated treatments, where set‐up errors are in part random, due to repeated patient set‐up. Furthermore, derivation of the random errors assumes delineation of the target in its time average position. Clinically, this may be implemented similar to the mid‐position approach  29  43  44  45 1  9  46 This work considered a series of 1D motions and further work should investigate the extension of this work to volumetric targets while also considering rotations and deformations. If margins derived here are applied equally throughout a volumetric target, they represent a lower limit of the margin to account for cardiorespiratory motion. This is due to different regions within the target having different motions due to rotations and shape deformations. Generally, cardiorespiratory motions will lead to rotations and deformations, which should be carefully considered in translating this work to the clinic. One hypothetical solution is to apply the margin formula locally to all points in the CTV, defining a margin to encompass the resultant shift in the 95% isodose. While this work analyzed numerous cardiorespiratory motion traces, it should be verified that the motion characteristics of arrhythmic VT targets are similar. However, acquiring high resolution motion for an extended duration is challenging, and limited cardiorespiratory data has been presented.  15  47  48  49 Clinical implementation of the cardiorespiratory motion margins requires thought to the assumptions in their derivation. First, the CTV is assumed to be large compared to the random errors. Witte et al. demonstrated that the margins need to increase for smaller CTVs.  50  30  51 σ p = 3.2 Supplemental Materials σ p = 6.4  43  50  50 β = 1.64 β = 0.84  9 β  52 Supplemental Materials 5 CONCLUSION Margins to account for random errors due to intrafraction motion in cardiac radioablation (CR) should be defined using both cardiac and respiratory motions. Defining a margin equal to the amplitude of cardiorespiratory motion, similar to using an internal target volume, overestimates the impact of motions on dosimetry. Cardiorespiratory motion margins can be calculated using the van Herk et al. margin formula using the standard deviation of cardiorespiratory motion. The derived dosimetric margins do not consider rotations and shape deformations and are considered a lower limit to account for cardiorespiratory motions.
