Despite its morphological similarity to lung small cell carcinomas, its oncogenesis remains uncertain. One hundred and seventy-one EP-SCNC were enrolled in a multicenter study, and all tissue samples underwent an immunohistochemical p53 analysis. One hundred twenty-five samples were molecularly analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS), comprising DNA and RNA analysis. p53 normal/wild type expression was detected in 68 cases (39.8%), whereas aberrant expression was detected in 103 cases (60.2%).

There are four types of p53 immunoexpression – (1) normal (wild type) expression and (2) abnormal (aberrant, mutation-type) expression, where p53 can be either (2a) overexpressed, (2b) completely absent, or (2c) expressed in the cytoplasm of the cell. In wild-type p53 immunoexpression, variable nuclear expression, either weak or strong, is detected in less than 75% of tumor cells. p53 overexpression means strong nuclear positivity in at least 80% of the tumor cells. In completely negative tumors (with positive internal control staining), the p53 immunostaining is aberrant, i.e., completely absent. In general, in-frame mutations lead to p53 overexpression. Disruption of genes (truncation, splice site mutations, deletions, frameshifts) is associated with the null type p53 immunophenotype [ 1 4 5 Mutations in the TP53 6 The type of genetic alteration further defines p53 functionality [ 2 TP53 TP53 Many advances in our understanding of TP53 Extrapulmonary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (EP-SCNC) is a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis [ 7 7 8 TP53 9 This study aimed to complete an immunohistochemical p53 and molecular TP53 TP53 Materials and methods Sample selection The original study included 171 samples of diagnosed EP-SCNC over 24 years (from 1999 to 2023). Small cell carcinomas with a neuroendocrine morphology (high-grade tumors consisting of tumor cells with scant cytoplasm, finely granular chromatin without nucleoli, brisque mitotic activity, frequent apoptotic bodies, and necroses) but without known pulmonary involvement were included, regardless of expression of neuroendocrine markers although expression of three standard markers (i.e., INSM1, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A) was analyzed in all samples. Other types of tumors were carefully excluded using immunohistochemistry at the time of diagnosis. The study was multicentered, with specimens from the archives of all participating pathology departments. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from biopsies or surgical resection were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were reviewed by two pathologists (R.M. and K.P.). Representative areas were selected from the FFPE blocks, and tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed. Other representative parts of tumors were selected for next-generation sequencing (NGS); the percentage of vital cells was estimated semi-quantitatively. Clinical data included sex, age at diagnosis, and primary origin of the tumor. Overall survival (OS), i.e., the time between the initial diagnosis and death, came from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic. The study was performed with the approval of the Committee for Ethics in Science, Czech Academy of Science. Immunohistochemical analysis IHC was performed on TMAs using four μm thick sections of FFPE tissue. For the construction of the TMAs, eligible areas of each tumor were identified, and two tissue cores (each 2.0 mm in diameter) were taken from the donor block using the tissue microarray instrument TMA Master (3DHISTECH Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). Using TMAs, IHC was performed for p53, using the DO-7 antibody (DakoCytomation, mouse, dilution 1:70). In discordant cases (IHC aberrant staining and non-mutated TP53 TP53 p53 immunohistochemical expression was scored as wildtype, aberrant–null expression, aberrant with cytoplasmic expression, or aberrant–overexpressed, i.e., in cases where more than 75% of the tumor cells displayed strong nuclear positivity (described in detail elsewhere) [ 4 In ambiguous cases, both pathologists (R.M. and K.P.) re-evaluated the slides together to reach a consensus. Molecular analysis of TP53 mutation status DNA for NGS was isolated from FFPE tissue sections using Quick-DNA/RNA FFPE Miniprep Kits (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. NGS libraries were prepared using KAPA Hyper Plus kits (Roche) and HyperCapture (Roche) targeted custom panels (786 genes or gene parts; 2440 kbp of the target sequence; 1992 kbp of coding sequence), which included coding sequences for all TP53 10 11 12 In our study, if the tumor content in the FFPE specimen was < 40%, a microdissection was performed to augment tumor cell proportions. At the same time, in combined tumors, tissue microdissection was used to obtain only the small cell carcinoma constituent. Statistical analysis All analyses were performed using R version 4.4.1 and RStudio; survival analyses were carried out using the survival package 3.7), survminer 0.4.9 and adjustedCurves 0.11.2 [ 13 14 For OS analysis, a Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) calculated using the log–log method and the p-value from the log-rank test. Univariate and age-adjusted Cox regressions were also performed for each parameter and expressed as unadjusted and age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI. For OS analysis, patients were censored at five years. The Pearson chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate to assess associations between categorized variables. For p53 and TP53 Cohen´s kappa, sensitivity, and specificity of immunohistochemical analysis and molecular analysis were calculated with regard to the TP53 P Results Clinical data Of the 171 patients included in the analysis, there were 103 males (60.6%) and 67 females (39.4%), with a mean age of 67 years (range 38.2–94.1 yrs.) at the time of diagnosis. Median survival was 9.36 months (95% CI 7; 12.3 months), five-year survival was 22%. All patients were of Caucasian origin. The primary EP-SCNC tumor location was the genitourinary tract in 81 patients (47.4%), gastrointestinal tract in 28 patients (16.4%), gynecological tract in 20 patients (11.7%), pancreas in nine patients (5.3%), head and neck in eight patients (4.7%), breast in six patients (3.5%), hepatobiliary system in six patients (3.5%), and the skin in one patient (0.6%). There were 12 EP-SCNC with an unknown primary site (7%) – in these tumors, as well as in all selected cases, a primary pulmonary origin was carefully and completely excluded. All specimens were from tumor resections/biopsies of primary tumors, apart from the 12 EP-SCNCs with an unknown primary site. There were 98 biopsies and 73 resection specimens. One hundred and forty-seven tumors (86%) were pure SCNC, whereas 24 tumors (14%) were combined with SCNC. Combined SCNC included acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate and urothelial carcinoma, mixed colorectal adenocarcinoma, mixed ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Two patients were lost to follow-up for survival and expression analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis P53 IHC was performed in 171 patients. Among them, p53 normal/wild type expression was detected in 68 cases (39.8%), overexpression was detected in 62 cases (36.3%), a complete absence of p53 staining was detected in 37 cases (21.6%), p53 cytoplasmic expression in one case (0.6%), and p53 overexpression with cytoplasmic expression at the same time was detected in three tumors (1.8%). There was no difference in the proportion of wild-type/aberrant p53 expression relative to tumor locations ( p There was no difference in p53 expression in combined versus pure EP-SCNC ( p INSM1, synaptophysin, or chromogranin A immunoexpression was detected in 144 tumors (85.2%); 25 tumors were negative for all three markers. Neuroendocrine marker expression did not differ in tumors with wild-type or abnormal p53 expression (HR = 0.56, 95%CI 0.19, 1.52, p Molecular analysis Molecular TP53 NM_000546.5 NM_000546.5 NM_000546.5 Complete NGS data are provided in Pavlickova et al. [ 15 Forty-eight tumors had missense mutations, 23 tumors had truncational mutations, nine tumors had truncational mutations and missense mutations at the same time, five tumors had missense mutations and deletions at the same time, two tumors had missense mutations on both alleles, two tumors had truncational mutations on both alleles, and one tumor probably had a heterozygous TP53 Immunohistochemical and molecular biological results correlation Both immunohistochemical and molecular analysis was performed on 125 tumors. Among them, p53 normal/wild-type expression was detected in 44 cases (35.2%). In contrast, complete absence was found in 20 cases (16%), p53 overexpression was detected in 57 cases (45.6%), pure cytoplasmic expression was detected in one tumor (0.8%), and p53 overexpression with cytoplasmic expression at the same time was detected in three tumors (2.4%). Concerning associations between immunohistochemical and molecular analysis, p53 aberrant expression was tightly associated with a TP53 p TP53 Among tumors with paired IHC and molecular results, 108 exhibited concordance between IHC and molecular analysis, whereas 17 were discordant. In discordant cases, molecular analysis revealed no alteration in three tumors with p53 overexpression (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 A TP53 B TP53 NM_000546.5 C TP53 NM_000546.5 D TP53 NM_000546.5 On the other hand, in 14 tumors with wild-type p53 expression (31.8%), TP53 1 Details for the tumors with discordant molecular analysis and protein expression analysis are illustrated in Table 1 Table 1 Summary of p53 and TP53 Sex Age Location p53 IHC status Type of mutation detected by NGS TP53 Death Combined female 74 GI tract Wild type expression M; D NM_000546.5 1 0 female 67 Genitourinary Wild type expression M NM_000546.5 1 0 male 73 Genitourinary Wild type expression M NM_000546.5 1 1 female 86 Haed and neck Wild type expression M NM_000546.5 1 0 male 70 Genitourinary Wild type expression T NM_000546.5 1 0 male 66 Unknown primary Wild type expression M NM_000546.5 1 0 male 70 Genitourinary Wild type expression M NM_000546.5 1 0 male 69 Genitourinary Wild type expression T; M NM_000546.5 NM_000546.5 0 0 male 65 Unknown primary Wild type expression D 0 0 male 67 GI tract Wild type expression M NM_000546.5 1 0 male 83 Haed and neck Wild type expression M NM_000546.5 1 0 male 78 Genitourinary Wild type expression T NM_000546.5 1 1 male 61 Genitourinary Wild type expression T; M NM_000546.5 NM_000546.5 1 0 male 74 Genitourinary Wild type expression T; M NM_000546.5 NM_000546.5 0 0 male 68 GI tract Over-expression no mutation detected 1 0 female 38 Gynaecological Over-expression no mutation detected 0 0 female 45 Gynaecological Over-expression no mutation detected 0 0 M T VUS H CNV Survival analysis Median survival of the whole group was 9.4 months (95% CI 7.0; 12.3), and five-year survival was 22.5% (95% CI 12.0; 24.0%).

Discussion TP53 TP53 16 TP53 17 18 TP53 9 19 TP53 There was a strong association between p53 immunoexpression and TP53 TP53 Even though SCLC and EP-SCNC are histologically and immunohistochemically identical tumors, they differ in tumorigenesis. Moreover, with our increasing knowledge of targeted therapy, targetable genetic alteration should be carefully sought in patients with EP-SCNC. Currently, platinum-based chemotherapy is used to treat EP-SCNC as a standard treatment protocol. On progression, there is no consensus on second-line therapy [ 20 21 TP53 22 Concerning the types of TP53 TP53 6 TP53 Regarding p53/ TP53 TP53 23 24 IHC results can be modified or even blurred by preanalytical factors (e.g., poor tissue fixation). Due to the clonal heterogeneity of the tumor, TMA may complicate the analysis. In all discordant cases, we repeated IHC using the whole FFPE sample; however, the result of IHC was the same as in TMA. Additionally, correct interpretation of p53 IHC is essential. Both pathologists (R.M. and K.P.) re-evaluated the slides together to reach a consensus in uncertain cases. Despite this, we identified 14 “false positive” NGS results in cases with normal p53 expression, suggesting that tumor heterogeneity can play a significant role. Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is well known for having a high mutation rate [ 15 25 TP53 24 NGS results can also be affected by tissue quality and processing, e.g., small amounts of tissue as well as samples containing fragmented DNA, a necrotic tumor, or high non-tumor content [ 26 27 TP53 Nevertheless, discordant results (NGS TP53 TP53 TP53 28 29 15 30 Due to the improvement of our understanding of oncogenesis, the interpretation of NGS results can differ over time. In our study, two “variants of unknown significance” were referred after description of aberrant p53 immunoexpression. Although our observations in these cases cannot change the current classification of detected variants, they may serve as a basis for warranting a more thorough functional analysis of these variants. Short follow-up in some patients (diagnosed between 1999–2023) may represent limitation in the statistical analysis. Conclusion To our knowledge, ours is the first p53 immunoexpression / TP53 mutation study in a large cohort of neuroendocrine tumors with various primary locations .
