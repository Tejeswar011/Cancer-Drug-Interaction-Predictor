Methods Data were collected from 87 patients who underwent delta large-channel endoscopy between January 2022 and June 2023 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University. Skeletal muscle index at the L3 level SMI < 36 cm 2 2 2 2 Results There were no significant differences in gender, age, BMI, intraoperative bleeding, operative time, hospitalization time, and complication occurrence between the two groups ( P P P P Conclusion Functional recovery after delta large-channel endoscopic decompression was better in non-sarcopenia patients than in the sarcopenia group, and sarcopenia had a greater impact on long-term postoperative outcomes in older patients. We need to emphasize the diagnosis and intervention of sarcopenia in patients to reduce the impact of sarcopenia on postoperative clinical outcomes. Whether sarcopenia affects the stability of lumbar spine in endoscopic patients requires a longer follow-up period and later studies.

The causes of its development are related to nutritional deficiencies, lack of exercise, malignant tumors, and endocrine-related diseases, in addition to aging [ 1 2 3 4 5 Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common disease causes low back pain in elderly patients, and its prevalence is as high as 19.4% over 60 years of age [ 6 30 Method Eighty-seven patients with lumbar spinal stenosis admitted to the First Hospital Affiliated to Ningbo University from January 2022 to June 2023 were collected, including 47 males and 40 females, aged 60–85 years old(Ethical Approval Number : No. 036RS, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University). Inclusion criteria: (1) confirmed diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis, patients with typical symptoms of intermittent claudication with low back and leg pain, excluding other causes of intermittent claudication (spinal cord-derived intermittent claudication, vascular-derived intermittent claudication); (2) preoperative lumbar spine CT, lumbar spine MRI, and other images were consistent with the diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis; (3) history of the disease was more than 3 months and ineffective with conservative treatment; and (4) the patients underwent delta large-channel endoscopic Surgery. Exclusion criteria: (1) the existence of lumbar spine slippage or lumbar spine instability; (2) a history of lumbar spine surgery; (3) imaging shows lumbar spine infections, tuberculosis, tumors and other diseases; (4) serious internal medicine-related diseases. There are no clear diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Currently, more studies usually use L3 level skeletal muscle index SMI < 36 cm 2 2 2 2 7 8 2 2 1 Fig. 1 Cross-sectional CT images of the inferior aspect of L3 to calculate the skeletal muscle index  Fig. 2 Delta large channel endoscopic working channel and dilatation tube Operation procedure After general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on the spinal frame, and the responsible segment was confirmed and marked by fluoroscopy with the “C” arm machine. Routinely disinfect and spread the towel, make a 10-mm incision in the midline 10 mm from the marked segment, insert a dilatation tube to reach the intervertebral space, confirm the correct segment under fluoroscopy with the “C” arm machine, and then dilate the segment step by step and place a surgical working cannula. A delta large-channel endoscopic system was connected (Figs. 2 3  Fig. 3 Operating instruments Postoperatively, the patient routinely rests for 12–24 h and then wears a waist cuff to go down to the ground. Outcome evaluation (1) Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, JOA scores, Oswestry dysfunction index (ODI) scores, and MacNab score [ 31 Statistical methods SPSS22.0 software was used for statistical analysis, in which the measurement data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, independent sample t-test was used for comparison between the two groups, and paired t-test was used for comparison within the group. The χ2 test was used for count data. p Results Clinical outcomes A total of 87 patients were included in this study, of which 41 patients were in the sarcopenia group and 47 patients were in the non-sarcopenia group. There was no statistically significant difference in gender, age and BMI between the two groups ( p 1  Table 1 Comparison of baseline between two groups Sarcopenia Non-sarcopenia P Number 41 47 – Age 69.05 ± 6.67 68.70 ± 6.77 0.81 gender (male: femal) 18: 23 29: 17 0.07 BMI (kg/㎡) 24.92 ± 2.87 23.87 ± 2.69 0.08 BMD −2.54 ± 0.61 −1.80 ± 0.44 < 0.05 Segment 0.27 L2-3 2 2 – L3-4 4 2 – L4-5 30 29 – L5-S1 5 13 – φ: p Both groups of patients successfully completed the surgery.

Wang WF et al. found that sarcopenia is an independent risk factor for osteoporotic vertebral compression re-fracture [ 15 16 17 34 35 18 The effect of sarcopenia on patients with lumbar spinal stenosis after delta large-channel endoscopic treatment Sarcopenia not only plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of the disease, but is also strongly associated with the prognosis after disease treatment [ 19 20 3 21 22 23 24 25 P 20 26 This study found that sarcopenia has a negative impact on patients’ postoperative clinical outcomes, while it has been suggested that muscle mass loss is common after a period of inactivity or reduced mobility, and that only 3 days of bed rest can result in > 1 kg of muscle mass loss in elderly patients [ 27 28 29 In conclusion, functional recovery after delta large-channel endoscopic decompression was better in patients without sarcopenia than in those with sarcopenia, and sarcopenia had a greater impact on long-term postoperative outcomes in elderly patients. We need to emphasize the diagnosis and intervention of sarcopenia in patients to reduce the impact of sarcopenia on postoperative clinical outcomes. Liu et al. demonstrated that sarcopenia and osteoporosis might mutually have a significant causal effect on each other [ 32 33 Limitations This study has some limitations. First, as this was a retrospective single-center study prone to bias, all eligible patients were identified using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to minimize bias. Secondly, there is a lack of uniform criteria at home and abroad regarding the diagnosis of sarcopenia, and this study was based on the diagnostic criteria recommended by the EWGSOP, but did not include measurements related to skeletal muscle function.
