SUMMARY Stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major therapeutic challenge because it is not easy to decide whether patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or not. This study was designed as a retrospective prognostic study combining standard histopathologic parameters with tumor budding and microsatellite instability. The study included 89 patients on elective treatment for stage II primary colorectal adenocarcinoma from January 2011 to December 2015. Study results indicated that the prognosis of patients with stage II CRC depended on the combination of three factors, (in the order of importance): number of lymph nodes examined; total number of buds per a priori Keywords: Colorectal cancer Stage II Tumor budding Lymph nodes Prognosis pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide1. Staging of the CRC describes the extent of cancer and how far it has spread. Consequently, it is an essential information for rational therapy planning ( 1 2 2 2 Adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum stage II, according to the extent of the tumor (T), extent of spread to the lymph nodes (N), and presence of metastasis (M) (TNM) staging by the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC), are not such a heterogeneous group (pT3/4, pN0, pM0) compared to other stages. There still is a large difference in 5-year survival among stage II subgroups IIA, IIB and IIC compared with stage IIIA. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEERS) data, the 5-year survival of stage II patients varies from 66% in stage IIA to 37% in stage IIC, which is significantly less than stage IIIA in which lymph nodes are positive, and 5-year survival is 73.1% ( 3 There are many studies trying to identify high-risk stage II patients using different prognostic factors. Some of the factors identified are morphological features such as pT4, grade 3 tumors, fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined by pathologists, and lymphovascular/perineural invasion ( 1 6 6 9 Several studies have shown that the number of lymph nodes collected has an important impact on survival due to a more accurate stage and better determination of the prognosis ( 10 11 Sometimes after surgery, either due to the patient anatomic characteristics, inappropriate surgical technique, or a smaller number of lymph nodes collected by the pathologist, we do not have a minimum of 12 lymph nodes examined, which can lead to incorrect determination of pN stage, which can affect the choice of therapy and ultimately survival ( 12 Tumor budding can be defined as the finding of a single tumor cell or a small group of up to five cells separated from the invasive front of the tumor ( 13 13 15 16 Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is the finding of cancer cells within endothelium-lined lymphatic or venous structures ( 17 18 Carcinoembryonic antigen is a glycoprotein mainly secreted by solid tumors. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends CEA as a tumor marker for colon cancer ( 19 20 21 Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a concept of phenotypic expression observed in patients with sporadic CRC, as well as in patients with Lynch syndrome ( 22 22 23 24 25 The aim of our study was construction of a simple prognostic algorithm for identification of high-risk stage II CRC patients who could benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Only a few studies have focused on tumor budding and number of lymph nodes harvested. The study was designed as a retrospective prognostic study combining classic demographic and histopathologic parameters with three methods of tumor budding, MSI, and CEA levels. The data obtained were analyzed by recursive partitioning, a survival analysis method based on machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence ( 26 27 26 27 Patients and Methods Patient selection The study included 89 patients. They were selected from the archive of the Department of Pathology of our hospital and represent patients treated for stage II primary colorectal adenocarcinoma in the period from January 2011 to December 2015. Patients were excluded in case of emergency surgery, present inflammatory bowel disease, Lynch syndrome, and missing survival data. Clinical data were obtained from the hospital database system. Slide selection and staining All postoperative materials were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The examination was performed using a 5-mm-thick longitudinal cuts of postoperative material. All slices were embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). HE slides were reviewed by two pathologists experienced in gastrointestinal pathology. Budding counting Tumor budding ( Fig. 1 28 per 2 15 29 et al 29 per 2 per 2 per 2 Fig. 1 Presence of tumor budding (hematoxylin-eosin staining, X200). Histopathologic staging Histologic type, histologic grade, intravascular and perineural invasion, pT and pN were determined using The American Joint Committee of Cancer (8th Edition) criteria for pathologic staging of resected material ( 1 Carcinoembryonic antigen Carcinoembryonic antigen is a polysaccharide-protein complex often used as a biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis8. CEA (ng/mL) was determined in patient serum using Human CEA ELISA kit by Novateinbio ( https://novateinbio.com/human-elisakits/76297-human-cea-elisa-kit.html Microsatellite stability/instability The material is cut into preparations at standard thickness of 4 µm and stained with an immuno-histochemical method, performed on a fully automated device Ventana BenchMark ULTRA platform at the Clinical Department of Pathology and Cytology, Dubrava University Hospital, Zagreb. Microsatellite instability was determined using the following antibodies (MMR IHC panel, Ventana, Roche): MLH1 (MutL Protein Homolog 1, mouse monoclonal antibody), clone M1; MSH2 (MutS Protein Homolog 2, mouse monoclonal antibody), clone G219-1129; MSH6 (MutS Protein Homolog 6, rabbit monoclonal antibody), clone SP93; and PMS2 (Postmeiotic Segregation Increased, mouse monoclonal antibody) clone A16-4. The 4-primary antibody panel has different staining protocols, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The entire process is automated and deparaffinization is performed using EZ prep and CC1 fluids, and the immunohistochemical reaction is performed in combination with Optiview DAB IHC detection kit and additional reagents Hematoxylin II and Bluing Reagent. The PMS2 antibody requires the OptiView DAB amplification kit to improve signal visibility. Visualization is performed using hydrogen peroxidase with DAB kit. Microsatellite instability was determined immunohistochemically on operative material and associated endoscopic biopsy. Immunohistochemically, microsatellite-unstable carcinomas were considered as tumors in which there was a loss of expression of at least one of the four markers used (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2). Loss of expression is considered as negativity of all tumor nuclei with a positive internal control (positive nuclei of stromal, inflammatory or non-tumor epithelial cells) ( Figs. 2 and 3 Fig. 2 Negative MLH1, positive inflammatory cells (magnification X200). Fig. 3 Positive MLH1 (magnification X200). Data analysis Continuous data were presented as means, standard deviations and medians, and plotted using the box-and-whisker methods ( 31 31 Prognostic subgroups were identified using recursive partitioning, implemented as the rpart module (acronym for Recursive PARTitioning in the R software) ( 32 33 26 27 26 27 26 27 34 The difference in survival between patients in terminal nodes was analyzed by the Gehan-Wilcoxon test and presented as survival curves based on the Kaplan-Meier method ( 30 30 All data steps were performed using R data analysis software version 3.5.1, using the following module: rpart for survival tree; survival module to calculate the difference in HR between the right and left branch of terminal modes in the survival tree, and the EZR module for Kaplan-Meier curves and the Gehan-Wilcoxon test ( 35 36 Results The study analyzed data on 89 patients with CRC stage II. Their demographic data, CEA, follow-up data, and number of censored data are shown in Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics, histopathologic parameters, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, follow-up and censor data, and type of therapy  Variable  Value  No. of patients 89 Gender 28 (31.5) Males, n (%) 61 (68.5) Age (years) 70.4±10 Females, mean ± SD, median 70.5±7.90, 68 Males, mean ± SD, median 70.4±10.90, 72 Histologic type 79 (88.8) Mucinous, n (%) 10 (11.2) Localization 26 (29.2) Left colon, n (%) 30 (33.7) Right colon, n (%) 33 (37,0) pT 78 (87.6) pT4a, n (%) 5 (5.6) pT4b, n (%) 6 (6.7) No. lymph nodes collected 14.7 ± 7.94, 14 Lymphovascular invasion 31 (34.3) Negative, n (%) 58 (65.2) Perineural invasion 7 (7.9) Negative, n (%) 82 (92.1) Grade 3 (3.4) Grade 2, n (%) 74 (83.2) Grade 3, n (%) 2 (2.3) Grade 4, n (%) 0 (0) Grade missing data, n (%) 10 (11.1) Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen 8.9±29.9, 1.7 Censor 29 (32.6) Censored observations, n (%) 70 (67.4) Follow-up (months) 69.9 ± 25.84, 72 Type of therapy, n (%) 75 (84.3) Surgery and chemotherapy, n (%) 12 (13.5) Surgery and radiotherapy, n (%) 1 (1.1) Surgery with chemoradiotherapy, n (%) 1 (1.1) The results of the assessment of tumor budding are shown in Table 2 per 2 15 29 et al 30 2 24 Table 2 Table 2 Budding parameters and microsatellite stability/ instability data  Variable  Value Tumor bud count per 10.9±5.99, 10.0  Budding (Nakamura) Score 0, n (%) 29 (32.0) Score 1, n (%) 40 (45.0) Score 2, n (%) 14 (15.7) Score 3, n (%) 6 (6.7)  Tumor budding score (Lugli) Score 0, n (%) 67 (75.3) Score 1, n (%) 16 (18.0) Score 2, n (%) 6 (6.7)  Microsatellite stability/instability Microsatellite stability 75 (84.3) Microsatellite instability 14 (15.7) The prognostic values of the variables listed in Tables 1 and 2 Figure 4 Figure 5 Fig. 4 Importance of individual variables determined by rpart method. Fig. 5 Survival tree constructed using rpart method with three decision nodes (gray) and four terminal nodes (white). Three variables used in decision nodes were number of examined lymph nodes; total number of buds per 0.785 mm2; and lymphovascular invasion. Four decision nodes describe identified risk subgroups. Hazard ratio (HR) progressively grows from the left to the right. However, it should be noted that the AJCC criteria for prognostic studies require that the prognostic value of a variable must always be evaluated in the context of other variables ( 26 28 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 per 2 Fig. 6 Difference in patient survival (Kaplan-Meier method) for the left and right branches of the first decision node which uses the number of harvested lymph nodes as a separation criterion. Three decision nodes divide patients into four terminal nodes. HR increases progressively from the left to the right side of Figure 5 Furthermore, the difference in patient survival for the left and right branches of each decision node are shown in Figures 7-8 31 Fig. 6 Fig. 7 Difference in patient survival (Kaplan-Meier method) for the left and right branches of the second decision node which uses the total number of buds per 0.784 mm2 as a separation criterion. Fig. 8 Difference in patient survival (Kaplan-Meier method) for the left and right branches of the third decision node which uses lymphovascular invasion as a separation criterion. Discussion Stage II CRC is a diagnostic, prognostic and treatment challenge. It is not easy to decide whether a patient will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or not ( 2 1 The algorithm was obtained using recursive partitioning ( 26 28 Figure 5 28 The results obtained suggest that the prognosis of patients with stage II CRC depends on a combination of three factors. They are (in the order of importance): a small number of examined lymph nodes is associated with very high-risk patients (HR=2.5, n=14). This strongly suggests that reliable assessment of prognosis depends on the size and quality of the tissue sample. All patients without an adequate number of lymph nodes examined (less than 8 lymph nodes) should be considered a priori Figs. 5 and 6 biological aggressiveness of the tumor which is manifested in a high total number of buds per 2 Figs. 5 and 7 positive LVI in patients with a sufficient number of lymph nodes examined and a small number of total buds is a negative prognostic factor (HR=1.1, n=22). However, HR=1.1 represents the HR obtained when comparing all patients (N=89). The actual negative prognostic effect of positive LVI is better assessed if we compare only the left and right branches of the third node ( Figs. 5 and 8 Figs. 5 and 8 patients with an adequate number of lymph nodes examined, a small number of buds and negative LVI represent a low-risk subgroup (HR=0.41, n=42). It is important to note that this subgroup contained a significant number of patients, i.e., 42 of 89 patients ( Fig. 5 An obvious advantage of the prognostic algorithm proposed is its simplicity as it requires only HE staining, without image analysis and specialized software. The most complex part is determining the total number of buds, which requires experience and a tolerable working time. It is important to note that the obtained values of the survival tree are not the optimal values of individual variables, that is, the algorithm should be viewed as a whole. As an information unit, it is necessary to evaluate the number of lymph nodes examined, total number of buds per 2 28 The results of this study should be evaluated in a prospective study. However, it is a good starting point for planning a larger study because results obtained from survival trees are very robust and provide reliable and valid conclusions in most clinical situations ( 37 References 1 Jessup JM, Goldberg RM, Asare EA, Benson AB 3rd, Brierley JD, Chang GJ, et al.
