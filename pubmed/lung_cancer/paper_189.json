Here, we utilized a platform incorporating transcriptomic profiling, high-throughput drug screening, and murine models to demonstrate the preclinical efficacy of several combinatorial regimens against ICB-resistant melanoma. Transcriptomic analysis of ICB-resistant melanomas demonstrated activation of several targetable pathways. High-throughput drug screening targeting these pathways identified several effective combinations in ICB-resistant patient-derived xenograft models. The combination of cobimetinib and regorafenib (termed Cobi+Reg) emerged as a particularly promising regimen, with efficacy against distinct molecular melanoma subtypes and after progression on ICB in immunocompetent models. Transcriptomic and spatial analysis of Cobi+Reg–treated tumors demonstrated upregulation of antigen presentation machinery, with concomitantly increased activated T cell infiltration. Combining Cobi+Reg with ICB was superior to either modality in vivo. This analytical platform exploits the biology of ICB-resistant melanoma to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities, resulting in the identification of drug combinations that form the basis for rational clinical trial design in the setting of advanced melanoma resistant to ICB.  This study leverages the biology of melanoma resistant to immune checkpoint blockade to identify effective combinatorial therapies that form the basis for rational clinical trial design for this treatment-refractory patient population.

Initially, we aimed to comprehend unique features of the biology of ICB-resistant melanoma in our own patient population. To this end, we performed bulk RNA-Seq analysis comparing 14 metastatic melanoma tumors from patients whose disease progressed after PD-1 blockade versus 15 tumors from treatment-naive patients with metastatic melanoma ( Supplemental Table 1 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI185220DS1 Figure 1A Supplemental Table 2 Figure 1B Figure 1C FN1 CD44 NRAS MAPK1 HK2 PGK1 MCL1 TNFRSF1B Supplemental Table 2 NDUFA3 NDUFB1 Supplemental Table 2 15 18 Figure 1D Figure 1E Supplemental Figure 1A Supplemental Figure 1B Supplemental Figure 1C Figure 1F Figure 1G Pharmacological targeting of ICB-resistant melanoma. In order to develop a therapeutic strategy to target ICB-resistant melanoma, we designed a custom high-throughput drug screening (HTDS) ( Supplemental Table 3 19 26 27 max Supplemental Table 3 Figure 2A Supplemental Figure 2A Supplemental Table 4 max max max Supplemental Figure 2B Supplemental Table 5 max Figure 2B Supplemental Table 6 Figure 2C Supplemental Table 7 Figure 2B Figure 2C 28 Figure 2, D–F Antitumor activity of combinatorial drug therapy. Based on these results, 4 drug combinations were selected for in vivo determination of antitumor activity in MM-337 ( Figure 3A BRAF Supplemental Table 1 NF-1 Figure 3B NRAS Figure 3C BRAF NRAS NF-1 Supplemental Figure 2C Supplemental Table 8 Supplemental Figure 2D We then evaluated whether effective combinatorial therapy affects the molecular profiles of ICB-resistant melanoma. There was a profound reduction in MAPK pathway activity (as evidenced by substantially reduced pERK and pRSK-90 protein levels) after Cobi+Reg and Cobi+Ven treatment in each of the 3 PDX lines tested ( Figure 3, D–F Supplemental Figure 3 Figure 3, D and E Figure 3, G and H Supplemental Figure 3D Figure 4, A–C Supplemental Figure 4 Figure 4D Figure 4, E and F Supplemental Figure 4D Subsequently, we assessed the activity of Cobi+Reg (as well as other promising drug combinations) in the B16F10 and YUMM1.7 immunocompetent murine melanoma models, which have been shown to be refractory to ICB ( 29 30 Figure 5, A and B Supplemental Table 9 Figure 5C Figure 5D Supplemental Figure 5 3 Figure 5E Figure 5, F and G Supplemental Table 10 31 Transcriptomic analysis of Cobi+Reg-treated tumors. Based on the substantial antitumor activity, including tumor regression, produced by Cobi+Reg treatment across multiple preclinical models, we sought to better understand its mechanism of action. We performed bulk RNA-Seq of Cobi+Reg-treated tumors in the MM-337 and MM-505 models. Supervised hierarchical analysis identified 614 statistically significantly differentially upregulated and 868 downregulated genes ( Figure 6A Supplemental Table 11 Figure 6B CCNB1 CCND1 CDK1 CDC20 Figure 6C Supplemental Figure 6 Figure 6D Supplemental Figure 6C Surprisingly, Gene Ontology analysis identified upregulation of pathways involving antigen processing, MHC class Ib, and response to type 1 IFN ( Figure 6E HLA B HLA C HLA E HLA-A B2M 32 Figure 6F Supplemental Figure 6D Figure 6, G and H Supplemental Figure 7 In addition, we performed multiplex digital spatial profiling analysis of B16F10 in in vivo tumors treated with Cobi+Reg to examine the extent to which combinatorial drug therapy modified the tumor microenvironment ( Figure 7A Figure 7B Taken together, these results suggest that Cobi+Reg treatment can improve antigen presentation, thereby activating a repertoire of immune cells that can mediate an antitumor response. To investigate this further, we assessed various T cell subsets in B16F10 and YUMM1.7 melanoma tumors in vivo after treatment with Cobi+Reg. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated statistically significant increases in the total CD8a-positive population in Cobi+Reg-treated tumors ( Figure 7, C and D Supplemental Figure 8A Figure 7, C and E Supplemental Figure 8 Figure 7, C and F Supplemental Figure 8 B2M Figure 7G Identification of additional active MAPK inhibitor–VEGF inhibitor combinations. Finally, we explored whether combined targeting of MAPK and angiogenic pathways could more broadly recapitulate the antitumor activity observed. We developed an additional HTDS platform consisting of clinically approved MEK inhibitors and several multi-kinase inhibitors with antiangiogenic (including anti-VEGF) properties. Testing of all available combinations in the 3 PDX lines and 2 murine lines in culture showed a range of activity for the various combinations tested ( Figure 7H Supplemental Table 12 Figure 5D Supplemental Figure 5 Figure 5G Discussion In this study, we aimed to develop a combinatorial therapeutic approach to target ICB-resistant melanoma. RNA-Seq analysis of ICB-resistant metastatic melanoma tumors identified multiple potentially druggable genes and pathways. An HTDS targeting these pathways identified several active drug combinations that were validated in vivo in multiple PDX models encompassing the major molecular subtypes of melanoma derived from patients who progressed on PD-1–based ICB therapy. The Cobi+Reg combination emerged as the lead candidate and was further validated in immunocompetent murine melanoma models, including after progression on ICB therapy. RNA-Seq and spatial analysis of Cobi+Reg-treated tumors indicated upregulation of genes that promote antigen presentation and the adaptive immune response, which was accompanied by increased intratumoral activated T cell subsets, helping to promote increased activity of triple drug therapy (Cobi+Reg with PD-1 blockade) in the B16F10 model. Our results are noteworthy for several reasons. To begin with, our study utilized the biology of ICB-resistant melanoma to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. Bulk RNA-Seq analysis identified several differentially expressed genes involved in key protumorigenic pathways, including angiogenesis, MAPK signaling, antiapoptosis, and glycolysis that could explain the persistent survival of melanoma cells after treatment with ICB. Our results serve to extend the information provided by multiple prior studies that have defined the molecular landscape of melanoma in the setting of ICB resistance. These studies have demonstrated the contribution of various genetic programs or signaling pathways to immunotherapy resistance, including activation of angiogenesis ( 33 34 35 36 37 38 32 37 38 HLA-A/B/C) B2M 32 34 38 B2M The transcriptomic profiles of ICB-resistant melanoma formed the basis for designing an HTDS platform to identify targeted agents with potential antitumor activity. The drugs selected included those that impinged on the pathways identified by RNA-Seq analysis as well as drugs that targeted known pathway vulnerabilities present in melanoma cells. Several active combinations were identified by this analysis both in culture and in vivo, indicating the robustness of the HTDS platform. Specifically, Cobi+Reg and Cobi+Ven were shown to have substantial antitumor activity in multiple PDX models of ICB-resistant melanoma and were shown to be more active than either of the agents when administered alone. Overall, the Cobi+Reg combination emerged as a particularly promising combination, with marked in vivo antitumor activity demonstrated against ICB-resistant PDX models encompassing the major molecular melanoma subtypes (i.e., BRAF NRAS NF-1 Braf V600E Cdkn2a Pten 39 3 Taken together, our results identify Cobi+Reg as a promising therapeutic combination for salvage of advanced melanoma after progression on ICB. In addition, these results show that triple therapy (that included PD-1 blockade) resulted in increased antitumor efficacy, suggesting the potential utility of this regimen in the therapy of treatment-naive advanced melanoma. To our knowledge, this combinatorial approach has not been investigated clinically in any malignancy. Beyond Cobi+Reg, our expanded HTDS screen identified several intriguing combinations, including MEK inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors, reinforcing the importance of these pathways to the survival of ICB-resistant melanoma. This was supported by the substantial activity of Cobi+Paz in vivo, including after progression on ICB. Overall, given the activity of several combinations in the setting of ICB resistance, our studies provide a rational framework for clinical trial design focused on this treatment-refractory patient population, including a compelling rationale for a prospective clinical trial examining the activity of one or more of the regimens identified herein (e.g., Cobi+Reg, Cobi+Paz, or Cobi+Ven) after progression on PD-1–based immunotherapy, or of Cobi+Reg with PD-1 blockade in the advanced metastatic melanoma setting. An unanticipated finding of this study was the observation of immune activation after Cobi+Reg treatment in vivo suggested by both RNA-Seq and spatial analyses of treated tumors. However, this observation is supported by prior studies demonstrating that MEK inhibition alone can exert proimmunogenic effects ( 40 41 + + 42 B2M In conclusion, our studies exploit the biology of melanoma resistant to ICB to identify several active drug combinations, specifically introducing Cobi+Reg after progression on immunotherapy or combined with ICB in the treatment-naive setting.
