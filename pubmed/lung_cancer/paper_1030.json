However, the clinical impact of temporary interruptions of Atez and Bev on treatment outcomes remains unclear. Objective To evaluate the association between temporary interruptions of Atez or Bev and survival outcomes among patients with unresectable HCC. Design Exploratory post hoc analysis of patient-level data from the phase 3 IMbrave150 ( NCT03434379 Setting Global, multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of Atez plus Bev compared with sorafenib in patients with unresectable HCC. Participants A total of 251 patients with unresectable HCC who received Atez and Bev in the IMbrave150 trial. Exposures Temporary interruptions of Atez or Bev during treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results Among 251 patients treated with Atez/Bev, 79 (31.5%) experienced Atez interruptions and 86 (34.3%) had Bev interruptions. Interruptions were not significantly associated with OS (HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.90-2.73 for Atez, HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.16-1.53 for Bev). However, both were significantly associated with improved PFS (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.92 for Atez and HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.94 for Bev). Subgroup analyses showed that positive association of PFS and interruptions was primarily observed in patients with events or treatment duration <12 months. Early (within 6 months) and late interruptions (after 6 months) showed trends toward longer PFS but were not statistically significant (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.27-1.15 and HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.29-1.09 for Atez, HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.37-1.02, and HR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.29-1.27 for Bev). Conclusions and Relevance In this exploratory analysis, temporary interruptions of Atez or Bev were not associated with worse survival outcomes in patients with unresectable HCC.

Future prospective studies should explore mechanisms and refine interruption strategies to optimize treatment outcomes in HCC. Introduction Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atez/Bev) has become the standard first-line therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This follows the landmark IMbrave150 trial which demonstrated its superior efficacy over sorafenib in terms of both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). 1 , 2 3 Despite its benefits, Atez/Bev therapy is often interrupted temporarily due to adverse events (AEs) such as immune-related toxicities or bleeding risks in clinical trials. 4 , 5 Several recent studies have primarily focused on the impact of bevacizumab interruptions on oncologic outcomes, with inconsistent findings. Two studies identified interruptions of Bev negatively affected survival, 6 , 7 5 , 8 , 9 10 11–15 To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective analysis of individual patient-level data from the IMbrave150 trial to evaluate the impact of temporary Atez and Bev interruptions on OS and PFS, using time-dependent Cox regression to account for immortal time bias. By characterizing interruption patterns and their time-dependent association with survival, we aim to inform clinical decision-making and optimize treatment strategies for patients undergoing Atez/Bev therapy. Methods Study design and patients This study was a retrospective analysis based on patient-level data from the IMbrave150 trial ( NCT03434379 https://vivli.org/ 1 , 2 For the purpose of this analysis, we focused on patients who received Atez/Bev and were eligible under the intention-to-treat and safety analysis populations. Individuals who experienced grade five adverse events, as defined by the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, were excluded to avoid confounding by mortality unrelated to treatment interruptions. This is a secondary analysis based on IMbrave150 study. The Data Use Agreement with Research Plan is proved by the Vivli platform ( https://search.vivli.org/ https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03434379 Assessment of treatment interruptions According to IMbrave150 trial protocol, if patients transiently interrupted or permanently discontinued either Atez or Bev due to an adverse event, single-agent therapy was allowed if the patient was experiencing clinical benefit. Therefore, interruptions of Atez and Bev were assessed individually. Temporary drug interruption was defined as either temporarily skipping the corresponding drug until the next treatment cycle or delaying the administration date of the next cycle. The timing of interruption was measured as the interval from treatment initiation to the missed or delayed dose. Interruption duration was calculated as the number of 3-week cycles elapsed between two consecutive doses when a gap occurred, with each cycle corresponding to approximately 21 days. Reasons for interruptions (eg, immune-related AEs, bleeding, or infections) were not available in the dataset. Clinical outcomes To evaluate the impact of interruptions on clinical outcomes, the endpoint OS and PFS were analyzed individually. OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression per IRF-RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Statistical analysis Descriptive analysis of demographic factors available in IMbrave150 were performed. To investigate the comparability of patients with and without drug interruptions, baseline patient characteristics were also summarized for each group. Continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges according to the data distribution. For comparisons between groups, the student’s t U To minimize immortal time bias, the impact of temporary drug interruptions on OS and PFS were analyzed using time-varying covariate Cox regression model. 16 17 Table 1 Table 1.

A sample R code for fitting the Cox model with time-varying covariates and baseline covariates is available in the cited reference to support reproducibility. To explore whether the effects of treatment interruption varied over time, subgroup analysis was conducted by time to event (<12 months vs ≥12 months). In the analysis of <12 months subgroup, patients who died and progressed after 12 months were regarded as censored at 12 months and drug interruptions were only assessed until 12 months after the drug initiation. In the analysis of ≥12 months subgroup, patients who died and progressed before 12 months were excluded. A subgroup analysis was also conducted by treatment durations (<12 months vs ≥12 months), without adjustment of treatment durations. Given the retrospective nature of the study, no adjustments for multiplicity were applied in these subgroup analyses.

Subgroup analyses indicated that the association between interruptions and longer PFS was primarily observed in patients who achieved PFS within 12 months of treatment initiation and in patients with shorter treatment durations (<12 months). We did not observe differences between association of early interruptions versus late interruptions on survival outcomes, with both showing a trend toward longer PFS. Given the nonsignificant findings for OS and the exploratory nature of the analysis, these observations should be interpreted with caution. To the best of our knowledge, limited evidence exists regarding interruptions of Atez/Bev, with most studies focusing exclusively on Bev. Several research reported either neutral or detrimental association of interruptions in Bev therapy on the survival outcomes of patients with HCC undergoing combination treatment with Atez and Bev. 5–10 8 14 , 15 10 P The mechanism underlying the observed association between treatment interruptions and improved PFS is not fully elucidated. One hypothesis is that temporary drug holds in response to adverse events may correlate with effective immune activation 18 19 18 20 21–23 6 Interestingly, the positive association of drug interruption and prolonged PFS was predominantly observed in the first 12 months, with no significant association seen in patients who progressed beyond 12 months. This temporal specificity suggests that treatment interruption may play a different role across distinct phases of disease evolution or therapy response. One plausible explanation is that early responders to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab may experience toxicities (eg, hypertension, proteinuria) that necessitate temporary treatment holds without compromising short-term disease control. 24 , 25 7 When comparing early versus late interruptions, our analysis did not reveal significant differences in clinical outcomes, with both timepoints demonstrating comparable trends of associations toward improved PFS. This observation challenges the conventional hypothesis that earlier interruptions during the critical immune-priming phase would necessarily yield more detrimental effects than later interruptions. 20 6 2 10 These findings suggest that temporary Atez or Bev interruptions, particularly in response to AEs (eg, hypertension or proteinuria), may not compromise short-term disease control. Clinicians could consider resuming therapy after AE resolution, monitoring patients closely during interruptions, and tailoring strategies based on AE types and patient responses. For example, interruptions due to immune-related AEs may require longer recovery periods but could still allow continuation of treatment. Several limitations should be acknowledged in interpreting our findings. First, the study was retrospective and exploratory in nature, and patients who resumed treatment following interruptions may represent a biologically favorable subset with better treatment tolerance or underlying disease control. Although time-dependent modeling was used to mitigate immortal time bias, baseline characteristics such as ECOG and other factors appeared balanced between groups and multivariate adjustment addressed some confounding factors, residual bias due to unmeasured variables remains an inherent limitation. The findings should be interpreted with caution. Second, the sample size in certain subgroups, particularly those with early or short-duration interruptions, was relatively small, potentially limiting statistical power to detect modest associations and resulting in wide confidence intervals for some estimates. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limited precision. Third, the specific reasons for treatment interruptions (eg, immune-related AEs, bleeding, or infections) were not available in the dataset. Although the interruptions of Atez or Bev were assessed individually, future studies incorporating detailed causality data would further strengthen the validity of these findings. Despite these limitations, our findings provide valuable insights into the clinical implications of treatment interruption patterns in Atez and Bev therapy and warrant further prospective validation. Conclusion In conclusion, this exploratory analysis of IMbrave150 data suggests that temporary interruptions of Atez or Bev in unresectable HCC were not associated with worse survival outcomes, particularly within the first 12 months of treatment. Early and late interruptions showed similar patterns in their association with survival, although shorter Atez interruptions (≤2 cycles) were linked to numerically lower OS, warranting further investigation. These findings support the safety of temporary interruptions in response to AEs, provided therapy is resumed after AE resolution. Prospective studies, such as randomized trials comparing planned interruptions versus continuous therapy, are needed to validate these observations and optimize interruption strategies in Atez/Bev therapy for advanced HCC.
