They are involved in diverse physiological processes, including development and homeostasis, and are also implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, most notably cancer. While NR activity is primarily regulated by specific ligand binding, posttranslational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, also play a critical role in modulating their function. Recently, we identified a novel signaling pathway linking claudins (CLDNs), cell‐cell adhesion proteins, to NRs. CLDN‐mediated cell‐cell adhesion activates Src family kinases (SFKs), leading to serine phosphorylation of several NRs. This newly‐discovered CLDN–NR pathway contributes to epithelial differentiation in stem cells and promotes cancer progression. In this review, we discuss the biological significance and underlying mechanisms of this, tracing the development of our research. cancer claudins estrogen nuclear receptors retinoic acid tight junction The authors received no specific funding for this work. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025 Abbreviations CLDN claudin ESC embryonic stem cell NR nuclar receptor PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase RA retinoic acid SFK Src family kinase 1 Introduction Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a class of transcription factors that bind to DNA through zinc finger motifs and regulate gene expression in response to various lipid signaling molecules. In humans, 48 different types of NRs have been identified, including retinoid receptors, sex hormone receptors, adrenal hormone receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, and orphan receptors [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 18 25 NRs regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand‐dependent manner, and ligand binding alters their intracellular distribution and/or interactions with transcriptional cofactors (Figure 1A 1 1B 26 27 28 29 30 2 31 32 33 34 35 36 Figure 1 Regulatory mechanisms of nuclear receptor activity. (A) Classical regulatory model. Nuclear receptors alter their transcriptional activity through binding to specific ligands. Most lipid ligands are converted into active forms by intracellular metabolic enzymes. Upon ligand binding, nuclear receptors either shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (e.g., androgen receptor) or remain stably bound to DNA within the nucleus (e.g., retinoic acid receptors). (B) Updated regulatory model. Nuclear receptor activity is regulated not only by ligand binding but also by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Many signaling molecules contribute to modulation of nuclear receptor activity, and these nuclear receptors are key endpoints in diverse signaling cascades. Figure 2 CLDN‐nuclear receptor signaling pathway. CLDN4 and CLDN6 activate Src family kinases (SFKs) in an adhesion‐dependent manner. SFKs sequentially activate PI3K and AKT. Nuclear receptors, including RARγ, ERα, LXRβ, and LRH1, are phosphorylated by AKT at serine residues near their ligand‐binding pockets, leading to altered transcriptional activity. This process induces epithelial differentiation in stem cells and promotes malignant phenotypes in various cancers. 2 Discovery of Cell‐Cell Adhesion‐Nuclear Receptor Signaling Pathway F9 is an embryonal carcinoma cell line derived from the teratocarcinoma of the testis of male mice implanted with 7‐day mouse embryos [ 37 3A 38 39 40 Figure 3 Epithelial differentiation of F9 stem cells. (A) F9 cells differentiate into epithelial cells upon treatment with retinoic acid (RA). Epithelial differentiation can also be induced by overexpression of HNF4α or CLDN6. (B) F9 cells with double knockout of RXRα and RARγ fail to differentiate, even when treated with RA or CLDN6. (C) Summary of epithelial differentiation in F9 cells following overexpression, knockout, or rescue experiments involving indicated genes. Phosphorylation of RARγ at serine 379 (RARγ‐S379) by CLDN6 adhesion signaling enhances RA sensitivity. dKO, double‐knockout; High, 1000 nM of all‐trans retinoc acid; Low, 1 nM of all‐trans retinoic acid; Epi. Diff., epithelial differentiation. While the induction of epithelial differentiation in F9 cells by RA has been well‐established, the underlying mechanisms were still obscure due to the multifaceted interactions of RA with various NRs, including RAR and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPAR), as well as non‐NR proteins located in the cytoplasm. By employing a genetic knockout strategy that targeted both RXRα ( RXRA RARG RXRα  –/– :RARγ  –/– 3B 39 41 We then developed a dual conditional system in F9 cells, comprising tamoxifen‐inducible Cre‐loxP recombination and doxycycline‐inducible gene expression (a Tet‐ON system) [ 42 43 44 45 46 3A 33 47 48 49 50 44 45 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 Therefore, we established a CLDN6‐overexpressing cell line (F9: Cldn6 45 59 44 60 46 61 62 3A 63 To assess this hypothesis, we overexpressed CLDN6 in the F9: RXRα  –/– :RARγ  –/– RXRα  –/– :RARγ  –/– :CLDN6 3C 31 63 64 65 66 RXRα  –/– :RARγ  –/– RXRα CLDN6 3C 3C 66 3C 4 Figure 4 AKT‐targeted serine residues in the ligand‐binding domain of nuclear receptors.

Therefore, we investigated whether the CLDN6–ERα pathway also regulates malignant phenotypes in breast cancer. Immunohistochemical evaluation of CLDN6 expression in nearly 200 breast cancer surgical specimens identified only one case as CLDN6‐positive (unpublished data), whereas a previous study reported CLDN6 overexpression in 25% of breast cancers [ 68 67 Among the breast cancer cell lines we investigated, hormone receptor‐positive MCF‐7 and T47D cells exhibited high CLDN4 expression, whereas triple‐negative breast cancer MDA‐MB‐231 cells displayed weak expression. Loss‐of‐function experiments using genetic knockout of CLDN4 in MCF‐7 and T47D cells, as well as gain‐of‐function experiments involving CLDN4 overexpression in MDA‐MB‐231 cells, revealed that CLDN4 positively regulates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in all cases. However, unlike in endometrial cancer cells, RNA sequencing analysis of these breast cancer cells showed limited changes in ERα downstream genes. Instead, significant alterations were observed in genes related to lipid metabolism, particularly in consensus downstream targets of the NR liver X receptors (LXRs). Given that the conserved AKT‐targeted serine residue is also present in LXRs, we investigated their phosphorylation in breast cancer. Among the two LXR isoforms, LXRβ ( NR1H2 NR1H3 2 34 Liver receptor homolog‐1 (LRH1; NR5A2) has been reported as a poor prognostic factor in various cancers [ 69 70 pS510 pS510 pS510 35 pS510 36 BMC Cancer 2 4 Discussion and Conclusion In summary, we demonstrated that signal transduction initiated by intercellular adhesion influences NR‐mediated transcriptional regulation, which plays a crucial role in epithelial differentiation and cancer progression. Supporting this concept, accumulating evidence highlights the ligand‐independent activation of NRs, particularly via phosphorylation. For instance, high‐fat diet‐induced activation of cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 in adipose tissue phosphorylates PPARγ at S273. This modification dysregulates gene expression independently of adipogenesis, thus contributing to insulin resistance [ 71 28 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 Ethics Statement The authors have nothing to report.
