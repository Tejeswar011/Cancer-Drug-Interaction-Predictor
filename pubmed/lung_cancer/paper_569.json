The hazard of procedures differed by sex, body mass index, era, and treatment center and were higher in adults with a primary central venous catheter. This patient and clinician priority outcome can inform shared decision making when planning KRT. Background Patients and clinicians prioritize the need for procedures to maintain hemodialysis vascular access as a core research outcome. The lack of procedural data in population datasets has limited certainty about the frequency of procedural events. Methods This is a national linkage analysis of registry and administrative health data. We included all patients who started KRT between 2004 and 2021 in New Zealand, including data from 2 years before and 2 years after hemodialysis commencement. The incidence rate of vascular access procedures per patient-year was calculated, and a multivariate flexible parametric model was used to estimate associations with demographic and clinical variables. Results In 7725 patients, the average rate of vascular access procedures was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 0.72) procedures per patient-year, median 2 (quartiles 1–3) procedures. The hazard of procedures was associated with sex (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] female versus male, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.13) and body mass index (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.24 body mass index >35 kg/m 2 Conclusions Half of the adults underwent two or fewer hemodialysis vascular access procedures in the 4-year period before and after hemodialysis commencement. Procedural rates differed by sex, body mass, treatment period, and treatment center and were higher in adults with a primary central venous catheter. arteriovenous access arteriovenous fistula arteriovenous graft dialysis dialysis access hemodialysis hemodialysis access vascular access Health Research Council of New Zealand 22/105 Katherine G.

Access complications can make maintaining vascular access challenging. Surgical and radiologic interventions may be required and are highly burdensome for patients and expensive for health systems. 1 10 11 12 The overall rate of procedures required to maintain any form of functioning vascular access, either arteriovenous fistula (AVF), arteriovenous graft (AVG), or central venous catheter (CVC), is uncertain. The health outcomes related to dialysis vascular access in research have historically been highly heterogenous and are frequently reported according to access form (AVF, AVG, or CVC) rather than reflecting the common patient experience of moving between multiple access forms. 2 3 5 13 16 1 4 12 13 17 We hypothesized that the overall rate of vascular access procedures was estimable through linkage of administrative hospitalization data with a national dialysis registry in New Zealand. We aimed to estimate the rate of vascular access procedures required to create and maintain vascular access and to identify associated patient and health care system level factors among adults receiving primary (first ever) vascular access. Methods We linked data from a clinical quality registry, the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), with a national administrative hospitalization database (the National Minimum Dataset) to obtain records for all patients who commenced treatment for advanced kidney failure and had related dialysis vascular access procedures. 18 19 20 21 Study Population Adults were eligible if they were 18 years or older, registered in the registry at commencement of KRT (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation), and underwent a hemodialysis vascular access procedure. Adults were ineligible if they had commenced hemodialysis overseas or had a kidney transplant before their first hemodialysis vascular access procedure. Data Collection Procedures The ANZDATA is a clinical quality registry combining data related to all adults and children who have commenced dialysis or kidney transplantation for the treatment of kidney failure in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand since 1977. 18 19 Supplemental Table 1 Data were requested from both sources through usual procedures, from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2021. Data linkage was performed using the National Health Index number as a single linkage key. 22 23 24 Primary vascular access was defined as the first hemodialysis vascular access recorded in either dataset. AVF and AVG were combined due to low numbers of AVGs and poor precision of the procedural codes differentiating the two. The process of determining primary access is presented in Supplemental Figure 1 Covariates The causes of advanced CKD, treatment, and coexisting conditions were obtained from the registry. The New Zealand Deprivation Index and the Geographic Classification for Health Rurality classification were estimated from each patient's domicile (a small geographic unit) in administrative records at the hospitalization closest to the date when primary vascular access was formed. 25 26 27 28 We included primary access type (AVF or AVG or CVC) as a covariate of interest. Previous research has demonstrated that hemodialysis vascular access type is highly confounded by selection bias, so the results were not interpreted for identifying superior access forms. 4 5 29 30 Outcomes The primary outcome was the rate of vascular access procedures from 2 years before and 2 years after hemodialysis incidence. When two access procedures occurred on the same day, these were assumed to have occurred as part of the same intervention and were combined for analysis of procedure rates. The secondary outcome was the association between baseline covariates and the hazard of vascular access procedures. Missing data were anticipated and data sources combined for key variables. 31 32 Patients who underwent a primary vascular access procedure and did not start hemodialysis were censored at 2 years after their primary procedure. We censored patients if they moved overseas, changed dialysis modality to peritoneal dialysis, received a kidney transplant, or died. Considerations for Health Research Involving Indigenous Peoples Māori are the Indigenous Peoples of New Zealand. The responsibility of the government to ensure active protection of Māori wellbeing is governed by the Treaty of Waitangi. The institution under which this study was conducted (the University of Otago) has a Memorandum of Understanding with Kāi Tahu, the university's principal Treaty of Waitangi partner. Institutional governance of this study included a priori 33 Statistical Analysis We estimated baseline variables as either mean (SD) or median (25th percentile–75th percentile) for continuous variables depending on the distribution and count (proportions) for binary and categorical variables, including the type and frequency of vascular access interventions. The overall rate of vascular access procedures per patient-year was calculated as the number of events divided by the person-time at risk for 2 years before and 2 years after dialysis commencement. This rate was then calculated according to primary vascular access form, and vascular access experience (primary arteriovenous access with either incident arteriovenous access or incident CVC, and primary CVC with either no subsequent arteriovenous formations or subsequent arteriovenous access, for the periods before and after hemodialysis initiation. The number of formation procedures experienced by patients was identified. A Royston-Parmer model was used to conduct flexible parametric survival analysis estimating the hazard of vascular access procedures associated with patient baseline characteristics. We used the Prentice Williams Peterson Gap Time model to model multiple events per patient. 34 Procedures were censored after seven procedures for each patient, as after this number, there were few data to support estimation. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using only patients who had recorded (rather than imputed) procedures, for the periods before and after dialysis initiation, removing the cohort with left censored procedural data, and additional sensitivity analysis used a Poisson model to allocate all prehemodialysis and posthemodialysis procedure events to the time the patient received incident hemodialysis treatment. The stpm2 command was used for flexible parametric models. 35 An unadjusted and adjusted comparison of patient baseline characteristics between patients with missing and nonmissing CVC codes was undertaken using logistic regression. We summarized the unadjusted and adjusted odds of a primary CVC compared with an AVF or AVG using logistic regression. We included all baseline characteristics as variables in all multivariate analyses as the purpose was exploratory rather than predictive. Continuous covariates were age and body mass index (BMI). Age was included as a fractional polynomial term in logistic regression because of the nonlinear relationship between age and primary access ( Supplemental Figure 2 2 36 Results Patient Characteristics Overall, 10,064 adults were available in the registry (Figure 1 1 Figure 1 Derivation of the study cohort.

Missing Data In the registry, 5199 patients were reported to have commenced hemodialysis with an incident CVC. An additional 163 patients had no incident vascular access recorded in the registry, and because they had no preemptive arteriovenous procedures in administrative data, they were assumed to have had incident CVC. Of the resulting 5592 patients, 2850 (51.0%) patients had missing CVC codes in administrative data; these procedures were imputed as occurring on the day of hemodialysis commencement. Most of the patients with missing administrative data were hospitalized at the time of hemodialysis initiation (2258, 79.2%). Of the 1810 patients with an incident AVF or AVG, 1605 (88.7%) had formation procedures recorded in the administrative data before hemodialysis commencement (Figure 2 Figure 2 Identification of CVC insertions at hemodialysis commencement missing from the administrative dataset. Rates of Vascular Access Procedures during Follow-Up Overall, 7725 patients underwent 18,315 unique procedures in 17,580 procedure events, during 24,667 patient-years of analysis. Patients with primary CVC had a median follow-up of 2.93 (quartiles 2.22–4.00) person-years, and those with primary AVF or AVG access had median follow-up of 4.00 (quartiles 3.06–4.00) person-years. The median number of procedures per person was 2 (quartiles 1–3; range 1–18). Of the total study cohort, 3613 patients (46.8%) had one access formed, 2228 (28.8%) had two, 996 (12.9%) had three, and 671 (8.7%) had four or more (Figure 3 Figure 3 Incidence rate of vascular access procedures per patient-year for 2 years before and 2 years after hemodialysis commencement*. The incidence rate of hemodialysis vascular access procedures was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 0.72) procedures per patient-year.

The hazard of additional vascular access procedures were similar when analyses were limited to adults who had recorded procedures in the hospitalization database and when limited to adults who identified as Indigenous Māori or Pacific Peoples (see Supplemental Tables 2–4 Supplemental Tables 5-7 Factors Associated with Primary Vascular Access A primary AVF or AVG was recorded in 2363 patients (30.6%) and CVC in 5362 (69.4%; Table 1 4 Of the 2363 patients who had a primary AVF or AVG procedure recorded, the median time from access formation to hemodialysis initiation was 150 days (quartiles 67–342). Of these patients, 396 (16.8%) subsequently commenced hemodialysis with a CVC. Discussion We estimated the overall rate of vascular access procedures experienced by adults in the 2-year period before and after commencing hemodialysis in a single country through linkage of registry and hospitalization data. Patients experienced less than one procedure per patient-year on average with a median of two procedures. A quarter of patients experienced four or more procedures. There was important variation in procedure hazards at a dialysis center level with hazards lower in more recent years. There were higher risks of intervention associated with being female and higher BMI. This study provides estimations of the patient experience and health system demands of hemodialysis vascular access formation and maintenance before and after hemodialysis incidence. Direct comparison of our results with other cohorts is difficult due to the lack of comparator studies against which to benchmark. Other studies have provided complication, admission, and procedural rates for specific access forms or analyzed specific complications. 1 3 5 6 37 38 39 Our finding that female patients are less likely to start dialysis with an arteriovenous access and have greater procedural rates than males is consistent with previous research. 40 42 43 Variation in outcomes according to BMI is evident in our study. A higher BMI was associated with primary arteriovenous access. This suggests an influence of BMI on predialysis planning and processes; however, such an association has not been formally described. Patients of higher BMI also had a higher adjusted procedure rate than patients of a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. Our findings and previous literature suggest that a higher BMI is associated with complication-related AVF and AVG and CVCs; however, it is unclear if these associations should influence clinical decision making regarding access choices. 44 47 Overall, patient demographic and clinical characteristics had a smaller contribution to procedural rates in our study than treatment era and the treating center. This may be contrary to expectations, given the number of studies that have identified variations in vascular access outcomes among different patient groups. 39 48 49 50 Multiple factors may influence the larger hazard of procedures associated with primary CVC. Our data and previous studies demonstrate selection bias in analyses by primary access, as patients who receive primary CVC have additional coexisting conditions, higher rates of late referral, and differing patterns of primary kidney disease than those with primary AVF or AVG. 3 29 30 29 30 The strengths of this analysis include the use of a high-quality registry combined with national health data to track multiple vascular access procedures in a national cohort and account for socioeconomic deprivation and rurality. There are limitations in this study, primarily due to the level of detail of the primary source data. First, the proportion of CVC procedures that was missing from administrative data at hemodialysis commencement and the low numbers of CVC removals suggests that the data may underestimated CVC procedure rates at other time points. However, incomplete capture of CVC procedures is a known concern when using administrative data, and it is a strength of this study to have a comparator data source enabling identification of additional procedures and quantification and analysis of administrative procedure capture. 31 32 In conclusion, half of adults commencing hemodialysis underwent two or fewer hemodialysis vascular access procedures in the 4-year period before and after hemodialysis commencement. Procedural rates differed by sex, body mass, treatment period, and treatment center and were higher for adults commencing hemodialysis with a CVC.
