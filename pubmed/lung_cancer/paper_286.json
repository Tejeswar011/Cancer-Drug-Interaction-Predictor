We introduce a framework to predict DOE at gene and gene-disease levels using gene and protein embeddings and genetic associations across the allele frequency spectrum, respectively. Specifically, we predict: (1) DOE-specific druggability for 19,450 protein-coding genes with a macro-averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.95; (2) isolated DOE among 2553 druggable genes with a macro-averaged AUROC of 0.85; and (3) gene-disease-specific DOE for 47,822 gene-disease pairs with a macro-averaged AUROC of 0.59, with performance improving with genetic evidence availability. Our predictions outperform existing approaches, are associated with clinical trial success, and identify novel therapeutic opportunities. We uncover genetic and functional differences between activator and inhibitor targets, allowing DOE inference independent of disease context. This framework represents a valuable tool for target selection and drug development.

For gene-level models, beyond standard tabular features like constraint and essentiality, we include GenePT embeddings of NCBI gene summaries and ProtT5 embeddings of amino acid sequences 21 22 1 Results Characteristics of drugs and druggable genes We identified up to 7341 unique drugs with specified mechanisms of action from five sources. Of these, 46% were in phase IV (approved), 29% were in phase I to III clinical trials, and 25% were under an unspecified phase of investigation. The most common drug types were small molecules (78.7%) and antibodies (8.1%) (Fig. 1A S2A 1B S2B Fig. 1 Characteristics of drugs and targets. A 10 B Activator and inhibitor drug targets have distinct characteristics A prior study of 383 approved drug targets showed that drug targets are more constrained compared to all genes, with inhibitor drug targets being more constrained than activator drug targets 23 rank-sum −44 rank-sum −8 2A 24 16 S3A, B Fig. 2 Characteristics of activator and inhibitor drug targets. A B C D B D While it is counterintuitive that inhibitor targets are more LOF intolerant, since inhibitor drugs achieve efficacy by mimicking LOF, this is likely due to confounding factors 23 Besides constraint and dosage sensitivity, genes involved in autosomal dominant disorders were enriched for both activator and inhibitor mechanisms, whereas genes involved in autosomal recessive disorders were depleted only of inhibitor mechanisms (Fig. 2B 25 2B 2C, D Predicting overall and DOE-specific druggability We trained gene-level models using 41 tabular features (Supplementary Data 1 9 S1 S4A S4B S4C 1 1 S4D Table 1 Recommended cutoffs for each model Model Cutoff F Precision Recall Gene-level druggability predictions Overall 0.35 F 1 0.74 0.75 Activator 0.18 F 1 0.60 0.60 Inhibitor 0.30 F 1 0.71 0.66 Other 0.17 F 1 0.51 0.57 Gene-level DOE predictions Activator 0.27 F 1 0.68 0.69 Inhibitor 0.61 F 1 0.85 0.92 Other 0.41 F 1 0.68 0.75 Gene-disease-specific DOE predictions Activator 0.29 F 0.2 0.31 0.20 Inhibitor 0.69 F 0.2 0.75 0.39 Other 0.30 F 0.2 0.38 0.06 For gene-level predictions, recommended cutoffs are those maximizing the F 1 F 0.2 We next constructed a DOE-specific druggability model, which substantially outperformed DrugnomeAI and predicted druggability via activator, inhibitor, and other mechanisms with AUROCs of 0.95 (95% CI 0.94–0.96), 0.95 (95% CI 0.95–0.96), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.93–0.94), respectively (Fig. 3A S2 3B S5A S5B–D 1 1 S5E–G Fig. 3 Performance of DOE predictions. A B C D B D Both tabular features and embeddings were important across models, with the most important tabular features including research antibody availability, enzyme classification, and mouse knockout phenotypes (Supplementary Data 2 3 3 Without further training, druggability predictions predicted the clinical trial success and disease relevance of drug targets. First, overall druggability predictions outperformed DrugnomeAI in predicting the progression of drug targets from phase I to phase IV (Fig. S6 4 S7A–D 5 8 Predicting DOE among druggable genes To separate DOE from druggability and assess the utility of therapeutic modulation, we trained a DOE prediction model among 2553 druggable genes with known drug DOEs. The model using all features predicted activator, inhibitor, and other mechanisms with AUROCs of 0.87 (95% CI 0.86–0.89), 0.85 (95% CI 0.83–0.86), and 0.83 (95% CI 0.81–0.84), respectively (Fig. 3C S3 3D S8A Activator and inhibitor predictions were weakly negatively correlated (ρ = −0.11, p −8 S8B p −6 p −165 S8C, D S4 5 1 1 S8E–G We performed single-sample gene set enrichment analysis to explain each set of predictions. High inhibitor predictions were enriched for cell cycle progression and cell proliferation sets (Fig. S9A S5 S9B S9C To demonstrate how this model might facilitate novel drug development, we generated DOE predictions for 2179 predicted druggable genes not included in the training set, identifying 199 genes without activator drugs as probable activator targets and 2331 genes without inhibitor drugs as probable inhibitor targets. Manual screening of the top 40 undrugged activator targets showed 33 had an endogenous agonist, 26 had a synthetic agonist, and 23 were associated with treatable phenotypes via activator mechanisms (Supplementary Data 6 We further validated the disease relevance of DOE predictions using Open Targets DOE assessments across 4427 genes and 9217 diseases. Using clinical genetics, genetic associations, and animal models, these assessments determine whether activation or inhibition is therapeutically necessary for each gene-disease pair. Genes with an activator DOE prediction >50th percentile had an OR of 2.00 (95% CI 1.77–2.26) of having an Open Targets activator assessment for any disease, whereas genes with an inhibitor DOE prediction >50th percentile had an OR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.08–1.46) of having an Open Targets inhibitor assessment (Table S6 Genetic evidence predicts the direction of effect As genetic variants can mimic drug effects 26 4A 7 Fig. 4 Using human genetics to predict DOE. A B C D Only 541 gene-disease pairs were supported by Bonferroni-significant genetic associations, too few for robust analyses. However, at p 4B, C 10 p S10A–E S10F Predicting gene-disease-specific DOE We used 31 gene-disease-specific genetic features to predict DOE among 47,822 gene-disease pairs (Fig. 4D 8 5A 9 5B 5C, D 9 Fig. 5 Gene-disease-specific features predict DOE. A B C D C D Given the modest model performance, we recommend prioritizing precision over recall and using higher cutoffs. Optimal cutoffs for maximizing F 0.2 1 S11A–C The most important features were primarily common variant associations (Supplementary Data 10 beta 10 p To demonstrate how these predictions can support novel drug development, we analyzed 56,089 gene-disease pairs not included in our training set that met three criteria: (1) strong target-disease associations from Mantis-ML or Open Targets 5 8 S7 S8 CFH 27 MC4R 28 TERT 29 LRP3 30 KIT 31 Comparing gene-level and gene-disease-specific DOE predictions We next compared gene-level to gene-disease-specific DOE predictions for gene-disease-specific DOE prediction among 47,822 gene-disease pairs, with the two predictions being weakly correlated (Fig. S12A–C S13A S13B 11 1 Nevertheless, gene-disease-specific DOE predictions remain important for three reasons. First, they provide disease-specific context for the ~3% of druggable genes with high gene-level predictions for both activation and inhibition, such as ADRB1 HTR1A S8B S9 9 4 S13C S10 Discussion We present a framework to refine target selection and modulation using three DOE prediction models (Fig. S1 Our findings may offer actionable insights for drug development. Predictions from all three models are calibrated such that the outputs represent the true proportion of positives in each class, but we also provide binary cutoffs that maximize F scores (Table 1 GRM8 32 33 34 4 35 5 8 6 This study has several limitations. First, we relied on existing druggable genes and known drug mechanisms, which may bias predictions toward prevalent drug modalities like small molecules. Although we incorporated data from five drug sources to improve coverage, emerging therapeutic strategies like gene therapies, mRNA-based treatments, and PROTACs may alter the landscape of druggability and DOE feasibility. Second, while embeddings enable the model to learn druggability and DOE patterns independently of human labels, they reduce interpretability compared to tabular features. Third, the clinical trial outcome data we use may underrepresent failed clinical trials. Fourth, we defined diseases for gene-disease models primarily using three-character ICD-10 codes to maximize compatibility with existing summary statistics. However, these codes have variable sensitivity and specificity for capturing disease processes and may have suboptimal granularity. Fifth, we relied on nominally significant genetic associations and predicted GOF and LOF variant classifications for gene-disease-specific analyses, which could have resulted in spurious predictions. Sixth, we do not prospectively validate our models; future evidence from drug development efforts, particularly involving currently undrugged genes, will be necessary to determine whether real-world outcomes are consistent with our predictions. There are also opportunities to extend this work. Our models do not account for the degree of target modulation due to limited training data, but distinguishing between effective modulation and toxicity is critical since many targets have narrow therapeutic windows. Additionally, numerous factors besides DOE contribute to failed drug development, including insufficient causal gene-disease evidence, issues with the drug itself, and suboptimal clinical trial design. These downstream challenges could benefit from complementary computational strategies. In summary, we developed and validated three complementary models for predicting therapeutic DOE. We demonstrate that DOE can be predicted both as a disease-agnostic property using gene-level features and, when sufficient data is available, as a disease-specific property using human genetics evidence. Combining these approaches guides therapeutic modulation strategies and can help accelerate and de-risk drug development. Methods Ethics approval All datasets used in this study were publicly available and de-identified. No ethics approval was necessary. Obtaining drug mechanisms and indications We compiled a comprehensive dataset of drug-target interactions and mechanisms of action by integrating data from multiple sources, including ChEMBL (version 35) 36 8 37 38 39 To create a unified drug mechanism dataset, we first compiled conversions between different identifiers (e.g., ChEMBL IDs, DrugBank IDs, Guide to Pharmacology IDs, PubChem CIDs, and generic drug names) using the PubChem Identifier Exchange Service as well as conversion tables provided by each data source. We then unified drug representations across sources using a disjoint-set approach, assigning a unique ID to each drug entity based on shared identifiers. For each drug, we then merged mechanisms of action from the different sources and classified them as activator, inhibitor, or other (Table S11 For gene-disease-specific models, we obtained drug indications from OTP and from the orphan drug databases of the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. We mapped OTP drug indications to ICD-10 codes using OTP-supplied conversion files and the UMLS Metathesaurus (release 2024AA) and merged this with our drug mechanism dataset via ChEMBL IDs. For orphan drug data, we mapped drug names to ChEMBL IDs using ChEMBL molecule synonyms and manually mapped drug indications to ICD-10 codes (Supplementary Data 12 Features for gene-level models For all gene-level models, we included 425 features: 41 tabular features, gene embedding vectors with 256 dimensions, and protein embedding vectors with 128 dimensions. Descriptions of the 41 tabular features are available in Table S1 40 8 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 18 16 48 49 50 We obtained gene embeddings from GenePT 21 51 S14A S14B We obtained protein embeddings from UniProt, which used the prottrans_t5_xl_u50 model 52 S14C, D To facilitate interpretation of gene and protein embeddings, we used umap-learn (Python package version 0.5.7) to generate two-dimensional representations using n_neighbors = 15 and min_dist = 0.1. Plotting these two dimensions showed that druggable genes, as well as genes targeted by activator, inhibitor, and other mechanism drugs, formed distinct clusters (Fig. S15A, B Constructing machine learning models We trained all machine learning models using XGBoost (Python package version 2.1.3) with a nested eightfold cross-validation framework. In the outer loop, we randomly split the dataset into eightfolds, using one as a holdout test set while training on the remaining data. Within each outer fold, we performed an inner eightfold cross-validation, where onefold served as a validation set and the model was trained on the remaining inner folds. After training, each inner fold model generated predictions on the outer holdout set, and we averaged these predictions across inner folds. Repeating this process for all outer folds ensured a robust evaluation. To prevent overfitting, we used default XGBoost hyperparameters except for min_child_weight = 10 to prevent overly complex splits. We also enabled early stopping after ten rounds of no improvement. To assess feature importance, we enabled SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP; Python package version 0.46.0) when generating holdout predictions. As a sensitivity analysis comparing model types, we compared XGBoost to convolutional neural networks (CNN) and logistic regression (LR) and found that XGBoost outperformed both in predicting overall and DOE-specific druggability (Table S12 Among 24 of the 41 gene-level features with missing values, there was a median missingness rate of 7.1% (range = 0.9–21.0%) (Table S1 To assess whether our models generalize to undercharacterized targets, we performed a second sensitivity analysis where we trained models on well-characterized genes (low PHAROS novelty scores) and evaluated them on less-characterized genes (high PHAROS novelty scores). PHAROS novelty scores represent the relative abundance of publication mentions of each target 53 13 S4 S5 S8A We compared gene-level models to DrugnomeAI, which used XGBoost with 324 features to predict druggability 9 53 54 S13 Clinical trial success We assessed the ability of druggability and DOE predictions to predict clinical trial success using Open Targets data (target-disease evidence by source: ChEMBL). For each phase transition from X to Y, we classified drug targets (for overall druggability), target-DOE pairs (for DOE-specific druggability), and target-DOE-disease triplets (for gene-disease-specific DOE) as successes if any associated drug reached phase Y. We labeled them as failures if they had drugs that progressed to at least phase X but did not advance beyond phase Y-1 and were no longer in active development. We classified the following statuses as active development: recruiting; active, not recruiting; not yet recruiting; enrolling by invitation. For target-DOE pairs and target-DOE-disease triplets, we performed separate analyses for each DOE. Target-disease association scores We used target-disease association scores from Mantis-ML and Open Targets to determine the disease relevance of gene-level druggability and DOE predictions, and to select gene-disease pairs with strong association evidence for gene-disease-specific DOE predictions. Mantis-ML uses a graph neural network with both tabular features and a knowledge graph to rank gene-disease pairs, with data sources including GWAS, OMIM, and biological processes. Open Targets provides individual scores for each of 23 evidence sources that represent evidence strength; these are then unified into a single score via a weighted harmonic sum. Open Targets additionally provides DOE assessments for seven evidence sources (Locus2gene, gene burden, ClinVar germline, ClinVar somatic, Gene2Phenotype, Orphanet, and IMPC) 8 55 59 Disease definitions We defined diseases using three-character ICD-10 codes to maximize phenotype compatibility with public genetic association datasets. Adapting definitions from the World Health Organization, we excluded ICD-10 codes that represented communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions, injuries, or ill-defined diseases 60 14 7 We downloaded pre-computed genetic association testing results from FinnGen (Freeze 12) 61 62 63 64 All of Us 65 14 15 Features for gene-disease-specific models Descriptions of the 31 features we used for gene-disease-specific models are available in Supplementary Data 8 p 10 p 10 p For common variant associations from FinnGen, Million Veteran Program, and Pan-UK Biobank, we intersected variant-disease associations with significant eQTL associations from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (version 10). If a single variant had eQTLs corresponding to multiple genes, we kept the eQTL corresponding to the closest gene to the variant. We then grouped variants by whether the sign of the effect beta and the sign of the eQTL beta were the same (predicting an inhibitor mechanism) or opposite (predicting an activator mechanism), and retained the most significant association in each gene. We used a similar approach to incorporate Locus2gene evidence, but used eQTL associations provided by Open Targets, calculated a normalized harmonic sum of Locus2gene scores across all variants with the same predicted mechanism in each gene, and retained the larger sum. This yielded four common variant features (Supplementary Data 8 For rare coding variants from FinnGen and Genebass, as well as clinical variants from ClinVar, we first performed variant annotation using Ensembl variant effect predictor (VEP; release 112). For all stop-gained, splice site-disrupting, and frameshift variants, we then performed LOFTEE (version 1.0.4, GRCh38 branch) to classify these variants as either high-confidence or low-confidence LOF. For remaining missense variants, we classified them as LOF, GOF, or other using predictions from LoGoFunc, an ensemble model leveraging gene-, protein-, and variant-level features 19 44 65 66 8 beta 10 p For gene burden testing of rare and ultrarare coding variants, which we obtained from FinnGen, Genebass, and a meta-analysis by Jurgens et al., we created nine features (Supplementary Data 8 beta 10 p Statistical analyses We performed all analyses using Python 3.12. We evaluated model performance by aggregating holdout predictions across the eight outer folds from nested cross-validation and computing metrics over the entire dataset using scikit-learn. To estimate uncertainty, we calculated the mean and 95% confidence interval for each metric using 1000 iterations of the reverse percentile bootstrap. For models with multiple classes (e.g., activator, inhibitor, and other), we additionally calculated macro-averaged and micro-averaged metrics. Macro-averaging computes the metric independently for each class and then takes the average, treating all classes equally, whereas micro-averaging aggregates predictions across classes to compute an overall metric, giving more weight to classes with more samples. We performed statistical tests and calculated correlations using scipy (Python package version 1.14.1). All tests were two-sided, and we considered p Supplementary information  Supplementary information Supplementary data 1 Supplementary data 2 Supplementary data 3 Supplementary data 4 Supplementary data 5 Supplementary data 6 Supplementary data 7 Supplementary data 8 Supplementary data 9 Supplementary data 10 Supplementary data 11 Supplementary data 12 Supplementary data 13 Supplementary data 14 Supplementary data 15 Publisher’s note Supplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s44386-025-00027-0.
