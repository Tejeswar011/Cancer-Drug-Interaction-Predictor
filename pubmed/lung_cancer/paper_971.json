Celastrol (CLT), known for its antitumor, immunomodulatory, and osteogenic regulatory properties, has garnered substantial interest. Developing a targeted CLT delivery system is critical to enable precise drug release, integrate photothermal therapy, remodel the tumor microenvironment, and improve post-surgical treatment and repair in osteosarcoma. Methods Using emulsion-induced interface assembly, we synthesized mesoporous polydopamine-polyethylene glycol (MPDA-PEG) nanospheres and loaded them with celastrol to fabricate the targeted system MPDA-PEG-CLT. We characterized the nanospheres’ physicochemical properties and evaluated MPDA-PEG-CLT’s efficacy in synergistic drug-photothermal therapy for osteosarcoma through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results MPDA-PEG-CLT achieved a drug loading capacity of ~14% and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 37.6% under 808 nm NIR irradiation, which enhanced celastrol release. The system induced osteosarcoma cell apoptosis, promoted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) differentiation, and ameliorated the lesion microenvironment, resulting in efficient tumor ablation in mice. Conclusion MPDA-PEG-CLT significantly enhances celastrol’s targeted delivery efficiency, promotes mitochondrial apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells, synergizes with photothermal therapy to eradicate tumors, and improves the bone tissue microenvironment in lesions. This system offers a promising strategy for post-surgical osteosarcoma treatment and repair.

We characterized the photothermal efficiency, drug loading, and release kinetics of this nano-delivery system. The therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of MPDA-PEG-CLT were investigated using in vitro cell cultures and in vivo mouse models. Importantly, MPDA-PEG-CLT facilitates targeted delivery of CLT, thereby mitigating organ toxicity and overcoming osteosarcoma resistance to traditional chemotherapeutics.

ΔTmaxs indicates the temperature change of the solvent (eg, H 2 −2 CLT Load and Release Determination In order to load CLT into the mesoporous channel of MPDA-PEG, 10 mg of MPDA-PEG nanospheres with 3 mg of CLT were dispersed into 3 mL of acetone and stirred at room temperature, and after evaporation of two-thirds volume of acetone, CLT-loaded MPDA-PEG nanospheres (MPDA-PEG-CLT) were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water to remove surface-adsorbed CLT. To determine the drug loading capacity (DLC) versus encapsulation efficiency of MPDA-PEG-CLT, 100 μL of MPDA-PEG-CLT was eluted with 400 μL of distilled water and the eluate was passed through a Sephadex G50 column three times. The UV absorption value (m2) of CLT in MPDA-PEG was also measured at 425 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Then, 100 μL of MPDA-PEG-CLT was diluted with 400 μL of distilled water to directly determine the UV absorption value (m1) of total CLT, and the total amount of MPDA-PEG-CLT was m3. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading rate were calculated according to the following formula: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage[substack]{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage[mathscr]{eucal}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{linotext}{}\n\\DeclareFontShape{T1}{linotext}{m}{n} {linotext }{}\n\\DeclareSymbolFont{linotext}{T1}{linotext}{m}{n}\n\\DeclareSymbolFontAlphabet{\\mathLINOTEXT}{linotext}\n\\begin{document}$${\\mathrm{Encapsulation\\ efficiency}} = {{{\\mathrm{m}}1 - m2} \\over {{\\mathrm{m}}1}} \\times 100\\rm \\% $$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage[substack]{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage[mathscr]{eucal}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{linotext}{}\n\\DeclareFontShape{T1}{linotext}{m}{n} {linotext }{}\n\\DeclareSymbolFont{linotext}{T1}{linotext}{m}{n}\n\\DeclareSymbolFontAlphabet{\\mathLINOTEXT}{linotext}\n\\begin{document}$${\\mathrm{Drug\\ loading\\ rate}} = {{{\\mathrm{m}}1 - m2} \\over {{\\mathrm{m}}3}} \\times 100\\rm \\% $$\\end{document} To investigate the release properties of CLT, 5 mg MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres were dispersed in 5 mL PBS. Samples were then transferred to dialysis bags which were dialyzed against 20 mL PBS buffer and shaken in a dark environment. Every hour, 2 mL of the solution was withdrawn from the solution and supplemented with 2 mL of fresh PBS. All drug release results were averaged over triplicate measurements. To investigate the effect of NIR irradiation on drug release performance, MPDA-PEG-CLT (1 mg mL −1 In vitro Cell Viability Assay 143B cells (human osteosarcoma cell line) were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. MSCs (mouse bone marrow stromal cells) were cultured in MEM medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated in 96-well culture plates for 24 hours. Subsequently, cells were treated with different concentrations of MPDA-PEG nanoparticle dispersions and incubated for 24 hours. Finally, cell viability was determined using CCK-8 assay. Cellular Uptake Assay Cy5-modified MPDA-PEG nanospheres were prepared in cell uptake experiments by mixing 20 mg MPDA-PEG nanospheres with 5 mg CY5-amine in a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/PBS (v/v, 1/99) solution and magnetically agitated in the dark for 24 hours. The cellular uptake capacity of Cy5-modified MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres was determined by inverted fluorescence microscopy. 143B cells were cultured with MSCs cells in 24-well plates for 12 h and co-incubated with Cy5-modified MPDA-PEG nanospheres for 4 h. Cells were then stained with DAPI for 15 min before fluorescent images were taken using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Vitro PTT And Chemotherapeutic Assay 143B cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h before group treatment. For the MPDA-PEG + Laser and MPDA-PEG- CLT + Laser groups, 143B cells were treated with MPDA-PEG/MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres for 4 h and irradiated with a near-infrared laser (808 nm, 2Wcm −2 Live/Dead Cell Viability Assay 143B cells were cultured with MSCs cells in 24-well plates for 12 h, in which CLT, MPDA-PEG, and MPDA-PEG-CLT were added for 4 h, and then the MPDA-PEG + Laser and MPDA-PEG- CLT + Laser groups were irradiated for 5 min under 808 nm laser irradiation. Following this, cells were stained with calcein-am and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min. Images of cellular fluorescence were taken using an inverted fluorescence microscope. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Assays Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and co-incubated with CLT, MPDA-PEG, and MPDA-PEG-CLT for 4 h. Then the MPDA-PEG + Laser and MPDA-PEG- CLT + Laser groups were irradiated for 5 min under 808 nm laser irradiation and placed in a cell incubator for 24 h. Cells used for cell cycle analysis were digested with trypsin (Hyclone), washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4 ° C. Cells were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min, washed twice with cold PBS, and centrifuged. Cell cycle analysis was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after treatment with RNase A (0.1 mg/mL) and staining with propidium iodide (PI, 0.05 mg/mL; 4A Biotech Beijing, China) for 30 min at 37 ° C. For analysis of apoptosis, cells were trypsinized followed by two PBS washing steps. Cells were stained using Annexin V/PI assay kit (4A Biotech, Beijing, China) for 5 min at room temperature. Apoptotic cells were determined using a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Apoptosis Detection 143B cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 12 h, in which CLT, MPDA-PEG, and MPDA-PEG-CLT were added for co-incubation for 4 h, and then the MPDA-PEG + Laser and MPDA-PEG-CLT + Laser groups were irradiated for 5 min under 808 nm laser irradiation. Following this, they were placed in a cell incubator for an additional 12 hours. Then, the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis in each group were detected by mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis detection kit. Western Blotting Protein samples were extracted using cell lysis buffer (P0013, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) supplemented with proteinase (04693159001, Roche, Switzerland) and phosphatase inhibitors (4906837001, Roche). Then, 1/5 volume of loading buffer was added into the cell lysis at 100 °C for 10 min. Protein samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Blots were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 25 °C, then incubate the membrane with specific antibodies against Caspase 3(Affinity,1:1000, #AF7022), Caspase 9(Affinity,1:1000, #AF5240), Bax (Affinity,1:1000, #AF0120) and Bcl-2 (Affinity,1:1000, #AF6139) at 4 °C overnight. Blots were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bioss, 1:5000, #bs-0295G) for 2 h at 25 °C. Finally, each membrane was exposed to ECL (SQ202, Epizyme, Shanghai, China). Immunofluorescence Detection of Mitochondrial Apoptosis in Osteosarcoma Cells 143B cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 12 h, in which CLT, MPDA-PEG, and MPDA-PEG-CLT were added for co-incubation for 4 h, and then the MPDA-PEG + Laser and MPDA-PEG- CLT + Laser groups were irradiated for 5 min under 808 nm laser irradiation. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Following three additional PBS washes, 0.5% Triton X-100 (in PBS) was used for 20 min at room temperature. Goat serum was blocked for 30 minutes after three additional PBS washes and then incubated overnight at 4°C with Cytochrome C (HUABIO, 1:100, M1701-9) and Tomo20 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:100, 42406) antibodies. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor ® ® Extraction and Culture of Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Primary BMSCs were extracted and cultured as described 22 5 2 Osteoblast Differentiation Assays Alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and expression were examined for osteoblast differentiation and, in brief, BMSCs were replated overnight in 24-well plates. The following day, cells were treated with celastrol (0.4 μM) for three days. AP staining assay was performed using the BCIP/NBT alkaline phosphatase chromogen kit. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed to detect osteoblast marker gene expression. Mineralization Assay Bone nodule formation was tested as previously described. 23 Quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted following treatment of cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized from extracted total RNA by reverse transcription reaction kit instructions (TAKARA, Japan).

( A B C D E F G H I MPDA-PEG nanospheres with different diameters were then characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. The FT-IR spectrum is shown in Figure 1D −1 −1 24 Figure 1E −1 −1 −1 25 In order to enhance the stability and dispersibility of MPDA in physiological media and achieve the purpose of applying it to organisms in the future, MPDA was functionalized with PEG using NH2·PEG under alkaline conditions (pH 12.0) through Michael addition/Schiff base reaction. As shown in Figure 1F Figure 1G Figure 1H Figure 1I Photothermal Effect of MPDA-PEG In recent years, nanomaterials with high NIR absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency have been widely used in PTT. 26 Figure 1B Figure 1D E −1 −2 Figure 2A B Figure 2C 27 Figure 2 Determination of thermal conversion efficiency of MPDA nanoparticles. ( A B C D E F G In order to detect the excellent photothermal effect of MPDAPEG-190, the photothermal stability of MPDA-PEG nanospheres was first examined by repeated exposure to near-infrared laser irradiation (808 nm, 2 W cm −2 Figure 2D Figure 2E Tumor tissue is in an acidic microenvironment with excessive hydrogen peroxide, 28 2 2 29 2 2 Figure 2F G Celastrol Loading and Release Due to the poor water solubility of celastrol, significant organ toxicity with poor intestinal permeability, its application is limited. 6 30 31 Therefore, we investigated the celastrol loading capacity of MPDA-PEG-190 nanospheres. As shown in Figure 3A −1 −1 −1 Figure 3B C 2 −1 3 −1 2 −1 3 −1 Figure 3 Determination of Drug Loading and Biological Application of MPDA-PEG-CLT Nanoparticles. ( A B C D E F G H I J K L Next, we evaluated the release behavior of celastrol from MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres. The results showed that MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres released about 18% of celastrol within 24 hours ( Figure 3D −2 Figure 3D 32 The above results showed that MPDA-PEG-CLT exhibits NIR-responsive drug release behavior, and the increase in temperature could promote the release of chemotherapeutic drugs at the tumor site, increase the bioavailability of CLT, reduce side effects, and produce a synergistic therapeutic effect. 33 34 Extracorporeal Chemo-Photothermal Therapy Through previous studies, we found that MPDA-PEG nanospheres have excellent photothermal effect and excellent CLT loading and sustained release capabilities. Next, we further investigated its biological application value. First, the biocompatibility of MPDA-PEG and free CLT on 143B and BMSCs was determined by CCK-8 and live-dead staining assay. The results showed that cell viability decreased with increasing CLT concentration after incubation of 143B cells with different concentrations of CLT (0.1–10 μg mL −1 Figure 3E F −1 Figure 3G H −1 To further investigate the synergistic therapeutic effect of MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres with photothermal therapy, we incubated 143B cells using MPDA-PEG, free CLT, and MPDA-PEG-CLT, MPDA-PEG + 2 w cm −2 −2 Figure 3I −2 −2 In addition, the specific targeting of MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres to osteosarcoma is essential for in vivo and in vitro treatment. Folate receptors have been found to be overexpressed in most tumors 35 36–38 Figure 3J K 2 Figure 3L MPDA-PEG-CLT Leads to Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Osteosarcoma Cells Studies have shown that celastrol has good antitumor effects and inhibits the progression of a variety of tumors including glioma, leukemia, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. The specific mechanism are mainly manifested in the following aspects: it can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and enhance glycolysis, thereby inducing tumor cell death; it can regulate the metastasis of liver cancer cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Thr567 at the linker protein ezrin between the cytoskeleton and the cell membrane mediated by protein serine/threonine kinase (ROCK2); and it plays an anti-tumor role by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, NFκB signaling pathway], and MAPK signaling pathway. We found that MPDA-PEG-CLT could arrest the cell cycle of osteosarcoma cells in G2/S phase after incubation with osteosarcoma cells ( Figure 4A B Figure 4C D 39 Figure 4E Figure 4F Figure 4G Figure 4H Figure 4 Effect of different treatment groups on osteosarcoma cell function. ( A B C D p p p E F G H MPDA-PEG-CLT Promotes Osteogenic Differentiation of BMSCs Bone defects caused by osteosarcoma erosion and surgical intervention are inevitable, making it difficult for the body to complete self-repair, and bringing persistent severe pain and lifelong disability to patients. The commonly used clinical treatment is bone transplantation and inorganic material filling, but due to the limited source of bone graft and the insufficient biological activity of inert material, repair failure and revision problems exist for a long time, it is urgent to remodel the bone tissue microenvironment in the lesion area in order to promote bone repair after osteosarcoma surgery. Therefore, we preliminarily investigated the mechanisms involved in the regulation of developmental differentiation of BMSC by MPDA-PEG-CLT. It has been found that CLT has an inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation and adipogenesis in human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs). 40 41 8 Consistent with previous reports, MPDA-PEG-CLT promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, as shown by increasing osteoblast-specific alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity in BMSCs ( Figure 5A Figure 5B Figure 5C Figure 5 Effect of MPDA-PEG-CLT on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. ( A B C p p p In vivo Chemo-Photothermal Therapy Subsequently, we further investigated the photothermal effect of MPDA-PEG on tumor-bearing mice. First, we injected 143B tumor-bearing mice (n=3) with 100 μL of MPDA-PEG-CY5 dispersion (4 mg mL −1 Figure 6A −1 −2 Figure 6B Figure 6 In Vivo Therapeutic Efficacy Assessment of MPDA-PEG-CLT. Fluorescence in vivo imaging ( A B C D E F G We have previously demonstrated that MPDA-PEG-CLT has good antitumor effects in vitro, and next we evaluated osteosarcoma therapeutic effects in mice. When the tumor volume of 143B tumor-bearing nude mice reached 80 mm 3 Figure 6C −2 −2 Figure 6D In addition, no significant weight loss was observed in any of the mouse groups ( Figure 6E Figure 6F Figure 6G In summary, the MPDA-PEG delivery celastrol system prepared in this study has good safety and efficacy. In terms of drug loading capacity, MPDA achieves significantly higher drug loading (up to 15–20%) than liposomes, PLGA nanoparticles, or micelles by virtue of its mesoporous structure and π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions with Cel, overcoming the bottleneck that the latter is often limited by the loading capacity of the material itself (usually < 5%). 42 43 44 45 46 Conclusion In summary, our study developed an MPDA-PEG nanodelivery system loaded with celastrol, which has the potential to be a new chemotherapeutic drug, for the chemo-photothermal synergistic treatment of osteosarcoma. The results showed that the MPDA-PEG nanospheres had good photothermal effect and excellent celastrol loading capacity. In addition, we verified that MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres have better therapeutic effect on osteosarcoma by in vitro and in vivo experiments, with less side effects and better therapeutic effect than single drug therapy and PTT therapy. Finally, we found that MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres could promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro, which may provide ideas for the application of MPDA-PEG-CLT nanospheres in the repair of bone defects caused by osteosarcoma invasion. Our study demonstrated that MPDA-PEG nanospheres are expected to play an important role in the synergistic treatment of osteosarcoma and bone defect repair with traditional Chinese medicine components such as celastrol as novel chemotherapeutic drugs, and their good biocompatibility and degradability can reduce the adverse reactions of chemotherapeutic drugs in clinical treatment.
