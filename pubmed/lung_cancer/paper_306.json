With the progression of climate change, the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires have become a critical global issue due to their substantial impact on respiratory health. Wildfire smoke comprises elevated levels of ambient air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM 2.5 10 3 Wildfire Wildfire Smoke PM 2.5 Healthcare Utilization Respiratory Health Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Key Figure  Introduction In early January 2025, an outbreak of large-scale wildfires erupted across the greater Los Angeles area, exacerbated by atypically intense Santa Ana winds and long-standing drought conditions ( Figure 1 1 2 3 4 Santa Ana winds are intense, seasonally recurring winds that primarily develop from October to January, originating from inland high-pressure areas situated in Western Utah and Eastern Nevada and advancing toward the coastal areas of Southern California [ 5 6 7 8 9 Various climatic and meteorological factors have been identified as drivers of the exceptional severity observed in the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, encompassing the combined effects of strong seasonal wind activity and broader climate fluctuations. A key factor involves the interplay associated with the El Niño–La Niña transition. During the El Niño event of 2023 to 2024, there was an increase in rainfall that stimulated substantial vegetation growth throughout California, particularly in the southern part of the state, thereby increasing the biomass available for subsequent wildfire ignition [ 10 10 11 11 12 In 2022, South Korea witnessed a series of large-scale wildfires, with the eastern regions being most severely affected. A major wildfire that began in Uljin and spread to Samcheok caused widespread destruction of forest land, while concurrent fires in the Gangneung and Donghae regions led to a combined loss of 24,000 hectares, resulting in pronounced environmental and economic consequences [ 13 14 Figure 2 15 The Yeongdong region of Gangwon Province, the site of these fire events, is periodically influenced by a local atmospheric phenomenon called Yangganjipung—a hot and dry foehn wind that descends from the Taebaek Mountains during spring [ 16 Climate change is increasingly acknowledged as a key factor that exacerbates wildfire risk in South Korea. Over the last century, the country’s mean annual temperature has risen by roughly 1.6°C, with the most pronounced warming recorded during the spring season [ 17 18 19 20 Air Pollutants Released During Wildfires Wildfire smoke is comprised of a complex mixture of pollutants. The specific composition of air pollutants in wildfire smoke can vary considerably and is determined by several factors, such as the nature of the burned materials, meteorological conditions during the fire, and proximity to the source of ignition. Key air pollutants with significant health implications include PM (PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO 2 3 8 17 19 21 23 24 25 26 27 28 Inhalation and Physiological Responses to Wildfire-Related Pollutants When wildfire smoke is inhaled, fine and ultrafine PM, including PM2.5, can penetrate the lower airways and alveolar spaces, where these particles may initiate a complex series of inflammatory and immune-mediated responses [ 21 29 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Health Impacts of Short-Term Wildfire Smoke Exposure 1. Mortality: all-cause and respiratory disease mortality Exposure to wildfire smoke has been linked to higher mortality rates in the overall population. The PM from wildfires is finer and contains elevated concentrations of oxidative and proinflammatory substances compared to urban pollutants, which increases the risks of both respiratory and cardiovascular deaths. Multiple studies have demonstrated that exposure to wildfire smoke raises the risk of mortality from respiratory illnesses [ 8 27 39 44 24 45 46 3 40 47 2. Healthcare utilization: emergency department visits, physician visits, and hospital admissions 1) All-cause respiratory disease healthcare utilization Wildfires emit substantial amounts of air pollutants in a short period, often persisting for several weeks, which leads to elevated levels of PM and other hazardous components. These exposures play a role in triggering new cases as well as worsening acute exacerbation of respiratory diseases, thereby increasing demand for healthcare services. The impact is particularly pronounced among those with underlying health issues, driving up emergency department visits, outpatient care, and hospital admissions [ 8 24 27 39 45 Emergency department visits represent the most sensitive metric for assessing acute exacerbations of respiratory diseases linked to wildfire smoke exposure. Exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 has been correlated with an elevated risk of emergency department visits for respiratory conditions, especially in individuals with pre-existing asthma or COPD [ 24 46 48 57 58 24 25 54 59 62 2) Disease specific healthcare utilization (1) Asthma Asthma is the respiratory condition most acutely affected by wildfire smoke exposure. This heightened susceptibility is mainly attributed to the specific properties of wildfire smoke, which possesses a substantial fraction of ultrafine PM that can reach the distal airways [ 31 31 63 64 46 48 50 52 54 57 65 51 54 59 60 66 Table 1 63 67 (2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is a highly prevalent respiratory disorder that significantly increases healthcare utilization on a global scale. Exposure to wildfire smoke has been identified as a crucial environmental factor contributing to both the progression and exacerbation of COPD [ 68 37 43 59 60 64 66 49 52 55 69 58 Table 2 (3) Miscellaneous diseases: respiratory tract infectious disease (pneumonia) and interstitial lung disease Exposure to wildfire smoke can disrupt the regulation of the respiratory immune system, thereby increasing vulnerability to respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia [ 8 21 66 52 69 Health Impacts of Long-Term Wildfire Smoke Exposure Long-term exposure to wildfire smoke is recognized as a major environmental factor in the development and progression of respiratory diseases. While numerous studies have characterized the short-term effects of wildfire smoke, the evidence regarding its long-term health effects remains scarce. A natural experiment stemming from the 1997 Indonesian wildfires demonstrated that lung capacity was reduced even 10 years post-exposure, with the impact most pronounced among men and older adults, whereas children exhibited near-complete recovery. Despite confounding influences from age and socioeconomic status, air pollution was confirmed as a principal determinant in long-term lung function [ 70 Recently, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines adopted the classification framework introduced by the ‘Lancet Commission’ on COPD, which categorizes COPD into five etiological subtypes [ 71 72 72 68 Lung cancer development is heavily influenced by environmental pollutant exposure. In recent years, substantial attention has been directed toward the impacts of air pollution on both lung cancer incidence and mortality, with wildfire smoke recognized as a particularly important emerging factor. Several studies indicate that exposure to wildfire-derived PM2.5 may be associated with higher cancer mortality compared to general PM2.5, showing a notable relationship with lung cancer mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.011; 95% CI, 1.004 to 1.018) [ 73 74 75 Conclusion Climate change induced by global warming is causing significant harm to both ecosystems and public health. Through the expansion of arid areas and intensification of extreme wind conditions, global warming is closely linked to a higher frequency of large-scale wildfire. Such wildfires are likely to pose growing risks to public health, especially in terms of respiratory diseases. Wildfire smoke contains a complex mixture of hazardous air pollutants, with fine M (PM2.5) recognized as the most significant concern for respiratory health. Wildfire PM2.5 exhibits greater oxidative and proinflammatory properties compared to other sources, resulting in increased respiratory toxicity upon inhalation. Brief exposure is associated with acute worsening of respiratory illnesses such as asthma, COPD, and pneumonia, and is linked to higher rates of emergency department utilization and hospital admissions. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates long-term adverse effects, including the onset or advancement of COPD and lung cancer, highlighting the ongoing public health risks posed by wildfire smoke exposure. With wildfires becoming more frequent and severe, the responsibilities of healthcare professionals are expanding. Comprehensive, evidence-based insight into the impacts of wildfire smoke on different respiratory conditions is increasingly essential. Physicians should also take the initiative to educate and prepare at-risk patients for potential wildfire-related hazards. Additionally, significant gaps exist in the current literature regarding the impact of wildfire smoke on rare diseases such as ILD, despite the suspected elevated susceptibility among these groups. Thus, it is essential to conduct focused epidemiological investigations to elucidate the health outcomes associated with wildfire smoke exposure in individuals with ILD and other rare conditions. Improving knowledge of wildfire-related health effects will not only optimize clinical management but also support effective public health strategies and inform policy development in the context of climate change. Wildfires have become an immediate concern for all, necessitating urgent and collective action.  Authors’ Contributions Conceptualization: Gu KM, Myong JP. Methodology: all authors.
