Unfortunately, this process continues to be a challenging task. Several machine learning models have been generated to aid in simplifying and improving the prediction of candidate compounds. Models tuned for predicting kinase inhibitors have been established. However, an effective model can be limited by the size of the chosen training dataset. In this study, we tested several machine learning models to predict potential kinase inhibitors. A dataset was curated from a number of publicly available repositories. This resulted in a comprehensive dataset covering more than half of the human kinome. More than 2,000 kinase models were established using different model approaches. The performances of the models were compared, and the Keras-MLP model was determined to be the best-performing model. The model was then used to screen a chemical library for potential inhibitors targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB). Several PDGFRB candidates were selected, and in vitro 50 kinase small molecule machine learning artificial intelligence PDGFRB inhibitor pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
