Introduction Arthritis is a prevalent inflammatory disorder characterized by joint pain, swelling, and cartilage degradation, ultimately leading to impaired mobility and a decreased quality of life [ 1 2 Current treatments, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids, offer symptomatic relief but are associated with significant side effects and limited efficacy in halting disease progression [ 3 4 Merely eliminating inflammation is insufficient, as arthritis inevitably progresses to structural damage and functional impairment over time [ 5 4 5 Management of arthritis often necessitates the long-term use of disease-modifying agents such as methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, which require careful monitoring of infection risks, drug resistance, and systemic side effects associated with immunosuppressive therapies [ 6 Natural and synthetic small molecules with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have been extensively investigated as potential treatments for arthritis. Plant-derived compounds such as Punica granatum 7 8 Gaultheria procumbens 9 Centella asiatica 10 Camellia sinensis 11 12 ® 13 In this study, we formulated a new formula, AS632, by combining plant extracts, MSM, and Peptiskin ® ® ® 2. Results 2.1. Particle Sizes and Zeta Potentials of AS632 and AS633 The particle sizes and zeta potentials of AS632 and AS633 were measured to confirm their nanoscale formulation and colloidal stability. As shown in Table 1 2.2. Cytotoxicity Analysis of AS632 and AS633 To determine safe and effective working concentrations for AS632 and AS633, we evaluated the effects of a range of concentrations (100 µL/mL (1:10 dilution), 10 µL/mL (1:100 dilution), 1 µL/mL (1:1000 dilution), and 0.1 µL/mL (1:10,000 dilution)) on cell viability in three cell types: THP-1 macrophages, human chondrocytes, and keratinocytes. Our results showed that in THP-1-derived macrophages, higher concentrations (100 µL/mL and 10 µL/mL) of AS632 and AS633 significantly reduced cell viability, indicating cytotoxic effects, whereas 1 µL/mL and 0.1 µL/mL concentrations were well tolerated. In contrast, in chondrocytes C228/I2 and keratinocytes HaCaT, treatment with AS632 100 µL/mL and 10 µL/mL concentrations promoted cell proliferations. AS633 did not exhibit notable cytotoxicity in any of the tested cell types, but its effect on cell proliferation was also less pronounced compared to AS632. Based on these findings, 1 µL/mL concentration was selected for subsequent experiments, as it represented a consistent balance between safety and bioactivity across different cell types. These results also suggest a potential role for AS632 in enhancing wound healing and tissue regeneration, particularly in keratinocytes and chondrocytes ( Figure 1 2.3. Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects of AS632 in Macrophages To evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of AS632 and AS633, we assessed their ability to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production in LPS-stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages. ELISA analysis revealed that LPS stimulation significantly increased TNF-α and IL-1β secretion by more than 20-fold and 10-fold, respectively, compared to the untreated control. Treatment with AS632 or AS633 significantly reduced the levels of both cytokines, whereas control liposomes had no inhibitory effect ( Figure 2 p ® Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key mediators in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We next examined whether AS632 and AS633 modulate ROS generation. Following LPS stimulation, cells were treated with AS632, AS633, or control liposomes for 48 h. Flow cytometry showed that LPS significantly increased intracellular ROS levels, which were markedly reduced by both AS632 and AS633 ( Figure 3 Figure 3 We also investigated the effects of AS632 and AS633 on the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Real-time PCR demonstrated that the mRNA levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly downregulated by AS632 and AS633 treatment ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 2.4. Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects of AS632 in Keratinocytes To evaluate the effects of AS632 and AS633 on keratinocytes, HaCaT cells were stimulated with TNF-α and IFN-γ, followed by treatment with either AS632, AS633, or control liposomes. ELISA results showed that cytokine stimulation significantly increased the secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β, which was significantly inhibited by both AS632 and AS633 ( Figure 5 We further examined ROS levels in stimulated HaCaT cells. As shown in Figure 6 2.5. Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Effects of AS632 in Chondrocytes To assess the protective effects of AS632 and AS633 in chondrocytes, we pre-treated C28/I2 cells with either the compound or control liposomes for 2 h, followed by stimulation with IL-1β and TNF-α. Cell viability analysis showed that cytokine treatment significantly reduced cell viability, whereas AS632 and AS633 pre-treatment markedly preserved cell survival ( Figure 7 We then investigated the effects of AS632 and AS633 on inflammatory gene and protein expression in chondrocytes. Compared with the untreated control, IL-1β/TNF-α treatment significantly upregulated mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Pre-treatment with AS632 or AS633 significantly downregulated these genes ( Figure 8 14 Figure 8 Finally, ROS production in C28/I2 chondrocytes was assessed using DCFDA staining. Cytokine stimulation resulted in more than a 4-fold increase in total cellular ROS compared to the untreated control. However, AS632 and AS633 significantly inhibited this ROS elevation ( Figure 9 3. Discussion The natural ingredients incorporated into AS632 and AS633 were selected based on their complementary mechanisms targeting inflammation, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix degradation, all of which are central to arthritis pathophysiology. Punica granatum 7 8 Gaultheria procumbens 9 15 Centella asiatica 10 16 17 Camellia sinensis 11 The particle characterization results support the suitability of AS632 and AS633 for topical application. Both formulations exhibited nanoscale particle sizes, which are advantageous for enhanced skin penetration and cellular uptake [ 18 19 19 This study demonstrates that AS632 possesses significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties across multiple cell types relevant to arthritis pathogenesis. In macrophages, AS632 treatment effectively suppressed LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β secretion, indicating a strong inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory signaling pathways [ 20 21 Beyond its anti-inflammatory actions, AS632 showed robust antioxidant activity by reducing intracellular ROS levels in both macrophages and keratinocytes. Given that ROS play a central role in oxidative stress-mediated synovial damage and cartilage degradation [ 22 To better understand the cytocompatibility and potential proliferative effects of AS632 and AS633, we evaluated their cytotoxicity effects across a concentration range (0.1–100 µL/mL). At higher concentrations (10 and 100 µL/mL), both AS632 and AS633 induced cytotoxicity in THP-1 derived macrophages. However, only AS632 promoted significant cell proliferation in chondrocytes and keratinocytes, whereas AS633 showed no notable effects on cell viability or proliferation across the tested concentrations. These findings suggest that AS632 may offer dual therapeutic benefits—mitigating inflammation while simultaneously supporting tissue regeneration, particularly in skin and joint tissue. Based on its consistent safety and efficacy across cell types, the concentration of 1 µL/mL was selected for subsequent experiments. The enhanced biological effects observed with AS632, compared to AS633, are likely attributed to the inclusion of Peptiskin ® ® 23 24 25 26 27 28 Consistent with these effects, AS632 also significantly reduced the expression and enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in macrophages and MMP-3 and MMP-13 in chondrocytes—enzymes critically involved in cartilage degradation in arthritis joints [ 29 30 31 ® Additionally, AS632 demonstrated cytoprotective effects in chondrocytes exposed to IL-1β/TNF-α stimulation, as evidenced by improved cell viability and reduced expression of inflammatory mediators such as iNOS and MMP-3. These effects are particularly relevant to arthritis pathogenesis, where oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory signaling contribute to cartilage degeneration [ 32 33 Although AS632 and AS633 exhibited comparable performance in several assays—such as ROS suppression and general anti-inflammatory activity—AS632 consistently demonstrated superior efficacy in key functional parameters. This differential efficacy underscores the potential of Peptiskin ® ® ® Collectively, our results indicate that AS632 and AS633 may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for arthritis by simultaneously targeting inflammation, oxidative stress, and matrix degradation ( Figure 10 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Chemicals and Antibodies Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Cat. No. Ab120297 Ab113851 TM TM 4.2. Plant Extract Preparation All plant materials used in the formulation were sourced from GMP-certified industrial suppliers (Cosmax NBT, Seoul, Republic of Korea) using cultivated material. The plant origin and species authentication were verified by the supplier based on macroscopic and HPLC fingerprinting analysis. Although no voucher specimens were deposited in an academic herbarium due to industrial sourcing, botanical authentication records and quality certificates are maintained in the manufacturer’s in-house archives and can be made available upon request. Centella asiatica Camellia sinensis Gaultheria procumbens Punica granatum 4.3.

Active compounds from each extract or oil were confirmed using supplier-provided analytical certificates (HPLC for asiaticoside and catechins; GC for methyl salicylate; UV for total polyphenols). Due to proprietary formulation protocols, batch-specific quantitative validation was not performed beyond verification of active marker presence using chromatographic identity matching. 4.4. Particle Size and Zeta Potential Analysis The particle size and zeta potential of AS632 and AS633 were measured using an ELSZ-2000 Zeta-Potential & Particle Size Analyzer (Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan) based on laser light scattering. AS632 had an average particle size of 239 nm, and AS633 measured 226.7 nm. Both values fall within the optimal range (<400 nm) for efficient skin penetration. The zeta potentials were −46.3 mV for AS632 and −50.0 mV for AS633, indicating excellent colloidal stability (values greater than ±30 mV are considered stable). 4.5. Cell Culture and Treatment The test formulations were applied at a final concentration of 1 μL/mL (1:1000 dilution) unless otherwise stated. Ascorbic acid (2 μM) was used as a positive control for antioxidant assays (ROS inhibition), and dexamethasone (1 μM) was included in cytokine inhibition assays for comparison. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 (ATCC) was cultured in an RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.05 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 HaCaT keratinocytes (ATCC) and C28/I2 chondrocytes (Sigma-Aldrich) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. HaCaT cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α and 10 ng/mL IFN-γ for 24 h, followed by treatment with AS632, AS633, control liposomes, or positive controls for 48 h. C28/I2 cells were pre-treated with AS632, AS633, control liposomes, or positive controls for 2 h and then stimulated with 1 ng/mL IL-1β and 10 ng/mL TNF-α. Treatment duration was 48 h for cytotoxicity evaluation and 24 h for other assays. 4.6. Cytotoxicity Testing by MTT Assay THP-1-derived macrophages, HaCaT keratinocytes, and C28/I2 chondrocytes were seeded into 96-well plates at 2 × 10 4 4.7. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Supernatants were collected from treated cultures to quantify secreted IL-1β and TNF-α. For IL-1β, concentrations were measured using a commercial ELISA kit (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol, and absorbance was read at 450 nm. For TNF-α, supernatants were coated onto ELISA plates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), plates were incubated with a primary anti-TNF-α antibody for 4 h followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. 4.8. RNA Preparation and Real-Time Quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted using the easy-BLUE TM For cDNA synthesis, 2 µg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Hyperscript TM 4.9. Intracellular ROS Detection ROS generation was measured using the DCFDA Cellular ROS Detection Kit (Abcam). For flow cytometry, cells were seeded into 60 mm dishes, stained with 25 µM DCFDA for 45 min at 37 °C, washed, and analyzed using a Cytomics FC500 MLP cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). For microscopy, DCFDA-stained cells were counterstained with MitoTracker dye for 20 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, CKX53, Tokyo, Japan). 4.10. Western Blot Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and the protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein (20 µg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% BSA in TBST, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized using the ECL solution (GenDEPOT, Katy, TX, USA) and detected with a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad). 4.11. Zymography After treatment, the medium was collected and subjected to a gelatin zymography assay as described by the manufacturer’s direction (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, samples were mixed with equivalent amounts of sample buffer and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were separated on pre-casted acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with washing buffer at room temperature followed by incubation with a reaction buffer at 37 °C for 36 h. The gels were then incubated with staining solution for 30 min at room temperature, and gelatinase activity was determined as non-stained bands. 4.12. Statistical Analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate or more. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test (SPSS v12.0 for Windows). A p 5. Conclusions This study confirms the potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of AS632 and AS633 in in vitro models of arthritis. AS632 and AS633 significantly reduced the secretion of key pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β), intracellular ROS accumulation, and MMP expression. Furthermore, it protected chondrocytes from cytokine-induced cytotoxicity. These multifaceted actions suggest that AS632 and AS633 hold potential as a novel topical or systemic therapeutic agent for managing chronic inflammatory disorders such as arthritis.
