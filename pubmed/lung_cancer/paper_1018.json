Abstract Japanese encephalitis is a neuroinflammatory condition caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2) is a key modulator of glucose metabolism. The role of PKM2 in the autoimmune response and inflammation is now increasingly being acknowledged. However, its role in modulating virus replication has not been explored. In the current study, we have explored the role of PKM2 in JEV replication. Our results show that endogenous PKM2 expression is significantly upregulated in JEV-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, overexpression and knockdown studies substantiate the negative effect of PKM2 on JEV replication. Additionally, JEV infection induced signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation in the infected neuronal cells. Overexpression of PKM2 enhanced STAT3 activation, while its downregulation reduced STAT3 activation in the JEV-infected neuronal cells. The results suggested that the overexpression of PKM2 exhibited elevated levels of TNF- α β in silico in vitro α β Japanese encephalitis virus non-structural protein pathogenesis pyruvate kinase M2 replication http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001411 Indian Council of Medical Research NER/71/2020-ECD-I Kumar Sachin pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Importance Japanese encephalitis is a major threat to public health not only because it causes many deaths but also because of its permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae, such as seizures, paralysis, motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment in children. Out of all non-structural proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is highly immunogenic. A wide range of possible interactive partners has been identified for the NS1, many of which have been linked to immune evasion and regulating viral replication. In the current study, we have described a novel host cell factor, pyruvate kinase isoform M2, regulating JEV replication, perhaps by modulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF- α β Data Availability The datasets generated in the study are available upon appropriate request from the corresponding author. Introduction Japanese encephalitis is a serious vector-borne disease resulting in permanent neurological sequelae. The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the causative agent of Japanese encephalitis [ 1 2 Culex 3 JEV is classified as a member of the genus Orthoflavivirus Flaviviridae 2 4 5 6 9 NS1 protein is a highly conserved protein with a molecular weight ranging from 46 to 55 kDa, depending on the extent of glycosylation [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 RNA viruses have been shown to modulate key glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [ 18 22 23 24 d 25 19 21 β 21 26 27 28 31 PKM2 is a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, essential for tumour metabolism and development [ 32 33 34 α α β β 35 37 38 40 38 β α 41 β 42 α 43 44 45 47 PKM2 is one of the key glycolytic enzymes which performs several non-glycolytic tasks with far-reaching consequences, the extent of which has to be fully deciphered [ 48 49 50 51 51 52 53 54 The present study focuses on investigating the potential role of PKM2 in JEV replication. This was accomplished by examining the effects of overexpression of PKM2 and silencing of endogenous PKM2 on JEV replication in mouse neuroblastoma cells. In-silico in vitro Methods Cells and virus The mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a and the baby hamster kidney BHK-21 were obtained from the National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, India. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (GIBCO) cocktail at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2. The JEV strain SA14-14-2 (GenBank accession number JN604986 g Plasmids and antibodies The following plasmids were used in the current study: pEGFP-PKM2 (Addgene #64698) and pEGFP (Addgene #165830). The antibodies used are as follows: anti-NS1 (GeneTex, USA), anti-PKM2 (Cell Signaling Technology, USA), anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, USA), anti-GFP (Bio Bharati, India), goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, USA) and anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technology, USA) conjugated with HRP. Virus infection and quantification Neuro-2a cells were seeded in a six-well plate at a density of 0.6×10 6 −1 −1 2 Gene expression analysis using real-time PCR RNA lysate was prepared at different time points post-infection using RNAiso Plus reagent (TaKaRa, Japan). Total RNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform extraction method, and 1 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The quantitative real-time PCR was performed using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA). The fold change in mRNA level in infected versus mock-infected samples was calculated using the 2 (−ΔΔ Ct Immunoblotting Cells were lysed in RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer), and proteins were separated on 12% SDS gel. Separated proteins from the gel were transferred to a 0.4 µm nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk prepared in 1X TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline with Tween-20) for 2 h. Following blocking, primary antibody dilution was prepared in 2% BSA and incubated at 4 ˚C overnight. After incubation, the membrane was washed with PBS and thereafter incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and detected using ECL (Enhanced Chemiluminescence) reagent (BioRad, USA) under chemiluminescence. Quantitative analysis was performed for each biological replicate using ImageJ software. Overexpression and knockdown studies The plasmid used in this study, pEGFP-PKM2 (Catalogue No. #64698), was a generous gift from the Axel Ullrich lab [ 55 The knockdown of endogenous PKM2 was achieved by co-transfecting two siRNAs at a total concentration of 50 pmol. The following sense strand sequences of siRNA were used: GAUGUCGACCUUCGUGUAA[dT] and UCCUAUCAUUGCCGUGACU[dT][dT] [ 56 Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) cross-linking of PKM2 Neuro-2a cells were infected with JEV, and 48 h post-infection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times and treated with 500 µM of DSS crosslinker (Merck, Catalogue No. S1885) for 30 min at 37 ˚C. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by treating cells with 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) for 15 min. Cells were then lysed with RIPA buffer, followed by western blotting. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation The Neuro-2a cells were cultured in a six-well plate and infected with 0.1 m.o.i. JEV. At 48 h post-JEV infection, cells were collected and washed with PBS twice. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing PBS, 1 mM dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor cocktail (TaKaRa) and 1% NP 40 for 10 min at room temperature. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 g  Structure modelling of JEV NS1 and mouse PKM2 protein The amino acid sequences of JEV NS1 and mouse PKM2 proteins were retrieved from GenBank accession numbers QCZ42158 NP_001365797 57 59 60 Molecular docking study To study the possible interaction between the predicted structure of JEV NS1 and mouse PKM2 protein, molecular docking was performed using ClusPro 2.0 protein–protein docking software. ClusPro 2.0 generates multiple docking conformations (clusters) based on rigid-body docking, followed by energy-based filtering and clustering to identify the most probable binding models [ 61 62 63 64 65 66 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations To study the conformational stability, the docked protein–protein complex was subjected to all-atom MD simulations using the GROMACS v2020.1 software [ 67 68 + − time step electrostatic interactions van der Waals interactions Immunofluorescence Neuro-2a cells were cultured on coverslips and subsequently transfected with pEGFP-PKM2. The cells were infected with JEV 24 h post-transfection, and 48 h post-infection, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed with PBS at least three times and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Subsequently, the fixed cells were rinsed using 1X PBS and then incubated in a blocking buffer (5% BSA). For JEV protein detection, cells were incubated with a 1/100 dilution of mouse mAb against NS1 (GeneTex, USA), followed by incubation with a 1/500 dilution of goat Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, USA) anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. After the final wash with PBS, cells were stained with DAPI, and slides were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and examined under a 63X objective using the confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880, Germany). Co-IP assay Capturem Co-IP kit was procured from TaKaRa (Japan). The Neuro-2a cells were transfected with pEGFP-PKM2, and the cells were infected with JEV 24 h post-transfection. Infected cells were harvested and lysed after 48 h in the 200 µl lysis buffer per 1×10 6 g g g Statistical analysis All the data were statistically validated using GraphPad Prism software, and results were shown as mean± sd P P P P Results JEV infection induces upregulation of PKM2 expression in Neuro-2a cells The expression of PKM2 was investigated in Neuro-2a cells following JEV infection with different m.o.i.

The results revealed enhanced endogenous PKM2 expression in infected cells. Studies performed on other RNA viruses, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, have also shown higher expression of PKM2 in infected cells [ 50 53 74 75 PKM2 exists in two functional states: the active tetrameric state and the inactive dimeric state [ 76 72 77 79 80 81 82 83 84 82 Several studies have linked PKM2 with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [ 42,85 87 α β 88 89 92 α β α 93 PKM2 is a sticky protein and is known to interact with several host and viral proteins.

Beyond its well-known function in metabolism, PKM2 also influences key cellular processes such as cell-cycle regulation, cell migration, apoptosis and autophagy [ 116 119 in vivo Supplementary material 10.1099/jgv.0.002140 Uncited Supplementary Material 1.
