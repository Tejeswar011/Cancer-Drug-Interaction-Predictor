Abstract The effectiveness of T cell–based immunotherapy depends on durable T-cell responses that can efficiently eliminate tumor cells. NKG7 was discovered three decades ago as a protein associated with lytic granules. However, only studies published over the past 5 years have contributed substantially to our understanding of NKG7 in T-cell biology. NKG7 has been recognized as an important T-cell functional marker in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and in the prognosis of certain cancers. Besides its role in the generation, trafficking, and release of lytic granules, which is critical for efficient T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells, NKG7 has been identified as a key negative regulator of mTORC1 activity. By restraining mTORC1 activity, NKG7 promotes T-cell longevity and memory generation after infection. Importantly, NKG7 upregulation has demonstrated therapeutic potential in preclinical T-cell therapy for cancer. Collectively, NKG7 is emerging as a promising biomarker and therapeutic addition to T cell–based immunotherapies.

Recent studies have revealed a key role for NKG7 in lysosome homeostasis and regulation of mTORC1 through its antagonism of v-ATPase assembly. NKG7, as a novel cell type–specific negative regulator of mTORC1, is required to preserve the longevity and resiliency of effector and memory T cells. The dual role of NKG7 in T-cell cytotoxicity and longevity positions NKG7 as a functional marker for T cells in tumor tissues and peripheral blood, which could be used in correlative studies aimed at understanding responses to immunotherapy and cancer prognosis. Leveraging the dual role of NKG7 in T-cell biology, it is highly likely that manipulating CD8 + ex vivo in vivo 1 + Acknowledgments We appreciate and recognize the contributions of other studies in the research field of NKG7; however, due to space constraints, we could not cite all of them in this brief review article.
