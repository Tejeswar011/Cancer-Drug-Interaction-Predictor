The aim of our research was to explore miR-335-5p in predicting elevated COPD susceptibility and in human bronchial epithelial cells injury. Patients and Methods qRT-PCR was performed to examine miR-335-5p levels in serum and cells. ROC curve and logistic regression analyses were utilized to evaluate the predictive capacity of miR-335-5p for COPD susceptibility. Pearson correlation was used to assess the association of miR-335-5p with TNF-α, IL-6, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC. Human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) conditions to simulate cell injury. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory response and oxidative stress-related factors were assayed by CCK8, flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Results miR-335-5p is reduced on COPD patients. ROC curve recommended that miR-335-5p has high sensitivity (88.9%) and specificity (80.0%) to distinguish COPD from healthy individuals. Logistic regression showed that reduced miR-335-5p predicted elevated COPD susceptibility. Moreover, miR-335-5p was significantly negatively related to TNF-α and IL-6 and positively related to FEV1, and FEV1/FVC in COPD patients. Cellular experiments revealed that CSE treatment decreased miR-335-5p expression, repressed cell proliferation, facilitated apoptosis, raised TNF-α, IL-6, ROS, and MDA levels, and reduced SOD levels. miR-335-5p overexpression facilitated cell proliferation, suppressed apoptosis, diminished TNF-α, IL-6, ROS, and MDA levels, and elevated SOD levels, whereas knockdown of miR-335-5p reversed this trend. Conclusion Downregulation of miR-335-5p increased COPD susceptibility and negatively correlated with inflammatory factors. Overexpression of miR-335-5p alleviated CSE-induced injury to human bronchial epithelial cells, which suggested that miR-335-5p may be a potential target for COPD treatment.

Firstly, bronchial epithelial cells are the primary target of exposure to external stimuli such as cigarette smoke and air pollutants, and they are the pathological starting point for lung diseases such as COPD. Secondly, the abnormal function of bronchial epithelial cells is the core factor for respiratory symptoms such as coughing and excessive phlegm in patients with COPD. In addition, in vitro bronchial epithelial cell models can accurately simulate disease microenvironments such as CSE-induced injury, facilitating quantitative analysis of miRNA-regulated molecular mechanisms by cell transfection. For our study, we evaluated the impact of miR-335-5p on COPD susceptibility by measuring its expression in COPD patients. The association of miR-335-5p with inflammatory factors in COPD patients was analyzed to explore whether miR-335-5p dysregulation affects COPD progression by influencing the inflammatory process. Furthermore, the function of miR-335-5p on human bronchial epithelial cells was experimentally verified to analyze the role it plays in cell injury. This research may provide direction in searching for new biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for COPD. Materials and Methods Participants The study retrospectively included COPD patients recruited at the Respiratory Medicine Outpatient Clinic of Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University from March 2019 to May 2022. The COPD patients were screened strictly based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and 117 patients were set up as COPD group. And in our hospital’s physical examination center, 100 cases of healthy individuals were chosen as healthy group. Inclusion criteria for the COPD group were a forced expiratory volume in first second/ forced vital capacity (FEV 1 This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The research was approved by the Clinical Ethics Committee of Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, and all participants signed an informed consent. Collection of Blood Samples and Data The COPD and healthy group collected 5 mL venous blood samples after fasting for 8 h and placed them in serum tubes. Centrifuge at 4000 rpm/min for 5 min at 4°C within 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was gathered into new centrifuge tubes and numbered accordingly, as well as the serum samples were subsequently saved at −80°C for spare use. Basic information including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, and pulmonary function test data (FEV 1 1 Extraction of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Venous blood was collected into anticoagulant tubes containing heparin sodium, and the blood samples were mixed and diluted with an equal volume of PBS. Then, it was slowly added to the Ficoll-Hypaque separation (Cytiva, USA) to avoid interfacial mixing. It was centrifuged at 550 g for 30 min at room temperature and the greyish-white peripheral blood mononuclear cells layer was aspirated using a pasteurized tube. PBS was added and centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min, supernatant was removed, and the precipitate was used for subsequent experiments. Preparation of Cigarette Smoke Extract (CSE) A three-way tube was connected to 1 lit cigarette and a syringe, and the aspirated smoke was dissolved in the pre-prepared DMEM medium (Gibco, USA). The medium is rapidly filtered through a filter with a 0.22 μm membrane to remove large particles and bacteria. The OD value of the extract was determined by a multifunctional enzyme marker, and the CSE obtained at an OD value of 0.25 at 405 nm was defined as 100% CSE stock solution. The CSE stock solution was readjusted to pH 7.40, and stored at 4°C for set aside. A pre-experiment was conducted on the treatment concentration and time of CSE. Cell viability gradually decreased with increasing CSE concentration. Further analysis of cell viability under 20% CSE showed that the cells were still proliferating at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. It indicated that 20% CSE can be used to construct a COPD model of cells ( Supplemental Figure 1A B Cell Culture and Transfection The human normal bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B), purchased from Pricella (Wuhan, China) and cultivated at 37°C under 5% CO 2 24 h before transfection, 1×10 5 RT-qPCR The required reagents including Trizol (Ambion, USA), chloroform, isopropanol, and 75% ethanol were pre-cooled in 4°C for extraction of total RNA from serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and BEAS-2B cells. RNA concentration was measured using a Nano Drop 2000 (Thermo, USA). Reverse transcription was performed according to the purchased PrimeScript RT Kit (Takara, Japan) and instructions. The reaction system is prepared according to the requirements, and the PCR reaction is set up on the machine. The 2 −ΔΔCt Cell Proliferation Assay Cell proliferation was assayed by CCK8 (Dojindo, Japan). Cells in logarithmic growth phase with good status were taken from each group, inoculated in 96-well plates, and cultivated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 Cell Apoptosis Assay Apoptosis was assayed by Annexin V-FITC/PI assay. Cells were gathered from each group and cleaned once by PBS, then added appropriate amount of tryptic digestive enzyme and incubated at room temperature. Added complete culture medium to cells and removed them to a new centrifuge tube, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm/min for 5 min and discarded the supernatant. Cells were resuspended in PBS, centrifuged again, discarding discarded, and resuspended with 500 μL binding buffer. Finally, 5 μL Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining solution were added and incubated for 20 min away from light. Results were analyzed using Flowjo software. Determination of TNF-α and IL-6 and Oxidative Stress Indicators Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adopted to assay TNF-α and IL-6 levels. The cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm/min for 10 min to extract impurities and debris, and the supernatant was extracted. The assay was carried out based on instructions of the TNF-alpha ELISA Kit, Human (Sino Biological, China) and IL-6 ELISA Kit, Human (Sino Biological, China). The levels of oxidative stress indicators ROS, MDA and SOD were detected using kits (Beyotime, China).

RT-qPCR revealed that transfection of miR-335-5p mimic elevated miR-335-5p levels, while transfection of miR-335-5p inhibitor decreased miR-335-5p levels ( Figure 3A Figure 3B supplemental Figure 1C Figure 3 Effect of overexpression or knockdown of miR-335-5p on CSE-induced cellular injury. ( A B C D E F G I P Cell proliferation assays showed that CSE treatment markedly reduced the proliferative capacity of BEAS-2B cells. Compared to CSE treatment, miR-335-5p upregulation led to enhanced cell proliferation, whereas miR-335-5p downregulation decreased cell proliferation ( Figure 3C Figure 3D Figure 3E F Figure 3G–I Discussion In this study, we found that miR-335-5p was down-regulated in COPD. It was positively correlated with FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, and negatively correlated with IL-6 and TNF-α. CSE treatment of BEAS-2B cells resulted in decreased miR-335-5p levels, inhibited cell proliferation and SOD production, and elevated apoptosis, IL-6, TNF-α, ROS and MDA levels, while overexpression of miR-335-5p reversed this trend. These findings suggested that miR-335-5p up-regulation reduces COPD susceptibility and may serve as a potential target for COPD therapy. With the rapid development of high-throughput technologies, multiple miRNAs have been found to be expressed differently between COPD patients and healthy individuals, thereby affecting the disease process. 19 20 21 Rb1, CARF SGK3 16 The progression of COPD is closely related to abnormal inflammatory regulation, immune imbalance and oxidative stress. 22 23 κ 24 25 26 BEAS-2B is an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line with the functions and characteristics of normal human bronchial epithelial cells. 27 28 29 In addition, several studies have analyzed the mechanism and regulatory network of miRNAs in COPD. For example, Wu et al reported that miR-125a-5p drove lung epithelial cell senescence through inhibition of the Sp1/SIRT1 axis, increased HIF-1α acetylation, and thus promoted COPD progression. 30 31 32 Nevertheless, there are several limitations of the study. The sample size included in this study was small and concentrated in a single regional population, which may affect the universality of the conclusion. In the future, the sample size needs to be expanded to verify the predictive efficacy of miR-335-5p through multi-center. A knockout animal model of miR-335-5p is lacking to validate its dynamic role in COPD development. Subsequent studies are needed to construct an animal model of lung tissue-specific miR-335-5p knockout to clarify its role in different pathological stages of COPD. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanism by which miR-335-5p functions in COPD needs to be further explored. Conclusion In conclusion, reduced miR-335-5p promoted elevated COPD susceptibility and may be a biomarker for COPD diagnosis. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-335-5p alleviated CSE-induced cell injury, which indicated that miR-335-5p might be a potential therapeutic target for COPD.
