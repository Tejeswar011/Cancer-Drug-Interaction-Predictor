Observational studies have shown that platelet indices are related to liver cancer. However, the specific relationship between the two is still inconclusive. We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal relationship between platelet indices and liver cancer. Methods We identified 2 cancer outcomes (liver cell carcinoma, malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile ducts) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the main method. In order to evaluate the potential horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses were examined via MR-Egger regression, heterogeneity test, pleiotropy test. Results Two-Sample MR analysis showed there were causal relationships between platelet indices and liver cancer. The mean platelet volume was positively associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, while platelet count was inversely correlated with HCC risk, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule levels were significantly related to an increased malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile ducts risk. In addition, we conducted reverse MR analyses and found that malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile ducts was positively associated with platelet count and platelet crit, but negatively correlated with platelet distribution width. Following multivariable mendelian randomization adjustments for potential confounding variables, the independent effects of platelet indices on HCC were not statistically significant. Conclusions The bidirectional causal relationship between platelet indices and liver cancer may be mediated by confounding factors such as liver cirrhosis. Further validation through mediation MR analyses or larger-scale replication studies is required to elucidate these causal pathways.

We used bidirectional MR analysis to detect the causal relationship between platelet indices and liver cancer risk. Methods Study design and data sources We conducted a bidirectional two-sample MR analysis to investigate the causal relationship between platelet indices and liver cancer. For the primary MR analysis, we evaluated the causal effects of five platelet parameters on liver cancer risk. Concurrently, a reverse-direction MR analysis was performed to examine the causal effects of liver cancer on these platelet indices. The process of MR is shown in Fig. 1 S1  Fig. 1 The main design of MR in this study Genetic instrument selection In MR, genetic variants are used as IVs to assess the causal effect of exposure on outcome. The basic conditions for genetic variants satisfying IVs are summarized as follows: (1) variants are associated with exposure; (2) variants are independent of outcome given the exposure and all the confounders; (3) variants can only affect outcomes through exposure. To satisfy the three core assumptions, we implemented rigorous IV selection criteria as follows: (1) SNPS with strong associations with exposure factors were selected, that is, the extracted SNPS should be below the genome-wide significance threshold ( P − 8 2 MR statistical analysis Two-sample MR was performed using genetic data extracted from GWAS. We used the two-sample MR package in R (version 4.2.3) to consolidate and analyze the data. To determine whether platelet indices might be a risk factor for liver cancer, we first treated platelet indices as the exposure and liver cancer as the outcome. As exploring the effect of liver cancer on platelet indices, in the reverse MR analysis process, liver cancer was used as the exposure and platelet indices as the outcome. In this study, IVW was the main method adopted in the statistical analysis and used to calculate the combined effect of all SNPs. For traits containing only one IV, the Wald ratio test was used to estimate the association between platelet indices and liver cancer. MR-Egger and weighted-median methods were used as supplements to the IVW method. Horizontal pleiotropy was examined using MR-Egger. Cochran’s Q test was conducted to evaluate the heterogeneity, if the P-value was greater than 0.05, it was considered that there was no heterogeneity in the included instrumental variables and that heterogeneity had a negligible effect on the causal effect estimates. In the visualization section, funnel plots were used to evaluate possible directional pleiotropy, leave-one-out analysis was utilized to investigate the heterogeneity of the MR, and forest plots were used to show the results for each SNP and the final MR. Results IVs selection Five indices including mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet count, PECAM levels, platelet crit (PCT), and platelet distribution width (PDW), were analyzed by dual-sample bidirectional MR.

It demonstrated that genetically predicted MPV, platelet count, and levels of PECAM are associated with liver cancer risk, providing novel research direction for the clinical prevention and treatment of liver cancer. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is ubiquitously expressed on platelets, endothelial cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. This multifunctional molecule regulates diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and immunological reaction [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 As a biomarker of platelet activation [ 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 38 To date, numerous studies have investigated the relationship between platelet count and HCC, yet the conclusions remain divergent. One study reported that low platelet count serves as an independent risk factor for HCC development [ 39 40 41 42 43 44 Our data analysis also showed that liver and intrahepatic bile duct malignancies were positively correlated with platelet count and PCT, but negatively correlated with PDW. HCC is frequently associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, including hypercholesterolemia, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, and erythrocytosis. Notably, thrombocytosis is observed in pediatric hepatoblastoma, though its prevalence in HCC remains less defined [ 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 This study has several limitations. Firstly, as our data were exclusively derived from European populations, the findings cannot be generalized to other ethnic groups, which restricts the external validity of the results. Secondly, although MVMR adjustment was performed for confounders such as PBC and T2DM, the possibility of residual confounding by potential unmeasured factors (e.g., viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) impacting causal inferences cannot be ruled out. Finally, the reverse MR analysis utilized a limited number of SNPs, making it prone to pleiotropy and other biases, thereby compromising the reliability of the causal inferences. While we observed a genetic-level association between platelet indices and liver cancer, future MR studies with larger sample sizes and randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate the complex bidirectional interactions between platelets and liver cancer pathogenesis. Conclusions In summary, these MR analyses suggest a bidirectional causal relationship between platelet indices and liver cancer, but the presence of confounding factors or intermediary effects cannot be excluded. The role of platelet indices as prevention strategy and therapeutic biomarkers for liver cancer requires further research validation.
