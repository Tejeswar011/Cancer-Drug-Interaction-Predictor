Methods The identified DEGs were subjected to functional enrichment analysis. PPI networks were predicted using the STRING database and visualized with Cytoscape. Hub genes were subsequently screened from the PPI network to construct a transcription TF-miRNA regulatory network. Subsequent analyses included: survival analysis, immune infiltration assessment and comprehensive mutational profiling. Results Among the 56 identified DEGs, 19 were upregulated while 37 were downregulated. GOntology enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment in immune response, signaling receptor binding, and extracellular region. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated predominant involvement in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway. Through Cytoscape-based screening, we identified 10 hub genes: CD19, CD27, IL7R, SELL, CCL5, CCR5, PRF1, GZMK, GZMA, and TIGIT. The TF-miRNA regulatory network analysis uncovered 6 transcription factors (STAT5A/B, NFKB1, EGR1, RELA, and CTCF) and 4 miRNAs(hsa-miR-204, hsa-miR-148b, hsa-miR-618, and hsa-miR-103) as critical transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of DEGs.Integrated analyses including Kaplan-Meier survival curves, immune infiltration profiling, and comprehensive mutational analysis demonstrated significant associations with brain metastatic progression in the studied cohort.

It represents the most frequent primary tumor type that metastasizes to the brain, followed by breast cancer and melanoma ( Cagney et al., 2017 Sung et al., 2021 Jonna and Subramaniam, 2019 Waqar et al., 2018 Page et al., 2020 Matsui et al., 2022 Cheng and Perez-Soler, 2018 Waqar et al., 2018 Nayak et al., 2012 Hubbs et al., 2010 Yang et al., 2019 Gillespie et al., 2023 Ali et al., 2013 Sperduto et al., 2020 Sperduto et al., 2017 Sperduto et al., 2017 Srinivasan et al., 2021 Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Schematic illustration of brain metastasis in NSCLC and the workflow of bioinformatic analysis.

PPI network construction and hub gene selection We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using the STRING database based on the 50 overlapping DEGs and visualized it with Cytoscape to identify highly interconnected hub proteins (hub-DEGs). The PPI network contained 64 nodes and 174 edges ( Figure 5A Figure 5B FIGURE 5 Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network visualized using Cytoscape software.

The x-axis lists proteins: CD19, CD27, IL7R, SELL, CCL5, CCR5, PRF1, GZMK, GZMA, TIGIT. The y-axis ranges from 2.5 to 3.5. TF regulatory network analysis of ten genes We established an integrated TF-mRNA-miRNA regulatory network comprising 10 hub genes, 43 transcription factors (TFs), and 63 miRNAs ( Figure 7 FIGURE 7 The TF-mRNA -miRNA regulatory network.

Nodes represent different molecules such as genes (red circles), microRNAs (green triangles), and transcription factors (blue squares). Lines denote interactions between them, with arrows indicating directionality. Varying node sizes and line thicknesses suggest differing interaction strengths or importance between elements in the networks. Survival impact of hub genes in brain metastasis To investigate the prognostic significance of the ten hub genes in patients with brain metastasis (BM), we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis stratified by median gene expression levels (high vs. low expression groups). The results ( Figure 8 Szczepanik et al., 2019 Supplementary Figure S1 FIGURE 8 Overall survival analysis of 10 hub DEGs in kmplot website. Three Kaplan-Meier survival curves compare low and high gene expression groups for IL7R, PRF1, and CCL5. The x-axis represents time in months, and the y-axis shows probability. IL7R and PRF1 show significant differences between high and low expression, with hazard ratios of 0.77 and 0.87, respectively, and low p-values. CCL5 shows no significant difference, with a hazard ratio close to one and a high p-value. The number at risk decreases over time for each gene. Immune cell infiltration analysis To elucidate the relationship between the 10 hub genes and immune cell activity, we performed tumor-infiltrating immune cell (TIIC) profiling. Compositional analysis revealed significant positive correlations between the expression of hub genes (IL7R,PRF1, etc.) and activated immune subsets, including: Memory B cells, Activated CD4+T cells (correlation with IL7R:r = 0.409), CD8+T cells, Notably,IL7R exhibited the strongest associations: B cell activity (r = 0.374, Figure 9 Supplementary Figure S2 FIGURE 9 The correlation of IL7R with tumor purity and immune cells in the immune system shows the purity-corrected partial Spearman’s rho value and statistical significance. Log2 (TPM) is the log2 of the Transcript Count Per Million. Scatter plots show the relationship between IL7R expression levels (log2 TPM) and infiltration levels for various immune cell types in LUAD and LUSC cancer types. The plots show correlations or partial correlations with p-values marked in red. Each subplot features a blue trend line with a shaded confidence interval, indicating specific correlations for Purity, B Cell, CD8+ T Cell, CD4+ T Cell, Macrophage, Neutrophil, and Dendritic Cell across two rows, each representing different cancer types. Mutation analysis of 10 crucial genes We examined the mutation frequency and mutation types of these 10 hub genes in the GSCA database. The results revealed that IL7R exhibited the highest mutation frequency, followed by PRF1, with missense mutations accounting for 39% and 13% of the alterations in these genes, respectively. Additionally, copy number variation (CNV) analysis demonstrated that IL7R had the highest Figure 10 Chaudhry et al., 2016 FIGURE 10 Variant frequency and mutation type of 10 genes in LUAD and LUSC.

Discussion The identification of biomarkers associated with lung cancer brain metastasis may provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression. This study aimed to analyze NSCLC gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), elucidate key molecular pathways, determine critical hub proteins, and characterize relevant regulatory biomolecules through a multi-omics data integration framework, with the ultimate goal of discovering potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC. Our gene expression profiling identified 56 DEGs, including 19 upregulated and 37 downregulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs were significantly associated with several oncogenic molecular functions and pathways. GSEA results demonstrated marked upregulation of the “interleukin-17 signaling pathway.” Notably, the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway has been previously established to contribute to the progression of lung cancer bone metastasis ( Zhou et al., 2023 Cheng et al., 2016 Zhao et al., 2019 Sevimoglu and Arga, 2014 Sevimoglu and Arga, 2014 Suarez-Carmona et al., 2019 Schlechter and Stebbing, 2024 Pages et al., 2005 Yu et al., 2024 Guan et al., 2024 Tibbs and Cao, 2022 Paczek et al., 2022 Park et al., 2021 Lavergne et al., 2021 Shaw et al., 2022 Erdogan et al., 2022 Zhang et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2023 Chu et al., 2018 Luo et al., 2015 Radanova et al., 2021 Li et al., 2021 Chen et al., 2004 Kim et al., 2013 Guan et al., 2024 Conclusion This study employed bioinformatics approaches to compare non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastasis (NSCLC-BM) samples, leading to the preliminary identification of 56 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) potentially associated with metastatic progression. These genes were significantly enriched in key pathways including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, viral protein-cytokine receptor interaction, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Among them, ten genes—CD19, CD27, IL7R, SELL, CCL5, CCR5, PRF1, GZMK, GZMA, and TIGIT—were selected as potential hub genes. Furthermore, predictions suggested that miRNAs such as hsa-miR-204 and hsa-miR-148b, along with certain transcription factors, may contribute to metastasis by modulating the tumor immune microenvironment. It is important to emphasize that the findings of this study are computational predictions, and all identified genes and regulatory molecules remain candidate biomarkers that have not been experimentally validated. None of the conclusions presented should be interpreted as established biomarkers or clinically applicable outcomes. These predictions require further experimental validation—including qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, independent patient cohort analyses, and in vitro in vivo Methods Microarray data The GSE161116 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GPL19965 Song et al., 2021 Stelzer et al., 2016 Data processing Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between primary NSCLC and NSCLC-BM were identified using the limma package ( Suzuki et al., 2019 GSE161116 GSE161116 Zeng et al., 2022 DEG enrichment analysis Functional enrichment analysis was performed using:Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with the MSigDB Collections ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp Zeng et al., 2022 http://david.ncifcrf.gov PPI network construction and hub gene identification Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were built using STRING (v10.0; http://string-db.org Hub gene-TF-miRNA regulatory network A mRNA-TF-miRNA co-regulatory network was constructed using NetworkAnalyst ( Xia et al., 2015 Survival analysis The Kaplan-Meier Plotter ( http://kmplot.com/analysis/ Tang et al., 2019 Immune infiltration analysis The TIMER 2.0 platform ( https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/ Mutation analysis Genomic alterations (mutations and copy number variations, CNVs) in hub genes were analyzed via GSCA ( http://gsca.bio-data.cn Statistical analysis To account for multiple hypothesis testing in the identification of differentially expressed genes, the false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.
