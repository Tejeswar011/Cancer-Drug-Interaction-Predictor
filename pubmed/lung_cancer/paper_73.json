Osteosarcoma is a common malignant bone tumor, characterized by its high invasiveness and propensity for lung metastasis. Despite advances in treatment, clinical outcomes remain poor, and patient prognosis is still unsatisfactory. Therefore, the development of more effective therapies is urgently needed. Here, we demonstrate that differential expression of GBP1 significantly influences PD-L1 expression and mediates immune escape in osteosarcoma. Specifically, our results reveal that GBP1 regulates PD-L1 expression by activating CDK9 and promoting STAT3 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that targeting GBP1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteosarcoma by impairing tumor immune evasion. keywords Osteosarcoma Immune escape Cancer immunotherapy PD-L1 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent primary bone malignancy, marked by high local invasiveness and propensity for lung metastasis. Despite progress in neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical interventions, the five-year survival rate for OS patients remains approximately 70 %. However, for patients exhibiting poor chemotherapy response, survival rates drop to around 30 % [ 1 2 3 4 [5] [6] [7] [8] Guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1), an interferon-stimulated gene induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), has been implicated in tumor progression and treatment resistance in various cancers, including ovarian and head and neck cancers [ 9 10 11 Materials and methods Cell culture MNNG/HOS and U-2 OS cell lines were obtained from Wuhan Pricella Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. MNNG/HOS cells were cultured in DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). U-2 OS cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium with 10 % FBS and 1 % P/S (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). All cultures were maintained in a 5 % CO₂ humidified incubator at 37°C. Chemical agents, siRNAs, and plasmids The STAT3 inhibitor STAT3-IN-13 (HY-150603) and the CDK9 inhibitor LDC000067 (Synonyms: LDC067, HY-15878) were purchased from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, USA). siRNAs were procured from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). The GBP1 cDNA was cloned into the pCDNA3.1-FLAG-C vector, while the STAT3 cDNA was inserted into the pCMV-6 × His-Neo vector. Specific shRNAs were synthesized and cloned into the pLV3-U6-shRNA1-CopGFP-Puro vector. The sequences of all constructs are listed in Table S1. Quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the PrimeScript™ RT kit (Takara, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted with the TB Green Premix® Ex Taq™ kit (Takara, Japan) following the manufacturer’s protocol. β-actin served as the internal control. Primer sequences are provided in Table S2. Colony formation and transwell assay Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at specified densities and transfected with appropriate constructs. After incubation for the designated period, cells were fixed and stained with 0.5 % crystal violet solution. Stained cells were imaged and quantified using ImageJ software. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and clinical specimen collection Osteosarcoma tissue microarray slides (#L072Bn01) were purchased from Zhongke Guanghua (Xi’an) Intelligent Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Standard immunohistochemical procedures were performed, and tissue-specific antibodies were used for staining. The antibodies included GBP1 (#15303-1-AP, Proteintech, 1:250) and PD-L1 (#66248-1-Ig, Proteintech, 1:3000). Staining intensity (SI) was calculated as follows: SI = (percentage of positive cells × staining intensity). In vivo research All animal experiments were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University. Six-week-old BALB/C-nude mice were obtained from SJA Laboratory Animal Company (Changsha, China) and were used in the experiments. At 48 hours post-transfection, experimental cells (5 × 10⁶ cells/mouse) were subcutaneously injected into the left flanks of each mouse. Tumor dimensions were measured with calipers, and tumor volume was calculated as (L × W²)/2. Tumors were excised, measured, and weighed post-euthanasia. Statistical analysis All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). For single comparisons, a paired Student's t-test was used, while one-way ANOVA with post-hoc testing was performed for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01, or ***, P < 0.001. Results are presented as mean ± SD (n=3). Results High expression of PD-L1 may be associated with elevated GBP1 expression To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying elevated PD-L1 expression in osteosarcoma, we analyzed single-cell sequencing data from osteosarcoma cells ( GSE162454 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 GBP1 is upregulated and positively correlated with PD-L1 expression in osteosarcoma. Fig 1 A: Single-cell RNA sequencing ( GSE162454 Using the GEPIA platform, we identified a positive correlation between GBP1 and PD-L1 expression in sarcoma tissues ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 GBP1 enhances proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells GBP1 knockdown by siRNA markedly reduced its expression in osteosarcoma cells ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 GBP1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in osteosarcoma. Fig 2 A-C: MNNG/HOS and U2-OS cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 48 hours. GBP1 expression was assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting (A). Cell proliferation was evaluated using CCK-8 (B) and colony formation assays (C). D-F: MNNG/HOS and U2-OS cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 48 hours. GBP1 overexpression was confirmed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting (D). Proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 (E) and colony formation assays (F). G, H: Cells were transfected with siRNAs or plasmids for 48 hours. Transwell assays were performed to evaluate migration and invasion.I-K: Cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Representative tumor images (I), tumor weights (J), and growth curves (K) are shown. All data are presented as mean ± SD. Experiments were performed in triplicate (A, D, G, H) or quintuplicate (B, C, E, F, I – K). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. GBP1 promotes PD-L1 expression through interaction with STAT3 To elucidate whether GBP1 modulates PD-L1 expression, we silenced GBP1 in MNNG/HOS and U2-OS cells and found that PD-L1 protein and mRNA levels were significantly reduced ( Fig. 3 3 Fig. 3 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 GBP1 promotes PD-L1 expression through interaction with STAT3. Fig 3 A-H: Knockdown of GBP1 decreased, whereas its overexpression increased, PD-L1 mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, PD-L1 knockdown or overexpression did not affect GBP1 levels, as assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. I: ChIP-qPCR confirmed STAT3 binding to the PD-L1 promoter. J-M: STAT3 knockdown reduced, whereas STAT3 overexpression enhanced, both STAT3 binding to the PD-L1 promoter and PD-L1 expression. N–O: GBP1 knockdown reduced, while GBP1 overexpression increased STAT3 binding to the PD-L1 promoter. P: Rescue experiments showed that GBP1 regulates PD-L1 expression in a STAT3-dependent manner. Q: Schematic model illustrating that GBP1 promotes STAT3 recruitment to the PD-L1 promoter, thereby upregulating PD-L1 transcription and translation. All data are mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. To explore the underlying mechanism, we performed Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (CoIP-MS) and identified STAT3 as a GBP1-interacting protein. STAT3 belongs to the signal transducer and activator of transcription family and plays a pivotal role in mediating cytokine and growth factor signaling. Under physiological conditions, STAT3 activity is tightly regulated; however, in many tumors, STAT3 is constitutively activated and has been shown to drive malignant progression. Notably, previous studies reported that STAT3 promotes PD-L1 transcription, linking it to tumor immune evasion [ 12 13 Consistent with this, ChIP-qPCR confirmed STAT3 binding to the PD-L1 promoter ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 GBP1 interacts with STAT3 to promote its phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression To verify the interaction between STAT3 and GBP1, protein docking analysis revealed multiple hydrogen bonds between GBP1 and STAT3 ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 50 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 GBP1 promotes STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation. Fig 4 A: Structure of the STAT3-GBP1 complex displayed using PyMOL. B: Western blot analysis after co-immunoprecipitation in MNNG/HOS and U2-OS cell lines using STAT3 or GBP1 antibodies. C-E: Western blot and RT-qPCR analyses showing that GBP1 overexpression enhanced, while GBP1 knockdown reduced, STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression. Treatment with 0.15 µM STAT3-IN-13 abrogated these effects. Data are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001. F: Schematic model indicating that GBP1 phosphorylates STAT3-T705 to regulate PD-L1 expression. GBP1 promotes STAT3 phosphorylation through interaction with CDK9 CDK9, a serine/threonine protein kinase of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, regulates transcription by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II and has been implicated in oncogenesis and tumor immune evasion [ [14] [15] [16] Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 GBP1 drives STAT3 activation and PD-L1 upregulation through CDK9. Fig 5 A: Predicted docking model of the GBP1–CDK9 complex. B, C: Western blot analysis after co-immunoprecipitation in MNNG/HOS and U2-OS cell lines using GBP1, CDK9, or STAT3 antibodies. D-F: Western blot analyses showing that CDK9 knockdown reduced STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression, which were partially rescued by GBP1 overexpression. Combined knockdown of GBP1 and CDK9 synergistically suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression. Treatment with the CDK9 inhibitor LDC067 (5 µM, 24 h) also inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression, which was partially rescued by GBP1 overexpression, while GBP1 knockdown together with LDC067 treatment further enhanced the suppression. G: Schematic model of the GBP1–CDK9–STAT3 signaling axis regulating PD-L1 expression in osteosarcoma. Knockdown of CDK9 markedly reduced STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression, whereas GBP1 overexpression partially rescued these effects ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 50 Fig. 5 Discussion Guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) is an interferon-γ-induced GTPase [ 17 18 19 20 STAT3, a member of the STAT family, facilitates signal transduction from extracellular cytokines and growth factors to the nucleus, initiating gene transcription. Under normal physiological conditions, STAT3 signaling is tightly regulated. However, in many tumors, STAT3 is constitutively activated, closely associated with tumor malignancy [ 21 22 23 To further elucidate the molecular mechanism by which GBP1 promotes STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation, we analyzed our mass spectrometry data, identifying cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) as a potential GBP1-binding partner that could facilitate STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. CDK9, a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, exists in two isoforms, CDK9-42 and CDK9-55, with CDK9-42 being more widely distributed. CDK9 typically forms a heterodimer with cyclin T1, T2a, or T2b, collectively known as the positive transcription elongation factor (p-TEFb). This complex regulates transcription by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II, influencing its pausing and initiation [ 14 15 16 24 25 26 In summary, our study reveals that GBP1 directly interacts with CDK9, leading to increased STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation. This, in turn, promotes STAT3 activation and nuclear translocation. Once activated, STAT3 binds to the promoters of PD-L1, enhancing their transcription. This signaling axis drives PD-L1 expression, facilitating immune evasion in osteosarcoma. These findings offer a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism by which GBP1 contributes to PD-L1 upregulation in osteosarcoma and provide potential therapeutic targets for PD-L1-based immunotherapy.
