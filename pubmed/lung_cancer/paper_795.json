The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Punicalagin (PCG), a polyphenol obtained from the Punica granatum Graphical abstract  Keywords Punicalagin Polyphenol Triple-negative breast cancer Autophagy LC3 National Research Foundation of Korea 2022R1A4A1025557 Choi Kyung-Chul pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Korean Society of Toxicology 2024 ",
