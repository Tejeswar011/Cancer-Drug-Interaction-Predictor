This knowledge can be utilized for the rational selection of agricultural crop residue extracts and their components and possible use in the development of value‐added products, such as anti‐ageing cosmetics. The appearance of wrinkles, pigmentation, and a reduction in skin elasticity are typical signs of ageing skin that are often alleviated by natural product‐based preparations. Here, we use in silico approaches to identify natural compounds from agricultural crop and food production residues with the potential to alleviate symptoms of or reverse the skin ageing process. Target predictions combined with extensive database and literature searches were utilized to identify compounds present in ACR and proteins linked to skin ageing. The binding affinity of natural products to selected proteins using molecular docking and the respective intermolecular interaction analyses are predicted to provide an indicative measure of the compounds' potential for skin anti‐ageing activity. A number of natural compounds with the potential to interact with protein targets such as collagenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase were identified. In addition to in silico findings, cytotoxicity assays were conducted using rose hip seed extracts against Hs294T (human metastatic melanoma, ATCC HTB‐140) and MRC‐5 (normal fetal lung fibroblasts, ATCC CCL 171), demonstrating selective cytotoxicity. ELISA assays revealed that rose hip seed extracts induced a significant increase in SIRT1 levels (160% of control) and a reduction in TGF‐β levels (80% of control). These experimental results support the potential of agricultural crop residue extracts in modulating key proteins involved in skin ageing, reinforcing their viability as ingredients in anti‐ageing cosmetic formulations. An analysis of the molecular relationships and pathways that organic substances from sustainable sources can affect offers the potential for developing formulations for skin rejuvenation with possible synergistic effects by utilizing the rational design of innovative skincare products and laying the framework for more effective screening of anti‐ageing compounds for different applications. A workflow for identifying sustainable anti‐ageing solutions from agricultural crop and food production residues (ACFPR). A combination of in silico techniques, like database interrogations, target predictions, molecular docking, and ADME predictions can pave the way for the development of innovative, eco‐friendly anti‐ageing cosmetics. Résumé Les résidus de cultures agricoles et de production alimentaire (RPAA) représentent des ressources durables potentielles de composes bénéfiques pour diverses applications, soutenus par des efforts considérables visant à caractériser leur composition et leurs activités biologiques. Ces connaissances peuvent être exploitées pour une sélection rationnelle d’extraits de résidus agricoles et de leurs composants, ainsi que pour leur utilisation potentielle dans le développement de produits à valeur ajoutée, tels que les cosmétiques anti‐âges. L'apparition de rides, l'hyperpigmentation et la diminution de l'élasticité cutanée sont des signes typiques du vieillissement de la peau, souvent attenues par des préparations à base de produits naturels. Ici, nous utilisons des approches in silico pour identifier des composes naturels issus des résidus de cultures agricoles et de production alimentaire ayant le potentiel d'atténuer les symptômes du vieillissement cutané ou d'en inverser le processus. Les prédictions des cibles, combinées à des recherches approfondies dans les bases de données et la littérature, ont permis d’identifier les composes présents dans les RPAA ainsi que les protéines impliquées dans le vieillissement cutané. L'affinité de liaison des produits naturels avec ces protéines a été évaluée à l'aide de l'arrimage moléculaire et d'analyses des interactions intermoléculaires respectives, fournissant une indication du potentiel anti‐âge des composés. Plusieurs composés naturels susceptibles d’interagir avec des cibles protéiques clés, telles que la collagénase, l'élastase et l'hyaluronidase, ont été identifies. En complément des résultats in silico, des essais de cytotoxicité ont été réalisés avec des extraits de graines de cynorhodon sur les lignées cellulaires Hs294T (mélanome métastatique humain, ATCC HTB‐140) et MRC‐5 (fibroblastes pulmonaires fœtaux normaux, ATCC CCL 171), démontrant une cytotoxicité sélective. Les tests ELISA ont révélé que les extraits de graines de cynorhodon induisaient une augmentation significative des niveaux de SIRT1 (160% du contrôle) et une réduction des niveaux de TGF‐β (80% du contrôle). Ces résultats expérimentaux confirment le potentiel des extraits de résidus agricoles dans la modulation des protéines clés impliquées dans le vieillissement cutané, renforçant leur viabilité en tant qu'ingrédients pour les formulations cosmétiques anti‐âge. L'analyse des relations moléculaires et des voies affectées par les substances organiques issues de sources durables ouvre la voie au développement de formulations innovantes pour le rajeunissement de la peau, avec de possibles effets synergiques. L'utilisation d’une conception rationnelle de produits de soin pourrait ainsi poser les bases d'un dépistage plus efficace des composes anti‐âges pour diverses applications. anti‐ageing skincare antioxidant properties bioinformatics collagenase inhibition elastase inhibition gene expression modulation hyaluronidase inhibition molecular docking natural products skin ageing Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia 10.13039/501100016046 142‐451‐3008/2023‐1 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:02.10.2025  Vidović S Ilić M Nakomčić J Nastić N Kvrgić J Song X Mining bioactive components in agricultural crop and food production residue for sustainable solutions: In silico screening for skin anti‐ageing properties Int J Cosmet Sci 2025 47 793 806 10.1111/ics.13059 PMC12489880 40231485 INTRODUCTION There is a significant shift towards sustainable agriculture and the development of diversified rural economies. In addition to utilizing the crop residue for energy generation [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Skin ageing is a multifaceted biological occurrence that is becoming more common in older populations, leading to significant healthcare consequences. The process is regulated by a complex interaction between genetically programmed internal mechanisms and external environmental influences, particularly ultraviolet (UV) light, which causes photo‐ageing [ 8 9 8 9 Various pathological mechanisms [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Virtual screening could serve as a framework for the systematic evaluation of ACFPR influence on skin ageing, facilitated by bioinformatics and computational modelling. Molecular docking predicts the potential strength and mechanism of interaction between targets and ligands, offering a theoretical estimation of their binding affinity and mode. This method provides preliminary insights that are subject to experimental validation to ascertain their true activity [ 17 18 The identification of relevant target proteins integral to the skin ageing process is an essential and integral step [ 19 MATERIALS AND METHODS  3D A set of natural product molecules present in agricultural crop and food production residues, including leaves, branches, peels, and seeds was collated from the literature using Google Scholar, PubChem, and PubMed resources. These sustainable sources available in Vojvodina province and the rest of Serbia include apples (leaves, pomace, skin), beetroots (leaves, root), blueberries (fruit, leaves), carrots (leaves, peel, pomace), cherries (fruit), chokeberries (leaves, pomace, stems), citrus fruit (peel), cranberries (fruit, juice, leaves), garlic, grapevines (green pruning, leaves, pomace, seed, skin, stalks), onions (apical trimming, leaves, outer dry layer, skin), peppers (leaves, seed), plums (leaves, seed, skin), rosehip (herbal dust) and tomatoes (leaves, seed, skin). The literature search resulted in a collection of entries with duplicate molecules that are coming from different sources. The Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings for a set of 172 unique entries were retrieved from PubChem [ 20 21 The SMILES strings were used to generate the molecules' three‐dimensional (3D) conformations using Open Babel, an extensively used open‐source tool for converting and handling chemical data files [ 22 Identification of protein targets The SMILES strings were utilized for the prediction of the putative drug targets for all identified natural products using the SwissTargetPrediction ( http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/ 23 http://www.epigenetictargetprofiler.com/ 24 Homo sapiens Drug targets relevant to the skin ageing process were searched using the Human Gene Database server ( https://www.genecards.org/ 25 The intersection of the predicted targets for the compounds predicted for all selected molecules and skin ageing targets was obtained using Venny 2.1 ( https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ 26 27 Protein structure preparation A subset of common targets with available 3D structural data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [ 28 P14679 These selected structures were prepared for molecular docking using VegaZZ 3.2.3.28 [ 29 S1 Computational docking and analysis Molecular docking was conducted using Autodock Vina [ 30 S1 The crop residues with the highest scores were subjected to detailed visualization and analysis using Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer v21.1.0.20298 [ 31 Cell lines The study utilized two cell lines: Hs294T (ATCC HTB‐140, a human metastatic melanoma cell line) and MRC‐5 (ATCC CCL 171, normal fetal lung fibroblasts). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5% glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FTS, Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), as well as antibiotics and antimycotics (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Culturing was performed in Costar 25 cm 2  MTT Cell growth inhibition was assessed using the tetrazolium colorimetric MTT assay (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) [ 32 33  SIRT1 TGF ELISA Cell extracts of the Hs294T cells (for sirtuin 1 assay) and cell culture supernatants (for transforming growth factor beta 1 assay) were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human sirtuin1 and TGF beta 1 were analysed with ELISA kits (Abcam, ab171573 & ab100647, respectively) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS Library of natural products from ACFPR The literature search of the composition of ACFPRs has yielded a set of 526 entries (Data S2 S1 The most abundant information is available for tomato (19 components in leaves, 56 in seed, 47 in skin, 122 in total), followed by information about the composition of components of plum residue (54 components in leaves, 15 in seed, 27 in skin, 96 in total). The other well‐studied compounds are blueberry (72 components in total) and cranberry (58 components in total); however, some information is available from either juice or fruit, and therefore not strictly speaking from crop or production residue. The removal of duplicates resulted in a list of 174 unique components for which structures and SMILES strings are available (Data S2 S2 Skin ageing target identification The SMILES library of ACFPR compounds was used to predict their drug targets by interrogating the SwissTargetPrediction server. The total number of protein targets with a probability of compounds being able to interact with them was 701 proteins, but only 160 proteins are considered as the top six hits for each molecule (Data S2 S3 1 TABLE 1 Top ten predicted targets for components of ACPFR.

As a case study for the use of ACFPR extracts, their potential application in minimizing the effects of skin ageing is explored. Therefore, relevant protein targets were searched for in the Human Gene Database. A total of 139 entries were found to contain both skin and anti‐ageing keywords Data S2 S5 These protein‐encoding genes were intersected with predicted targets using the Venny tool and it was found that 8 targets are common in the Gene Database and library predicted by the SwissTargetPrediction tool (Figure 1 2 FIGURE 1 Overlapping target proteins found in the Human Gene Database (protein‐encoding genes that are related to skin anti‐ageing) and drug targets of ACFPR compounds predicted by SwissTargetPrediction and Epigenetic Target Profiler.

The receptors selected for this investigation were crucial skin proteins, encompassing particular enzymes acknowledged for their substantial contributions to skin well‐being and ailments. The target proteins included collagenase, hyaluronidase, laminin, fibronectin, sirtuin, and tyrosinase. Each of these proteins plays a crucial role in skin physiology and the ageing process, serving as important markers. Their individual PDB codes were utilized to identify and retrieve their structural data for the docking simulations. The coordinates of the active site for each protein receptor were established and setup as grid boxes using Autodock Vina to conduct the docking. This ensured that the predicted interactions took place at the biologically relevant sites of the selected proteins. The results of docking (Data S2 S6 S2 S6 An example of interactions between selected compounds with various biological targets, such as sirtuin 6, tyrosinase, collagenase, fibronectin, hyaluronidase, laminin, and their average binding scores per target is shown in Table 3 2 TABLE 3 The docking scores (kcal/mol) of selected ligand‐receptor complexes were predicted using AutoDock Vina.

These diagrams are derived from the binding energies recorded in (Table 2 These ligands, extracted from agricultural crop residues, include tomatine from tomato leaves, cinnamtannin B1 from cranberry leaves, luteolin‐7‐O‐glucopyranoside (cynaroside) from pepper leaves, campesterol from cranberry leaves, and procyanidin B1 from plum skin and apple peel. The understanding of their binding affinities is crucial for the progression of research into bioactive compounds. The ligand tomatine exhibits remarkable binding affinities, ranking among the highest observed in our docking output. Tomatine demonstrated the highest affinity for the 7RK7 protein target, with a binding strength of −10.4 kcal/mol, as shown in Table 3 Cinnamtannin B1 demonstrated high binding affinities, particularly with the sirtuin‐6 (3 K35: −10.7 kcal/mol) and the 7RK7 protein (−10.3 kcal/mol), as shown in Table 3 Cynaroside, also known as luteolin‐7‐O‐glucopyranoside, was found to be an exceptionally effective ligand. It displayed its strongest binding affinity of −10.6 kcal/mol towards the 7RK7 protein target, as indicated in Table 3 Campesterol exhibited significant interactions, particularly with the 3 K35 receptor, demonstrating a binding affinity of −10.3 kcal/mol, as stated in Table 3 Procyanidin B1, which is included in our list of top ligands, exhibited significant binding affinities. Specifically, it displayed binding affinities of −8.8 kcal/mol for 1CGL, −7.7 kcal/mol for 1FNF, −7.5 kcal/mol for 2PE4, −9.1 kcal/mol for 3 K35, −10 kcal/mol for 5XAU, and − 9.6 kcal/mol for 7RK7, as shown in Table 3 Following the previous steps of molecular docking, we have utilized the Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer to generate a comprehensive visualization of the protein binding pockets.

ELISA assays were conducted to quantify the levels of SIRT1 and TGF‐beta in treated cell lines. Cells treated with rose hip seed extracts exhibited a significant increase in SIRT1 levels, reaching 160% of the control, and a reduction in TGF‐beta levels to 80% of the control. This indicates that the extracts may enhance SIRT1 expression, which is linked to anti‐ageing effects, while simultaneously reducing TGF‐beta levels, potentially mitigating fibrosis and inflammation. The compounds known to be present in the extract, including campesterol, sitosterol, and tocopherols [ 34 S2 S4 35 36 Case study – Plum seed extract The variation in binding affinities of components of extracts illustrates the complex network of interactions between small molecules and protein targets, underscoring the importance of thorough screening in identifying lead compounds with outstanding specificity and efficacy. However, the selected examples belong to different ACFRP extracts, and therefore it is important to identify a single extract that could potentially be used in cosmetic formulations. The average docking scores per compound (Data S2 S6 An additional literature search unravelled the possible presence of additional compounds, for which only 66 out of 548 proteins predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction server were in the top six hits. Out of these, 45 targets were unique and six were in common with the results of Gene Cards (Data S2 S7 S1 4 TABLE 4 The binding scores of selected plum seed extract complexed with collagenase (1CGL), elastase (1ELB), tumour necrosis factor‐alpha (2AZ5) and sirtuin 1 (4I5I).

Although the predicted docking scores are lower compared to some of the observed values in Data S2 S6 18 DISCUSSION This study has offered valuable insights into the utilization of compounds derived from value‐added agricultural products in the field of skin anti‐ageing. Compounds such as tomatine, cinnamtannin B1, luteolin‐7‐O‐glucopyranoside (cynaroside), campesterol, and procyanidin B1 have been identified due to their significant interactions with skin proteins, which are essential for their potential involvement in anti‐ageing treatments. The inhibition of proteins such as sirtuin, tyrosinase, collagenase, fibronectin, hyaluronidase, and laminin has been correlated with positive effects on skin anti‐ageing in previous studies. Their inhibition correlates with improved skin resilience, even tone, firmness, repair, hydration, and texture respectively [ 37 The utilization of natural products in cosmetic formulations has been a cornerstone of the industry, with a history of incorporating botanical extracts and compounds for their therapeutic properties. In the realm of anti‐ageing, these natural constituents have been selected for their ability to synergise with the skin's biological mechanisms [ 7 38 39 Additionally, the whole extract of plum seed also has a significant potential to interact with these skin protein targets. It has already been shown that epicatechin and epigallocatechin can be used in skin protection from UV radiation [ 40 41 42 43 44 The transition from traditional, holistic applications to targeted, mechanistic utilization reflects a paradigm shift in cosmetic science [ 45 46 47 48 The molecular docking techniques combined with literature and databases interrogation aided the evaluation of binding affinities of plant‐derived ligands, specifically those obtained from value‐added agricultural products, to protein targets involved in the skin ageing process. This computational approach is based on tested models, offering a fast and cost‐effective alternative to traditional experimental methods. Expanding on the groundwork laid by previous studies, we followed established procedures to guarantee the accuracy of our computer‐generated forecasts [ 49 The computational outputs suggest that the simultaneous delivery of several molecules on the skin may offer anti‐ageing benefits. By potentially targeting multiple pathways, these combinations could work together to combat the signs of ageing more effectively than single agents. For example, the theoretical application of various molecules could offer a range of anti‐ageing effects, such as mitigating oxidative damage, promoting skin hydration, and supporting collagen integrity [ 50 51 52 Nevertheless, the intricate nature of biological systems poses difficulties that our computational techniques may not comprehensively address. An example of this is the limited capability of molecular docking to consider the dynamic alterations in protein structure, the effects of the cellular surroundings, and the possible consequences of solvent interactions. This may result in an oversimplified representation of the biological reality. These factors may lead to differences between the anticipated and actual binding affinities, thereby serving as a constraint to the study [ 53 S2 S3 S4 The outcomes obtained from our molecular docking investigations are inherently relative, as opposed to being absolute, because of the characteristics of the docking algorithms and the scoring functions employed to assess binding affinities [ 53 54 55 Future research should focus on closing the disparity between computational predictions and empirical evidence. Performing in vitro assays to verify the molecular docking results would be the next logical step, adding a level of validation to the in silico findings. Consequently, conducting in vivo studies, such as clinical trials, is crucial to determine the effectiveness and safety of these compounds on human skin. This would serve as the definitive assessment of their potential as anti‐ageing agents [ 56 57 CONCLUSION This study into the impact of 174 compounds known to be in extracts of a wide variety of agricultural crop and food production residues on skin protein targets associated with ageing represents a novel contribution to the field. The integration of modern drug discovery methods offers new approaches to functional product development. While many studies have focused on individual or small groups of targets, this expansive analysis offers a comparative and statistical perspective that is relatively unexplored. It is important to acknowledge the inherent limitations of computational research, such as the potential for discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical outcomes, as well as the lack of comprehensive information on the content of the extract, including quantitative information. Nevertheless, this study lays the groundwork for future research that integrates computational predictions with experimental validation, advancing the development of sustainable and scientifically substantiated anti‐ageing skincare formulations.
