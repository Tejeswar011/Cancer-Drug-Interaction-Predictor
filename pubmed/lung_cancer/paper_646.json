Based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database, we analyzed the global, regional, and national burdens and trends of IE in children and adolescents (aged 0–19 years). Methods Utilizing the GBD 2021 data, we analyzed the prevalence, incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and mortality of IE across 204 countries and regions globally. The regions were stratified according to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Time trends were assessed using the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). Results Over a 32-year period, global IE prevalence and incidence cases increased by 19% and 29%, while DALYs and death cases declined by 9% and 20%, respectively. Prevalence, DALYs, and death rates decreased annually, except for incidence rates, which rose. Low-middle SDI regions showed the highest disease burden, while high SDI regions experienced the greatest increase in prevalence rates. By age, the 10–19 age group had the highest growth in prevalence and incidence rates, while the <5 age group showed the largest decline in DALYs and death rates. Conclusion The total number of IE cases increased, while DALYs and mortality rates decreased, reflecting the improvement of global medical interventions. The disease burden remains high in low SDI regions, and it is necessary to optimize prevention and control strategies according to the characteristics of different regions, ages, and genders.

In addition, people with epilepsy face a higher risk of injury, premature death, and social discrimination [ 23 24 Although the GBD 2021 Epilepsy Collaborators have provided an overview of the global disease burden of epilepsy, they have not conducted an in-depth analysis of the specific subtype of IE [ 22 Methods Data source and disease definition The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database provides comprehensive epidemiological data spanning from 1990 to 2021, covering 21 GBD regions, 204 countries, and 371 diseases, offering researchers a global perspective on health issues and allowing for detailed analysis and comparison across various regions [ 25–29 30 Estimation and analysis of disability-adjusted Life years, prevalence, incidence, and mortality In this study, we used pre-processed estimated data provided by the GBD 2021 database. The original input data were extracted from vital registration systems, verbal autopsy records, and surveillance data. A Bayesian meta-regression model (DisMod-MR 2.1) was used to generate age-, sex-, year-, and location-specific prevalence and incidence rates for IE [ 22 25 31 32 22 22 Estimated annual percentage change The Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) is a valuable tool for understanding trends over time [ 33 30 Results Global level Over the past 32 years, there has been a significant increase in the global prevalence and incidence cases of IE, with percentage changes of 19% and 29%, respectively ( Figure 1A Figure 1B-F Table 1 Tables S1 Figure 1.

Both genders showed significant increases compared to 1990, with almost identical percentage changes. The absolute number of incidence cases among males was also higher than among females, with both showing a 29% increase, indicating a higher growth trend. Additionally, males and females experienced a downward trend in DALYs and death cases ( Figure 1G–J Tables S4 SDI regional level In 2021, regions with low-middle SDI and middle SDI accounted for over half of the global total of IE prevalence and incidence cases. Meanwhile, low SDI and low-middle SDI regions had more than three-fifths of the global total for DALYs and death cases. Over the past 32 years, there were no significant changes in prevalence and incidence cases in middle SDI and high SDI regions. In contrast, low SDI regions showed the highest increase in all metrics, with percentage changes of 102%, 113%, 61%, and 48% for prevalence, incidence, DALYs, and death cases, respectively. High-middle SDI regions experienced the highest decrease in DALYs and death cases, with percentage changes of −52% and −69%. Notably, high SDI regions had the highest increasing trend in prevalence rates, with an EAPC of 0.22 (CI: 0.1 to 0.34), while low SDI regions had the steepest decreasing trend, with an EAPC of −0.24 (CI: −0.29 to −0.19). Except for the low SDI regions, the other four SDI regions showed a significant upward trend in incidence rates. Regarding DALYs and death rates, five SDI regions exhibited a yearly decreasing trend, with the high-middle SDI regions showing the most significant decline, with EAPC of −1.95 (CI: −2.01 to −1.88) and −3.22 (CI: −3.3 to −3.14), respectively ( Figure 2A-C Figures S1-S3 Figure 2.

GBD region level Over the past 32 years, about two-thirds of GBD regions have seen an upward trend in the absolute number of IE prevalence and incidence cases, with the most significant increases in Oceania, Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Sub-Saharan Africa, and Western Sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and High-income Asia Pacific have experienced the most notable declines. About one-third of GBD regions have shown an upward trend in DALYs and death cases, with the most significant increases in Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, and Western Sub-Saharan Africa; whereas East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe have seen the most significant decreases. Overall, the majority of GBD regions have experienced a yearly declining trend in prevalence, incidence, DALYs, and death rates. Andean Latin America has the highest decrease in prevalence and incidence rates, with EAPC of −0.83 (CI: −1.05 to −0.61) and −0.49 (CI: −0.65 to −0.32), respectively. East Asia has the most significant decrease in DALYs rates, with an EAPC of −2.99 (CI: −3.1 to −2.88). Additionally, Eastern Europe has the highest decrease in death rates, with an EAPC of −4.77 (CI: −5.39 to −4.15) ( Figure 2A-C Figures S1-S3 Country level Over the past 32 years, about two-thirds of countries have seen an increase in IE prevalence and incidence cases, while about one-third have seen an increase in DALYs and death cases ( Figure 3A Figures S4 Figure 3.

The 10–19 age group had the most notable increase in prevalence cases, exceeding 30%, which is much higher than the global average. In terms of incidence cases, the 5–9 age group, 10–14 age group, and 15–19 age group had increases significantly higher than the global average, with percentage changes of 30%, 41%, and 41%, respectively.

Conversely, the DALYs and death rates for all age groups have shown a significant downward trend, with the <5 age group having the largest decrease in DALYs rates and the 5–9 age group having the largest decrease in death rates. In low SDI regions, there is a rapid growth trend in prevalence, incidence, DALYs, and death cases for all age groups, with the 15–19 age group showing the largest increase, with percentage changes of 147%, 172%, 109%, and 101%, respectively ( Figure 4C Figures S13 Figure 4D Figures S16 Tables S12 In high SDI regions, the prevalence increase is most significant for the 10–14 and 15–19 age groups, with EAPC of 0.26 (CI: 0.12 to 0.4) and 0.26 (CI: 0.1 to 0.41), respectively. The incidence increase is most significant for the 15–19 age group in low-middle SDI regions, with an EAPC of 0.43 (CI: 0.35 to 0.51). However, the <5 age group in high-middle SDI regions shows the largest decrease in DALYs and death rates, with EAPC of −2.95 (CI: −3.05 to −2.84) and −4.36 (CI: −4.57 to −4.15), respectively. Globally, IE prevalence, incidence, DALYs, and death cases increase with age. In 2021, the proportion of prevalence cases for the 10–14 age and 15–19 age groups increased by 2% and 3% compared to 1990, respectively. Among the five SDI regions, the largest increase in the proportion of prevalence cases was seen in the 15–19 age group of low-middle SDI regions, with an increase of 6% compared to 1990 ( Figures S19 Additionally, in every age group, the prevalence rates for males are higher than for females, with the largest difference in the 5–9 age group ( Figure 4E Figures S22-S24 The association between IE disease burden and SDI In 2021, there was a significant negative correlation between the DALYs and death rates of IE and the SDI, with correlation coefficients of R=-0.762 and R=-0.713, respectively, and p-values less than 0.001, indicating a statistically significant relationship. This correlation suggests that as SDI increases, the DALYs and death rates significantly decrease, indicating higher rates in regions with lower economic and social development levels. This trend may be driven by various factors, including improved medical service capacity, better control of risk factors, and lifestyle improvements. However, it is noteworthy that some high SDI regions, such as Western Europe, have a higher IE disease burden than predicted by models, suggesting the presence of other unrecognized risk factors or issues with the distribution of medical resources, which warrant further investigation. It is also important to mention that the prevalence and incidence rates of IE have a weak correlation with SDI, indicating that these rates may be less directly influenced by the level of socio-economic development. This suggests that the prevalence and incidence of the disease may be more determined by genetic, environmental, or other non-economic factors rather than solely by the level of economic and social development ( Figure 5 Figures S25 Figure 5. The associations between the SDI and prevalent rates per 100,000 population of idiopathic epilepsy in children and adolescents across 21 GBD regions. Discussion Globally, the prevalence and incidence cases of IE have increased, while DALYs and mortality cases have declined. Prevalence and incidence cases have risen by 19% and 29%, respectively, but DALYs and deaths cases have decreased by 9% and 20%. There’s a downward trend in prevalence, DALY, and death rates, but an upward trend in incidence rates. Men have a slightly higher prevalence than women, with both experiencing growth, though women show a greater decline in DALYs and death rates. These changes may be linked to improved medical interventions and disease management [ 34 35 36 Regional disparities in IE are evident, with low SDI regions showing the highest growth in all metrics, while high-middle SDI regions show the greatest decline in DALYs and deaths cases. High SDI regions have the highest increase in prevalence rates, while low SDI regions show the most significant decrease. Except for low SDI regions, incidence rates rise in other SDI regions. All SDI regions see a decrease in DALYs and death rates, with the high-middle SDI region experiencing the largest drop. At the GBD regional level, most regions show an upward trend in IE prevalence and incidence cases, particularly in Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and High-income Asia Pacific have seen declines. DALYs and death cases are increasing in some regions, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, while they decrease in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe. Most regions show a downward trend in prevalence, incidence, DALYs, and death rates, with Andean Latin America and East Asia experiencing the largest decreases. These trends highlight global health inequities and differences in resources, medical conditions, and preventive measures between regions. The growth of IE in low SDI regions may be related to resource scarcity and inadequate medical conditions, while improvements in high SDI regions may be linked to their economic development and better healthcare systems. Of note, in low SDI regions, epilepsy may have been misclassified as IE, whereas it is actually epilepsy induced by parasitic diseases such as neurocysticercosis and onchocercosis [ 37–39 40 41–45 Globally, the prevalence and incidence cases of IE among children and adolescents have increased since 1990, especially in the 10–19 age group. Despite this, all age groups show a downward trend in DALYs and death rates, with the most significant declines in the <5 age group and the 5–9 age group. IE trends vary across regions with different development levels. The number of IE incidence cases among the 15–19 age group in low SDI regions are increasing rapidly, while the incidence rates in the 10–14 age groups in high SDI regions are growing more significantly. Men generally have higher prevalence and incidence rates than women across all age groups, with the 15–19 age group having the highest DALYs rates and the largest differences between genders. The SDI is negatively correlated with the disease burden of IE, meaning regions with higher economic development levels have lower DALYs and death rates. Additionally, the relationship between IE prevalence and incidence rates and SDI is not as close as that between DALYs and death rates and SDI, suggesting that the occurrence of IE may be more influenced by genetic, environmental, and other non-economic factors. These observations emphasize the importance of developing public health strategies tailored to different ages, genders, and regional characteristics to effectively reduce the disease burden of IE. The study has the following limitations. First, there are significant differences in the reporting methods of IE across regions, and some areas may have data missing or biased due to insufficient medical resources or reporting mechanisms, affecting the accuracy of the analysis. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa (Zambia, Somalia, Angola) bears the highest disease burden, yet suffers from a severe lack of systematic data due to reliance on fragmented cause-of-death inferences and limited epidemiological surveys. In some Latin American countries (Ecuador, Mexico), although the highest global incidence rates have been reported, inadequate healthcare coverage in remote rural and indigenous areas has led to a significant underestimation of actual data. In conflict-affected regions (Yemen), where health systems have collapsed and cause-of-death registration has nearly ceased, data rely entirely on model-based estimations. Second, the GBD database has a certain time lag, making it difficult to fully reflect the latest epidemiological trends. Lastly, the GBD study relies on population-level data, lacking individual clinical information, which limits a comprehensive interpretation of patient disease characteristics and heterogeneity. Conclusion In summary, the global trends for IE show a significant increase in the number of prevalence and incidence cases, while DALYs and mortality cases have declined, reflecting improvements in medical interventions and disease management. Males have higher prevalence and incidence rates than females, but females exhibit a more pronounced decline in DALYs and mortality rates. The 10–19 age group experiences the fastest growth in incidence cases. Low SDI regions bear a higher disease burden with the most rapid increase in incidence cases, whereas high SDI regions show a significant downward trend in disease burden, although some areas, like Western Europe, have higher-than-expected disease burdens. Overall, there is a significant negative correlation between DALYs and mortality rates and the level of socio-economic development. In the future, it will be necessary to develop targeted public health strategies based on regional, age, and gender characteristics to reduce the global disease burden of IE.
