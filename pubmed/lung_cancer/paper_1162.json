Introduction The advancement of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a substantial risk to worldwide public health [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 8 9 10 One of the highest-priority pathogens is Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa 11 11 P. aeruginosa 12 Because of the rapid progression and potential for immediate and irreversible vision loss, P. aeruginosa 13 14 P. aeruginosa P. aeruginosa 15 P. aeruginosa 16 Treatment strategies typically include topical antibiotics; however, the growing incidence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa 13 P. aeruginosa 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Ocular drug delivery faces substantial obstacles because of the complicated anatomy and various protective ocular barriers [ 30 31 32 33 34 Nanocarriers have markedly enhanced ocular drug delivery by presenting advanced therapeutic strategies that exceed conventional drug delivery systems. These developments allow the penetration of corneal barriers, boost transcorneal drug permeability, prolong drug retention times, decrease the frequency of dosing, enhance patient adherence, offer controlled and prolonged release, and facilitate accurate drug targeting [ 35 Currently, there are no widely commercially approved ocular products of CTZ due to its poor aqueous stability and rapid degradation in solution [ 36 37 36 The current study focused on utilizing simple and scalable nanocarriers that exhibit low ocular toxicity, enhanced corneal penetration capabilities, and controlled release properties. Therefore, two nanocarriers were selected: one consisted of invasomes (INVs), a deformable vesicular nanocarrier that may possess antimicrobial activity due to its terpenoid components, and the other was nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), which have low toxicity and improved stability and provide sustained release [ 38 P. aeruginosa INVs are deformable vesicular systems that have garnered attention for their enhanced capabilities to penetrate biological barriers. While previous studies on INVs have primarily focused on transdermal drug delivery, their distinct compositions and characteristics suggest a potential application in ocular drug delivery, particularly for antimicrobial agents. INVs are typically composed of phospholipids, surfactants, and edge activators (often terpenes or terpene mixtures) [ 39 40 Additionally, the enhanced drug bioavailability accompanying INVs’ delivery can reduce the necessary dose frequency, which is especially beneficial in chronic or extended ocular treatments, thereby enhancing patient adherence. INVs exhibit advantageous stability characteristics, with some formulations remaining stable for extended periods even at room temperature, thereby facilitating their practical application in ophthalmic solutions [ 41 42 NLCs are second-generation lipid nanoparticles that offer several merits over conventional drug delivery systems for ocular applications [ 43 44 45 33 32 41 46 47 Given these considerations, this study investigates the development of an innovative ophthalmic formulation that combines CTZ-loaded INVs or CTZ-loaded NLCs with NAC for the healing of P. aeruginosa 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials Ceftazidime was generously gifted by the Egyptian International Pharmaceutical Industries Co. (Cairo, Egypt); N-acetylcysteine was generously gifted by South Egypt Drug Industries Co. (Cairo, Egypt); phosphatidylcholine from soybean, as well as fluorescein diacetate, was acquired from the Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA); limonene (purity: 96%) was attained from Alfa Aesar (GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany); chloroform and Tween 80 were obtained from El-Nasr Pharmaceutical Co. (Cairo, Egypt); glyceryl behenate (Compritol 888 ATO ® ® 2.2. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR spectroscopy was utilized to explore the possible chemical interactions and compatibility of CTZ and NAC within the formulation. The infrared spectra of the individual drugs and their physical combination (in a ratio of 1:1) were acquired using an FTIR device (Bruker, Coventry, UK). One milligram of each sample was blended with 100 mg KBr, compressed into a tablet, and the FTIR spectrum was recorded within the range of 4000–400 cm −1 −1 48 49 2.3. Design of Experiment The principal goal of the present design was to optimize a CTZ-loaded INV formulation according to specific conditions, such as achieving the highest entrapment efficiency (EE%), zeta potential (ZP), and percentage drug release after 8 h (Q8), while minimizing the particle size (PS) and polydispersity index (PDI). During primary screening, independent factors that could influence these parameters were identified, and a 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 Table 1 2.4. Preparation of CTZ-Loaded INVs Initially, limonene and lipids were introduced into a round-bottom flask and solubilized in a mixture of organic solvents, i.e., 30 mL of 1:1 methanol to chloroform. A thin film was developed after evaporating the organic solvents at 40 °C under a vacuum for 30 min, employing a rotary evaporator (Heidolph VV 2000, Nuremberg, Germany) at 150 rpm [ 50 51 2.5. Evaluation of CTZ-Loaded INVs 2.5.1. Determination of Entrapment Efficiency Briefly, two milliliters of each CTZ-loaded formula was introduced into semi-permeable membrane tubing (MW of 12,000–14,000 Da), subsequently submerged in 50 mL of distilled water, and stirred at 50 rpm for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min employing a magnetic stirrer. The free CTZ was diffused into the aqueous medium until a steady concentration was attained. The free CTZ was detected via a UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601 PC; Kyoto, Japan) at λ max 52 53 E E % = T o t a l  C T Z  a m o u n t − D i f f u s e d  C T Z  a m o u n t T o t a l  C T Z  a m o u n t × 100 All evaluations were completed in triplicate ± SD. 2.5.2. Determination of Particle Size, Polydispersity Index, and Zeta Potential The PS, PDI, and ZP of the INV formulations were assessed by employing a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) through the dynamic light scattering method at ambient temperature, subsequent to appropriate dilution [ 53 2.5.3. In Vitro Drug Release Study The in vitro drug release of CTZ from INV formulations was assessed utilizing a locally manufactured Franz diffusion cell with a functioning release area of 3.14 cm 2 53 0 2.6. Formulation and Optimization of CTZ-Loaded NLCs 2.6.1. Design of Experiment The impacts of the total lipid concentration (X 1 2 3 3 1 2 3 4 Table 2 2.6.2. Preparation of CTZ-Loaded NLCs NLCs were formulated by employing a sequence of hot-melt emulsification, high-speed stirring, and ultrasonication. Briefly, Compritol and liquid oil were blended and warmed under adequate stirring at 85 °C to produce a homogenous, clear oil layer. The percentage of Compritol and the types of liquid oils are demonstrated in Table 2 w v 54 2.6.3. Evaluation of CTZ-Loaded NLCs As previously described in Section 2.5 2.6.4. Selecting the Optimized Formulae The optimized INV formula and optimized NLC formula were selected utilizing the desirability function tool. The basis for choosing the formulation was to achieve the lowest PDI and PS, while maintaining the maximum Q8, EE%, and ZP values. To obtain a promising combined therapy for P. aeruginosa 29 2.7. Characterization of Optimized Formulae 2.7.1. Morphology The morphologies of the chosen INV and NLC formulations were analyzed employing a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Each formulation was diluted tenfold and thereafter placed on a carbon-coated grid; for negative staining, one percent of phosphotungstic acid was utilized prior to drying for imaging [ 55 2.7.2. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) To demonstrate the thermal characteristics of CTZ within INVs or NLCs, pure CTZ, lyophilized optimized CTZ-loaded INVs, lyophilized optimized CTZ-loaded NLCs, and individual components of each formula were analyzed using DSC. A thermal analyzer (TA-60, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was utilized to scan the DSC thermograms. The powders were tightly enclosed in aluminum pans, and their temperature was raised from room temperature to 400 °C at a constant rate of 10 °C/min. 2.7.3. X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) The optimized CTZ-loaded formulae were freeze-dried after the addition of 5% mannitol and frozen at −18 °C for 24 h. Next, the frozen solutions were kept in a freeze dryer (Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MO, USA) at −45 °C and a vacuum of 0.07 mbar for 48 h to obtain the lyophilized formulae [ 56 57 2.7.4. Impact of Storage on Optimized Formulae The ability of each nanocarrier to maintain its characteristics over 90 days was assessed. Each formulation was maintained at 4 °C for 90 days and then evaluated by matching its characteristics with those of the new formulation. Furthermore, each formulation was subjected to visual inspection for sedimentation. 2.8. Comparative Evaluation of Optimized CTZ-Loaded INV and Optimized CTZ-Loaded NLC Formulae 2.8.1. Ex Vivo Corneal Permeation Studies Ex vivo corneal permeation assessments were performed utilizing a Franz diffusion cell with an active diffusion area of 0.785 cm 2 v v 58 0 2.8.2. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Study (CLSM) Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) was utilized as a substitute for CTZ at a concentration of 1% w v Section 2.8.1 2.9. Microbiological Assessment of Optimized Formulae 2.9.1. Screening of Antimicrobial Activity of Optimized Formulae In the present research, the antimicrobial activity of the optimized IVS and NLC formulae was evaluated utilizing the well diffusion method, as depicted by Berghe and Vlietinck (1991) [ 59 P. aeruginosa In this experiment, an adequate dilution (microbial suspension) was prepared, followed by the pouring of the medium into a Petri dish. Next, concentric 6 mm diameter wells were created, which were occupied with 20 µL of the formula or drug to be tested. After a 45 min pre-incubation period at 25 °C, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to permit P. aeruginosa P. aeruginosa 60 2.9.2. In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of Optimized Formulae Determination of MIC and MBC The antimicrobial efficacy of the two formulations, the NLC and INV, against a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa 61 62 63 In brief, 100 µL of sterile broth was instilled in all wells in the plate. Next, 100 µL of the antimicrobial agent was introduced to the first well of each row. Serial two-fold dilutions were created across the row (for example, from column 1 to column 10), ensuring that each transfer was mixed entirely to attain a range of concentrations. Then, 100 µL from the last well was removed to maintain equal volumes across all wells. A standardized inoculum of P. aeruginosa 5 P. aeruginosa 64 Biofilm Inhibition Assay The inhibition of biofilm formation was evaluated utilizing flat-bottom 96-well plates, as stated previously by Haney et al. (2018, 2015) [ 65 66 P. aeruginosa P. aeruginosa 600 Biofilm inhibition % = [OD Control − OD Test)/OD Control] × 100 The results from three biological replicates, each with three technical wells, were averaged and are presented as the mean ± SD. Biofilm Detachment Assay The ability of the tested formulations to eliminate already developed biofilms was assessed by the addition of 190 µL of MHB and 10 µL of inoculum to a polystyrene plate. After 24 h of P. aeruginosa 67 2.10. In Vivo Assessment of Selected Optimized Formula All animal care and studies conducted in this research were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy at Cairo University (Approval No. PI 3290), in compliance with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” set forth by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research (Washington, DC, USA). Forty male Wistar albino rats without ocular damage or diseases, each weighing 150 g, were obtained from the MUST animal center to assess the therapeutic effects of the CTZ-loaded nanocarrier combined with NAC in a keratitis model induced by P. aeruginosa The rats were randomly classified into five groups utilizing the random number table method, with eight rats in each group ( n 8 P. aeruginosa 68 2.10.1.

Statistical Analysis of Data To evaluate the significant differences among the outcomes of the examined formulae, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was utilized. The significance level was established at 0.05, and p 3. Results and Discussion 3.1.

Factorial Design Optimization for INV Formulae One of the objectives of this research was to improve the ocular bioavailability of CTZ. Therefore, the PS was considered the most crucial factor in the current study, as nanocarriers with a smaller PS can effectively penetrate corneal mucosal membranes and overcome ocular barriers, thereby facilitating deeper drug delivery into corneal tissues [ 74 P. aeruginosa 75 76 The factors investigated for INVs were (X 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 Supplementary Materials, Table S1 Table 3 3.3.

Factorial Design Optimization for NLC Formulae As previously mentioned, the PS may be considered the predominant factor that affects the amount of CTZ permeated across the corneal tissues. Therefore, a primary screening was conducted, and the factors that might affect the PSs of NLCs were included in the design. Furthermore, liquid oils with diverse HLB values were selected to assess their impacts on the characteristics of the fabricated NLC formulae. The variables investigated for NLCs were (X 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 Supplementary Materials, Table S2 Table 4 3.5. Evaluation of CTZ-Loaded NLCs 3.5.1.

Selection of Optimized Formulae To select the optimized INV formula and optimized NLC formula, definite constraints were adjusted in Design-Expert. These requirements were applied to identify the formulae with the highest EE%, ZP, and Q8, as well as the lowest PS and PDI. The optimized IVN formulation that fulfilled these conditions consisted of a 0.129% limonene concentration, 144.865 mg of lipids, and a sonication time of 10 min. The calculated desirability score of the optimized formulation was 0.730. In comparison, the optimized NLC formulation that fulfilled these parameters was F6, composed of 2% total lipids, 90% solid lipids, and Labrasol as the oil phase. The calculated desirability score of the optimized formulation was 0.618. Consequently, these formulae were chosen for further evaluation. 3.7. Characterization of Optimized Formulae 3.7.1. Morphology The TEM images of the optimized formulae showed that both nanocarriers were spherical, as revealed in Figure 6 3.7.2. Differential Scanning Calorimetry DSC was utilized to study the crystalline states and thermal behavior of the individual components and the optimized formulae. Regarding the optimized INV formula, DSC thermograms were recorded for CTZ, NAC, lipids, limonene, and the optimized INV formula, as demonstrated in Figure 7 51 Regarding the optimized NLC formula ( Figure 7 54 55 3.7.3. X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) Pure CTZ exhibited peaks at 10.21°, 14.95°, 16.42°, 18.88°, 24.04°, 26.87°, and 30.14°, while NAC exhibited peaks at 16.13°, 21.67 °, 23.35°, 30.55°, 32.05°, and 35.63°, which were indicative of their crystalline states. When evaluating the XPRD patterns of the lyophilized formulae, no peaks related to CTZ were detected, indicating that CTZ was loaded into the nanocarrier in the amorphous state. Moreover, no peaks related to NAC were observed, as illustrated in Figure 8 3.7.4. Impact of Storage on Optimized Formulae The impact of storage on the selected formulae was examined. Visual examination revealed no sedimentation or vesicle aggregation throughout the storage time in both formulae. Additionally, the measurements of the EE%, PS, PDI, and ZP were 86.07 ± 2.28%, 112.9 ± 4.5 nm, 0.506 ± 0.06, and −33.7 ± 0.90 mV, respectively, for the optimized INV formula. In comparison, the optimized NLC formula yielded values of 82.09 ± 1.6%, 218 ± 5.6 nm, 0.280 ± 0.019, and 19.5 ± 2.4 mV, respectively. These outcomes demonstrated no statistically significant difference compared to the newly prepared formulae (paired t p 3.8. Comparative Evaluation of Optimized CTZ-Loaded INV and Optimized CTZ-Loaded NLC Formulae 3.8.1. Ex Vivo Corneal Permeation Studies The permeation studies demonstrated enhancements in the cumulative permeated amount of CTZ from either INVs or NLCs compared to the drug solution, as demonstrated in Figure 9 2 Compared to the CTZ solution, CTZ-INVs demonstrated a nearly 2.6-fold increase and a 1.2-fold increase in Kp compared to the drug solution and NLC formula, respectively. Furthermore, the corneal deposition achieved by CTZ-INVs was 105 µg/cm 2 2 2 102 3.8.2. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Study CLSM assessed the efficiency of permeation and the fluorescence light intensities of FDA-labeled INVs, FDA-labeled NLCs, and an FDA solution. Images obtained with CLSM showed that the FDA-labeled INVs and FDA-labeled NLCs exhibited higher fluorescence deposition in various corneal tissues compared to the FDA solution ( Figure 10 p 3.9. Microbiological Assessment of Optimized Formulae 3.9.1. Determination of MIC and MBC The results regarding the MIC and MBC are presented in Figure 11 28 103 104 3.9.2. Determination of Biofilm Inhibition Assay The anti-biofilm activity of the tested formulations, loaded with CTZ and in the presence of NAC, was compared to that of the aqueous solution of CTZ alone and the aqueous solution of CTZ combined with NAC at concentrations below the determined MIC (0.5–0.25 MIC). At all investigated concentrations, the tested formulations (CTZ-loaded INVs, CTZ-loaded NLC, CTZ-loaded INVs combined with NAC, CTZ-loaded NLC combined with NAC, CTZ alone, and aqueous solution of CTZ and NAC) inhibited the formation of P. aeruginosa Figure 12 103 104 28 3.9.3.

In Vivo Assessment of Selected Optimized INV Formula Based on the ex vivo studies and microbiological assessments of the optimized formulae, one of the two noncarriers was selected for in vivo assessment. Although both formulae, in the presence of NAC, reduced the MIC and MBC to 1 and 2 μg/mL, respectively, as compared to 8 and 16 μg/mL exhibited by the drug solution, the optimized CTZ-loaded INVs exhibited a larger amount of drug permeated and deposited across the corneal tissue (970.85 ± 0.97 and 105 µg/cm 2 2 3.10.1. Microbiological Assessment The baseline microbial count in the infected groups was 3 × 10 5 7 3 5 2 p P. aeruginosa 3.10.2. Histopathology Study The histopathological examination of the corneal tissue showed that the cornea in Gp1 exhibited a normal histological structure, including the epithelium and stroma, while the positive group, GP2, demonstrated the complete sloughing of the corneal epithelium, with the infiltration of the stroma by a high number of inflammatory cells—mainly neutrophils and lymphocytes ( Figure 14 3.10.3. Immunohistochemistry Assay The immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated findings that confirmed those of the histopathological examination, where the negative control (Gp1) showed the negative expression of caspase 3 and IL1β in the corneal epithelium and stroma. In contrast, the positive group (Gp2) showed strong positive expression for caspase 3 and IL1β in the corneal epithelium and stroma. Gp3 and Gp4 showed mild positive expression for caspase 3 and IL1 β in the corneal epithelium and stroma. Gp5 demonstrated findings similar to Gp1, showing the negative expression of caspase 3 and IL1β in the corneal epithelium and stroma. Finally, Gp6 showed, to some extent, strong positive expression for caspase 3 and IL1β in the corneal epithelium and stroma, as illustrated in Figure 15 Figure 16 In the current study, two simple and scalable nanocarriers were investigated and optimized to select the optimal nanocarrier for the delivery of CTZ across corneal tissues to treat keratitis induced by P. aeruginosa. Potential limitations of the current research work include the inherent variability in the clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa 105 106 107 4. Conclusions In the current study, two different nanocarriers, namely invasomes and nanostructured lipid carriers, have been developed and optimized to achieve an optimal formula for the incorporation of ceftazidime. Both systems showed acceptable features in terms of entrapment efficiency, particle size, homogeneity, and stability. Furthermore, both formulae exhibited enhanced antibacterial activity, especially in the presence of N-acetylcysteine; however, the invasomal formula demonstrated higher permeation capabilities, as confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Therefore, the ceftazidime-loaded invasomal formula combined with N-acetylcysteine demonstrated superior antibacterial activity throughout the in vivo studies. These results highlight the viability of non-antibiotic adjunct therapies in optimizing antimicrobial regimens while mitigating the development of resistance. However, safety and toxicity evaluations of the fabricated nanocarrier in relevant ocular models are required to confirm its biocompatibility.
