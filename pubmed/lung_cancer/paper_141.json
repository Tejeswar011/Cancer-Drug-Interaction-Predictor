Objective Despite the increasing interest in radiogenomic prediction, few studies have directly compared the performance of logistic regression and decision tree models in distinguishing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation subtypes. This study provides the first systematic comparison of the predictive performance of these two models in identifying exon 19 deletions (19Del) and exon 21 L858R point mutations (21L858R) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. By leveraging imaging and clinical parameters, we aimed to address a critical gap in the literature by establishing an optimal prediction model and providing a noninvasive tool to support personalized treatment strategies for patients with unknown EGFR mutation status. Materials and methods We retrospectively collected clinical and radiological data from 193 patients with histologically confirmed lung adenocarcinoma who were admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between May 2018 and June 2024. Based on EGFR genotyping results, patients were stratified into two groups: the EGFR 19Del mutation group and the EGFR 21L858R mutation group. Comparative statistical analyses—including Student’s t U Results In the decision tree model, age and brain metastasis emerged as key decision nodes for differentiating 19Del and 21L858R mutations, with an AUC of 0.712 (95% CI: 0.639–0.785). In contrast, the logistic regression model identified age, pleural thickening, lymphadenopathy, and brain metastasis as independent predictors, achieving a higher AUC of 0.740 (95% CI: 0.671–0.810). The NRI and IDI values were 0.498 ( P P P Conclusion Both logistic regression and decision tree models demonstrated value in predicting EGFR 19Del and 21L858R mutations in lung adenocarcinoma, each offering distinct methodological advantages. The logistic regression model exhibited higher interpretability and statistical robustness, making it well-suited for clinical decision-making. Meanwhile, the decision tree model offered superior visual clarity and intuitive structure, which may enhance practical utility. A combined modeling approach that harnesses the strengths of both methods may provide a more accurate and comprehensive tool for early mutation identification and individualized treatment planning in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

However, this invasive procedure is associated with potential complications such as hemorrhage, infection, and pneumothorax. Moreover, due to intratumoral heterogeneity, small biopsy samples may not fully reflect the genomic landscape of the entire tumor ( 12 With the rapid evolution of medical imaging technologies, radiological assessment has emerged as an essential tool not only for diagnosis and treatment monitoring but also for exploring molecular correlates through imaging biomarkers ( 13 15 16 17 2 Materials and methods 2.1 General information This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (Approval No. YX2023-212), with the requirement for written informed consent waived. A total of 1,200 patients with pathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinoma and documented epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations were initially screened. These patients were diagnosed and treated at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between November 2018 and June 2024. The inclusion criteria were as follows: histopathological diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma; presence of EGFR mutations limited to exon 19 deletions (19Del) or exon 21 L858R point mutations (21L858R) as determined by gene testing; availability of preoperative chest CT scan data; no history of other malignancies; no history of preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Exclusion criteria included: incomplete clinical information (e.g., gender, age, smoking history); receipt of any treatment prior to surgery; time interval exceeding one month between the preoperative CT scan and surgical resection; missing EGFR mutation subtype results; The CT image quality is poor, making it difficult to determine the tumor lesions. Ultimately, 193 patients with lung adenocarcinoma EGFR mutation subtypes were included in this study. The screening process is shown in the figure (  Figure 1 Figure 1 Flow chart of case enrollment. Flowchart outlining the selection process for lung adenocarcinoma patients from November 2018 to June 2024. Initially, 1,200 patients were considered. Exclusions based on criteria such as lack of clinical data, preoperative treatment, and unavailable tumor gene test results reduced the number to 341 eligible patients. Further exclusions related to EGFR mutation status led to 193 patients meeting the final inclusion criteria. 2.2 CT scan parameters All patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scanning using a SOMATOM Force 128-slice scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). The imaging protocol was standardized as follows: tube voltage was set at 120 kV, with a tube current ranging from 150 to 200 mA. The display field of view (DFOV) was 350 mm. Axial images were acquired with a slice thickness and interslice gap of 5 mm. For image reconstruction, a slice thickness of 1.25 mm and a reconstruction interval of 1.25 mm were applied, with a matrix size of 512 × 512. These parameters ensured optimal spatial resolution for the assessment of pulmonary and mediastinal structures. 2.3 CT image interpretation Following communication and approval from the hospital’s administrative and medical records departments, clinical case data were retrieved through the institution’s electronic medical record system. Computed tomography (CT) images were independently reviewed by two board-certified radiologists, each with five years of diagnostic experience. During the image interpretation process, both radiologists were blinded to the patients’ clinical data and mutation status to minimize bias. Interobserver agreement for qualitative CT features was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa statistic, with detailed results provided in Supplementary Material  Supplementary Table S1 2.4 Detection of EGFR mutations in tumor specimens EGFR mutation analysis was conducted in the Department of Pathology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. Mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene were detected using the PCR-ARMS (amplification refractory mutation system) technique with a commercially available human EGFR mutation detection kit (Beijing SinoMD Gene Detection Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Cases harboring exon 19 deletions were classified as the EGFR 19Del mutation group, while those exhibiting the exon 21 L858R point mutation were assigned to the EGFR 21L858R mutation group. 2.5 Statistical analysis methods Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), with a two-tailed P-value < 0.05 considered indicative of statistical significance. For continuous variables, the independent samples t-test was applied to data with a normal distribution, while the Mann–Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed data. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Variables demonstrating statistical significance (P < 0.05) in univariate analyses were subsequently entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors associated with 19Del and 21L858R mutations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. A classification-based decision tree algorithm was employed to construct the decision tree model, with node splitting based on chi-square values. Internal validation was conducted via 10-fold cross-validation to assess model robustness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for both the logistic regression and decision tree models, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated to evaluate predictive performance. Comparative analyses between the two models were further conducted using the DeLong test, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) metrics. 3 Results 3.1 Clinical and imaging characteristics of patients Patients with the EGFR 21L858R mutation exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of pleural thickening and brain metastasis compared to those with the EGFR 19Del mutation (P < 0.05). Conversely, lymphadenopathy was more frequently observed in the EGFR 19Del mutation group (P < 0.05). Additionally, age was found to be negatively associated with the presence of EGFR 19Del mutation. However, no statistically significant differences were identified between the two groups in terms of general clinical characteristics (e.g., sex, smoking history) or CT imaging features, including tumor type, location, maximum diameter, lobulation, and other morphological signs (P > 0.05), as detailed in  Table 1 Table 1 Association between clinical and CT imaging features and EGFR 19Del or 21L858R mutations.

Flowchart showing a decision tree for EGFR mutation subtypes: 19Del and 21L858R. Node 0 splits by age (<=69, >69) with adjusted p-value of 0.000. Node 1, with brain metastases absent, has 56.1% 19Del and 43.9% 21L858R. Node 2, without brain metastases, has 24.6% 19Del and 75.4% 21L858R. Node 3 (absent) and Node 4 (present) show percentages of subtypes with respective outcomes and adjusted p-values. among patients aged ≤69 years, 56.1% exhibited the EGFR 19Del mutation and 43.9% the EGFR 21L858R mutation; among those aged >69 years, 24.6% had the EGFR 19Del mutation, while 75.4% had the EGFR 21L858R mutation. Further analysis revealed that for patients aged ≤69 years without brain metastases (node 3), 37% presented with the EGFR 19Del mutation and 63% with the EGFR 21L858R mutation. Conversely, in patients with brain metastases (node 4), 45.1% had the 19Del mutation, and 54.9% had the 21L858R mutation. 3.4 Comparison of the predictive performance and diagnostic efficacy of the two models The area under the curve (AUC) of the decision tree model and logistic regression model for identifying EGFR 19Del and 21L858R mutations were 0.712 (95% CI = 0.639-0.785) and 0.740 (95% CI = 0.671-0.810), respectively.

Among EGFR mutations, exon 19 deletions (19Del) and the exon 21 L858R point mutation (21L858R) represent the two most prevalent subtypes, together accounting for the vast majority of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas ( 18 19 20 21 22 24 Both modeling approaches identified age and presence of brain metastasis as key predictors of EGFR mutation subtype. Consistent with prior literature, our results indicate that patients with EGFR 19Del mutation tend to be younger than those with EGFR 21L858R mutation ( 25 26 27 In addition, the logistic regression model identified pleural thickening and lymphadenopathy as significant predictors. Our findings concur with those of Zhang et al. ( 28 29 30 31 Despite these methodological differences, both models demonstrated utility in predicting EGFR mutation subtype. The logistic regression model identified four explanatory variables, whereas the decision tree model selected two. Both consistently highlighted age and brain metastasis as the most influential predictors. In terms of performance, the logistic regression model yielded an AUC of 0.740 (95% CI: 0.671–0.810), slightly outperforming the decision tree model (AUC = 0.712; 95% CI: 0.639–0.785). Net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analyses further supported the superior classification performance of the logistic regression model (NRI = 0.498, P = 0.001; IDI = 0.043, P = 0.004). However, DeLong’s test showed no statistically significant difference between AUCs (Z = 1.314, P = 0.189), suggesting that while logistic regression may offer nuanced advantages in certain contexts, both models are comparably effective overall. The discrepancy in statistical significance across performance metrics reflects their differing emphases: while NRI and IDI capture shifts in classification performance, particularly for individuals near decision thresholds, the DeLong test evaluates overall discriminative capacity. Therefore, integrating both modeling strategies may offer complementary strengths, enhancing predictive accuracy and clinical utility. Notwithstanding these promising findings, several limitations warrant acknowledgment. First, this retrospective analysis focused exclusively on CT imaging and select clinical parameters, potentially omitting other relevant variables. Second, despite employing a double-blind approach to radiological interpretation, selection bias may have influenced the observed associations. Most importantly, while robust internal validation was performed through cross-validation techniques (applied to the decision tree model), the lack of external validation represents a key limitation that may affect the generalizability of our results. This constraint, common in radiomics studies, highlights the critical need for future prospective multicenter validation to confirm the clinical applicability of our models. In summary, logistic regression and decision tree models constructed using age, lymphadenopathy, pleural thickening, and brain metastasis show promise for noninvasive prediction of EGFR 19Del and 21L858R mutation subtypes in lung adenocarcinoma. These models may inform genotype-tailored treatment decisions, facilitate early identification of high-risk patients, and ultimately improve prognostic assessment in clinical practice.
