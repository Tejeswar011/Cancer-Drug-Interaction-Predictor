Despite this, effective diagnostic and therapeutic options remain limited, prompting an urgent need for novel translational strategies. Gene-based therapeutics have emerged as a promising solution compared to conventional treatments. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of delivering nucleic acid drugs using nanoengineered materials, which take advantage of the liver’s unique anatomical and physiological characteristics. We overview the liver physiology and function, and the underlying mechanisms of gene therapy—including gene augmentation, gene silencing, and gene editing. Special attention is given to current strategies and mechanisms of gene therapy. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical translation, benefits, and limitations of gene-based approaches in treating the most widespread liver diseases and pathologies such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatic inflammation, hepatitis, and fibrosis. By addressing the current challenges and opportunities, this review underscores the transformative potential of nanoengineered gene therapeutics in advancing liver disease treatment and shaping the future of precision hepatology.

It discusses liver physiology, immunology and regeneration, highlighting molecular mechanisms and translational potential. Special attention is given to therapeutic approaches for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatic inflammation, hepatitis and fibrosis, emphasizing the promise of precision genomic medicine in hepatology. Introduction The liver has a number of key physiological functions, including nutrient metabolism, lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, antioxidant defense, synthesis of coagulation factors, regulation of blood volume, synthesis of elements of the immune response, and endocrine control of growth signaling pathways [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Standard methods of treating liver pathology remain insufficient. The main reason is the complexity of each liver disease, with many possible targets for therapy. In addition, since the liver is essential for the homeostasis of the entire body, inadequately selected therapy is fraught with the risk of developing systemic diseases, and even multiple organ failure and death. In this regard, liver disease therapy should be comprehensive, treating the pathology itself, stimulating liver regeneration, and restoring liver function. A promising alternative to the conventional liver treatment approaches is gene-based therapeutics such as delivery of DNA and RNA aimed at restoring/suppressing gene function. The latter include oligonucleotides and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) [ 8 1 9 10 11 14 Fig. 1 A schematic overview of genomic medicine approaches for the treatment of NAFLD, viral hepatitis and liver fibrosis Generally, viral delivery systems of gene therapeutics, which include adeno-associated virus (AAV), adenovirus (AdV), lentivirus (LV) and γ-RV based ones, are currently most used in clinics. The main advantage of viral vectors is undoubtedly the efficiency of gene delivery. However, viral delivery systems suffer from a number of limitations: viral vectors have a low packaging capacity and should be produced in accordance with GMP regulations, which demands expensive equipment and highly trained personnel. This results in large production expenses and high final cost of the product [ 15 16 Non-viral delivery systems of gene therapeutics are generally represented by organic or inorganic nanomaterials, which have a number of benefits compared to viral delivery systems. Nanoparticle (NP) carriers can be imparted with certain functions, for example, contrast properties for tracking the particles in vivo, or provide site-specific or cytosolic delivery of genes [ 17 20 21 23 In this review, we analyze mechanisms for gene therapy of liver pathological conditions such as NAFLD, inflammation, hepatitis, and fibrosis. We provide a comprehensive guide to current strategies of liver therapy and discuss their advantages, bottlenecks, and future perspectives of gene therapeutics for liver treatment. Liver physiology and immunology The liver has a central role in metabolism of nutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) and removal of metabolic wastes [ 24 25 26 27 28 The main functional unit (module) of the liver is the hepatic lobule [ 29 13 30 31 32 33 35 Hepatobiliary elimination usually occurs through the following pathway: from the bloodstream to (1) liver sinusoid, (2) space of Disse, (3) hepatocytes, (4) bile ducts, (5) intestines, and (6) out of the body (Fig. 2 36 37  Fig. 2 Schematic representation of mechanisms of NP biodistribution in different types of liver cells: HSC, hepatic stellate cells; LSEC, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells The liver is a lymphoid organ with unique immunological properties, particularly its predominant innate immune system. The cellular composition of the liver is distinct from that of peripheral lymphoid organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and other tissues. It includes Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), natural killer T (NKT) cells, γδ T cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, all of which function to maintain liver homeostasis [ 38 40 41 42 43 44 45 Mechanisms of gene therapy Currently, numerous liver-specific gene therapy approaches are under investigation or in clinical development. In recent years, a lot of efforts have been made in developing in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy solutions for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, from haploinsufficiency therapy and treatment of inherited metabolic diseases to immune deficiencies, blood disorders, solid tumors, and neurological disorders [ 46 57 Gene augmentation Methods used for gene augmentation are often discussed in the context of gene replacement therapy (delivering a functional copy of a gene to replace a nonfunctional gene). However, these methods can also be used to overexpress a gene. In this regard, here we use the term gene augmentation. Gene augmentation therapy is an attractive alternative to classical methods such as growth factor therapy or enzyme replacement therapy. In some cases, a small percentage of hepatocytes carrying a genetic construct with a functional gene is required to achieve clinically significant improvements [ 58 59 In the case of gene augmentation strategy, genetic material can be delivered either as DNA for long-term maintenance of function or as RNA for short-term expression and augmentation of a gene (Fig. 3 60 61 62 63 Fig. 3 Overview of nucleic acid-based therapeutics aimed at long-term or transient gene augmentation. The modern methods allow achieving long-term constitutive expression of genes necessary for the correction of haploinsufficiency and gene replacement therapy; they include approaches such as transient hyperexpression, modulating translation efficiency, modifying the primary and secondary structure of mRNA, and increasing the stability of the introduced construct by transforming it into circRNA or self-amplifying RNA to avoid the risk of insertional mutagenesis To overcome the disadvantages associated with transgene elimination, stabilizing sequences can be applied. Generally, stabilizing sequences can be used such as scaffold matrix attachment regions (S/MARs), which are genomic DNA sequences that link chromatin to the nuclear matrix during interphase and are involved in DNA replication and transcription [ 64 65 An alternative approach is to insert the expression cassette into the host DNA using lentiviral vectors, gene editing nucleases, and transposons. Transgene stabilization can also be achieved using the transposons Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB), which integrate the expression cassette into the host cell genome at transposase-specific sites [ 66 67 16 The use of mRNA reduces the likelihood of insertional mutagenesis, and the short half-life makes therapeutic mRNAs well-suited for applications requiring transient effects, such as RNA vaccines and short-term gene augmentation. The LNP-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, tozinameran and elasomeran, have been a landmark achievement for RNA in medicine, successfully used to vaccinate billions of people worldwide against SARS-CoV-2 to prevent COVID-19 [ 68 69 70 PCCA/PCCB 71 The intracellular stability of mRNA can be improved by modification of secondary structure and the use of base modifications including pseudouridine, N1-methylpseudouridine, and 5-methylcytosine, which in turn improves the protein production. When delivering mRNA as gene therapeutics, protein levels reach their maximum within 6–48 h after mRNA administration [ 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 Another approach used for gene augmentation is the use of small activating RNAs (saRNAs), which was first described in 2006 [ 80 81 Gene silencing Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a mechanism for suppressing gene expression at the level of mature mRNA, involving translational inhibition and/or mRNA degradation, but not affecting their transcriptional activity. The two most common PTGS methods include RNA interference (RNAi) (Fig. 4 82 83 Fig. 4 Various RNaseH- and RISC-based gene silencing approaches ASO technology is one of the first approaches to use oligonucleotides for therapeutic purposes [ 84 85 86 87 88 Non-cleaving ASOs can also alter translation and RNA stability by targeting critical post-transcriptional regulatory sites [ 89 90 91 92 An alternative strategy aimed at gene-specific silencing is the use of siRNAs, which use the endogenous RNA interference pathway and often demonstrate a more pronounced suppression of the target gene [ 93 93 94 95 96 97 98 Breakthrough advances in the field of chemical modification of siRNA have reduced its toxicity and immunogenicity of RNA oligonucleotides, increased their stability, and improved cellular uptake by hepatocytes [ 99 100 101 Alternative siRNA designs that increase silencing efficiency by integrating the delivered molecules into the processing machinery are also being considered. Small interfering RNAs, which are processed by the endoribonuclease Dicer similarly to endogenous microRNAs, are an alternative to conventional 21-mer siRNAs, with an efficiency increased up to 10-fold compared to traditional constructs [ 102 103 104 105 106 Unfortunately, the use of siRNA and microRNA as therapeutic agents for various pathological conditions is hampered by their challenging systemic delivery in vivo and potential off-target effects. Major limitations include the instability and relatively short half-life of microRNA in the blood circulation, limited cellular uptake, instability within endosomal compartments of a cell, and limited presence in the cytosol. Although several modifications of siRNA structure have been studied to improve siRNA stability, the mentioned problems have not been adequately resolved. Therefore, the development of specific microRNA carriers is of great importance [ 107 Gene editing therapy Gene editing tools have advanced significantly in recent decades, creating new opportunities to treat many genetic disorders [ 108 109 110 111 114 115 116 To date, gene editing technologies have passed three key development milestones: zinc finger nucleases (ZFN); transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN); and the most widely used third-generation gene editing technology – clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) (Fig. 5 117 119 Streptococcus pyogenes 115 120 Fig. 5 Schematic overview of gene editing strategies: A B C Although each nuclease follows its own distinctive strategy, they all search for specific genomic sequences and target the region to induce double-strand DNA breaks (DSB), which will then be repaired by non-homologous end joining repair (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). Possible gene editing mechanisms also include homology-independent targeted integration (HITI), base editing, prime editing, and nuclease-free homologous recombination [ 121 122 123 124 α-Gal 125 126 Targeted delivery of gene editors remains a limiting factor for most in vivo and ex vivo gene editing applications. In particular, not only safe, specific, and efficient delivery of CRISPR components to target cells, but also the immunogenicity of CRISPR components and their vectors is challenging [ 127 128 129 ARCUS endonucleases have demonstrated high levels of editing at various target sites in numerous models [ 130 134 Since DSBs can potentially cause genotoxicity issues, nucleases are also engineered to perform single-stranded nicks (e.g., nickase Cas9 (nCas9)) or to be catalytically inactive (e.g., dead Cas9 (dCas9)). These modified Cas9s have been fused with deaminases, retrotranscriptases (RT), transcription activators, or silencing proteins to produce safer genetic or epigenetic modifications [ 135 136 137 138 139 138 140 Dnmt1 Pah enu2 −1 141 Epigenetic editors also demonstrate high therapeutic potential [ 142 143 Pcsk9 ( Pcsk9 144 Discussion: current limitations and research directions of genomic medicine In the last decade, various gene therapy drugs targeting the liver have been actively investigated to correct a wide range of hereditary and acquired diseases (including metabolic diseases [ 62 145 147 148 152 Immunogenicity of genomic medicine components Immune response is a serious challenge in the development of drugs based on genomic medicine, since unmodified NAs can elicit a strong innate immune response accompanied by the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Currently, approaches based on chemical modification of NAs, bioinformatic algorithms for identifying immunogenic sequences, and a number of other strategies are successfully applied to reduce immunogenicity [ 153 154 155 156 Components of gene editing system also could be immunogenic. Specifically, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to both SaCas9 ( S. aureus S. pyogenes 157 Ruminococcus flavefaciens 158 159 Problems and prospects of delivery systems As mentioned earlier, the use of viral delivery systems is limited by a number of issues, including immune response to a first AAV administration, seroprevalence in patients, loss of the expression cassette in actively dividing cells, and production of NAbs. In particular, NAbs recognizing most serotypes can be found in the majority of subjects (according to various estimates, from 60 to 70% in different regions) due to the broad cross-reactivity between AAV serotypes [ 160 160 161 Modularity and flexibility make LNP-mRNA-based drugs one of the most promising platforms attracting large investments, but nevertheless, a large number of issues arise related to the logistics of an unstable RNA drug, the industrial scaling, safety testing and effectiveness of the platform (to get acquainted with the proposed solutions and directions of development of mRNA-LNP drugs such as LNP chemistry, production methods and some commercial aspects, we suggest following reviews [ 162 164 165 167 73 168 165 Since the liver has high spatial and functional heterogeneity, it is important to consider the target characteristics, preventing off-target effects, for example, caused by ectopic expression. Thus, in the liver of mice and dogs, AAV transduction occurs predominantly in the pericentral regions, in non-human primates - in the periportal regions, and in humans, the site of AAV transduction remains unknown [ 169 170 171 Another aspect to consider is the formation of a protein corona, which surrounds the carrier and requires additional efforts to prevent or control its formation. А complex, dynamic, multi-component protein corona can promote opsonization and accelerated clearance of carriers, masking surface ligands, and reducing the effectiveness of targeted delivery [ 172 175 176 177 180 181 183 Regardless of the delivery method and modality, improving endosomal release (also known as endosomal escape) would greatly enhance the efficacy of an RNA drug, but is very difficult to achieve without encountering toxicity or deterioration of other beneficial characteristics of the carrier [ 20 184 184 187 Above, we discussed some of the challenges and directions of genomic medicine development. Despite the availability of approved platforms, delivery systems remain a bottleneck for various modalities of therapy. In Table 1  Table 1 Comparative characteristics of viral and non-viral platforms Feature Viral Vectors (e.g., AAV, LV) Non-Viral Vectors (e.g., LNPs, polymer- and metal-based NP, chemical conjugation) Delivery Efficiency High. Highly efficient at entering hepatocytes and delivering cargo. Low to Moderate. Historically lower efficiency, but LNP and GalNAc-conjugates show effective liver targeting. Duration of Gene Expression Long-term to Permanent. AAVs provide sustained expression for years in non-dividing hepatocytes. Transient. Expression is temporary. Requires repeat dosing for chronic effects, but suitable for acute therapies. Risk of Genomic Integration Low (AAV) to High (LV). Risk of insertional mutagenesis poses a long-term safety concern. Very Low to Negligible. Do not actively integrate, offering a superior safety profile. Immunogenicity & Hepatotoxicity High. Can trigger immune responses causing transaminitis and, rarely, severe liver injury. Pre-existing immunity is a major barrier. Low. Synthetic nature confers lower immunogenicity, enabling repeat administration with reduced risk of significant inflammation. Payload/Cargo Capacity Limited. Constrained by capsid size (e.g., AAV: ~4.7 kb). Large and Versatile. Can carry very large genes, multiple genes, or different types of cargo (DNA, mRNA, ASOs). Manufacturing Complexity & Cost High. Complex, biological process. Very expensive, limiting use to rare diseases. Low to Moderate. Simpler, synthetic process. More scalable and less expensive, enabling application to common diseases. Suitability for Repeat Dosing Poor. Immune response induction typically blocks re-administration. Good. Low immunogenicity allows for repeat treatments to manage chronic liver conditions. Artificial intelligence for the development of genomic medicine The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the development of genomic medicine is revolutionizing the field. AI tools offer a promising approach for predicting stability and immunogenicity while simultaneously monitoring delivery system design and side effects. The AI-based approach has already been successfully applied to create modified delivery systems based on LNP [ 188 191 192 194 195 197 97 198 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 Comorbidities as a problem for the implementation of targeted genomic therapy Liver pathology often arises not as an independent disease but as a manifestation of systemic disorder. This also needs to be taken into account, since the targets and principles for therapy in this case change dramatically. As an example, liver disease is the leading cause of death in patients with hemophilia [ 171 209 210 211 212 Treatment of liver pathological conditions using gene therapeutics There are many diagnostic and therapeutic drugs for pathological conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatitis, and fibrosis (or its decompensated form – cirrhosis). However, for the successful development of liver disease therapy, it is necessary to take into account that the pathogenesis of any chronic disease is regulated by many autocrine and paracrine signals [ 27 213 214 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) NAFLD is one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide. The risk of developing NAFLD increases in case of obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or insulin resistance [ 215 216 In June 2023, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress announced the new nomenclatures MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis) and MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) to replace NASH and NAFLD, respectively [ 217 218 220 Lipotoxicity and inflammatory reactions contribute to the progression of NAFLD to NASH [ 221 222 de novo 223 224 225 227 6 2+ 228 229 Fig. 6 Schematic illustration of pathophysiology of NAFLD: impaired regulation of de novo To date, there are no effective approaches to the treatment of NAFLD and NASH in the clinic, which makes the development of new therapeutic approaches particularly relevant. The cornerstone of NAFLD treatment is lifestyle modification and diet aimed at normalization of lipid metabolism and overall weight loss. Currently, there is only one approved pharmacotherapy for NAFLD – the THR-β agonist resmetirom. Several other classes of pharmacological agents have demonstrated efficacy in terms of histological improvement in steatosis or steatohepatitis, such as pioglitazone and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, but they have not been approved by the FDA [ 230 There are two main strategies on which methods proposed for the treatment of NAFLD and NASH are based. The first one is modulation of the initial mechanism of pathogenesis: decreasing lipid infiltration of hepatocytes by reducing de novo 231 236 2 237 238  Table 2 Clinical trials of gene therapeutics for NAFLD treatment Inventor Product Delivery system Target Status Clinical trial Results Eli Lilly LY3885125 GalNAc-siRNA  SCAP Phase 1 (Terminated) NCT06007651 Data not available Ionis Pharmaceuticals ION224 GalNAc-ASO  DGAT2 Phase 2 NCT04932512 at least a 2-point reduction in NAFLD Activity Score (NAS); 32% of patients treated with 120 mg achieved a ≥ 1 stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening steatohepatitis as measured by biopsy compared to 12.5% for placebo.

NAFLD progresses largely due to dysregulation of transcription factors regulating lipogenesis such as Forkhead box A3 (FOXA3), sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), and others. FOXA3 is crucial in lipid and glucose homeostasis in the liver and other tissues. FOXA3 levels are elevated in the liver of obese mice and patients with NAFLD [ 239 240 FOXA3 241 SREBPs are transcription factors regulating the biogenesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides (TG) [ 242 de novo 101 243 244 246 NCT06007651 SCAP SERBP1c 247 SREBP2 SREBP1 CROT HADHB 248 ABCA1 ABCB11 ABCG5 ABCB4 ATP8B1 CYP7A1 249 250 251 252 7 253 254 Fig. 7 Multifaceted evaluation of miR-33 antagomir-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (miR-MSNs) for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH: A B C D E F G H 252 FOXA3 and SREBPs activate a wide range of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and others.

Targeting these proteins has shown promising results in alleviating NAFLD and improving insulin sensitivity. For example, targeting miR-132, which regulates PTEN FOXO3 SIRT1 351 352 FGF21 PPARα SIRT1 PGC-1α 353 354 353 355 Klf11 356 357 Inflammation Macrophage polarization and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling are components of the inflammatory response contributing to progression of NASH; related approaches are currently being investigated for the treatment of inflammation in NAFLD. Several microRNAs have been identified as regulators of TLR signaling, including miR-181-3p, miR-146b, miR-140, miR-204-3p, and miR-16 [ 358 363 364 TNF-α IL-6 8 365 TLR9 366 367 SCAP SCAP 368 369 TNF-α a-SMA COL1A1 Fig. 8 Anti-inflammatory effects of miR-146b mimic delivered via lactosylated nanoparticles: A B C D E p p p F 364 Tripathi et al.

Although monotherapy based on the THR-β agonist Resmetirom has been approved by the FDA for MASH treatment [ 217 384 385 386 NCT03776175 387 Population genetics has made a huge contribution to identifying targets for the control of lipid metabolism in MASLD, expand horizons for the development of siRNA, ASO, and small molecules to suppress various targets, including PNPLA3, HSD17B13, MTARC1, GPAM, PSD3 and CIDEB [ 388 389 Also, it is necessary to take into account the complex and dynamic nature of the pathology. If at the initial stages of the progression of MASD the control of metabolic changes is most applicable, but then the pathology progresses, therapy should be aimed at resorption of fibrosis and prevention of hepatocyte death. A good example is the dynamics of the activity of SREBP, a key modulator of lipogenesis. As a master regulator of the DNL pathway SREBP1 exhibited a significant increase in MASLD patients [ 390 391 392 393 395 Hepatitis Another widespread liver disease is viral hepatitis, which includes several types, A, B, C and D. Currently, successful treatment has been achieved only for the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is a major risk factor for the development ofliver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, patients are prescribed protease inhibitors, Such as sofosbuvir, simeprevir, and faldaprevir. The effectiveness of the therapy is quite high, 45–90% (varying for patients with different genotypes of the virus), but treatment is time-consuming and accompanied by adverse effects (flu-like symptoms, anemia); in addition, the production of drugs is quite expensive [ 396 398 There is no effective treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The major curing strategies include interferons and nucleosi(t)de analogues, which are not suitable for long-term use due to serious side effects. The urgent need for novel HBV treatments has driven extensive research efforts in research institutes and pharmaceutical industry [ 399 400 9 401  Fig. 9 Schematic representation of the life cycle of the hepatitis C and B viruses, illustrating key steps that are targets for therapy Inhibition of virus entry into hepatocytes The key stage of both primary and persistent infection is the penetration of the virus into the cell. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) with high efficacy and high specificity have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of HBV. The majority of clinically effective NAbs target viral envelope proteins to prevent the virus from entering the host cell [ 402 403 404 405 The use of ligands specific to receptors mediating viral penetration not only facilitates targeted drug delivery to infected cells, but also reduces viral internalization by saturating the receptor. Gao et al. [ 406 407 As for HCV, the virus enters hepatocytes through a multi-step process that requires a number of host cellular factors (including CD81, Class B type I scavenger receptor (SRBI), claudin-1 (CLDN), occludin (OCLN), and viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 [ 408 DNA aptamers (small single-stranded oligonucleotides) specific for HCV E2 glycoprotein developed by Chen et al.

Treatment with PLK1 inhibitors had a suppressive effect on the HBV replication [ 452 453 PLK1 Since HCV does not integrate into the genome of an infected cell or form stable epistomal elements, it can be effectively eliminated by blocking viral replication [ 454 455 PRK2 456 457 10  Fig. 10 Targeted silencing of HCV core protein via VE-decorated dendrimeric siRNA delivery: A B C D E p 456 Several microRNA (miR-196, miR-296, miR-351, miR-431,miR-199a, let-7,miR-181c, and miR-448) are able to inhibit the HCV replication by directly interacting with the HCV genome regions and HCV NS5A gene [ 458 459 460 461 462 463 465 466 11  Fig. 11 Efficient and long-term miR-122 inhibition by mPEG-PLGA-PLL nanoparticle-mediated delivery of antagomirs: A B C D E F G H 466 Therapeutics Miravirsen (SPC3649) is an LNA-modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotide inhibiting miR-122is undergoing phase IIa clinical trials ( NCT01200420 2 467 2 Suppression of hepatitis virustranslation All HBV transcripts, including subgenomic ones and pgRNA, share an identical 3’ end, which becomes a potential target for the simultaneous suppression of all viral transcripts via siRNA-mediated inhibition and ASO-induced degradation [ 401 468 469 3 470 Table 3 Clinical trials of gene therapeutics for hepatitis treatment Inventor Product Delivery system Target Status Clinical trial Results Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals ARC-520/ARC-521 Dynamic PolyConjugate (DPC) All HBV RNAs Terminated NCT02452528 Up to 2.6 log IU/mL HBsAg reduction in 2 patients and HBsAg seroclearance in 1 patient (HBeAg positive patients); 0.4 log IU/mL HBsAg reduction in 4 patients and HBsAg seroclearance in 1 patient; Suppression was maintained up to > 85 days NCT02577029 NCT02604212 NCT02065336 Arrowhead and Janssen JNJ-3989 TRiM™ GalNAc conjugation All HBV RNAs Phase I, IIa NCT04535544 Up to 2.6 log IU/mL HBsAg reduction; Suppression was Maintained up to 113 days NCT05275023 NCT04667104 NCT04439539 Arbutus Biopharma ARB-1467 LNP All HBV RNAs Phase IIa NCT02631096 Maximum individual HBsAg reduction of 2.7 log IU/mL; Suppression was Maintained up to 70 days Aligos Therapeutics ALG-125755 GalNAc conjugation HBV S region Phase I (Discontinued) NCT05561530 Up to 1.5 log IU/mL HBsAg reduction in mice Alnylam Pharmaceuticals VIR-2218 GalNAc conjugation siRNA ESC + HBV X region Phase II NCT04507269 Up to 2.55 log IU/mL HBsAg reduction; Suppression was Maintained up to 336 days NCT05484206 NCT06650852 NCT03672188 NCT06491563 NCT02826018 Arbutus Biopharma AB-729 GalNAc conjugation All HBV RNAs Phase IIa NCT04980482 Up to 2.16 log IU/mL HBsAg reduction; Suppression was Maintained up to 336 days NCT04820686 NCT04847440 Dicerna Pharmaceuticals RG-6346 GalXC GalNAc conjugation HBV S region Phase Ib, IIa NCT03772249 Up to 1.87 log IU/mL HBsAg reduction; Suppression was Maintained up to 448 days NCT04225715 NCT04225715 Suzhou Ribo Life Science RBD-1016 RIBO-GalSTAR™ GalNAc conjugation HBV X region Phase II NCT06649266 Up to 1.26 log IU/mL HBsAg reduction; Suppression was Maintained up to 168 days NCT05961098 Sino Biopharm TQA3038 GalNAc conjugation All HBV RNAs Phase Ib/IIa NCT06085053 Data not available NCT06452693 Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co.

VIR-2218 provided a sustained decrease in HBsAg for 48 weeks after treatment [ 477 478 NCT06649266 479 480 A notable result was achieved in a complex therapy consisting of siRNA JNJ-3989, core protein allosteric modulators (CpAM), and nucleose(t)id analogues. Among 12 people with chronic HBV, the treatment resulted in a significant decrease of viral markers such as HBsAg, HBV DNA, RNA, and HBcrAg by day 113 of therapy. This combined therapy was well tolerated without serious side effects [ 481 NCT04225715 482 483 ASOs for HBV therapy are also being actively developed. Bepirovirsen (previously ISIS 505358; GSK3228836) [ 484 485 486 NCT05630820 486 487 NCT03020745 488 486 Alternative approaches based on vectors carrying the primary-miR sequence are currently being actively studied. Primary-miR-31 targeting the HBx region was delivered using recombinant AAV, suppressing viral markers for at least 32 weeks without signs of toxicity or immunostimulation [ 489 490 491 An intriguing approach combining CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference used a triple cassette, gRNA-microRNA-gRNA, controlled by a single U6 promoter. pri-microRNA processing enzymes Drosha/DGCR8 cleave and generate two guide RNAs and pri-miR-31 for synergistic suppression of HBV. This strategy effectively suppressed HBV replication in vitro and in vivo and additionally disrupted HBV genomic DNA and cccDNA in vitro [ 492 The CRISPR/Cas approach is also used for HCV therapy. In a recent study, CRISPR/Cas13b targeted a highly conserved internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) HCV RNA, reducing HCV replication and viral protein translation in vitro [ 493 494 Capsid formation and virion secretion During HBV infection, subviral particles (SVP) are produced in large excess, depleting virus-neutralizing antibodies and reactive immune cells [ 495 496 497 498 NCT02233075 499 The HCV uses the biosynthetic pathway of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) to assemble and release viral particles from cells, which was comprehensively reviewed in [ 454 500 501 TM6SF2 502 503 Modification of T-lymphocytes as a strategy for suppressing HBV and HCV infections Functional treatment using new antiviral drugs is achieved Mainly in patients with low HBsAg levels and, consequently, in the immune control phase. Due to this, in most phase 2 trials of combination therapy against HBV, including siRNA or ASO with pharmacological HBV inhibitors (nucleos(t)ide analogues, CpAM, TLR7 agonist, and PEG-IFN), large proportion of patients experienced viral relapse after therapy. Thus, the lack of powerful components restoring immune depletion in new combinations against HBV may hinder their long-term effectiveness [ 475 504 Chronic infection leads to depletion or anergy of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Depleted CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are no longer effectively stimulated by their respective ligands, and there are elevated levels of co-inhibitory receptors, programmed death factor-1 (PD1), and pro-apoptotic molecules [ 505 Zai et al.[ 506 T cell engineering is a revolutionary strategy for restoring the function of HBV-specific T cells. A recent systematic review by Elena Morte-Romea [ 507 508 514 NCT04745403 NCT05195294 NCT06617000 NCT05417932 515 516 Some T-cell factors may interfere with the control of chronic HBV infection, for example, PD-1. PD-1 inhibitors and targeted therapy against HBV can act synergistically, suppressing HBV gene expression and significantly increasing the survival of HBV transgenic mice [ 517 518 519 PD-L1 520 PD-L1 NCT04225715 521 522 Discussion: current limitations and research directions of hepatitis treatment The current strategies based on siRNAs target conserved sequences in the overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) of the HBV genome. These regions show high homology (≥ 90%) across different genotypes of the virus. As a result, siRNA drugs often target the S and X reading frames of the hepatitis B virus [ 523 425 524 527 528 529 530 506 531 532 533 Given these limitations, CRISPR/Cas9 offers a more direct alternative by targeting the viral genome. Nevertheless, single gRNA for Cas9 cleavage may not be sufficient to completely inactivate HBV cccDNA [ 426 433 534 535 441 536 537 538 Theoretically, even a single copy of replication-competent cccDNA can lead to resumption of viremia after cessation of antiviral therapy. Thus, sustained suppression of HBV replication usually requires combination therapy, which should probably include immunomodulators to restore host immunity. Considering that immunotherapy has become the mainstream of modern HBV research, the combination of siRNA or CRISPR with immunomodulators is considered a promising avenue to improve the functional cure rate [ 482 539 Fibrosis Liver fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis in its advanced stages, develops in response to chronic liver damage of various origins. Fibrosis is characterized by excessive formation and deposition of ECM, including collagen [ 540 12 541 542 543 544  Fig. 12 Pathophysiological mechanisms of fibrosis development. Development of liver pathologies is associated with damage to hepatocytes, release of DAMP, proinflammatory mediators, and disruption of signal cascades. This activates HSCs, which begin to secrete cytokines that support their proliferation, activation, migration, and transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. An increase in the number of myofibroblasts, a shift in the balance between MMP and TIMPs, and increased production of ECM components leads to excessive deposition of ECM, increasing tissue stiffness and causing the development of hypoxia, which, in turn, also contribute to cellular stress and aggravate fibrosis There are two main approaches to antifibrotic therapy: (i) inhibition of HSCs’ activity coupled with treatment of inflammation, and (ii) resorption of fibrous tissue with restoration of tissue structure [ 545 546 Conventional pharmacological approaches for fibrosis therapy remain highly limited in addressing fibrosis itself, particularly when using monotherapy [ 547 548 549 550 551 552 NCT02548351 553 554 Given limitations of therapies targeting primary pathology, researchersare exploring new antifibrotic agents that directly target specific pro-mediators. These include pirfenidone ( NCT01046474 NCT05542615 NCT02466516 NCT01672853 555 556 557 558 Thus, new drugs must target multiple pathways. The first strategy can be achieved by modulating inflammatory signaling pathways associated with HSC activation. For instance, a number of studies revealed a link between inflammation, ER stress, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and activation of HSCs, largely due to the Notch pathway activation [ 559 560 561 Jag1 562 Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are also involved in the progression of liver fibrosis [ 563 565 566 568 569 570 565 571 572 573 574 IL11 or IL11ra1 369 13  Fig. 13 Oral delivery of TNF-α-siRNA via MTC-modified NPs alleviates hepatic inflammation and fibrosis: A B C D E 369 [ 575 CTGF 576 PDGFR TGF-β2 The second strategy is based on the regulation and resorption of excess ECM and collagen deposits in liver tissue. Several microRNAs, such as the let-7, miR-133a, miR-21, miR-378, miR-222, miR-30a, miR-24, miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-122 family, were reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, because they modulate the expression of fibrogenesis-related genes, Snail and the Fas ligand, as well as a wide range of other proteins involved in the progression of fibrosis [ 577 Among these microRNAs, miR-29b and miR-122 are the most promising therapeutic targets for liver fibrosis. The miR-29b and miR-122 inhibit collagen production by HSCs via targeting different specific signaling pathways of liver fibrosis. Moreover, it is anticipated that a combination of these two microRNAs may have an even larger synergistic antifibrotic effect [ 578 In detail, the miR-29b inhibits fibrogenesis by downregulating crucial regulators such as ECM proteins, indirectly blocking TGF-β1/Smad3 or hedgehog signaling pathway, and upregulating PTEN signaling cascade[ 579 580 578 581 COL1A1 PDGF-C 582 COL1A1 PDGFR β α SMA 583 14 Fig. 14 Enhanced accumulation and antifibrotic efficacy of RGD-conjugated nanoparticles in liver fibrosis models: A B C D E p p p 583 A large number of less studied microRNAs were described to be playing different roles during the progression of liver fibrosis. For example, overexpression of the miR-199 and miR-200 families was found to be positively correlated with the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway during liver fibrogenesis in both mouse and human fibrosis models [ 546 584 585 587 588 590 591 594 595 597 596 598 599 Some drugs against fibrosis are already in the clinical trials stage, e.g., vitamin A-coupled LNPs loaded with siRNA BMS-986,263 targeting Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47, collagen-specific chaperone expressed in HSCs) ( NCT02227459 600 NCT04267393 601 MMP-2 and MMP-14 are highly expressed in activated HSCs, promoting their migration and proliferation. MMP-2-siRNA delivered via vitamin A-linked liposome significantly reduced the expression of type I collagen and α-SMA in HSCs [ 602 545 HAS2 603 COL1Α1 TIMP-1 604 COL1A1 Jain et al. [ 605 COL1A1 In addition to approaches that rely on suppression of pro-fibrotic signaling, ECM deposition and maturation, delivery of transcriptional factors (such as HNF4A, FOXA2, HGF, etc.) and anti-fibrotic hormones such as relaxin (RLN) also holds promise ([ 606 HNF4A 607 608 FOXA2 FOXA2 4 609 610 611 HNF4α HGF FOXA2 4 612 613 614 615 616 Discussion: current limitations and research directions of fibrosis treatment Fibrosis is often considered not as an independent disease, but as a manifestation of chronic liver pathologies, in particular NASH or viral hepatitis. Therefore, alleviation of the underlying pathology can also leads to resolution of fibrosis. But, complexity of the pathogenesis of fibrosis leads to difficulties in developing therapy, which should effect not only fibrous tissue, but also normalize lipid metabolism and reduce cell death [ 617 619 620 621 622 Future prospects Each of the considered liver pathologies involves many processes, including metabolic, immunological, and molecular genetic changes, constituting a complex pathophysiological pattern. Identification of key issues underlying these processes and treating them is a major area of ​​modern research. Methods of targeted therapy based on gene therapeutics, such as gene silencing or editing, allow selective treatment of these key nodes, minimizing the impact on other vital processes. Therapeutic strategies based on a combination of genomic medicine approaches or combined with classical treatment approaches have shown a powerful synergistic effect, which opens up new horizons in the treatment of liver pathologies. The enormous progress achieved in genomic medicine and the constantly growing number of approved therapeutic approaches and new fundamental discoveries deepen the understanding of liver diseases and enable the emergence of effective therapeutic tools for the liver pathologies previously considered difficult to be completely cured.
