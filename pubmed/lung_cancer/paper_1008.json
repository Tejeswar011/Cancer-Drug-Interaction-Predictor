Cells employ DNA damage response through various repair mechanisms and DNA damage tolerance via translesion synthesis (TLS), to bypass DNA lesions and prevent replication fork collapse. This review explores the roles of human TLS polymerases in navigating replication stress, a critical process that can lead to genomic instability and cancer. It discusses TLS polymerase's dual role in genome preservation under certain physiological conditions while may also contribute to adaptive mutagenesis, highlighting their significance in DNA damage tolerance, somatic hypermutations, and cancer therapeutics. Understanding these mechanisms offers insights for developing targeted cancer therapies.

RS can arise from various sources, including increased firing of replication origins, conflicts between transcription and replication, and depletion of nucleotide pools. The DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA damage tolerance (DDT) are crucial mechanisms for maintaining genomic stability and preventing RS (Box 1). Pol η plays a crucial role in the error-free bypass of UV-induced CPD DNA damage, contributing to genome preservation and preventing the XP-V phenotype (Box 2). Additionally, Rev1 and other TLS polymerases play important roles in immune system maturation by assisting somatic hypermutations in lymphocytes (Box 2). Alternatively, DDT mechanisms involve translesion synthesis (TLS), template switching (TS), and repriming; together, these mechanisms prevent RS by avoiding replication fork collapse. TLS mechanisms are primarily facilitated by TLS polymerases Pol η, Pol ɩ, Pol κ, REV1, Pol θ, and Pol ζ. The access of TLS polymerases to the replication fork may lead to increased mutagenesis and genomic instability (Box 3) Fig. 2 RS and its ramifications response. Sources of RS include various DNA damages, such as DSBs, SSBs, abasic sites, inter- and intra-strand DNA crosslinks, and bulky adducts (Box 1). Additionally, RS can occur by DNA secondary structures, transcription-replication conflicts, and nucleotide pool exhaustion (Box 2). The DNA damage response (DDR) includes DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint activation, apoptosis, and senescence (Box 3) are responses of cells to deal with the RS. In homologous recombination proficient (+ HR) cells, DDR mechanisms such as template switching and fork reversal deal with fork impediments (Box 4). TS involves Rad6-RAD18 and UBC13 complex-mediated polyubiquitination (poly-Ub) of PCNA at lysine-63 residue and the downstream factors RAD51, Bloom syndrome protein (BLM), and Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 protein (NBS1), allowing the use of complementary base pairs to replicate DNA past the DNA obstacle (Box 4). Fork reversal employs the SMARCAL1, RAD51, ZRANB3, helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), and F-box DNA helicase 1 (FBH1) enzymes to facilitate replication fork remodeling into a four-way junction structure (Box 4). However, if DDR response fails or inadequately addresses the underlying RS then DNA damage tolerance (DDT) mechanisms are activated (Box 5). TLS can operate both + HR and -HR cells and that involves Rad6-RAD18-dependent mono-Ub of PCNA, which promotes downstream recruitment of TLS polymerases and DNA synthesis across the DNA lesion. Repriming relies on the action of DNA-directed primase/polymerase protein (PRIMPOL), leaving ssDNA gaps behind the replication forks to be filled post-replicative. PRIMPOL activity is regulated by ATR and Chk1 The TLS polymerases are expressed across all three domains of life, highlighting their critical and evolutionarily conserved role [ 36 Xeroderma pigmentosum 37 40 Xeroderma pigmentosum 41 42 12 28 TLS polymerases have crucial roles in the generation of antibody diversity Antibody diversity occurs by assembly of immunoglobulin variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments via non-homologous end joining [ 43 44 45 48 49 40 50 1 51 52 53 54 Human Pol η necessary to deal with UV-induced lesions in Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) cells and has roles in the regulation of ATM and ATR activity XP-V is an inherited disorder with an increased risk of sunlight-induced skin cancers. Unlike other Xeroderma pigmentosum 55 56 57 55 58 1 ATM and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) are essential protein kinases involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) and maintaining genomic stability [ 59 60 61 62 63 The function of Pol η shown to have a crucial role in regulating ATM to phosphorylate Chk2 and p53 after DNA damage [ 64 64 65 64 The interplay between Pol η and ATR involves a mutual regulation of their functions in response to DNA damage [ 66 67 64 17 64 66 69 TLS activity, cancer, and genome instability TLS polymerases and their regulatory mechanisms are often altered in cancer cells, with implications for cancer predisposition and progression. Evidence suggests that TLS activity supports the rapid survival of cancer cells even in the presence of oncogene-induced DNA RS [ 28 70 71 TLS roles in replication stress mitigation Cancer is driven by uncontrolled cell growth and genetic mutations, with oncogene-induced RS playing a key role in its development and progression [ 72 73 74 77 78 80 81 82 83 85 86 88 2 72 73 19 34 68 70 89 93 2 2 2 2 Roles of human Pol η Pol η is a specialized DNA polymerase that plays a crucial role in the DDT pathway, particularly in the context of human RS. Its primary function is to facilitate the bypass of UV-induced CPD DNA lesions during DNA replication, allowing the replication machinery to continue functioning despite the presence of damage in the DNA template. When the replication fork encounters a DNA lesion, such as CPD DNA lesions caused by UV radiation, the replicative DNA polymerases stall [ 94 95 96 96 98 99 100 29 101 102 Pol η activity is elevated in response to RS induced by various drugs and elevated Pol η forms intense foci throughout the nucleus in tumor cells, helping them navigate through RS [ 103 106 21 107 108 109 110 111 114 115 116 117 118 119 62 120 28 121 123 103 124 103 103 125 126 39 127 129 Roles of human Pol κ Pol κ has a crucial TLS role in maintaining genomic stability, particularly in the context of DNA RS caused due to nucleotide deprivation [ 130 131 132 133 134 136 137 138 28 34 139 140 137 141 142 143 144 145 146 148 125 149 152 139 153 154 155 156 DNA Pol ɩ roles Pol ɩ exhibits a distinctive catalytic pocket structure shows a preference for Hoogsteen over Watson–Crick base pairing and has the lowest fidelity among all eukaryotic polymerases [ 157 158 pol η −/− pol ɩ −/− 102 159 161 162 163 144 164 165 166 167 165 168 165 167 169 170 171 171 Pol θ, Pol ζ, and Rev1 roles Pol θ has a distinct structural organization that includes both helicase and TLS polymerase domains within a single polypeptide [ 172 173 174 176 177 178 180 181 182 183 Rev1, in conjunction with Pol ζ, is a key player in error-prone TLS [ 184 186 6 187 191 192 196 197 198 199 202 203 204 205 199 206 207 183 208 209 208 210 211 211 212 213 213 28 142 214 216 208 209 213 Pol ζ is a crucial enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair, playing a key role in maintaining genomic integrity during stressful conditions [ 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 217 TLS polymerase post-translational modifications and implications Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are essential for modulating the activity, stability, localization, and interactions of TLS DNA polymerases and, consequently, tightly controlling the DNA damage tolerance and mutagenesis pathways [ 28 225 229 230 230 231 232 66 233 225 106 229 234 235 236 237 238 TLS roles in cancer therapy resistance TLS plays a significant role in cancer resistance to therapeutic treatments, with several studies indicating that TLS polymerases are overexpressed in various cancers. This overexpression aids in the tolerance of DNA lesions caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, subsequently increasing mutagenesis, which can promote the selection of resistant tumor cells [ 17 239 240 242 215 216 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 253 254 255 257 2 19 29 30 258 262 TLS-based anti-cancer approach and way forward Genotoxic chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (IR) based cancer therapies are known to induce various types of DNA lesions, notably DSBs, single-strand breaks (SSBs), altered nitrogen bases, and ssDNA gaps. These DNA lesions pose an impediment to the growing replication fork and induce RS. While DSBs were considered the most lethal due to their complexity and potential for causing genomic instability, ssDNA gaps were also prevalent. Larger ssDNA gaps can form through the action of various nucleases or during PRIMPOL-mediated repriming [ 171 19 70 89 93 243 263 264 70 93 265 266 127 267 269 258 259 3 19 260 262 19 29 30 70 243 265 270 271 3 183 71 272 274 3 Fig. 3 Graphical illustration depicting TLS-induced chemoresistance in cancer. Anti-cancer therapy involves drugs (such as ATRi, PARPi, Chk1i, ATMi, DNA-PKi, and WEE1i) that directly affect DNA replication and often result in the formation of genome-wide ssDNA gaps, contributing to genotoxicity and killing the cancer cell (Step 1). However, one mechanism by which chemoresistance develops is by activating pathways that suppress these ssDNA gaps, such as TLS (Step 2). TLS can promote replication bypass, post-replication gap filling, and replication fork recovery by replication gap suppression (RGS) during the S/M2 phases of cells (Step 2). Therefore, inhibitors of TLS (TLSi) prove to be effective along with anti-cancer therapy drugs (such as ATRi, PARPi, Chk1i, and WEE1i) (Step 3). Conversely, REV1 TLS inhibition may induce radioresistance through autophagy to + HR cells (Step 4). Recent research indicates that tumor suppressor p53 levels influence the contribution of certain DNA damage tolerance (DDT) factors. Higher p53 levels promote the recovery of the fork by idling and remodeling, while moderate to low levels of p53 promote TLS while p53 level roles in other RGS are unknown (Step 5) Small molecule inhibitors such as JH-RE-06 (inhibit Rev1) of TLS (TLSi) have shown promise in preferentially killing cancer cells, either as monotherapies or in combination with other cancer therapies [ 214 216 3 71 270 271 273 275 276 277 3 214 278 Nonetheless, the current approach to use TLSi along with ATRi, WEE1i, and PARPi proves to be preventing the therapy resistance of cancer cells [ 71 270 271 273 275 279 280 243 281 282 281 283 276 277 284 285 While our understanding of the roles of TLS in cancer therapy resistance is improving, and efforts to develop novel therapeutics based on this knowledge are growing, recent research indicates that our grasp of the RGS role of TLS mechanisms remains limited. It is crucial to further investigate the role of TLS in ssDNA gap suppression. For instance, the interplay between DSB signaling and TLS is of particular interest. The MRN complex ATM kinase, and p53 which are traditionally associated with DSB repair, also play roles in gap suppression. Loss of ATM can result in widespread gaps and heightened sensitivity to PARPi [ 265 286 268 287 288 3 289 290 291 Therefore, the current knowledge indicates that TLS polymerase activities and other DDT mechanisms in RGS are common and have vital implications in cancer biology. Improved knowledge of TLS processes will go a long way toward explaining how cancer cells react to therapeutic drugs. Inhibiting pathways that allow gap suppression or block apoptosis could result in more durable responses to chemotherapy. In addition, the interactions between DSBs repair signaling and TLS mediation are areas of investigation that require more research. Elevated baseline levels of gaps can be used to predict vulnerability to specific treatments, which would imply that future treatment regimens may emphasize drugs that cause gaps over those causing DSBs. Conclusion The reviewed manuscript underscores the critical and multifaceted role of human TLS polymerases in navigating RS, a process that is pivotal in maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer. Despite their protective functions, these polymerases can also contribute to mutagenesis, highlighting their dual nature as both contributing to genome preservation and acting as potential catalysts for genomic instability. The detailed understanding of TLS mechanisms and the roles of TLS polymerases in DNA damage tolerance, somatic hypermutation, and cancer therapy resistance provides valuable insights for developing targeted cancer treatments. Future research should focus on further elucidating the interplay between TLS, DNA damage signaling, and cellular responses to stress, particularly in the context of cancer therapy resistance and genome stability. This knowledge will be crucial for designing more effective therapeutic strategies that exploit the vulnerabilities of cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal cells.
