This association is linked to chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Patients with RA have a 1.5-2 times higher risk of CVD compared to the general population, and cardiovascular mortality reaches 40%-50%. However, basic anti-inflammatory drugs such as methotrexate reduce the rate of cardiovascular events by 20%-30% due to suppression of systemic inflammation. Biological medications also demonstrate a cardioprotective effect, reducing the risk of MI by 20%-40%, although some ( e.g. Rheumatoid arthritis Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs Cardiovascular events Inflammation Atherosclerosis pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes  Core Tip: INTRODUCTION Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by progressive joint destruction due to erosive arthritis and a generalized autoimmune process, in which immune complexes and cytokines damage blood vessels and internal organs. A distinctive feature of RA is systemic inflammation, which contributes to a more severe course of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). The prognosis in RA is determined less by chronic erosive arthritis and more by comorbid conditions, especially atherosclerosis-related pathology. A meta-analysis of prospective studies showed that the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with RA is 48% higher than in the general population[ 1 2 4 Even before the development of RA or in its early stages, markers of cardiovascular system involvement can be detected in 35%-50% of cases. These markers include endothelial dysfunction, reduced elasticity of both small and large blood vessels, and diastolic myocardial dysfunction, the intensity of which increases with disease duration[ 5 7 The accelerated development of atherosclerosis in patients with RA may be partly due to similar pathogenic mechanisms shared by both diseases (Table 1 8 10 Table 1 Pathogenetic similarities between rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis  Pathogenic mechanism  Rheumatoid arthritis  Atherosclerosis  Common features Chronic inflammation Synovial membrane activation, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 release Vascular wall inflammation, same cytokines Systemic inflammation, TNF-α/IL-6 role Autoimmune component Autoantibodies (RF, ACPA) Autoantibodies to oxidized LDL Immune complexes, Th1 response Macrophage activation Synovial infiltration → pannus formation Oxidized LDL uptake → foam cells Macrophages as key effectors Oxidative stress ROS-mediated cartilage & synovium damage LDL oxidation → plaque formation ROS-driven tissue destruction Endothelial dysfunction Microangiopathy, synovial neovascularization Impaired vascular barrier function VCAM-1/ICAM-1 upregulation Neoangiogenesis Angiogenesis in synovium → arthritis progression Plaque instability due to new vessels Pathological vessel growth Fibrosis/tissue remodeling Joint deformity (excess collagen) Fibrous cap formation on plaques Fibroblast activation Biomarkers CRP, ACPA, RF CRP, oxidized LDL, IL-6 Shared markers (CRP, IL-6) TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1β: Interleukin-1β; IL-6: Interleukin-6; VCAM-1: Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; ICAM-1: Intercellular adhesion molecule-1; LDL: Low-density lipoprotein; CRP: C-reactive protein; ACPA: Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies; RF: Rheumatoid factor; Th1: T-helper 1 cells; ROS: Reactive oxygen species. An association has been established between elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the increased risk of MI and stroke in patients with RA[ 11 12 13 Cytokines link the pathogenesis of RA and CVD through shared mechanisms such as chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress (Table 2 14 16 Table 2 Role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease  Cytokine  Major sources  Effects in RA  Effects in CVD  Common pathogenic effects TNF-α Macrophages, Th1 cells, adipocytes Activates synovial fibroblasts Endothelial dysfunction NF-κB activation Stimulates osteoclasts ( via Increased leukocyte adhesion Induction of cellular apoptosis Induces MMP-9 production Atherosclerotic plaque destabilization Stimulation of IL-6 production IL-6 Macrophages, Th1 cells, adipocytes Stimulates B-cells (RF production) Enhances fibrinogen synthesis JAK/STAT pathway activation Induces acute-phase proteins (CRP, SAA) Promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy Induction of insulin resistance Causes anemia of chronic disease Accelerates atherogenesis IL-1β Macrophages, neutrophils Stimulates chondrocyte protease production Increases platelet aggregation NLRP3 inflammasome activation Induces fever and pain Upregulates adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) Angiogenesis stimulation Activates osteoclasts Plaque destabilization IL-17 Th17 cells, γδT cells Promotes synovial neoangiogenesis Increases endothelial ET-1 production MAPK pathway activation Induces neutrophil infiltration Promotes myocardial fibrosis Stimulates IL-6 production Synergizes with TNF-α Enhances oxidative stress IL-10 Tregs, B-cells, macrophages Suppresses TNF-α and IL-6 production Stabilizes atherosclerotic plaques NF-κB inhibition Inhibits Th17 activation Reduces leukocyte adhesion SOCS3 stimulation IFN-γ Th1, natural killer cells Activates synovial macrophages Increases plaque vulnerability STAT1 activation Inhibits Th17 differentiation Stimulates smooth muscle cell apoptosis Enhances MHC II expression TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-6: Interleukin-6; IL-1β: Interleukin-1β; IL-17: Interleukin-17; IL-10: Interleukin-10; IFN-γ: Interferon-gamma; T-helper 1/17: Lymphocyte subsets (Th1; Th17); γδT: Gamma-delta T cells; Tregs: Regulatory T cells; RANKL: Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; VCAM-1: Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; ET-1: Endothelin-1; MHC II: Major histocompatibility complex class II; CRP: C-reactive protein; SAA: Serum amyloid A; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis. The increased risk of CVD typically manifests in the presence of genetic predisposition and largely depends on traditional risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. It is further exacerbated by dyslipidemia, smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, family history of CVD, and menopause (Figure 1 16 18 3 19 20 Figure 1  Shared pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Table 3 Comparison of CANTOS and CIRT trials: Impact of anti-inflammatory therapy on cardiovascular outcomes  Criterion  CANTOS (2017)  CIRT (2019) Study drug Canakinumab (IL-1β inhibitor) Methotrexate Study objective Evaluate IL-1β suppression on cardiovascular outcomes Test if low-dose immunosuppression reduces CVD risk Design Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Patient population 10061 patients with CAD and hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L 4786 patients with CAD/metabolic syndrome + diabetes/obesity Primary outcomes 15% reduction in acute coronary syndrome (MI, unstable angina, cardiac death) ( P No significant effect: No difference in CVD outcomes vs P 37%-41% reduction in hs-CRP Effect on inflammation Sustained reduction in IL-6 and hs-CRP Minimal impact on CRP Adverse effects ↑ Fatal infections (0.18 vs ↑ Liver enzyme abnormalities ↑ LDL levels ↑ Leukopenia risk Conclusions Hypothesis confirmed: IL-1β is a valid target for secondary CVD prevention Hypothesis rejected: Methotrexate does not reduce CVD risk in this population IL-1β: Interleukin-1β; hs-CRP: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein; CAD: Coronary artery disease; MI: Myocardial infarction; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; LDL: Low-density lipoprotein. RA is characterized by the so-called lipid paradox: Low levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the presence of active inflammation. These levels tend to rise following the initiation of RA treatment, but this does not correlate with increased CVD risk. This paradox is likely due to the effects of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which increase LDL and SRB1 receptor activity on hepatocytes, leading to increased hepatic LDL uptake and cholesterol secretion into bile, thus reducing circulating LDL levels. RA is also associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HF), predominantly with preserved ejection fraction[ 21 22 2+ 23 Many disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are approved for RA treatment in clinical guidelines from different countries[ 24 26 First-line treatment for RA involves csDMARDs, with MTX being the preferred choice (if no contraindications exist). In cases of MTX intolerance, it may be substituted with LEF, SSZ, or HCQ, either as monotherapy or in combination. If csDMARDs prove insufficiently effective, bDMARDs or tsDMARDs may be added or substituted. TNF inhibitors are the first-line bDMARDs, especially in seropositive RA with high disease activity. Other bDMARDs are typically reserved for patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF inhibitors, with agent selection based on safety profiles and individual risk factors. JAK inhibitors are usually employed following failure of bDMARD therapy. The mechanisms of action of DMARDs in the context of RA and CVD development are summarized in Table 4 Table 4 Comprehensive classification of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs by mechanism of action  Drug class/target  Mechanism of action  CVD benefit/risks  Specific drugs (examples)  Key characteristics Conventional synthetic DMARDs Folate antagonists Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase → ↓ purine synthesis → lymphocyte apoptosis ↓Cardiovascular mortality Methotrexate Gold standard for RA ↑ Extracellular adenosine Weekly dosing (SC/PO) ↓ TNF-α/IL-6 Requires folate supplementation Pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors Blocks dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) → ↓ lymphocyte proliferation Neutral/↑ hypertension Leflunomide Teratogenic (requires washout) Active metabolite (teriflunomide) NF-κB inhibitors Scavenges ROS, inhibits NF-κB → ↓ TNF-α/IL-6 ↓ Oxidative stress in endothelium Sulfasalazine Split into 5-ASA (gut) + sulfapyridine (systemic) Safe in pregnancy Lysosomotropic agents ↑ Lysosomal pH → ↓ TLR7/9 signaling and antigen presentation Anti-thrombotic (↓ platelet aggregation) Hydroxychloroquine Slow onset (3-6 months) Retinopathy risk at high cumulative doses Biologic DMARDs TNF-α Neutralizes soluble/membrane-bound TNF ↓ IL-1/6/8, ↓ metalloproteinases ↑ Endothelial function Adalimumab, Infliximab First-line biologics Screen for TB/HBV IL-6 pathway Blocks IL-6 receptor or ligand: ↓ JAK/STAT3, ↓ Th17 differentiation ↓ LDL oxidation Tocilizumab, Olokizumab Rapid CRP reduction May ↑ LDL T-cell Co-stimulation CTLA4-Ig binds CD80/86 → ↓ T-cell activation ↓ Atherosclerosis progression Abatacept Lower infection risk vs B-cell Depletion Anti-CD20 → B-cell lysis ↓ Autoantibodies, ↓ Antigen presentation ↓ Atheroma progression Rituximab Preferred for seropositive RA Prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia risk IL-1 Recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist Reducing atherosclerotic progression and stabilizing plaques Anakinra Limited use in RA (more for autoinflammatory diseases) Targeted synthetic DMARDs JAK inhibitors Blocks JAK-STAT signaling: ↓ IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-15 signaling; ↓ GM-CSF, IL-12/23 pathways ↑ LDL Potential ↑ thrombosis Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib Oral administration Boxed warning for thrombosis Avoid in elderly smokers DMARDs: Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; RA: Rheumatoid arthritis; 5-ASA: 5-aminosalicylic acid; DHODH: Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; TLR7/9: Toll-like receptor 7/9; TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1/6/8: Interleukin-1/6/8; TB: Tuberculosis; HBV: Hepatitis B virus; Th17: T-helper 17 cells; CTLA4-Ig: Cytotoxic t-lymphocyte: Associated protein 4 immunoglobulin; IFN-γ: Interferon-Gamma; GM-CSF: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; LDL: Low-density lipoprotein; CRP: C-reactive protein; ACS: Acute coronary syndrome; SC: Subcutaneous; PO: Per os (oral). Given the key role of chronic inflammation and autoimmune dysfunction in the development of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular complications in RA, effective anti-inflammatory therapy plays a vital role in prevention. Adequate inflammation control, tailored to the pathogenic overlap between these diseases, theoretically reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. In this regard, studying the cardiovascular effects of DMARDs is of undeniable importance. DMARDS IMPACT ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISKS Conventional synthetic DMARDs: MTX MTX is currently the most commonly used drug in the treatment of RA. Its high efficiency has earned it the status of the “gold standard” in the treatment of this condition. Over the past decades, MTX has become the first-line drug for RA and the most frequently used component of combination therapy. As mentioned, the CIRT trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, demonstrated that low doses of MTX did not reduce the frequency of cardiovascular events, nor the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as CRP, IL-1β, and IL-6, compared to the placebo group. However, the study included patients with established ischemic heart disease and diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or both, but not patients with RA[ 20 Other studies have shown different results when assessing the impact of MTX on cardiovascular events in patients with rheumatic diseases. A multicenter, prospective cohort study by Johnson et al 27 28 In the study by Wasko et al 29 In addition to its impact on prognosis, studies have also examined the effect of MTX on classical CVD risk factors. According to Wållberg-Jonsson et al 30 To date, numerous studies have investigated the effects of MTX on blood lipid profiles in RA patients, but the findings remain contradictory. Some report a reduction in the atherogenic index and blood anti-atherogenic lipoproteins in MTX-treated RA patients, correlating with decreased acute-phase reactant levels[ 31 32 33 34 The exact mechanisms by which long-term MTX therapy reduces CVD risk remain unclear. However, it is evident that this effect occurs alongside improved control of RA activity and systemic inflammation. As a result, the intensity of vascular dysfunction, underlying the development and progression of atherothrombosis, is reduced. Moreover, not only long-term but even single-dose MTX administration can lead to a decrease in acute-phase proteins, inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, reduction of toxic oxygen metabolite production, and prevention of leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium[ 35 Indirect mechanisms by which MTX influences the development of atherosclerosis and its complications in RA have also been discussed. According to Cronstein and Reiss[ 36 37 38 Despite its anti-inflammatory effects, MTX may have adverse cardiovascular effects by inducing hyperhomocysteinemia, endothelial dysfunction, accelerated atherosclerosis, increased thrombosis risk, and direct cardiotoxicity (Table 5 Table 5 The negative effects of methotrexate on the cardiovascular system  Effect  Pathogenesis Cardiomyopathy Folate depletion → impaired myocardial energy metabolism Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction Accumulation of adenosine → vasodilation and reduced contractility Accelerated atherosclerosis Hyperhomocysteinemia (due to folate antagonism) → endothelial dysfunction Vascular toxicity Endothelial injury due to oxidative stress Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability Increased homocysteine → vascular smooth muscle proliferation Hypertension Renal toxicity → sodium retention Endothelial dysfunction → impaired vasoregulation Heart failure Direct myocardial toxicity (similar to cardiomyopathy) Fluid retention due to renal impairment Arrhythmias Electrolyte imbalances ( e.g. MTX: Methotrexate. Conventional synthetic DMARDs: LEF LEF is traditionally considered a second-line drug for monotherapy in RA ( e.g. e.g. Despite its potential anti-inflammatory benefits, LEF may have adverse effects, with arterial hypertension being the most frequently reported (occurring in approximately 5% of patients). This is hypothesized to result from fluid retention and endothelial dysfunction due to impaired nitric oxide synthesis[ 39 Conventional synthetic DMARDs: SSZ SSZ is a drug for combination therapy in RA. Consequently, there are no large-scale studies evaluating the effect of this drug as monotherapy on cardiovascular risk in patients with RA. SSZ suppresses the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. In both animal models and humans with CVD risk factors, NF-κB activation in the endothelium leads to impaired vasodilatory function[ 40 41 42 43 et al 44 vs via Moreover, SSZ has been shown to positively influence the lipid profile by increasing HDL levels and reducing the atherogenic index[ 45 46 Conventional synthetic DMARDs: HCQ HCQ is most widely used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, and in RA, it is traditionally considered primarily as a component of dual or triple combination therapy. The drug demonstrates potential anti-atherosclerotic properties, which are particularly relevant for patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. These effects are mediated through several key mechanisms. Multiple studies have demonstrated a direct effect of HCQ on lipid metabolism, including reductions in total cholesterol and LDL levels, achieved by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver via 47 48 49 50 51 52 There is further evidence that HCQ inhibits nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, an enzyme responsible for generating active oxygen species that accelerate atherosclerosis[ 53 54 55 A retrospective observational study by Cordova Sanchez et al 56 Of particular concern is the potential of HCQ to prolong the QT interval due to blockade of hERG potassium channels, leading to impaired ventricular repolarization. This increases the risk of torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death, especially in the setting of hypokalemia, concomitant use of other QT-prolonging drugs ( e.g. 57 58 Another serious complication is toxic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with the cumulative dose and duration of therapy, especially in patients treated with HCQ for more than 10 years[ 59 TNF inhibitors TNF-α is one of the key mediators of atherogenesis. It induces endothelial dysfunction, upregulates cell adhesion molecules that facilitate leukocyte migration into the vascular wall, contributes to the destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, suppresses anticoagulant properties while promoting procoagulant activity of the endothelium, impairs myocardial contractility, and stimulates CRP synthesis[ 60 61 62 64 65 + - 66 Barnabe et al 65 et al 67 et al 68 69 Data on the impact of anti-TNF-α therapy on BP are contradictory. Some studies show a moderate BP reduction due to improved endothelial function and reduced systemic inflammation[ 70 et al 71 TNF-α also has a negative inotropic effect on the myocardium and contributes to left ventricular remodeling and the progression of HF[ 72 vs 73 74 Overall, anti-TNF-α therapy exerts a complex influence on the cardiovascular system, primarily through suppression of systemic inflammation and improvement of endothelial function. However, its use in patients with HF requires caution, and further research is needed to clarify its long-term safety profile. IL-6 inhibitors Among IL-6 inhibitors used in rheumatology, the following monoclonal antibodies are of particular interest: Tocilizumab, sarilumab, olokizumab, and levilimab. Most studies have focused on the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab. The literature presents contradictory data regarding its effects on lipid profiles. For example, the randomized placebo-controlled MEASURE trial demonstrated that LDL levels increased by approximately 15%-20% in patients receiving tocilizumab. However, lipoprotein(a) levels decreased by more than 30%, and HDL levels, as well as HDL composition, shifted toward patterns associated with anti-inflammatory effects[ 75 The ADACTA trial compared the influence of tocilizumab and adalimumab on lipid profiles in RA patients[ 76 77 A study by Toussirot et al 78 Several studies have found no clinically significant differences in treatment-related side effects among sarilumab, olokizumab, and levilimab[ 79 80 81 Olokizumab is unique among anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies in its mechanism of action. The randomized controlled trials CREDO 1 and CREDO 2 evaluated the efficacy and safety of olokizumab in RA. These studies demonstrated reductions in inflammatory markers, including CRP and fibrinogen, which may theoretically reduce cardiovascular risk[ 82 83 Despite the absence of a clear increase in cardiovascular risk, some studies have reported a paradoxical rise in LDL without worsening prognosis. This may be related to changes in the functional properties of lipoproteins. Therefore, caution is advised in patients with high cardiovascular risk ( e.g. Interleukin-1 inhibitors Anakinra is a drug that provides dual inhibition of IL-1α and IL-1β. Several studies have examined its impact on cardiovascular risk, not only in RA patients but also in those with acute MI. For example, a study by Abbate et al 84 A meta-analysis by Zheng et al 85 The multicenter randomized TRACK trial demonstrated that anakinra therapy significantly improved glycemic control and reduced RA activity, which may counteract the synergy between traditional CVD risk factors and inflammation that accelerates atherosclerosis[ 86 87 88 89 Anti-CD20-antibodies Among this class of drugs, rituximab is used in rheumatology and was approved in 2006 for the treatment of patients with RA who had an inadequate response to at least one TNF-α inhibitor. In a study by Provan et al 90 e.g In contrast, an earlier study by Mathieu et al 91 et al 92 et al 69 et al 92 93 Rituximab rarely causes direct cardiotoxic effects, but infusion reactions may lead to hemodynamic disturbances. Reported complications following drug administration include the following: (1) Arrhythmias (rare)-including cases of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia; (2) Hypotension due to cytokine release syndrome; and (3) Cute coronary syndrome (very rare), triggered by histamine and other mediator release. Thus, in patients with autoimmune diseases, rituximab may reduce systemic inflammation, potentially lowering cardiovascular risk. However, in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions, close monitoring during infusion is essential. T-Helper cell co-stimulation blockers Within this class, abatacept is the only drug currently used in rheumatology. The literature presents conflicting data regarding its influence on cardiovascular risk across different patient age groups. A study by Kang et al 94 94 95 The risk of venous thromboembolism is significantly higher in patients receiving abatacept compared to those treated with TNF-α inhibitors, both in patients with and without diabetes[ 94 et al 95 et al 94 A study by Mathieu et al 96 e.g. Unlike TNF-α inhibitors, which may exacerbate HF, abatacept has not been associated with an increased risk of decompensation. Therefore, abatacept may be a preferable option for patients with high cardiovascular risk or those experiencing adverse lipid profile changes with other therapies. JAK inhibitors Among tsDMARDs, the following are currently included in various international clinical guidelines for the treatment of RA: Tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and filgotinib. All of them belong to the class of JAK inhibitors. This group of drugs demonstrates efficiency comparable to that of other DMARDs in the treatment of RA[ 97 One practical advantage of JAK inhibitors is their oral formulation, which improves adherence. This allows for long-term outpatient treatment (no need for hospital visits or parenteral administration), eliminates the requirement for refrigerated storage, and offers a more convenient option for patients who dislike injections. A specific drawback of tofacitinib is its twice-daily dosing, though an extended-release formulation requiring once-daily administration is now available. However, the cardiovascular safety profile of this drug class remains inconclusive, prompting close scrutiny by regulatory authorities (FDA, EMA). In 2022, to minimize the risk of serious adverse events associated with JAK inhibitors, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency recommended restrictions on their use for certain indications. These included chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis, and alopecia areata. PRAC identified high-risk groups in which JAK inhibitors should be used only if no suitable alternatives exist. These groups include patients aged ≥65 years, those with increased CVD risk ( e.g. The basis for this decision was the open-label clinical trial A3921133, which compared the safety of tofacitinib with TNF-α inhibitors in 4362 RA patients aged ≥ 50 years with at least one cardiovascular risk factor[ 98 99 100 101 102 103 In the RA-BUILD trial, which studied dose-dependent effects of baricitinib, an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism was observed in patients receiving 4 mg/day. However, comprehensive safety analyses showed that overall risk was not higher than in the general population, regardless of whether baricitinib was taken at 2 mg or 4 mg/day. Risk was more closely associated with age, comorbid conditions (obesity, chronic lung disease, varicose veins), a history of venous thromboembolism, and concomitant use of selective cyclooxygenases-2 inhibitors[ 104 105 An analysis of data from a phase III clinical trial of upadacitinib in the SELECT-RA program, in which 54% of patients were considered high risk due to age and smoking status, showed that despite an increased risk of cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, and malignant tumors, the incidence rates were comparable across all therapy groups[ 106 The cardiovascular safety of filgotinib is currently regarded as satisfactory. The incidence of cardiovascular events and venous thromboembolism in patients treated with this JAK inhibitor did not differ significantly from those observed with adalimumab, MTX, or placebo[ 107 The safety profile of various JAK inhibitors in RA was analyzed by Alves et al 108 The mechanisms potentially linking JAK inhibitor therapy to increased cardiovascular risk remain unclear and require further investigation. Therefore, the current approach to prescribing these drugs involves a careful risk–benefit assessment for each patient. CONCLUSION RA is associated with an increased risk of CVD, driven by chronic inflammation, traditional risk factors, and the potential cardiotoxicity of some antirheumatic drugs. Modern treatment strategies should not only focus on controlling inflammation but also on minimizing cardiovascular risk. The use of DMARDs has demonstrated beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system through the reduction of systemic inflammation. However, some drugs, such as JAK inhibitors, require close monitoring due to a possible increase in the risk of thrombosis and other cardiovascular events. To improve prognosis in RA patients, it is essential to conduct regular screening for cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking), tailor therapy to each patient’s cardiovascular profile, and adopt a multidisciplinary approach involving both rheumatologists and cardiologists. A summary of cardiovascular safety profiles for DMARDs, preventive measures, and preferred patient categories is provided in Table 6 Table 6 Comparative safety of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: Cardiovascular risks and patient considerations  Drug class  Drug  Prevention of adverse cardiovascular effects methods  Preferred patient category  Safety comparison csDMARDs Methotrexate Homocysteine control (target level < 10 μmol/L); Folic acid supplementation (5-10 mg/day)-reduces the risk of hyperhomocysteinemia by 50%-70%.
