This study aimed to assess the skeletal muscle of these patients and compare them with healthy controls. Methods Biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of 28 nonhospitalised PCC patients without concomitant diseases (75% women, mean age 46.4 ± 10.4 years) and 28 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls (79% women, mean age 46.6 ± 8.7 years). The analysis included morphological and pathological alterations, fibre type composition, fibre cross‐sectional area, capillarisation, number of myonuclei, presence of developmental myosin, CD68 + Results PCC patients, compared to controls, had a higher percentage of angulated fibres (median [IQR] 0.43 [0.00–3.20] vs. 0.00 [0.00–0.00]; p p p 2 p 2 p 2 p p + p p p p p Conclusions Nonhospitalised patients with PCC show signs of morphological and pathological muscle changes suggestive of degeneration and regeneration. The smaller overall fibre size, lower number of phospholipids, reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity and lower capillarisation in these patients may be a consequence of reduced physical activity levels. The presence of clusters of atrophied angular and round‐shaped fibres, signs of inflammation and fibrosis and increased expression of fetal myosin may reflect myopathic and neurogenic post‐viral effects.

RNA sequencing offers powerful high‐throughput insights into the global gene expression and regulatory pathways, enabling the identification of differential expression of all genes in skeletal muscle [ 11 12 13 To address this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of muscle biopsies from our cohort, consisting of well‐defined nonhospitalised PCC patients and an equal number of age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls, to further characterize the suspected muscle abnormalities. We performed morphological and pathological examinations, along with quantitative and qualitative immunochemical assessments of fibre type composition, cross‐sectional area, capillarisation, inflammation and macroautophagy markers. Additionally, we assessed mitochondrial respiration and performed targeted lipidomics and exploratory RNA sequencing to provide a comprehensive assessment of skeletal muscle properties. We hypothesised that PCC would be associated with a glycolytic shift and features of myopathy, including decreased mitochondrial function, supported by altered gene expression and pathway signatures. 2 Methods 2.1 Study Design In the current study, we analyzed muscle biopsies from patients with PCC and an equal number of age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls as part of a randomized controlled trial [ 6 NCT05445830 6 2.2 Muscle Biopsies After an overnight fast and no physical activity for 48 h, tissue samples were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle under local anaesthesia using the percutaneous Bergström technique [ 14 2.3 Enzyme Histochemistry and Basic Histology Frozen muscle samples were prepared for histological analysis. Briefly, muscle samples were cut into 7‐μm thick sections using a cryostat chamber (CryoStar NX70 HOMVPD, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and collected on glass slides (Superfrost Plus, Epredia) and stored at −80°C. The samples were stained with routine haematoxylin–eosin (H&E) [ 12 2.4 Immunochemical Analysis The muscle sections were processed for immunocytochemistry using previously characterized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Table S1 In brief, before immunostaining with Abs BA‐F8, 11 575, 4C7, CD68, LC3B and p62, the muscle tissue sections were rehydrated in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After rinsing (in PBS containing 0.05% Tween) and permeabilization (in 0.5% Triton X‐100 in PBS), the sections were immersed in 5% normal goat serum (NGS or Carbo‐Free Blocking Buffer) for 30 min. The sections immunostained for Z0097, A0245 and 15200 were immersed in 5% normal nonimmune donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd., Cambridgeshire, Ely, UK) for 15 min and rinsed in 0.01 M PBS for 3 × 5 min. The samples were then incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies diluted to appropriate concentrations in NGS or bovine serum albumin (BSA). After overnight incubation, sections were rinsed in PBS, followed by a second block with 5% NGS or BSA for 30 min. After additional washes in PBS, bound primary Abs were visualised by indirect immunofluorescence using affinity‐purified secondary Abs prepared for multiple labelling (RRX) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd., Cambridgeshire, Ely, UK) and mounted in Prolong Gold Antifade reagent DAPI (Invitrogen by Thermofisher Scientific, Eugene, Oregon, USA) or fluorescence mounting medium (Agilent, S3023) (Table S1 2.5 Morphological Analysis For analysis of muscle fibre type, fibre size, myonuclear content and capillarisation, muscle cross‐sections were scanned and examined at 10× magnification using a Vectra 3.0 automated quantitative pathology imaging system (Akoya Biosciences. Inc) with the filter DAPI/FITC/Cy3/Cy5. Images were processed using CellProfiler software (Cellprofiler 4.2.6) and the pipeline “Muscle2View” to analyze muscle fibre characteristics, including fibre type composition, cross‐sectional area (CSA), myonuclear content and capillary metrics as previously described [ 13 c ImageJ 2.6 Mitochondrial Respiration Mitochondria were isolated from fresh muscle tissue using previously described protocols [ 15 16 −1 2 2.7 Targeted Lipidomics Lipids were extracted overnight from ~20 mg of weighed muscle tissue using Folch solution (1:2 methanol:chloroform) with internal standards (0.5 μg/mL). The organic phase was transferred to new glass tubes and dried under nitrogen. Lipids were reconstituted in one part hexane and two parts isopropanol to a final volume of 100 μL and transferred to vials for LC–MS/MS. Analysis was performed using a Waters Acquity UHPLC coupled to a Xevo TQ‐X mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with an ACQUITY C18 column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) at 60°C  . Mobile 2.8 RNA Extraction and RNA Sequencing RNA was extracted from ~20‐mg frozen muscle samples. Briefly, a bead‐beater device (BioSpec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) was used to homogenate the tissue in TriZol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by chloroform gradient separation and ethanol dilution. After this, the Direct‐zol RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA) was used to purify the RNA following the manufacturer's specifications. The quality of RNA was assessed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer System, with RNA integrity number (RIN) ≥ 8.5 reported across all samples. We also quantified total RNA content in relation to muscle weight (ng/mg). Poly‐A enriched libraries were pair‐end sequenced using NovaSeq6000 platform (Illumina) across six flow cells and seven lanes. The obtained raw sequencing reads were submitted to FastQC (v0.12.1) for quality control, and only samples with a mean sequence quality score (Phred) > 30 was further aligned to the reference (GRCh38) using Kallisto sequence pseudo‐aligner (v0.50.1). Of the average processed reads (~27 million/library), 70%–88% were aligned across all samples. 2.9 Statistics Analysis was performed using IBM SPSS, version 29.0 (IBM Corp), GraphPad Prism 9 for lipidomics and R version 4.3.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) for gene‐expression analyses. Details of the power calculation, which was based on primary outcomes, have been published previously [ 6 t U 2 p 17 18 17 3 Results Out of 62 subjects enrolled in this study (PCC, n 6 n n n 1 TABLE 1 Characteristics for the post‐COVID condition patients ( n n PCC patients Controls  p Age, mean (SD), years 46.4 (10.4) 46.6 (8.7) 0.934 Sex, n 21 (75%) 22 (79%) 0.752 BMI, mean (SD), m 2 25.2 (3.1) 25.4 (3.6) 0.818 Diabetes, n 0 (0) 2 (7) 0.150 Hypertension, n 4 (14) 4 (14) 1.000 Smoker, n 1 (4) 2 (7) 0.553 Beta blocker, n a 7 (25) 2 (7) 0.069 COVID‐19 infection, n b 28 (100) 16 (57) COVID‐19 vaccinated, n 25 (89) 26 (93) 0.639 Duration PCC symptoms 21.2 (9.5) NA mMRC dyspnoea, mean (SD), score 1.9 (1.0) 0.6 (0.6)  p PCFS, mean (SD), score 2.6 (0.8) NA Godin‐Sheperd Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire Before COVID‐19, mean (SD), units 50.1 (19.1) NA Current, mean (SD), units 23.7 (15.6) 50.6 (27.8)   p SF‐36 Questionnaire Physical function, mean (SD), score 50.4 (19.2) 92.0 (4.7) <0.001 Physical role, mean (SD), score 11.6 (22.0) 95.5 (19.3) <0.001 Emotional role, mean (SD), score 73.8 (41.9) 98.8 (6.3) 0.004 Mental health, mean (SD), score 23.8 (20.6) 75.4 (13.7) <0.001 Social function, mean (SD), score 68.0 (19.5) 85.3 (10.2) <0.001 Bodily pain, mean (SD), score 42.0 (26.2) 95.1 (13.3) <0.001 Vitality, mean (SD), score 44.7 (26.0) 90.4 (15.9) <0.001 General health, mean (SD), score 39.8 (18.1) 83.8 (10.3) <0.001 Physical function 6‐Min walk, mean (SD), m 457 (83) 490 (67) 0.102 Isometric 120 deg., mean (SD), N*m 149.2 (54.8) 186.5 (67.2) 0.027 Handgrip MVC, mean (SD), kg 36.4 (10.9) 40.9 (17.3) 0.250 Accelerometers MVPA, mean (SD), min/day 34.9 (28.8) 60.3 (31.2) 0.004 Total PA, mean (SD), min/day 317.1 (267.9) 299.6 (76.4) 0.755 Sedentary time, mean (SD), min/day 578.6 (78.1) 565.1 (72.4) 0.525 Blood biomarkers Leukocytes, mean (SD), x10(9)/L 5.6 (1.3) 5.7 (1.6) 0.836 Erythrocytes, mean (SD), x10(12)/L 4.4 (0.4) 4.4 (0.5) 0.845 Thrombocytes, mean (SD), x10(9)/L 251.7 (54.5) 259.5 (78.5) 0.681 Haemoglobin, mean (SD), g/L 132.8 (10.8) 132.2 (10.5) 0.839 CRP, mean (SD), mg/L 0.9 (1.0) 1.2 (1.4) 0.411 CPET VO 2 peak, 29.2 (7.8) 35.5 (7.4) 0.003 Electromyography Normal, n 10 (37) 24 (92) Myopathic indices, n 12 (44) 0 (0) Myopathic indices borderline, n 4 (15) 1 (4) Neuropathic indices, n 1 (4) 1 (4) <0.001  Note: t 2 p Abbreviations: BMI: body mass index; mMRC: modified medical research council scale for dyspnoea 0–4; PCFS: post‐COVID functional status 0–4; MVC: maximal voluntary contraction; PA: physical activity; MVPA: moderate and vigorous PA; VO 2  a Current use.  b Verified COVID‐19 infection. 3.1 General Muscle Morphology and Pathology The muscle samples from PCC patients differed from the controls by having a significantly higher proportion of small‐sized fibres with an angular ( p 1A p 1B 2 2 S2 2 3 S2 3 S2 3 3 p 1 2 S2 FIGURE 1 A) Presence of small angular atrophic fibres, B) presence of small, rounded fibres and C) fibres expressing fetal MyHC in the skeletal muscle of patients with PCC ( n n p FIGURE 2 Muscle cross‐sections from a control subject (A) and PCC patients (B–F) histologically stained for H&E (A–C), immunohistochemically stained for fibronectin (D), double‐stained for laminin (red) and fetal MyHC (green) (E) and triple stained for desmin (green), laminin (red) and DAPI (blue) (F). Note the presence of atrophic angular fibres (arrows), sometimes clustered (asterisk) and nail‐shaped, and very small fibres with a more rounded appearance (arrowheads, B–D, F) in PCC patients. D illustrates a region with fibrosis and clusters (asterisks) of atrophic angulated (arrows) and round‐shaped fibres (arrowhead). A muscle fibre expressing fetal MyHC is shown in (E) (arrow), and a mixture of atrophic (arrowhead) and hypertrophic fibres (white circle) is illustrated in F. Bars = 100 μm. FIGURE 3 Muscle cross‐sections from a control subject (A) and PCC patients (BF) histochemically stained for mitochondrial NADH‐TR (A–C), H&E (D) and immunohistochemically for fibronectin (E), as well as triple stained for desmin (green), laminin (red) and DAPI (blue) (F). Note the generally lower mitochondrial staining for NADH‐TR, particularly in type 2 fibres of PCC patients (B, C) compared to controls (A). Observe also the fibre with an abnormal distribution and subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria (arrow, B) and the characteristic high NADH‐TR staining activity in denervated atrophic angular fibres (arrows, C), regardless of whether they are type 1 or type 2 fibres. D–F shows an area with extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibrosis (asterisks), fat infiltration (arrowheads) and ingrowth of vessels (red in F). Phagocytes invading necrotic muscle fibres can be seen in the areas marked with asterisks (D). The inset in D reveals a small area infiltrated by inflammatory cells in another PCC patient.

In particular, three genes mainly related to mitochondrial function (NIPSNAP1, logFC = 0.55, FDR = 0.024), metabolite transport (SLC16A12, logFC = 0.51, FDR = 0.009) and endothelial function (PLVAP, logFC = 0.75, FDR = 0.024) were lower expressed in PCC patients compared to controls, whereas two genes related to basic cellular processes including DNA packaging (NAP1L4, logFC = −3.43, FDR = 3.19 × 10 −9 Gene‐set enrichment analysis identified 8 differentially regulated pathways between patients and controls (FDR < 0.05), all of which had a lower expression in PCC patients than in controls. All the differentially expressed pathways were involved in metabolism, and in particular, oxidative phosphorylation (Table 3 TABLE 3 Gene‐set enrichment analysis in skeletal muscle of patients with PCC ( n n Pathway Set size Enrichment score  p  p Electron transport chain (OXPHOS system in mitochondria) 71 0.84 1 × 10 −10 7 × 10 −9 Oxidative phosphorylation 37 0.84 1 × 10 −10 7 × 10 −9 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 80 0.67 1 × 10 −10 7 × 10 −9 Mitochondrial complex I assembly model OXPHOS system 33 0.81 5 × 10 −10 3 × 10 −8 Amino acid metabolism 44 0.70 3 × 10 −7 1 × 10 −5 Metabolic reprogramming in colon cancer 23 0.71 2 × 10 −4 9 × 10 −3 mRNA targets in ECM and membrane receptors 16 0.76 3 × 10 −4 1 × 10 −2 Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis 22 0.69 9 × 10 −4 2 × 10 −2 Cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins 58 0.51 1 × 10 −3 3 × 10 −2  Note: p 4 Discussion This study shows that nonhospitalised and previously healthy PCC patients have pathological skeletal muscle characteristics including clusters of small angular fibres and a notably higher presence of small round fibres. Moreover, signs of inflammation, fibrosis and fatty infiltration were observed in some PCC cases, and patients had a higher frequency of fibres expressing fetal myosin, a lower number of myonuclei per fibre, a smaller muscle fibre cross‐sectional area, reduced capillarisation and reduced phospholipid species. In addition, RNA sequencing revealed lower gene expression of pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in patients with PCC. Our morphological and electrophysiological findings indicate both neurogenic and myopathic involvement in the muscle tissue of PCC patients. The neurogenic component is evident in small clusters of atrophic angular fibres, as well as the presence of nuclear clumps and fetal MyHC, all of which indicate a scattered loss of motor units, characteristic of denervation [ 19 20 21 22 23 21 The myopathic involvement is supported by our previous reports of myopathic indices on needle EMG in > 60% of PCC patients [ 6 7 24 20 25 26 27 + 8 9 6 28 29 The overall lower fibre CSA in PCC patients seemed to be driven primarily by type 2 fibres, which are particularly susceptible to disuse [ 30 6 8 10 31 9 The tendency for lower NADH‐TR activity in type 2 fibres in our PCC patients compared to controls suggests impaired mitochondrial oxidative capacity, which may contribute to impaired ATP production and thus premature glycolytic fibre fatigue and reduced power output [ 6 32 33 9 10 10 9 34 35 36 Another indication of metabolic changes was that PCC patients had a lower capillary‐to‐fibre ratio in both fibre types compared to controls, which is crucial for efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle fibres. These findings were consistent with lower capillary contacts and capillary‐to‐fibre perimeter exchange. A reduced capillary‐to‐fibre ratio can impair mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation and muscle function, ultimately contributing to muscle atrophy, reduced strength and lower exercise capacity [ 37 38 39 40 41 6 8 9 p While this study provides valuable insight into skeletal muscle changes in PCC patients, there are some limitations that should be acknowledged. The morphological analysis showed a large variability between subjects, which may reflect the relatively high random error associated with histochemical analysis of muscle biopsies [ 42 6 6 6 5 Conclusions Our results show that PCC is associated with peripheral impairment and suggest possible skeletal muscle involvement in nonhospitalised, previously healthy patients with persistent PEM symptoms and reduced exercise capacity and muscle strength. The analysis indicated overall muscle fibre atrophy, downregulation of genes related to reduced oxidative capacity, lower phospholipids and lower capillarisation. These effects may primarily be explained by the lower activity level in this cohort. In contrast, the histopathological changes, such as atrophic angular and round‐formed fibres, inflammation, fibrosis and increased presence of fibres expressing fetal myosin, are likely more specific consequences of the postviral state. Measures should be taken to cautiously improve physical activity in this cohort to counteract further muscle atrophy and functional decline.
