Introduction Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) comprise diverse natural and synthetic compounds that capable of perturbing hormonal signaling and endocrine homeostasis across a wide spectrum of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 7 13 14 6 15 16 LNG—a 19-nortestosterone-derived synthetic progestin—has garnered particular scrutiny owing to its high receptor affinity, physicochemical stability, and environmental ubiquity [ 8 17 9 18 19 Exposure-based studies in both fish and amphibians have demonstrated that LNG and structurally related gestagens impair critical reproductive processes, including sexual differentiation [ 10 15 20 21 22 Pimephales promelas 23 24 D. rerio 25 Xenopus laevis 15 26 19 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 X. laevis 26 35 36 37 38 39 Beyond established endocrine effects, mounting evidence suggests that their toxicological scope encompasses non-reproductive pathways, as pro-oxidant activity, perturbations of cellular redox balance and mitochondrial integrity [ 40 41 42 43 40 44 40 45 A comprehensive understanding of tissue-specific alterations must account for embryogenesis, a developmental stage marked by heightened susceptibility of endocrine and morphogenetic pathways. Compelling evidence indicates that LNG compromised Zebrafish embryogenesis at multiple levels of biological organization. Parental exposure reduces survival, growth, and normal development even in unexposed progeny [ 46 47 48 pgr ar mr gr hsd17ß3 49 cyp19a1b 33 37 27 per1a nr1d2a 50 24 The oxidative impairments of synthetic gestagens, as evidenced by elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and compromised antioxidant enzyme activity in Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus Carassius auratus 51 52 53 40 41 Mactra veneriformis 5 Chlorogonium elongatum 54 Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, has emerged as a transformative tool in environmental toxicology, offering data-driven approaches to predict toxicity with efficiency and mechanistic depth [ 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 Through ML approaches in forecasting toxicological outcomes, Zebrafish is the most popular candidate, due to their ability to model complex [ 68 69 70 71 72 With oxidative disturbances increasingly attributed to LNG, key mechanistic uncertainties remain in our understanding of its dose-dependent, time-resolved, and tissue-specific impacts in aquatic vertebrates. By coupling redox-sensitive biomarker analysis with supervised machine learning, this work intends to deepen mechanistic insight into LNG-induced redox disruption and to develop a robust predictive platform for ecotoxicological risk evaluation in freshwater realms as an inaugural application. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Empirical Toxicology Dataset An empirical toxicology dataset was generated through static exposure trials implemented under regulated laboratory settings to ensure procedural consistency to evaluate the sublethal effects of LNG on adult Zebrafish. Fish were exposed to two environmentally relevant concentrations of LNG (0.312 and 6.24 µg/L) including a solvent-treated control group across three defined time points (24, 48, and 96 h) and data collection encompassed key biomarkers—including SOD, CAT, GPx, and MDA—sampled from liver and muscle tissues pertinent to oxidative stress and toxicological assessment. All experiments were performed in triplicate and followed OECD guidelines and institutional animal care protocols to ensure reproducibility, statistical robustness, and data integrity. This dataset subsequently served as the basis for supervised machine learning models designed to predict oxidative stress outcomes based on integrated biochemical parameters. 2.2. Test Chemical The synthetic progestin LNG (C 21 28 2 v v 73 2.3. Maintenance of Zebrafish and Exposure Procedure Adult (1+ year-old) mixed-sex AB wild-type Zebrafish ( Danio rerio n 2 3 3 2 74 Table 1 ® Experimental fish were exposed to 0.312 µg/L (LNG-L) and 6.24 µg/L (LNG-H) for three exposure durations: 24, 48, and 96 h [ 75 v v 76 77 78 2.4. Tissue Sampling and Homogenization Procedure Sampling; upon each exposure period (24, 48, and 96 h), fish were euthanized via decapitation, in accordance with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals and Directive 2010/63/EU. Immediately after euthanasia, liver and muscle tissues were dissected from both control and treatment groups and individually snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and archived at −80 °C until subsequent quantification of oxidative stress biomarkers. Homogenization; liver and muscle tissue specimens previously archived at −80 °C were allowed to equilibrate at ambient temperature (approximately 20 °C) for 5 to 15 min to facilitate controlled thawing. Precisely 0.1 g of each sample was weighed and transferred into 900 µL of potassium chloride (KCl) buffer (140 mmol/L). Tissue homogenization was performed on ice using a glass–Teflon homogenizer to ensure complete cellular disruption while preserving enzymatic integrity. The homogenates were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min at +4 °C and supernatants were carefully collected and aliquoted into sterile microcentrifuge tubes (50 µL per assay) and immediately stored on ice until subsequent enzymatic analyses. All procedures were performed under cold conditions to minimize oxidative artifact formation and to preserve the fidelity of oxidative stress biomarkers. 2.5. Antioxidative/Oxidative Stress Biomarkers The activities of key antioxidant enzymes—SOD; (EC 1.15.1.1), CAT; (EC 1.11.1.6) and GPx; (EC 1.11.1.9)—were quantitatively assessed to evaluate oxidative stress responses. SOD activity was determined based on its ability to catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. This assay utilized xanthine and xanthine oxidase to generate superoxide radicals, which subsequently reacted with 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride, forming a red formazan dye. The degree of inhibition of this reaction was used to quantify SOD activity [ 79 2 2 2 2 80 81 + 2 2 The MDA levels of liver and muscle homogenates were determined by using MDA-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay [ 82 2.6. Statictics The observational data derived from the experimental trials were initially assessed for variance homogeneity, upon which the most appropriate analytical method was selected based on the distributional characteristics of the dataset. To facilitate intergroup (LNG-C, LNG-L and LNG-H) comparisons of distinct tissues (muscle and liver) across multiple exposure durations (24, 48, and 96 h), the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was employed using SPSS Statistics software (version 26.0). 2.7. Data Pre-Processing Prior to model development, the dataset underwent a comprehensive pre-processing workflow to ensure data quality, consistency, and suitability for ML analysis ( Figure 1 Categorical variables were first transformed into numerical format using label encoding ( Figure 1 83 To address missing values, targeted imputation strategies were applied ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and range, were computed to characterize the distribution of features. In addition, Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate linear and monotonic relationships among variables, respectively, and the Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess normality ( Figure 1 Feature scaling was then conducted using Min-Max normalization to rescale numerical attributes to a common range [0, 1], particularly to accommodate algorithms sensitive to differences in scale, such as MLP ( Figure 1 Finally, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to address class imbalance arising from uneven sample sizes among exposure groups ( Figure 1 84 2.8. Machine Learning (ML) Models A collection of supervised ML algorithms was employed to classify oxidative stress responses based on integrated biochemical markers. Each model was selected based on its unique capabilities in handling complex biological patterns. 2.8.1. Logistic Regression (LR) This algorithm is a fundamental statistical method that is employed to solve binary and multiclass classification problems. It is highly interpretable and computationally efficient due to the application of the logistic function, which models the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class. The robustness of logistic regression in managing linear relationships between independent and dependent variables has made it a widely used technique in a variety of fields, such as medical diagnosis and financial risk analysis [ 85 P ( y = 1 ∣ x ) = 1 1 + e − w T x + b It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable [ 86 2.8.2. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) The MLP is a class of feedforward artificial neural networks capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships within data through the use of one or more hidden layers. Each neuron in the network computes a weighted sum of its inputs and applies an activation function to introduce nonlinearity. A type of neural network capable of capturing complex relationships within the data by utilizing multiple layers and backpropagation techniques to optimize weights [ 87 z = ϕ ∑ i = 1 n   w i x i + b i i ϕ x = 1 1 + e − x ϕ ( x ) = m a x ( 0 , x ) MLPs are particularly suited for modeling high-dimensional toxicological data, as they can effectively learn complex patterns across biochemical input features [ 88 2.8.3. Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT) An advanced ensemble learning technique that sequentially builds DT, each aimed at correcting the errors of its predecessor. This method excels in reducing bias and variance, leading to improved predictive accuracy [ 89 90 91 92 F m ( x ) = F m − 1 ( x ) + γ m h m ( x ) It is known for high accuracy and flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships [ 89 2.8.4. Decision Tree (DT) DT are hierarchical, rule-based models commonly employed in supervised learning for both classification and regression tasks. These models operate by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets based on the values of input features. Each internal node represents a decision rule on a specific feature, while each leaf node corresponds to a final output label or value. In classification problems, the splitting of nodes is typically guided by impurity measures such as Information Gain or the Gini Index, which evaluate the homogeneity of the resulting subsets [ 93 G i n i  I n d e x = 1 − ∑ i = 1 c ( P i ) 2 Lower Gini values indicate purer nodes, thereby guiding the algorithm toward more informative splits. 2.8.5. Random Forest (RF) RF is an ensemble learning algorithm based on DT, designed for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing multiple DT during training, each fitted on a different bootstrap sample of the dataset using the bagging (bootstrap aggregating) technique [ 94 In classification tasks, each tree in the forest casts a vote for the predicted class, and the final decision is made by majority voting across all trees [ 95 y ˆ = arg m a x c ∈ C  ∑ t = 1 T  I h t x = c 2.9. Model Performance Evaluation To comprehensively assess the performance of the classification models, multiple evaluation metrics were calculated, including accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), specificity, F1-score, Cohen’s Kappa, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the ROC curve (AUROC). Model evaluation was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation, where the dataset was divided into ten equal parts—nine parts were used for training and one for testing in each iteration ( Figure 2 Accuracy indicates the overall proportion of correct predictions made by the following model: A c c u r a c y  ( 1 − E r r o r ) = T P ( T P + T N + F P + F N ) Precision, or positive predictive value (PPV), is the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives: P r e c i s i o n = T P ( T P + F P ) Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR), is the proportion of true positives among all actual positives: R e c a l l = T P ( T P + F N ) Specificity (true negative rate, TNR) measures the proportion of actual negatives correctly identified: S p e c i f i t y = T P ( T N + F P ) F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric in cases of class imbalance: F − M e a s u r e = 2 × P r e c i s i o n × R e c a l l P r e c i s i o n + R e c a l l Cohen’s Kappa (κ) is a chance-corrected metric of classification agreement. It considers the likelihood of agreement occurring by chance: ( κ ) = P 0 − P e 1 − P e P 0 P e Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reflects the average magnitude of prediction errors without considering their direction: M A E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n  y i − y ˆ i Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is more sensitive to larger errors due to squaring: R M S E = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n   y i − y ˆ i 2 AUROC (Area Under the ROC Curve) evaluates the model’s discriminative power between classes by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR): R O C = ∫ 0 1   ( T P / T P + F N ) ( F P / F P + T N ) ( x ) d x These performance indicators collectively provided a comprehensive view of classification effectiveness, reliability, and generalization across biochemical markers related to oxidative stress. To visually summarize the methodology employed in this study and enhance clarity regarding the analytical workflow, the diagram illustrates the key stages, including LNG exposure, biochemical analyses, data preprocessing, machine learning model development, and performance evaluation ( Figure 3 This integrative approach combines experimental toxicology and artificial intelligence techniques to predict oxidative stress responses induced by LNG. 3. Results 3.1. Empirical Outcomes for Antioxidant/Oxidant Biomarkers The findings presented herein are derived from empirical toxicological analyses designed to elucidate the tissue-specific, dose-dependent, and temporal dynamics of antioxidant and oxidant responses following LNG exposure in adult Zebrafish. SOD demonstrated distinct activity patterns across tissues, exposure durations, and LNG concentrations. The highest level of SOD was 384.25 U/mL for 24 h LNG-C group in liver tissue, followed by a gradual decline under prolonged exposure and remarkably the lowest hepatic SOD activity (117.00 U/mL) occurred in the 96 h LNG-C group. However, SOD activity progressively increased over time under high-dose exposure (LNG-H), peaking at 96 h (381.55 U/mL) for muscle tissue. This trend suggests a time-dependent upregulation of SOD activity under high oxidative load, particularly in muscle, while the liver showed early antioxidant mobilization followed by depletion or suppression with extended exposure. CAT activity under LNG-L declined at 24 and 48 h for muscle, with partial recovery at 96 h and a reduction was also noted at 24 h under LNG-L in liver tissue, but enzyme activity was elevated at 48 and 96 h, indicating delayed hepatic CAT induction. For exposure to LNG-H, CAT activity declined consistently across all time points in both tissues, suggesting dose-dependent enzymatic suppression, possibly due to oxidative damage exceeding enzymatic capacity. GPx showed a robust dose–time response in muscle tissue, GPx activity was modest at early time points but surged to 515.83 U/L at 96 h under LNG-H. The response was even more pronounced, with GPx activity reaching 1055.81 U/L at 96 h in the LNG-H group for liver samples. These results indicate a strong dose- and time-dependent induction of GPx, particularly in hepatic tissue, likely reflecting compensatory activation in response to sustained oxidative insult. Lipid peroxidation, measured via MDA levels, further supported these trends at 24 and 48 h and MDA levels were generally low in both LNG-C and exposed groups (LNG-L and LNG-H). However, at 96 h, muscle MDA increased following to LNG-L exposure, while unexpectedly declining under LNG-H—possibly reflecting antioxidant activation or lipid damage repair. MDA levels of liver specimens, for LNG-L were lower than in muscle, while LNG-H exposure produced comparable MDA levels across tissues, suggesting convergence of oxidative damage under prolonged, high-intensity exposure. These results highlight a dose- and tissue-specific sensitivity to peroxidative damage, with liver tissue exhibiting higher oxidative responsiveness. The time-resolved, dose-dependent, and tissue-specific patterns observed under LNG exposure underscore the capacity of this gestagen to induce oxidative stress through differential modulation of enzymatic defenses. 3.2. ML Model Outcomes The performance of individual ML models was assessed using a suite of classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), specificity, F1-score ( Table 2 Table 3 Categorical variables were processed via label encoding, preserving compatibility with tree-based algorithms. Missing values were imputed using distribution-aware strategies, maintaining data integrity and improving generalizability. Furthermore, feature scaling through normalization and standardization enabled efficient training convergence, particularly in algorithms sensitive to scale variations such as MLP. Among all tested classifiers, the GBT model demonstrated the best performance with 96.17% accuracy and a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.923, indicating both high precision and class discrimination. RF closely followed with 94.97% accuracy and a kappa value of 0.899, while the DT model showed satisfactory results (93.47%, κ = 0.868). In contrast, MLP and LR showed weaker performance, with LR displaying the lowest accuracy (82.06%) and kappa (0.642). These findings underscore the superior robustness and discriminative capacity of ensemble models, particularly GBT and RF, in modeling oxidative stress responses. GBT achieved the best performance in both muscle and liver tissue classification, with recall, precision, and F1-scores exceeding 96%. The RF model also yielded strong results, particularly in liver classification (F1 = 0.951), positioning it as a reliable alternative. In contrast, DT provided acceptable but slightly lower outcomes, while MLP and LR showed notably reduced predictive power—especially in muscle classification—with lower F1-scores. Table 4 2 2 Regression analysis with XGBoost revealed that both LNG concentration and exposure time significantly influenced oxidative stress biomarkers in Zebrafish liver. GPx emerged as the most responsive and reliable biomarker (R 2 2 In contrast to the regression-based findings, the classification analysis using ROC curves revealed that only GPx exhibited statistically significant discriminative power among the evaluated biomarkers. AUC values indicated that this significance was exclusive to liver tissue, confirming both the dose- and time-dependent responsiveness of GPx as well as its diagnostic value. While MDA displayed strong predictive capacity under regression modeling, it did not achieve statistical relevance in classification metrics. This discrepancy suggests that MDA is more indicative of chronic biochemical alterations rather than acute exposure-based class separation. As shown in Figure 4 ROC analysis revealed that GPx had the highest discriminative power (AUC = 0.922) in liver tissue, confirming its role as a sensitive and specific biomarker for LNG-induced oxidative damage. 3.3. Distributional Analysis of Oxidative Stress Biomarkers for Tissue and Dose Specifity In order to better understand the differential response patterns of oxidative stress biomarkers, both distributional (box plot) and density-based visualizations were employed across muscle and liver tissues ( Figure 5 The box plot analysis illustrated that liver tissues generally exhibited a broader range and higher variance for most biomarkers, particularly GPx and CAT, when compared to muscle tissues. GPx levels in the liver were markedly elevated with several extreme values, indicating a strong and variable antioxidant response. CAT also showed extensive variability in the liver, consistent with its irregular temporal behavior. To further investigate the kinetic patterns of biomarker expression, density plots were generated for each marker using the full dataset (n = 1164). These plots revealed biomarker-specific trends and modality differences that could not be fully captured by summary statistics alone ( Figure 6 The time-based density analysis revealed that each biomarker exhibited distinct response kinetics across the 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h exposure intervals. SOD showed a sharp early peak at 24 h, followed by a decline at 48 h and partial recovery at 96 h. This pattern, together with the bimodal distribution observed at all time points, supports its role as a rapid oxidative stress responder subject to phase-dependent regulation during prolonged exposure. CAT displayed a two-phase activation profile. An early increase at 24 h was followed by a modest redistribution at 48 h and relatively stable activity at 96 h. These fluctuations suggest that CAT activity involves both immediate and sustained components, likely modulated by context-dependent activation and post-translational control mechanisms. GPx exhibited the most prominent delayed-phase response. Activity was comparatively lower at 24 h but increased progressively at 48 h and 96 h, with broader distributions indicative of extended antioxidant engagement during later exposure stages. This pattern reinforces its role as a key defense enzyme in the late phase of oxidative stress. MDA showed marked early-phase elevations at 24 h and 48 h, followed by a moderate decline and broader distribution at 96 h. This trend suggests strong lipid peroxidation during the initial exposure stages, with partial attenuation over time, consistent with its role as an indicator of both acute and sustained oxidative damage. Taken together, these time-based profiles indicate that SOD functions as an early-phase oxidative stress sentinel, CAT demonstrates dual-phase activation, GPx predominates during late-phase antioxidant defense, and MDA reflects early and persistent lipid peroxidation. These distinct patterns underscore the importance of integrating time-course resolution into biomarker-based toxicological modeling. To further illustrate these differences, a series of heatmaps was generated ( Figure 7 Distinct patterns emerged across biomarkers and GPx exhibited progressively increasing levels in liver tissue. MDA remained higher in muscle than in liver, with values decreasing over time in muscle and remaining relatively stable in liver. SOD showed high early-phase activity, particularly in muscle tissue, followed by a decrease at 48 h and partial recovery at 96 h. CAT presented a heterogeneous pattern, with muscle peaking early and liver peaking at 48 h. These visual trends support earlier statistical findings. The concentration-dependent modulation of oxidative stress biomarkers is depicted in Figure 8 SOD activity peaked in LNG-C but declined markedly in both LNG-H and LNG-L for the liver, while muscle SOD displayed greater variability under LNG-H, with slightly elevated medians in both exposure groups relative to control—suggesting tissue-specific SOD modulation. CAT activity displayed a consistent decline across both tissues in the treatment groups compared to controls and median CAT levels were highest in LNG-C, whereas LNG-H and LNG-L groups showed pronounced reductions for liver samples. In muscle tissue, CAT activity was similarly reduced in LNG-H, with partial recovery in LNG-L, indicating a possible adaptive response at lower exposure levels. For GPx activity, both liver and muscle tissues showed the highest median values in LNG-C. Exposure to LNG-H and LNG-L resulted in a significant reduction in GPx activity, with the high-dose group exhibiting the greatest variability, reflecting inter-individual differences in enzymatic antioxidant capacity under chemical stress. MDA concentrations were minimal for LNG-C groups, increased in both LNG-H and LNG-L, reflecting enhanced lipid peroxidation. Both exposure groups showed increased MDA levels, with numerous outliers indicating pronounced oxidative damage in certain individuals. Notably, liver MDA values in LNG-H demonstrated a broader distribution compared to LNG-L, whereas muscle MDA increases were comparable between the two exposure groups. 4. Discussion Based on the present data, LNG exposure unveiled profound interspecies divergence in oxidative stress enzyme dynamics, underlining species-specific antioxidant strategies and variable capacities to withstand xenobiotic-induced redox perturbations. High-dose LNG (6.24 µg/L) progressively elevated SOD activity in both liver and muscle, reflecting compensatory antioxidant upregulation under sustained oxidative stress for Zebrafish and Zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha 73 Ruditapes decussatus 41 8 9 Oryzias melastigma 40 M. veneriformis 5 45 96 42 44 GPx was strongly induced under LNG-H—particularly in the liver—aligning with NET-driven increases in marine medaka ( O. melastigma 40 40 45 M. veneriformis 5 96 MDA levels displayed greater hepatic sensitivity here, paralleling NET-induced increases in marine medaka and elevated TBARs in the grooved carpet clam ( R. decussatus 41 97 73 These biomarker trends provided the foundation for subsequent ML modeling, enabling predictive classification of LNG exposure scenarios and elucidation of tissue-specific oxidative trajectories with high temporal resolution. By coupling these experimental data with supervised ML algorithms, hepatic GPx emerged as the most sensitive and diagnostically informative biomarker. Among the algorithms tested, GBT achieved the highest classification accuracy (96.17%), and liver GPx yielded the highest ROC-AUC (0.922), outperforming muscle tissue markers. Furthermore, XGBoost regression modeling revealed a strong dose- and time-dependent relationship for liver GPx (R 2 These results are particularly significant in light of prior research that has characterized endocrine and enzymatic disruptions following LNG exposure—such as altered CAT expression—but has largely overlooked tissue-specific oxidative stress biomarkers and computational modeling approaches [ 28 96 Comparable findings have been reported by Wang et al. [ 98 More broadly, ML applications in Zebrafish toxicology are increasingly being adopted to evaluate chemical-induced outcomes across a range of endpoints. For example, Wang et al. [ 67 70 72 These trends are echoed in comprehensive reviews by Macrae and Peterson [ 69 71 In parallel, multiple studies have demonstrated the versatility of ML for detecting and quantifying oxidative stress in Zebrafish. As a case in point, unsupervised clustering methods like UPGMA have been used to analyze Zebrafish locomotor patterns [ 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 To further contextualize our findings, we compiled recent literature exploring both the biological and computational responses to LNG and similar endocrine-disrupting chemicals in Zebrafish ( Table 5 toxics-13-00764-t005_Table 5 Table 5 Recent studies on LNG Toxicity and ML-Based Prediction for Zebrafish.

A further dimension requiring emphasis is, although, defining safe usage thresholds is critical for contextualizing the toxicity of LNG in aquatic ecosystems, a critical point emerging from the current body of knowledge is that LNG can exhibit deleterious impacts at extremely low concentrations with risk quotients often exceeding unity in surface waters. As summarized in Oropesa and Guimarães [ 48 109 110 111 112 5. Conclusions The inherent complexity and nonlinearity of tissue-specific trajectories highlight the necessity of predictive modeling to disentangle dose- and organ-dependent patterns. Integrating empirical biochemical profiling with such modeling not only facilitates the early detection of progestin-driven redox perturbations—often undetectable by conventional toxicological endpoints—but also enhances prediction accuracy and elucidates the variable contributions within classification frameworks. This methodological synergy underscores the value of advanced machine learning in data-rich biological contexts. Looking ahead, the incorporation of transcriptomic or proteomic datasets could further refine biomarker specificity, enhance cross-species applicability, and bolster environmental monitoring strategies for endocrine-active contaminants in freshwater ecosystems.
