The pro-angiogenesis of NSUN2 depends on AKAP2 activation.

Remarkably, knockdown of ALYREF in vascular ECs exhibited a significant decrease in proliferation rate (Fig. S6 S6 S6 5 According to the current model of vessel sprouting, a leading tip cell migrates into avascular regions, while proliferating stalk cells elongate the emerging sprout. Upon fusion of 2 adjacent newly formed sprouts, ECs differentiate into quiescent phalanx cells [ 32 33 14 5 34 30 5 S7 Additionally, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was employed to suppress AKAP2 5 5 Lactate dehydrogenase A-mediated histone lactylation enhances the excessive expression of NSUN2 Due to the glycolytic addiction presented in ECs [ 16 6 17 6 6 6 GSE267661 6 35 6 6 36 6 S8 6 37 R P −8 6 R P S9 Fig. 6.

Fig. 7. Schematic diagram of this study. Activation of transcription by H3K18la in ECs resulted in an increase in m 5 Discussion In this study, we elucidate the pathological mechanisms of NSUN2-dependent m 5 5 Nsun2 flox/flox Nsun2 Nsun2 −/− 5 5 7 NSUN2 is playing an increasingly pivotal role in endothelial dysfunction under pathological conditions. NSUN2 promotes vascular endothelial inflammation by methylating intercellular adhesion molecule 1 mRNA to mediate endothelial-leukocyte adhesion [ 38 39 5 40 42 Accumulating evidence demonstrates a close interplay between histone epigenetic modifications and RNA methylation [ 43 45 44 46 24 6 1 17 23 47 6 1 AKAP2, a scaffolding protein that isolates PKA to specific subcellular locations by binding to its regulatory subunit, potentially functions to coordinate multiple components of the signal transduction pathway [ 48 49 30 The H3K18la–NSUN2–AKAP2 axis presents novel therapeutic opportunities for CNV and other vascular proliferative disorders, potentially offering unique benefits for patients with suboptimal responses to current anti-VEGF therapies. Given the initiating role of lactate, strategies targeting LDHA warrant exploration for CNV treatment [ 50 Nonetheless, several limitations of our study must be acknowledged, as they currently constrain its clinical translation. Although our study provides a comprehensive characterization of lactate-driven CNV pathogenesis via the NSUN2–AKAP2–VEGFR2 axis, identification of the precise m 5 5 Methods CNV model and EC-specific NSUN2-knockout animals C57BL/6J mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were obtained from the Model Animal Research Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment. After deep anesthesia and dilation of the pupils, 3 to 5 laser photocoagulations (532 nm, 475 mW, 50 ms, and 50-μm spot size) on the right eye around the optic nerve of each mouse were performed to generate the CNV model. The presence of a bubble at the site of laser injury indicates the rupture of Bruch’s membrane and confirms the successful establishment of the CNV model. Animal ethics were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Ninth People’s Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SH9H-2024-A951-SB). The conditional Nsun2 Nsun2 flox/flox Nsun2 flox/flox Cell culture and transduction HUVECs were purchased from ScienCell (USA). Primary human CEC cultures were obtained as previously described [ 51 ECs were cultured in EC medium (ScienCell, USA) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (ScienCell, USA), 1% EC growth supplement (ScienCell, USA), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (ScienCell, USA) at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 2 shRNAs targeting NSUN2, LDHA, LDHB, ALYREF, EP300, and AKAP2, along with an AKAP2 overexpression plasmid, were purchased from Genomeditech Corporation. The cells were transfected in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The oligonucleotide sequences employed are presented in Table S1. RPE–choroid complex and fluorescence imaging As previously described [ 52 For fluorescence imaging, the RPE–choroid complex was blocked with 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline–Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h, followed by staining overnight at 4 °C using DyLight 594 Labeled GSL l-isolectin B4 (Maokang Bio, China) or CD31 (Proteintech, China). After cleaning the complexes with a blocking solution, images were acquired and quantified using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). Fundus examinations As previously described [ 53 Statistical analysis Quantification data are presented as the mean ± SD.
