Through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations, the approach demonstrates the ability to significantly reduce oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis, and aneurysm progression. These findings offer a promising foundation for the development of molecular‐targeted therapies utilizing mRNA‐loaded nanovesicles for vascular diseases like AAA. 1 INTRODUCTION Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common and deadly vascular disease characterized by localized dilation of the abdominal aorta. If left untreated, it may lead to fatal arterial rupture.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15 Ferroptosis, as a novel form of cell death, has recently garnered attention in AAA research.  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  15  26  15  26 The nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (NRF2)/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) axis plays a crucial regulatory role in cellular responses to oxidative stress and ferroptosis.  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  27  29  34 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have superior drug encapsulation and delivery capabilities,  35  36  37  38  39  36  40  41  42  43  44  45 The aim of this study is to utilize biomimetic nanovesicles loaded with PEBP1 mRNA to activate the NRF2/GPX4 axis, inhibit ferroptosis in VSMCs, and prevent the formation of AAA. By validating the efficacy of this novel therapy through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we aim to provide a new strategy for molecular targeted therapy of AAA. Initially, we conducted differential gene expression analysis using AAA‐related transcriptomic datasets downloaded from the GEO database to identify key genes associated with ferroptosis. Subsequently, through single‐cell data analysis, we delved into the molecular characteristics of VSMCs in AAA to confirm the role of PEBP1 in regulating ferroptosis. In vitro experiments were conducted to validate the successful encapsulation and expression of PEBP1 mRNA in nanovesicles and its biological effects in VSMCs. Finally, animal model experiments were carried out to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of nanovesicles on the progression of AAA. This study not only deepens our understanding of the pathogenesis of AAA but also provides potential preventive and therapeutic approaches for clinical application, holding significant scientific research value and clinical prospects. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Public data download We obtained transcriptome data related to AAA from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GSE57691 GSM1386783 GSM1386831 GSM1386841 GSM1386850 For single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) data on AAA, dataset GSE237230 GSM7597523 GSM7597525 GSM7597527 GSM7597529 As these data originate from a publicly available database, there is no requirement for ethical approval or informed consent. 2.2 Differential expression analysis Differential expression analysis was performed using the high‐throughput transcriptomic data from the GEO dataset. Genes showing |log2FoldChange| > 1 and p 2.3 Selection of ferroptosis‐related genes A list of known ferroptosis‐related genes was obtained from the FerrDb database ( http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb 2.4  scRNA In order to reduce the dimensionality of the scRNA‐Seq dataset, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the expression profiles of the top 2000 highly variable genes based on variance. The top 20 principal components were selected for downstream analysis using the Elbowplot function in the Seurat software package. Batch correction of the sample data was carried out using the Harmony package, and the principal components (PCs) were ranked by standard deviation using the ElbowPlot. The FindClusters function provided by Seurat was employed to identify main cell subgroups with a default resolution set at res = 1. Subsequently, the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm was utilized to reduce the non‐linear dimensionality of the scRNA‐seq sequencing data. Markers for various cell subgroups were identified using the Seurat software package. Annotating the cells was accomplished by leveraging known cell lineage‐specific marker genes and the CellMarker online database in conjunction with the “SingleR” package. The FindAllMarkers function was employed to analyze the characteristic genes in each cell type after clustering, with a threshold of p 2.5 Cell extraction and cultivation Primary VSMCs were isolated from the aorta of AAA model mice (for subsequent animal modeling) through the following process. Mice were euthanized with isoflurane inhalation, and the entire aortic section was dissected. The outer membrane was carefully removed after a continuous 30‐min digestion at 37°C with 347 U/mg of Type II collagenase (C2‐BIOC, Sigma‐Aldrich, USA). The endothelium was removed by gently rubbing with a sterile cotton‐tipped applicator, and the aorta was diced into small pieces. Subsequently, a mixture of 347 U/mg collagenase II and 6 U/mg elastase IV (E0258, Sigma‐Aldrich, USA) was used for a 30‐min digestion at 37°C. The cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, 11965092, Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, A5670701, Gibco, USA), 1% smooth muscle growth supplement (S00725, Gibco, USA), and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (15140148, Gibco, USA). Identification of the cells was conducted using α‐Smooth Muscle Actin (α‐SMA) staining, a specific marker for VSMCs, revealing that over 98% of the cells were α‐SMA positive.  46 2.6 Cell lentiviral transfection Lentivirus infection: The packaging virus and the target vector were co‐transfected into Human Embryonic Kidney 293T cells (HEK293T, CBP60661, Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China) using Lipofectamine 2000 (11668500, Invitrogen™). After 48 h of cell culture, the supernatant was collected, which contained viral particles after filtration and centrifugation. The virus was collected during the exponential growth phase, and the viral titer was determined. Lentivirus overexpressing PEBP1 was constructed and packaged by GeCai Gene, with the lentivirus gene overexpression vector being LV‐PDGFRA. During the logarithmic growth phase of VSMCs, they were digested using trypsin, dissociated, and prepared into a cell suspension at a concentration of 5 × 10 4 8 7 6  47 Cell grouping: The cells were divided into four groups: oe‐NC group (infected with lentivirus overexpressing empty vector), oe‐PEBP1 group (infected with lentivirus overexpressing PEBP1), PBS group (treated with phosphate‐buffered saline), EVs group (untreated mRNA‐loaded EVs for 48 h), and PEBP1‐EVs group (treated with 20 μg of PEBP1‐EVs for 48 h).  48 2.7 Cell immunofluorescence Cells were rinsed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (P885233, Macklin, Shanghai, China) for 15–30 min. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 0.1% Triton (L885651, Macklin, Shanghai, China) for 15 min to permeabilize the cell membrane. After two PBS washes, the cells were cultured in PBS containing 15% FBS at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit monoclonal antibody anti‐α‐SMA (ab150301, 1 μg/mL, Abcam, UK), followed by a 1‐h incubation with goat anti‐rabbit IgG H&L (FITC) (ab6717, 1:200, Abcam, UK). After three PBS washes, the cells were incubated with DAPI (ab104139, 1:1000, Abcam, UK) for 10 min, followed by three PBS washes. Cell immunofluorescence was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Observer Z1, Germany). Five randomly selected fields were chosen to calculate the ratio of α‐SMA‐positive cells per field, and the mean value was determined. 2.8 Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis Total RNA was extracted from cells in each group using the Trizol reagent kit (T9424, Sigma‐Aldrich). The quality and concentration of RNA were determined using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (ND‐1000, Nanodrop, USA). For mRNA expression analysis, reverse transcription was performed using the PrimeScript™ RT kit (RR014B, TaKaRa, Japan). Real‐time RT‐qPCR was carried out on an ABI 7500 PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) using the TB Green® Premix Ex TaqTM kit (RR420W, TaKaRa, Japan) with the sequences detailed in Table 1 −ΔΔCt TABLE 1 RT‐qPCR primer sequences.

After 15 min of lysis at 4°C, the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g 2.10 Cell counting kit‐8 assay VSMCs were subjected to experiments using the cell counting kit‐8 (CCK‐8) (Beyotime, C0037, Shanghai, China). The cells were seeded in a 96‐well plate and treated, with 10 μL of CCK‐8 solution added to each well at 24, 48, and 72 h. Subsequently, the cells were further incubated for 1 h, and the absorbance of the cells at a wavelength of 450 nm was measured using the BioTek ELx808 microplate reader (Biotek, USA). Each group was performed with six replicates, and the experiment was repeated three times for reliability. 2.11 Flow cytometry analysis VSMCs were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 5 2.12 Measurement of ROS The level of ROS in VSMCs was determined using the DCFH‐DA fluorescence staining method. VSMCs (5 × 10 4 2.13 Determination of Fe 2+ The supernatant from cell culture medium in each group was collected, and the iron levels in the cells were measured using an iron assay kit (ab83366, Abcam, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. 2.14 Observation of mitochondrial damage using transmission electron microscopy Mitochondrial damage in VSMCs was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Samples were fixed overnight in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution at 4°C, followed by fixation in a 1% osmium tetroxide solution for 1–2 h at room temperature. Dehydration was carried out with graded ethanol (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 95%), followed by treatment with pure acetone and overnight embedding in pure embedding resin. The samples were then embedded after undergoing permeation treatment. Subsequently, the embedded samples were heated at 70°C overnight to obtain properly embedded samples. Thin sections of the samples were cut using the UM10 ultramicrotome (Jiangsu Leibo Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., China), stained with lead citrate solution and 50% ethanol‐saturated uranyl acetate for 15 min each, enabling observation under the transmission electron microscope. Mitochondrial status was assessed by TEM, based on membrane integrity and cristae structure. 2.15 Enrichment of EVs VSMCs were harvested and subjected to conditioned culture. The cells were centrifuged at 300 × g g g g g 2.16  mRNA EVs PEBP1 mRNA designed by Trilink company was synthesized and obtained. Initially, purified mRNA was prepared for loading, followed by the addition of lipid‐coated mRNA into the EVs through a mixing and incubation process. Subsequently, the Gene Pulser Xcell™ electroporation system (Bio‐Rad, USA) was utilized with settings at 200 V and 950 μF for electroporation. After electroporation, the samples were left to recover at room temperature for 30 min to facilitate mRNA encapsulation. 2.17  mRNA The encapsulation efficiency was determined using RiboGreen RNA ( R11490 For all groups, the mRNA encapsulation efficiency was greater than 85%.  49  50 2.18 Characterization of nanovesicles Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA): EVs were diluted in PBS at a ratio of 1:100. The prepared EV samples were placed in the Nanosight LM10‐HS system (Malvern Panalytical). For each EV sample, the system recorded a 30‐s video to capture the movement trajectories of EV particles in PBS, repeating this process three times. TEM: 10 μL of PEBP1‐EVs suspension was fixed in 4% PFA and then air‐dried onto electron microscopy grids coated with formvar carbon. Subsequently, staining was performed with 3% phosphotungstic acid (G1871, Soleibao) for 5 min. Finally, EV morphology was thoroughly observed and analyzed using the JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope. Surface marker identification was performed using WB analysis. The protein content was determined and standardized using the BCA protein assay kit (23227, Thermo Fisher, USA). A protein concentration of 50 μg/mL was used in the experiment. SDS–PAGE gels were prepared for protein denaturation and electrophoresis. Subsequently, transfer was carried out, and the expression of EVs marker proteins CD63 (ab315108, Abcam, UK) and CD81 (ab109201, Abcam, UK) was detected, along with the common contaminant endoplasmic reticulum protein Calnexin (ab22595, Abcam, UK) as a negative control to ensure extraction purity. 2.19 Stability detection of mRNA We stored mRNA‐loaded biomimetic nanovesicles at 4°C for 28 days. The stability was monitored every 7 days using particle size and Zeta potential measurements.  51 2.20 Uptake of nanovesicles Purified EVs were labeled with PKH67 green fluorescent dye (D0031, Solarbio, Beijing, China). The PKH67 dye was diluted in Diluent C (10‐fold dilution) to prepare a fresh dye solution. Subsequently, the PEBP1‐EVs suspension was mixed with the dye solution at room temperature and incubated for 10 min, followed by the addition of 2 mL of PBS containing 1% FBS to terminate the staining process. The labeled EVs were co‐incubated with VSMCs/HEK293T (3 × 10 5 2.21 Establishment of an AAA All animal experiments in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. All procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the “Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and the ARRIVE guidelines ( https://arriveguidelines.org/arrive-guidelines  47  52 Twenty‐four male C57BL/6J mice aged 5–6 months were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. The mice were housed in IVC cages under specific pathogen‐free (SPF) conditions in a facility maintained at a temperature of 22–26°C and a relative humidity of 45%–60%. Standard food and water were provided ad libitum. The light–dark cycle was set to 12 h each. The mice were initially randomly divided into four groups: Sham, AAA, AAA + EVs, and AAA + PEBP1‐EVs. The Sham group received 0.9% NaCl, while the AAA group received CaCl 2 2 2 10  53  54 2.22 Evaluation of maximum abdominal aortic diameter by echocardiography Echocardiographic assessments were conducted using the Vevo 2100 console (Visual Sonics Vevo 2100, FUJIFILM, Bothell, WA, USA) to analyze the vascular diameter at 28 days post‐modeling. B‐mode ultrasound data of the diastolic aorta were obtained with a transducer (MS550D) operating at a central frequency of 40 MHz and a focal length of 7 mm for imaging the murine abdominal aorta. Analysis was performed using ultrasound statistical software to measure the maximum dilated segment of the aorta. Arterial aneurysm formation was defined as an increase of at least 50% in the outer width of the suprarenal aorta. 2.23 Hematoxylin and eosin staining The abdominal aortas of each group of mice were collected, exposed, and photographed after removing surrounding tissues under a dissecting microscope. Subsequently, the abdominal aortas were fixed in 4% PFA (P0099, Shanghai Biyun Tian Biotechnology Co., Ltd). The aortas were sectioned into 7 μm thick slices for further analysis. The prepared sections were stained in hematoxylin solution (H8070, Solarbio, Beijing, China) for 5–10 min at room temperature. After rinsing the slides with distilled water, they were dehydrated in 95% ethanol, immersed in eosin solution (G1100, Solarbio, Beijing, China) for 5–10 min, and underwent routine dehydration, clearing, and mounting for microscopic observation. 2.24 Tissue immunofluorescence detection of EVs To investigate the internalization of biomimetic nanovesicles in the aortic wall of mice, 5 ×9  47 2.25 ELISA Mouse sera were collected, and levels of C‐reactive protein (CRP) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) were measured using Mouse ELISA kits for CRP (ab222511, Abcam, UK) and MMP2 (ab254516, Abcam, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. 2.26 Statistical analysis The data, obtained from at least three independent experiments, are presented as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD).

The expression patterns of these genes in the AAA group reveal the potential role of ferroptosis‐related genes in the development of AAA. 3.2 Single‐cell analysis reveals the key role of PEBP1 AAA In the aforementioned transcriptional chip analysis of AAA, we identified 12 ferroptosis‐related genes that regulate AAA. To gain a deeper understanding of the cellular heterogeneity in AAA and identify crucial ferroptosis‐related genes, we acquired the AAA single‐cell transcriptome chip GSE237230 S1 r r S1 Following this, we further analyzed the filtered cells and initially normalized the data. Subsequently, based on the selected highly variable genes, we performed linear dimensionality reduction using PCA (Figure S1 S1 We conducted batch correction on the sample data using the Harmony package and performed standard deviation‐based ordering of PCs through an Elbow Plot (Figure S1 S2 S2 S2 Subsequently, we utilized the Bioconductor/R software package “SingleR” in conjunction with manual annotation to automatically annotate the 18 cell clusters, resulting in the identification of 10 cell types: Neutrophils, T cells, NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, B cells, VSMCs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and plasma cells (Figure 2a 2b 2c FIGURE 2 Single‐cell expression characterization of ferroptosis‐related genes in AAA.

PEBP1, as the sole intersecting gene, shows significantly reduced expression in AAA and is known to possess ferroptosis‐inhibiting properties, suggesting its potentially pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AAA. 3.3  PEBP1 VSMCs ROS Based on the aforementioned bioinformatics analysis, we identified gene expression characteristics related to ferroptosis in AAA. PEBP1 was the only gene in the intersection, showing significantly low expression in AAA. Known for its role in inhibiting ferroptosis, PEBP1's reduced expression in AAA implies its potential crucial involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease. Primary VSMCs were isolated from mouse aortas, and immunofluorescence staining of α‐SMA (a VSMC‐specific marker) revealed that over 98% of cells were α‐SMA positive (Figure S3 3a 8 S3 3b 3c,d FIGURE 3 PEBP1 modulates ferroptosis and proliferation apoptosis in VSMCs by inhibiting ROS and iron levels.

After 4 weeks of treatment, the average diameter of the aneurysm decreased compared to pre‐treatment, and the shape became more regular, indicating that the nanovesicles effectively inhibited the progression of the aneurysm (Figure 6b,c At the molecular level, RT‐qPCR and WB results indicate that compared to the Sham group, the expression levels of PEBP1 mRNA, NRF2, and GPX4 proteins in the abdominal aortic tissues of mice in the AAA group were significantly decreased. Conversely, compared to the AAA + EVs group, the expression levels of PEBP1 mRNA, NRF2, and GPX4 proteins in the abdominal aortic tissues of mice in the AAA + PEBP1‐EVs group were significantly higher than those in the control group (Figure 6d,e Furthermore, the therapeutic effects were further validated through histological analysis and detection of serum biomarkers. H&E staining of the abdominal aortic tissues revealed that compared to the Sham group, mice in the AAA group exhibited inflammation, tissue damage, and increased vascular wall thickness. In contrast, the treatment group showed a more intact arterial wall structure, significantly reduced inflammation and tissue damage, and decreased vascular wall thickness (Figure 6f 6g 6h In conclusion, the above results further demonstrate that PEBP1‐EVs can inhibit the NRF2/GPX4 axis, thereby alleviating the development of AAA. 4 DISCUSSION This study utilized biomimetic nanovesicles loaded with PEBP1 mRNA to activate the NRF2/GPX4 axis and suppress ferroptosis in VSMCs, aiming to prevent the formation of AAA. The research not only elucidates the significant role of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of AAA but also proposes a novel molecular‐targeted therapeutic approach. Our key findings demonstrate that overexpression of PEBP1 can promote VSMC proliferation, inhibit intracellular ROS and iron levels, decrease cell apoptosis, and prevent ferroptosis by activating the NRF2/GPX4 axis. This innovative research avenue offers a potential molecular targeted strategy for the prevention and treatment of AAA. Ferroptosis, a form of iron‐dependent cell death, has garnered increasing attention in the study of AAA in recent years.  23  24  25  62  63  64 The critical regulatory role of the NRF2/GPX4 axis in cellular antioxidant stress response and ferroptosis has been widely recognized.  27  28  29 Biomimetic nanovesicles, as a novel drug delivery system, exhibit excellent biocompatibility and targeting properties.  40  41  40  43  65 The results of both in vitro and in vivo experiments mutually corroborate, further supporting the effectiveness of PEBP1 mRNA in nanovesicles. In the in vitro experiments, we observed successful expression of PEBP1 mRNA and activation of the NRF2/GPX4 axis, leading to the inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis in VSMCs. Additionally, the expression of the PEBP1/NRF2/GPX4 axis was verified through techniques such as fluorescence confocal microscopy, RT‐qPCR, and WB analysis. In the in vivo experiments, nanovesicle treatment significantly suppressed the progression of AAA in mice, a conclusion supported by both ultrasound detection and histological analysis. Compared to previous studies, the experimental design in this study is more rigorous, the data is more reliable, and the results are more persuasive. Compared to other molecular targeting therapeutic strategies, the PEBP1/NRF2/GPX4 axis activation strategy proposed in this study offers significant advantages. Prior treatment strategies for AAA have mainly focused on aspects such as anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and matrix remodeling. However, this study, through the inhibition of ferroptosis, introduces a new pathway for AAA treatment. Furthermore, the application of biomimetic nanovesicles as a drug delivery system enhances the targeting and effectiveness of treatment. Our research findings indicate that the PEBP1/NRF2/GPX4 axis activation strategy is not only effective under laboratory conditions but also holds promise for significant clinical impact in the future. This study discovered that biomimetic nanovesicles loaded with PEBP1 mRNA effectively activate the NRF2/GPX4 axis, inhibiting ferroptosis in VSMCs, thereby preventing the formation of AAA. This novel treatment provides a potential molecular targeting strategy for the prevention and treatment of AAA (Figure 7 FIGURE 7 Molecular mechanism diagram of PEBP1‐EVs activating the NRF2/GPX4 axis in anti‐ferroptosis pathway. This study innovatively applied biomimetic nanovesicles loaded with PEBP1 mRNA to elucidate the crucial role of the NRF2/GPX4 axis in inhibiting ferroptosis in VSMCs and preventing the formation of AAA. This finding not only enhances our understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis but also offers a novel direction for molecular targeted therapy of AAAs. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that PEBP1 mRNA efficiently expresses and exerts a protective effect in nanovesicles, providing a potential molecular target for AAA treatment. Clinically, this research lays the foundation for developing efficient and highly targeted novel therapeutic strategies, which could be validated in clinical trials in the future to prove their effectiveness and safety in the prevention and treatment of AAAs. While this study has made significant progress, some limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, the small sample size may restrict the generalizability and statistical significance of the results. Secondly, the experimental models primarily focused on animal studies, necessitating further preclinical research and clinical trials to validate the efficacy and safety in human patients. Additionally, the long‐term biocompatibility and stability of nanovesicles have not been fully assessed, requiring more studies to ensure their feasibility and safety in clinical applications. Additionally, this study primarily investigated the role of the PEBP1/NRF2/GPX4 axis in VSMCs, and future research should explore the applicability and mechanisms of this pathway in other cell types and vascular diseases. Finally, this study only used male mice, which may affect the generalizability of the results, particularly regarding the impact of sex differences on treatment response. Future studies should include both male and female mice to explore potential sex differences and their influence on the findings. Future research should focus on increasing sample sizes and diversifying experimental models to validate the universality and reliability of the findings of this study. Further optimization of the design of nanovesicles to enhance their stability and biocompatibility may promote their clinical application. Exploring the mechanisms of the PEBP1/NRF2/GPX4 axis in other vascular diseases may reveal additional therapeutic potential and application prospects. By conducting multicenter clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of biomimetic nanovesicles loaded with PEBP1 mRNA in AAA patients, the translation from experimental research to clinical application can be achieved. Additionally, combining other molecular‐targeted therapy strategies to develop comprehensive treatment plans holds the promise of further improving the prevention and treatment outcomes of AAAs.
