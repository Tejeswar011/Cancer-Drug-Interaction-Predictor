Introduction The global accessibility to modern medical care and an increase in the global average standard of life have resulted in significant advancements in the diagnosis and management of cancer [ 1 2 3 4 Tetraspanin 7 ( TSPAN7 5 TSPAN7 6 TSPAN7 7 8 TSPAN7 TSPAN7 TSPAN7 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Oncology Database Analysis Transcriptomic data from CRC and normal colon tissues were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The gene expression profile ( GSE62646 p p 2.2. Cell Culturing The human CRC cell lines (Caco2, SW180, HCT116, and HT29) and the normal human colon cell line (NCM460) were sourced from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). All these cell lines were cultivated in DMEM medium (Gibco, Waltham, USA) supplemented with FBS (10%, Gibco) and maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 2.3. Immunoblotting for Proteins Tissues and cell lines were processed and lysed in a lysis buffer (RIPA buffer) containing PMSF at 4°C, followed by centrifugation with high speed at 12,000 × g The primary antibody information is as follows: Anti‐ TSPAN7 2.4. Immunohistochemistry Study CRC tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3‐4 h and cut into precoated slides at a thickness of 2 mm. After dehydration, dewaxing, and hydration, primary antibody was added to the slides at 4°C overnight according to the instructions, and then secondary antibody was added and photographed under the microscope. 2.5. Cell Viability Analysis The viability of cells was determined by CCK‐8 assay. Briefly, 5000 cells per well were plated in 96‐well flat bottom plates followed by an addition of CCK‐8 assay reagent (1:10 of medium) at three different time points, including 24, 48, and 72 h. The cells were incubated for the duration of 1 h in the dark at RT. The color development was measured against the wavelength of 450 nm in a spectrophotometer. Cell viability calculations were performed by following the instructions provided in the reference. 2.6. Cell Scratch Assay Briefly, the cells were plated into 6‐well flat bottom plates, and once the cell confluency reached 90%, the cell monolayer was gently scraped by using a sterile tip of 200 μL pipette to form a uniform trace along the center of each well. After forming scratch, the wells were washed three times with PBS for the removal of floating cells, and the medium was refreshed by the fresh medium. The cells were then placed for 24 h in a CO 2 2.7. Cell Invasion Assay The experiment was performed in a 24‐well, 8 μm transwell cell culture chamber equipped with Matrigel‐coated culture plates. Cells were digested using 0.25% EDTA trypsin. The upper chamber was loaded with 200 μL cells, while the lower half of the wells contained 600 μL of media with 10% serum. Following a standard 24 h incubation period, the cells were fixed in methanol for a period of 30 min and stained with Giemsa for an additional 30 min. The remaining cells in the upper chamber were carefully extracted and positioned under an inverted microscope to enable the counting of the remaining cells. 2.8. Cell Transfection Cell transfection was conducted in a cell culture plate by seeding the desired quantity of cells into the wells and allowing them to attain a confluency of 50%. Once the desired confluency was reached, the cells underwent three washes with PBS. The siRNAs were designed using BLOCK‐iT RNAi Designer, targeting different regions of the TSPAN7 mRNA to ensure efficient knockdown. The sequences were verified for specificity by BLAST analysis to minimize off‐target effects. Chemically synthesized siRNAs were obtained from Ambion. A nontargeting siRNA was used as a negative control. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) and western blot 48 h post‐transfection. A solution of siRNA and Opti‐MEM (without FBS) was prepared with Lipofectamine 3000 with a final concentration of 100 nM. The prepared solution was then introduced to the cells and allowed to incubate for 6 h. Following incubation, the cell medium was refreshed by fresh media and the cells were further incubated for 48 h before further processing. 2.9. qRT‐PCR Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Vazyme Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using a reverse transcription kit to synthesize cDNA. qRT‐PCR was conducted using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) on ABI 7900 System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each reaction was conducted in triplicate, and gene expression changes were calculated using the 2−△△CT method. The primers used in this study were as follows:  TSPAN7: Forward: 5′‐ CTG​GTT​GCT​GGT​CTG​GTC​TT ‐3′; Reverse: 5′‐ AGG​CTT​GTC​CTT​GTC​CTC​CT‐3′. 2.10. Statistical Analysis All the results of this study were presented as mean ± SD. The results were statistically analyzed by GraphPad Prism 9 where Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. Bioinformatics Transcriptomic analysis was carried out on 132 CRC patients and 54 control individuals using the GEO database. A total of 145 significantly differentially expressed mRNAs were identified, with 47 mRNAs showing upregulation and 98 mRNAs displaying downregulation. The differential expression of genes was visually represented through a volcano plot. These differentially expressed RNAs were used for the prognostic assessment of survival of CRC patients. Forty‐two mRNAs were associated with good or poor survival prognosis of CRC patients (Supporting Table 1 1 CA1, CHP2, MMP1, CXCL8, HSD17B2, TSPAN7, MS4A12, SLC26A2, DHRS9, HSD11B2 TSPAN7 Figure 1 Bioinformatics analysis screened 10 key marker genes.

TSPAN7 In this study, we examined the effect of TSPAN7 overexpression on AMPK/mTOR signaling in CRC cells. We observed increased levels of phosphorylated AMPK (p‐AMPK) and upregulation of STK11 protein in TSPAN7‐overexpressing cells, suggesting that TSPAN7 may activate AMPK signaling via STK11. Although we did not directly assess phosphorylated mTOR (p‐mTOR) levels, total mTOR expression was decreased, implying a potential suppression of mTOR pathway activity. The proliferation of tumor cells is closely linked to their metabolic activity, with STK11 playing a key molecule in this mechanism.

Firstly, the study provides strong in vitro evidence but lacks in vivo experiments using animal models, limiting the understanding of TSPAN7 5. Conclusion This study demonstrates that TSPAN7 is downregulated in CRC and inhibits tumor cell proliferation and invasion. These effects are at least partially mediated through the STK11/AMPK signaling axis. TSPAN7 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for CRC.
