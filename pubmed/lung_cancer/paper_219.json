INTRODUCTION Despite the lack of evidence supporting an association between certain cigarette design features (e.g. filter ventilation) and harm reduction, such features often perpetuate false perceptions of safety among people who smoke. Evaluating how product characteristics shape perceptions and behaviors can help clarify these misconceptions and support the importance of restricting deceptive manufacturing. We explore relationships between cigarette design features and perceptions of smoothness and harm, as well as intention to quit. METHODS Cigarette brand/variety and consumer perceptions/behaviors data come from the 2019 ITC France Survey, which was administered to a nationally representative sample of French adults. This cross-sectional secondary analysis incorporated cigarette product information reported to the Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety in 2021. Logistic regression analyses were done using SPSS V27. RESULTS Greater own brand cigarette filter length (mm) (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.05–1.17) was significantly associated with higher odds of perceiving one’s own brand as smoother than other brands, while greater open pressure drop (mmWG) (AOR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.00–1.05) was associated with perceiving own-brand as safer than other brands. Respondents who described themselves as being in poor or fair health (vs good health) were more likely to perceive smooth/ultra (AOR=1.70; 95% CI: 1.22–2.37) and their own cigarettes (AOR=1.76; 95% CI: 1.05–2.95) as less harmful, as well as less likely to perceive their own brand as smoother (AOR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.47–0.93). Male (vs female) respondents were more likely to perceive smooth/ultra (AOR=1.88; 95% CI: 1.38–2.55) and their own cigarettes (AOR=1.89; 95% CI: 1.12–3.19) as less harmful. CONCLUSIONS We found evidence that certain design features and participant characteristics are associated with misconceptions regarding the smoothness and safety of cigarettes. These findings support greater monitoring of potentially deceptive product characteristics.

In fact, less saturated and brighter packaging has demonstrated consistency with greater filter ventilation 14 15 24 Several studies have demonstrated evidence that highly ventilated cigarettes are linked to perceptions of lower health risk 18 22 23 16 17 23 15 20 23 2 15 21 24 15 23 In recognition of these discrepant findings, further evaluation of the impact of product design features on characteristics and risk beliefs of people who smoke is warranted. In this analysis, we aim to explore the relationship between several design features and perceptions of smoothness and harm, as well as intention to quit smoking. We hypothesized that those using products with higher filter ventilation would perceive them as less harmful and smoother. METHODS ITC France survey This study is a cross-sectional, secondary data analysis of the ITC France Survey 25 26 26 Outcome measures We were interested in four primary outcomes related to cigarette product perceptions and behaviors. Relative harm was assessed by the item: ‘Do you think that the brand you usually smoke might be a little less harmful, no different, or a little more harmful, compared to other cigarette brands? [A little less harmful/No different/A little more harmful/Refused/Don’t know]’. Relative smoothness was assessed by: ‘Thinking about the cigarettes you usually smoke compared to other cigarettes, are your cigarettes harsher or smoother on your throat? [Harsher/About the same/Smoother /Refused/Don’t know]’. The perceived relationship between smoothness and harm was assessed by the item: ‘Do the words ‘smooth’ or ‘ultra’ in the name help to indicate whether a cigarette or roll-your-own brand could be less harmful compared to others? [Not at all/A little/Somewhat/A lot/Not applicable/Refused/Don’t know]’. Finally, participants reported whether they planned to quit smoking within the next month, 1–6 months from now, sometime in the future, or not planning to quit. Covariate measures Participants reported sex (male, female) and age was categorized into four groups (18–34; 35–44; 45–45; ≥55 years) for analysis. Cigarettes smoked per day were assessed as a number and categorized (<10; 11–20; ≥21) for analysis. Education level was categorized as low (less than high school), moderate (high school graduate/equivalent or some university), or high (university graduate or advanced degree) consistent with ITC procedures. Self-rated health was assessed as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor, dichotomized as fair or poor versus good or better for analysis. Cigarette design Under the European Union Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU), manufacturers are required to disclose specific product information to member states, via the EU Common Entry Gate 27 28 Product characteristics data were matched to ITC self-reported brand and variety. Of 2212 respondents in the survey, 1679 were adults (aged ≥18 years) who currently smoked cigarettes. Of these, 214 (12.7%) who used roll-your-own cigarettes exclusively were excluded. Of the remaining respondents, 1287 (88%) reported having a usual factory-made brand. Of these, 1039 (81%) reported using a cigarette brand that could be matched to a brand style from the ANSES list. Key reasons for lack of match were reporting a brand not on the ANSES list, or insufficient detail to match to a particular brand style (Supplementary file Table S1). Data analysis The analytic sample was characterized using descriptive statistics. Bivariate relationships among respondent demographic factors (age, gender, education level, cigarettes per day, perceived health status), cigarette characteristics, and outcome measures were assessed using cross-tabulations with chi-squared, ANOVA, or correlations. Variables for which bivariate relationships were significant were included in subsequent stepwise logistic regression models examining the effects of cigarette characteristics measures on outcomes, adjusting for demographic factors. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported, adjusted for all covariates included in the respective models. Additionally, a mediation analysis was performed using the Baron and Kenny approach to evaluate whether perceiving one’s own brand as smoother mediates the relationship between product design feature and perceiving one’s own brand as less harmful 29 RESULTS Table 1 Table 1 Participant characteristics and cigarette design features, 2019 ITC France Survey (N=1218)  Characteristics  n  % * Age 18–34 480 39.4 35–44 254 20.8 45–54 252 20.7 ≥55 232 19.0 Missing=0  Gender Male 630 51.7 Female 588 48.3 Missing=0  Education level Low (no education, some high school) 578 48.4 Moderate (completed high school, some university) 443 37.1 High (completed university, PhD and/or postdoctoral) 174 14.5 Missing=23  Cigarettes per day 0–10 665 55.5 11–20 442 36.9 ≥21 90 7.5 Missing=20  Perceived health status Poor or fair 370 31.4 Other (good, very good, or excellent) 807 68.6 Missing=41  Usual brand of factory-made cigarettes Marlboro 286 23.6 Winston 143 11.8 Lucky Strike 129 10.6 Philip Morris 116 9.5 Camel 109 9.0 Other 429 35.5 Missing=3   Cigarette design features   Mean   SD Tar 9.1 1.6 Missing=244 Nicotine 0.7 0.1 Missing=244 CO 9.1 1.5 Missing=244 Pressure drop open 85.4 16.0 Missing=244 Pressure drop closed 94.0 37.3 Missing=244 Ventilation 30.2 13.3 Missing=244 Product length 84.3 6.6 Missing=244 Diameter 7.7 0.3 Missing=244 Wet tobacco weight 841.2 78.0 Missing=244 Dry tobacco weight a 622.8 67.1 Missing/excluded=256 Filter length a 23.6 3.0 Missing/excluded=308 a Data beyond three standard deviations of the mean were excluded. * Valid percentage. We explored relationships among the cigarette design features. As anticipated, filter ventilation was strongly negatively related to tar (r= -0.42, p<0.001), while dry weight was positively associated with tar (r=0.29, p<0.001). Interrelationships among other measures are shown in Supplementary file Table S2. Supplementary file Tables S3A and S3B show mean values for cigarette design features by participant demographics and outcome variables, along with associated ANOVA tests. Pressure drop, ventilation, weight, and length showed consistent relationship to multiple person-level factors. Compared with older age groups, individuals aged 18–34 years reported utilizing cigarettes that on average had lower open pressure drop (82.97 mmWG, p=0.002), closed pressure drop (87.32 mmWG, p<0.001), ventilation (28.0%, p<0.001), overall length (83.07 mm, p<0.001), and wet tobacco weight (832.07 mg, p=0.001). Filter length (23.25 mm, p<0.001) and dry tobacco weight (614.57 mg, p=0.05) were lowest in cigarettes reported by those aged 35–44 years, and diameter (7.68 mm, p=0.02) was lowest in cigarettes reported by those aged ≥55 years. Cigarettes reported by male respondents tended on average to have lower closed pressure drop (87.6 mmWG vs 100.7 mmWG, p<0.001), ventilation (28.5% vs 31.9%, p<0.001), filter length (23.3 mm vs 23.9 mm, p=0.01) and overall length (83.7 mm vs 84.9 mm, p=0.01), as well as larger diameter (7.8 mm vs 7.7 mm, p=0.001). Individuals who report smoking ≤10 cigarettes per day, utilize cigarettes that, on average, have a lower diameter (7.71 mm, p=0.01), wet tobacco weight (833.12 mg, p=0.001), and dry tobacco weight (617.01 mg, p=0.01) when compared with those who smoke more, 11–20 and 21 cigarettes per day. Cigarettes reported by individuals with a low level of education tended to have lower open pressure drop (84.28 mmWG, p=0.03) compared to those reported by individuals with moderate or high level education. With respect to outcome measures, perceived own-brand harshness was significantly associated with closed pressure drop, ventilation, overall length, and filter length. Perceived harmfulness of own brand was associated with open pressure drop, diameter, wet weight, and dry weight. Perception that smooth/ultra cigarettes are less harmful was associated with wet weight. Intention to quit was not associated with any cigarette design features. Supplementary file Table S3C displays mean values for tar, nicotine, and CO (ppm), by participant demographics and outcome variables, along with associated ANOVA tests. Interestingly, cigarettes reported by those who perceive themselves as being in poor or fair health tended to emit more CO than cigarettes reported by individuals who perceive themselves as being in at least good health (9.24 vs 9.01, p=0.02).

DISCUSSION While previous studies have consistently demonstrated associations between filter ventilation and odds of perceiving one’s own brand as smoother 15 20 23 18 20 22 Consistent relationships between perceived health status and product beliefs are not well documented in the literature. We found health status to be significantly associated with three of our primary outcomes. Specifically, those who reported being of poor or fair health were more likely to perceive smooth/ultra and their own cigarettes as less harmful, as well as less likely to perceive their own brand as smoother. We also noted that those in poor or fair health smoked cigarettes with higher CO emissions on average. Still, it is difficult to extrapolate the direction of effect within these cross-sectional data. Additionally, we found male respondents to be more likely to perceive smooth/ultra and their own cigarettes as less harmful. Though few studies have demonstrated significant relationships between gender and product beliefs, results from a study evaluating risk perceptions of filter ventilation in a sample of US adults suggest that females are more likely to perceive their own brand as less harmful 23 23 16 There are several factors that might explain the observed differences between previous and current findings. First, cigarette marketing in France has been limited over the past two decades due to restrictions implemented through the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the European Union Tobacco Products Directive 4 6 6 Limitations A key limitation of this study is that the matching of self-reported brands/varieties with factory-made brand names could have been imperfect (Supplementary file Table S1). Furthermore, due to the European Union Tobacco Products Directive’s limits on tar, nicotine, and CO, there is less variation in the range of product designs on the market 6 CONCLUSIONS Despite the banning of many deceptive descriptors, cigarettes continue to be manufactured in ways that perpetuate misconceptions. This cross-sectional study underscores the importance of monitoring certain cigarette design features that can inculcate false perceptions of smoothness and safety. Additionally, the current findings suggest that misconceptions may be more prominent in certain populations, which can be important in shaping more targeted communication efforts.
