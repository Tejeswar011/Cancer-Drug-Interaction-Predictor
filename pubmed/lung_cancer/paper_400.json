Such inflammation can be triggered by environmental toxic substances that compromise the epithelial barrier, including food additives, personal hygiene and cleaning products, air pollution, and nano‐ and microplastics [ 1 2 3 4 5 S1 4 6 Caco‐2 cells and gut‐on‐a‐chips were used in our study to test the effects of these taste enhancers on gut epithelial barrier. Caco‐2 cells in gut‐on‐a‐chip form a tubular 3D structure with an intact epithelial barrier similar to physiological and pathological conditions that allows the assessment of barrier integrity [ 7 1A S1A–D 1B S2A 1B,C S2B–D S3 1D S4A–D S5 S6 1E 1F FIGURE 1 Effects of MSG, DSG, DSI, and their combination on intestinal epithelial cell viability, barrier integrity, and oxidative stress. (A) The MTT assay shows relative cell viability expressed as a percentage of the untreated control after 24 h of exposure to increasing concentrations of MSG, DSG, DSI, and their combined treatment. Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks (* p p p p RNA‐sequencing analysis demonstrated that 1% MSG and the combined treatment caused distinct shifts in molecular pathways (Figure 2A 2B 2C 2C 2D,E S2 S3 2F S4 2G Deptor 8 SMURF1 PINK1 ULK1 MAP1LC3B2 2G S5 9 FIGURE 2 Differential gene expression and pathway perturbations induced by MSG and the combined taste enhancer exposure. (A) Principal component analysis (PCA) of RNA‐seq data from Caco‐2 cells treated with 1% MSG, 1% DSG, 1% DSI and 1% combined treatment, or control reveals distinct clustering of treated groups n: 6, illustrating global changes in gene expression profiles induced by these additives. (B) The Venn diagram illustrates a set of genes that changed expression under 1% MSG and 1% combined treatment exposure, with 1424 genes being upregulated and 1651 genes downregulated. (C) Enrichment analysis identifies pathways prominently affected by MSG and the combined treatment. Notable among these are those governing responses to cell growth and differentiation, signaling pathways, stress responses, transport processes, mitochondrial processes and autophagy. (D–G) Heatmaps depict relative expression levels of representative genes involved in oxidative stress responses, unfolded protein responses, aerobic respiration, and macroautophagy comparing controls, cells exposed to 1% MSG, and those exposed to the combined treatment. Red and blue colors indicate upregulation and downregulation, respectively, while clustering patterns show that MSG and combined treatments disrupt proteostasis, enhance oxidative and ER stress responses, and compromise mitochondrial function. In conclusion, our findings suggest that under daily exposure conditions, MSG, DSG, DSI, and their combination disrupt the epithelial barrier integrity, induce various destructive biological processes, including oxidative stress, unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as altered key molecular pathways governing autophagy and proteostasis in intestinal epithelial cells. Additionally, our study shows that NAC mitigates the oxidative stress, which is induced by 1% MSG in intestinal epithelial cells. Future research will explore antioxidant strategies to reduce MSG‐induced cell damage. While caution is needed in extrapolating these results directly to human health, this work underscores the importance of further research on the molecular mechanisms by which common dietary food additives influence gut barrier function and cellular homeostasis.
