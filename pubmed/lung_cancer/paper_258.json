This study assessed toxic trace elements (TTEs) Cadmium (Cd), Manganese (Mn), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) in the blood of male and female tobacco users and non-users from urban and rural Karachi, along with associated health risks. A total of 190 blood and 120 tobacco samples (30 cigarettes, 90 STPs) were analyzed. Cd, Mn, and Pb were measured using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS), and Zn by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) after acid digestion. The study revealed significantly higher metal concentrations in urban users due to combined exposure from tobacco and environmental pollution. Cd levels in gutka (1.11 mg/kg) and cigarettes (1.035 mg/kg) exceeded WHO’s limit (0.5 mg/kg). Urban male smokers had the highest blood Pb (0.108 ± 0.01 mg/L), over tenfold above the WHO limit, while urban females showed the highest Mn (0.031 mg/L). Rural male mainpuri users had the highest Zn level (2.76 ± 0.16 mg/L). Cd in cigarette posed the highest cancer risk (CR: 9.14 × 10⁻⁴); gutka users had a CR of 6.74 × 10⁻⁴. Female gutka users had the highest Pb intake (0.513 mg/kg/day). The findings call for urgent biomonitoring, regulation, and public health interventions.

These elements originate from industrial emissions, soil, vehicle pollution, tobacco use, and environmental contamination 10 11 12 13, 14 15 16 17 18 Blood is the primary biological matrix for assessing the accumulation of potentially TTEs in the human body. However, due to the invasive nature, pain, and logistical challenges of blood collection including issues with transport, storage, and ethical considerations alternative biomarkers are being explored 19 20 21 22 23 24 Materials and methods Reagents and chemicals Nitric acid (HNO 3 2 2 Instrumentation A Hitachi Model Z-8000 electro-thermal/flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (ET-AAS/FAAS) was used to determine the levels of Cd, Pb, Mn and Zn in cigarette and STPs (gutka, mainpuri, and naswar) samples, whole blood samples from male and female smokers and users of STPs including non-users/control blood samples. The concentrations of Cd, Mn, and Pb were determined using ET-AAS, while -FAAS was employed for Zn determination 25 Cigarette and STPs samples collection, preservation, and handling About 10 brands of Cigarette and STPs (Gutka, Mainpuri and Naswar) in triplicate were purchased from local retail shops in Karachi in triplicate. There were 120 number of total samples. These samples were marked and packed in polythene bags. The samples were kept in freezer in the laboratory until starting sample preparation. Blood sample collection, preservation, and handling A total of 190 venous blood samples were collected from urban and rural areas of Karachi between 2023 and 2024, following strict safety protocols. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Committee of PCSIR (Approval No. PCSIR/IRC/2023/027), and informed consent was obtained from all participants to ensure confidentiality and ethical compliance. Participants were divided into two groups like Group 1 (140 individuals): Male and female users of cigarettes (10–20 g/day) and STPs (Gutka, Mainpuri, Naswar; ~10 g/day), aged around 60 years, with no other drug use. Group 2 (50 individuals): Healthy, age-matched controls with no history of tobacco or drug use, matched for socioeconomic status, locality, and diet. Blood (3–5 ml) was collected using metal-free Safety Vacutainer tubes, stored in CP bottles, and preserved at 5 °C. All samples were handled with attention to temperature control and contamination prevention 26 The conventional wet acid digestion method (CDM) Triplicate samples of 1.0 mL blood and 0.5–1.0 g of tobacco products (cigarette, gutka, mainpuri, naswar), along with six replicates of Standard Reference Material (SRM 1575 a, Pine Needles), were placed in 100 mL conical flasks. Each sample was digested using 20–50 mL of concentrated nitric acid (65%) and 2.0–5.0 mL of hydrogen peroxide (30%), then heated at 250 °C for 20–60 min until a clear solution formed. After cooling and dilution with distilled water, the solutions were filtered (Whatman 42 filter paper) and transferred to 10 mL volumetric flasks for analysis. Metal concentrations were determined using ETAAS/FAAS spectrometry. Blanks and spiking recovery tests were processed similarly to validate accuracy. All procedures followed strict ethical guidelines approved by the PCSIR Institutional Review Committee, ensuring safe handling, storage, and transport of blood samples in line with biohazard protocols 27 Statistical analysis (All experimental data were processed using Minitab 13.2 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA), Minitab, and Origin Pro (9.0) and Microsoft Excel (2013). The results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA and t-tests at a 0.05 significance level to evaluate variations in TTE concentrations among different cigarette brands, STPs, and blood samples and control healthy subjects (nonsmokers) residing in urban and rural areas of Karachi. Average daily intake (ADI) The Average Daily Intake (ADI) of potentially TTEs was calculated for all analyzed samples, including cigarettes and STPs like gutka, mainpuri, and naswar. The ADI was determined using the following equation: Where: 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:\\text{A}\\text{D}\\text{I}=\\:\\frac{\\text{C}\\text{M}\\left(\\frac{\\text{m}\\text{g}}{\\text{K}\\text{g}}\\right)\\text{x}\\:\\text{A}\\text{C}\\:\\left(\\text{g}\\right)\\:}{\\text{B}\\text{W}\\:\\left(\\text{K}\\text{g}\\right)}$$\\end{document} Where ADI is Average daily intake (10 to 20 g cigarttes/10 g STPs per day, CM is representing concentration of metal in mg/kg, Average consumption (AC) of intake of cigarette per day approximately for male smoker 20 g cigarette/day by body weight of 70 Kg and for female 10 g cigarettes per day by body weight of 60 Kg respectively, (g/person/d). Similarly for STPs taken 10 g for each products and body weight is smilar as described in cigerttes. Tolerable daily intakes (TDI) of metals 28 29 Chronic daily intake (CDI) The CDI of potentially TTEs was calculated for all analyzed samples, including cigarette and STPs and whole blood of male and female of both areas. The approximate age of tobacco products users is 60 years and the the addiction assumed is 15 years, so the exposure duration would be 45 years.

Additionally, 120 samples of various tobacco products (cigarette, gutka, mainpuri, naswar) were collected from the Karachi market. All samples were analyzed for potentially TTEs using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide digestion, followed by FAAS and ETAAS. The study focused on users around 60 years old and highlighted high tobacco use among adolescents, especially in low-income groups, due to easy access and low cost. Findings were compared with healthy individuals from urban and rural Karachi. Concentration of TTEs in cigarette and STPs The results of TTEs in cigarettes and STPs reveals significant variations. Cadmium (Cd) levels were highest in gutka (1.11 ± 0.21 mg/kg), followed by cigarettes (1.035 ± 0.08 mg/kg), both exceeding the WHO permissible limit of 0.5 mg/kg. Manganese (Mn) showed the highest concentration in cigarettes (49.19 ± 4.11 mg/kg) and mainpuri (39.8 ± 3.26 mg/kg), with comparatively lower levels in gutka (13.8 ± 1.25 mg/kg) and naswar (1.87 ± 0.03 mg/kg). Pb levels were notably elevated in gutka (3.08 ± 0.25 mg/kg) and naswar (2.18 ± 0.17 mg/kg), far exceeding the WHO limit of 0.2 mg/kg. Zinc, while essential in trace amounts, was found in high concentrations in cigarettes (58.7 ± 5.12 mg/kg), well above the WHO permissible limit of 5 mg/kg 37 1  Table 1 Average values of Cd, Mn, Pb, and Zn level in Cigarette, Gutka, Mainpuri, and Naswar samples and whole blood samples of Smoker and Non-Smoker, STP user in urban and rural areas.

Metals in blood of cigartee and STPs user Tobacco use is a growing health concern due to toxic elements like Cd, Mn, Pb, and Zn, which pose carcinogenic and neurotoxic risks 38 Cadmium (Cd) Cadmium (Cd) exposure is significantly linked to tobacco use, as evidenced by markedly higher blood Cd levels in smokers compared to non-smokers. Urban male smokers (0.055 ± 0.003 mg/L) show nearly tenfold higher Cd concentrations than non-smokers (0.0058 ± 0.16 mg/L), clearly indicating that smoking is a major source of Cd exposure ( p 1 2 3 4 1 39 40  Fig. 1 Trace toxic metals in blood of cigarette smokers from urban and rural areas.  Fig. 2 Trace toxic metals in blood of gutka users from urban and rural areas.  Fig. 3 Trace toxic metals in blood of Mainpuri users from urban and rural areas.  Fig. 4 Trace toxic metals in blood of Naswar users from urban and rural areas. Manganese (Mn) Although Mn is essential for enzyme function and antioxidant defense, its excessive accumulation, especially via inhalation, poses serious neurotoxic risks, including links to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases 41 p 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 Across STP users, urban mainpuri and naswar users also showed higher Mn concentrations compared to rural users, particularly among males ( p 42 Lead (Pb) Lead (Pb) exposure remains a critical health issue. The WHO safe limit for blood Pb is 0.01 mg/L (10 µg/dL). In this study, urban male smokers (MS-UA) had the highest Pb concentration at 0.108 ± 0.01 mg/L, exceeding the WHO limit over tenfold. Urban female smokers (FS-UA) had 0.085 ± 0.006 mg/L, also well above safe levels. In rural smokers, Pb levels were lower: MS-RA averaged 0.059 ± 0.004 mg/L, and FS-RA had 0.051 ± 0.003 mg/L, with no significant gender difference ( p p 1 2 3 4 Zinc (Zn) Zinc (Zn), an essential trace element, plays a critical role in enzymatic activity, immune function, and cellular repair. In this study, Zn concentrations in tobacco users varied by product type, gender, and location, though most remained within or slightly above normal physiological limits. Among cigarette smokers, Zn levels were moderately higher than in non-smokers. Urban male smokers (0.631 ± 0.05 mg/L) and rural females (0.636 ± 0.04 mg/L) showed the highest values, while non-smokers exhibited lower levels (e.g., FNS-UA: 0.516 ± 0.05 mg/L). Though these differences were not statistically significant ( p 43 Smokeless tobacco product (STPs) users, especially gutka and naswar users, had consistently higher Zn levels. Gutka-using urban males recorded 1.42 ± 0.12 mg/L, while naswar-using urban males had 1.38 ± 0.13 mg/L. Females generally showed lower Zn concentrations than males. A striking anomaly was observed among rural male mainpuri users, who had a significantly elevated Zn level of 2.76 ± 0.16 mg/L ( p 44 45 Analytical figures of merit The proposed method for analyzing trace metals (Cd, Pb, Mn, and Zn) was rigorously validated through repeatability, linearity, and recovery tests. Calibration curves demonstrated excellent linearity with correlation coefficients of 0.9995 for Cd, 0.9996 for Mn, 0.9997 for Pb, and 0.9999 for Zn over the ranges of 1–5 µg/L for Cd and Mn, 10–50 µg/L for Pb, and 0.5–1.5 mg/L for Zn. The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.003 mg/L for Cd, 0.025 mg/L for Pb, 0.01 mg/L for Mn and Zn, while limits of quantification (LOQ) were calculated as 10 times the standard deviation of blanks. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) for triplicate analyses were all under 10%, confirming good precision. Accuracy of the method The proposed methodology was validated using Standard Reference Material (SRM 1575a: Pine Needles, Pinus taeda 2 p  Table 2 Standard reference material ( Analyte Assigned values Determined Values % Recovery Added Value Found values % Recovery Standard Reference Material Spiking recovery test in cigarette sample, Cd 0.233 ± 0.004 0.229 ± 0.018 98.3 0.0 1.15 ± 0.11 …… 1.0 2.11 ± 0.21 98.1 Mn 488 ± 12 475 ± 39.2 97.3 0.0 56.3 ± 4.67 …… 20.0 76.1 ± 5.15 99.7 Pb 0.167 ± 0.015 0.165 ± 0.01 98.8 0.0 0.182 ± 0.02 …… 1.0 1.15 ± 0.09 97.3 Zn 38 ± 2 37.8 ± 3.65 99.5 0.0 53.8 ± 4.12 …… 15.0 68.5 ± 4.97 99.6 Application to real samples A validated analytical method was applied to blood samples from smokers, STPs users, and non-smokers in both urban and rural areas of Karachi to determine levels of Cd, Mn, Pb, and Zn. Blood samples were collected in CP bottles from healthy individuals who were not drug users. Samples were digested using 65% nitric acid on a sand bath at 250 °C, filtered, and analyzed. Results (presented in Table 1 Average daily intake and health risk Estimation The Average Daily Intake (ADI) of potentially TTEs (Cd, Mn, Pb, Zn) from cigarettes and STPs; gutka, mainpuri, and naswar, revealed significant variations in exposure levels and associated health risks. Cigarettes posed the highest Cd exposure (0.233 mg/kg/day, ADI), mainly due to inhalation, which offers greater metal bioavailability. Smokers also showed higher average ADIs for Mn (11.1 mg/kg/day), Pb (0.197 mg/kg/day), and Zn (13.3 mg/kg/day), indicating elevated risks for neurotoxicity, cardiovascular issues, and cancer (Table 3 3 3 46  Table 3 Estimated Average Daily Intake (ADI), Chronic Daily Intake (CDI), Target Hazard Quotient (THQ), Carcinogenic Risk (CR) and Hazard Index (HI) results are expressed inmg/kg/day.

In addition to measuring concentrations, the study estimated the ADI, CDI, THQ, and CR for cigarette smokers (CS) and users of STPs such as gutka, mainpuri, and naswar. ADI values were compared against WHO/FAO-TDI limits, based on an average consumption of 10–20 g of cigarette tobacco per day 47 For Cd, the CDI was 2.33 × 10⁻⁴ mg/kg/day and the THQ was 0.233, indicating low non-carcinogenic risk. However, the CR was 1.42x10-3, suggesting a potential carcinogenic threat, which is above the U.S. EPA’s acceptable range (10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁴). Over a 70-year lifetime exposure, the CR increased to 9.14 × 10⁻⁴, still within acceptable limits but raising concerns due to Cd’s classification as a known human carcinogen (Table 3 3 48 For Pb, the ADI was 0.197 mg/kg/day, and the CDI was 1.97 × 10⁻⁴ mg/kg/day, with a THQ of 5.63 × 10⁻². The CR for Pb was 1.07 × 10⁻⁶in the carcinogenic risk category, reflecting a very low yet present cancer risk, consistent with its status as a probable human carcinogen 49 3 50 3 51 54 Risk assessment in cigarette, gutka, Mainpuri and Naswar This study employed CDI, THQ, and CR to evaluate non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks from adult exposure to TTEs, Cd, Mn, Pb, and Zn, through the use of cigarettes, gutka, mainpuri, and naswar. In gutka, Cd posed the most notable carcinogenic risk, with a CR value of 6.74 × 10⁻⁴. Non-carcinogenic metrics for Cd included a THQ of 0.172 and a CDI of 1.72 × 10⁻⁴ mg/kg/day. In gutka, Pb had lower risk levels, with a CR of 2.61 × 10⁻⁶ and a THQ of 0.088. For Mn and Zn, both considered essential elements, no CR was calculated. Their THQs remained well below 1, indicating no significant non-cancer risk (Table 3 3 Comparison of TTEs with reported study Comparison in tobacco products Cadmium (Cd) levels in Karachi cigarette samples in the present study (1.035 ± 0.081 mg/kg) exceeded previously reported values of 0.53 mg/kg in Pakistan 56 55 55 55 51 55 56 57 4  Table 4 Comparison of metal concentration with other reported study for cigarette, gutka, Naswar and Mainpuri products (mg/kg) and in blood (mg/L) levels of users. , Sample Cd Mn Pb Zn Country Name References Cigarette 0.39 55.4 2.08 65.0 Different regions of Pakistan  55 0.53* --- 11.56* --- Different regions of Pakistan  56 0.80 --- 3.05 --- Selangor state, Malaysia  57 0.12 --- 2.98 13.39 Samaru Area of Zaria, Nigeria  51 Gutka BDL(< 0.01) 40.27 1.52 27.42 Karachi, Pakistan  58 Gutka 0.82 --- 3.77 --- Sindh, Pakistan  59 Mainpuri 1.65 --- 8.66 --- Naswar (Snuff) --- 0.1674 0.190 0.1674 KPK.

Urban smokers showed significantly higher metal levels due to combined exposure from tobacco, industrial emissions, and unregulated smokeless products like gutka, mainpuri, and naswar. Cigarettes and gutka had the highest Cd concentrations 1.035 mg/kg and 1.11 mg/kg, respectively both exceeding the WHO limit of 0.5 mg/kg. Urban male smokers had the highest blood Pb level (0.108 ± 0.01 mg/L), over ten times the WHO threshold, while urban females had the highest Mn level (0.031 mg/L). Rural male mainpuri users had the highest Zn level (2.76 ± 0.16 mg/L), indicating potential contamination. Risk assessments identified cadmium as the most hazardous, with a lifetime cancer risk of 9.13 × 10⁻⁴. Gutka users had the highest product-specific cancer risk (CR: 6.74 × 10⁻⁴), and females the highest Pb intake (0.513 mg/kg/day). Despite non-carcinogenic risks remaining below critical levels, cumulative exposure necessitates regular monitoring, stricter regulation, and improved agricultural and manufacturing standards, especially in low-regulation settings.
