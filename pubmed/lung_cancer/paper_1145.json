Geo-electrochemical technology has been shown to have significant potential for remediating heavy metal-contaminated soils in recent years. Taking contaminated paddy soil from northern Guangxi as the research subject, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of geo-electrochemical technology for arsenic remediation. An orthogonal experimental design was used to identify the optimal combination of parameters, including power supply duration, voltage gradient, power supply mode, and electrolyte type. The arsenic removal efficiency was thoroughly assessed, and the underlying remediation mechanisms associated with geo-electrochemical technology combined with EDTA-2Na were extensively investigated. The findings revealed a substantial decrease in the residual arsenic fraction after treatment, accompanied by a substantial increase in the mobility and bioavailability of arsenic. The maximum removal rate of arsenic from the soil was determined to be 19.59%. Among the analyzed factors, electrolyte type exerted the most significant influence on the arsenic removal efficiency, followed by power supply duration and voltage gradient, while the impact of the power supply mode was less significant. The optimal remediation effect was achieved under the following conditions: a power supply duration of 108 h, a voltage gradient of 0.6 V/cm, continuous power supply mode, and the use of EDTA-2Na as the electrolyte.

Introduction Soil is considered a vital part of the natural environment and a fundamental resource for the production of food, playing an essential role in sustaining the survival of human life and ecosystems [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 10 Growing concerns over soil arsenic contamination have driven researchers to explore various remediation approaches, including soil replacement, solidification, chemical leaching, and phytoremediation [ 11 12 13 14 15 Geo-electrochemical technology allows for deep-penetrating geochemical explorations, employing physical principles to assess the geochemical composition of the Earth. The principle of this approach involves applying an external electric field to the surface soil, prompting the migration of charged substances associated with deep ore bodies within the near-surface loose layer and their accumulation on the element collector surrounding the electrode. Through analysis of the ore-forming elements accumulated on the element collector and identifying anomalies, blind ore deposits can be effectively detected [ 16 17 18 19 In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in applying geo-electrochemical technology for the remediation of soil heavy metal contamination. Sun et al. [ 20 This study addresses the urgent ecological and environmental challenge of remediating and restoring farmland soils contaminated with heavy metals. Taking arsenic-contaminated farmland soils in the northern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region as the research subject, this study conducted orthogonal experiments using a geo-electrochemical system to systematically examine the effects of the power supply duration, voltage gradient, power supply mode, and electrolyte type. These investigations allowed for evaluation of the dynamic changes in soil pH and electrical current throughout the remediation process, the trends of arsenic speciation, and the overall effectiveness of the approach. The study clarified the mechanisms underlying the integrated use of geo-electrochemical technology and EDTA-2Na for remediating arsenic-contaminated soils, emphasizing the pathways of arsenic mobilization, migration, and transformation throughout the remediation process. This investigation provides valuable technical insights and scientific evidence to support the practical application of geo-electrochemical methods for remediation of As-contaminated farmland. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Soil Source The soil samples were collected from the experimental farmland of the Agricultural Science Institute located in the northern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. The specific sampling location is illustrated in Figure 1 The experimental farmland site comprised continuous, evenly distributed rice paddies, where consistent soil fertility and arsenic contamination levels were ensured by applying uniform agricultural management practices throughout the area. The soil type is paddy soil; in particular, hydromorphic paddy soil derived from brown calcareous soil parent material. Field sampling was conducted during the fallow period of rice cultivation, with a sampling depth of 0–20 cm. The soil samples were divided into two portions: one was directly placed into the experimental device for the remediation experiment, while the other was stored in a pollution-free room to air-dry naturally. After air-drying, the soil samples were crushed with a wooden stick to remove plant debris and large particle impurities. The soil samples were then ground using an agate mortar and sieved through 10-, 20-, 100-, and 200-mesh sieves sequentially. The sieved samples were sealed and stored in a cool and dry place until subsequent determinations of pH, moisture content, and electrical conductivity, as well as arsenic content and speciation. 2.2. Experimental Setup In this study, a low-voltage dipole geo-electrochemical extraction system, developed by the Institute for Prognosis of Concealed Ore Deposits at Guilin University of Technology [ 21 Figure 2 20 A specially designed experimental setup was constructed to meet the specific needs of the remediation study, as illustrated in Figure 3 2.3. Multi-Factor Combinatorial Optimization The remediation efficiency of geo-electrochemical technology is influenced by various interacting factors. Conducting a full factorial experiment would require extended durations, which may increase the risk of systematic errors due to time-dependent experimental drift. Therefore, the current remediation study was designed using an orthogonal experimental methodology to achieve time-efficient and cost-effective optimization. The use of an orthogonal experimental design enables the selection of representative test schemes from numerous combinations and identification of the optimal solution through outcome analysis. Moreover, it allows for the extraction of detailed information on individual factors through further data processing, thus providing more comprehensive experimental findings [ 22 Based on a thorough review of previous electrokinetic remediation research, four major influencing factors were identified for this study, each of which was configured with three operational levels (as detailed in Table 1 4 Table 2 The energy consumption was calculated in this study using Equation (1): (1) E c = 1 m c ∫ U I dt c c 2.4. Analytical Methods The soil moisture content was determined following the procedure described in Soil and Agricultural Chemistry Analysis [ 23 24 The sample testing process was subject to rigorous quality control measures, including the implementation of three sets of parallel samples for each group during sample analysis, ensuring a relative standard deviation of <10%. The limits of detection and reporting rates for total heavy metals and each form of determination were in accordance with the quality requirements for sample analysis. 2.5. Data Processing This study employed IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 for data analysis, while Origin 2020 and CorelDraw 2020 were used to generate graphical representations. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Physical, Chemical, and Contaminant Characteristics of Soil The basic physicochemical properties and arsenic content of the tested soil are presented in Table 3 3 25 3.2. Changes in pH Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 As shown in Figure 4 26 + − + − As shown in Figure 4 + − Figure 4 27 − + + − The voltage gradient and power supply mode critically influenced electrolyte pH dynamics. Higher voltage gradients intensified electrolytic reactions, resulting in increased generation of H + − + − 28 Post-treatment, the soils predominantly remained alkaline. In such conditions, OH − 29 3.3. Current Variation The system current during geo-electrochemical remediation is intrinsically associated with the abundance of mobile ions within soil pores. The concentration of mobile ions directly influences the soil’s electrical conductivity, which in turn governs the magnitude of the electric current. The evolution of conductivity is driven by a dynamic balance between the generation and migration of mobile ions and their transformation into immobile forms, modulating current trends throughout the process [ 30 31 Figure 5 + + 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ − 32 The intermittent supply (EK3, EK5, EK7) and electrode-reversal groups (EK2, EK4, EK9) displayed characteristic current spikes upon power resumption, indicating transient ion mobilization as the electric field temporarily overcame soil resistance. The later decrease in current was primarily due to the gradual reduction in available mobile ions, with their continuous migration exceeding their regeneration within the system [ 33 The voltage gradient critically regulated the current magnitude. In the citric acid groups, the current followed the order EK3 (0.9 V/cm) > EK8 (0.6 V/cm) > EK4 (0.3 V/cm)—a trend consistent with those observed in the EDTA-2Na and double deionized water groups. Higher gradients enhanced water electrolysis, producing more charge carriers and increasing the current. Under fixed voltage gradients, the current intensities consistently followed the order EDTA-2Na > citric acid > double deionized water across all power modes; this was primarily attributed to EDTA-2Na’s stronger chelating ability, allowing it to more effectively release soil-bound ions than citric acid [ 34 3.4. Analysis of Arsenic Speciation in Post-Remediation Soil Previous studies have indicated that arsenic in agricultural soils primarily exists in five speciation forms: Water-soluble fraction (T1), mild acid-soluble fraction (T2), reducible fraction (T3), oxidizable fraction (T4), and residual fraction (T5) [ 35 36 Figure 6 37 4 2 38 4 2 3+ 4 3− Ksp −20 39 40 In summary, geo-electrochemical technology enhances the mobilization of heavy metal species in soil by transforming insoluble fractions into water-soluble and more mobile forms, facilitating their effective removal. The micro-electric field drives the migration of contaminants from deeper soil layers to the surface, concentrating them near the electrodes to be captured by adsorption units. For effective practical application, periodic replacement of the electrolyte solution should be performed to remove dissolved metals, along with targeted excavation of soil around the electrodes to minimize secondary contamination risks due to the enrichment of surface metals. Furthermore, regular replacement of adsorption materials is essential to maintain the system’s effectiveness and ensure continuous arsenic removal from the soil. 3.5. Analysis of Arsenic Removal Results The results regarding the arsenic content, the orthogonal range analysis, and ANOVA for geo-electrochemical remediation of arsenic-contaminated soil are summarized in Figure 7 Table 4 Table 5 Figure 7 Table 4 R R R p SS SS SS Higher voltage gradients generate stronger electric fields, which intensify reactions within the remediation system and accelerate pH fluctuations. The generation of H + 41 42 43 4 3− 3+ EDTA-2Na exhibits a strong chelating ability with Fe 3+ 3+ The specific remediation energy consumption for each experimental group is presented in Table 6 Table 6 3.6. Mechanistic Analysis of Geo-Electrochemical Technology Coupled with EDTA-2Na for Remediation of Arsenic-Contaminated Soil In 1897, Helmholtz discovered that solid–liquid interfaces form electrical double layers [ 44 45 46 Figure 8 (2) M e n + + n ( H 2 O ) − ⇌ Hydration Me ⋅ n H 2 O When external electric fields are applied, the soil electrochemistry is altered, disrupting inherent chemical barriers and releasing As-bearing charged colloids such as clay minerals and organic matter. These colloids then migrate continuously toward the electrode chambers through electromigration [ 47 Therefore, arsenic remediation via geo-electrochemical treatment combined with EDTA-2Na involves two synergistic processes: (i) Electrokinetic desorption and transport—the release of arsenic from soil matrices followed by mobilization driven by electromigration and electro-osmosis [ 9 42 (ii) EDTA-2Na-assisted detachment and chelation—the displacement of arsenic species from soil surfaces through ligand exchange, followed by the formation of mobile As–EDTA complexes [ 48 The mechanistic framework is illustrated in Figure 9 In the soil environment, arsenic primarily exists as As(III) and As(V), mainly in the form of negatively charged arsenate oxyanions (e.g., HAsO 4 2− 2 4 − 49 50 51 3+ 3+ 52 The chelating action of EDTA-2Na converts arsenic into more mobile forms, while EDTA-2Na present in soil pores functions as a natural transport medium. The electromigration and electro-osmotic flow promoted by the geo-electrochemical system provide the driving force for the migration of mobile arsenic, synergistically improving the removal efficiency. Residual arsenic was found to be the predominant form in the soil, such that standalone geo-electrochemical remediation removed only a limited portion. Similarly, treatment with EDTA-2Na alone primarily facilitated the desorption or chelation of arsenic into the pore water without achieving effective extraction [ 53 3+ 3+ 54 55 In summary, the remediation effect of geo-electrochemical technology combined with EDTA-2Na in arsenic-contaminated soil is due to a multiphase electrochemical reaction mechanism, integrating the “effective collision-type” reactions driven by the micro-electric fields generated by the galvanic and electrolytic cells in the geo-electrochemical system with the “activated transition-type” chelation reactions of EDTA-2Na. 4. Conclusions (1) Following geo-electrochemical remediation, the residual fraction of arsenic in the soil is transformed into more mobile forms, resulting in an increased proportion of mobile arsenic species. (2) Group EK7 achieved the highest arsenic removal rate of approximately 19.59%. The results of the orthogonal experiment revealed that the type of electrolyte had the most significant impact on the arsenic removal efficiency, followed by the power supply duration and the voltage gradient, while the power supply mode had a minimal effect. The optimal conditions for removal of arsenic from soil were identified as a power supply duration of 108 h, a voltage gradient of 0.6 V/cm, continuous power supply mode, and EDTA-2Na as the electrolyte. (3) The remediation effect of geo-electrochemical treatment combined with EDTA-2Na in arsenic-contaminated soil is due to a multiphase electrochemical reaction mechanism, integrating the “effective collision-type” reactions driven by micro-electric field effects derived from the electrokinetic process (involving galvanic and electrolytic cells) with the “activation transition-type” chelation reactions facilitated by EDTA-2Na.
