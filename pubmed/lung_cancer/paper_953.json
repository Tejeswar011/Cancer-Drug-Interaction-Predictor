Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major global health concern and is the third leading cause of cancer‐related mortality worldwide, with its incidence and death rates steadily rising [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 In HCC, the different subtypes of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been found to correlate with patient responses to immunotherapy and are essential to tumor progression and treatment effectiveness [ 13 15 16 17 Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), also known as osteopontin (OPN), is a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including inflammatory responses, immune regulation, and tissue remodeling [ 18 19 20 21 + 22 Machine learning and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools to address complex medical problems by leveraging large‐scale clinical datasets. These methodologies have consistently demonstrated remarkable performance in predictive modeling and clustering tasks. By employing these advanced analytical techniques, we can explore mechanisms of therapeutic resistance across multiple omic levels—transcriptomics, epigenomics, and translatomics—uncovering insights that may enhance treatment efficacy [ 23 25 + Accordingly, the aim of this study is to identify signature genes associated with SPP1 + + 2. Methods 2.1. Acquisition and Integration of Transcriptomic Data RNA expression profiles, gene mutation data, and associated clinical information for HCC were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database ( n 2.2.

Survival Analysis and Model Validation Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analysis was conducted to compare overall survival (OS) between high‐ and low‐risk groups, with statistical significance determined using the log‐rank test. The predictive accuracy of the prognostic model was assessed using time‐dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the curve (AUC) values for 1‐, 3‐, and 5‐year survival predictions were calculated to evaluate model robustness and predictive capacity. 2.6. Data Analysis Software All statistical analyses and data visualizations were performed using R software (Version 4.1.0) along with relevant bioinformatics packages, including “ggplot2,” “survival,” and “clusterProfiler.” A p 3. Results 3.1. Cell Type Characterization and Marker Gene Identification We obtained a publicly available scRNA‐seq dataset from the GEO database and analyzed cellular populations derived from multiple HCC patients (e.g., HCC01T and HCC02T). The proportions of various cell types within each patient group—including hepatocytes, macrophages, T cells, and endothelial cells—are illustrated in Figure 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e + + Figure 1 Cell type distribution, clustering, and correlation analysis across different patient groups.

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis further indicated these genes were enriched in cellular membrane organization, cell–matrix adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton dynamics, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. These results provide biologically relevant insights linking specific genes to HCC prognosis and survival outcomes (Figure 3e,f 3.4. Model Construction and Validation We evaluated 429 algorithmic combinations across the ICGC and TCGA cohorts and calculated the C‐index for each in the validation dataset. The StepCox (backward) combined with RSF approach achieved the highest average C‐index of 0.828 and was therefore selected as the final SPP1 + 4a p 4c,d Figure 4 Construction and validation of the signature.

Discussion HCC is characterized by multifactorial etiology and complex molecular mechanisms, with treatment strategies largely dependent on clinical staging [ 28 2 29 30 In this study, we leveraged transcriptomic data from scRNA‐seq and conducted in‐depth bioinformatic analyses to elucidate the role of SPP1 + + + 31 36 Given the poor prognosis of advanced HCC, we investigated the determinants of patient survival and identified the prognostic utility of SPP1 + 37 + + Despite the valuable insights gained from scRNA‐seq analysis, the immune microenvironment varies substantially among patients.
