Despite its known involvement in the progression of specific cancers, a comprehensive pan-cancer examination of the prognostic value and biological implications of CA9 has not been performed. This study systematically explored the diverse roles of CA9 across multiple cancer types. Methods: Bioinformatics methods were applied via extensive datasets from TCGA, GTEx, CPTAC, CancerSEA, and the public literature. We systematically analyzed the associations between CA9 expression profiles and various clinical parameters, prognosis, immune infiltration, immune-related genes, TMB, MSI, and tumor stemness scores. Additionally, a single-cell functional analysis was conducted. Results: CA9 was significantly upregulated in 29 out of 33 cancer types, indicating high discriminatory ability between tumor and normal tissues. Elevated CA9 expression correlated with poor OS and PFIs in multiple cancers, such as GBMLGG, CESC, LUAD, KIPAN, GBM, THYM, LIHC, THCA, PAAD, and KICH. In 39 cancers, CA9 expression was predominantly negatively correlated with the infiltration of 22 immune cell infiltrations. It was also associated with TMB in 12 tumors and with MSI in 9. Single-cell analysis revealed positive links between CA9 and essential processes such as hypoxia, metastasis, angiogenesis, and stemness. Conclusion: This study provides compelling evidence that CA9 is a potential pan-cancer prognostic marker and diagnostic tool. The associations of CA9 with immune components and determinants of immunotherapy response indicate the importance of CA9 in advancing cancer research and personalized treatment strategies.

The TME, a complex milieu encompassing various cellular and non-cellular components, plays a pivotal role in influencing tumor progression and therapeutic responses. One critical aspect of the tumor microenvironment is its acidity, which often arises from metabolic alterations. As a driver of cancer, this acidic microenvironment not only promotes tumor cell survival and invasiveness but also poses significant obstacles to conventional therapeutic interventions.  1 Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a large family of zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. They catalyze CO 2 3 − 2 + 3 - 2 2 3 4 6  7 8 9 10 12 13 14  15 16 17  18  19 In addition to directly regulating pH in hypoxic and acidic environments, CA9 also participates in cancer growth by providing nutrients and interacting with amino acid transfer proteins. The transport of glutamine into cells is fundamental and is mediated by several amino acid transporters (AATs), such as alanine serine cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT 2), sodium coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT 2), and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT 1), all of which may be affected by the pH gradient produced by CA9.  20  21 22 23 24 25 26 28 29 31 32 34 However, the majority of prior investigations have focused primarily on elucidating the role of CA9 within a single specific cancer. Comprehensive pan-cancer analyses examining the prognostic relevance and biological implications of CA9 are scarce in the literature. In our research, we conducted a systematic exploration of the correlations between CA9 expression and immune infiltration levels, DNA methylation patterns, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) across diverse cancer types. Additionally, we investigated the associations between CA9 and immune-related genes, as well as their influence on the TME. Our findings indicate that CA9 can serve as a prognostic indicator across various tumors, exerting a pivotal role in tumor immunity by influencing the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, MSI, and TMB. This research contributes valuable insights into the functional role of CA9 in the context of tumor immunotherapy. Methods Data Acquisition and Processing We retrieved comprehensive datasets for our study from the UCSC ( https://xenabrowser.net/ Table S1 https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/  35 Prognostic Analyses We employed the “coxph” function from the R package “survival” (version 3.5)  34  36 Immunological Infiltration Assessment For the assessment of immunological infiltration, we utilized the “deconvo_CIBERSOR” method from the R package “IOBR” (version 0.99),  37 Additionally, we employed the R package “ConsensusTME” (version 0.0.1.900)  38  39 Gene Mutation Analysis of CA9 cBioPortal ( https://www.cbioportal.org/  40 Single-Cell Function Analysis CancerSEA ( http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/CancerSEA/  41 Immunofluorescence (IF) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) To ascertain the cellular localization of CA9 and discern disparities in protein expression levels, IF and IHC images were acquired from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database ( http://www.proteinatlas.org/ Additionally, 16 immunohistochemistry sections of 5 different tumor tissues (cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer) were obtained from the Department of Pathology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. In-house immunohistochemical staining for CA9 was systematically performed on these sections. CA9 polyclonal antibody (cat no: 1107-1-AP) was purchased from proreintech.co (Wuhan China). This experiment was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (No. 2025KL-34). Image-pro plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) was used to measure the mean density (Integrated Optiondensity (IOD) /area) of CA9. Statistical Analysis The Wilcoxon rank sum test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare gene expression differences. Spearman or Pearson correlation analysis was used to calculate the correlation between 2 groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were used to compare the survival characteristics of the 2 groups of patients. The above statistical analysis and visualization were performed via R software (version 4.3.1) and GraphPad Prism 8. Results Expression of CA9 Between Tumor and Normal Tissues In TCGA pan-cancer database, we detected significant CA9 expression upregulation in 16 tumor tissues compared with normal tissues—GBM, CESC, LUAD, COAD, COADREAD, BRCA, KIRP, KIPAN, UCEC, HNSC, KIRC, LUSC, READ, PAAD, BLCA, and CHOL—and was accompanied by downregulation in 4 tumor tissues—PRAD, LIHC, THCA, and KICH ( Figure 1A Figure 1B Figure 1C-L Figure 1.

The Prognostic Value of CA9 We constructed Cox proportional hazard models to investigate the associations between CA9 expression levels and patient prognosis, including OS, PFI, DSS, and DFI, across diverse tumor types. Elevated CA9 expression was associated with unfavorable OS in GBMLGG, CESC, LUAD, KIPAN, GBM, THYM, LIHC, THCA, PAAD, and KICH but was associated with favorable outcomes in DLBC. Moreover, high CA9 expression was associated with a poor PFI in GBMLGG, BRCA, CESC, KIRP, KIPAN, THYM, LIHC, and CHOL ( Figure 2A B Figure 2. The univariate regression for OS: (A), PFI (B), DSS (C), and DFI (D) in pan-cancer. For DSS, GBMLGG, BRCA, CESC, LUAD, KIPAN, GBM, THYM, LIHC, THCA, and PAAD patients had poor prognoses ( Figure 2C Figure 2D CA9 is Differentially Expressed in Different Tumor Stages We assessed the association between CA9 expression and tumor stage and observed significant differences in 11 tumors such as COAD, COADREAD, BRCA, KIRP, KIPAN, THYM, LIHC, PAAD, BLCA, ACC, and CHOL. The observed trend indicated a notable increase in CA9 expression levels with advancing tumor stages, as depicted in Figure 3A Figure 3.

CA9 Showed Excellent Ability to Distinguish Tumors from Normal Tissue We conducted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess the discriminatory capacity of CA9 between tumor and paired normal samples across various cancers. The results revealed that CA9 exhibited an excellent ability to differentiate between tumor and normal tissues. The area under the curve (AUC) values were notably high, predominantly within the range of 0.8 to 0.9 for several cancers, including BLCA, CESC, CHOL, COAD, HNSC, KIRC, KIRP, LUAD, LUSC, PAAD, READ, and UCEC. Notably, a slightly lower AUC of 0.708 was observed for BRCA ( Figure 3B-N Association Between CA9 Expression and Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes Utilizing the CIBERSORT algorithm, we obtained immune cell infiltration scores spanning 22 categories in a total of 39 tumors. We subsequently calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients to assess the relationship between CA9 expression and immune cell infiltration scores. Notably, we observed significant correlations between CA9 expression and immune infiltration in 37 out of the 39 cancer types investigated. Across most cancers, CA9 demonstrated a predominantly negative correlation with the infiltration levels of the 22 immune cell categories, as illustrated in Figure 4A Figure 4.

(B-J) Correlation between CA9 expression and ESTIMATE score in GBMLGG, KIPAN, and KIRC. Moreover, upon calculating stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE scores for each patient using the R package ESTIMATE, we discovered that CA9 expression was significantly positively correlated with stromal, immune, and overall ESTIMATE scores in GBMLGG, KIPAN, and KIRC, as depicted in Figure 4B J CA9 Expression and Immune Gene Correlations Furthermore, gene correlation analyses were conducted to explore the associations between CA9 expression and immune pathway marker genes, including chemokines, receptors, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, immunoinhibitors, and immunostimulators.

CA9 and Immunotherapy TMB, MSI, and DNA methylation are pivotal factors influencing immunotherapy outcomes, including responses to immune checkpoint therapy. Consequently, we investigated the associations between CA9 expression and these crucial factors. First, we explored CA9 genetic alterations across cancers via cBioPortal. The frequency of genetic variation in CA9 was highest in PAAD (6.52%) and was predominantly amplified. The second and third highest frequencies of CA9 were found in HNSC (5.35%) and UCEC (4.61%), respectively, and were predominantly amplified and mutated ( Figure 6C Figure 6. CA9 mutation landscape (C) and its correlation with TMB (A), MSI (B), DNAss (D). We subsequently examined the correlation between CA9 expression and TMB, MSI, and DNA methylation. CA9 expression was significantly positively correlated with TMB in 12 tumor types, including GBMLGG ( R P R P R P R P R P R P R P R P R P R P R P R P Figure 6A Figure 6B  42 Figure 6D Single-cell Gene Function Analysis To elucidate the intricate mechanisms governed by CA9, we performed gene function analyses at the single-cell level via CancerSEA. The results revealed a positive correlation between CA9 expression and key cellular processes, including hypoxia, metastasis, angiogenesis, and stemness ( Figure 7A Figure 7. Single cell gene function analysis of CA9 across Pan-cancer (A) and in individual cancer types (B-H). *P < .05. **P < .01. ***P < .001. In contrast, a negative correlation was observed between CA9 and processes associated with DNA repair, apoptosis, DNA damage, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis in UM. Additionally, negative correlations with DNA repair and inflammation were noted in BRCA, whereas negative correlations with DNA repair, the cell cycle, and DNA damage were observed in RB. Cellular Localization and Tissue Expression of CA9 Understanding its cellular localization is crucial for comprehending its functional importance, particularly in the context of cancer biology and the development of targeted therapies. Through IF staining of A431 cells, we determined the subcellular localization of CA9. As a membrane protein, CA9 strongly fluoresces on the surface of the cell membrane ( Figure 8A Figure 8B-F Figure 8G Figure 8. Immunofluorescence (IF) of CA9 in A431 cell (A) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in HPA tumor/normal tissue (B-F) and validation cohort (G and H). Discussion Owing to lifestyle changes and advances in screening and treatments, overall cancer mortality has been declining over the years.  43 As a transmembrane isoenzyme that mediates the regulation of acidity within and outside the cell membrane, the normal expression of CA9 is limited to the gastric epithelium, bile ducts, choledochal ducts, pancreatic ducts, rapidly proliferating normal cells of the small intestine, and, to a lesser extent, the central nervous system.  44 7 16 45 The tumor microenvironment consists of complex tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, the extracellular matrix, and the vasculature and is generally hypoxic and acidic.  46  47  48 3 − 2 2 49 + Owing tumor heterogeneity, the correlation between CA9 and immune-related genes varies from tumor to tumor. High CA9 expression corresponds to low expression of chemokines, receptors, MHC, immunoinhibitors, and immunostimulators in CHOL, MESO, SARC, STAD, STES, THCA, HNSC, and CESC, but the reverse is true in other tumors. The use of immunotherapy has increased owing to the discovery of immune checkpoints (programed death (PD)-1, PD ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4) and the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. 50 51  52 TMB and MSI are also reliable biomarkers of prognosis in various cancers and predictors of the efficacy of immunotherapy in many cancers, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck cancer. 53 55 Single-cell functional analysis revealed that CA9 is significantly associated with hypoxia and angiogenesis in BRCA, CRC, GBM, RB, and RCC. HIF-1a is highly expressed under hypoxic conditions, which in turn promotes the upregulation of CA9 expression,  18  56  57 In summary, this study revealed the expression patterns of CA9 in various cancers and its association with prognosis. While initial bias assessment was performed using our laboratory’s constrained dataset, the statistical power necessitates expanded validation through independent cohorts and orthogonal experimental approaches. We found that certain variants of CA9 are significantly associated with poorer survival and a higher risk of disease recurrence in certain types of cancer. This discovery not only emphasizes the importance of CA9 as a potential biomarker, but also provides a theoretical basis for personalized treatment strategies based on CA9. Inhibitors targeting CA9 (SLC-0111) are currently in early clinical trials and have shown good safety and certain anti-tumor activity, paving the way for further exploration of their potential as therapeutic targets.  58 Conclusion In conclusion, this comprehensive pan-cancer study of CA9 highlights its diverse roles and potential clinical significance. The differential expression of CA9 across multiple cancers underscores its utility as a potent marker for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. In addition, the correlations between CA9 expression and the TME, TMB, MSI, DNAss, etc., show that CA9 is a valuable tool for evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapies. The role of CA9 in tumorigenesis and development needs to be further investigated. Considering its broad impact across different cancer types, CA9 has emerged as an excellent candidate for future individualized targeted therapies.
