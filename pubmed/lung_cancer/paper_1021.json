Background Rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) is a major global public health challenge. Household close contacts (HHCs) of RR-TB patients face a high risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Methods Using a cross-sectional design, HHCs of RR-TB patients diagnosed at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center from October 1, 2023, to March 30, 2025, were enrolled. Clinical data were collected via a self-designed questionnaire including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), relationship to index case, living environment, chronic comorbidities, medication history, and TBD-suspicious symptom screening. TBD screening used chest digital radiography (DR) or computed tomography (CT). Clinical data of index cases were extracted from the hospital information system (HIS), covering sputum acid-fast bacillus smear, sputum mycobacterial culture, sputum molecular testing for M. tuberculosis, fluoroquinolone resistance, extent of pulmonary lesions, and cavitation status. TB infection screening employed tuberculin skin test (TST), ESAT6-CFP10 fusion protein skin test (EC), or interferon-γ release assays (IGRA). Infection status was categorized as uninfected, LTBI, or TBD based on screening results, clinical symptoms, and imaging findings. Incidence rates of LTBI and TBD were calculated. Chi-square tests compared clinical characteristics across infection states. Multivariable logistic regression analyzed factors associated with LTBI and TBD (versus uninfected). Results 264 HHCs from 197 RR-TB index cases were included: 113 males (42.8 %), 151 females (57.2 %), aged 3–78 years (mean 42.4 ± 15.1). Among 209 participants tested with TST: 117 (44.3 %) had induration diameter [0, 5) mm, 17 (6.4 %) [5, 10) mm, 30 (11.4 %) [10, 15) mm, 45 (17.1 %) ≥ 15 mm. Among 46 EC-tested: 29 (11.0 %) had [0, 5) mm, 17 (6.4 %) ≥ 5 mm. Among 9 IGRA-tested: 1 (0.4 %) negative, 8 (3.0 %) positive. After cluster-effect adjustment, LTBI incidence was 31.2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 25.8–38.3), TBD incidence 9.9 % (95 % CI: 6.4–13.6). The proportion of spousal relationships to index cases was higher in LTBI/TBD groups than uninfected (P < 0.05). BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 Conclusion High LTBI and TBD rates exist among RR-TB HHCs in this region. Spousal relationship is a risk factor for both LTBI and TBD; positive TBD symptoms and pulmonary cavitation in index cases correlate with TBD. Active screening for RR-TB HHCs and risk-stratified control strategies are recommended to block transmission chains.

However, real-world data on RR-TB infection status remain scarce. The Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu (CDPHCC), the foremost TB diagnosis and treatment facility in southwestern China, plays a pivotal role in regional drug-resistant TB control. This center initiated a cross-sectional survey using active case-finding to evaluate LTBI and TBD incidence among RR-TB patients’ HHCs in this region and identify associated risk factors, thereby providing evidence to optimize precision RR-TB control strategies. 2 Methods 2.1 Study population and setting This single-center cross-sectional study was conducted at CDPHCC with approval from its Ethics Committee. From October 1, 2023, to March 31, 2025, HHCs of RR-TB patients meeting inclusion criteria were consecutively enrolled from the Tuberculosis Department of CDPHCC. 2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria (1) Inclusion criteria: ① Family members confirmed as RR-TB patients by molecular or phenotypic drug susceptibility testing of sputum; ② Direct co-residence with the index case (confirmed RR-TB family member) for ≥ 3 months before diagnosis until 14 days after treatment initiation [ 7 8 2.3 Study methods (1) Clinical data were collected using a self-designed questionnaire developed through literature review, expert consultation, and research team discussions. Uniformly trained investigators conducted face-to-face interviews. Questionnaire items included: gender, age, body mass index (BMI), relationship to index case, residence (urban/farming-pastoral areas), comorbidities and medication history (diabetes, cardiovascular/endocrine diseases, malignancy, AIDS, long-term glucocorticoid/immunosuppressant use), and TBD symptom screening (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss). (2) Index case data extracted: sputum acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear, mycobacterial culture, molecular test results, and chest imaging features. (3) Participants underwent one TB infection test (per preference): tuberculin skin test (TST), ESAT6-CFP10 fusion protein skin test (EC), or interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs). (4) Chest digital radiography (DR) or computed tomography (CT) screened for TB; those with imaging abnormalities received confirmatory pathogen testing. (5) Participants were categorized as uninfected, latent TB infection (LTBI), or TBD. Intergroup differences were analyzed via univariate analysis. (6) Factors with statistical significance in univariate analysis were included in multivariable analysis to identify independent risk factors for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 2.4 Outcomes and definitions Primary outcomes: LTBI and TBD incidence. MTB infection was defined by any of: ① PPD induration ≥ 5 mm in children < 5 years without BCG vaccination, HIV+, ≥1-month immunosuppressant use, or exposure to bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB; ② PPD induration ≥ 10 mm in BCG-vaccinated individuals; ③ EC erythema and/or induration ≥ 5 mm; ④ IGRA positivity. LTBI: Positive MTB infection without TBD symptoms or chest imaging findings [ 7 8 9 2.5 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using R software (version 4.4.1). Categorical data are presented as “n (%)”; normally distributed continuous variables as “mean ± standard deviation”; non-normally distributed variables as “median (Q1, Q3)”. Chi-square tests and one-way ANOVA compared characteristics across infection states. Multinomial logistic regression identified independent risk factors for MTB infection. Clustering effects were adjusted via generalized estimating equations (GEE). Testing was 2-sided with significance set at P < 0.05 based on score tests. 3 Results 3.1 Demographic data A total of 264 HHCs from 197 RR-TB index cases were enrolled, including 113 males (42.8 %) and 151 females (57.2 %), aged 3–78 years (mean 42.4 ± 15.1 years). 3.2 Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection status Among participants, 209 (79.2 %) underwent TST, 46 (17.4 %) received EC, and 9 (3.4 %) completed IGRA ( Table 1 Table 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis Detection method Result N (%) Tuberculin skin test (TST), mm Absent 55(20.8) [0, 5) 117(44.3) [5, 10) 17(6.4) [10, 15) 30(11.4) ≥15 45(17.1) ESAT6-CFP10 (EC), mm Absent 218(82.6) [0, 5) 29(11.0) ≥5 17(6.4) Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) Absent 255(96.6) Negative 1(0.4) Positive 8(3.0) Among 26 TBD cases, 8 had bacteriologically confirmed TB: all 8 were acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-negative, but positive by molecular testing and culture; drug susceptibility testing identified RR-TB in 7 and rifampicin-susceptible TB in 1. The remaining 18 were clinically diagnosed based on symptoms and imaging without bacteriological confirmation. 3.3 Comparison of clinical characteristics across infection states Contacts with a spousal relationship to the index case showed a higher proportion in LTBI and TBD groups versus uninfected (P < 0.05); BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 Table 2 Table 2 Variations in clinical characteristics among household contacts of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis patients by infection status (n = 264).

Epidemiological models predict that by 2050, China will experience 60 %, 48 %, and 35 % increases in the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of drug-resistant tuberculosis, respectively—a growth trend significantly higher than that of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [ 10 11 Previous studies report MTB infection rates among RR-TB patients' HHCs ranging from 18.6 % to 40.8 % [ 3 4 [12] [13] [14] [3] [4] [5] 5 15 16 13 16 This study found that spousal relationship to the index case was significantly associated with both LTBI and TBD in HHCs, suggesting that spouses sharing living spaces and having frequent close contact face elevated infection risks. Positive symptom screening (World Health Organization [WHO]-recommended four-symptom screen: cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss) was significantly associated with TBD, indicating that symptom screening remains a simple, economical, and effective method for early TBD detection. In this study, pulmonary cavitation in index cases correlated with TBD development in HHCs (LTBI incidence was also higher but did not reach statistical significance). The clinical implications are not fully understood but may relate to longer potential disease courses and bacillary excretion durations in cavitary pulmonary TB patients. Other studies have identified malnutrition, advanced age, and low socioeconomic status as factors increasing MTB infection risk among RR-TB patients' HHCs [ 4 12 13 17 18 Preventive treatment for LTBI is a critical strategy for controlling TB transmission. Approximately 5 %–10 % of LTBI cases may progress to TBD [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 9 8 25 26 This study has limitations. First, as a single-center study with a limited sample size, we maximized enrollment during the study period to enhance reliability. Second, conducted in a hospital setting, many participants were accompanying persons of index cases; long-term caregiving may increase infection risk, while other family members with less frequent contact were not surveyed, potentially overestimating true infection rates. Additionally, complex transmission chains may exist in high TB burden areas, and we cannot entirely exclude extra-household transmission sources among participants. Whether this affects preventive therapy strategies requires further investigation. 5 Conclusion High LTBI and TBD incidence rates exist among RR-TB patients' HHCs in this region. Spousal relationship increases infection risk, and positive symptom screening correlates with TBD. High-risk populations warrant prioritized attention in clinical practice to enhance RR-TB prevention and control efficiency.
