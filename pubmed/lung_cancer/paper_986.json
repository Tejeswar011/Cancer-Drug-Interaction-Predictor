See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND Neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radical gastrectomy is a safe and effective treatment for elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer. Despite the increased risk of pulmonary complications, such as pleural effusion and pulmonary infection, postoperative recovery time and survival outcomes are similar to younger patients. AIM To investigate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radical gastrectomy in elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer by comparing treatment-related complications, surgical outcomes, and long-term survival between elderly patients (≥ 65 years) and younger patients (< 65 years). METHODS The clinical data of 148 patients with advanced gastric cancer in elderly patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our hospital from January 2015 to October 2023 were retrospectively analyzed, and these patients were divided into young and middle-aged groups (111 patients) and elderly groups (37 patients), and their clinicopathology and prognosis were compared.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Research subjects A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with advanced gastric cancer in elderly patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radical gastrectomy in our hospital from January 2015 to October 2023. This study complied with the Hippocratic Oath, and have obtained patient informed consent for treatment and approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Tangdu Hospital of Air Force Medical University, No. 2024070385.  Inclusion criteria:  Exclusion criteria: Treatment plan Patients routinely receive 2 or more cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which mainly includes the sex-determining region Y-box regimen and fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin regimen. After 2-3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients routinely undergo hematology, computed tomography, and digestive endoscopy to assess their disease status. Adverse reactions during neoadjuvant chemotherapy were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (V3.0). Patients with grade 3 or above serious adverse reactions are given necessary medical care. Surgical timing and approach were established through comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team. Tumor response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy was evaluated using the tumor regression grade (TRG) classification in accordance with the American Cancer Society Gastric Cancer Staging System, 8 th Follow-up visit A comprehensive, standardized follow-up protocol was implemented for all patients. During the first two years post-surgery, patients underwent thorough clinical evaluations every 3 months to 4 months, which included physical examination, laboratory tests (complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and cancer antigen 72-4), and imaging studies (abdominal and pelvic computed tomography, chest radiography). For patients in their third to fifth post-operative years, these comprehensive assessments were conducted at 6-month intervals. After the fifth year, annual evaluations were deemed sufficient for long-term surveillance. Follow-up data were meticulously collected through both in-person outpatient consultations and structured telephone interviews with patients or their family members. The final follow-up data collection was completed in February 2024, providing a minimum potential follow-up period of 4 months for the most recently recruited patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) was precisely defined as the interval between the date of surgical intervention and the first documented evidence of disease recurrence, metastasis, or death from any cause. OS was calculated as the time from the date of surgery until death from any cause or until the final follow-up date for patients who remained alive. Observation indices The outcome measures were comprehensively categorized to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radical gastrectomy in elderly patients with gastric cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy parameters included the specific regimen administered (sex-determining region Y-box, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, or other protocols), number of treatment cycles completed, and treatment-related complications categorized according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (V3.0). Dose modifications and treatment delays due to adverse events were also documented, along with pre- and post-neoadjuvant clinical staging assessments to evaluate initial response. Surgical and postoperative pathological indicators encompassed the interval between completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, surgical approach (laparoscopic, open, or conversion), extent of gastrectomy, quantified intraoperative blood loss, operative time, incision length, lymph node harvest, and achievement of R0 resection. Detailed tumor regression grade according to the 8 th Comorbidity assessment Comorbidities were systematically assessed and documented for all patients through comprehensive evaluation of medical history, physical examination, and thorough review of medical records. The assessment included cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and cerebrovascular disease), pulmonary diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and other chronic respiratory conditions), endocrine disorders (diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders), renal diseases (chronic kidney disease and renal insufficiency), and other significant conditions including liver disease, previous malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and neurological conditions. The presence and severity of each comorbidity were recorded according to standard clinical diagnostic criteria and classified as present or absent. For patients with multiple comorbidities, all conditions were documented individually, and the assessment was performed by the treating physician team and verified through multidisciplinary consultation when necessary. Statistical analysis SPSS 26.0 statistical software was used for data analysis. The statistical data were analyzed via χ 2 via P RESULTS Baseline data A comprehensive analysis included 148 patients in total, with 37 elderly patients (average age 68 years, range 65-76 years) and 111 young and middle-aged patients (average age 54 years, range 28-64 years). Prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, clinical staging in the elderly group revealed stage II disease in 4 patients (10.8%) and stage III disease in 33 patients (89.2%). Similarly, in the young and middle-aged group, 13 patients (11.7%) presented with stage II disease, while 98 patients (88.3%) had stage III disease. Comparison of baseline characteristics between the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group showed no statistically significant differences (all P 1 Table 1 Comparison of baseline data between two groups of gastric cancer patients (cases)  Clinical indicators  Number of cases  Middle aged and young group ( n  Elderly group ( n   χ 2   P Gender 0.062 0.803 Female 26 20 6 - - Male 122 91 31 0.885 0.347 Underlying disease No 105 81 24 - - Yes 43 30 13 - - BMI (kg/m 2 - 22.9 ± 4.3 21.9 ± 2.7 1.369 0.245 Tumor site 0.997 0.607 Upper part of stomach 94 69 25 Middle part of stomach 19 16 3 Lower part of stomach 35 26 9 Clinical stages 0.022 0.882 Phase II 17 13 4 Phase III 131 98 33 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen 4.214 0.239 FOLFOX 81 66 15 SOX 55 37 18 XELOX 7 5 2 FLOT 5 3 2 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycle 0.225 0.635 < 3 73 56 17 ≥ 3 75 55 20 Operation 0.580 0.446 Laparoscope 80 58 22 Openness 68 53 15 Postoperative chemotherapy 0.379 0.538 No 46 33 13 Yes 102 78 24 BMI: Body mass index; FOLFOX: Fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; SOX: Sex-determining region Y-box; XELOX: Capecitabine and oxaliplatin; FLOT: Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, taxotere.

DISCUSSION Neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radical gastrectomy can significantly increase the R0 resection rate and improve the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer[ 17 18 20 Chemotherapy-related adverse reactions are important for evaluating the safety of chemotherapy[ 21 23 24 25 The significantly higher incidence of pleural effusion and pulmonary infection in elderly patients observed in our study can be attributed to multiple age-related physiological changes and risk factors that collectively compromise respiratory function and recovery capacity. Age-related pulmonary function decline represents a fundamental contributing factor. Elderly patients typically experience progressive deterioration in lung mechanics, including reduced lung capacity, decreased respiratory muscle strength, impaired gas exchange efficiency, and diminished cough reflex. These changes result in inadequate clearance of respiratory secretions and increased susceptibility to atelectasis and pneumonia following major abdominal surgery. The physiological stress of radical gastrectomy, combined with the effects of general anesthesia and postoperative pain, further compromises already diminished respiratory reserve in elderly patients. Compromised immune function significantly contributes to increased infection risk in elderly patients. Age-related decline in both innate and adaptive immunity results in reduced ability to mount effective inflammatory responses against pathogens, delayed pathogen clearance, and impaired tissue repair mechanisms. This immunological vulnerability is further exacerbated by the immunosuppressive effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, creating a synergistic effect that predisposes elderly patients to postoperative infections, particularly pulmonary infections. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can easily lead to tissue edema and increase the difficulty of radical gastrectomy[ 26 27 28 31 32 34 The tumor response after neoadjuvant therapy is significantly correlated with the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer patients[ 35 36 40 41 43 44 There are several limitations to this study. First, the selection bias inherent in retrospective studies cannot be avoided. Second, the patients included in this study had a long time span, and most of them could not detect the mismatch repair status, and there were differences in the selection of neoadjuvant therapy during this period. In addition, there may be bias in the documentation of perioperative complications. Therefore, a large-scale prospective study is needed to further verify the results. Limitation We acknowledge that our study did not employ standardized comorbidity scoring systems such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index or the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system. The use of such validated scoring tools would have provided more objective quantification of comorbidity burden and enhanced the comparability of our results with other studies. This represents a limitation of our retrospective study design and will be addressed in future prospective investigations. The comorbidity data were used to inform treatment decision-making, perioperative risk stratification, and postoperative care protocols, with particular attention to patients with conditions that might affect surgical outcomes or chemotherapy tolerance. CONCLUSION Elderly patients with gastric cancer have good tolerance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and do not significantly increase the incidence of related adverse reactions. The operative effect and overall postoperative complication rate of elderly patients are similar to those of middle-aged and young patients, the overall postoperative recovery speed is faster, and the long-term prognosis is good. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radical gastrectomy is safe and effective in elderly patients with gastric cancer, but the incidence of postoperative pleural effusion and pulmonary infection in elderly patients is significantly increased, and clinicians should pay attention to this combination.
