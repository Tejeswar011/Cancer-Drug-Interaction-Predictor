Tenuigenin, a bioactive compound derived from Polygala tenuifolia, possesses broad pharmacological effects, but its role in adult pneumonia remains incompletely understood. Methods Bioinformatics and database analysis were employed to screen and analyze the Tenuigenin target genes relevant to adult pneumonia. Cell functions were assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, transwell, tube formation, Fluo-4 calcium assay, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) assays. Protein levels were measured by western blot. Network pharmacology and molecular docking were employed to screen core target genes and verify binding interactions. Results Tenuigenin targets in adult pneumonia were enriched in the pathways related to vascular permeability and calcium signaling. Tenuigenin mitigated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced impairment of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC) viability, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, while attenuating LPS-induced increases in apoptosis, calcium ion, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Besides, Tenuigenin also attenuated the TER decrease and permeability increase caused by LPS exposure in HPMECs. Network pharmacology and molecular docking identified steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) as a core target of Tenuigenin, demonstrating binding to specific SRC amino acid residues. Tenuigenin also reduced LPS-induced increase in phosphor-SRC (p-SRC) expression. Crucially, after inhibition of SRC kinase activity, Tenuigenin no longer exerted significant protective effects against LPS-induced HPMEC injury and dysfunction. Conclusion Tenuigenin alleviates LPS-induced injury and dysfunction of HPMECs by targeting the SRC pathway, providing a target for managing adult pneumonia.

It predominantly affects children and the elderly with chronic conditions [ 1 2 3 Tenuigenin, the primary active constituent extracted from the roots of Polygala tenuifolia, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) is a tyrosine kinase and proto-oncogene up-regulated in multiple cancers, where it plays an oncogenic role [ 12 13 14 This study elucidates the mechanism by which Tenuigenin ameliorates adult pneumonia through the SRC pathway, utilizing a combination of network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular biology experiments. It aims to provide new insights for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of adult pneumonia. Materials and methods Target screening and bioinformatics analysis Tenuigenin targets were obtained from the SwissTargetPrediction database ( http://old.swisstargetprediction.ch/help.php https://www.genecards.org/ These 78 targets were input into the String website ( https://cn.string-db.org/ The SangerBox ( http://sangerbox.com/ The TOP 10 hub genes were screened using the CytoHubba (a Cytoscape plugin) based on maximum neighborhood component (MNC), maximal clique centrality (MCC), and Degree values. SRC was identified as a top hub gene and selected for further investigation. Cell culture and treatment The HPMECs supplied by Wuhan Pricella Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China) were cultured in the HPMEC complete medium (Pricella) at 37℃ in a humidified 5% CO 2 Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) The HPMECs (5 × 10 3 5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining Cell proliferation was detected using the EdU Cell Proliferation Kit with Alexa Fluor 647 (Epizyme, Shanghai, China). After treatment, HPMECs in 48-well plates were incubated with 2×EdU working solution for 2 h. After that, the cells were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized, treated with Click reaction solution for 30 min away from light, and nuclei were stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2’-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min avoiding light. The images were obtained under the microscope (Keyence, Shanghai, China). Transwell assay The treated cells suspended in serum-free medium were spread into the upper chambers of the transwell plate, and the lower chambers were added with complete medium. After culturing for 24 h, the cells remaining on the upper chamber membrane surface were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10 min. Following air drying, the cells were photographed under the microscope (Keyence) and quantitatively studied using the Image J software. Tube formation assay The starved HPMECs were re-suspended in HPMEC complete medium and inoculated into a 24-well plate pre-coated with Matrigel (Corning, Corning, New York (NY), USA). After the cells were treated with different conditions and cultured for 24 h, the images were obtained under the microscope (Keyence). Quantitative analysis was performed using the Angiogenesis Analyzer plugin in Image J software. Flow cytometry For apoptosis, the cells treated with different conditions were collected in centrifuge tubes after centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min, resuspended in Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) binding solution, and sequentially added with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide(PI). After reaction at 25℃ for 20 min away from light, the cells were detected using the flow cytometer (BeckmanCoulter, Pasadena, California (CA), USA). The steps were conducted according to the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Beyotime). For reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, the collected cells were treated with 2’, 7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Beyotime) at 37℃ for 20 min. Following washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), intracellular ROS levels were measured using the flow cytometer (BeckmanCoulter). Calcium ion level detection The cells were spread into 24-well plates and treated as indicated. After washing with PBS, the cells were loaded with Fluo-4 staining solution and reacted at 37℃ for 30 min away from light. Fluorescence intensity, reflecting intracellular calcium concentration, was determined using the fluorescence microscope (Keyence). The above steps were conducted using the Fluo-4 Calcium Assay Kit (Beyotime). Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) assay The cells were seeded onto Matrigel (Corning)-coated transwell inserts and cultured to form confluent monolayers. After treatment, TER was tested under the Millipore Millicell ERS-2 Voltohmmeter (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts (MA), USA). Cell permeability assay The treated HPMEC monolayers on transwell inserts were cultured for 24 h. Then, the medium in the upper chambers was replaced with the medium containing 10 µg/mL FITC-labeled Dextran (40 kDa, Beyotime), while the lower chambers contained PBS. After culturing for 1 h away from light, the PBS in the lower chambers was collected for the detection using a SpectraMax Gemini EM Fluorescence Microplate (Moleculardevices, Shanghai, China). Western blot The total protein was isolated from the cells using the Proteintech Cell Total Protein Extraction Kit (Proteintech, Wuhan, China). Protein samples were mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) protein Loading Buffer, denatured at 100℃ for 10 min, separated on SurePAGE™ Protein Precast Gels (Genscript, Nanjing, China) at 140 V for 1 h, and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Beyotime). Membranes were subsequently closed by the 5% skim milk and incubated with anti-vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) (1:1000, #2500, Cell signaling technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-Zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) (1:1000, #13663, Cell signaling technology), anti-phosphor-SRC (p-SRC) (1:5000, ab185617, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom (UK)), anti-SRC (1:2000, 25978-1-AP, Proteintech), or anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (1:2500, ab9485, Abcam) at 4℃ overnight. Membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (1:10000, SA00001-2, Proteintech) at 37℃ for 2 h. Protein bands were visualized using the ChemiDoc™ Imaging System (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and band intensities were quantified using the Image Lab software. Molecular Docking The three dimensions (3D) structures of Tenuigenin and SRC were downloaded from the Pubchem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ https://www.rcsb.org/ Statistical analysis Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was applied to conduct data analysis. Differences between groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). P Results Screening the targets of tenuigenin in adult pneumonia The 2D structure diagram of Tenuigenin is shown in Fig. 1 1 1 1 1  Fig. 1 The target screen of Tenuigenin in adult pneumonia. ( A B C D E F Tenuigenin enhances the viability of LPS-induced HPMECs Treatment of HPMECs with increasing concentrations of Tenuigenin (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 µg/mL) showed no effect on viability at 1, 2, and 4 µg/mL, but significantly reduced viability at 8 and 16 µg/mL (Fig. 2 2  Fig. 2 Tenuigenin promotes the viability of LPS-induced HPMECs. ( A B * P ** P *** P Tenuigenin reverses LPS-induced apoptosis, calcium ions, and ROS levels To examine the effects of Tenuigenin on LPS-induced HPMEC functions, the experiments were performed. Tenuigenin mitigated LPS-induced reductions in EdU-positive cells, migrated cells, and angiogenesis (Fig. 3 3 3  Fig. 3 Tenuigenin mitigates LPS-induced HPMEC dysfunction.

Analysis of the TOP 10 hub genes from the PPI network using the MNC, MCC, and Degree values of CytoHubba identified SRC as the TOP gene by MNC and Degree criteria (Fig. 5 5 5 5 5  Fig. 5 SRC is the target of Tenuigenin in adult pneumonia. ( A B C D E F *** P Tenuigenin mitigates HPMEC injury and dysfunction caused by LPS via the SRC pathway To better explain the functional role of Tenuigenin and SRC in LPS-induced HPMEC injury, the SRC kinase inhibitor AZM475271 was used for mechanistic validation experiments. Both Tenuigenin and AZM475271 attenuated the LPS-induced increase in p-SRC expression; their combination showed a trend towards further reduction, but this was not statistically significant (Fig. 6 6 6 6 1  Fig. 6 Tenuigenin weakens LPS-induced HPMEC injury and dysfunction through the SRC pathway. The HPMECs were treated with LPS, Tenuigenin, and AZM475271. ( A B C D E F G H I J * P ** P *** P Discussion Compared with Western medicine treatment, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment is often favored for its lower side effects and costs. TCM offers significant benefits in preventing and treating pneumonia through multi-targets and multi-pathway regulation [ 15 1−42 16 17 18 19 11 Calcium ions are crucial intracellular second messengers. In ECs, abnormal elevation of calcium ions (calcium overload) leads to dysfunction and damage [ 20 21 20 21 22 23 22 24 25 20 23 26 24 20 21 In recent years, network pharmacology has become a valuable tool in TCM research, providing multi-directional insights for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases [ 27 28 SRC kinase plays an important role in EC injury. Under pathological conditions such as inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion, SRC activation promotes the inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of ECs [ 29 30 31 34 In conclusion, this study proposes a novel mechanism by which Tenuigenin alleviates adult pneumonia. These findings indicate that Tenuigenin inhibits LPS-induced injury and dysfunction of HPMECs by inhibiting SRC pathway activity, revealing that the SRC pathway serves as a potential new target for intervening in LPS-induced pulmonary endothelial injury for the first time, laying a crucial theoretical foundation for developing more precise treatment strategies for adult pneumonia based on Tenuigenin or its derivatives. While in vitro cell models, particularly using a single cell type (such as HPMECs in this study), are invaluable for elucidating specific cellular mechanisms, they cannot fully mimic the complex in vivo microenvironment or simulate the interactions between multiple cell types (such as immune cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts) during adult pneumonia progression. The lack of in vivo experimental data (such as LPS-induced mouse pneumonia model) in the current research is a significant limitation, hindering direct extrapolation of in vitro findings to the whole disease process. In future studies, animal models will be used to verify the core findings presented here and explore Tenuigenin’s effects within the physiologically complex environment of adult pneumonia, providing a more comprehensive assessment of its therapeutic potential.
