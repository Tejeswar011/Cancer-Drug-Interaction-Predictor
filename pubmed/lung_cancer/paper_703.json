While body mass index (BMI) is suggested as a risk factor for postoperative breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), evidence is inconsistent. This meta-analysis systematically evaluates BMI’s impact on postoperative lymphedema to resolve discrepancies and provide accurate insights. Methods The authors conducted comprehensive literature searches from inception to October 7, 2024, in major English-language databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. To assess the association between BMI and postoperative BCRL, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were also performed to evaluate the impact of BMI on postoperative lymphedema in breast cancer patients across different geographic regions. Results This meta-analysis included 16 studies involving 6,057 postoperative breast cancer patients, with sample sizes ranging from 101 to 1,130. The results revealed a significant association between elevated BMI and postoperative BCRL, with an OR of 2.05 (95% CI, 1.53–2.75; P Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² is a significant risk factor for postoperative lymphedema in breast cancer patients. A comprehensive understanding of BMI’s role in lymphedema development post-surgery can inform clinicians and therapists in designing personalized strategies to mitigate this complication.

Literature search strategy We performed comprehensive electronic searches in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library using multiple keywords simultaneously. The search was restricted to clinical trials published in English. Three researchers (W.Z., Z.L., and J.L.) independently extracted data and evaluated potential bias. The search period extended until October 7, 2024. Article screening was conducted independently by two evaluators based on predefined NAE criteria. Discrepancies between evaluators were resolved through re-examination by a third evaluator to achieve consensus. Initially, 1465 articles were identified. After excluding 420 articles based on title and abstract, 30 non-English articles, non-clinical trials, and articles lacking sample sizes or OR, and removing 999 duplicates, 16 studies were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: (1) Published clinical studies in English; (2) Female patients aged 18–85 years; (3) Patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer who underwent surgical intervention; (4) Classification of BMI as a dichotomous variable. Exclusion criteria: (1) Reviews, meta-analyses, editorials, commentaries, or case reports; (2) Studies focusing on benign breast tumors or metastatic disease; (3) Cases of lymphedema induced by non-surgical causes or primary lymphedema. Statistical analysis The following data were extracted from each study: first author’s name, publication year, study design, country, surgical procedure, sample size, follow-up duration, and the definition and measurement method of lymphedema. Evaluations and subgroup analyses were performed using OR and 95% CI. A random-effects model was applied when P I² I² P Results Characteristics of the included studies A comprehensive search across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library yielded 466 records, including studies, international conference reports, and reviews. After removing duplicates, 46 articles were identified as relevant. Following the application of exclusion criteria, 16 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1 2 20 34 1  Fig. 1 Search strings and flowcharts for filtering and research selection Table 1 Main characteristics of included in the present meta-analysis Statistical significance was stated in the case of p Main analyses Meta-analysis of the 16 included studies revealed that patients with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² had a significantly higher risk of developing postoperative breast cancer-related lymphedema compared to those with a BMI < 25 kg/m², with an OR of 2.05 (95% CI, 1.53–2.75; P I² 2  Fig. 2 Forest plots for the effect of BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 2  Fig. 3 Forest plot of the impact of BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 2 Subgroup analyses(regional subgroup) Subgroup analysis revealed that the OR for the nine Asian studies comparing BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² to BMI < 25 kg/m² was 2.19 (95% CI, 1.44–3.33; P I² 3 P 4 P 5  Fig. 4 Forest plot of the impact of the BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 2  Fig. 5 Forest plot of the impact of the BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 2 Subgroup analyses (Lymphedema measurement method subgroup) Subgroup analyses showed differential associations between BMI and risk of lymphedema based on lymphedema assessment methods (Supplementary Fig. 6–7.). In studies using circumferential measurement ( n P n P Discussion In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between BMI and postoperative lymphedema in breast cancer patients. Our results demonstrated a significant association between elevated BMI and an increased risk of postoperative lymphedema. These findings align with those of Bolette S. Rafn et al. (2022) and Ruxing Wu et al. (2019), both of whom reported that higher BMI is a risk factor for lymphedema [ 8 15 20 21 Lymphedema is characterized by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the extracellular space due to disruption of the lymphatic system, which obstructs lymphatic return pathways and prevents the central flow of lymphatic fluid from the distal limbs, leading to the accumulation of protein-rich fluid in soft tissues [ 35 36 37 38 40 41 6 12 42 Given the significant association between BMI and postoperative lymphedema, clinicians should incorporate BMI as a critical factor in assessing the risk of lymphedema during the management of breast cancer patients. BMI demonstrates significant cost-effectiveness as a screening tool for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), particularly in resource-limited settings. Unlike advanced diagnostic modalities (e.g., bioimpedance spectroscopy), BMI requires no specialized equipment or additional training, enabling widespread implementation in primary care and oncology follow-up. By facilitating early identification of high-risk patients, BMI-based screening may reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with advanced lymphedema complications requiring intensive therapies (e.g., complex decongestive therapy). This approach not only identifies at-risk individuals but also directs targeted preventive interventions, thereby enhancing the value of routine postoperative surveillance. Emerging evidence suggests a shift in focus from manual lymphatic drainage to early diagnosis, compression therapy, weight management, and exercise to enhance strength and circulation. Notably, study demonstrated that structured weight loss programs (e.g.: diet, exercise) significantly reduced lymphedema incidence, supporting proactive interventions in obese patients [ 43 A key strength of this meta-analysis lies in its integration of multiple studies from diverse geographic regions, providing a large and highly representative sample size. The inclusion of data from various regions enhances the generalizability of the findings by encompassing a broader population and diverse demographic characteristics. Furthermore, the diversity of the studies helps mitigate potential biases that may arise from region-specific research. The substantial sample size also strengthens the statistical power and inferential robustness of the results, enabling a more precise assessment of the relationship between the variables. This methodological rigor significantly enhances the external validity of the study, thereby increasing the credibility and reliability of the findings. Our study has several limitations. First, the inclusion of only English-language studies may have excluded relevant literature on the same topic published in other languages, potentially introducing language bias. Second, all data were derived from published literature, and individual patient-level data were not utilized, which may introduce bias into the meta-analysis results. Third, the majority of the included studies were retrospective in design. Retrospective studies are prone to underestimating the incidence of latent lymphedema cases due to the lack of systematic edema assessment. While prospective studies avoid many of these issues, they often suffer from inconsistent definitions and measurement methods for lymphedema. As our study is retrospective, it may be subject to similar limitations. Fourth, Our study has important limitations regarding confounding factors.While BMI was the primary exposure, key variables including surgical extent (ALND vs. SLNB), adjuvant therapies, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) were inconsistently adjusted across studies. These factors may independently affect lymphatic function and interact with BMI. Notably, diabetes may exacerbate microvascular damage while ALND increases lymphatic trauma. The absence of individual patient data precluded comprehensive multivariable adjustment. variability in BMI measurement methods across the included studies may have contributed to heterogeneity in the results. Additionally, many studies did not control for all potential confounding variables, such as physical activity levels and dietary habits, which could simultaneously influence the relationship between BMI and lymphedema. Consequently, our findings may not fully represent the disease progression characteristics in all patients, potentially affecting the interpretation of the results. Fifth, Among the included studies, only 18.8% ( n Conclusions This meta-analysis confirms that obesity and overweight status (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) are significant risk factors for lymphedema following breast cancer surgery. Healthcare professionals should provide comprehensive education to breast cancer survivors, particularly those at high risk of developing lymphedema, to enable early detection of adverse physical changes. Such proactive measures can facilitate timely intervention, potentially preventing the onset of lymphedema and mitigating its associated complications.
