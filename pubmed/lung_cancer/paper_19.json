Cancer patients are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), representing one of the main causes of death. In this paper, we used the ONCOTHROMB12-01 study cohort for the analysis of 18-month overall survival (OS) and cancer-associated venous thrombosis (CAT) cumulative incidence. The OS is described for patients with and without CAT across age, sex, cancer type, stage and presence of recurrent VTE using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Moreover, a Cox regression model with stepwise feature selection is trained to identify predictors of prognosis. Results show an 18-month CAT cumulative incidence of 16.5 % (CI 13.1–21.0 %) and a median OS for patients with CAT of 9.1 months (CI 5.9–12.5). Furthermore, CAT is associated with shorter survival in lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancer in advanced stages, regardless of age and sex; VTE recurrence also reduces survival significantly. The model found ECOG performance status of 2, cancer type, metastatic stage, VTE, mucinous histology and complete tumor resection as meaningful predictors; the latter being the only protective factor. In conclusion, the diagnosis of CAT has a profound impact on OS in the ONCOTHROMB12-01 study regardless of the clinical characteristics of patients.

For example, the analysis of a large Danish population-based cohort showed that cancer patients with VTE presented decreased 1-year survival rate compared to cancer patients without VTE [ 7 8 9 10 11 A concerning fact is that CAT incidence is increasing over time—it has been found that individuals diagnosed with cancer between 2014 and 2017 were in higher risk of venous thrombosis than those between 2005 and 2007 [ 12 13 Most venous thrombosis research has traditionally concentrated on symptomatic DVTs and PEs. Although incidental VTEs and other thrombotic events—such as visceral, catheter-related and superficial vein thromboses—are relatively common in cancer patients [ 13 14 15 In the present article, we utilize the prospective, multi-centric ONCOTHROMB12-01 study cohort to explore how venous thrombosis affects overall survival, including a broader definition of venous thrombosis events as well as incidentally diagnosed thromboses, to provide a more complete picture of its prognostic implications. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study design and participants The ONCOTHROMB12-01 study ( ClinicalTrial.gov NCT03114618 Table S1 2.2 Data collection and data set characteristics At the baseline visit, demographic data, prior medical history—including arterial thromboembolism (ATE) and VTE—, family history of VTE and tumor-related data were recorded. A blood sample was taken for the testing of required lab parameters and genetic profiling. Concomitant VTE episodes that led to the diagnosis of cancer or VTE identified by imaging while performing tumor staging were also recorded and considered as CAT. In our study we approached a wider definition for VTE events that included non-classic venous thrombosis events that were categorized into deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary thromboembolism (PE), catheter-related thrombosis (CRT), superficial venous thrombosis (SVT), and visceral thrombosis (VT). Additionally, both incidental and symptomatic VTEs are reported. 2.3 Data pre-processing Features with little information (e.g. those with small variance or more than 50 % of missing data) were removed from the data set. Levels of categorical variables with few observations were grouped into a single level to reduce data sparsity and thus increase statistical power. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) was chosen as the best approach to deal with missing data, as supported by [ [16] [17] [18] [19] 2.4 Data analysis Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate survival functions and obtain median overall survival (OS) and 18-month OS rate. Differences in survival between patients’ groups were tested with log-rank tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to depict 18-months OS and median OS. Gray’s test is used to estimate CAT cumulative incidence while accounting for the competing risks between death and CAT [ 20 Survival analysis was conducted for the outcome ‘death’. Survival time was computed between the date of cancer diagnosis and the end-point date (considered as either death, patient’s withdrawal from the study, lost to follow-up or last study visit). Patients who did not experience the outcome of interest were right-censored. Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) regression with stepwise feature selection was used to model time until event and, more importantly, find the most influential factors and quantify their individual effects as a hazard ratio (HR). Specifically, we considered that cause-specific hazard regression is better suited for such purpose than Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models in spite of the competing risks setting [ 21 The whole data set is partitioned into training and test set using an 80/20 split, and 10-fold cross-validation is applied on the training set. In each fold, stepwise feature selection is applied during the model’s fitting using the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). Furthermore, the number of times a variable is selected during cross-validation is recorded and the most frequent ones are used to train the final model. This model is evaluated in terms of concordance index (C-index) during cross-validation and on the test set. Time-varying covariates were treated accordingly [ 16 Additionally, a Lasso CPH model is trained following the same schema as described above to validate the final stepwise CPH model, given that Lasso regularization often results in more robust models. More detailed information can be found in Supplementary Material (Tables S6 and S7) Fisher’s exact tests were performed to find associations between categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared between groups using the t 2.5 Software used All statistical analyses were done using R (version 4.4.1). Database management was done using the ‘an9elproject’ (version 0.9.0) and ‘an9elversions’ package (0.3.0). Imputation was done using the ‘mice’ package (version 3.16.0). Packages ‘arsenal’ (version 3.6.3) and ‘ggstatsplot’ (version 0.12.4) were used during exploratory data analysis. Log-rank tests, formatting of the dataset to fit time-varying covariates, CPH regression models and the test of proportional hazards assumption were done using the ‘survival’ package (version 3.5–3). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted with ‘survminer’ (version 0.4.9) and ‘ggfortify’ (version 0.4.14). Stepwise feature selection CPH regression models were trained using the ‘StepReg’ package (version 1.4.4). Finally, the calculation of the VTE cumulative incidence was done using the package ‘tidycmprsk’ (version 1.0.0). 3 Results 3.1 Clinical data Demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort are shown in Table 1 Table 1 Study population characteristics.

More information can be found in the Supplementary Material Table S2 Among all these variables, ECOG performance status, personal history of VTE, cancer type, stage, having had the tumor surgically removed and implantation of a central venous catheter (CVC) are significantly associated with CAT. Within the group of patients under antiaggregant treatment at the beginning of the study, we observe a lower proportion of patients that developed VTE compared to those that did not (9.1 % vs 17.2 %; p-value = 0.06). On another hand, known risk factors such as BMI over 25 kg/m 2 3.2 Venous thrombosis events A total of 88 patients suffered one or more VTEs, which represents 22.6 % of the cohort. Interestingly, VTE was diagnosed concomitantly with the neoplasm for 30 patients, which makes up for 33 % of patients suffering CAT. On the other hand, a total of 11 patients (12.4 % of patients suffering CAT) showed VTE recurrences. Within this subgroup, 10 patients experienced one recurrence, and 1 patient had two recurrences. The 12-month cumulative incidence of VTE in the ONCOTHROMB12-01 cohort is 14.8 % (CI 10.8–19.5 %) and the 18-month cumulative incidence is 18.1 % (CI 13.7–22.3 %). Similar cumulative incidences are found for colorectal, lung and esophago-gastric cancer, with the exception of pancreatic cancer which presents 12- and 18-month CAT cumulative incidences twice as large as the former ones ( Table 2 Fig. 1 Table 2 CAT cumulative incidence for ONCOTHROMB12-01 cohort and stratified by cancer type.

Fig. 1 Cumulative incidence of VTE for 18 months adjusted by competing risk with death (VTE events concomitant to cancer diagnosis are excluded). Regarding types of VTE according to location, most patients presented visceral thrombosis (VT) (n = 26, 29.5 %), followed by PE (n = 23, 26.1 %), DVT (n = 12, 13.6 %), DVT & PE (n = 6, 6.8 %), catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) (n = 5, 5.7 %), DVT & VT (n = 5, 5.7 %), PE & VT (n = 4, 4.5 %), DVT & CRT (n = 3, 3.4 %), DVT & PE & VT (n = 2, 2.3 %), superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) (n = 1, 1.1 %), and DVT & PE & SVT (n = 1, 1.1 %) ( Table S6 Table S7 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Type of VTE events (incidental/symptomatic) according to cancer type. A more in-depth description of the VTE events can be found in the Supplementary Material 3.3 Survival analysis At the end of the study, 149 patients had died, and 241 patients did not experience death and were right-censored. Overall survival (OS) estimate at 18 months for all patients was 63.4 % (CI 58.7–68.5 %). The median survival time cannot be computed since at no time point does half of the cohort die ( Fig. S2 However, it is important to note that 71 % (CI 65.6–76.3 %) of the patients that did not suffered CAT remained alive after 18 months since cancer diagnosis, in contrast with the patients that suffered CAT, of whom only 28.8 % (CI 20–41 %) were alive after this period (log-rank test p-value < 0.001) ( Table 3 Table 3 Fig. 3 Table 3 Median OS (months) and OS at 18 months for all patients and for patients according to age group, gender, primary tumor and TNM stage.

The impact of CAT in a patient's survival was significant regardless of stratification by age, sex, cancer type (except for esophago-gastric cancer); and stages III and IV ( Table 3 Supplementary Material Figs. S1, S2, S3, S4 In addition, to analyze whether CAT recurrence is associated with shorter OS time, a log-rank test comparing three groups of patients — cancer patients with no CAT, patients that suffered CAT once and patients that had CAT recurrence — was performed.

In addition, survival curves for these three groups of patients are shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Kaplan-Meier curves for patients without CAT vs those with CAT but no recurrences vs those with CAT recurrences. In order to identify factors predictive of mortality, a stepwise CPH regression model was trained applying 10-fold cross-validation (mean C-index during cross-validation = 0.8606; C-index on test set = 0.8973). The selected features are presented in Table 5 Table 5 Factors influencing mortality in the ONCOTHROMB12-01 cohort resulting from 10-fold stepwise CPH model (listed from highest to lowest HR). Covariate HR (95 % CI) p-value ECOG performance status = 2 4.19 [2.38–7.37] <0.001 Cancer type Stage IV 2.74 [1.81–5.26] <0.001 VTE 2.08 [1.39–3.11] <0.001 Mucinous histology 1.40 [0.94–2.10] 0.10 Tumor surgically removed 0.28 [0.14–0.56] <0.001 Abbreviations: HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval; NSCLC, non-small cell lung carcinoma; VTE, venous thromboembolism. An ECOG performance status of 2 is the most influential factor of overall survival in our cohort, increasing 4 times the risk of death. As expected, certain types of cancer are associated with lesser survival to varying degrees. Esophago-gastric cancer and non-small cell lung cancer increase almost 2-fold the risk of death in comparison with colorectal cancer; while pancreatic cancer increases it 3-fold, which is in accordance with its aggressiveness. Similarly, patients in stage IV also have an almost 3-fold increased risk of dying compared to patients in earlier and locally advanced stages (I-III). Naturally, VTE is identified as an important factor in mortality prediction. Patients suffering from VTE have a 2-fold increased risk of dying compared to patients with no VTE. Interestingly, mucinous histology is selected during the training of the model as an important predictor, although it is close to being a statistically significant associated risk factor. Last but not least, the single protective factor found is undergoing complete resection of the tumor, which decreases risk of death in 72 %. 4 Discussion Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism poses a significant challenge for cancer patients. In the present work, we leveraged the data from the ONCOTHROMB12-01 cohort to calculate CAT incidence, describe the characteristics of venous thrombosis events, estimate its effect on mortality, and inspect risk and protective factors of overall survival through the creation of predictive models. Importantly, our analysis incorporated incidental and non-classic venous thromboembolic events, which are frequently underrepresented in existing studies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the VTE burden in this population. Our cohort is mainly comprised by Caucasian individuals with a mean age of 64 years old, where women represent a third of the subjects. The cancer types represented are digestive cancers (colorectal, pancreatic, esophageal and gastric) and non-small cell lung cancer, and most individuals are in locally advanced and metastatic stages. Over half of the patients have an ECOG performance status of 1, and two thirds present one or more comorbidities. Almost one quarter of our cohort suffered CAT, either shortly before the beginning of the study or during the observation period. Within this group, 34 % of patients had VTE concomitant to cancer diagnosis, and 13 % suffered VTE recurrence. The estimated CAT cumulative incidence at 12 months is 14.0 % (CI 12.0–19.5 %), which is in agreement with some large cohorts that also gather high VTE risk cancer types [ 12 22 23 24 Approximately 60 % of all VTEs were incidental, and 42 % of them were non-classic VTEs (VTs, CRTs, SVTs). This supports the belief that unprovoked venous thrombosis could be a reliable sign of occult malignancy [ 25 26 Regarding survival, our findings further confirm the association between CAT and poor prognosis. Only 30 % of patients with CAT were alive after 18 months of follow-up, in contrast with 70 % of patients that did not suffer CAT and remained alive. For instance, the 1-year survival rate of cancer patients with VTE in a Danish cohort is 12 % vs 36 % for patients without VTE [ 7 We trained a CPH regression model with automated feature selection, resulting in a model whose C-index on test set was 0.8973. Whitin the set of predictors, we found death risk factors well established in literature, such as an ECOG performance status of 2; pancreatic, NSCLC and esophago-gastric cancer; and stage IV [ 27 28 Also, VTE is selected as an important predictor, and its effect on mortality is on par with that of metastatic disease. It has been found that the presence of malignancy favors thrombosis, and vice versa [3] [29] Mucinous adenocarcinomas are less frequent than other histology types and it is linked to worsened prognosis in lung and digestive system cancers [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] 3 Complete resection of the tumor is considered a protective factor, which makes sense considering that patients that undergo this procedure have a localized tumor that is not yet widely spread. Furthermore, the removal of solid tumors might help prevent a prothrombotic state [ 3 Not only does VTE affect survival, but also the quality of life. The diagnosis of VTE usually leads to hospitalization, and postponement of surgery and systemic therapy. All these mishaps worsen patients’ outcomes [ 13 [13] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] One of the main strengths of our work relies on the study design. This is one of the few prospective studies with 18 months of follow-up for the research of the relationship between cancer and venous thrombosis. The inclusion of digestive and lung cancer patients enabled us to observe a higher number of VTEs, thus increasing power to detect associations. Also, periodical monitoring allowed us to account for non-classic and incidental thromboses, preventing us from underestimating the real incidence and effects of VTE. Apart from that, our approach to survival analysis draws upon Machine Learning methodologies—i.e. dataset partitioning, k-fold cross-validation and feature selection—which alleviates spurious effects that might affect variable selection and prevents model overfitting. Thus, we were able to inspect the importance of features from both a statistical and predictive point of view. We are aware of the limitations of our study. Firstly, the number of patients recruited is modest, and the population sample is limited to mainly Caucasian individuals with five types of cancer, mostly at advanced stages. Caution should be exercised when extrapolating the results shown here to populations of different characteristics. In addition, information related to bleeding events, and cause of death are not accounted for in the ONCOTHROMB12-01 cohort, hindering us from delivering a more comprehensive analysis on cancer-related and VTE-related mortality. We envision several promising avenues for future research. To this end, we will leverage the ONCOTHROMB02 cohort—a recent dataset that not only broadens the population sample but also encompasses new clinical features (i.e. hematological parameters, systemic anti-tumor therapies, antithrombotic treatments), as well as genetic information. Our primary focus will be on the discovery of CAT biomarkers and the development of risk assessment models using Machine Learning. First, we aim to evaluate the predictive capability of potential CAT biomarkers, specifically blood D-dimer levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to this disease. Furthermore, we will examine how systemic anti-cancer therapies, along with antithrombotic treatments administered to patients, contribute to the overall risk of developing CAT. 5 Conclusions In this study, we analyzed data from the ONCOTHROMB12-01 cohort to assess the incidence and prognostic relevance of cancer-associated venous thrombosis. We used a broad definition of VTE that includes incidental and non-classic events to ensure a more accurate estimation of its true clinical burden. Our results confirm that VTE significantly affects overall survival, independent of cancer type, stage or patient demographics, and VTE recurrences are associated with even worse outcomes. Our survival model, developed using Cox Proportional Hazards regression with automated feature selection, identified VTE as a strong, independent predictor of mortality. Given our results, we emphasize the importance of adequate thromboprophylaxis to prevent VTE and subsequent medical complications. Future efforts should aim to improve prognostic and VTE-risk stratification tools.
