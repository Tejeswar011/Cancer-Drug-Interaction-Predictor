A BSTRACT Background: Coronaviruses are from the family of viruses that cause respiratory illness in humans. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans. COVID-19, the new strain of coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The virus has since spread all over the world creating havoc. The zoonotic origin of the virus has been a significant area of investigation. The infected person spreads the virus to two or three other people in a chain reaction-like pattern. India, like many countries, experienced a significant number of confirmed cases and deaths.Variations in fatality rates were observed globally. Purpose: The aim of the study is to study risk factors, clinical profile, and outcomes in hospitalized elderly (age >60) with COVID-19 and the correlation of disease severity with comorbidities and laboratory and radiological parameters by comparing the differences between young elderly (60-70 years old), old elderly (71-80 years old), and very old elderly (>81 years old). It is important to identify the risk factors and high-risk groups to aid early, aggressive intervention, facilitate equitable hospital resources, and alleviate the critical care crisis that has arisen in the country and the world. Method: This is a retrospective observational study of all the hospitalized elderly patients (>60 years old) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to a tertiary care hospital from April 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Data such as clinical history along with associated comorbidities, clinical parameters, radiological imaging, signs and symptoms, treatment given and oxygen requirements, and hospital stay including ICU were collected from a computer-based data acquisition system.

It was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by 60 the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 et al 8 9 Patients with COVID-19 exhibit a broad spectrum of symptoms. Mild to moderate symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, sore throat, diarrhea, chills, and dizziness. Severe presentations can involve dyspnea, persistent fever (≥38°C), confusion, and chest pain or pressure, often requiring urgent medical intervention.[ 10 11 Older adults are disproportionately affected, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, kidney problems, and compromised immunity.[ 12 13 14 Despite extensive global research, data on the clinical progression of COVID-19 in hospitalized elderly patients, particularly from primary care perspectives, remains limited. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 651 confirmed COVID-19 geriatric patients admitted to Medanta Medicity, Gurugram. Among them, 101 required intensive care. The average hospital stay was 8.4 days, with a mean age of 71.8 years among nonsurvivors. The study highlights the criticality of cases in patients aged 60 and older, providing insights into differences in disease progression among young elderly (60–70 years), old elderly (71–80 years), and very old elderly (>80 years). Hypertension (54.5%, n n n n n These findings underscore the importance of proactive management and early intervention in primary care to mitigate poor outcomes in the geriatric population. By offering detailed insights into the clinical course of COVID-19 in elderly patients, this study aims to assist primary care providers and family physicians in optimizing care strategies and improving outcomes for this vulnerable population.[ 15 Materials and Method This multicenter, retrospective study included 651 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to WHO interim guidelines.[ 16 To better understand the diverse characteristics of the older adult population within this cohort, participants were categorized into three distinct age groups: young elderly (60-70 years old), old elderly (71-80 years old), and very old elderly (over 80 years old). This approach acknowledges the progressive changes in health, functional status, and social engagement often observed as individuals advance through later life. The interim guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) outlines the clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when COVID-19 is suspected, emphasizing early recognition, infection prevention and control, and supportive care for hospitalized adult and paediatric patients.[ 17 All the clinical data of these patients such as name, age, sex, clinical symptoms, and laboratory records including nonspecific inflammatory markers, for instance, CRP, D-dimers, serum ferritin, TLC, kidney function test, liver enzymes, PT-INR, treatment is given, oxygen requirement, ICU stay and HRCT chest was recorded from hospital records. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Medanta Institutional Review Board on 24 th Clinical features and outcomes of the different age groups were compared. Definition Table 1 18 Table 1 Different clinical types of presentation in SARS-CoV-2 patients[ 18 Severity of disease Presentation Asymptomatic • No clinical symptoms Mild illness • Fever, sore throat, dry cough, malaise and body aches or Moderate illness • Symptoms of pneumonia (persistent fever and cough) without hypoxemia Severe illness • Pneumonia with hypoxemia (Sp0 2 Critical state • Acute respiratory distress syndrome, along with shock, coagulation defects, encephalopathy, heart failure and acute kidney injury Asymptomatic: Individuals in this category show no clinical symptoms. They test positive via nasal swab, and chest X-rays appear normal. Mild Illness: Symptoms include fever, sore throat, dry cough, malaise, and body aches. Some individuals may experience gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or loose stools. Moderate Illness: Patients have symptoms of pneumonia, such as persistent fever and cough, but without hypoxemia. High-resolution CT scans reveal significant lesions in the lungs. Severe Illness: This group has pneumonia accompanied by hypoxemia, with oxygen saturation levels below 92%. Critical State: Patients experience acute respiratory distress syndrome, along with complications like shock, coagulation defects, encephalopathy, heart failure, and acute kidney injury. Symptoms of SARS-CoV-19 are expected to appear from day 2 to 14 after exposure to the virus; hence, it is recommended to be quarantined for 14 days.[ 19 20 19 20 Results From April 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, 654 total geriatric (>60 years old) were admitted to tertiary care hospitals in India and were SARS-CoV-2 positive (by laboratory-confirmed method). Out of these, 393 patients were above 60-70 years, 204 cases were 71-80 years, and 57 patients were 81 years and above. The median age of all geriatric populations was 68 years (64-74). In this study, 22.8% of females and males comprised 77.2% of the COVID-19 admissions to the hospital.

In young elderly 88.3% of the patients had fever. URTI was noted in more than 60% of the patients. Other symptoms were also prevalent such as generalized weakness and SOB. Likewise, in old elderly, fever in more than 88% of the admitted patients was the most common clinical manifestation, following that was URTI and SOB. At last in the very old elderly, a similar clinical pattern was seen where the fever was the predominant symptom, affecting more than 88% of the patients. The patients also experienced generalized weakness, URTI, and SOB.

A total of 654 elderly patients were included, categorized by age: young elderly (60-70 years), old elderly (71-80 years), and very old elderly (>81 years).[ 5 Geriatric patients made up almost three-fourths of the total admissions in COVID care. Among these, more than 84% of the patients were admitted to the ward, and around 15% required ICU. Very old elderly patients (26.3%) ( P P P 21 The elderly population, especially those with multiple comorbidities, should be considered at high risk for poor outcomes, and primary care providers must prioritize these patients for close monitoring and preventative care, including vaccination and early medical intervention. Sara Hägg et al. 22 Progressing age was linked with higher mortality, and higher death rate in patients 70 years old and above, largely affecting men. Patients having acute kidney injury had a higher number of hospital mortality whereas hypertensive patients were mainly discharged. Further comorbidities (diabetes, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were seen to be noncontributory to either of the outcomes. From a primary care perspective, elderly patients with pre-existing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disorders face a higher risk of progressing to severe illness.[ 23 Fabio Perrotta et al. 24 25 et al 26 27 28 Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is detected in the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which binds with spike protein and causes infection.[ 24 29 30 23 31 23 32 13 Additionally, a large proportion of elderly men (77.2%) were hospitalized compared to women (22.8%), though no significant gender differences were observed in disease outcomes. This finding suggests that while gender may not be a key determinant in disease severity, it remains important for primary care providers to recognize the general higher risk of severe disease in elderly men and adapt care strategies where appropriate. The antiviral drug Remdesivir, a nucleoside triphosphate analog is used in injectable form against SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.[ 33 et al. 34 th 34 Remdesivir notably reduced disease severity, and oxygen requirement in patients who had high oxygen demand, and hence, hospital stay was decreased.[ 33 23 35 The use of corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone, has shown marked improvement in the patient’s condition.[ 23 36 37 38 Another successful treatment used in a small number of severe COVID-19 patients is Tocilizumab injection, an IL-6 receptor antagonist. Prof Giovanni Guaraldi, MD et al. 39 40 23 Guo T et al. 41 Very old patients (>80 years) developed more complications than young old. Comparatively, the risk of hypercoagulability, ARDS, Acute kidney injury, and sepsis also increases with age, with very old patients being the most affected. Similarly, n 41 Clinical presentation in the elderly could be variable ranging from typical, such as fever, dry cough, and dyspnea, to atypical symptoms, such as sore throat, weakness, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, delirium, and chest pain.[ 42 40 42 Adekunle Sanyaolu et al. 43 It is seen that 1 in 6 confirmed cases develop critical conditions with breathing difficulty, especially in geriatrics with comorbidities. Patients with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are more likely to progress to severe illness.[ 44 45 To summarize, geriatric patients with underlying comorbidities are more likely to progress into grave diseases. Clinical manifestations could range from typical or atypical symptoms due to decreased host immune response and altered homeostasis in old age. Very old patients are inclined to develop further disease-related complications than young-old patients. Extra nursing care, vigilant monitoring, and inflammatory biomarkers along with kidney function tests and liver enzymes can be used as predictive indicators to assess the severity of the disease. Finally, the role of primary care providers extends beyond direct clinical care. Education on preventive measures, including proper hygiene, vaccination, and the management of chronic conditions, is key to reducing the risk of severe outcomes in the elderly. As many elderly patients may not present to the hospital until late in the disease course, primary care physicians should be the first line of defense in identifying, managing, and referring at-risk patients for specialized care.
