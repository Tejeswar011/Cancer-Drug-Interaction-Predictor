In Vitro Hemolysis Safety Phospholipids are susceptible to hydrolysis during production and storage, with lysophospholipids being one of the primary degradation products. Elevated concentrations of lysophospholipids can cause cell membrane disruption, leading to hemolysis or cellular necrosis [ 31 32 In vitro hemolysis assays were performed to assess the hemocompatibility of Lip- Celastrol w v Figure 2 Celastrol 2.3. Cellular Uptake Rhodamine B (RhB)-labeled liposomes (RhB-Lips) were selected to evaluate cellular uptake efficiency. In Figure 3 2.4.

In Vivo Toxicity Mice were injected intravenously with the Celastrol Celastrol Figure 7 Celastrol Celastrol Quantitative serum biochemical analysis of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (CRE), and urea (UA) demonstrated that AST and UA levels in the Celastrol Celastrol p Celastrol Celastrol 2.8. In Vivo Biodistribution The biodistribution of liposomes in 4T1 tumor-bearing female BALB/c mice is illustrated in Figure 8 Liposomes in this study were formulated using DSPE-mPEG2000. The “stealth effect” of PEGylation minimized recognition by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), enabling prolonged circulation stability. Furthermore, liposomes with particle sizes within 50–150 nm can achieve targeted tumor accumulation via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [ 33 34 35 2.9.
