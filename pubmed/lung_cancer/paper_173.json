Methods Validation followed the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN). Data collection included a sociodemographic questionnaire, the translated version of LCQ-Brazil (LCQ-Br), self-perception of laryngeal sensitivity, cough frequency and intensity, the Cough Severity Index (CSI-Br), and the Newcastle Laryngeal Hypersensitivity Questionnaire (LHQ-Br). The LCQ-Br retained its original structure with 19 items across physical, psychological, and social domains. Participants completed the LCQ-Br on three occasions to assess validity, reliability, and responsiveness. Results Ninety-eight patients with chronic cough (79% women; mean age of 49) participated. Construct validation confirmed the LCQ-Br's factorial structure. For concurrent validity, negative correlations were observed between LCQ-Br domains and self-perceived laryngeal sensitivity, cough frequency and intensity, and CSI-Br factors (physical, social, psychological, and total scores). A positive correlation was found between the LCQ-Br total and LHQ-Br scores. Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.952), and test-retest reliability yielded a coefficient of 0.455. The responsiveness analysis demonstrated significant reductions in LCQ-Br scores post-intervention for physical, psychological, and total domains. Conclusion The LCQ-Br is a valid, reliable, and responsive tool for assessing health status in chronic cough patients, making it suitable for clinical practice and research applications.

This defense mechanism is regulated by a complex reflex arc that is activated by the stimulation of specific sensory receptors located in the larynx and upper airways ( 1 ( 2 ( 3 ( 4 When cough persists manifestation for more than 8 weeks, it is categorized as chronic. Chronic cough (CC) is a multifaceted symptom that challenges clinical understanding, requires varied approaches, and can significantly affect patients’ quality of life ( 5 In cases of CC, speech therapy has emerged as a potential treatment option. Despite being a relatively recent area of research, there is already evidence supporting the effectiveness of speech therapy for CC ( 6 8 Among the Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) clinical evaluation procedures for CC, self-assessment of this symptom plays a crucial role. One of the most commonly used instruments for the self-assessment of CC is the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (Leicester Questionnaire on Chronic Cough - LCQ-Br). In the PubMed research platform database, more than 350 references have used LCQ, which shows the wide acceptance and applicability of this instrument in clinical practice and studies related to CC. This extensive use of the LCQ highlights the importance of reliable and validated tools for evaluating the impact of CC on patients’ quality of life. The LCQ has been shown to be the preferred choice among health professionals for this purpose, justifying the need for validation in different linguistic and cultural contexts ( 9 The original version of the LCQ, developed in English by Birring et al. ( 10 The LCQ-Br has already been translated and adapted for Brazilian Portuguese (BP) ( 11 ( 5 The inclusion of a new, validated evaluation instrument represents an advancement for speech therapists and other health professionals in the management of patients with CC. This instrument will improve the ability of professionals to identify the impact of CC and also to intervene effectively in cases of CC, thereby contributing to the well-being and quality of life of individuals with this condition ( 12 Thus, this study aims to validate the Leicester Cough Questionnaire in Brazilian Portuguese. METHODS This cross-sectional study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Protocol 4.789.449). All ethical precepts were complied with in accordance with Brazilian legislation. The study was conducted based on the version of the instrument previously translated and adapted into Brazilian Portuguese. The validation procedures followed the standards defined by the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) ( 13 14 The calculation of the sample size was based on data from a pilot study using the measurements of the first five participants of the experimental group, referring to the Newcastle Laryngeal Hypersensitivity Questionnaire - LHQ-Br ( 15 ( 16 The recruitment of research participants was carried out at the Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho of Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in the Pulmonology and Otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinics. The participants were diagnosed with CC and provided informed consent by signing an Informed Consent Form (ICF). The data were collected at a Speech Therapy Outpatient Clinic. The inclusion criteria were being 18 years or older, having a medical diagnosis of CC, and having BP as their native language. Participants who did not agree to participate in the study by signing the FICF were excluded from the study. Data collection included a sociodemographic questionnaire, LCQ-Br, self-perception of laryngeal sensitivity, cough frequency, cough intensity, the Cough Severity Index - CSI-Br ( 17 ( 15 To analyze the self-perception of laryngeal sensitivity, cough frequency, and cough intensity, a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) was used, in which the participant was instructed to record how they perceived the aforementioned aspects. At the extremities of the VAS, the responses varied between “Adequate” and “Very Sensitive” for laryngeal sensitivity, “Never” and “Always” for cough frequency, and “Adequate” and “Extremely Strong” for cough intensity. The translated and cross-culturally adapted version of the LHQ-Br ( 15 ( 10 11 The CSI-Br consists of ten symptoms related to chronic cough (CC) in different contexts. The patient is instructed to respond to the frequency of these symptoms using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always). The higher the score, the greater the presence of symptoms ( 17 The participants responded to the LCQ-Br on three different occasions: Moment One, called the test; Moment Two, 14 days after Moment One, called the retest; and Moment Three, after the SLP intervention ( 18 The psychometric properties of the LCQ-Br included validity (construct and concurrent criterion validity), reliability (reliability and internal consistency), and responsiveness ( 13 The analysis considered a 95% confidence interval and a significance level of 5%. The statistical software IBM SPSS Statistics 29.0 and IBM SPSS Amos 29.0 were used. The LCQ-Br ( Appendix A ( 19 ( 20 To verify concurrent criterion validity (i.e., the extent to which the questionnaire correlates with other measures based on the same theory and concept), the LCQ-Br was compared with self-perceived laryngeal sensitivity, cough frequency and intensity, CSI-Br ( 17 ( 16 To analyze internal consistency reliability, individuals with CC responded to the instruments once, and their responses were analyzed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Test-retest reliability was calculated to assess the stability of the instrument over time. Two evaluations were carried out at an interval of 14 days, as recommended to prevent significant changes in the evaluated domains ( 21 22 To measure responsiveness, changes in instrument scores were analyzed in relation to changes in the measured construct. Individuals with CC responded to the instrument before and after eight therapy sessions, which were adapted to the individual needs of each participant. The objective was solely to verify whether the instrument could detect changes in the patient's condition resulting from rehabilitation for CC. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the data from the instrument at two evaluation time points. RESULTS The study included 98 patients diagnosed with CC with an average age of 49 years (77 women, 21 men). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) confirmed the factorial structure of the LCQ-Br, maintaining three factors and 19 items: physical (items 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 15), psychological (items 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, and 17), and social (items 7, 8, 18, and 19), as shown in Figure 1 Table 1 Figure 1 Factorial model of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire with three factors and 19 items Caption: So = Social; Ps = Psychological; Ph = Physical Table 1 Measures to adjust the factorial model of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire with three factors and 19 items Model GFI AGFI PGFI NFI RFI PNFI SRMR Default model 0.986 0.982 0.773 0.983 0.980 0.856 0.064 Saturated model 1.000 1.000 0 Independence model 0.171 0.079 0.154 0 0 0 Zero model 0 0 0 Confirmatory factor analysis, unweighted least squares The internal consistency of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire was 0.889 for physical factors, 0.879 for psychological factors, 0.869 for social factors, and 0.952 for the complete instruments ( Table 2 Table 2 Analysis of the reliability by internal consistency of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire Cronbach’s alpha Number of items LCQ-Br Physical 0.889 8 LCQ-Br Psychological 0.879 7 LCQ-Br Social 0.869 4 LCQ-Br Total 0.952 19 Cronbach’s alpha Table 3 Table 3 Reliability analysis by test and retest of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire ICC CI 95% F-test df * Lower limit Upper limit LCQ-Br Physical 0.629 0.230 0.821 2.692 30 0.004 LCQ-Br Psychological 0.414 -0.215 0.718 1.707 30 0.074 LCQ-Br Social 0.332 -0.385 0.678 1.497 30 0.137 LCQ-Br Total 0.455 -0.131 0.737 1.833 30 0.051 Intraclass correlation coefficient Caption: df = degree of freedom; CI = confidence interval; F-test = measures the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance; * p-value = indicates statistical significance (p ≤ .05) The concurrent validity showed a negative and significant correlation of the LCQ-Br physical, psychological, social and total factor, with the self-perception of laryngeal sensitivity (p<0.001; p=0.001; p=0.001; p<0.001, respectively), frequency (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively) and intensity (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively) of cough; with CSI-Br in the CSI-Br factors physical and social activities (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively), CSI-Br Psychological and functional (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively) and in the total score (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively); and, positive correlation with the LHQ-Br (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively), as shown in Table 4 Table 4 Analysis of the criterion validity by concurrent validity of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire LCQ-Br LCQ-Br LCQ-Br LCQ-Br Physical Psychological Social Total Self-perception sensitivity r -.441** -.354** -.348** -.404** p-value 0.000 0.001 0.001 0.000 Frequency of cough r -.693** -.623** -.571** -.676** p-value 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 Cough intensity r -.618** -.630** -.530** -.640** p-value 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 Total CSI-Br r -.817** -.751** -.757** -.827** p-value 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 CSI-Br Physical and social Activities r -.734** -.683** -.734** -.756** p-value 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 CSI-Br Psychological and Functional r -.837** -.748** -.710** -.821** p-value 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 LHQ-Br r .620** .503** .519** .596** p-value 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 Spearman's correlation test Values followed by ** indicate a p-value (probability value) ≤ 0.01, representing highly significant statistical significance.

This instrument, initially developed in the United Kingdom, has proven to be a valuable tool for the evaluation of cough symptoms, offering a detailed perspective on the intensity and impact of cough on patients’ quality of life ( 10 23 The cultural adaptation of the LCQ-Br to BP and its validation are important steps to ensure the applicability and relevance of this questionnaire in a new demographic and cultural context. This validation process strengthens the evidence base for the clinical management of CC in Brazil and contributes to international knowledge about this prevalent condition, which interferes with the health and well-being of the patient ( 9 23 The results of the CFA adjustment indices indicate adequate adjustment of the model to the data. Specifically, indices such as GFI and AGFI close to 1 indicate adequate model fit, whereas a low SRMR value reinforces the adequacy of the data for the proposed model. Such metrics are essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of evaluation tools in clinical and research contexts ( 24 Thus, in BP, the original factorial structure of the LCQ was maintained with three factors: physical, psychological, and social. Each factor had items that reflected the dimensions of the impact of CC on the individuals’ lives. This three-dimensionality favors an integral understanding of CC by associating it with the symptoms and psychological and social effects that often accompany this condition ( 25 26 The identification of the multifactorial nature of CC reaffirms the importance of multidimensional approaches in the treatment of CC. This highlights the need for interventions that are not limited to the relief of physical symptoms but address the psychological aspects that may be impaired in patients with CC ( 27 The availability of a validated instrument like the LCQ-Br facilitates the identification of specific areas of need for each patient, allowing for a personalized and effective approach to the management of CC. As CC is a complex condition, the integration of these aspects into patient care can significantly improve quality of life and treatment outcomes ( 28 The reliability of the instrument was verified through internal consistency, reliability tests, and retests. The results regarding the internal consistency of the LCQ-Br in the Brazilian context demonstrated its robustness and reliability as an evaluation tool. Values above 0.7 are expected, and those obtained in the instrument are higher than 0.85. The high internal consistency of the factors and the total score of the LCQ-Br reaffirm its usefulness in clinical and research contexts, offering a solid basis for future studies on CC and its management ( 28 Analysis of the reliability of the LCQ-Br test-retest suggested little stability of the responses over time. The expected values for this phase were above 0.7, and the physical domain approached this value, whereas the others decreased. The discrepancy in the values may indicate differences in the respondents' perceptions of the severity and impact of CC over time, especially in more subjective and variable aspects, such as emotional and social. Although the coefficient for the complete instrument is below the ideal value, it reflects the complexity and dynamic nature of CC, ratifying the importance of complementary approaches in the evaluation of this condition ( 9 29 Analysis of the concurrent validity of the LCQ-Br revealed negative and significant correlations between the scores of the physical, psychological, social, and total factors of the LCQ-Br and the measures of self-perception of laryngeal sensitivity, frequency, and intensity of the cough, as well as with the scores on the CSI-Br ( 17 A significant positive correlation was observed with the LHQ-Br ( 16 ( 29 30 Analysis of the responsiveness of the LCQ-Br showed a significant decrease in scores after the intervention, covering the physical, and psychological domains in addition to the total score. These results indicate that this is a sensitive tool for detecting clinical changes in the construct after treatment. The ability of the LCQ-Br to capture these changes confirms its practical value as an evaluation tool, allowing health professionals to monitor the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions and adjust treatment strategies based on patient responses. Therefore, the significant reduction in scores reinforces the usefulness of the questionnaire not only for the initial evaluation of patients but also as a reliable indicator of clinical progress and improvement of cough-related quality of life ( 27 28 30 Appendix B CONCLUSION Validation of the LCQ-Br in the Brazilian context confirmed its position as an effective tool for diagnosing and monitoring CC. The LCQ-Br proved to be a valid and responsive instrument for obtaining information on the various effects of CC on patients' daily lives. The questionnaire's responsiveness after therapeutic interventions emphasizes its clinical and research utility, allowing for effective monitoring of treatment outcomes and adaptation of CC management strategies. The implementation of the LCQ-Br as a standard evaluation tool for patients diagnosed with CC can facilitate a personalized treatment approach, contributing to an improved quality of life for patients. Thus, the LCQ-Br is a valuable instrument for understanding and managing CC, supporting both clinical practice and research in this field.
