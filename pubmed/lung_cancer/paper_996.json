During the preoperative period, patients often face functional decline, malnutrition, and psychological stress, which can impair recovery. Prehabilitation, a multidisciplinary preoperative intervention, shows promise in optimizing patients' physical and mental status. AIM To evaluate the impact of prehabilitation on patients undergoing UGIC surgery and provide a basis for implementation of the prehabilitation compound plan. METHODS A computerized search of databases including Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database was used to collect clinical trials on the impact of prehabilitation on patients undergoing UGIC surgery. After screening, a meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.0 software, and linear regression analysis was performed on the prehabilitation duration and outcome indicators. RESULTS A total of 13 clinical trials were ultimately included, with 8 literature quality evaluations at A level and 5 literature quality evaluations at B level. The meta-analysis results showed that compared with conventional nursing, the prehabilitation group had higher six-minute walk distance, lower postoperative complications and mortality rates, and shorter hospital stays, with statistically significant differences; there were no statistically significant differences in intensive care unit monitoring time and albumin levels between the two groups; regression analysis between prehabilitation duration and outcome indicators showed no significant relationship. CONCLUSION Prehabilitation can improve the perioperative functional ability of patients with UGIC and promote postoperative recovery, but its impact on nutrition, psychology, and quality of life needs to be further explored through more high-quality trials; in addition, further research is needed on the prehabilitation time, location, and specific plan.

In 2020, the incidence and mortality rates of esophageal and gastric cancer were among the top ten globally and in China, imposing significant medical and economic burdens on society and families[ 1 3 4 6 7 8 In recent years, prehabilitation - defined as a series of interventions implemented before surgery, including exercise, nutritional support, and psychological counseling - has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing surgical readiness and promoting recovery[ 9 10 10 11 12 This study aims to conduct a meta-analysis of published clinical trials examining the effects of prehabilitation on UGIC surgical patients. By evaluating outcome indicators such as six-minute walk distance (6MWD), complication rate, hospital stay duration, intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring time, mortality, and nutritional status, we hope to provide robust evidence to guide clinical implementation of prehabilitation protocols in this high-risk patient group. MATERIALS AND METHODS Literature search strategy A comprehensive computerized search was performed across multiple databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Chinese Science and Technology Journal Database, to identify clinical trials investigating the effects of prehabilitation in patients with UGIC. The search covered all records available from the inception of each database up to December 31, 2022. In English-language databases, the search strategy included the following keyword combinations: (1) Upper gastrointestinal, esophageal, esophagus, esophagogastric, gastric, stomach, duodenal, duodenum; (2) Cancer, neoplasms, carcinoma, tumor, malignancies; and (3) Prehabilitation, pre-rehabilitation, preoperative, perioperative care. The final search string was constructed as: (1), (2), and (3). For Chinese-language databases, equivalent and context-appropriate Chinese search terms were used. Selection criteria  Inclusion criteria:  Exclusion criteria: Literature screening and data extraction This study involved two researchers independently screening the literature, extracting data, and cross-checking. Discrepancies in literature evaluation were resolved through discussion, third-party consultation, or by emailing the original authors. For literature screening, non-clinical trial literature was excluded based on Medical Subject Headings terms and search strategy. Initially, titles were read for preliminary screening to exclude irrelevant literature. Abstracts and full texts were further reviewed for final inclusion. If necessary, study authors were contacted via etc Bias risk assessment in included studies Two researchers independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies and cross-checked the results. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Australian JBI tools for intervention studies randomized controlled trials (RCTs)[ 13 14 Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3. For continuous outcomes, mean difference (MD) was used as the effect measure; for dichotomous outcomes, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ 2 I 2 I 2 I 2 RESULTS Literature screening process and results A total of 4519 potentially relevant articles were initially identified through database searches. After a rigorous, multi-step screening process, 13 studies encompassing 1322 patients met the inclusion criteria and were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. Among them, 8 were RCTs[ 10 11 15 21 22 26 1 1 1 Figure 1  Literature screening flowchart. Table 1 Basic characteristics of the included studies  Ref.

DISCUSSION This study conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of prehabilitation on perioperative outcomes in patients who underwent UGIC surgery. The findings suggest that prehabilitation significantly improves pre- and postoperative functional status, reduces postoperative complications and 30-day mortality, and shortens hospital stay, thereby has substantial clinical value. However, its effects on ICU stay, nutritional status, psychological outcomes, and quality of life (QoL) remain inconclusive and require further analysis considering study heterogeneity and methodological variation. Prehabilitation enhances physical reserves and postoperative resilience by integrating planned exercise training, nutritional support, and psychological interventions. Our findings indicate that patients in the prehabilitation group had significantly greater 6MWD both before and after surgery compared to controls, demonstrating a clear functional benefit. These results align with previous studies by Piraux et al 27 et al 28 Although the overall effect on ICU length of stay was not significant, subgroup analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in ICU stay among Asian populations, but not in European cohorts. These regional differences may be related to disparities in adherence, intervention intensity, or ICU management practices. Given the limited number of studies and the high heterogeneity ( I 2 Prehabilitation showed a trend toward improved preoperative nutritional status but did not significantly affect postoperative ALB levels, which showed high heterogeneity ( I 2 29 30 Although some studies, such as the study by Allen et al 10 e.g. 23 31 The duration of prehabilitation ranged from 1 week to 4 weeks, with interventions conducted at home or in hospitals and utilizing either single- or multi-modal strategies. Linear regression found no significant association between duration and outcomes, suggesting that the implementation of prehabilitation itself may be more important than the exact length of intervention. In China, short preoperative hospitalization and patient reluctance to delay surgery-especially in rural populations-pose practical challenges[ 28 32 33 The ERAS guidelines, including the 2021 Chinese edition, recommend multimodal prehabilitation combining exercise, nutrition, and psychological support[ 12 34 The included studies had diverse surgical backgrounds, tumor stages, and histories of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although all followed guidelines for perioperative care, baseline consistency is unclear. The patient populations, tumor characteristics, and intervention modalities varied significantly among studies, contributing to notable clinical heterogeneity and limiting the consistency and generalizability of the findings. Despite our attempt to perform subgroup analyses based on tumor stage, surgical methods, and types of prehabilitation interventions, these efforts were hindered by insufficient and inconsistent reporting in the included studies. Most studies did not provide detailed stratification information, making subgroup comparisons infeasible. Additionally, there were differences in the evaluation indicators among the studies, and inconsistent use of outcome metrics further limited data comparability. The methodologies of the included studies were not always clearly described. Despite attempts to contact original authors via These limitations may affect the internal and external validity of the study findings. For instance, unclear intervention protocols or outcome definitions in original studies could introduce selection and measurement bias, while heterogeneity in patient populations may limit the generalizability of the conclusions to broader clinical settings. Moreover, potential publication bias and the absence of long-term outcome data constrain the ability to assess the durability of prehabilitation benefits. Therefore, further high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our findings. Given the limitations identified in this meta-analysis, future research should aim to establish standardized, multimodal prehabilitation protocols tailored to UGIC patients. High-quality, multicenter RCTs are needed to determine the most effective timing and components of prehabilitation. In addition, more robust tools and unified outcome measures should be developed to assess the psychological and QoL effects of prehabilitation, which remain insufficiently explored. Studies focusing on home-based vs CONCLUSION Prehabilitation management in UGIC patients has high applicability for improving preoperative functional reserves and promoting postoperative recovery. This study indicates that the impact of prehabilitation on nutrition, psychology, and QoL requires further research. Future studies should consider incorporating validated and sensitive tools for nutritional assessment ( e.g. e.g.  Conflict-of-interest statement:  PRISMA 2009 Checklist statement:  Provenance and
