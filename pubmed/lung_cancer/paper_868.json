Highlights • PDOs showed heterogeneous radiation response, reflecting the clinical situation. • Radiosensitive PDOs showed increased DNA damage, proliferation and reduced hypoxia. • GSEA revealed upregulated OXPHOS-related pathways in the radioresistant subgroup. • Radioresistance of PDOs correlated with poorer outcome of the patient. • PDOs enable insight into radioresistance and identification of novel targets. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies with neoadjuvant radio(chemo)therapy failing in approximately 70 % of cases due to high tumor heterogeneity, and intrinsic radioresistance. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) closely recapitulate appearance, and functionality as the original tissue and have potential to explore novel therapies for personalized radiooncology. In this study, the radioresponse of PDAC PDO lines was determined after irradiation (RT). PDOs were immunohistochemically characterized by γ-H2AX, HIF-1α and Ki-67 staining. RNA sequencing data were analyzed by gene set enrichment analyses to investigate underlying mechanisms of radioresistance. Preclinical findings were correlated with clinical data from the corresponding patients. PDOs showed a significant heterogeneity in response to radiation and were classified into radiosensitive, intermediate, and radioresistant subgroups. A correlation between radiosensitivity and enhanced proliferation and decreased hypoxia was observed. OXPHOS-related gene signatures were significantly overexpressed in the radioresistant phenotype. Translationally, radioresistance in PDOs was associated with significantly poorer survival of patients. Our platform demonstrated heterogeneity in radioresponse reflecting the clinical situation and correlation with clinical outcomes. Immunohistochemical staining and transcriptomic profiling identified molecular signatures, including HIF-1α and OXPHOS-related pathways, associated with radioresistance. Implementing PDO-based radioresponse profiling in clinical workflows may enable patient stratified treatment approaches. Overall, our findings suggest that functionalizing PDOs for radioresponse might extend PDO-informed precision oncology.

Its incidence is rising, and PDAC is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death within the next decade. Despite intense efforts in basic research and the development of novel treatment strategies, the prognosis remains dismal, with a 5-year survival rate below 10 % [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Most preclinical models rely on conventional 2D cell lines cultured on plastic dishes due to ease of use, broad availability and minimal cost [ 13 14 15 13 16 PDO-based RT platforms exist for several cancers, most notably colorectal cancer, where Hsu et al. demonstrated dose-response profiling, genetic radiosensitivity correlates, and clinical validation [ 17 In this project, we employed a radiobiological platform using clinically annotated PDAC PDOs to characterize radiation response. Specifically, we analyzed radiation response and radiobiological features including DNA-damage, proliferation and hypoxia as well as differentially regulated gene expression signatures across a panel of PDO lines. In order to underscore the clinical relevance of our translational PDAC platform in radiation oncology, novel targets for radioresistance were revealed, and clinical data of the respective PDAC patients were correlated with experimental results. Materials and methods Study approval This preclinical study was complemented by a retrospective analysis of clinical data. The collection and use of PDOs were approved by the ethics committee of the Technical University Munich (TUM) (protocol code 373/20 S-EB from 13 July 2020). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to sample acquisition. Clinical data was collected retrospectively using the clinical workstation system at the TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar. Generation and cultivation of PDOs Tumor specimens were obtained either by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy (Medical Clinic and Polyclinic II) or surgical resection (Department of Surgery) at TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar between 2019 and 2020. PDOs were generated in Patient-derived Organoid Unit within the Translational Pancreatic Cancer Research Center, Medical Clinic and Polyclinic II at TUM. Except one sample (B211) the PDOs were isolated from chemo-naïve tumor tissue. PDAC was diagnosed by a board-certified pathologist in all cases. PDOs were generated and cultured following the protocol by Dantes et al. [ 16 18 19 L d l Irradiation Radiation was delivered at 200 kV and 15 mA with a dose rate of 0.90 Gy/min using the RS225A RT device (Gulmay/Xstrahl). Cell viability assay and microscopic analysis after RT Response to RT was determined using the CellTiter-Glo (CTG) 3D Cell Viability Assay (Promega). PDOs were enzymatically dissociated with TrypLE (Express Enzyme 1x, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and seeded. After 24 h of incubation for organoid reassembly, cells were irradiated with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 Gy. Depending on the experiment, cells were incubated for an additional 72 h or one week followed by microscopic analysis and CTG viability assay. Brightfield microscopic images were obtained prior to cell lysis using Primovert microscope and Axiocam ERc 5 s (Carl Zeiss). Organoid area was measured in the software “QuPath” (The University of Edinburgh); for each condition, 15 representative organoids per each replicate were analyzed. CTG reagent was added at a 1:1 ratio. Plates were shaken for 10 min and incubated at room temperature for 20 min before luminescence was measured with a spectrophotometer (Varioskan LUX, Thermo-Fisher). Based on the radiation response at 8 Gy, PDOs were classified into three subgroups. Immunohistochemistry For radiobiological characterization, PDOs were incubated for one week, and then irradiated with 0 Gy, 4 Gy or 8 Gy. PDOs were fixed 1 h after RT for γ-H2AX staining (Phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139) (20E3) Rabbit mAb, Cell Signaling Technology) and 24 h after RT for Ki-67 (Recombinant Anti-Ki67 antibody [SP6], Abcam) and HIF-1α (HIF-1α Antibody, Novus Biologicals). In addition, slices were stained for hematoxylin (Mayer’s hematoxylin) and eosin (eosin y-solution 0.5 % aqueous) (HE). At the respective times PDOs were fixed in 4 % formalin for 2 h, transferred to 70 % ethanol, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned (2 µm). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using the automated BOND RX staining system (Leica Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Slides were digitized using “Aperio AT2” slide scanner and analyzed quantitatively with “ImageScope” (Leica Biosystems) and “QuPath”. For γ-H2AX and Ki-67, positive nuclei were quantified using the “positive cell detection” tool (based on optical density sum). HIF-1α-positive cells were identified by a manually trained multivariable random tree classifier. Analysis of PDO gene expression data RNA-seq data were obtained from untreated PDOs, all processed within the same analysis batch. B169 was excluded due to batch variation, and no RNA-seq data were available for B326. Genome-wide differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 R package [ 20 For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), class-specific gene expression signatures were generated by comparing each radiosensitivity group (e.g., resistant vs. rest) using DESeq2. These radiosensitivity-specific gene expression signatures (GES) were represented by Wald test statistics per gene and were interrogated by GSEA [ 21 22 For individual contrasts (e.g., resistant vs. sensitive), Wald statistic-based signatures were interrogated using both HALLMARK and PDAC subtype-specific gene sets (top 100 genes of basal-like and classical subtypes from Moffitt et al. [ 23 24 To identify transcriptomic correlates of radiosensitivity without predefined subgroups, genome-wide Pearson correlations were calculated between log2-transformed gene expression and 8 Gy post-irradiation viability (day 7). Positive correlations indicate higher expression in resistant PDOs, negative in sensitive ones. Empirical p-values were obtained from 10,000 permutations and cross-checked with subgroup-based differential expression (R v2025.05.1 + 513). Correlation with clinical data Clinical data of the corresponding PDOs were collected retrospectively, including age at diagnosis, sex, tumor stage (UICC, Union for International Cancer Control), initial serum markers CA-19.9 and CEA, treatment (neoadjuvant/adjuvant CT, surgery), and outcome (distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and OS). Preclinical subgroups, defined by relative cell viability after 8 Gy RT, were compared and correlated with clinical parameters. Statistics and reproducibility Cell viability assays were performed in ≥ 3 independent experiments with 5 replicates per dose. Effects of RT on cell viability, PDO area and expression of the different IHC markers as well as on clinical data were analyzed using two-sided t Dose–response data were fitted with a linear-quadratic (LQ) model (SF = exp[-α·D - β·D²]) normalized to non-irradiated controls (SF=1 at 0 Gy), with α≥0 and β≥0. Model quality was assessed via R², AICc, and residuals. Curves were also fitted with the single-hit multi-target (SHMT) model [ 25 n n For three-group comparisons, variance homogeneity was assessed with the Brown–Forsythe test; if violated ( p 2 25 n n Prognostic relevance for OS was evaluated with Cox regression (8 Gy viability, z-standardized) with proportional hazards assumptions tested with Schoenfeld residuals, and model fit by Wald and likelihood ratio tests (R 2025.05.1 + 513). Analyses and plotting were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1. (GraphPad Software, Inc). P Results Heterogeneity of radiation response To assess radioresponse in PDOs, viability assays and microscopic analysis were performed on a panel of nine PDO lines one week ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Cell viability and organoid area (normalized to the respective 0 Gy control). Colors indicate radiosensitivity subgroups defined in the Results (green: radiosensitive, blue: intermediate, red: radioresistant). A) Relative cell viability of nine PDO lines, determined by CTG assay, one week after RT with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Gy. Data represent at least three independent experiments. B) Comparison of the relative cell viability at 8 Gy across the nine PDO lines, grouped by radiosensitivity (sensitive, intermediate, resistant). Welch’s ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons test revealed significant differences between resistant vs. sensitive (p = 0.0001) and resistant vs. intermediate PDOs (p = 0.0017), but not between sensitive vs. intermediate PDOs (p = 0.0924; Supplementary Fig. S2C). C) Comparison of relative mean organoid area one week after 8 Gy RT. Ordinary one-way ANOVA (Brown–Forsythe p = 0.8735, indicating homogeneous variances) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test showed no significant differences among the three subgroups (ANOVA: F(2,20) = 1.185, p = 0.3263; pairwise comparisons: sensitive vs. intermediate p = 0.9707; sensitive vs. resistant p = 0.3360; intermediate vs. resistant p = 0.4277). D) Correlation between relative cell viability and mean organoid area at 8 Gy (p = 0.0686, Pearson’s R = 0.6307). Fig 1: Based on relative viability at 8 Gy one week after irradiation, PDO lines were stratified into radiosensitive (B283, B211, B326), intermediate (B169, B188, B290) and radioresistant (B320, B339, B226) groups. This classification was applied in an exploratory manner to contrast the most sensitive with the most resistant PDOs, while the intermediate group served as a transition category. Although viability values suggested a continuous distribution of radioresistance, this subgrouping facilitated the structured presentation of subsequent biological comparisons. LQ modelling yielded α/β parameters broadly consistent with the 8 Gy-based subgroups, particularly in resistant PDOs, but with overlaps between sensitive and intermediate lines. Poor fit quality and unstable β estimates supported 8 Gy viability as the more robust endpoint (supplementary Table S2). Analysis with the SHMT model provided D₀, n, and Dq values (supplementary Table S2). Resistant PDOs showed high D₀ and in some cases broad shoulders, while sensitive PDOs had low D₀ and narrow shoulders. Intermediate lines again overlapped with sensitive PDOs, consistent with a continuum of radiosensitivity. However, low R² in several resistant PDOs highlighted the limited stability of SHMT fits in shallow survival curves. Welch’s ANOVA with Dunnett’s T3 post-hoc test showed significant viability differences at 8 Gy between resistant and sensitive ( p p p Fig. 1 p Fig. 1 p R Fig. 1 Taken together, our optimized experimental setup showed a significant heterogeneity in radioresponse with significant subgroup differences in cell viability one week after RT in our panel of nine PDO lines but not in organoid area. Radiobiological characterization by immunohistochemistry As surrogate of DNA damage, we determined baseline and radiation induced γ-H2AX staining ( Fig. 2 p p p p p p p p p Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Percentage of positive cells for γ‑H2AX (A1, 1 h), Ki‑67 (B1, 24 h), and HIF‑1α (C1, 24 h) after RT with 0, 4, or 8 Gy in the sensitive (B283, B211, B326), intermediate (B169, B188, B290), and resistant (B320, B339, B226) subgroup. A1) γ‑H2AX: No significant baseline differences were observed among the three subgroups (one-way ANOVA p = 0.82; Tukey’s post-hoc: sensitive vs. intermediate p = 0.897; sensitive vs. resistant p = 0.814; intermediate vs. resistant p = 0.984). One hour after RT, γ‑H2AX levels increased significantly (Brown–Forsythe p = 0.0003; Welch’s ANOVA p = 0.0017). Dunnett’s T3 post-hoc analysis confirmed significant increases from 0 Gy (38.6 %) to 4 Gy (87.7 %, p = 0.0036) and 8 Gy (89.5 %, p = 0.0040), with no difference between 4 Gy and 8 Gy (p = 0.95). At 4 Gy, subgroup differences were not significant (ANOVA p = 0.1421). At 8 Gy, ANOVA showed significant differences (p = 0.0013), with radiosensitive PDOs exhibiting higher γ‑H2AX levels than intermediate (96.34 % vs. 85.46 %, p = 0.0017) and resistant lines (96.34 % vs. 86.68 %, p = 0.0032), while intermediate and resistant PDOs did not differ (p = 0.7650). B1) Ki‑67: Radiosensitive PDOs showed significantly higher baseline expression compared to the combined intermediate and resistant groups (60.7 % vs. 34.7 %; F-test p = 0.2104; unpaired two-tailed t Fig 2: Proliferative activity was evaluated by Ki-67 staining at baseline and 24 h after RT ( Fig. 2 p Fig. 2 Hypoxia was analyzed by HIF-1α staining ( Fig. 2 p Fig. 2 In summary, the IHC staining (subgroup-specific quantification in supplementary Table S3) revealed significant decreased DNA-damage one hour after RT, decreased baseline proliferation, and increased baseline hypoxia in radioresistant PDO lines - suggesting potential mechanisms of intrinsic radioresistance. Gene expression signatures associated with radioresistance Unbiased correlation analysis of gene expression with radiosensitivity (8 Gy viability) showed strong concordance with the subgroup-based differential expression analysis, with consistent gene overlap and directionality ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between radioresistant and radiosensitive PDO subgroups, colored according to their correlation with radiosensitivity (8 Gy post-irradiation viability). Each dot represents a single gene. The x-axis shows the log₂ fold change (resistant minus sensitive), and the y-axis shows the –log₁₀ p-value from the subgroup-based differential expression analysis. Genes positively correlated with viability (red) are predominantly upregulated in radioresistant PDOs, whereas genes negatively correlated (green) are upregulated in radiosensitive PDOs, confirming concordance between subgroup-based and correlation-based analyses. Fig 3: The radiosensitive subgroup showed significant upregulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature compared to both the resistant (NES:2.06, p adj p adj In contrast, the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway was enriched in the radioresistant subgroup, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial respiration and oxygen-dependent metabolism ( Fig. 4 26 Fig. 4 A) GSEA of the radioresistant subgroup for OXPHOS dependent genes shows a significant upregulation of involved genes in comparison to the two other subgroups (NES 8.57, p Fig 4: Further GSEA using PDAC subtype-specific gene sets [ 23 p adj −11 adj −7 Fig. 4 In summary, transcriptomic profiling identified subtype-specific expression differences, with OXPHOS activation and “classical” subtype enrichment as potential features of radioresistant PDOs and confirmed that these patterns are robust when radiosensitivity is treated as a continuous variable. Explorative correlation of preclinical results with patient data for translational research To bridge gaps between the radiobiological characterization of PDOs and the clinical relevance of our translational PDO model, clinical data of the respective PDAC patients were correlated with our experimental data. Patient characteristics including age at time point of diagnosis, sex, UICC tumor stage, baseline CA19–9 and CEA levels, treatment details, and outcomes (DMFS, OS), are summarized in Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics including age, sex, tumor stage, initial serum level of the tumor markers CA19–9 and CEA, treatment and clinical outcome.

Higher viability was associated with increased hazard of death (HR per 1 SD = 4.92; 95 % CI 1.06–22.86; Wald p p p in vitro p R Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Relationship between mean overall survival (OS) and in vitro n r p in vitro Fig 5: Taken together, OS and clinical outcome was significantly worse in our radioresistant PDO subgroup , Discussion In this work, we established a preclinical setup to determine the radioresponse and the radiobiological characteristics of a PDO biobank. The response to RT in nine PDO-lines showed a high heterogeneity, and radiosensitive, intermediate and -resistant subgroups were identified, after optimizing the experimental design with the one-week time point after RT for readout. This offers the chance to integrate the in vitro PDAC PDOs provide the opportunity to evaluate new treatment options and to tailor the optimal personalized therapy for patients, as their genomic profile is equivalent to the individual patient’s genomic heterogeneity [ 27 in vitro 28 The use of PDAC PDOs to investigate the efficacy of RT is not well researched and implemented in the clinic yet compared to other tumor entities or treatment modalities. Important first experiments evaluating the effects of RT in four different PDAC PDO lines were published by Naumann et al. [ 29 29 In contrast, our use of an ATP-based assay with a later readout (one-week post-RT) enabled more reliable detection of interline differences. This is consistent with the work of van Goor et al. using ATP-based assays in two PDAC PDO lines, which similarly concluded that extended observation periods are necessary to uncover relevant dose-response patterns [ 30 Similarly, Yao et al. demonstrated that heterogeneity in cell viability persisted 15 days after RT in a cohort of 80 rectal cancer PDOs used to predict response to chemoradiation [ 31 These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate time points and viability assays after RT to reliably capture biologically and clinically relevant differences. The advantage and innovation of our current study lie in the broader screening of nine PDAC PDO lines, the additional in-depth radiobiological characterization including assessment of DNA damage, hypoxia, and proliferation by IHC, and most importantly the correlation of in vitro Radiosensitivity parameters from LQ and SHMT modelling broadly aligned with the 8 Gy-based classification at the extremes, but flat curves and unstable fits limited their utility in this small cohort. In contrast, 8 Gy viability was robust, measurable in all PDOs, and avoided uncertainties from extrapolation. The classification was applied exploratively to enable structured comparisons, with the intermediate category reducing misclassification near cutoffs and reflecting the continuous distribution of radiosensitivity. To investigate radiobiological mechanisms, PDOs were stained for γ-H2AX, Ki-67, and HIF-1α at baseline and after RT. γ-H2AX staining reflected radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Baseline differences were not significant, indicating that increases at 4 Gy and 8 Gy were irradiation-related. Radiosensitive PDOs showed significantly higher γ-H2AX levels after RT than resistant lines, consistent with greater DNA damage susceptibility and contributing to their higher radiosensitivity [ 32 Ki-67 is a protein detectable in proliferating cells only [ 33 34 35 36 37 In contrast, no consistent changes in Ki-67 were observed 24 h after irradiation in any subgroup, suggesting either absence of immediate proliferative arrest or that effects such as mitotic catastrophe occur later. Additional time points beyond 24 h could help to clarify the temporal dynamics of proliferation after RT, but were outside the scope of the present study and should be addressed in future work. Nevertheless, these findings support the potential of Ki-67 as a prognostic marker for radiosensitivity in PDAC. HIF-1α is a subunit of a transcription factor, which is upregulated among other reasons as a response to hypoxia [ 38 39 40 We assume that by combining these three markers (γ-H2AX, Ki-67 and HIF-1α), IHC could provide a strong tool for the radiobiological characterization and prediction of radioresponse. In our work, the comparison of the two PDO lines B188 and B211 is of particular note, because these specimens are derived from the same patient before (B188) and after (B211) neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFIRINOX. Our results showed an increased response to RT of B211 compared to B188. As an induction CT has the potential to change the genetic profile of tumors, RT might be a promising second therapeutic option for locally advanced PDAC as recommended in international guidelines. These results require confirmation by further pairs of PDOs generated before and after CT. The rapid availability of the RNA-seq data enables fast decision-making in the clinical routine in the best interest of the patient. OXPHOS is beside glycolysis the cells main source of ATP. OXPHOS is carried out in the mitochondria, with the need of oxygen as terminal electron acceptor. Despite hypoxic conditions in many cancer entities, the upregulation of glycolysis to comply with the extensive need for energy (Warburg-effect) is not accompanied with a downregulation of OXPHOS [ 41 42 43 Transcriptomic differences between radiosensitive and radioresistant PDOs remained consistent when radiosensitivity was analyzed as a continuous variable, supporting their robustness and indicating genuine biological rather than classification-derived effects. The prospective COMPASS trial demonstrated the feasibility of predictive mutational signatures in advanced PDAC, showing better response to mFOLFIRINOX in patients with the “classical” than the “basal-like” subtype [ 44 45 Hsu et al. demonstrated in rectal cancer that PDOs can predict radiosensitivity by integrating mutational profiling, dose-response modeling, and mechanistic assays with clinical outcomes [ 17 Furthermore, the only primary metastasized UICC tumor stage IV as well as unresectable diseases were observed in the radioresistant subgroup. The other parameters like age at diagnosis, sex or initial level of common tumor markers CA19–9 and CEA did not show any correlation with the preclinical results. Although the data set is rather small, we demonstrated a trend towards worse survival and clinically more aggressiveness in the radioresistant subgroup. Limitations of our study arise from the small sample size as well as from the clinical heterogeneity regarding specimen origin, and treatment. Another limiting factor is the missing of stromal components in the TME of the PDOs. PDAC is known to feature an intratumoral heterogeneity on transcriptional level in different areas of the primary side [ 46 in vitro To our knowledge, we were the first to develop a PDAC PDO-based platform to investigate the response to RT as well as the radiobiological characteristics and the correlation of preclinical with corresponding clinical data for implementation of real translational research. Conclusion Our translational platform using PDAC PDOs enabled characterization of the radiation response, identification of radiobiological features, and detection of radioresistance patterns, suggesting a predictive potential for personalized therapeutic approaches in radiation oncology. The high heterogeneity among PDOs in response to RT reflect the clinical situation. We gained insights into key mechanisms of radioresistance and revealed hypoxia as a potential driver of radioresistance in our cohort. Moreover, OXPHOS pathway activation emerged as a promising target for radiosensitization.
