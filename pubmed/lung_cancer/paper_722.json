We evaluated the effects of hypoxia on the growth, cell cycle, redox status, and antioxidant enzyme activity of the A549 cells. Since oxygen consumption, energy demand, and redox status are closely related, we also analyzed identify the differentially expressed genes related to hypoxia response. We conducted transcriptomic analysis on A549 cells grown under normoxia-hypoxia cycles and on samples from hypoxic lung adenocarcinoma patients. Transient hypoxia response refers to the cellular response of cells to a temporary decrease in the availability of oxygen. Under conditions of hypoxia, cells undergo a series of physiological changes that allow them to adapt and survive. This response is controlled by a complex network of signaling pathways and transcription factors, including the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, which plays a central role in mediating the cellular response to hypoxia. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the transient hypoxia response in A549 cells can provide insights into the biology of lung cancer and may help to develop new strategies for the treatment of this disease. The study of the response of A549 lung cancer cells to hypoxia is crucial for improving our understanding of the complex interactions between cancer cells and the microenvironment and for developing more effective strategies for the treatment of lung cancer. The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the response of cancer cells to hypoxia and may provide insights into the development of more effective therapies for the treatment of lung cancer. Our results showed that alterations in hypoxia-induced redox parameters and cell cycle patterns are temporary and can be restored by returning to normoxic conditions. Additionally, the findings of this study may provide clue for the development of new strategies for reducing the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as for enhancing the efficacy of these treatments. Materials and methods Chemicals Consumable for cell culture such as Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), trypsin, antibiotics, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Hi-Media (Hi-Media Pvt., Mumbai, India). Hoechst 33342, and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) was procured from Molecular Probes (NY, USA).

This assay measures the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which are an indicator of cellular viability. For MTT assay, 5 × 10 3 9 3 Measurement of cell cycle For studying the effect of hypoxia, 5 × 10 3 Measurement of cellular redox status For detecting intracellular and mitochondrial ROS, we have used carboxy-H2DCFDA and MitoSOX-Red dye, respectively [ 14 14 We have also estimated the glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) activities in the cells grown under normoxia and hypoxia using standard laboratory protocols [ 14 3 2 2 Transient effect of hypoxia on A549 cells To confirm whether the effect of hypoxia is transient or permanent, a reciprocal exposure experiment was performed. For this 3 × 10 3 Analysis of gene expression in response to hypoxia exposure To determine the effect of hypoxia on differential gene expression pattern in human lung adenocarcinoma cells cultured under normoxia and hypoxia, the raw data were downloaded from the GEO database (Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array in.CEL format) and was analyzed using Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC, AppliedBiosystems), which performs the normalization of signal intensity, quality control, and statistical analysis.

Data were analyzed using KyPlot 5 statistical software (KyensLab Inc, Japan). The data obtained from the cell viability and cell proliferation assays, the cell cycle, redox status apoptosis assay, and the cell proliferation assay were analyzed using multiple comparison analysis followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. Data are representative of two to three independent experiments, each perform with multiple replicates. The number of sample (n) for each experimental group is given in the figure legends). Statistical significance was set at * p p p p Results Changes in cell viability and proliferation in response to hypoxia To study the effect of hypoxia on A549 cell viability, proliferation and cell cycle MTT assay, CFSE dye dilution and propidium iodide staining was performed, respectively. Our results showed that after hypoxic treatment, there was more than 50% decrease in the cell proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells compared to the normoxia control cells. The results of MTT, nuclei counting and CFSE dye dilution indicate that A549 cells incubated under the hypoxic conditions for 72 h have divided less as compared to normoxic conditions (Fig. 1 1 1 Fig. 1 Hypoxia inhibits proliferation and induces G1 phase arrest in A549 lung cancer cells. A C A B C D A B C D p Hypoxia modifies the cellular redox status in the A549 cells To study the effect of hypoxia on cell proliferation, cell division, and cell cycle in A549 cells, cellular and mitochondrial ROS, as well as total thiol content was measured. It was observed that there were more than 2.64-fold increases in cellular ROS levels in hypoxia as compared to normoxia which indicated that the cells were under oxidative stress (Fig. 2 2 2 Fig. 2 Hypoxia induces oxidative stress in A549 cells by elevating ROS levels and reducing antioxidant enzyme activity. A B C D E F i iii B D E E p p p p After studying the cellular redox in hypoxia, it was important to study the enzymes involved during oxidative stress. In this study, we have assayed the activity of GR, GPx, and GST. These enzymes play important roles in cellular redox and antioxidant systems. Our study shows that the activities of GR, GPx, and GST under hypoxia were much lower than the normoxia (Fig. 2 The response of hypoxia is temporary To find out whether the effect of hypoxia on cell proliferation and cell division is transient or permanent, a reciprocal exposure experiment was carried out. From Fig. 3 3 3 Fig. 3 Reciprocal exposure experiment to determine the reversibility of hypoxia-induced effects on cell proliferation. A B B p p Identification of differentially expressed genes in response to hypoxia Transcriptomic profiling of A549 cells under hypoxic conditions To explore the mechanism of the observed hypoxia response in the culture conditions, the study was further extended towards transcriptome profiling of the A549 cells grown in the hypoxic conditions. We examined the differential gene expression in A549 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions. The gene expression analysis revealed several genes that were differentially expressed in response to hypoxia. Our differential gene expression analysis indicate that out of 3356 differentially expressed genes majority of genes (2217) were downregulated (Fig. 4 4 Fig. 4 Transcriptomic profiling of A549 cells under hypoxic conditions and it validation by RT-PCR. A B C D D Some of the energy metabolism genes were down-regulated under hypoxia includes pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) having a fold change of 18, 12.4, and 11, respectively, and were involved in Krebs’s cycle and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Interestingly, hexokinase 2 (HK2), aldolase C (ALDOC), and enolase 2 (ENO2) that are involved in energy metabolism were upregulated having a fold change value 12, 11.25 and 6.2, respectively, and were involved in the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is one of the crucial genes involved in the nucleotide metabolism was 10.5-fold down-regulated under hypoxia condition. Several of the genes which were related to cellular redox homeostasis such as glutamate-cysteine ligase-modifier subunit (GCLM), thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (NQO1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase-catalytic subunit (GCLC) were 9.6-, 8, 7-, and 5.8-fold down-regulated, respectively. These transcriptomic observations clearly indicate that the majority of genes down-regulated under hypoxia conditions were involved in various vital pathways such as energy metabolism, DNA replication, cell cycle, and Nrf2 pathway which are very closely related to cell cycle arrest and increased oxidative stress (Supplementary Fig. 1A–D). To validate the findings from our analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data ( GSE48134 2 4 4 Transcriptomic profiling of A549 cells under cyclic hypoxic conditions Further, to examine the transient effect of hypoxia, another set of transcriptome analysis was performed in which one set of A549 cells was cultured under cyclic hypoxia apart from hypoxia and normoxia condition. This transcriptomic analysis data shows that there was a large number of the differentially expressed genes in hypoxia conditions compared with either normoxia or cyclic hypoxia (Supplementary Table 2). But there was significantly no difference in the differentially expressed genes between the normoxia and cyclic hypoxia group (Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Transcriptomic profiling of A549 cells under normoxia, hypoxia, and cyclic hypoxia conditions. A B Transcriptomic profiling of lung adenocarcinoma tissues Both of the previously analyzed data sets were from the A549 cells cultured either in hypoxia or cyclic hypoxia. So next data set in which analysis was performed was a lung adenocarcinoma tissues isolated from the patients and cultured under normoxia and hypoxia conditions (GEO database: GSE30979 6 Fig. 6 Transcriptomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma tissues under normoxia and hypoxia. A B Discussion Hypoxia has been shown to suppress the proliferation of various cell types and a broad range of cancer cell lines, primarily by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S and G2/M transitions. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this effect [ 5 20 5 1 21 21 In general during oxidative phosphorylation electrons are properly channeled via mitochondrial electron transport chain and leading to reduction of oxygen into water and generation of ATP [ 13 19 16 22 2 ROS are produced during the metabolism as a by-product and are crucial for many cellular functions such as cell division and proliferation [ 22 2 3 Since a tight link exists between oxygen consumption, energy demand, and cellular redox status, we compared our results with transcriptomic data retrieved from the GEO database. The gene expression analysis by Semenza supports these findings by revealing the differential expression of several genes involved in the regulation of hypoxia, apoptosis, and cell proliferation [ 15 4 4 To corroborate our data obtained from reciprocal exposure experiment, another set of the transcriptomic data was analyzed in which cells were cultured under cyclic hypoxia. This piece of study shows that some of the genes that were significantly down-regulated under hypoxia as compared to cyclic hypoxia are PDK4, MCM6, RFC3, and MAD2L1, which were related to either energy metabolism or DNA replication or cell cycle. This set of data indicates that the changes in the hypoxia-mediated redox parameters and cell cycle patterns are transient and can be reversed with the re-introduction of normoxic conditions. These findings are consistent with the results of this study and demonstrate the general effect of hypoxia on the regulation of cell death and growth in cancer cells. So far studies discussed were performed in vitro, and the results may not fully reflect the complex in vivo environment of a solid tumor. So, next obvious question was, does hypoxia have a similar response in the lung adenocarcinoma tissues of the patients. For this, another set of transcriptomic data was analyzed in the patient samples cultured under hypoxia and normoxia. The analysis corroborates well with the findings of the A549 cells cultured under hypoxia i.e., out of the total differentially expressed genes more genes were down-regulated and many of them were included the genes related to energy metabolism or DNA replication or cell cycle or cellular redox. The results of this study have important implications for the understanding of the response of A549 lung cancer cells to hypoxia. The findings suggest that hypoxia plays a significant role in regulating the survival and growth of lung cancer cells, as well as inducing cell death in these cells. These results could provide a foundation for further research aimed at exploring the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of lung cancer cells to hypoxia, which could ultimately lead to the development of new therapies for the treatment of lung cancer. Thus, the present study demonstrated that oxygen tension is one of the central factors affecting cellular ROS levels. Our study confirms that elevation in ROS is an important feature of hypoxia which has a potential role in cell adaption in hypoxic cells. This increase in ROS level in the cells is responsible for various physiological changes. During these changes, many genes are down-regulated while some of them are up-regulated which helps the cells to adapt to a hypoxic environment and this may lead to resistance against different therapeutic agents. The transcriptomic profiling revealed substantial downregulation of critical regulators of cell cycle progression (e.g., CCND1, and CDK2) as well as DNA replication factors (RFC3, GMNN), suggesting that hypoxia induces proliferative arrest in lung cancer cells. This highlights a potential therapeutic angle where hypoxia-induced vulnerabilities in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation could be exploited using cell cycle inhibitors or agents targeting replication stress pathways. In addition, our findings showed coordinated downregulation of metabolic genes involved in the Krebs cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway (G6PD, IDH1, PDK4), alongside upregulation of glycolytic genes (HK2, ALDOC, ENO2), consistent with a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis. These results provide insights for therapeutic interventions aimed at disrupting metabolic plasticity in lung cancer cells under hypoxic tumors, such as glycolysis inhibitors or metabolic pathway modulators. Moreover, suppression of redox homeostasis genes (TXNRD1, GCLC, GCLM, NQO1) suggests increased oxidative stress, which may sensitize hypoxic tumor cells to ROS-inducing chemotherapeutics. Collectively, these transcriptome-driven findings provide a mechanistic foundation to design combination therapies targeting metabolism, redox homeostasis, and cell cycle regulation in hypoxia-adapted lung tumors. The major limitation of this study is that all experiments were performed in vitro using A549 cells, which may not fully replicate the complex and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment in vivo. Solid tumors experience varying levels of hypoxia, nutrient gradients, immune interactions, and stromal influences that can significantly alter cellular responses. Additionally, hypoxia is often intermittent or cyclic in tumors, unlike the controlled conditions used here. The study also lacks in vivo validation to confirm clinical relevance in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Thus, translation of these findings to therapeutic applications requires caution and further in vivo and clinical investigation. In conclusion, this study investigated the response of A549 lung cancer cells to hypoxia, with a focus on cell proliferation, cell cycle and gene expression. The finding of this study may help in designing suitable therapeutic interventions against lung cancer cells. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
