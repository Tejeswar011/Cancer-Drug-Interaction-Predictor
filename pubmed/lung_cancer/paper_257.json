The interaction of immune function, nutritional status, and inflammatory responses affects tumor progression and survival, yet their prognostic value in PD-1 inhibitor-treated HCC patients remains unclear. This study developed a novel nutritional-immune-inflammatory score (NIIS) to evaluate its prognostic value in HCC patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors. Patients and Methods We analyzed 355 HCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors (training: n=249; validation: n=106), the cohort included 18.6% Child-Pugh B patients. Fourteen nutritional, immune, and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. Prognostic indicators were selected via univariate and LASSO Cox regression. The NIIS was constructed and validated for OS prediction. A nomogram integrating the NIIS with clinical variables was developed and validated based on calibration curves, AUC, and DCA, and compared with the BCLC staging system. The primary outcome assessed was OS from the initiation of PD-1 inhibitor therapy in HCC patients. Results The NIIS (ALRI, APRI, PALBI, AAPR) showed strong prognostic stratification. High-risk patients had shorter OS (training: P =1.764×10^−8; verification: P=2.775×10^−6). Higher NIIS were significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, poor liver function grade, multiple and larger tumors, tumor thrombus, vascular invasion, and elevated AFP levels (P<0.05). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the NIIS as an independent prognostic factor for OS (training: HR=1.565, 95% CI: 1.273–1.925; verification: HR=1.341, 95% CI: 1.065–1.687). A nomogram integrating the NIIS with clinical variables was constructed for individualized prognosis prediction, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared to the conventional BCLC staging system. Conclusion The NIIS and nomogram provide a clinically useful tool for risk stratification in HCC immunotherapy, this model outperforming conventional staging systems and may optimize patient selection for PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Prospective multicenter studies are warranted to validate its generalizability.

It is also the fifth most common tumor and the third deadliest tumor in the world. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11–13 The nutritional status, immune function, and inflammation of patients are closely related to tumor development and progression. 14 15–23 24 25 26 27 28–30 Therefore, this study collected nutritional, immune, and inflammatory indicators from clinical HCC patients and developed a novel nutritional-immune-inflammatory score (NIIS) predictive model to evaluate the survival prognosis of HCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors clinically, aiming to screen beneficiary populations and guide treatment. Simultaneously, an NIIS nomogram was constructed and validated based on the NIIS and other clinical case characteristics to provide individualized predictions of survival probability and treatment guidance for HCC patients. Materials and Methods Study Object In this study, we enrolled patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who received PD-1 inhibitor therapy at the Department of Oncology and Hepatobiliary Surgery of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, China, between January 2018 and January 2023. Patients meeting all the following inclusion criteria were included: 1) age ≥18 years; 2) HCC diagnosis confirmed by imaging or histopathology according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria; 3) documented administration of PD-1 inhibitors with complete and traceable medical records; 4) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score of 0–1; and 5) Child-Pugh (CP) classification of grade A or B. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: 1) presence of severe underlying diseases; 2) concurrent malignancies other than HCC; or 3) history of severe immune-related adverse events or autoimmune diseases. A total of 355 patients were ultimately included and randomly divided into a training group (n=249) and a verification group (n=106) at a ratio of 7:3. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, China, and complied with the ethical principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, written informed consent was waived. Clinical trial number: not applicable. This study is a retrospective analysis and does not involve intervention-based clinical trial registration. Treatment Procedure Patients received intravenous infusion of PD-1 inhibitors at recommended doses: toripalimab (240 mg every 3 weeks), sintilimab, tislelizumab, camrelizumab, or pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks). Specific dosages and patient numbers are detailed in Table S1 Baseline Data Collection Patient demographic and tumor baseline data included: age, sex, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, Child-Pugh score, performance status (PS) score, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status, tumor number, maximum tumor diameter, vascular invasion, tumor thrombus, distant metastasis, metastatic sites, prior antitumor therapies, and type and treatment cycles of PD-1 inhibitors. Blood biochemical parameters comprised: D-dimer, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), white blood cell count, platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and fibrinogen. All blood samples for biochemical analysis were collected within 3 days before the initial administration of PD-1 inhibitors. Definition and Calculation of Nutritional-Immune-Inflammatory Indicators The pre-treatment blood biochemical parameters assessed prior to the first PD-1 inhibitor administration included 14 nutritional, immune, and inflammatory indices: platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio index (FARI), aspartate aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio (ALRI), aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio (APRI), albumin-to-alkaline phosphatase ratio (AAPR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), albumin-bilirubin index (ALBI), and platelet-albumin-bilirubin index (PALBI). Calculation formulas for all indices are provided in Table S2 Follow-up and Assessment The follow-up period concluded on May 31, 2024. During follow-up, laboratory parameters including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), complete blood count (CBC), and blood biochemical profiles were routinely monitored. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed every 2–3 cycles of PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time interval from the first administration of PD-1 inhibitors to tumor-related death. Construction of NIIS First, prognostic biomarkers associated with nutritional-immune-inflammatory status were identified via univariate Cox regression analysis. Variables with P < 0.05 were retained for further analysis. Subsequently, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was applied to evaluate the prognostic significance of these biomarkers, selecting variables with non-zero coefficients. Finally, the nutritional-immune-inflammatory prognostic score (NIIS) was calculated based on the retained variables. Validation of Prognostic Value of NIIS To investigate the association between the NIIS and clinicopathological characteristics, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed to compare NIIS across subgroups stratified by clinicopathological features. The predictive value of the NIIS for 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival (OS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in both the training and verification group. Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the median NIIS as the cut-off value. Survival differences and OS between these groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Log rank tests. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to identify independent prognostic factors associated with OS in HCC. Construction and Validation of the Nomogram Prognostic nomogram for overall survival (OS) was constructed in the training cohort using multivariate Cox regression analysis with backward stepwise selection based on the minimal Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. The predictive performance of the nomogram was validated in both training and verification groups through time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots. Clinical decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to compare the clinical utility of the nomogram with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. Statistical Analysis Continuous variables with non-normal distributions were described using medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Independent two-group comparisons of continuous variables were performed using t-tests, while categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-square tests. Survival outcomes were evaluated via the Kaplan-Meier method, with between-group differences assessed by Log rank tests. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to identify prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS), with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 24.0 (IBM Corp)., GraphPad Prism 9.5 (GraphPad Software), and R software (version 4.3.0; R Foundation). A two-sided P Results Baseline Characteristics of Patients This study included a total of 355 HCC patients. The median age of the patients was 55 years (48–64), with 310 males (87.3%) and 45 females (12.7%). Most patients had hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (82.3%), were classified as BCLC stage C (77.7%), and had Child-Pugh grade A (81.4%). The median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 16.03 months (95% CI: 14.62–17.22), with 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS rates of 66.2%, 31.2%, and 17.3%, respectively.

( A C D F G I J L Discussion Currently, immunotherapy has been widely applied in various cancers, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, as primary immune checkpoint inhibitors, have become a mainstay treatment for HCC patients. 31 32 The interaction between nutrition, immunity, inflammation, and tumors exhibits specific associations. Current studies highlight the critical roles of systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and nutritional status in modulating immunotherapy responses. 33 34 35–38 39–42 The NIIS comprises four clinically accessible indicators—ALRI, APRI, PALBI, and AAPR—whose individual predictive potential has been validated across multiple malignancies.ALRI, reflecting nutritional and immune-inflammatory status, combines aspartate aminotransferase and lymphocyte counts. Liao et al demonstrated that postoperative ALRI accurately predicts clinical outcomes in HCC patients after hepatectomy, 43 44 45 46–48 49 50 51 The NIIS model demonstrated robust predictive performance for OS in HCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. In the training group, the AUC values for predicting 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS were approximately 0.7, while the verification group achieved AUC values of 0.726, 0.844, and 0.838, respectively, surpassing previous studies. 52–54 55 56 This study has several limitations. First, it is a single-center retrospective study. Although internal validation via bootstrap resampling and external validation in an independent cohort enhanced reliability, prospective multicenter studies are still required to further validate its generalizability. Second, all included patients were of Chinese ethnicity, necessitating additional evaluation in diverse ethnic populations. Third, the lack of objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) data limits our ability to evaluate whether the NIIS possesses predictive value for treatment response in addition to its prognostic utility. Future prospective studies should incorporate standardized radiological response assessments to address this question. Furthermore, tumor molecular biomarkers such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were not incorporated, warranting further refinement of the predictive model. Finally, molecular mechanisms underlying immunotherapy responses remain unexplored, and future studies should investigate these pathways to elucidate prognostic heterogeneity. If validated in larger multicenter cohorts, the NIIS score could be integrated into treatment decision-making to identify highrisk patients who may benefit from TKIs instead of PD-1 monotherapy, intensified regimens (eg, PD-1 + TKI combinations), clinical trial enrollment, or early palliative care integration. Conclusion In conclusion, the NIIS and its associated nomogram provide a clinically practical tool for risk stratification in HCC immunotherapy. By incorporating multidimensional biological profiling to address the limitations of conventional staging systems, this approach may facilitate the development of personalized treatment strategies and optimize patient selection for PD-1 inhibitor therapy.
