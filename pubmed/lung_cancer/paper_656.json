See http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Abstract Background Currently, an epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII)-specific peptide (PEPvIII) vaccine has not achieved satisfactory outcomes in several clinical trials for glioblastoma. This is probably due to the poor immunogenicity of the PEPvIII peptide vaccine and the harshly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Hence, identifying strategies to enhance tumor-specific T cell immune responses and reverse immune suppression is crucial for achieving the maximum beneficial therapeutic effect. Methods To enhance the immunogenicity of the PEPvIII vaccine, we have developed a novel oncolytic adenovirus-based vaccine by genetically incorporating the PEPvIII peptide into the adenovirus hexon protein, naming this construct Ad5-D24-PEPvIII. However, the upregulation of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in the tumor microenvironment following oncolytic virus therapy may limit its therapeutic effectiveness. To address this, we first attempted to co-express soluble programmed cell death 1 (sPD-1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the E4 region of Ad5-D24-PEPvIII. Subsequently, we combined the oncolytic adenovirus-based PEPvIII vaccine carrying GM-CSF with a PD-L1 inhibitor. Two immunocompetent mouse glioma models were used to evaluate their antitumor effects in vivo. The immune cell status within the tumor microenvironment was assessed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. CD8 + Results Local administration of Ad5-D24-PEPvIII, which presents high copies of tumor-specific antigen PEPvIII in the hexon protein, successfully activated PEPvIII-specific T cell responses. Co-expression of sPD-1 and GM-CSF in the E4 region of Ad5-D24-PEPvIII could increase the release of proinflammatory cytokines, activate myeloid cells and promote the maturation of dendritic cells, thereby further enhancing the activation and proliferation of CD8 + Conclusion Our work suggests that the efficient presentation of PEPvIII, achieved by modifying the hexon protein of the oncolytic adenovirus, combined with the adjuvant function of GM-CSF and blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of the PEPvIII vaccine against glioblastoma. In addition, this combination strategy also provides a promising and personalized treatment for patients with cancer.

The oncolytic adenovirus-based PEPvIII vaccine, when combined with the adjuvant function of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and blockade of the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis, can overcome the limitations of traditional vaccines by remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing T cell immune responses to tumor antigens and tumor neoantigens. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY This study demonstrates that the oncolytic adenovirus-based PEPvIII vaccine, which enhances PEPvIII-specific T cell responses through the synergistic action of GM-CSF and blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, effectively suppresses the growth of gliomas and warrants further testing of the novel vaccine in clinical trials. Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system in adults, hard to remove completely by surgery and prone to recurrence. 1 2 3 4 5 6 In recent years, oncolytic viruses have received considerable attention in tumor therapy because of their ability to specifically lyse tumor cells and induce a strong immune response. 7 8 9 Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a ligand for PD-1, is commonly expressed in tumor cells and immune cells. Infection of tumor cells with an oncolytic virus leads to the expression of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which interacts with PD-1 on the surface of T cells to inhibit T cell function, potentially resulting in drug resistance. 10 11 12 13 14 + 15 16 In this study, we generated a novel oncolytic adenovirus vaccine by modifying the second-generation oncolytic virus Delta-24-RGD, a conditionally replicating adenovirus capable of replicating in retinoblastoma protein-deficient cells. 17 18 Materials and methods Cell lines and cell culture The human malignant glioma cell lines U87 MG and U251, the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, and the mouse malignant glioma cell lines GL261 and CT-2A were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. GL261 glioma cells and CT-2A glioma cells co-expressed with the mouse EGFRvIII gene and firefly luciferase gene (termed GL261/EGFRvIII and CT-2A/EGFRvIII, respectively) were prepared by transfection with the lentiviral vector system retained in Xia’s laboratory. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, California, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sijiqing, Hangzhou, China), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 200 µg/mL L-glutamine, and were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 Plasmid construction and preparation of recombinant oncolytic adenovirus Following a previously reported methodology, 19 21 Bam Sfu Swa Escherichia coli Pac Swa E. coli Pac Swa E. coli Pac 22 RNA extraction and real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted from mouse GBMs injected with oncolytic adenoviruses and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a HiPure Universal RNA kit (Magen, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China). RNA samples were quantified using a Nanodrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and stored at −80°C. cDNA synthesis was performed using the Prime Script RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, Liaoning, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) using a SYBR green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The target genes were adenovirus E4 and Hexon, with GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) serving as the housekeeping gene. All samples were run in triplicate.

The concentrations of sPD-1 and GM-CSF were determined using a mouse PD-1 ELISA kit (NeoBioscience, Shenzhen, China) or a mouse GM-CSF ELISA kit (NeoBioscience, Shenzhen, China). Animal studies All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shaanxi Normal University, China. C57BL/6 mice, 6–8 weeks old, were purchased from the Shaanxi Normal University Laboratory Animal Centre. The mice were maintained in a controlled environment (12/12 hours light/dark cycle, 23±1°C, 55±10% humidity) and given free access to food and water. GL261/EGFRvIII cells (5×10 4 4 7 To evaluate the combined therapeutic effect of oncolytic adenovirus and PD-L1 blockade, GL261/EGFRvIII cells or CT-2A/EGFRvIII cells were implanted according to the above method. Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-GM-CSF (5×10 7 Flow cytometry and cell separation Tumors were excised from the brains of tumor-bearing mice and washed with PBS on day 7 after the last oncolytic adenovirus treatment, unless otherwise specified. The tumors were then minced, digested with 0.66 mg/mL Collagenase D and 8 U/mL DNase I (both from Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in serum-free Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium for 30 min at 37°C, and then filtered through a 70 µm nylon filter (Corning, New York, USA) to obtain a single-cell suspension. Immune cells were separated by gradient centrifugation with 30% and 70% Percoll (GE Healthcare, 17-0891-02, DE, USA). Cell precipitates were collected and washed twice with a complete RPMI 1640 medium and stained with antibodies specific for antigenic markers. Cell surface antigens were stained using the following antibodies: mouse CD45 PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone: 30-F11, BioLegend, #103132), mouse CD3 FITC (clone: 17A2, BioLegend, #100204), mouse CD4 APC (clone: RM4-5, eBioscience, #17-0042-82), mouse CD8a APC/Cy7 (clone: 53–6.7, BioLegend, #100708), CD11b APC/Cy7 (clone: M1-70, BioLegend, #101226), mouse CD11c APC or FITC (clone: N418, BioLegend, #117 309 or #117305), mouse MHCII PerCP-eFluor 710 (clone: M5/114.15.2, eBioscience, #46-5321-82), mouse CD86 PE (clone: GL-1, eBioscience, #12-0862-82), mouse F4/80 PE-Cy7 (clone: BM8, eBioscience, #25-4801-82), mouse Gr-1 APC (clone: RB6-8C5, BioLegend, #108411), mouse PD-L1 APC or PE (clone: 10F.9G2, BioLegend, #124311, #124307), mouse PD-1 PE/Dazzle 594 or PE (clone: 29F.1A12, BioLegend, #135227, #135205), mouse TIM-3 PE (clone: RMT3-23, eBioscience, #12-5870-81), and NK 1.1 PE (clone: PK136, BioLegend, #108707). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with Fixation and Permeabilization Solution (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA); washed three times; and stained with the following antibodies: mouse IFN-γ PE-eFluor 610 (clone: XMG1.2, eBioscience, #61-7311-82), mouse TNF-α PE-Cy7 (clone: MP6-XT22, eBioscience, #25-7321-80), mouse IL-12 PE (clone: 27537,eBioscience, #MA5-23559), mouse IL-10 APC (clone: JES5-16E3, BioLegend, #505009), and mouse Foxp3 PE (clone: FJK-16s, eBioscience, #12-5773-80). Samples were collected on a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX S instrument, and data were analyzed with FlowJo software. Isolation of spleen and tumor-infiltrating CD8 + Mouse spleen cells were isolated, placed on a 100 µm cell strainer, and filtered into a centrifuge tube. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium and centrifuged at 350×g for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) to lyse the red blood cells. Splenocytes are obtained after centrifugation again. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells were collected by density gradient centrifugation. Then, the CD8 + + Monocytes were isolated from the bone marrow of the femurs and tibias of the syngeneic mice. Subsequently, the monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, recombinant mouse GM-CSF (20 ng/mL, PeproTech, Cranbury, New Jersey, USA), and recombinant mouse interleukin (IL)-4 (20 ng/mL, PeproTech, Cranbury, New Jersey, USA) for 7 days. The non-adherent cells, that is, the bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, were treated with 1 µg/mL lipopolysaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) for an additional 18 hours to induce dendritic cell maturation. Antigen-stimulated CD8 + To prepare target cells, mouse primary astrocytes, GL261 cells, GL261/EGFRvIII cells, CT-2A cells, and CT-2A/EGFRvIII cells were inoculated in round-bottom 96-well plates at 2×10 4 + + 5 + 5 + 5 5 Cell proliferation assay Tumor-infiltrating CD8 + + 5 4 Neoantigen-specific T cell response assays Tumor-infiltrating CD8 + 5 5 Splenocytes were isolated from tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice treated with various oncolytic adenoviruses and were cultured in a round-bottom 96-well plate (5×10 5 2 Bioluminescence imaging Tumor growth in the animals was monitored via bioluminescence imaging. Mice bearing GL261/EGFRvIII cells or CT-2A/EGFRvIII cells were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin (150 mg/kg), and animal imaging was performed using an In vivo imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Data were analyzed with Living Image software. Researchers involved in animal monitoring and data analysis were blinded to the treatment assigned to each animal. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry Tumor tissues were collected, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, Beijing, China) for 72 hours, and stored at 4°C in 70% ethanol for further processing. Then, the tumor tissue was embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 µm thick sections, and H&E-stained for pathological detection. For immunohistochemistry, after antigen retrieval, blocking endogenous peroxidase, and blocking non-specific binding with a blocking buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin, the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with a moderately diluted primary antibody. The primary antibodies used were anti-CD8 (1:100, ABclonal, #A23081), anti-CD68 (1:500, Abcam, #ab125212), and anti-iNOS (1:200, Proteintech, #22 226–1-AP or Abcam, #ab3523). The next day, the sections were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline with tween-20 (PBST) for 10 min, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (VECTASTAIN ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) for 60 min, and finally stained with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA). The HRP enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of DAB, resulting in a brown precipitate that can be visualized under a microscope. The stained sections were observed under a microscope. Statistics Animal survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and statistically analyzed using Log-Rank test (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). One-way analysis of variance was applied for comparison of more than two groups (GraphPad Prism V.8). Measured data were expressed as mean±SD. A p value<0.05 was considered significant; p>0.05 indicated no significance (ns: not significant). Results Oncolytic adenovirus-based PEPvIII vaccine promotes T cell activation and induces PEPvIII-specific immune responses According to a previously published paper by Di et al 21 figure 1A Pac figure 1B online supplemental figure 1 online supplemental figure 2A,B 7 figure 1C + + + + + + figure 1D figure 1E + + figure 1F,G + While Ad5-D24-PEPvIII can induce T cell immune responses against tumors, tumor cells often employ various mechanisms to evade immune system attacks. One such mechanism involves the inhibition of T cell activity by upregulating the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of the tumor cells. It was previously shown that infecting tumor cells with oncolytic virus leads to upregulated PD-L1 in tumor cells. 23 24 25 26 figure 1H figure 1I + + + online supplemental figure 3A online supplemental figure 3B Figure 1 Oncolytic adenovirus vaccine with PEPvIII-modified in hexon protein induces PEPvIII-specific T cell responses and proliferation. ( A B C D + + + E + + F + G + 5 5 H I In summary, although the oncolytic adenovirus vaccine with PEPvIII modification in the hexon protein can efficiently provoke PEPvIII-specific T cell responses, the increased expression of PD-L1 in the TME caused by oncolytic adenovirus infection would engage with PD-1 on the surface of T cells, resulting in immunosuppression and may, in turn, weaken T cell responses mediated by the vaccine. Co-expression of GM-CSF and sPD-1 enhances the antiglioma activity of the oncolytic adenovirus-based PEPvIII vaccine in the syngeneic immunocompetent mouse models To reverse PD-1/PD-L1 mediated immunosuppression caused by the upregulated expression of PD-L1 in TME due to the oncolytic adenovirus infection, we attempted to co-express GM-CSF and sPD-1 in the E4 region of the oncolytic adenoviruses for therapeutic effects. To do so, the genes encoding the extracellular domains of murine PD-1 and murine GM-CSF were inserted into the E4 region of the plasmid pAd5-D24-HVR5-PEPvIII-Fiber-RGD. The resulting oncolytic adenovirus, named Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF, features a PEPvIII modification in the hexon protein and co-expresses murine GM-CSF and murine sPD-1 in the E4 region; we also refer to it as an \"all-in-one\" vaccine. Using a similar strategy, a control recombinant oncolytic adenovirus, Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-GM-CSF, which expressed only murine GM-CSF, was also generated ( figure 2A 12 Online supplemental figure 4A online supplemental figure 4B online supplemental figure 4C,S1 Figure 2 Therapeutic efficacy of Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF in two orthotopic glioma models. ( A B E 7 C F D G H I J Next, we used two intracranial glioma murine models to evaluate the antitumor activity of different types of oncolytic adenoviruses. In the GL261/EGFRvIII murine model, tumor progression was monitored using luciferase-based imaging starting on day 14 post-implantation ( figure 2B figure 2B–D figure 2B–D figure 2E figure 2F,G figure 2G figure 2D and G figure 2H + + figure 2I,J + However, it remained unclear whether the enhancement of antitumor activity depends on the highly efficient antigen presentation mediated by hexon modification or is solely attributed to the immunomodulatory effects of GM-CSF and sPD-1. To validate the necessity and pivotal role of PEPvIII modification in enhancing the antitumor immune response and therapeutic efficacy, and to distinguish the independent contributions of tumor antigen presentation and immunomodulation, we generated an additional control adenovirus, Ad5-D24-sPD-1-GM-CSF, which expresses murine GM-CSF and murine sPD-1 but lacks the PEPvIII modification in the hexon protein ( figure 2A online supplemental figure 5A online supplemental figure 5B online supplemental figure 5C We then evaluated the antitumor effect of Ad5-D24-sPD-1-GM-CSF in vivo. Compared with Ad5-D24 treatment, Ad5-D24-sPD-1-GM-CSF suppressed tumor growth and prolonged median survival in both orthotopic glioma murine models. Specifically, in the GL261/EGFRvIII murine model, median survival was extended from 33 days (Ad5-D24 group) to 39 days (Ad5-D24-sPD-1-GM-CSF vs Ad5-D24, p<0.01) ( figure 2D figure 2G figure 2E–G figure 1B,C figure 2D Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF enhances PEPvIII-specific T cell responses by promoting immune cell activation To better understand the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of the “all-in-one” oncolytic adenovirus-based PEPvIII vaccine and to further clarify how the PEPvIII modification of the hexon protein and the immune modulatory factors expressed in the E4 region enhance the tumor antigen-specific immune response, we characterized the types and functional states of immune cell populations recruited into tumors by various oncolytic adenovirus treatments. In two orthotopic glioma murine models, compared with Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-injected mice, those treated with Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-GM-CSF or Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF showed increased infiltration of T lymphocytes (CD45 + + + figure 3A figure 3B,C + figure 3D figure 3A–C figure 3A figure 3E online supplemental figure 6 online supplemental figure 7 + figure 3F online supplemental figure 8 + + figure 3G,H online supplemental figure 9 Figure 3 Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF enhances PEPvIII-specific T cell responses and strengthens T cell function.

( A + + + + + + B C D E F + + + + + + + + Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-GM-CSF combined with PD-L1 blockade prolongs the survival of glioma-bearing mice by remodeling the immunosuppressive TME Our results above indicated that the “all-in-one” vaccine strategy enhanced tumor antigen-specific T cell responses by ameliorating the suppression of immune cells. However, it did not show an evident advantage in tumor treatment compared with Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-GM-CSF, likely due to the inefficient blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis by sPD-1. Given the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in tumor therapy, we next attempted to combine the vaccine with a PD-L1 inhibitor to enhance tumor treatment efficacy. We compared the therapeutic efficacy of Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF monotherapy with that of a combination treatment consisting of Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-GM-CSF and an anti-PD-L1 antibody in two syngeneic orthotopic glioma murine models. In the combination treatment group, four intraperitoneal doses of the anti-PD-L1 antibody were administered ( figure 5A figure 5B,C figure 5D figure 5E,F + figure 5G–I Figure 5 The combination of Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-GM-CSF and PD-L1 blockade enhances the therapeutic effect against glioma in both GL261/EGFRvIII and CT-2A/EGFRvIII murine models.

In an adenovirus particle, there are typically 240 copies of hexon protein. Here, to maximally present the number of PEPvIII in oncolytic adenovirus particles, we modified the hexon protein of Delta-24-RGD oncolytic adenovirus vector with PEPvIII. In two orthotopic glioma murine models, the experimental results showed that compared with the PBS group, after treatment with Ad5-D24-PEPvIII, the number and activity of infiltrating T lymphocytes, including CD8 + + + 14 37 38 39 Consistent with previous studies, 26 40 41 et al 42 43 + 44 45 + To further dissect the independent contributions of tumor antigen presentation and immunomodulatory factor expression, we generated Ad5-D24-sPD-1-GM-CSF, a control adenovirus co-expressing GM-CSF and sPD-1 but lacking PEPvIII modification on the hexon protein. Ad5-D24-sPD-1-GM-CSF demonstrated comparable in vitro oncolytic activity to Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF. However, in vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed that Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with Ad5-D24-sPD-1-GM-CSF in the CT-2A/EGFRvIII murine model, whereas both adenoviruses exhibited comparable short-term tumor suppression in the GL261/EGFRvIII murine model. This finding suggests that, owing to the inherently high immunogenicity of the GL261 model, the immunostimulatory effects of GM-CSF and sPD-1 alone were sufficient to achieve an initial suppression of tumor growth, even without the PEPvIII-mediated enhancement of tumor antigen presentation. Nevertheless, Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF treatment further prolonged the median survival of mice compared with Ad5-D24-sPD-1-GM-CSF in both glioma murine models. This survival benefit is likely attributed to enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses mediated by PEPvIII modification, as supported by ELISA results showing that T cell responses against EGFRvIII + However, although the analysis of TME cell components showed that the co-expression of sPD-1 and GM-CSF was effective in reversing immune silencing, the median survival of mice treated with Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-sPD-1-GM-CSF was not significantly prolonged compared with the Ad5-D24-PEPvIII-GM-CSF-treated group. We speculated that this may be related to the low concentration of sPD-1 secreted within the TME. In addition, as the virus colonizes the tumor, the host’s antiviral immunity is activated and mobilized to limit the replication and spread of the virus, ultimately leading to its clearance, which limits the persistent expression of sPD-1. 46 Numerous studies have shown that combining oncolytic viruses with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors can not only synergistically activate the immune system and enhance the antitumor immune response, but also overcome tumor resistance to these inhibitors. 13 47 48 + + + In summary, we constructed a novel oncolytic adenovirus-based PEPvIII vaccine by modifying the hexon protein with PEPvIII. When this vaccine is combined with the adjuvant function of GM-CSF and blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, it can maximally enhance T cell-specific responses against PEPvIII and tumor neoantigens, and greatly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine. Our research overcomes the shortcomings of traditional peptide-based vaccines and provides a more effective, individualized treatment for patients with tumors.
