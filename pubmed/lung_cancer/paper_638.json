During TTNA, the needle is often directed through the pleura and lung to reach and aspirate target tissues, such as the lung or lymph nodes. This procedure is commonly used to obtain tissue samples for diagnostic purposes. Over the past decade, invasive bronchoscopy, including endobronchial ultrasound biopsy (EBUS), radial probe, navigational, and robotic bronchoscopy, has improved the yield and safety profile of lung nodule biopsies while ensuring adequate lung tissue sampling. In this review article, we aim to compare the differences in efficacy, safety, and diagnostic yield among various diagnostic modalities in pulmonary medicine.

We performed a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed articles, clinical guidelines, and recent studies to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, clinical utility, and safety of CT-TTNA and bronchoscopic techniques, including EBUS, RB, and ENB. The modalities were compared in terms of key parameters, such as sensitivity and overall accuracy for peripheral and central lung lesions. The safety profile for modalities and accessibility in clinical practice was also compared. 2.1 Core Tips Computed tomography-guided transthoracic needle aspiration (CT-TTNA) is used to diagnose suspicious lung lesions. Lung nodules are detected by early screening, and the treatment for lung carcinoma is highly personalized based on genetic markers in the sample for non-small cell lung cancer. This can be challenging to obtain through TTNA alone due to the smaller sample size, which may not be enough to run the specimens for the tumor markers. Even with adequate samples, we must follow up with the advanced bronchoscopy method for staging. With the availability of advanced fluoroscopic bronchoscopy and the complications related to TTNA, performing TTNA has become marginalized. Considering the lower diagnostic yield, lower Negative Predictive Value (NPV), higher contraindications, and higher complications, it may be time to choose other advanced diagnostic modalities over CT-guided TTNA. 2.2 Diagnostic Yield and Safety of Various Diagnostic Modalities in Lung NodulesCT-guided TTNA/TTNB A meta-analysis of 48 studies by DiBardino et al. 8 8 In a retrospective study conducted by Zhang et al. P P P P P 9 10 A retrospective study conducted by Chaudry et al. 11 In a retrospective cohort study conducted by Munoz et al. 12 Currently, diagnosing lung carcinoma requires understanding molecular changes and testing for mutations like EGFR, BRAF, and KRAS G12C, as well as rearrangements in various genes. Treatment has advanced with multiple generations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors tailored to these mutations. Achieving this requires sufficient sampling for Rapid Onsite Evaluation (ROSE), Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, Papanicolaou staining, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, which TTNA cannot provide [ 13 14 According to a study by Vanderlaan et al. 15 9 16 < 17 19 20 The ongoing VERITAS trial (Navigation Endoscopy to Reach Indeterminate Lung Nodules versus TTNA) is a randomized controlled trial to compare ENB with CT-TTNB for the diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules measuring 10-30 mm in diameter, with a pre-test probability of malignancy of at least 10%. It aims to provide valuable data on the diagnostic approach to lung nodules, which frequently represent the earliest and most treatable stage of lung cancer [ 21 Other factors that influence the diagnostic yield of CT-TTNB are listed below:  Size of lesion 22 24 22 26  Location of the nodule: et al. 27 et al. 28 29 30  Needle path: 30 32 Several factors significantly influence the decision-making process for selecting patients to undergo CT-guided TTNA/ TTNB. Key considerations include the patient's financial situation, which can determine their access to these procedures and related care. Additionally, the availability of alternative diagnostic modalities, such as MRI or PET scans, may impact whether a CT-based approach is deemed necessary or appropriate. Lastly, the expertise of the institution and the medical professionals performing the procedures plays a crucial role in ensuring that the right patients are chosen for these interventions, thereby affecting the overall diagnostic yield of CT-TTNA/TTNB. Collectively, these factors contribute to optimizing patient outcomes and maximizing the effectiveness of the diagnostic process [ 33 34 2.3 Virtual Bronchoscopic Navigation (VBN)/ Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (ENB) According to a pooled study of 13 research works, procedures using VBN assistance for biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions had an overall diagnostic yield of 74%, and lesions less than 2 cm had a reduced yield of 67%. According to a meta-analysis of 39 investigations where VBN was combined with other image-guided techniques, a diagnostic yield of 72% was found [ 35 37 et al. 35 2.4 Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Bronchoscopy A retrospective study by Patel et al vs vs P vs P vs P 36 2.5 Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) A prospective study by Zhu et al. 37 et al. 38 et al. 39 2.6 Robotic Bronchoscopy A study involving 131 cases found that shape-sensitive Robotic Bronchoscopy (ss-RAB) has a sensitivity of nearly 80%, increasing for lesions larger than 1.8 cm and those located centrally [ 40 41 42 44 45 47 Despite its known advantages, current research findings indicate that the diagnostic yield of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RB) may be inferior to that of transbronchial needle biopsy (TTNB). This notable discrepancy underscores the necessity for more comprehensive and systematically structured studies aimed at better defining the specific role of RB in the diagnostic evaluation of lung nodules. Such investigations could yield precise insights into the optimal scenarios for the application of this technique, including the types of lung nodules most amenable to successful diagnosis through RB [ 48 50 Several critical factors can significantly influence the generally favorable diagnostic yield reported in robotic-assisted bronchoscopy. Among these are the prevalence of malignancy within the specific patient population being studied, which can impact the likelihood of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Additionally, the selection criteria employed for participant inclusion in clinical studies can introduce variability and affect the perceived efficacy of RB. Furthermore, the issue of publication bias, where studies with positive results are more likely to be published, may skew the existing body of research, leading to an exaggerated perception of the success of RB in clinical practice [ 47 50 For a comparative analysis of the efficacy of CT-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (CT-TTNA) versus newer modalities, relevant data are mentioned in Table 1 2.7 Summarizing Pros and Cons of Conventional versus Newer Techniques CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB) is a widely used method for diagnosing lung nodules, particularly those located near the chest wall or in deeper regions of the lung. It is often preferred due to its high diagnostic yield. However, TTNB carries a risk of complications, such as pneumothorax, especially when crossing lung fissures or in patients with emphysema, which may limit its use in certain cases. A more detailed overview of its advantages and limitations is presented in Table 2 Bronchoscopic techniques, including electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB), radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS), and robotic bronchoscopy (RB), offer an alternative approach, particularly for patients at higher risk of pneumothorax. These methods also allow for the simultaneous sampling of multiple lymph nodes via EBUS when evaluating suspected malignancies. RB, an emerging technology, enhances bronchoscopic access to peripheral lung nodules, addressing some limitations of traditional bronchoscopy. While RB generally has a favorable safety profile (Fig. 1 50 51 Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that ENB may be a viable alternative to TTNB, particularly when factoring in procedural risks, healthcare costs, and patient selection. While newer bronchoscopic techniques may have higher initial costs, they can be cost-effective if applied to appropriately selected patients. However, uncertainty remains regarding the extent to which the reduced complication rates and potential clinical benefits of ENB outweigh its higher procedural costs compared to TTNB in diagnosing malignant pulmonary nodules [ 50 54 2 2.8 Ways to Reduce Technical Errors during CT-TTNA/TTNB and Bronchoscopic Procedures Factors, such as a patient moving during a procedure and causing image blurriness, can impact the diagnostic accuracy of CT-TTNA or bronchoscopy. To mitigate this factor, various studies have suggested integrating error mitigation techniques, deep learning models, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and image deblurring methods to improve diagnostic accuracy. The AI-based segmentation in CT scans could help localize lung nodules better, thereby improving the success rate of biopsies or targeted bronchoscopic procedures. AI-based models trained on multimodal imaging (CT, PET, bronchoscopy data) could improve decision-making by predicting which biopsy method is more likely to succeed based on lesion location, size, and surrounding structures. AI models can assist pulmonologists and interventional radiologists in providing real-time procedural guidance to reduce human error in lesion detection and improve lesion localization, and recommend the optimal biopsy approach based on imaging and procedural data [ 55 55 56 56 1 This bar chart compares complication rates of different lung nodule biopsy methods, including CT-Guided Biopsy, Conventional Transbronchial Biopsy (TBB), Electromagnetic Navigational Bronchoscopy (ENB), and Robotic-Assisted Bronchoscopy (RAB). The y-axis represents the complication rate per 100 cases (%), while the x-axis lists different complications: pneumothorax, bleeding, infection, and respiratory failure. Each bar represents the complication rate for a given technique, with numeric values displayed on top. CT-guided biopsy has the highest pneumothorax rate (25%), whereas RAB has the lowest across all categories. The rates are derived from literature sources and reflect the approximate percentage of cases experiencing each complication [ 57 58 2.9 Cost Comparison between Techniques The cost of the procedure depends not only on the modality of lung nodule biopsy but also on location (inpatient versus outpatient), medical insurance coverage, post-procedural complications, and the need for a repeat biopsy, among others. Hence, there is a wide range of variability in determining the cost of various modalities of lung nodule biopsy Table 3 While the initial cost of using advanced technologies, such as robotic-assisted lung nodule biopsy, might be higher than traditional methods, the reduction in complication rates and the potential decrease in the need for repeat biopsies could lead to overall cost savings in the patient's diagnostic journey [ 59 61 2 2.10 Integration of Newer Technology The optimization of biopsy techniques for lung nodules relies not only on procedural advancements but also on strategies to mitigate errors and enhance diagnostic accuracy. Recent developments in measurement error mitigation, such as those described in quantum computing research, have parallels in procedural optimization for guided biopsy techniques, where reducing inaccuracies in navigation and tissue sampling can significantly improve diagnostic yield [ 62 62 63 62 CONCLUSION Over the past few decades, CT-guided fine-needle aspiration and biopsy (TTNA/TTNB) have been recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary lesions in the peripheral and mid-lung zones. This technique has provided reliable results and has been integral in guiding treatment decisions. However, recent advancements in imaging technologies and minimally invasive procedures have introduced new modalities that may offer improved accuracy and reduced complication rates. These innovative approaches, which often integrate advanced imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, MRI, or hybrid methods, warrant re-evaluating our current practices. Nevertheless, comprehensive prospective studies must be conducted to accurately position these newer modalities as the gold standard. This research should focus on gathering relevant clinical data, comparing outcomes, and understanding the implications of adopting these newer methods in routine clinical practice. It would be beneficial to fully transition to these alternatives only when substantial evidence is collected, further validating their efficacy and safety in diagnosing pulmonary lesions.
