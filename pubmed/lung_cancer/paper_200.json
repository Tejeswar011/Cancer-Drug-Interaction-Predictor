Summary Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) emerge as crucial determinants of anti-tumor immune responses and clinical outcomes. However, their clinical significance and formation mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil (FOLFOX) significantly enhances TLS formation in HCC tissues, correlating with improved therapeutic efficacy and prolonged progression-free survival in patients with HCC.

These data suggest TLSs as potential biomarkers for therapy efficacy and support HAIC-combined immunotherapy as a promising strategy for patients with HCC. Limitations of the study There are several limitations in our study. First, the animal model used does not fully replicate clinical HAIC regimen, limiting our ability to fully mimic patient treatment. Although TLS-like structures were observed in this mouse model, they were less organized than those in human samples. This suggests that hepatic arterial delivery, optimized drug dosage and treatment duration may be critical for TLS formation. However, establishing a reliable intra-arterial infusion model in mice remains technically challenging, due to the extremely small diameter and high pressure of the hepatic artery. Second, recent advances in spatial transcriptomics and proteomics hold potential for resolving tissue architecture and elucidating cellular interactions and signaling pathways. 54 , 55 , 56 Resource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Dr. Limin Zheng ( zhenglm@mail.sysu.edu.cn Materials availability This study did not generate new unique reagents.

N/A Experimental model and study participant details Patients and specimens Tumor samples were collected from both male and female patients diagnosed with advanced or unresectable HCC and treated at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China) between 2018 and 2024. A total of 297 patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, 207 patients received FOLFOX-HAIC treatment prior to tumor resection, including a primary cohort of 123 patients, a validation cohort of 35 patients, and 49 patients who received FOLFOX-HAIC in combination with anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy before resection. Additionally, 90 patients who had not received prior systemic therapy were included as an untreated group. Allocation to treatment groups was based on real-world clinical decisions made through multidisciplinary team discussions. Tumor samples were collected from resected specimens immediately after surgery. The amount of tissue collected from each patient depended on tumor size and the availability of viable tumor tissues. Clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table S1 The treatment response was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, 67 Mouse model Female C57BL/6 mice aged 6–8 weeks were purchased from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center and housed under pathogen-free conditions at Sun Yat-sen University. All animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Care and Animal Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University. For the orthotopic tumor model, 68 5 Cell line and cell culture The murine HCC cell line Hepa1-6 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cell line was routinely tested and confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were used for T cell isolation. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, C11995500BT, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; SFBS, BOVOGEN) in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Method details Evaluation and quantification of TLSs Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections of the tumor lesions were scanned to obtain whole-slide images. TLSs were identified and assessed in both the tumor and peri-tumor regions via H&E staining. For quantification, the density of TLSs was calculated as the number of TLSs per unit area (TLSs/cm 2 Immunostaining Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from HCC patients were cut into 4-μm-thick sections for immunohistochemical (IHC), multiplex immunohistochemical (mIHC), or immunofluorescence (IF) staining. FFPE slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 0.3% H 2 2 69 Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was performed using a PANO 6-plex IHC kit (10294100100, PANOVUE) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. FFPE slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and treated with 0.3% H 2 2 Bulk RNA sequencing analysis Total RNA was extracted from 38 resected HCC tumors treated with HAIC (responders, n n 15 Table S4 Single cell preparation, preparation and sequencing Freshly resected tissues were immediately processed to prepare single-cell suspensions. The tissues were washed with DPBS (without calcium and magnesium), cut into pieces, and digested by collagenase II (2 mg/mL), collagenase IV (2 mg/mL) and dispase (0.2 mg/mL) under 37°C for 15–25 min. The dissociated cells were filtered through 40-μm cell strainers. Red blood cells were lysed using Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer. The cell concentration and viability were determined using a Cellometer Auto 2000 (Nexcelom, USA) after AO/PI staining. Single cells were partitioned into droplet emulsions using the Chromium Single Cell 5′ V2 Solution (10× Genomics Inc.) following the manufacture’s protocols for scRNA/TCR-Seq with 5′ feature barcoding. Gene expression libraries and V(D)J repertoire libraries were constructed according to the standard 10× Genomics protocol and sequenced on a Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina). scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data analysis For the scRNA-seq data, cleaned sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38) and quantified with Cellranger software (v3.0, 10× Genomics Inc.). Low-quality cells and potential doublets were filtered using the DoubletFinder R package (v2.0.3). Quality control and normalization were conducted using the Seurat R package (v4.4.0). The filtered matrix was normalized and scaled based on the top 2000 highly variable genes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed, and the top 30 principal components were selected for unsupervised clustering. Clustering was visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). A shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph-based clustering algorithm (original Louvain, resolution = 1.5) was applied to group single cells. Marker genes for each cluster were identified using the ‘FindAllMarkers’ function in Seurat. Additional analyses, including differential expression, functional enrichment, trajectory inference, and cell-cell communication were performed using FindMarkers (Seurat, v4.4.0), clusterProfile (v4.10.0), Monocle3 (v1.0.0), and CellChat (v1.6.1) R packages. For the scTCR-seq data, Cell Ranger software (v3.0, 10× Genomics Inc.) was utilized to align sequencing reads to the human VDJ reference genome (GRCh38). In TCR analysis, γδ T cells were classified based on the expression of γ or δ chains. Cells expressing both γδ and αβ chains were labeled based on the chains with higher UMI counts. For clonal expansion analysis, only cells with identical paired α and β chains were considered for each sample and assigned the same clone ID. The Single T cell Analysis by RNA-seq and TCR Tracking (Startrac) R package (v0.1.0) was used to calculate Shannon entropy at different levels, quantifying the magnitude of clonal expansion and TCR repertoire sharing across samples. Preparation of tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) Freshly collected tumor tissues of HCC patients, with or without HAIC treatment prior to resection were cut into small pieces and immersed in DMEM for 30–60 s. The supernatants were then collected, centrifuged at 1000g for 15 min, filtrated, and stored at −80°C until further use. T cell isolation and culture Leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. 70 5 Flow cytometry For surface staining, in vitro Quantification and statistical analysis Data analysis and visualization were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (v25), GraphPad Prism (v8.0.2) and R (v4.2.2). Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and statistical comparisons of survival were conducted using the log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Group comparisons were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test, or the Wilcoxon test for paired test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Correlations were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Error bars represent the median with interquartile range (IQR). A p p p p p p p References 1 Vogel A. Meyer T. Sapisochin G.
