Although the risk factors for AE-IP have been extensively studied, given the small sample sizes, only a few risk factors have been established. This study aimed to investigate the postoperative mortality and factors associated with AE-IP. Methods This retrospective study included 482 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of IP who underwent noncardiac surgery between December 2012 and April 2020. AE-IP was diagnosed by a radiologist using computed tomography when worsening respiratory symptoms were observed within 1 month postoperatively. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare mortality rates. Candidate factors associated with AE-IP were identified through logistic regression analysis using the variable selection method, followed by case-control analysis using propensity score matching to determine possible factors associated with AE-IP. Results The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause and IP-related deaths were significantly higher in patients with AE-IP than in those without AE-IP. Multivariable analysis with variable selection suggested that male sex, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 2 2 Conclusions Intraoperative management with FiO 2 C-reactive protein General surgery Interstitial pneumonia Lung diseases Mortality Oxygen Surgery Symptom flare up pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Interstitial pneumonia (IP) has an incidence of 5.6 per 100 000 person-years and an annual cumulative prevalence of approximately 18 per 100 000 people [ 1 2 5 3 5 18 6 6 Materials and Methods The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, approved this observational retrospective study (research approval number: 2019-251) on August 5, 2020, and the need for individual written informed consent was waived due to its retrospective design. This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, 2013 and reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. Overall, 492 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of IP who underwent noncardiac surgery at Kyushu University Hospital between December 2012 and April 2020 were included in this study. IP was either already diagnosed and followed up by a respiratory physician or incidentally diagnosed by a radiologist on preoperative CT. After excluding five patients aged < 18 years and five identical patients, 482 participants were enrolled in this study. None of the participants had preoperative AE-IP. We extracted surgery and anesthesia data from the participants’ electronic anesthetic charts and preoperative, postoperative, and survival data were collected manually by reviewing each participant’s electronic medical records individually. Data on sex, age, height, weight, Brinkman index (calculated by multiplying the number of cigarettes by the number of years), preoperative supplemental oxygen, and preoperative ventilator use were collected for the study participants. Additionally, we collected data on KL-6, CRP, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels; percent vital capacity (%VC); and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) on spirometry measured within 1 month preoperatively. The following surgical and anesthesia data were collected: type of surgery (lung surgery or other), anesthesia method (general or local anesthesia), presence of differential lung ventilation, surgery duration, anesthesia duration, urine volume, blood loss volume, infusion volume, in-out balance, volume of oxygen used, presence of intraoperative blood transfusion, and duration of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 2 2 9 2 2 2 The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of postoperative AE-IP. We defined AE-IP as the worsening of respiratory symptoms within 1 month postoperatively, with an AE-IP diagnosis confirmed by a radiologist on CT. Postoperative mortality information was collected from medical records, and the association between AE-IP and postoperative mortality was examined. AE-IP-related deaths were defined as deaths for which IP was listed as the cause of mortality in the medical record. The follow-up period for death was calculated from the date of surgery to the date of death confirmed in the medical record or to the last date recorded (e.g., the date of the last outpatient visit). Statistical analysis The baseline characteristics of the participants in the AE and non-AE groups were compared. Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or median (Q1, Q3) values and categorical variables as percentages. We used the Student’s t U 2 Results Baseline characteristics of participants Of the 482 participants included in the analysis, 19 developed AE-IP postoperatively. Participants who had AE-IP were more likely to be male. The mean values for weight, median values for KL-6 and CRP levels, and frequencies of FiO 2 Table 1 Supplementary Table 1 Crude cumulative survival rates The median (Q1, Q3) follow-up periods for the AE and non-AE groups were 212 (29, 550) and 729 (306, 1702) days, respectively. During the follow-up period, 10 and 119 patients died in the AE and non-AE groups, respectively. Additionally, five and 28 IP-related deaths occurred in the AE and non-AE groups, respectively ( Table 2 Fig. 1 Hazard ratios for all-cause and IP-related deaths in the AE and non-AE groups The crude HR for all-cause death was significantly higher in the AE group (HR: 4.82, 95% CI [2.51−9.26]) than in the non-AE group. In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, this association remained significant even after adjusting for potential confounding factors (HR: 5.16, 95% CI [2.62−10.14]). Similar results were observed for IP-related deaths. Odds ratios for AE-IP in the crude and variable selection analyses The crude OR for AE-IP was higher in males (OR: 10.64, 95% CI [2.17−192.15]) than in females, and higher CRP levels significantly increased the risk of AE-IP (OR: 1.12, 95% CI [1.03−1.22]). Multivariable analysis using the variable selection method showed that the candidate factors associated with AE-IP were male sex, higher CRP levels, FiO 2 2 Table 3 2 2 Supplementary Table 2 Table 3 2 2 Fig. 2 Supplementary Fig. 1 Case-control analysis using propensity score matching Multivariable analysis using the variable selection method was used to detect candidate factors associated with AE-IP. However, since many variables existed for the number of AE-IP cases, a case-control analysis was subsequently performed using propensity score matching. After matching with the propensity scores created using potential confounding factors previously reported as AE-IP risk factors and three additional factors other than CRP, CRP levels were significantly higher in the AE group than in the non-AE group (P = 0.044). Similarly, for FiO 2 2 Table 4 Discussion In this study, we found that postoperative AE-IP was associated with a higher risk of mortality, particularly IP-related deaths. Furthermore, variable selection analysis showed higher CRP levels, male sex, non-lung surgery, and FiO 2 2 2 The frequency of postoperative AE-IP in this study was 3.9%. Although various values for this incidence have been reported, 3.9% is generally consistent with previous reports [ 9 10 15 19 20 2 2 Although many studies on risk factors for AE-IP exist, only a few have focused on FiO 2 2 2 21 22 21 22 23 2 2 24 2 A large multicenter study involving 1763 patients at 61 centers found that a history of AE-IP, male sex, preoperative steroid use, high KL6 levels, and low %VC were significantly associated with AE-IP [ 6 2 19 Several previous reports, despite their small sample sizes, have reported high CRP levels as a risk factor for postoperative AE-IP, which is consistent with the findings of this study [ 7 10 13 16 22 10 6 19 4 25 Strengths and limitations Our results are valuable because this is the first study that uses appropriate statistical methods to show that intraoperative FiO 2 However, a limitation of this study is that even though the number of participants was large for a single center, it was not sufficient to identify all the factors associated with AE-IP, as previously noted. Second, even though the risk estimates were adjusted for possible confounding factors, residual confounders may exist. Third, as this was an observational study, the FiO 2 2 2 2 2 In conclusion, this study demonstrates that, in addition to elevated preoperative CRP levels, anesthesia management with a higher FiO 2 We would like to express our deepest appreciation to Mrs. Yoko Kondo, who works at the Kyushu University Hospital, for her assistance in this study.
