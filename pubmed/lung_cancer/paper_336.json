The cGAS-STING pathway is a critical innate immune sensor that induces inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, as well as type 1 and 2 IFNs, in response to foreign DNA ( 48 IL6 TNFA IFNB Figure 2A Figure 2, B–D Supplemental Figure 2 + Figure 2, E–G To assess APC recruitment and activation in draining lymph nodes after vaccination, we isolated inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) from mice 24 hours after subcutaneous vaccination in the flank with three CNPs: Pa-STING, Pa-PLGA (nonadjuvanted FDA approved polymer control), and RBC-STING (no OMV control) ( Figure 3A Supplemental Figure 3 Figure 3, B–E + Figure 3, C–G Figure 2 We next evaluated the safety and efficacy of Pa-STING vaccination in murine models. Mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with 3 doses of 1 μg RBC-STING or Pa-STING on days 0, 7, and 14 and monitored for safety and tolerability ( Figure 4A Supplemental Figure 4A Supplemental Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 4 Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Figure 4 49 Supplemental Figure 4 Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Figure 5 Supplemental Figure 6 Pa-STING vaccination protects against P. aeruginosa pneumonia morbidity and mortality.

Artificial sputum media (ASM) is a culture medium designed to mimic the physiologic environment of the CF lung. ASM contains amino acids, mucin, and extracellular DNA, and it induces altered secondary metabolite production in P aeruginosa 50 Supplemental Figure 10 Supplemental Figure 10G P aeruginosa To test the protective capacity of these antibodies, we passively transferred pre- and postvax Pa-STING sera into mice and infected them intratracheally with PA14 2 days later ( Figure 6G Figure 6, H and I Figure 6J P aeruginosa Discussion P. aeruginosa 51 53 P aeruginosa 53 P aeruginosa A baumannii 34 P aeruginosa Proper adjuvant selection is critical for vaccine design, as adjuvants can bias the immune response to either enhance or decrease protective immunity ( 54 44 45 P aeruginosa 43 46 47 55 P aeruginosa 56 58 Pa-STING vaccination induced significantly higher recruitment of B cells, DCs, and macrophages in the ILNs 24 hours after vaccination compared with RBC-STING and nonadjuvanted Pa-PLGA controls. Moreover, Pa-STING significantly enhanced the activation of CD11c + P aeruginosa P aeruginosa P aeruginosa Despite its considerable impact on global health, no vaccine against P aeruginosa 56 59 61 P aeruginosa 62 P aeruginosa 63 P aeruginosa P aeruginosa Beyond its high prevalence as an etiologic agent of hospital- and ventilator-associated pneumonia, P aeruginosa 64 42 65 66 67 P aeruginosa P aeruginosa 40 41 68 69 A vaccine targeting P aeruginosa 70 72 P aeruginosa 50 Importantly, Pa-STING postvaccination rabbit sera retained opsonophagocytic activity against PA14 cultured in ASM and against clinical CF isolates. Moreover, passive immunization with Pa-STING sera conferred protection in mice challenged with ASM-grown PA14. These results suggest that growth in ASM does not substantially alter the antigenic composition of OMVs. Future studies will explore Pa-STING vaccination efficacy following pneumonia challenge in immunocompromised and aged murine models. In summary, Pa-STING represents a highly effective CNP vaccine candidate capable of protecting against P aeruginosa Methods Sex as a biological variable Our study included both male and female mice, as well as healthy human neutrophils isolated from consenting male and female donors. Comparable results were observed across sexes in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Bacterial strains and cultures PA14 was isolated from a burn wound patient at a hospital in Pennsylvania ( 73 74 galU tns-ins 75 600 Artificial Sputum Media (ASM) ASM base media was prepared with 5 g/L gastric mucin (Pfaltz & Baue, # M32610 76 Pa-OMV derivation. Single colonies of PA14 were inoculated into 1 L flasks of LB or 100 mL ASM and grown at 37°C with aeration for 16–20 hours. Stationary phase cultures were spun down at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes in a Sorvall RC-6 refrigerated floor centrifuge. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm PES vacuum filter (Thermo Fisher, 167-0045) and concentrated ~ 100 x by tangential flow filtration (Repligen). Pa-OMVs were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g RBC membrane derivation Mouse RBC membranes were derived according to established protocols ( 77 78 2 g 2 g 2 Au-NP, PLGA, and STING synthesis Gold (Au-NP) cores. Citrate stabilized 30-nm AuNPs (NanoComposix, AUCN30) were mixed with RBC membranes or Pa-OMVs at a 1:1 weight ratio and bath sonicated for 2 minutes, as previously described ( 34 2 g PLGA polymers. PLGA (poly DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymers (50:50 PLGA, 0.67 dL/g; Lactel Absorbable Polymers) were created by rapid addition of PLGA at 10 mg/mL in acetone to equivalent volumes of water. Acetone was vacuum evaporated and resulting particles were resuspended at 10 mg/mL in dH 2 STING polymers. DSPE-H 11 11 2 11 11 g Pa-STING characterization Nanoparticle and OMV size, polydispersity index, and charge were assessed by dynamic light scattering (Malvern Zetasizer) with a refractive index of 2, dispersant as water. Stability was assessed by repeated DLS measurements over a 2-week period during storage at 4°C. Cytotoxicity. BMDC (DC2.4, Sigma SCC142), A549 (ATCC, CCL-185), and human lung microvascular endothelial cell viability (Sigma, 540-05A) were evaluated by incubating increasing concentrations of Pa-PLGA and Pa-STING in 96 well plates at 37°C, 5% CO 2 TEM. 5 μg/mL Pa-OMVS were laid on a Pelco EasiGLow-hydrophilized 400 mesh Formvar/Carbon-coated copper grid (0.1754-F, Electron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate (EM Sciences, USA). 5 μL of Pa-STING were laid on a nonhydrophilized 400 mesh Formvar/Carbon-coated copper grid (0.1754-F, Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed by 3 30-second wash steps with distilled water and air dry. All samples were imaged under a JEOL JEM-1400Plus transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). DC activation qRT-PCR. 24 hours after seeding in 24-well tissue culture treated plates, BMDCs (DC2.4, Sigma, SCC142) were stimulated with 5 μg/mL RBC-PLGA, RBC-STING, Pa-PLGA, Pa-STING, or left unstimulated. After 20–24 hours, the supernatant was aspirated, and RNA was isolated from cells with RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) with gDNA elimination according to the manufacturer’s protocols. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA (iScript gDNA Clear cDNA Synthesis Kit, BioRad). Quantitative real time PCR was run on a BioRad CFX96 with Perfecta SYBRMix (Quantabio). Fold change was determined using the 2ΔΔCt method with GAPDH as a housekeeping gene.

LPS antibody depletion was performed according to the method by Zollinger et al ( 79 Pseudomonas Murine studies All animal studies were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, applicable federal regulations, and the recommendations for care and use of laboratory animals instituted by the UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All protocols were IACUC approved (#S00227M). Mice were housed in a specific pathogen free (SPF) on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Mice received 2020X diet (Envigo), acidified water, and were housed in prebedded corn cob disposable cages (Innovive). Vivarium staff randomized mice into cages no less than 72 hours prior to experimentation, with up to 5 mice per cage. Hematology and safety studies 4–5 week-old C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs, 000664) were subcutaneously (SC) vaccinated with 1 μg RBC-STING or Pa-STING on days 0, 7, and 14. A comprehensive hematology panel was assessed on days –6, 1, 15, 28, and 42. Blood was obtained by mandibular cheek-bleeding from half of the cohort into lavender K 2 Comprehensive serum chemistry and hematology. 4–5 week-old male and female mice were vaccinated SC with 1 μg RBC-STING or Pa-STING on days 0, 7, and 14. Mice were infected with 0.5–2 × 10 7 Histopathology. Mice were vaccinated and treated as above. 20–24 hours postinfection, mice were humanely euthanized and the lungs were perfused with 10% formalin (Fisher, SF93-4). Lungs, liver, spleen, heart, thymus, adrenal glands, sternum, and kidneys were removed and fixed for 24 hours in 10% formalin, rinsed and stored to 70% EtOH prior to paraffin-block embedding, sectioning, and H&E staining by the UCSD Biorepository and Tissue Technology Shared Resources. Sections were blindly scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Infection models 8–12 week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with 0.5–2 × 10 7 7 2 CFUs, BAL. 20–24 hours p.i., mice were humanely euthanized. Bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was collected in 1 × PBS supplemented with 2 mM EDTA. Lungs were harvested, homogenized, and plated for enumeration. BAL was spun at 1,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C to pellet infiltrating cells. IL1-β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were assessed in BAL supernatant by ELISA DuoSet according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems). The BAL cell pellet was resuspended in 1 x PBS and counted by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were stained for the following cell markers CD3 (BD, 560591), CD11c, Siglec F (Biolegend, 155506), CD11b (Invitrogen, RM2828), Ly6G (Biolegend, 127614), MHCII (Biolegend, 107652), CD19 (BD557398), and Live/Dead Aqua for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed, fixed, and run on a BD FACS Canto II. Gates were drawn using single-stained, unstained, and FMO controls. Single color compensation was performed. A gating strategy is depicted in Supplemental Figure 8 80 Histopathology. 20–24 hours p.i., mice were humanely euthanized and the lungs were perfused with 10% formalin, fixed, embedded, mounted, stained, and scored as described above. Passive immunization 8–12 week-old C57BL/6 mice were passively immunized intravenously (retroorbitally) with 200 μL prevax or postvax rabbit sera (AbCore) with brief anesthesia by inhaled isoflurane. Mice were monitored until fully recovered from anesthesia. 48 or 72 hours after vaccination, mice were infected intratracheally with ~ 0.5–1 × 10 7 7 STING vaccination 4–5 week-old B6 mice were vaccinated with 0.01, 0.1, or 1 μg RBC-STING or Pa-STING subcutaneously after brief anesthesia with inhaled isoflurane on days 0, 7, and 14. For dosing experiments, mice that received 1 or 2 doses received RBC-STING in lieu of Pa-STING. Weights and IgG antibody titers were assessed on days 0, 7, 14, and 28 by mandibular cheek bleeding and ELISA. Mice were infected on day 28 with ~ 1 × 10 7 ILN vaccination 6–7 week-old B6 mice were vaccinated with 0.1 μg RBC-STING, Pa-PLGA, or Pa-STING subcutaneously in the flank after brief anesthesia with isoflurane. 24 hours postvaccination, mice were humanely sacrificed, and inguinal lymph nodes were harvested. Lymph nodes were processed for single-cell isolation and stained for surface markers of antigen presenting cells CD19 (BD, 557398), CD11c, and F4/80 as well as the activation markers CD40, CD80, CD86, Cells were also stained with Live/Dead Aqua and Mouse FC Block. Cells were run on a BD FACS Canto II and analysis was performed using FlowJo. Gates were drawn with single-stained, unstained, and FMO controls. Single color compensation was performed. A gating strategy is depicted in Supplemental Figure 3 Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v10 based on the recommendation of a statistician.
