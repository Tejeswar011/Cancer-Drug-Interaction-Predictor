Many malignancies arise in the context of chronic infection, persistent irritation, or unresolved inflammation, and the inflammatory environment is closely associated with tumor cell proliferation and metastatic spread. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), calculated from peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, has been investigated as a prognostic biomarker in several solid tumors, but its role in melanoma is not well defined. Data from the 2003–2018 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between SII and melanoma. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to sex, age, marital status, body mass index, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking status. A cross-sectional study including 39,200 participants from eight NHANES cycles (2003–2018) was conducted, and logistic regression was applied to quantify the association between SII and melanoma. After categorizing SII into tertiles, the unadjusted model indicated that individuals in the highest tertile had a 57% higher melanoma risk compared with those in the lowest tertile (OR = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.06–2.34; p = 0.024). After adjusting for potential confounders, the highest SII tertile remained associated with a 48% increased risk (OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01–2.01; p = 0.047). Higher SII levels were also significantly associated with increased risk in the hypercholesterolemia subgroup (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.08–1.64; p = 0.008). These findings indicate a moderate positive association between SII and melanoma incidence, suggesting that SII may be a simple and accessible biomarker for early detection. To address the limitations of cross-sectional analysis, an external validation cohort was established at our tertiary oncology center. Between 2017 and 2018, 101 pathologically confirmed melanoma patients and 207 contemporaneous non-melanoma controls were recruited. In multivariable logistic regression, the highest SII tertile was associated with a 2.6-fold higher melanoma risk compared with the lowest tertile (OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 1.19–5.69; p = 0.017). These external data support SII as a potential indicator of melanoma risk; however, further validation in prospective cohort studies is required. inflammation systemic immune-inflammation index tumors metastasis and inhibition melanoma early indicators are studied The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Skin Cancer 1 Introduction Melanoma is a malignant tumor that originates from skin melanocytes ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The etiology of melanoma is multifactorial, involving factors such as racial background, germline mutations, dietary habits, obesity, advanced age, and smoking ( 4 10 11 12 13 14 17 14 18 21 22 23 24 The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a novel composite marker calculated using peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts ( 13 25 2 Methods 2.1 Data and sample source The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a population-based national survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The survey collects a wide range of health and nutrition data using a multi-stage probability sampling design. The NCHS Institutional Review Board approved the survey protocol, and informed consent was obtained from each participant. NHANES data include demographic information, dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory test results. For this study, we used data from eight NHANES cycles (2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2011–2012, 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018), which also include data on SII, melanoma, and related variables.   Figure 1 Figure 1 Flowchart of the study population from NHANES 2003–2018. Flowchart depicting data screening from NHANES 2003 to 2018, starting with 80,312 participants. After removing 14,444 due to incomplete systemic immune-inflammation index data, 65,868 remain. An additional 26,668 are excluded for missing education level, body mass index, albumin, and other data, resulting in 39,200 participants. To corroborate the NHANES findings, 308 consecutive patients who presented to our tertiary oncology center between January 2017 and December 2018 and whose diagnoses were histopathologically confirmed were retrospectively enrolled. Eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) first-time histopathologic diagnosis of primary melanoma (n = 101) or non-melanoma neoplasm (n = 207); (2) peripheral blood counts obtained within one week prior to diagnosis; and (3) availability of complete clinical and laboratory data. Patients who had received any prior systemic therapy were excluded. 2.2 Exposure and outcome assessment Lymphocyte (LYM), neutrophil (NEU), and platelet (PLT) counts (expressed as ×10 3 2.3 Covariates Age, sex, race (American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and other races), family income-to-poverty ratio (PIR) (<1.3, 1.3–3.5, and >3.5), education level (less than high school, high school, and above high school), and body mass index (BMI) (<25, 25–30, and >30 kg/m²) are included as covariates. Smoking status is categorized as non-smokers and smokers. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes are assessed based on prior physician diagnoses. Cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are also considered. Marital status is classified as “yes” for individuals with a history of marriage. Participants are defined as smokers if they answer “yes” to the question “Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” Those who currently smoke and answer “yes” to the question “Do you currently smoke?” are also classified as smokers. 3 Statistical analysis In accordance with NHANES analytic guidelines, new sample weights were recalculated when data from two or more cycles were pooled, to account for the complex multistage stratified sampling design. The single-center external validation cohort (n = 308) was accrued by consecutive convenience sampling, and no survey weights were applied. In this study, data from the 2003–2018 NHANES cycles are merged, and descriptive variables are presented as percentages of the number of participants. Therefore, weighted values are used in the analysis. Continuous variables are presented as medians [interquartile range] and compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test; categorical variables are shown as n (%) and compared with the χ 2 A logistic regression model is employed to assess the association between SII and melanoma. In logistic regression, a one-unit change in the independent variable typically results in a small and often difficult-to-detect change in the outcome (Y) or in the strength of association. To enhance the model’s ability to detect associations, SII values are categorized into tertiles, with the lowest tertile serving as the reference group. Results are reported as odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values. Model 1 includes no adjustments for potential confounders. Model 2 is adjusted for sex, age, education level, marital status, and annual family income. Model 3 is further adjusted for body mass index (BMI), hypercholesterolemia, smoking status, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and triglyceride levels. To explore potential effect modifiers, subgroup analyses are conducted according to sex, age, marital status, BMI, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking status. A two-tailed p-value of <0.05 is considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses are performed using Stata, R, and Epi Info software. 4 Results This study is the first to systematically investigate the association between the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and melanoma. A cross-sectional analysis is conducted using data from 39,200 participants in the NHANES cycles from 2003 to 2018 to explore the relationship between SII levels and melanoma risk. The main findings are as follows:(1) Age, race, educational attainment, marital status, family income, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking status, and blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine are all associated with the occurrence of melanoma.(2) Females are more likely to exhibit higher SII levels than males, and individuals with melanoma tend to be older than those without the disease.(3) After adjusting for confounding factors, a positive association remains between elevated SII levels and melanoma risk, although the strength of the association is slightly attenuated compared to the unadjusted model.(4) Subgroup and interaction analyses indicate that high SII levels are significantly associated with an increased incidence of melanoma, and this relationship is not significantly modified by age, race, education level, family income, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or smoking status. A major strength of this study is the external validation using a 308-patient retrospective cohort from our institution (2017–2018), which complements the NHANES analysis. Although the observation period was limited, all patients were managed at a single tertiary referral center with standardized pathological review and treatment protocols, thereby reducing heterogeneity related to geography or practice patterns. In the validation cohort, participants in the highest SII tertile had a 2.6-fold higher risk of melanoma compared with those in the lowest tertile, a finding that closely paralleled the 48% increased risk observed in NHANES. These results suggest that SII is a consistent indicator of melanoma risk across time and populations.

The plot indicates statistical significance with p-values less than 0.05 in several categories. To corroborate the NHANES findings, 308 patients managed at our tertiary oncology center between January 2017 and December 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Eligibility criteria included (1) histopathological confirmation of primary cutaneous melanoma or non-melanoma skin lesions at initial diagnosis, and (2) availability of a complete blood count within one week before diagnosis. A total of 101 melanoma cases and 207 non-melanoma controls were included. SII values were categorized into tertiles, and associations were assessed using the same three sequential models. In Model 1 (unadjusted), participants in the highest SII tertile had a 1.5-fold higher risk of melanoma compared with those in the lowest tertile (OR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.41–5.23; p = 0.003).

To further assess the robustness of this finding, we retrospectively enrolled 101 patients with primary cutaneous melanoma and 207 non-melanoma controls diagnosed at our institution between 2017 and 2018. External validation yielded an odds ratio of 2.60 (95 % CI 1.19–5.69; p = 0.017) for the highest SII tertile, a result that closely mirrors both the direction and magnitude observed in NHANES, suggesting that the prognostic utility of SII as a melanoma risk indicator may be generalizable across time, geography, and health-care systems. As a highly malignant skin-derived tumor, melanoma is closely associated with the body’s inflammatory and immune status throughout its initiation and progression ( 22 14 The aging population has contributed to a general increase in the overall incidence of skin cancers. As age increases, the incidence of melanoma has also risen, which aligns with the findings of this study. In this study, the average age of individuals diagnosed with melanoma was significantly higher than that of those without melanoma. Furthermore, chronic inflammation, linked to the aging process, is likely a major factor in cancer development. Inflammatory processes induce oxidative stress and decrease the cell’s antioxidant capacity ( 31 32 Skin cancer is less prevalent in ethnic groups other than Caucasians, as these populations generally have higher epidermal melanin concentrations, which provide protection against sun-induced skin damage ( 7 The strengths of this study include (1) the broad coverage and national representativeness of NHANES data, (2) external validation in a 308-patient institutional cohort, and (3) adjustment for key potential confounders, including age, education, BMI, smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, within multivariable models. Several limitations should be acknowledged: (1) both NHANES and the institutional cohort relied on cross-sectional or retrospective designs, which preclude causal inference; (2) important covariates—including tumor stage, histologic subtype, ultraviolet exposure, genetic mutations, and C-reactive protein—were unavailable; (3) statistical power was limited by the relatively small number of melanoma cases (249 in NHANES and 101 in the institutional cohort); and (4) self-reported BMI and smoking status may have introduced recall and social-desirability biases. In summary, melanoma typically develops insidiously. In its early stages, due to the lack of distinct external signs, low incidence, limited early detection methods, and the challenges in their widespread implementation, patients often overlook the early progression of melanoma, leading to missed or misdiagnosed cases. Therefore, we obtain the Systemic Inflammation Index (SII) using a simple and practical approach, a complete blood count. According to the findings of this study, the SII value may reflect systemic inflammation associated with the mechanisms underlying melanoma development. However, the use of SII as an early detection marker for melanoma requires further validation through prospective cohort studies.
