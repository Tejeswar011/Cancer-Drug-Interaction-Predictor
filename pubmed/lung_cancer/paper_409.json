The TME consists of extracellular matrix, stromal cells, and immune cells, and regulates infiltration of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, which are critical players in immunotherapeutic responses. The TME exhibits three distinct phenotypes distinguished by immune cell presence and distribution: immune desert (absent cytotoxic T lymphocytes), immune excluded (peripheral presence without infiltration), and immune inflamed (substantial infiltration). These phenotypes strongly correlate with immunotherapy response outcomes 26 27 28 29 Within the TME, the ECM orchestrates immune cell activation, differentiation, and infiltration 24 25 30 31 32 35 31 36 40 41 43 41 42 44 45 46 49 MRI is a clinical imaging modality and provides three-dimensional images of soft tissues, including tumors, with high spatial resolution. It is routinely used for cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and image-aided precision cancer therapy, including immunotherapy. However, the potential of MRI is limited by the lack of a targeted contrast agent that can characterize tumor responses to immunotherapies. We have developed a small peptide targeted MRI contrast agent, ZD2-N3-Gd(HP-DO3A) or MT218, specific to EDB-FN for magnetic resonance molecular imaging (MRMI) of cancer 50 Figure 1 51 41 43 52 53 54 56 NCT06262139 57 Here, we demonstrate how MT218-MRMI predicts tumor responses to three immunotherapeutic approaches in an orthotopic, allograft-based murine model of PDAC: a VISTA-blocking mAb 15 16 G12D 5 58 59 Figure 1 Results MRMI for monitoring and prediction of tumor responses to anti-VISTA mAb therapy To investigate how VISTA blockade influences immunotherapy-induced changes in EDB-FN expression, we established an orthotopic PDAC model using KPC-K8484 cells implanted in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Following the experimental schedule shown in Figure 2 Figure 2 1 Mice were treated either with saline (100 µL, negative control) or anti-VISTA mAb (200 µg in 100 µL) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection three times a week for a total of four weeks starting on day 12. T 1 2 Figure S1 Figure 2 Figure S1 In comparison, anti-VISTA mAb elicited heterogeneous responses among treated mice. Outcomes were characterized by primary tumor size, metastatic tumor presence, and post-contrast signal enhancement pattern. Of 14 treated mice (6 female, 8 male), eight exhibited a non-responder phenotype of large tumors with low contrast enhancement comparable to controls and widespread metastases ( Figure 2 Figure 2 MT218-MRMI assessment of SD mice showed greater signal enhancement in tumor periphery and moderate tumor core signal on day 28 and 46, indicative of augmented EDB-FN expression within these tumors. Quantitative analysis found that MT218 produced a 3- to 6-fold increase in average normalized contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) across all tumors compared to pre-treatment (day 10, Figure S2 Figure S3 Histological analysis was performed at days 28 and 46 (post-MRMI) or at humane endpoint to characterize treatment responses. IHC using anti-EDB-FN (G4) mAb revealed distinct staining patterns of EDB-FN expression in the tumors across treatment groups: control tumors showed heterogeneous, moderate EDB-FN staining ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed distinct histopathological features among treatment groups. Specifically, control and non-responding tumors showed dense adenocarcinoma with minimal pancreatic tissue remnants and little core necrosis (Figure 2 Figure 2 T cell infiltration patterns determined tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) phenotypes in response to immunotherapy and were used in tandem with other prognostic factors to predict therapeutic response. Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) imaging to determine T cell infiltration patterns in response to immunotherapy.

Mice bearing orthotopic KPC tumors were treated with a cocktail of KRAS G12D Figure 4 Figure S7 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Quantitative analysis showed significantly elevated CNR in complete responders by day 28 (6.46-fold vs pre-treatment 3.57-fold, Figure S8 Histological analysis of vaccine-treated tissues at day 46 validated MRMI findings across response groups ( Figure 4 Figure 4 62 + + Figure 4 + + Response assessment on day 28 demonstrated MT218-MRMI's predictive capability.

Following the procedure outlined in Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure S9 Figure 6 Figure S10 Figure 6 Figure S10 Figure 6 Figure S10 Following the final MRMR scan on day 45, mice were euthanized, and tumor and pancreatic tissue was harvested. IHC, H&E, and IF tissue analysis validated MT218-MRMI findings ( Figure 6 Figure 6 + + Figure 6 + + Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 5 Figure 7 Figure 7 + + Figure 7 + + Predicting long-term therapeutic outcomes with MRMI Using early-stage MT218-MRMI signal data, we developed a Cox proportional hazards model to classify therapeutic outcomes in PDAC-bearing mice. Imaging analysis identified distinct response patterns differing in signal enhancement and immune characteristics. Non-responders exhibited low MRMI signal enhancement throughout tumors, corresponding to an immune desert TME, rapid tumor growth, and metastasis. SD cases showed bright tumor periphery with moderate core enhancement, reflecting an immune excluded TME and rapid tumor growth without metastasis. Partial responders displayed bright tumor periphery with weaker core enhancement, also indicating an immune excluded TME but with inhibited tumor growth and no metastasis. Finally, complete responders demonstrated uniform bright enhancement throughout the tumor, correlating with an immune inflamed TME and no detectable tumor or metastasis. To validate this classification model, we analyzed a larger cohort of PDAC-bearing mice treated with saline (control n = 20-29, dependent on group), anti-VISTA mAb (n = 14), vaccine (n = 27), or combination (n = 28) therapy, evaluating MT218-MRMI's ability to detect early changes at 2 weeks post-treatment and predict long-term outcomes. The model achieved 82.9% overall accuracy in predicting tumor growth and survival outcomes, with treatment-specific accuracies of 100% for saline control, 76.9% for vaccine treatment, and 71.4% for combination therapy. Notably, the model showed perfect prediction accuracy for both complete responders and non-responders (100%), with reduced accuracy for partial responders (22.2%). Survival analysis extending to 200 days post-treatment revealed distinct patterns across treatment groups ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 These results demonstrate that MT218-MRMI effectively monitors tumor immunotherapy response through distinct enhancement patterns correlating with immune activation, TME characteristics, and long-term survival outcomes. The high overall accuracy of the classification model, 82.9%, particularly in identifying complete responders and non-responders, supports MT218-MRMI's potential as a predictive imaging tool for monitoring and predicting immunotherapy outcomes. Discussion Despite significant advances, existing clinical imaging tools remain limited in assessment of immunotherapy response, particularly for pancreatic cancer. Enabling high resolution visualization of soft tissue with excellent sensitivity for pancreatic and PDAC tissue, MRMI is an ideal modality for accurate and non-invasive characterization of immunotherapy response 63 33 48 56 33 41 45 MRMI offers several unique advantages for high-resolution and dynamic characterization of TME changes at any tissue depth, making it particularly valuable for visualizing pancreatic tumors often obscured by surrounding organs. MT218-MRMI in particular revealed heterogeneous contrast enhancement patterns that reflect variable EDB-FN expression levels and distribution throughout immunotherapy treatment. MT218 generated strong signal enhancement 10-20 minutes post-injection, which gradually diminished over time. This gradual decline in signal intensity can be attributed to MT218's moderate binding affinity (K a 51 Immunotherapy efficacy depends on helper CD4 + + + + 31 36 40 et al. + + 45 Analysis at day 28 showed responding tumors with significant CD4 + + + + + + - + + Figure 9 Significant efforts are focused on developing molecular imaging tools to specifically target immune cell surface markers.

The KRAS G12D G12D G12D This investigation has several limitations. MRMI images and IHC/IF stains were not perfectly co-registered due to natural variation in the tissue handling process which resulted in tissue shrinkage and anatomical misalignment. These processing methods made it difficult to precisely correlate the MRMI data with activated T cells in the tumors. Future studies should consider the use of custom rigs in the MR bed and novel fixing methods to allow for improved co-registration. In addition, MRMI could not distinguish between activated CD4 + + Outlook MT218-MRMI is capable of monitoring immunotherapy responses through semi-quantitative imaging, as demonstrated here in PDAC. As an FDA-approved agent for cancer detection currently under clinical investigation 57 Methods Cell culture Murine Kras G12D/+ R172H/+ 2 Animals care and tumor model establishment Seven-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used for in vivo 2 3 3 Immunotherapy injections and formulation Five distinct groups of mice were utilized for this study: negative control (no surgery), positive control (surgery, i.p. saline dosed as a imaging control based on past precedent), anti-VISTA mAb-treated (ICI therapy, clone #13F3, BioXCell Inc, Lebanon, NH), peptide vaccine cocktail of (KRAS-G12D peptide (KLVVVGADGVGKSALTI) 5 Image acquisition A 3.0T small animal MRI scanner (MRS*DRYMAG, MR Solutions, Surrey, UK) with a short mouse coil was used to acquire all images. Images were acquired at four time points: prior to contrast injection (pre), 10 minutes post-contrast injection (10 min), 20 minutes post-contrast injection (20 min), and 30 minutes post-contrast injection (30 min). At each time point, a T 1 1 2 Image analysis Region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis was performed using FIJI open-source software ( https://imagej.net/contribute/citing 1 https://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Publications For coronal image analysis of T 2 https://horosproject.org/about/ Histological staining and grading Following euthanasia, tumors, livers, kidneys, and spleens were dissected and fixed in formalin for 24 hours. Tissues were then stored in 70% ethanol and labeled in cassettes. Histological staining was conducted by the tissue resource core at the Case Cancer Comprehensive Center. Tissues were sectioned at 5 µm and fixed to coverslip slides. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was conducted following standard procedure, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using an anti-G4 mAb (Absolute Antibody, Boston, MA) at a ratio of 1:100. Briefly, after deparaffinization, antigen retrieval was performed at 125 °C for 30 seconds in citrate buffer (pH = 6.0), followed by blocking with 3% H 2 2 Immunological assays Dual immunofluorescence (IF) staining was performed on OCT-embedded tissue sections. Samples were brought to room temperature, washed twice with PBS to remove OCT, and a hydrophobic barrier was drawn around the tissue sections. The tissue was fixed with 100-200 µL of ice-cold acetone per slide, incubated at -20 °C for 5-10 minutes, and washed three times with PBS. Blocking was performed for 30-60 minutes with 5% serum goat (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS-T (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS). A cocktail of primary antibodies with mouse reactivity, each raised in different species, was prepared in 1% serum in PBS-T.

Images were acquired at 10 minutes post-injection, as this time point provided optimal visualization of MT218 binding to EDB-FN. Enhancement patterns were quantified using a semi-automated region-of-interest (ROI) analysis to calculate signal-to-noise ratios and enhancement distribution metrics (peripheral:core ratio, uniformity index). The classification model incorporated both quantitative imaging features and histologically confirmed immune characteristics to categorize responses as non-responder, stable disease, partial response, or complete response. Model performance was evaluated through leave-one-out cross-validation in a cohort of 41 PDAC-bearing mice treated with saline (n = 14), VISTA (n = 10), vaccine (n = 13), or combination therapy (n = 14). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed with outcomes monitored for up to 200 days post-treatment, and statistical significance was assessed using log-rank tests. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to quantify treatment effects relative to saline controls. Classification accuracy was evaluated globally and by response category, with separate analyses for each treatment group to assess model robustness across different therapeutic interventions. Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism 9 and 10 were used for statistical analyses. Students t-test (two-tailed, unpaired) was employed for categorical variables. Two-way ANOVAs with Tukey's post hoc test was used longitudinal MRMI signal analysis between groups and for comparisons of outcomes between therapeutic groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized for survival studies. A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Supplementary Material Supplementary figures.
