Currently, LSC diagnosis primarily relies on clinical presentation, with histopathological examination performed when the diagnosis is unclear. However, the precise pathogenic mechanisms driving the disease remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the pathogenesis of LSC and evaluate the feasibility of tape stripping as a non-invasive diagnostic technique. Methods: Skin specimens were obtained using both traditional biopsy and tape stripping methods, and the metabolites and oxidized lipids in these samples were analyzed using advanced mass spectrometry techniques. Results: Our findings suggest that 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), an oxidized derivative of arachidonic acid (AA), activates the TRPV1 receptor, thereby exacerbating the itch–scratch cycle. This activation upregulates energy metabolism and promotes epidermal hyperplasia, providing new insights into the disease’s pathophysiology. Conclusions: Our study suggests that tape stripping could serve as a viable non-invasive diagnostic tool for LSC, with linoleic acid (LA) and AA potentially acting as biomarkers for the disease. vulvar lichen simplex chronicus (VLSC) tape stripping skin biopsy metabolomics TRPV1 20-HETE the Kuanren Talents Program of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University the Kuanren Innovation Team Program of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University the CQMU Program for Youth Innovation in Future Medicine W0174 the Construction of District-level Key Discipline in Public Health in Nan’an District, Chongqing the Chongqing Science & Technology Commission cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0213 Chongqing Municipal Education Commission KJZD-K202100407 the Senior Medical Talents Program of Chongqing for Young and Middle-aged [2022] 15 This work was supported by various programs associated with the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, including the Kuanren Talents Program of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, the Kuanren Innovation Team Program of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, and the CQMU Program for Youth Innovation in Future Medicine (W0174).

Introduction Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) of the vulva is a dermatological disease characterized by the process of lichenification, which involves the thickening and hardening of the skin due to persistent itchiness and scratching [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 Diagnosis of atypical LSC traditionally relies on invasive biopsy procedures to provide detailed histological insights into skin changes [ 5 7 8 9 10 The persistent itch–scratch cycle is believed to be the main cause of lichenification in LSC [ 11 11 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 In this study, we compare the metabolic profiles derived from skin biopsies and tape-stripped samples of patients with LSC using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to elucidate the underlying metabolic mechanisms in LSC [ 20 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Participants The initial cohort for this study comprised 36 female patients diagnosed with localized LSC. These patients were recruited from the gynecology outpatient clinic at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University during the period from 2021 to 2022. Metabolic data collected from these patients were employed to construct a predictive model using machine learning techniques. For independent validation of the constructed model, an additional cohort of 11 patients was subsequently recruited from the same clinic. Samples were collected from each participant using both tape stripping and biopsy procedures. From each individual, samples were obtained from the lesional skin, as well as from the adjacent normal skin, categorizing them into four distinct groups: lesional-skin tape stripping (LSC Tape), normal-skin tape stripping (NOR Tape), lesional-skin biopsy (LSC Biopsy), and normal-skin biopsy (NOR Biopsy). The LSC lesions were assessed according to the criteria proposed in 1990 by the International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease [ 21 2 All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Ethic #: 2021826). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study at enrollment. 2.2. Clinical Information Basic information (age, BMI, reproductive history, and disease duration) was collected from the electronic medical records. To avoid subjectivity and variability in assessments, this study employed Cattaneo clinical symptom and sign score to evaluate the intensity of itching, skin elasticity, color, and lesion area on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) for each parameter [ 22 Table S1 2.3. Tape and Skin Biopsy Sample Collections The overall experimental design is summarized in Figure 1 2.4. Hematoxylin–Eosin (H&E) Staining for Skin Biopsy Following the collection of skin biopsies, samples were excised, cleansed, and fixed in a 10% formalin solution at 4 °C for 24 h. After fixation, the samples underwent dehydration, were embedded in paraffin, and were sectioned into 5 µm slices. These sections were then stained with Hematoxylin–Eosin (H&E) and examined using an NLCD500 digital biological microscope (Jiangnan Yixin, Nanjing, China). 2.5. Sample Preparations for Skin Biopsy and Tape Stripping Specimen Vulvar biopsy tissue (~5 ± 1 mg) was weighed and placed in a 1.5 mL EP tube containing three magnetic beads and 400 µL of extraction solution (1:1 ratio of 1 M sodium hydroxide and methanol, 0.12 mM D4-alanine, and 0.12 mM D5-phenylalanine), followed by 1 min, 30 frequency/s oscillation in a tissue lyser (TissueLyser II, Qiagen, Hilden, German). Then, the supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (4 °C) for 15 min and transferred to a salinized tube prior to derivatization. The adhesive tape was placed in a 2 mL screw cap tube containing 800 µL of extraction solution (1:1 ratio of 1 M sodium hydroxide and methanol, 0.12 mM D4-alanine, and 0.12 mM D5-phenylalanine), followed by heating in a water bath for 25 min at 95 °C. Then the supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (4 °C) for 15 min and transferred to a salinized tube prior to derivatization. 2.6. Quality Control (QC) and Randmomization Twenty-seven quality control (QC) samples were prepared by pooling portions of the extracted supernatants and subsequently aliquoting the mixture into new tubes. These aliquots were utilized for two distinct experimental procedures: MCF derivatization and lipid oxidation studies. For every set of fifteen samples analyzed, one QC spectrum was acquired to ensure methodological consistency. The randomized ordering of the analysis of the samples was facilitated by the RANK function in Excel, guaranteeing an equal distribution of samples from the normal and abnormal groups for each pair of QC samples. 2.7. Methyl Chloroformate (MCF) Derivatization and Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) Analysis All extracts were subjected to chemical modification by methyl chloroformate (MCF) derivatization to reduce their boiling points, following the methodology described by Smart et al. [ 23 24 2.8. Metabolite Identification The chromatographic characteristics of metabolites were deconvoluted and identified using Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution & Identification System software. The metabolites were confirmed by matching both the in-house MCF library spectra > 85% and their respective GC retention times within a 30 s window. The identification of the remaining compounds was performed using a commercial National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectral library [ 25 2.9. Quantification of Metabolite Concentration Amino acids, fatty acids, and lactic acids were quantified using chemical standards. Levels of these metabolites were first normalized against the appropriate internal standard and then quantified to absolute concentration using calibration curves obtained with the corresponding chemical standard (five-concentration range from 0 to ~55.4 mM). 2.10. GC–MS Data Mining and Normalization The relative concentrations of metabolites were determined using an R-based script, MassOmics, which calculates peak heights of the most abundant fragment ions within specific retention times [ 26 27 2.11. Preparations of Calibration Standards, Internal Standards, and Antioxidants Stock solutions of oxylipin chemical standards were prepared at a concentration of 100 ng/μL in ethanol for all analytes except 9(10)-epoxyoctadecenoic acid, prostaglandin (PG) F1α, and 11-deoxy PGE1, which were dissolved in methanol. An intermediate stock solution containing the 43 analytes was prepared at 10 μg/μL for all standard compounds. From this intermediate stock solution, calibrator working solutions were derived through dilution with ethanol, achieving concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.2, 1, 5, and 20 ng/mL for all analytes. A mixture comprising five working internal standard (IS) solutions was prepared for each individual stock of internal standard to give a final concentration of 100 ng/mL in methanol and acetonitrile (1:1, v v v v v v 2.12. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) of Oxylipins from Biopsy Sample Equal quantities (8 ± 1 mg) of vulvar biopsy samples were weighed and placed in a 2 mL screw cap tube containing three magnetic beads and 270 µL of extraction solution (250 μL methanol, 10 μL antioxidant solution, and 10 μL IS), followed by 1 min of homogenization in a Tissue Lyser II (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Then, the supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (4 °C) for 20 min and transferred to a 5 mL screw cap prior to solid phase extraction (SPE). Oxylipins were extracted using Oasis HLB cartridge columns (30 mg, 1 cc, Waters, Wilmslow, UK) [ 28 v v 29 2.13. Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) Analysis The LC–MS/MS analysis employed an ultra-performance liquid chromatographic system (UPLC, Agilent 1260, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and electrospray ionization (ESI) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QqQ, Agilent 6460C, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A 10 μL portion of the extract was injected for analysis, with the autosampler maintained at 6 °C. Separation of analytes was accomplished using an Agilent Poroshell EC-C18 column (3.0 × 150 mm; 1.9 µm; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Mobile phase A consisted of water and acetic acid (100:0.1 v v v v 24 2.14. Machine Learning Development and Validation To select the most effective binary classification models for tape stripping and biopsy sampling, seven machine learning methods were evaluated, including artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), K nearest neighbor (KNN), naïve bayes (NB), logistics regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The workflow of machine learning is illustrated in Figure 1 2 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Accuracy = (TP + TN) = (TP + FP + TN + FN); Sensitivity = TP = (TP + FN); Specificity = TN = (TN + FP); F1 The discrimination ability of the models was displayed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the predicted models, where a higher AUC value signifies the superiority of the classifier [ 37 2.15. ELISA A direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique was employed, using kits from Ruixin Biotech (Quanzhou, China) for Human PLA2, Human arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), Human transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), and Human pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (M2-PK) and from UpingBio (Wuhan, China) for Human cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily a member 11 (CYP4A11) and Human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), following the manufacturers’ protocols. Protein standard solutions (50 μL) were dispensed into the standard wells, while each skin tissue sample (50 μL) was added to the assay wells on a 96-well microwell plate. Subsequently, 100 μL of specific labeled primary antibodies were added. After incubating for 60 min at 37 °C in a light-protected environment, the wells were washed, and a substrate mixture of 0.01% H 2 2 v v 450 2.16. Statistical Analysis Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was performed to compare global metabolomic profiles among four groups (LSC tape, NOR tape, LSC biopsy, and NOR biopsy) employing the MassOmics R package (Chongqing, China) [ 26 t 38 p https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool 39 40 41 42 https://www.omicshare.com/tools 43 3. Results 3.1. Clinical Characteristics The demographic and clinical characteristics of the initial 36 participants are described in Table S2 3.2. Morphological Evaluation of Skin Biopsy Samples for LSC The histopathological examination of the vulvar biopsy samples (LSC Biopsy) revealed characteristic features consistent with LSC, as shown in Figure 1 3.3. Overview of Changes in Metabolite Levels A total of 104 and 106 metabolites were identified in vulvar skin biopsy and tape stripping samples, respectively, using the in-house mass spectrometry library and the NIST commercial database. We performed a PLSDA depicted in Figure 2 3.4. Different Metabolite Levels in Biopsy and Tape Samples To examine the metabolic variations between the biopsy and tape groups, we utilized heatmaps, volcano plots, and box plots, as illustrated in Figure 2 Figure 2 p Figure 2 3.5. Machine Learning Algorithms for Disease Prediction This study aimed to determine metabolites that can discriminate between LSC skin and normal skin, various algorithms, including ANN, DT, KNN, LR, NB, RF, and SVM, were implemented. As a result of applying the machine learning algorithms to the classification of samples, a panel of 17 metabolites in tape samples and 23 in biopsy samples was identified. The contributions of these metabolites to the performance of each machine learning algorithm were ranked ( Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure S1 Figure 2 3.6. Metabolic Pathway Enrichment Analysis To further explore the biological role of differentially abundant metabolites, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis based on the KEGG metabolic network ( Figure 5 Figure 5 3.7. Correlation Between LSC-Related Metabolites and Severity of LSC (Cattaneo Scores) For both tape and biopsy samples, we conducted a standardized linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between differentially abundant LSC metabolites and the Cattaneo scores, as depicted in Figure 6 3.8. A Derive Oxylipin Profiling of LSC To investigate the downstream products of omega-6 fatty acids derived from linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, we also quantified 20 oxylipins in samples from both LSC and NOR groups ( Figure 7 Figure 7 44 45 Figure 7 4. Discussion Although alterations in skin metabolism are recognized to contribute to several chronic dermatological conditions, the specific metabolic shifts associated with LSC symptoms remain underexplored. In this study, we conducted a comparative metabolic analysis using skin secretion samples acquired via tape stripping and skin tissue biopsies from thirty-six female patients diagnosed with LSC, aiming to identify potential biomarkers for the disease and elucidate its pathogenesis. Our findings revealed significant elevations in LA and AA concentrations in skin lesions sampled by tape stripping, alongside reductions in both pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate levels in biopsy samples. In addition, the study by Hamers et al. showed that 20-HETE, the downstream product of AA, may interact with TRPV1 in LSC lesions, potentially contributing to pruritic symptoms [ 46 4.1. The Potential Application of Tape Stripping in LSC Diagnosis Non-invasive or minimally invasive sampling methods have made significant advances in the diagnosis of skin diseases. Tape stripping, as a non-invasive skin sampling technique, not only minimizes patient discomfort but also mitigates the risks of infection and complications associated with traditional biopsies. We found that LA and AA obtained through tape stripping from LSC skin demonstrated outstanding discriminatory performance in an external validation using seven machine learning algorithms ( Figure 3 47 48 49 50 4.2. Release of LA and AA After Skin Damage in LSC Skin lipids are pivotal for maintaining the integrity of the skin’s barrier function and modulating skin inflammation. LA and AA are omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are free fatty acids found in the stratum corneum of human skin and are important components of skin cell membrane phospholipids [ 51 52 53 54 55 56 4.3. The Inflammatory Activity of AA-Derived HETE and Leukotrienes in LSC Cytochrome P450 ω-hydroxylases can catabolize AA into HETEs, including 20-HETE [ 45 57 58 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 4.4. The Interplay of 20-HETE, TRPV1, and PKM2 in LSC Pathogenesis Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) is present in a wide range of skin cells and plays a role in itch transmission, skin barrier homeostasis, epidermal proliferation, and inflammation [ 66 67 68 69 The itch–scratch cycle exacerbates LSC by contributing to skin thickening. The pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) is a glycolytic enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, which enters mitochondria to participate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle [ 70 Figure 8 71 72 Figure 8 This study provides insights into the pathogenesis of LSC and identifies a promising non-invasive tape-stripping diagnostic approach. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge several limitations. Primarily, the analysis is based on a comparison between diseased and healthy skin tissues of the same individuals, which may overlook the variability in skin metabolism and the inflammatory responses of individuals without LSC. Moreover, the metabolite composition of skin tape samples differs from that of biopsy samples, representing the distinct metabolic activities of skin surface secretions as opposed to the deeper tissue metabolism. The metabolites collected via tape stripping are minimal in quantity and may not fully represent the entire pathological state of the skin, being susceptible to external environmental factors, such as vaginal cleansers, medications, and inflammation. Additionally, the diagnostic efficacy of the identified biomarkers, LA and AA, requires further validation in larger and more heterogeneous cohorts to confirm their diagnostic reliability and applicability. The relatively small validation cohort is also a limitation, and larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. The current study also lacks comparison with other pruritic or inflammatory dermatoses, which may affect the disease specificity of the findings. Despite these considerations, our research advances a non-invasive sampling method for LSC, facilitating the prospect of population-based validation. 5. Conclusions Our study revealed that the tape stripping method offers a promising non-invasive diagnostic technique for LSC. In addition, we propose that the potential biomarkers, including AA and its downstream metabolite 20-HETE, are involved in the itch–scratch cycle by activating the TRPV1 pathway. This activation subsequently stimulates energy metabolism and contributes to lichenization. Our findings offer novel insights into the pathogenesis of LSC and suggest innovative avenues for the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools for this dermatological condition.

Vulvar itching is intricately linked to the specific anatomical location of the vulva, rendering it more susceptible to irritants due to its proximity to the urinary, reproductive, and digestive tracts. Additionally, external stress such as chafing and scratching can disrupt skin cell membranes, triggering the activation of PLA2. This enzyme catalyzes the breakdown of phospholipids in the skin into AA, which further undergoes metabolism by CYP4A11 to form 20-HETE. Furthermore, 20-HETE can directly bind to the TRPV1 receptor, inducing itching and initiating the itch–scratch cycle. Subsequent scratching enhances PKM2 activity and increases tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Ultimately, these cascading events fuel keratinocyte proliferation and culminate in the thickening and lichenification of the vulvar skin. Abbreviations: TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
