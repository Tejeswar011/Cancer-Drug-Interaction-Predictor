Loss of NF1 in MPNST leads to hyperactivation of RAS, however little is known about relevant downstream oncogenic signaling through RAF paralogs and effective targeted therapies in MPNST are still lacking. Methods Conditional gene expression, CRISPR-CAS9, and shRNA-mediated knockdown were used to perform gain/loss-of-function experiments to explore the effect of reconstituting the GTPase-activating protein-related domain of NF1 or knockdown of A/B/CRAF kinases on ERK signaling output and MPNST cell growth. Colony formation, cell proliferation and live cells imaging assays were performed to assess cell growth in response to genetic manipulations or drug treatments. Pathway enrichment analysis on RNA sequencing following drug perturbation, efficacy studies in cell-line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models, and immunoblotting/immunohistochemistry were conducted to assess tumor growth and ERK pathway activity in cells or in pharmacodynamic analyses of tumor xenografts. Results NF1 loss activates RAS/ERK signaling through B/CRAF, and cell growth and ERK signaling of NF1-MPNST are dependent on B/CRAF, but not ARAF. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of B/CRAF using a paralog-selective RAF inhibitor (RAFi) significantly potentiates MEK inhibitor (MEKi) treatment through more effective suppression of ERK signaling and proliferation. This is shown in multiple traditional and patient-derived cell line and xenograft models, including those with acquired resistance to MEKi. Conclusions These findings contribute preclinical evidence that the combination of paralog-selective B/CRAFi and MEKi is effective in NF1-MPNST and can overcome resistance to single agent MEKi.

NF1-MPNST are highly aggressive, with a relatively poor prognosis, and are the leading cause of death in these patients (Rasmussen et al. 2001 2012 The NF1 1999 2020 2021 2024 2018 2020 2015 2014 2011 2021 2020 The RAF kinases are the RAS effectors responsible for activating the MEK-ERK cascade and function as critical mediators of RAS-driven tumorigenesis (Collisson et al. 2012 2011 2011 2013 Historically, type 1 RAF inhibitors (RAFi, vemurafenib, dabrafenib and others), which selectively target monomeric BRAF V600 mutants (Joseph et al. 2010 BRAF 2013 2010 2018 2015 2018 2021 2024 2023 2019 NRAS 2023 2021 BRAF 2024 To further improve clinical outcomes with type 2 RAFi, current efforts are focused on the development and testing of combinatorial strategies ( NCT03284502 NCT02974725 NCT02607813 2021 2024 In NF1-deficient MPNST, however, the role of the three RAF paralogs is still unclear, and whether vertical inhibition of ERK signaling via combined inhibition of RAF dimers and MEK will be effective in NF1-associated tumors, is still under investigation. A previous study reported the in vitro potency of the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib in cell line models of MPNST which also targets B/CRAF (Ambrosini et al. 2008 2021 2020 RAF1 2021 Here, we demonstrate an inhibitory effect of NF1-GRD (GAP-related domain, residues 1198–1509) fused with RAS-CAAX motif on tumor cell growth and ERK signaling in NF1-MPNST and further prove the growth dependency of NF1-MPNST cells on CRAF and BRAF. A panel of NF1-MPNST cells shows sensitivity to a type 2 paralog selective C/BRAF inhibitor. Restoration of NF1 GAP function or genetic ablation of CRAF or BRAF sensitizes NF1-MPNST cells to the MEKi trametinib. Moreover, combination benefit is observed in in vitro native cell lines as well as in trametinib-resistant models and in vivo cell line and patient-derived tumor xenografts treated with the combination of clinical grade small molecule inhibitors of C/BRAF and MEK. Notably, the in vitro potency of combined type 2 C/BRAFi and MEKi is not obvious in NF1 Materials and Methods In vivo mouse studies 6- to 8-week-old NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid tm1Wjl scid 3 2 Statistical analysis Student’s t-test was used to calculate statistical significance.

Results NF1 negatively regulates RAS signaling and cell growth in MPNST It is well established that NF1 inactivation upregulates RAS/ERK signaling (Nissan et al. 2014 2013 NF1 2017 NF1 2014 1990 2006 NP_000258.1 2017 2019 1 1 1 NF1 NF1 BRAF NF1 BRAF 2013 Fig. 1 NF1 negatively regulates RAS signaling and cell growth in MPNST. A B A C p p NF1-MPNST cells are sensitive to C/BRAF genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition All three RAF paralogs share a conserved domain architecture and perform a central role as MAP3K in RAS/ERK signaling (Terrell and Morrison 2019 2011 BRAF 2008 2015 BRAF 2013 To understand the role of the three RAFs in NF1-deficient MPNST cells, we introduced lentivirus-based shRNA-mediated knockdown of A/ B/ CRAF using two independent shRNAs validated previously (see Supplementary Methods).

D 2 E GFP p p p The combined inhibition of RAF and MEK is active in vitro and elicits more potent suppression of ERK signaling Both adaptive (short-term treatment) and acquired (long term exposure) resistance to MEKi involves reactivation of ERK signaling by upregulation of RTK (Wang et al. 2021 2014 2014 2014 As shown in Figs. 1 3 4 4 4 NF1 4 2016 4 BRAF 2021 Fig. 4 The combined inhibition of RAF and MEK is active in vitro and elicits more potent suppression of ERK signaling. A 2 B C NF1 D A The combined inhibition of RAF and MEK demonstrates synergy in MEKi-resistant models We previously established two models (ST8814Res and NF90.8Res) with acquired resistance to trametinib, in which mechanisms of acquired resistance are mediated by HGF/MET and PDGFRβ, respectively (Wang et al. 2021 RAF1 2021 RAF1 2021 We therefore hypothesized that upregulation of RTK activity in part converged on CRAF for reactivation of ERK signaling, leading to MEKi resistance, and type 2 RAFi plus MEKi might be effective at overcoming MEKi resistance. Considering this, we assessed the efficacy of this combination on cell growth and observed synergistic inhibition in the two parental/ resistant pairs (Figs. 5 5 Fig. 5 The combined inhibition of RAF and MEK is synergistic in MEKi-resistant models. A B C D 4 E To further explore mechanisms contributing to sensitivity to LXH254 plus trametinib, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on ST8814, NF90.8 and S462 cells (Fig. 5 Combined inhibition of RAF and MEK demonstrates efficacy in in vivo cell line and patient-derived models of NF1-MPNST Based on these data, we hypothesized that in NF1-deficient MPNST, vertical inhibition of ERK signaling by pan-RAFi plus MEKi would enhance the efficacy of single-agent MEKi through partially overcoming both the adaptive and acquired resistance to MEKi. LXH254 has exhibited an acceptable safety profile, pharmacodynamic activity, and limited anti-tumor activity as a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors driven by ERK signaling alterations, necessitating combination therapies to improve its efficacy (Janku et al. 2024 6 6 6 2023 6 6 Fig. 6 Combined inhibition of RAF and MEK demonstrates efficacy in in vivo cell line and patient-derived models of NF1-MPNST. A P P P P B C D B C D E F E A F C F Discussion Tumors with loss of NF1, both benign tumors such as pNF, and high-grade malignancies including MPNST, are characterized by hyperactivation of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling. Small molecule inhibitors targeting MEK (selumetinib) (Gross et al. 2020 2021 2021 CDKN2A SUZ12 EED 2020 2018 2021 2020 2023 2020 2023 2023 Here, we demonstrate the inhibitory effects of the NF1 GAP-related domain on RAS effector signaling and cell growth of NF1-MPNST, which is consistent with previous reports (Bai et al. 2019 In this report, we interrogate the functional role of the three RAF paralogs – ARAF/ BRAF/ CRAF – in NF1-null MPNST. CRAF genetic depletion most markedly reduced cell growth and proliferation in MPNST with loss of NF1, followed by moderate reduction with BRAF knockdown, and only minimal effect with ARAF suppression. Concomitant ablation of CRAF and BRAF provided further inhibition of cell growth, indicative of the driver role of CRAF/BRAF in ERK signal transduction driven by loss of NF1, in line with a recent report highlighting that MEKi-induced CRAF/BRAF dimer formation confers resistance to MEKi (Miranda-Roman et al. 2024 K/NRAS 2021 2021 In addition to NF1 GAP function, CRAF/BRAF genetic abrogation also enhances the sensitivity of NF1-MPNST cells to MEKi through sustained inhibition of ERK signaling, providing the rationale for combined type 2 RAFi with MEKi in this type of disease. Reported knockdown screens have identified a synthetic lethal interaction between CRAF genetic ablation and MEK inhibition in KRAS 2014 BRAF BRAF 2013 2013 Combined inhibition of RAF dimers and MEK demonstrates tumor regression through activity in cell growth signaling and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). A previous study reported the combinatorial efficacy of type 2 RAFi plus MEKi in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent models through tumor cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. In this work, type 2 RAFi plus MEKi elicits anti-tumor activity via durable suppression of ERK signaling and immunologically induction of CD8 + T cells (Hong et al. 2021 2024 2018 2021 2022 2023 Numerous molecularly targeted therapies, which appeared highly effective in murine Nf1-MPNST preclinical studies, have proven ineffective when translated to human clinical trials. In order to faithfully represent the molecularly heterogeneous human MPNST, we utilized a combination of traditional and patient-derived cell line and xenograft models developed in our laboratory and relied on a foundation of molecular features and their correlation with responses to targeted therapy (Wang et al. 2021 2023 Conclusions Oncogenic RAS signaling pathways have been extensively studied in the context of RAS mutations in epithelial cancers, however little is known about RAS signaling in the context of NF1 loss in MPNST. We demonstrate for the first time that CRAF and BRAF, but not ARAF mediate RAS dependency in NF1-inactivated MPNST, and that paralog selective RAFi attenuates adaptive response to MEK inhibition. Aligned with this, we previously reported the genomic amplification of RAF1 2021 2024 Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1. Supplementary Material 2. Supplementary Material 3.
