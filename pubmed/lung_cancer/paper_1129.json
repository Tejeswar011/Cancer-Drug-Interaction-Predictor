Introduction Delivery of therapeutics to the brain is difficult, with many therapeutics having limited efficacy due to their restricted ability to pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) [ 1 2 3 There are many different approaches that researchers have been exploring to improve therapeutic delivery through the BBB [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 For these unbiased antibody screens to be a valuable tool for the identification and optimization of lead candidates, high-fidelity in vitro model systems are needed. In fact, a major difficulty in the development of antibodies designed to utilize RMT to enter the brain is the potential differential expression of receptor isoforms in murine models when compared to humans [ 21 24 25 26 27 28 29 In addition to mammalian IgGs, non-traditional antibody sources have been used in BBB screens to identify novel ligands, including single-chain variable fragments (scFv) [ 28 30 31 32 Camelidae 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 40 44 45 46 40 45 47 Figure S2 34 35 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture hiPSC-derived BMEC-like cells were cultured and differentiated from IMR90-4 hiPSC(WiCell) [ 48 24 26 49 24 26 Supplemental Figure S1 hCMEC/D3 (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA) cells were cultured according to manufacturer’s protocols. Cells were grown on collagen I-coated flasks in EndoGRO TM 2.2. Lamprey Immunization Three sea lamprey larvae were immunized with fixed iPSC-BMEC-like cells [ 24 34 50 34 34 ® 2.3. VLR Library Cloning VLRBs were cloned into pCT-ESO-BDNF and pCT-ESO-PAS yeast surface display (YSD) vectors as previously described [ 34 35 51 600 2 2 2 52 Immediately after electroporation, the yeast was added to a pre-warmed 1:1 mix of YPD and 1 M Sorbitol and grown for 1 h at 30 °C. Then the medium of the yeast was switched to SD-CAA. Four electroporated samples were combined for a library of 9 × 10 7 7 myc 2.4. YSD Library Screening–Biopanning Yeast was induced and biopanned over the surface of iPSC-BMEC-like cells as previously described [ 34 53 54 55 Following the third round of biopanning, yeast was plated on SD-CAA plates and individual yeast clones were isolated; 96 total clones, 48 from the normal linker and 48 from the PAS longer linker libraries. Individual clones were then panned in a 24-well plate using the same protocol was followed for the bulk panning. This was repeated three times. The approximate number of adhered yeast per field of view was measured using bright field microscopy analyzed using the ImageJ particle counting tool (version 2.16.0/1.54p). The number of yeast bound in the negative control condition was subtracted from experimental counts. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. 2.5. Immunolabeling of Tissue and Cells with VLRs iPSC-BMEC-like cells were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 10% goat serum, 1% BSA) (PBSGA) for 15 min. Then the iPSC-BMEC-like cells were incubated with Lamprey Serum (1:10) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed thrice with wash buffer (PBSCM with 1%BSA). The cells were then incubated in Mouse-αVLR (1:100), 4C4, at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed thrice with wash buffer, then incubated in goat-αMouse 488 (1:500) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed thrice with wash buffer, then post-fixed with 4% PFA. The cells were imaged with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). Brain tissue sections (human and mouse) on slides were washed with PBS, then incubated with blocking buffer (PBS, 1% goat serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% saponin) for 30 min. The tissue was incubated with lamprey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the tissue was washed with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Saponin). Next, the tissue was incubated with Mouse-αVLR (1:100), 4C4, at 4 °C for 1 h. After the tissue was washed with wash buffer, the tissue was incubated with the secondary antibodies for 30 min on ice goat-αMouse 555 (1:500) and Isolectin B4-Alexa488 (1:100) for mouse tissue, or goat-αMouse 555 (1:500) and CD31 (1:200) for human tissue. The tissue was washed with wash buffer, then post-fixed with 4% PFA. An incubation with DAPI plus 0.05% saponin was conducted to stain cell nuclei. The tissue was mounted on a glass slide with a cover slip and Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen), then imaged with a fluorescence microscope. For soluble VLR-hFc binding, human and mouse brain tissue sections were blocked as described above. A total of 10 µg/mL VLR-hFc was incubated in PBSGA for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3× with wash buffer. The tissue was incubated with the secondary antibodies for 30 min on ice goat-αHuman 555 (1:500) and Isolectin B4-Alexa488 (1:100) for mouse tissue or CD31 (1:200) for human tissue. Quantification was conducted blinded using ImageJ. Regions of interest containing lectin (mouse tissues) or CD31 (human tissues) positive blood vessels were first selected, and then the fluorescence intensity of the VLR-hFc associated with the blood vessels was quantified. Analysis was performed on five fields of view containing a minimum of four vascular segments per VLR. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to compare the VLR-hFc signal to the negative controls. Human brain sections were obtained in compliance and under the supervision of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institutional Review Board (IRB). De-identified normal human brain tissue was obtained from individuals undergoing surgery for other indications. Patients consented to the surgery at the University of Wisconsin Hospital, including consent for the research use of tissue removed during surgery. 2.6. Fc-Fusion Protein Production Candidate VLRs identified in the screen were cloned into the pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 vector originally containing DO11.10 β-(G 4 4 30 VLR-Fc and VLR-Fc-NT fusion proteins were produced in ExpiCHO cells following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol and were grown for a period of 5–7 days before the protein was harvested. Protein was purified using agarose a/g beads, as previously described [ 30 34 30 2.7. Cell-Based Assays Binding of the VLR-Fc proteins was carried out in hCMEC/D3 [ 56 2.8. Animal Experiments All experiments performed with mice were in accordance with the University of Wisconsin IACUC-approved animal use protocol. For lead candidate evaluation, candidate VLRs were injected intravenously via tail vein injection at a concentration of 10 mg/kg and allowed to circulate for one hour in two C57BL/6 male mice, approximately 18–20 g. Mice were stored in standard housing, including free access to food and water, with environmental enrichment materials. Following circulation, mice were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine and transcardially perfused with a saline solution containing heparin and lectin, as described previously [ 34 Neurotensin experiments were performed, as previously described [ 30 2.9. Imaging Microscopy was performed on a Nikon TiE microscope, utilizing a 40× objective and NIS Elements software. Images were analyzed in ImageJ. 2.10. Statistical Analysis Statistical significance was tested using a variety of one- or two-way ANOVA tests with appropriate post hoc multiple comparison analysis using BioRender Graph https://www.biorender.com/ 3. Results To generate VLRs that target the human BBB, larval lamprey were immunized with whole, fixed iPSC-derived BMEC-like cells, as lamprey have been shown to have robust immune responses in response to whole or fragmented cells [ 34 50 Figure 1 Figure 1 Given the observable immune response, VLRB-encoding genes were amplified from the isolated lymphocytes pooled from the three immunized lamprey. VLRs were then subcloned into the yeast surface display (YSD) system for screening (see Materials and Methods for details). In this way, two YSD libraries were created, with one having the standard short linker between the Aga2p tether protein and the displayed VLR (16 amino acid G 4 7 7 Figure 2 52 In order to identify VLRs capable of targeting the human BBB that could also be subject to in vivo validation in a murine model, we screened the lamprey VLR YSD libraries and validated potential hits as outlined in Figure 2 34 Figure 2 After three rounds of biopanning, individual VLR clones were isolated and sequenced. An initial sample of 96 clones was sequenced, resulting in a total of 34 unique VLR sequences with the variable binding interface varying in length from 1 to 4 LRRVs ( Figure S1 Figure S3 Figure 3 Figure 2 Of the 34 VLRs identified in YSD, 22 were successfully produced as fusion proteins to the human Fc region (VLR-hFc) in CHO cells ( Figure S4 Figure 2 Figure 4 Table S1 To confirm that the VLR clones bind to target antigens that are expressed at the BBB in vivo, the 15 positive hCMEC/D3 binders were incubated with human and mouse brain cryosections. Number 14/15 showed clear vascular binding to human brain tissue ( Figure 4 Table S1 Figure 4 Table S1 The five selected VLR clones were next tested for their capacity to target luminal BBB antigens after intravenous injection. To this end, VLR-hFcs were intravenously injected into mice at 10 mg/kg and allowed to circulate for one hour. Immunofluorescence assessment of the injected brains verified that 2 VLR-hFcs could localize to the BBB (1F and 2G, Figure 5 Figure S5 Figure 6 Figure S6 Finally, to test whether the VLRs fully transcytosed into the brain and if they could do so at levels sufficient to elicit a pharmacologic response, we used the previously described neurotensin-based hypothermia mouse model that has been used to validate brain parenchymal uptake [ 30 57 58 30 57 30 p Figure 7 p Figure 7 Figure S7 4. Discussion In this work, libraries of VLRs generated through immunization of lamprey with iPSC-derived BMEC-like cells were screened using YSD biopanning on the surface of the BMEC-like cells. Using a combination of BBB models and human and murine brain sections, selected VLR clones displayed in vivo-relevant BBB binding and species cross-reactivity, allowing for further testing in mice while preserving the capability for potential future translation. Given our filtering criteria, some number of VLR clones that were excluded due to poor cross-reactivity to the mouse BBB may still be of interest for human BBB targeting. An iPSC-derived model of BMEC-like cells was employed as a BBB model, and this resulted in an improved percentage of VLRs capable of human BBB binding in tissue sections (93%) compared to our previous study based on lamprey immunization with murine brain microvessel fragments (62% [ 34 28 59 24 26 60 61 The use of neurotensin in a pharmacodynamic setting to validate parenchymal penetration of VLR 2G confirms the potential use of this VLR as a drug delivery carrier. On its own, neurotensin has limited ability to cross the BBB and enter the brain, but upon direct injection into brain tissue, it can have hypothermic or antinociceptive effects depending on the brain region [ 62 58 57 63 64 65 57 58 63 66 Finally, for VLR2G to be further advanced as a BBB delivery agent, issues of potential immunogenicity and target identification would need to be addressed. While identification of the binding partners for VLR2G was outside of the scope of the current work, it will be an important next step. Therefore, we cannot rule out that VLR2G targets one of the commonly targeted BBB receptors, such as CD98hc, insulin receptor, or transferrin receptor. It is also possible that these VLRs may bind to glycoepitopes as previously demonstrated with VLRs from a similar screen [ 34 67 34 Acknowledgments Figures were created in BioRender and permanent high-resolution versions can be accessed at the following: Figure 1 https://BioRender.com/6732w0i Figure 2 https://BioRender.com/ovth5uy Figure 3 https://BioRender.com/kg209qj Figure 4 https://BioRender.com/cz7q7i2 Figure 5 https://BioRender.com/o1pvu8r Figure 7 https://BioRender.com/8mkgv23 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics17091179/s1 24 45 n Figure 5 p Figure 6 p n Author Contributions M.E.K., E.A.W., B.D.G. and B.R.H. performed the experiments.

White arrowheads indicate regions of visible punctate staining. Figure 6 VLR-hFc constructs were intravenously injected into mice at a concentration of 10 mg/kg, and the antibody was allowed to circulate for one hour. Mice were then sacrificed and perfused with lectin (green) to label the vasculature, the mice were dissected, and the tissues were snap frozen, sectioned, and immunolabeled for VLR-hFc (red) and nuclei (DAPI, blue). Figure 7 Hypothermia was observed in mice following iv injection of VLR 2G-rbFc-NT in a dose-dependent manner. Temperature was recorded every 5 min, and VLR 2G-rbFc-NT 20 mg/kg showed a significant decrease in temperature compared to both doses of RBC36-rbFc-NT negative controls.
