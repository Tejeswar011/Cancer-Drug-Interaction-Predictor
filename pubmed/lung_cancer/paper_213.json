Although maternal diet influences offspring DNA methylation and phenotypes, its effects on the oocyte and the resulting embryonic epigenome remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of maternal methionine supplementation on DNA methylation patterns in oocytes and embryos in Polypay sheep. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed on oocytes collected from 16 twin ewe pairs (8 methionine-treated and 8 controls). These ewes were later bred to control rams, and embryos were flushed for WGBS as well. In oocytes, 2,056 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) were identified. Additionally, 17 mitochondrial DMCs were identified, with 12 hypermethylated and 5 hypomethylated. In embryos, 113 DMCs were identified. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed 22 hypermethylated DMCs. To assess the inheritance of methyl marks, we compared DMCs between oocytes and embryos. While no direct overlaps were found in nuclear DNA, 3 CpGs exhibited opposite methylation trends – hypomethylated in oocytes but hypermethylated in embryos. In contrast, 5 mitochondrial DMCs overlapped between oocytes and embryos. To functionally assess the role of differentially methylated genes, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of 2 embryo DMC-associated genes: SCRIB CERS3 SCRIB p CERS3 p KEYWORDS DNA methylation oocytes embryos fetal programming nutritional epigenetics College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison Hatch Multi-State Research Formula Fund MSN233685 USDA/NIFA 2023–67015-39527 This research was supported by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison Hatch Multi-State Research Formula Fund, [MSN233685] and the USDA/NIFA Grants No. [2023–67015-39527] and [2024–67015-42244] to H.K. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis suggests that an individual’s health and susceptibility to disease in both childhood and adulthood are influenced by environmental conditions experienced during critical periods of early development [ 1 2 3–7 8–10 11–13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Multiple studies have demonstrated that variations in maternal nutrition, such as protein restriction or high-fat intake, can influence the epigenetic landscape of the offspring. In a low-protein mouse model, van Straten and colleagues demonstrated that 204 gene promoter regions were differentially methylated in the livers of fetuses derived from low-protein dams compared to control dams [ 21 22 23 24 25 While the effects of maternal diet on offspring are relatively well understood, the specific impact of dietary factors on the epigenetic landscape of germ cells and, consequently, on the resulting embryos warrants further evaluation. Schutt and colleagues demonstrated that a protein-restricted diet in rats resulted in altered amino acid metabolism in the oocyte along with abnormal cumulus oocyte complex mitochondrial ultrastructure, and differential oocyte expression of genes related to mitochondria biogenesis [ 26 27 28 28 29 While these studies collectively demonstrate that maternal dietary changes can influence both the oocyte and offspring’s health, there is a notable gap in our understanding of how specific dietary components, such as the methyl group donor methionine, affect the whole-genome methylation landscape of the oocyte. Furthermore, little is known about how these methylation changes are inherited by the embryo and whether they impact the development of both the embryo and the offspring. The knowledge gap is particularly significant in livestock species, as most work to date has utilized rodent models. In a previous study in cows, we demonstrated that adding dietary methionine at the preimplantation stage of embryo development altered the expression of 276 genes in the collected embryos, highlighting the potential impact of maternal methionine supplementation on embryonic development [ 30 31 Materials and methods This study was conducted in accordance with the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines for the reporting of animal research. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Protocol ID: A006488-R01). Supplementation of rumen-protected methionine (RPM) in diets of ewes In this study, Polypay sheep was used as a large animal model as it has long been known for its reproductive efficiency, twinning rate, and prolificacy. In previous studies, we utilized this model to study the effects of paternal and maternal methionine supplementation on epigenetic and phenotypic changes in offspring [ 31 32 Figure 1 n n 32 31 32 33 Figure 1. A graphical representation of experimental design of the study including methionine supplementation (1), oocyte collection (2), in vivo embryo production and collection (3), constructing sample pools for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (4), sequence alignment and quality control (5), differential methylation analysis (6), and in-vitro embryo production and qPCR (7). Ovarian stimulation protocol To maximize the number of follicles available for OPU, the ewes underwent ovarian stimulation prior to the procedure. On Day 0, a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) was inserted vaginally into each ewe. On Day 9, 1.0 cc of Estrumate was administered to induce luteolysis. Starting on Day 10.5, ewes received 3.0 cc of Folltropin via intramuscular injection, followed by two 2.0 cc injections on Day 11. Ovarian aspirations were performed on Day 12, and the CIDR was removed. Ovum pick up Ovum pick up was performed 76 days after the start of methionine supplementation via laparotomy on Day 12 of the ovarian stimulation protocol. The ewes were fasted for 24 hours before surgery. General anesthesia was induced with an intravenous injection of 2–4 mg/kg of Propofol, followed by maintenance with inhalation of the anesthetic, isoflurane. Once intubated, the ewes were then placed in a Trendelenburg position to facilitate optimal access to the ovaries before incisions were made. A 2 cc injection of Bupivacaine was administered at the laparoscopic incision sites for local anesthesia, and Flunixin Meglumine was given intravenously for postoperative pain relief and to minimize swelling. Within 5 minutes of Bupivacaine administration, approximately 3 1-inch incisions were made in the abdominal wall, spaced about 3 inches apart. A laparoscope was inserted into one incision, and a small amount of CO2 gas was used to slightly inflate the abdomen. A second laparoscope, equipped with a dissecting tool, was inserted through a second incision to grab the ovarian ligament. Both laparoscopes were used for visualizing the ovaries, and abdominal pressure was continuously monitored to ensure it did not exceed 10 cm H2O. A trocar attached to an OPU kit connected to a vacuum pump was inserted through the third incision, and follicular aspiration was performed, starting from the bottom of each ovary and moving upwards. Following aspiration of each ovary, the collection tube was rinsed with warmed flush media by inserting the OPU needle tip into the flush media. Prior to the release of the ovarian ligament, the ovaries were then rinsed with heparinized saline (1 ml/50 ml), and the musculature and skin were sutured. Following the OPU, oocytes were washed in ABT Complete Flush Media (ABT360, Pullman, WA, USA) and evaluated for quality according to the standards outlined by the International Embryo Technology Society (IETS). Grade 1 and 2 oocytes were then pooled by treatment and placed into a 0.5 mL tube in 1–2 uL of media for DNA extraction and sequencing. To provide sufficient DNA amount for whole genome bisulfite sequencing and unbiased representation, collected oocytes were sequenced as a pool rather than a single oocyte. Three treatment and four control pools were made out of all collected oocytes. Briefly, two treatment pools had oocytes from three methionine-fed ewes each, and the other one had oocytes from the remaining two treatment ewes. Additionally, three control pools had oocytes from two control ewes each, and the remaining control consisted of only one ewe’s oocytes, since the last control ewe did not yield any oocytes. A pooling strategy was applied, considering a similar number of oocytes represented in each pool, ranging from 17 to 21 oocytes. Synchronization and superovulation protocol To maximize the number of embryos for DNA methylation analysis, the same ewes used for OPU underwent estrus synchronization and superovulation prior to breeding. On Day 0, a CIDR was inserted vaginally into each ewe. On Day 7, the CIDR was replaced with a new one, and 1.0 cc of prostaglandin (EstroPLAN) was administered to induce luteolysis. Starting on Day 12, Folltropin was administered twice daily for four days. The CIDR was removed on Day 14.5, and 1.5 cc of PG600 was given to stimulate ovulation. On Day 16, ewes were introduced to a control yearling Polypay ram for natural mating. Each ram was randomly selected to breed with four ewes and was fitted with marking harnesses to confirm mating success. Embryo flushes Embryo collections were performed by GenOvations (Lodi, WI, USA) via laparotomy 70 days after the OPU procedure. Prior to surgery, ewes were fasted for 24 hours, and general anesthesia was administered as described above. Once intubated and in a Trendelenburg position, local anesthetic and Flunixin were administered as previously described, and a small (~1.5 cm) incision was made in the abdominal wall. A laparoscope was inserted through the incision to visualize the uterus, and the incision was then enlarged to approximately 7 cm to allow access through the subcutaneous tissue, abdominal musculature, and peritoneum. The uterine horns were then exposed, and a 20-G Foley catheter was inserted into the distal third of each uterine horn. A total of 50 ml of saline was flushed through each horn and collected into a filtered Petri dish via the Foley catheter. The uterine horns were repositioned into the abdomen, and the musculature and skin were sutured closed. Following the flush, blastocysts were washed in ABT Complete Flush Media (ABT360), evaluated using the IETS grading system, and placed into a 0.5 mL tube containing 1- 2 uL of media for DNA extraction and sequencing. Three treatment and five control pools were made. Briefly, two treatment pools had embryos from two methionine-fed ewes each, and the other one had embryos from one treatment ewe, as the remaining three did not yield any embryos. Additionally, three control pools had embryos from two control ewes each, and the remaining two control pools consisted only of one ewe’s embryos each. A pooling strategy was applied, considering a similar number of embryos represented in each pool, containing 10 to 13 embryos. Whole-genome DNA methylation analysis of oocytes and embryos Oocyte and embryo samples were processed for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), which enables bisulfite conversion directly from cells without the need for prior DNA purification. Following bisulfite conversion, whole genome amplification was performed using the Pico Methyl-Seq Library Prep Kit (Zymo Research) to ensure sufficient DNA for downstream analysis. The amplification was followed by adapter ligation and PCR amplification to prepare the sequencing libraries. Sequencing was performed at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, using the NovaSeq X Plus platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with two 25B lanes, using V1.0 sequencing kits. Fastq files were generated and demultiplexed using the bcl2fastq v2.20 Conversion Software (Illumina) for downstream analysis. Bioinformatics analysis Following WGBS, the 150 bp paired-end reads for 8 blastocyst stage embryo pools (5 control, 3 treatment) and 7 oocyte pools (4 control, 3 treatment) were processed using FastQC v0.12.1 to generate sequence quality reports. TrimGalore v0.6.1 and Cutadapt v4.8 were utilized for trimming any low-quality bases, reads, and adapter sequences [ 34–36 37 38 Differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) within CpG islands of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from oocytes and embryos were identified using the methylKit R package. Comparisons were performed between control and treatment groups for embryo pools, oocyte pools, and their respective mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [ 39 40 41 After detecting DMCs, the ‘ARS-UI_Ramb_v3.0’ reference genome annotations were used with the R packages ‘genomation’ and ‘GenomicRanges’ to analyse the distribution of methylation differences across gene components (e.g., promoters, introns, exons, intergenic regions). Additionally, the corresponding genes associated with the identified DMCs were determined, along with their distances from transcription start sites [ 42 43 In-vitro embryo production To assess whether the genes identified as differentially methylated in embryos have functional roles in early embryonic development, two candidate genes harbouring DMCs within their introns were selected for siRNA knockdown experiments. To validate the effects across species, bovine ovaries were sourced from a local abattoir. In vitro embryo production was performed as previously described by Tribulo et al. [ 44 44 Following maturation, COCs were washed 3 times in HEPES-TALP and transferred in groups of 200–250 to fertilization dishes containing 1700 µL of IVF-TALP [ 44 6 6 44 Electroporation with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) Electroporation was performed approximately 12 hours post-fertilization, at the zygote stage, to ensure delivery of siRNAs before embryo cleavage. For this procedure, zygotes were removed from the culture plate in groups of 40 and washed twice in HEPES-TALP, followed by 3 washes in Opti-MEM (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA). Each group was then passed through 2 sequential 5.7 µL drops containing Opti-MEM supplemented with custom-designed siRNAs (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD, USA) at a final concentration of 10 µM. This concentration was selected based on preliminary testing of multiple siRNA concentrations, where 10 µM yielded optimal delivery and knockdown efficiency. Zygotes were then transferred in 5.7 µL of the siRNA/Opti-MEM solution to an electroporation slide equipped with platinum plate electrodes (15 mm length, 1 mm gap, 1.5 mm height; Bulldog Bio, Portsmouth, NH, USA). Electroporated control zygotes were transferred in 5.7 uL of Opti-MEM alone. Electroporation was performed using the following parameters: poring pulses − 20 V, 6 pulses, 1.5 ms duration, 50 ms intervals, 10% decay rate, and transfer pulse − 3 V/mm, 5 pulses, 50 ms duration, 50 ms intervals, 40% decay rate. Following electroporation, zygotes were washed 3 times in HEPES-TALP and returned to a fresh culture plate containing 500 µL of SOF-BEII medium [ 44 https://www.r-project.org/ p Gene expression analysis To evaluate if electroporation of zygotes with siRNAs of interest altered gene expression in embryos, RNA was extracted from day 7.5 blastocysts using the RNAqueous-Micro Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). RNA was then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, CA, USA), and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using iTaq SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad). The Beta Actin gene was used as an endogenous control, and primers for the genes of interest, SCRIB CERS3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/ −ΔΔ CT 45 Results Effects of maternal diet on DNA methylation patterns in oocytes To determine the impact of methionine supplementation on DNA methylation patterns in oocytes, we performed WGBS on samples from 3 treatment pools and 4 control pools. A total of 49,010 cytosines in CpG contexts were identified, of which 2,056 were differentially methylated between the treatment and control groups (FDR < 0.01; methylation difference > 15%). Of these, 2,034 were hypomethylated and 22 were hypermethylated (Supplementary file 1; Figure 2A Figure 2B COL3A1 Figure 2. (A) Volcano plot of DMC analysis in genomic DNA of the oocytes. DMCs were defined as those with a methylation difference (x-axis) greater than 15% between treatment and control animals, with an FDR of 0.01 (y-axis) as threshold values.

Additionally, mitochondrial DNA methylation was analysed to assess the impact of the methionine-enriched diet. Between the treatment and control groups, 17 DMCs were identified, with 12 DMCs being hypermethylated and 5 being hypomethylated (Supplementary file 1; Figure 2C Effects of maternal diet on methylation patterns in embryos To investigate whether methionine supplementation in the maternal diet affects DNA methylation in embryos produced from the same methionine-treated ewes used for OPU, we performed WGBS from 3 treatment pools and 5 control pools, each consisting of 10–13 embryos. No morphological differences were found between the embryo groups. Of the 200,250 cytosines analysed, 113 were differentially methylated between the treatment and control groups (FDR < 0.01; methylation difference > 15%). Of these, 112 DMCs were hypermethylated, and only one DMC was hypomethylated (Supplementary file 2; Figure 3A Figure 3B B4GALT4 LOC132659112 COL1A2 LOC101118284 OR5W2 LOC114118352 HNRNPR CERS3 SCRIB SCRIB Figure 3C Figure 3.

Overlaps of oocyte and embryo DMCs To determine whether methylation marks from the oocyte are inherited by the embryo, we analysed the overlap of DMCs between the two groups. Three cytosines were found to be differentially methylated in both the oocytes and embryos. These DMCs, however, were hypomethylated in the oocyte but became hypermethylated in the embryos. All three DMCs were associated with unannotated genes. Interestingly, in the mitochondria, 5 hypermethylated DMCs were present in both oocytes and embryos. Two were located within the CYTB KEF53_t09 KEF53_t10 Electroporation of embryos with siRNAs To investigate the functional relevance of DMCs identified in embryos, zygotes were electroporated with siRNAs targeting two genes, SCRIB CERS3 SCRIB CERS3 For SCRIB SCRIB p p p Figure 4A Figure 4.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate DNA methylation in the oocytes as well as the embryos produced from the same methionine-supplemented mature ewes. Notably, we identified 2,056 DMCs in the oocytes of methionine-treated versus control ewes, with 2,034 being hypomethylated. While a methyl-donor diet would be expected to increase methylation, the observed predominance of hypomethylation in germ cells is intriguing and aligns with our previous findings in sperm. Gross et al. [ 32 31 31 46 47 In contrast to the widespread hypomethylation observed in oocytes, we found that nearly all DMCs in embryos were hypermethylated, with only a single hypomethylated DMC. This shift in methylation status is consistent with the well-established process of epigenetic reprogramming that occurs following fertilization. Upon fertilization, the parental genomes undergo extensive demethylation, erasing most epigenetic marks to establish a pluripotent state in the early embryo. Then, during gastrulation in the embryo, a new epigenetic landscape is established, which plays a key role in driving cellular differentiation in the conceptus [ 48 49 50 51 52 Effects of maternal diet on methylation patterns in oocytes and embryos While over 2,000 DMCs were identified in the oocytes produced from methionine-supplemented versus control ewes, only 211 DMCs, all of which were hypomethylated, were found to be associated with 15 uncharacterized genes. Although these genes were uncharacterized and mostly unannotated, some of them have clear indications for their role in reproduction by simply being highly expressed, particularly in reproductive tissues. For instance, out of 15 uncharacterized genes, LOC121818470, LOC121818464, LOC132659095, LOC121818463, LOC121816055, and LOC132659093 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ LOC132659098 COL3A1 53 COL3A1 54 COL3A1 55 To examine the effects of maternal diet on embryo DNA methylation, we performed WGBS on embryos produced from the same methionine-treated and control ewes used for oocyte collection. Given that epigenetic marks are heritable throughout generations [ 56 31 One of the annotated genes harbouring DMCs in the embryos is β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase 4 ( B4GALT4 57 B4GALT4 58 B4GALT4 59 SCRIB and CERS3 knockdowns and implications for early embryo development SCRIB, which plays a central role in cellular organization and polarity [ 60–62 63 Scrib 63–65 66 67 64 68 69 SCRIB SCRIB 70 71 SCRIB 63–65 SCRIB SCRIB Additionally, an intron of CERS CERS3 72 73 CERS3 72 Cers3 74 CERS3 CERS3 CERS3 75 CERS3 CERS3 CERS1 31 Mitochondrial DNA methylation in oocytes and embryos We observed differential methylation changes in mitochondrial DNA in both oocytes and embryos produced from methionine-treated versus control dams, with 5 DMCs common to both. Mitochondria and the nuclear epigenome engage in bidirectional crosstalk, where mitochondrial processes mediate epigenetic changes, and nuclear epigenetic regulation influences mitochondrial function. This relationship is key in stress responses, longevity, and cellular metabolism [ 76 77 Mitochondria are critical in supplying the intermediate metabolites required for nuclear epigenetic modifications. The regulation of these processes relies heavily on the availability of methyl donors, with the one-carbon cycle being central to linking metabolism and epigenetic regulation. In this pathway, methionine acts as a key methyl donor, providing S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for DNA methylation reactions. SAM is generated through the methionine-homocysteine cycle in the cytosol. However, this cycle depends on the folate cycle and ATP, which are both reliant on mitochondrial metabolism [ 76 78 MT-CO2 79 80 Importantly, alterations in mtDNA methylation have been associated with various multifactorial diseases, including cardiovascular diseases [ 81 82 83 Limitations of this study include challenges associated with the inherently low DNA quantity in oocytes and embryos, which resulted in suboptimal sequencing depth. This led to reduced and variable alignment rates across samples, with average alignment rates of 27% for oocytes and 33% for embryos. This variability introduced challenges in downstream analysis, as the total number of cytosines available for methylation assessment was lower than expected. Consequently, some biologically relevant DMCs may have been undetected, potentially underestimating the full extent of methionine-induced methylation changes. Future studies could benefit from optimized library preparation to improve sequencing efficiency and provide a more comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation dynamics in these low-input cell types. Conclusions In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the impact of maternal methionine supplementation on DNA methylation patterns in oocytes and embryos, highlighting potential epigenetic mechanisms through which maternal diet influences offspring development. Compared with hypermethylation in embryos, the widespread hypomethylation observed in oocytes suggests a complex interplay between maternal nutrition and epigenetic reprogramming. The identification of differentially methylated genes involved in key developmental processes, including neurodevelopment, cellular organization, and metabolism, underscores the potential long-term implications of maternal dietary interventions on fetal programming. Furthermore, the observed changes in mitochondrial DNA methylation reinforce the role of mitochondrial epigenetics in linking maternal nutrition to offspring health.
