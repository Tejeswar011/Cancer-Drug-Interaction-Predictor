Introduction 1.1. Study Background Plant barks are increasingly valued as sources of bioactive compounds due to their rich phytochemical content, including various phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, and other secondary metabolites. Using trunk barks as a source of bioactive compounds supports the sustainable utilization of forest resources. Trunk barks are often by-products of the timber industry, and their valorization can help reduce waste and promote a circular economy [ 1 2 3 4 These bioactive compounds are renowned for their numerous health benefits and potential applications in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics. Barks from several tree species, including Quercus 5 6 7 Salix 8 9 Pinus 10 11 Salix alba 12 4 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Acacia mearnsii Annickia polycarpa Callicarpa arborea 21 22 23 24 Terminalia arjuna 25 26 The extraction process is crucial for obtaining bioactive compounds from bark extracts, as it directly impacts the yield, composition, and biological activity of the final extracts. Different extraction methods (such as maceration, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and supercritical fluid extraction) can significantly influence the yield of phenolic compounds, tannins, and other bioactive substances ( Figure 1 13 27 28 29 30 31 27 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 1.2. Study Objectives The review aims to examine extraction techniques for bioactive compounds from various plant barks, highlighting their potential health benefits and uses. It also discusses how these advanced methods can enhance the yield and quality of extracts, with a focus on recovering phenolic compounds, tannins, and other bioactive substances. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of optimizing extraction parameters, such as solvent type and extraction time, to maximize the phytochemical content and biological activities of the extracts. Characterizing these extracts is crucial for understanding their chemical composition and potential therapeutic properties, which can lead to their application in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics. Overall, the review emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach to extracting bioactive compounds from plant barks, thereby promoting their valorization and utilization in various industries. This emphasis on extraction methods is crucial for advancing research in the field of natural products and their health benefits. 2. Methodology 2.1. Botanical Terminology All botanical names were verified for accuracy using the International Plant Names Index (IPNI) ( https://www.ipni.org/ https://wfoplantlist.org/ 2.2. Data Collection Searches were conducted for open-access articles published in journals indexed in international academic databases (PubMed, Springer, Scopus, ScienceDirect) over the past 13 years and were reviewed. Keywords such as “bark,” “phenolic compounds,” “extraction,” and “bioactive” were used in database searches. 3. General Overview of Bark Extraction 3.1. Chemical Composition of Plant Barks Bark extracts contain a variety of primary and secondary metabolites, which contribute to their biological effects and potential health benefits. Here is an overview of some key metabolites commonly found in bark: Phenolic Compounds: Phenolic Acids: Often found in bark, these include gallic acid, ellagic acid, and caffeic acid. They are recognized for their antioxidant effects and other bioactive properties such as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities [ 31 42 43 Flavonoids: This group includes compounds like catechin, quercetin, and taxifolin. Flavonoids are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties [ 14 31 44 Tannins: These are polyphenolic compounds that can be divided into hydrolyzable and condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins). Tannins are recognized for their astringent properties and potential health benefits, including antimicrobial and antioxidant effects [ 19 31 33 Lignans: These are a group of phytoestrogens that can be found in bark and are known for their antioxidant and potential anticancer properties [ 31 32 42 45 Coumarins: A class of organic compounds characterized by a benzopyrone structure, which consists of a benzene ring fused to a pyrone ring. They are widely found in the plant kingdom and are known for their diverse biological activities, including anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects. Coumarins can be found in various parts of plants, including leaves, fruits, and especially in the bark of specific tree species [ 14 45 Saponins: A class of glycosides defined by their surfactant properties, which come from their structure that includes a hydrophobic aglycone (sapogenin) attached to one or more hydrophilic sugar groups. These compounds are common in the plant kingdom and are known for their wide range of biological activities, including antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory effects. Saponins also exhibit potential health benefits, including the ability to lower cholesterol and enhance the immune system [ 46 47 Terpenoids: A class of organic compounds derived from five-carbon isoprene units. They are known for their strong aromatic properties and are commonly found in essential oils, resins, and various plant extracts. Terpenoids play crucial roles in plant defense mechanisms, attract pollinators, and protect against herbivores and pathogens. They exhibit a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects [ 11 38 48 3.2. Importance of Bark as a Source of Extracts Bark is increasingly recognized as a valuable source of bioactive compounds, often showing significant antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Extracting bioactive compounds from bark can produce higher concentrations of certain phytochemicals than other plant parts, such as leaves, fruits, and seeds [ 32 49 Zanthoxylum armatum 50 Populus 44 Quercus 1 The composition of extracts can vary significantly between bark and other plant parts, leading to improvements in bioactivity, including antioxidant capacity [ 51 52 1 15 20 Moreover, the pretreatment of the vegetal matrix, before the actual extraction, may also influence the final extract both qualitatively and quantitatively. For example, Moomin et al. have previously shown that bark extracts obtained from the bark of Terminalia ivorensis 53 54 55 56 57 3.3. Extraction Principles and Challenges Extraction principles and challenges are vital considerations in phytochemistry, especially when isolating bioactive compounds from plant materials like bark. To achieve optimal yield, factors such as the solvent, solvent-to-solid ratio, extraction techniques, temperature, time, pH, and ionic strength must be carefully adjusted based on the type of phytochemicals to be extracted and the phytochemical matrix used. The choice of solvent is essential because it influences the solubility of the target compounds. Polar solvents (e.g., water, methanol) are typically used to extract polar compounds like phenolics, while non-polar solvents (e.g., hexane, chloroform) are used for lipophilic compounds [ 10 53 8 43 58 59 48 15 38 Besides the importance of solvent choice, the solid-to-solvent ratio can also significantly influence extraction efficiency. Therefore, optimizing this parameter is essential to maximize yields [ 36 48 60 35 61 Temperature and time are also critical parameters of the extraction process. The extraction temperature influences the solubility of the compounds being extracted. Higher temperatures can increase extraction efficiency by enhancing the solubility of polar compounds, such as phenolics and flavonoids, which are commonly found in bark [ 55 62 63 33 55 13 64 65 66 Ionic strength and pH are key factors for the optimal extraction and preservation of bioactive compounds from different barks. Ionic strength can impact the extraction process by influencing the interactions between the solvent and the solutes [ 67 68 69 Finally, the extraction technique used in the process may be one of the most critical aspects of extraction, if not the most important. Therefore, this part will be expanded upon in the next section of the review. After describing the principles and general aspects of extraction methods, it is also essential to mention the challenges faced by those who attempt to perform these methods. Plant materials often contain a complex mixture of compounds, making it difficult to selectively extract the desired bioactive components without also extracting unwanted substances [ 41 28 70 71 72 28 73 In summary, although the principles of extraction are well-established, the challenges involved in optimizing extraction processes for specific bioactive compounds remain substantial. Ongoing research strives to develop more efficient, sustainable, and selective extraction methods to improve the recovery of valuable phytochemicals from plant materials. 4. Extraction Techniques for Bark Extracts 4.1. Water-Based Extraction Methods (Infusion/Decoction) Water-based extraction methods, such as decoction and infusion, are commonly used to extract bioactive compounds from plant materials, including barks. These methods rely on water’s solvent properties to dissolve various phytochemicals, making them effective for obtaining extracts rich in beneficial compounds. Decoction involves boiling the plant material in water for a set period. Gatsou Djibersou et al. described preparing aqueous extracts from Bixa orellana 65 Salix 9 59 Allophylus abyssinicus B. orellana Juglans regia Symphonia globulifera 59 65 74 73 75 76 77 78 15 74 76 77 4.2. Maceration The maceration process is a widely used extraction method to obtain bioactive compounds from plant materials. It involves soaking the plant material in a solvent to help release soluble compounds. For example, bark is first dried and ground to increase surface area, which improves extraction efficiency. The solvent is chosen based on the polarity of the compounds intended for extraction [ 16 39 55 64 Severinia buxifolia 47 62 18 19 79 80 Maceration is a commonly used method for extracting bark compounds, with several benefits, drawbacks, and restrictions. Its primary advantage is that it is a simple and easy-to-implement technique that does not require specialized equipment, making it accessible to many users [ 45 62 79 20 81 62 20 55 32 39 Several articles highlight the biological activity of macerates derived from the bark of various plant species. Habibou et al. highlighted the antioxidant and anti-Shigella activities of Detarium microcarpum 82 Ziziphus jujuba 83 Viburnum opulus 68 4.3. Soxhlet Extraction The Soxhlet extraction principle is a method used to extract compounds from solid materials, especially useful for obtaining lipophilic substances. The Soxhlet apparatus includes a round-bottom flask, a Soxhlet extractor, and a condenser. The solid sample is placed in a porous thimble, which is then positioned in a Soxhlet extractor [ 69 84 85 50 84 17 86 87 Table 1 Some advantages of the Soxhlet method include the continuous recycling of the solvent, which leads to higher extraction yields compared to techniques that use a single batch of solvent [ 50 69 44 17 53 Even considering these advantages, the Soxhlet method has become outdated mainly due to its long extraction times (hours or even days) and high energy consumption [ 40 53 44 94 84 87 4.4. Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAE) Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) is a technique that uses microwave energy to heat solvents in contact with a sample, thereby enhancing the extraction of bioactive compounds. The process involves microwave radiation interacting with polar molecules and ionic species in the solvent and plant matrix, resulting in rapid heating and enhanced mass transfer. Polar solvents and compounds absorb microwave energy, causing molecular dipoles to rotate and ions to move, which generates heat rapidly within the sample matrix [ 48 70 34 8 60 95 Table 2 Microwave-assisted extraction is a widely used, efficient extraction method that is fast and energy-saving, enhancing yields and quality, especially for polar bioactive compounds [ 8 34 70 60 96 51 70 4.5. Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE) Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) mainly involves the collapse of cavitation bubbles formed in the solvent when exposed to ultrasound radiation (cavitation process), generating localized high temperatures and mechanical effects that disrupt cell walls in the plant material, enhancing solvent penetration and increasing the contact area between solid and liquid phases. This results in improved extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds [ 37 48 66 Table 3 One of the main advantages of ultrasound-assisted extraction is its high efficiency, providing a higher yield with less solvent and energy use, and also being faster [ 66 37 102 52 48 11 36 37 The main disadvantage of using the UAE is the need for careful optimization of every extraction parameter (i.e., extraction time, temperature, solvent, power) not to affect the quality of the compounds comprised in the extract [ 34 37 66 4.6. Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) relies on the unique properties of supercritical fluids, most commonly supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2 2 2 106 107 108 109 2 109 Table 4 The main advantages of using supercritical liquid extraction methods are primarily sustainability and environmental friendliness, as they utilize supercritical carbon dioxide, which can be recycled and reused. Additionally, the final product contains no residual solvents, which is highly advantageous for producing food-grade ingredients, nutraceuticals, and natural products for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications [ 48 33 2 29 29 48 Although SFE is a modern and environmentally friendly extraction method, it has some limitations, such as the need for careful optimization of process parameters, because improper settings can lead to suboptimal yields or selectivity, making the process complex and sometimes difficult to scale up [ 33 38 2 29 48 4.7. Other Methods 4.7.1. Ionic Liquids Extraction The primary benefits of ionic liquids stem from their combined use with advanced extraction methods such as microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and vacuum microwave-assisted extraction (VMAE) [ 67 112 67 113 Betula pendula 114 Ionic liquid extraction is a green, efficient, and sustainable method that provides higher extraction yields, lower energy consumption, protection of sensitive compounds, and solvent recyclability, making it a better alternative to traditional organic solvent extraction methods for natural products [ 115 The main disadvantages highlighted for this type of extraction is represented by the high costs imposed by the ionic liquids, thus limiting industrial scale-up, high viscosity in the case of certain ionic liquids such as imidazolium ionic liquids that may cause handling and mass-transfer issues, often requiring dilution or solvents to lower viscosity, depending on the anion and cation alkyl chain length of certain ionic liquids that enter the environment through wastewater, they may harm aquatic and terrestrial organisms and some difficulties isolating/purifying the dissolved compounds from ionic liquid solutions [ 113 114 116 4.7.2. Enzymatic Extraction The general process of enzymatic extraction involves using specific enzymes to break down the complex structural parts of plant cell walls (such as polysaccharides including cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin), which helps release and recover bioactive compounds like polyphenols. Enzymes such as cellulase, protease, α-amylase, pectinase, and others catalyze the hydrolysis of specific bonds within these polysaccharides and proteins. This enzymatic activity leads to the breakdown of the cell wall structure and the release of intracellular bioactive compounds, including phenolics and peptides, which are generally hard to extract [ 117 117 Furthermore, enzymatic pretreatment can break down cell wall polysaccharides, increasing substrate porosity and facilitating solvent penetration, which enhances the extraction efficiency of both polyphenols and non-polyphenolic compounds [ 118 Generally, enzymatic hydrolysis is often combined with physical methods, such as ultrasound or microwave-assisted extractions, and optimized solvent systems to enhance the extraction efficiency of polyphenols and other bioactive compounds [ 117 118 119 117 118 119 120 4.7.3. Deep Eutectic Solvent Extraction Deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction works by using a tailor-made eutectic mixture (a hydrogen-bond acceptor, HBA, plus one or more hydrogen-bond donors, HBDs) that has a lowered melting point and solvent properties tuned to dissolve target biomolecules. DES are prepared by mixing appropriate HBA and HBD components (e.g., choline chloride and organic acids, glycols, urea, and amino acids) and gently heating or stirring until a homogeneous liquid forms; water is frequently present and acts as a co-component that adjusts viscosity, polarity, and mass transfer [ 70 121 122 70 122 123 Coupling DES with energy-assisted techniques (microwave or ultrasound) enhances extraction by rapid internal heating, cavitation, and mechanical disruption of cell walls, lowering residence time and reducing side reactions or degradation (microwave-DES for lignin [ 70 36 122 124 70 125 121 122 4.8. Summary of Key Advantages and Drawbacks of Extraction Methods Considering the data shown in the literature and highlighted in the current review, Table 5 4.9. General Recommendations for the Selection of Extraction Methods For the best selection of the extraction method and optimal yield, the characteristics of the phytochemicals to be extracted must be considered. If the compounds to be extracted are thermolabile, UAE might be the best option due to its rapid and low-temperature processing using a hydroethanolic mixture, while optimizing the solid–liquid ratio and extraction times [ 28 61 13 112 29 58 Moreover, optimizing key physicochemical parameters is a critical step, regardless of the extraction method used. The use of hydroalcoholic mixtures may maximize the extraction capabilities for poorly water-soluble compounds while preserving matrix hydration; however, excessive ethanol may reduce solvent penetration [ 39 44 28 53 61 69 28 36 44 93 In Table 6 5. Conclusions Across diverse bark matrices, extraction science is focusing on fast, selective, and more environmentally friendly workflows. Traditional methods (maceration, Soxhlet) remain useful for benchmarking and fractionation. Still, they are increasingly surpassed in yield, selectivity, process time, and energy use by ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), and supercritical CO 2 2 2 2 Given the current understanding of extraction methods, future research should focus on developing more specific, sequential, and solvent-smart techniques that are faster, cleaner, and more selective. These advances would enable the extraction of high-value ingredients for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics while promoting the circular use of forestry residues.
