Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive pulmonary disease, and effective therapies to reverse the natural course of IPF are lacking. A growing number of studies have shown that the use of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs) is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, the mechanism by which HUC-MSCs alleviate IPF and how HUC-MSCs affect the lung microbiota are still unclear and need further exploration. Methods Bleomycin (BLM) injection was used to establish a mouse model of IPF, and 16S rDNA sequencing and LC–MS/MS metabolomics were performed to explore the underlying mechanism of HUC-MSCs as IPF treatment. Thirty mice were allocated into three groups, namely, the Control, BLM, and BLM + HUC-MSCs groups, and lung morphology; levels of α-SMA, FN1 and COL1A1; and levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β1 were evaluated. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from six mice in each of the three groups were collected randomly for 16S rDNA sequencing to analyze the lung microbiota and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Results Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells restored alveolar morphology and reduced the expression of α-SMA, FN1 and COL1A1 and the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TGF-β1 in IPF model mice, confirming the anti-inflammatory properties of HUC-MSCs in IPF treatment. The 16S rDNA sequencing results indicated that HUC-MSCs treatment effectively decreased α diversity indices, such as the Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE) and Shannon indices, as well as β diversity, leading to a decrease in microbiota abundance. The metabolomics analysis revealed that the metabolites exhibiting notable differences included primarily organic acids and their derivatives, lipids and lipid-like molecules, phenylpropanoids and polyketides, and organic nitrogen compounds, indicating the potential of HUC-MSCs to exert antifibrotic effects through these metabolic pathways. Conclusion Overall, our study preliminarily confirmed that IPF in mice was closely related to microbial and metabolic dysbiosis. In mice with IPF, treatment with HUC-MSCs modulated dysregulated metabolic pathways and improved microbiota function to a state more comparable to that of the Control group. This study provides new insights into the potential mechanisms and treatments of IPF.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known for their proliferative capacity, multilinear differentiation, and immunomodulatory capacity ( Ding et al., 2015 Bukreieva et al., 2023 Lanzoni et al., 2021 Sharan et al., 2023 Mahmoudi et al., 2020 Zhang et al., 2023 The microbiota has a reciprocal symbiosis with the human body and is widely present in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and respiratory tract ( Yang et al., 2020 Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes Actinomycetes Dickson et al., 2016 O’Dwyer et al., 2019 Bacteroides Prevotella Yang et al., 2019 2 2.5 Utembe and Kamng’ona, 2024 Zhou et al., 2024 The development and maturation of multiomics technologies have enabled a more in-depth understanding of disease progression ( Karczewski and Snyder, 2018 González-Domínguez et al., 2015 Liang et al., 2024 Rajesh et al., 2023 In this study, changes in the lung microbiota in BLM-induced lung fibrosis was investigated via 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) amplification sequencing to determine the role of the lung microbiota in the modulation of BLM-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis through HUC-MSCs intervention. Metabolite changes were subsequently investigated via untargeted metabolomics sequencing. The aim of this study was to comprehensively reveal the relationship between dysregulation of the lung microbiota and changes in metabolic profiles by integrating microbiomic and metabolomic analyses and to provide new insights for the early prevention and anti-inflammation of PF. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Isolation and identification of HUC-MSCs The neonatal umbilical cords used for the isolation of HUC-MSCs were obtained from healthy donors according to standard protocols ( Xiang et al., 2020 3 2 2.2 Animals Thirty 6-weeks-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd., (Shanghai, China). The mice were housed and maintained in a controlled environment with a temperature of 24°C ± 2°C, humidity of 50% ± 5%, and a regular light cycle of 12 h of light and 12 h of dark; adequate food and water were provided. Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Center for Animal Experimentation and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University (Approval No. 20210395). 2.3 Animal experimental treatment and HUC-MSCs administration Thirty mice were allowed to acclimatize to the environment for 1 week and then randomly divided into three groups ( n 5 7 2.4 Sample collection and histological analysis After the mice were anesthetized with 3% sodium pentobarbital, we collected blood through the apices of the mice for the determination of cytokine levels in the serum. Before serum collection, the collected blood was left to sit at room temperature for 3 h, followed by centrifugation at 3000 rcf for 20 min at 4°C to collect the serum, which was placed in sterile tubes and stored at −80°C ( n n n Hübner et al., 2008 2.5 Immunostaining Tissue sections were obtained as described previously. The sections were subsequently dewaxed, dehydrated and repaired with sodium citrate under high temperature and pressure. The samples were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-α-SMA (Abcam, ab124964), anti-FN1 (Abcam, ab2413), and anti-COL1A1 (Abcam, ab260043). The samples were then incubated with the secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were then washed three times with PBST, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI for 10 min. Finally, an anti-fluorescence quencher was added to the sections for neutral dendrimer sealing and imaging under a DMI8 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany). 2.6 Cytokine level measurement with ELISA The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 in the serum and BALF were determined with ELISA (R&D Systems, USA, IL-1β: VAL601, IL-6: VAL604G, TNF-α: VAL609, TGF-β1: VAL611). 2.7 Measurement of hydroxyproline content The hydroxyproline assay is widely regarded as a gold-standard for assessing fibrotic burden in experimental models. To determine the hydroxyproline content, the mice were dissected to obtain the lung and the blood were drained. According to the manufacturer’s instructions (A030-2-1, Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), we weighed 50 mg of wet mouse lung tissue, added the hydrolysis solution, and placed it at 95°C for thorough hydrolysis, adjusting it to the preset PH value (6.0–6.8). After thorough mixing, the solution was incubated at 60°C for 15 min, cooled, and then centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance of each sample at 550 nm was measured, and the hydroxyproline content was calculated using the formul. 2.8 16S rDNA gene sequencing analysis Microbial DNA was isolated using a HiPure Stool DNA Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 16S rDNA V3–V4 region was amplified via PCR (95°C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 7 min) using the universal forward and reverse primers 341F (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTATCTAAT). Amplicons were collected from 2% agarose gels, purified with an AxyPrep DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and quantified using the ABI Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Foster City, USA). The purified amplicons were sequenced on the standard Illumina platform for double-end sequencing (PE 250) according to the standard procedure. The raw reads were further filtered with FASTP (version 0.18.0). Paired-end clean reads were merged as raw tags with FLASH (version 1.2.11), with a minimum overlap of 10 bp and mismatch error rates of 2%. The raw tags were then quality filtered, and the chimeric sequences were removed to acquire the effective tags, which were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) according to a ≥97% similarity cutoff with UPARSE software (version 9.2.64). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performed with the R Project Vegan software package (version 2.5.3). The observed species, Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE) index and Shannon diversity index were obtained with QIIME software (version 1.9.1, University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA) and used to analyze the effects of BLM and HUC-MSCs on the overall microbiota structure. Alpha index comparisons between multiple groups were performed via the Kruskal–Wallis H test using the R language Vegan package (version 2.5.3). Dunn’s test was used for post hoc pairwise comparisons in the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Venn analysis was performed with the R language VennDiagram package (version 1.6.16) and UpSetR package (version 1.3.3) to analyze the shared intergroup OTUs as well as endemic OTUs. The biomarker species in each subgroup were screened with LEfSe software (version 1.0), the random forest package (version 4.6.12), the pROC package (version 1.10.0), and the Labdsv package (version 2.0.1). Ternary maps of species abundance were generated with the R package ggtern (version 3.1.0). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway analysis of sample bacteria or archaea was performed with Tax4Fun (version 1.0). The functional differences between groups were analyzed via Welch’s t 2.9 Metabolomic analysis: LC-MS/MS untargeted metabolomic analysis Samples were thawed slowly at 4°C, and an appropriate amount of sample was added to precooled methanol/acetonitrile/water solution (2:2:1, v/v), vortexed, mixed, sonicated at low temperature for 30 min, and centrifuged at 14000 g g Supplementary Figure 3 The samples were separated on an Agilent 1290 Infinity LC ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) HILIC column; the column temperature was 25°C; the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min; the injection volume was 2 μL; and the mobile phases consisted of A: water + 25 mM ammonium acetate + 25 mM ammonia and B: acetonitrile. The gradient elution program was as follows: 0–0.5 min, 95% B; 0.5–7 min, B decreased linearly from 95% to 65%; 7–8 min, B decreased linearly from 65% to 40%; 8–9 min, B was maintained at 40%; 9–9.1 min, B increased linearly from 40% to 95%; and 9.1–12 min, B was maintained at 95%. The samples were placed in an autosampler at 4°C throughout the analysis. To avoid the influence of fluctuations in the instrumental detection signal, the samples were analyzed continuously in a random order. QC samples were inserted into the sample queue for monitoring and evaluating the stability of the system and the reliability of the experimental data. The ESI source conditions after HILIC chromatographic separation were as follows: Ion Source Gas1: 60, Ion Source Gas2: 60, curtain gas (CUR): 30, source temperature: 600°C, ion spray floating voltage: ±5500 V (positive and negative modes), time-of-flight (TOF) MS scan m/z range: 60–1000 Da, product ion scan m/z range: 25–1000 Da, TOF MS scan accumulation time: 0.20 s/spectrum, product ion scan accumulation time: 0.05 s/spectrum, and secondary mass spectra: obtained via information-dependent acquisition (IDA) in high-sensitivity mode. The raw data were converted to the MzML format by ProteoWizard, and the XCMS program was used for peak alignment, retention time correction, and peak area extraction. The XCMS software parameters were set as follows: peak picking: centWave m/z = 10 ppm, peak width = c (10, 60), and prefilter = c (10, 100); peak grouping: b = 5, mzwid = 0.025, and minfrac = 0.5. The data obtained from XCMS extraction were checked for completeness, metabolites with more than 50% missing values within the group were removed from subsequent analysis, nulls were k-nearest neighbor (K-NN)-populated, extreme values were deleted, and total peak area was normalized to ensure that parallelism between samples and metabolites could be compared. 2.10 Statistical analysis The data are presented as the means ± standard deviations (SDs). The significance of the differences was determined via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Brown-Forsythe test. For normally distributed data, ANOVA is typically used for statistical difference analysis; for data that do not conform to a normal distribution, the Brown-Forsyth test is used. Histograms and dot plots were created with Graph Pad Prism 9 software (San Diego, CA, USA). Bioinformatics analysis, including species taxonomy, richness and diversity analyses, was performed with OmicsMart (Guangzhou, China). The correlations between the lung microbiota and metabolites were analyzed via Spearman correlation tests.

The cytokine levels in the serum were significantly greater in the BLM groups than in the Control group, and the cytokine levels in the BALF exhibited a similar trend. In addition, compared with those in the BLM group, cytokine levels in the BALF were significantly lower in the BLM + HUC-MSCs group after the administration of HUC-MSCs ( Figures 2D, E 3.4 Alteration of the lung microbiota structure and distribution in BLM-induced IPF model mice after HUC-MSCs administration To explore the effect of HUC-MSCs on the structure of the lung microbiota of BLM-induced IPF mice, the lung microbiota was assessed via 16S rDNA sequencing.

The bar chart ranks taxa based on LDA scores, ranging from negative (red) to positive (blue), showing taxa abundance variations across groups. 3.6 Prediction of lung microbiota function and the correlation with cytokine levels To explore the changes in lung microbiota function in HUC-MSCs-treated IPF model mice, KEGG functions were annotated on the basis of the Tax4Fun analysis. Clustered heatmaps from the KEGG analysis revealed significantly different metabolic pathways within the lung microbiota when the mice were subjected to different factors ( Figure 5A FIGURE 5 Analysis to predict the metabolic function of the lung microbiota on the basis of Tax4Fun predictions.

It ranges from blue to red, indicating changes in expression levels. Panel B includes a bar chart comparing mean abundance of different disease categories between control and BLM, with a plot for 95% confidence intervals. Panel C illustrates a similar comparison between BLM and BLM plus HUC-MSCs, emphasizing infectious and neurodegenerative diseases. Both panels B and C include confidence interval plots to show statistical significance. A two-sided Welch’s t Figures 5B, C Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between the lung microbiota and inflammatory factors.

Panels C and D present R2 and Q2 validation plots for the respective PCA models, revealing performance metrics with points distributed around R2 and Q2 values, and dashed trend lines. Metabolites were analyzed by PLS-DA and volcano plots to identify the differentially abundant metabolites ( Figures 7A, B P 2 2 Figure 7C Figures 7D, E FIGURE 7 Differentially abundant metabolite identification and enrichment analysis based on the KEGG database.

Panels F and G contain scatter plots illustrating pathway impacts with bubble size representing impact and color indicating significance (-log10(p)). To investigate the changes caused by metabolite differences, we analyzed the metabolites that were significantly different between the Control group and the BLM group using the KEGG database and selected the metabolic pathways that had an IMPACT value greater than 0.2. Three significantly different metabolic pathways, including linoleic acid metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; and phenylalanine metabolism, were identified. Of these, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism are the main pathways affected by HUC-MSCs treatment ( Figures 7F, G 3.8 Correlation analysis To further explore the relationships between changes in microbiota abundance and alterations in metabolite composition, we used Spearman correlation analysis to investigate the relationships between the microbiota at the genus level and differentially abundant metabolites. Correlation heatmaps revealed an association between the lung microbiota and metabolites ( Figure 8B Aeromonas Kurthia Aeromonas, Kurthia Figure 8C Aeromonas r p r p r p FIGURE 8 Correlations among the lung microbiota and cytokines and metabolites.

BLM administration elicits an inflammatory and fibrotic response in a short period, causing lung tissue changes similar to those in IPF patients; BLM administration is also easy to perform and reproduce, so this method is widely used in animal models of IPF ( Moeller et al., 2008 Thapa et al., 2024 Ramírez-Labrada et al., 2020 O’Dwyer et al., 2019 Streptococcus Staphylococcus Han et al., 2014 Luo et al., 2021 Wang et al., 2023 The 16S rDNA sequencing results revealed that the Shannon and ACE indices increased in BLM-exposed mice and decreased after treatment with HUC-MSCs, suggesting that HUC-MSCs can improve α diversity in mice, indicating an increase in the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the lungs. The β diversity results revealed that the microbes in the BLM group differed significantly from those in the Control and BLM + HUC-MSCs groups, whereas the microbes in the Control group partially overlapped with those in the BLM + HUC-MSCs group, suggesting that HUC-MSCs can, to some extent, correct the disruption of the lung microbiota induced by PF. Our study revealed that the major phyla in healthy lungs were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes Bacteroides Dickson et al., 2014 Segal et al., 2013 Proteobacteria Verrucomicrobiota Proteobacteria Aeromonas Lactococcus Acinetobacter Aeromonas Lactococcus Enterobacter Kurthia Lactococcus Enterobacter Proteobacteria Rizzatti et al., 2017 Proteobacteria Proteobacteria Takahashi et al., 2018 Proteobacteria Lactococcus Firmicutes Goldstein et al., 2015 Lactococcus Amrouche et al., 2024 Lactobacillus Shen et al., 2023 Qiu et al., 2023 Lactococcus Lactococcus Enterobacter Enterobacteriaceae Davin-Regli and Pagès, 2015 Enterobacter Enterobacter Zhang et al., 2018 Enterobacter Huang et al., 2024 Enterobacter Enterobacteria O’Dwyer et al., 2019 Li et al., 2025 In our study, we investigated changes in lung metabolites after BLM injury and after intervention with HUC-MSCs via LC–MS untargeted metabolomics analysis. The results indicated that the metabolite changes were focused mainly on organic acids and derivatives, lipids and lipid-like molecules, and phenylpropanoids and polyketides. The abundances of linoleic acid, isocitric acid, D-glutamine, DL-glutamine, phenylalanine, and N-phenylalanine were significantly increased after BLM injury compared with those in the Control group, and the abundances of phenylalanine, N-phenylalanine, DL-glutamine and D-glutamine were significantly decreased after intervention with HUC-MSCs. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially abundant metabolites after BLM exposure were involved mainly in linoleic acid metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; and phenylalanine metabolism, whereas the differentially abundant metabolites after HUC-MSCs administration were involved mainly in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism. The Tax4Fun predictions revealed an increase in the abundance of lipid and amino acid metabolites in the BLM group and the BLM + HUC-MSCs group, suggesting that metabolite alterations are consistent with microbial function predictions. Linoleic acid is a structural component of membrane phospholipids that maintains membrane fluidity. Linoleic acid is a precursor of arachidonic acid, which produces prostaglandins and leukotrienes, potentially mediating inflammation ( Whelan and Fritsche, 2013 Mabalirajan et al., 2013 Mabalirajan et al., 2013 Kim et al., 2017 Kim et al., 2017 Kim et al., 2016 Richardson et al., 2013 Kim et al., 2022 Roque and Romero, 2021 Cruzat et al., 2018 Choudhury et al., 2023 Nachef et al., 2021 Wang et al., 2022 Dos Santos et al., 2017 Li et al., 2023 Luporini et al., 2021 Tang et al., 2023 Tan et al. (2020) This research mainly explored the role of HUC-MSCs in preventing IPF progression and their anti-inflammatory effects, but did not investigate the specific mechanisms by which HUC-MSCs regulate the lung microbiota. This may be related to their inherent antibacterial and immune-modulating effects ( Gao et al., 2025 Pan et al., 2025 Muribaculaceae Yang et al., 2025 The present study has several limitations. First, due to technical restrictions, this research did not verify the specific role of the microbiota using microbiota transplantation in germ-free mice. These potential mechanisms warrant further exploration in future studies. Procedural and sequencing contamination remain concerns in studies based on low-biomass sequencing. Our protocol was optimized to minimize contamination, including sequencing multiple procedural and reagent controls, using a low-biomass protocol for DNA extraction, and randomizing sample processing. However, contamination cannot be completely ruled out, and the issue requires further resolution. In additional, the study lacked an evaluation of the efficacy of the Control + HUC-MSCs group. This may lead to some of the changes in the lung microbiota, metabolites, and immune environment directly driven by HUC-MSCs being overlooked. The inclusion of Control + HUC-MSCs group will help to more clearly attribute the effects to disease reversal or baseline adjustment. Insufficient sample size and lack of clinical samples are also among the limitations of this study. Future studies should expand the sample size and collect more comprehensive clinical samples to explore the underlying mechanisms. 5 Conclusion By combining 16S rDNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics, this study demonstrated that HUC-MSCs significantly ameliorated α- and β- diversity of the lung microbiota and reversed abnormal microbial abundance in BLM-injured mice, while also modulating dysregulated metabolic pathways in IPF model mice. These findings provide the evidence of HUC-MSCs-mediated structural remodeling of the lung microbiota in a pulmonary fibrosis model, offering new insights into the mechanisms of MSC-based therapy. However, the precise underlying mechanisms and clinical applicability require further validation.
