However, few studies have examined the causal relationship between the oral microbiota and digestive tract cancers using robust methodologies. This study aimed to investigate the causal associations between specific oral microbiota and the risk of gastric, esophageal, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Methods We employed a two-sample MR analysis using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 2,948 individuals from the CNGBdb for the oral microbiome and over 150,000 individuals from BioBank Japan for digestive cancers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the oral microbiota were selected as instrumental variables, and the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used for causal estimates. Sensitivity analyses, including MR‒Egger regression and leave-one-out tests, were performed to assess pleiotropy and robustness. Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was applied to explore genetic correlations. Results Our MR analysis revealed several suggestive associations between the oral microbiota and digestive tract cancers.

A B C Discussion This study highlights several suggestive causal associations between specific oral microbiota and digestive tract cancers, including esophageal, gastric, colorectal, hepatic, and pancreatic cancers, using MR analysis. Oral microbiome and Cancers The relationship between the oral microbiome and cancer has been increasingly explored in recent years. Research indicates that disruptions in the balance of oral microbes, known as dysbiosis, may contribute to cancer development both locally (such as in oral cancers) and systemically (affecting distant organs) [ 14 38 Porphyromonas gingivalis Fusobacterium 39 Streptococcus Veillonella 40 Fusobacterium P. gingivalis 41 Interpretation of Our Findings Our findings revealed positive associations between Fusobacterium periodonticum Fusobacterium massiliense Streptococcus TM7x Veillonella rogosae Haemophilus_D Campylobacter_A_concisus Stomatobaculum Fusobacterium Leptotrichia Mogibacterium Pauljensenia Fusobacterium 15 42 Fusobacterium Fusobacterium In gastric cancer, Veillonella rogosae Veillonella 43 Haemophilus_D 44 The protective associations between Campylobacter_A_concisus Stomatobaculum Campylobacter 45 Campylobacter 46 Stomatobaculum longum 47 When multiple MR methods are employed, it is crucial to interpret any inconsistencies in a transparent and scientifically sound manner. In our study, the IVW method served as the primary analytical approach, as it provides the most statistically efficient estimates under the assumption that all IVs are valid. To account for potential violations of this assumption, we complemented the IVW results with several robust MR methods that make different assumptions about the presence and distribution of horizontal pleiotropy, including MR-Egger, weighted median, MR-PRESSO, and ConMix. We emphasized results that were directionally consistent across multiple robust MR methods and cautiously interpreted findings when notable discrepancies or indications of pleiotropy were observed. LDSC LDSC is a method primarily used to estimate the heritability of a trait and to partition heritability across different genomic annotations. It leverages the concept of linkage disequilibrium (LD), which refers to the nonrandom association of alleles at different loci [ 37 Strengths and limitations The strengths of this study lie in its use of a robust two-sample MR approach, which minimizes confounding and reverse causation. The application of sensitivity analyses further supports the validity of our findings by excluding pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Moreover, the inclusion of a large sample size from BioBank Japan and CNGBdb enhances the generalizability of the results, particularly in East Asian populations. However, there are several limitations to consider. First, although MR analysis allows for causal inference, the selected SNPs may not fully capture the complex interactions within the oral microbiome. Second, the lack of significant genetic correlations in LDSC for some cancer types suggests that the role of the oral microbiome in these cancers may be influenced more by environmental or nongenetic factors. Additionally, our study was limited to East Asian populations, and further studies in other populations are needed to assess the generalizability of our findings. Finally, as with all MR studies, residual pleiotropy cannot be completely excluded, although we employed several methods to minimize this risk. Future directions Here, the genetic databases are typically skewed toward European and East Asian Populations. The reasons behind the dominance of above databases may due to historical, resource availability, ethical considerations. We also acknowledge the limited representation of other populations, such as African, South Asian, and Indigenous groups, which may lead to reduced generalizability of findings. To address this disparity, we suggest that future studies should prioritize expanding biobanks with diverse ancestries, encourage international collaborations, and utilize statistical methods such as trans-ethnic meta-analysis to improve the robustness and applicability of genetic findings across different populations. Future research also should focus on further elucidating the mechanisms through which the oral microbiota influences cancer risk, particularly the role of microbial metabolites and host immune interactions. Longitudinal studies integrating multiomics approaches, including metagenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics, could provide deeper insights into the functional roles of these bacteria in carcinogenesis. Conclusion In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence for the causal role of specific oral bacteria in the development of digestive tract cancers. These findings underscore the potential of the oral microbiome as a target for cancer prevention and therapeutic intervention strategies. Further research is needed to explore these relationships in greater detail and to identify potential avenues for clinical application.
