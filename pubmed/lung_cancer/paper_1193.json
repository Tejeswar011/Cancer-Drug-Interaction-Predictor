The host defense relies on the innate and adaptive immune responses to control virus replication, while the viral tolerance allows sufficient virus replication in the host with minimal or no clinical signs. Generally, a balanced host defense and viral tolerance can guarantee health from infections, while disturbed immune homeostasis usually results in diseases. It is desirable to develop drugs/therapeutics to enhance the invulnerability of host immune equilibrium to combat viral infections. In this review, we summarize the advanced understanding on mechanisms of both the host defense against and tolerance to virus infections, and therapeutic agents/approaches that work by modulating the balance between host defense and tolerance. host defense viral tolerance balance therapeutic agents Heze University PhD Fund Planning XY23BS45 This study was supported by Heze University PhD Fund Planning (XY23BS45). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The outcome of virus infection is determined by the intricate interaction between the virus and host [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The human immune system has evolved to cope with various virus infections; nonetheless, individual differences exist due to diverse factors including genetics, age, gender, and varied physiological/pathological status [ 10 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 The impacts of gender and physiological/pathological status on the outcome of infection have also been demonstrated. In males, androgens may suppress certain immune responses, resulting in weaker clearance of respiratory viruses [ 17 18 19 20 21 The antiviral drugs can be considered a “foreign aid” of host defense. One strategy for antiviral development is to suppress viral replication, by either blocking the viral factors or cellular components that play essential roles in viral replication, which can be achieved via either direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) or host-targeted antivirals (HTAs) [ 22 23 A different strategy is to develop antivirals that strengthen the host defense against viral infection. These immune modulatory antivirals may possess broad-spectrum antiviral (BSA) properties of effectiveness against a wide range of viruses, as they target commonalities across various viral life cycles rather than specific viral factors. Immune modulatory antivirals have attracted increasing interest in recent years [ 24 25 26 27 28 In this review, we summarize the progress in the development of BSAs by targeting host defense and/or viral tolerance. Moreover, we highlight several feasible strategies for balancing host defense and viral tolerance to develop novel BSAs. 2. Immune Modulatory Antivirals Targeting Host Defense The host defense can be broadly classified into two categories: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is non-specific and serves as the body’s first line of defense against invading pathogens, comprising both constitutive and inducible innate immune responses [ 29 Figure 1 30 31 32 We believe it is important to develop immune modulatory agents that enhance either innate or adaptive immunity as antivirals against diverse viruses, especially when these immunities are compromised. 2.1. Antivirals Modulating Innate Immune System 2.1.1. Enhancers of the Epithelial Barrier The epithelial barrier serves as a critical border that prevents invading pathogens from entering tissues. A barrier dysfunction usually results in elevated susceptibility of the host to invading pathogens [ 33 34 35 A new strategy for enhancing the epithelial barrier involves targeting the barrier directly. For instance, increasing evidence has demonstrated that flavonoids, as a class of natural bioactive compounds, can markedly enhance the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier [ 36 37 38 39 40 Recently, the critical role of intestinal microbiota in maintaining the intestinal mucosal barrier has been reported [ 41 Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus casei Lactobacillus plantarum Lactobacillus rhamnosus 42 43 44 2.1.2. Antivirals Modulating Complement System The complement system is a central component of innate immunity, clearing pathogens, modulating inflammation, and linking adaptive immunity through a cascade of reactions [ 45 Rapid and appropriate activation of the complement system during the early stages of infection contributes to the rapid clearance of pathogens. β-glucan is a complex polysaccharide derived from fungal and yeast cell walls. Preclinical and early clinical trials have shown that in complement system-deficient populations, these polysaccharides act as non-specific immunomodulators, activating not only immune cells but also the complement system, and are currently marketed as antitumor or immunostimulatory agents [ 46 47 48 Although the complement system plays a critical role in the host’s fight against invading pathogens, excessive complement activation may conversely lead to tissue damage, uncontrolled inflammation, as well as capillary leakage syndrome [ 49 2.1.3. Antivirals Modulating Innate Immune Cells Innate immune cells are a series of immune effector cells formed by organisms during long-term germline evolution. These innate immune cells include monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer cells (NKs). Additionally, innate immune cells with newly discovered functions, such as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), γδ T cells, and NKT cells, have been recognized in recent years. The monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes can act against invading pathogens by phagocytosis, while NKs mediate cytotoxic effects against the virus-infected cells. Interestingly, some innate cells, such as macrophages and DCs, can sense the invading pathogens and trigger inducible innate immune responses [ 50 51 IL-15 is a pro-inflammatory protein that plays a critical role in activating neutrophils, dendritic cells, and macrophages, and which is essential for the development and survival of NK cells and CD8+ T cells [ 52 53 54 Polysaccharides represent another class of potent immunostimulants. It has been reported that edible fungal polysaccharides can regulate macrophage polarization, dendritic cell maturation, and T/B-cell activation, achieving synergistic enhancement of both innate and adaptive immunity [ 55 56 Ganoderma lucidum Ganoderma lucidum 57 58 Resveratrol is a class of phenolic compounds, mainly found in the pulp, peel, seeds, and stems of red grapes. It exhibits antiviral effects against various viruses by enhancing the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, increasing the phagocytic rate of macrophages, and facilitating pathogen clearance [ 59 60 Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are a family of proteins expressed on most immune cells [ 61 62 63 In addition to the NK cells and macrophages mentioned above, neutrophils also play a significant role in the fight against viral infections. Neutrophil dysfunction may lead to more severe infection symptoms [ 64 2.1.4. Antivirals Modulating Inducible Innate Antiviral Immunity When pathogens invade, their conserved structures, known as the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), can be recognized by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface or inside innate immune cells [ 65 66 Recombinant IFN and IFN Analogues One strategy to complement the host IFN response is the use of recombinant IFNs, which have been approved for treating both acute and chronic infections caused by diverse viruses, including RSV, HBV, HCV, and HPV [ 67 68 Recombinant interferon α-2b (rhINF-α-2b) is an antiviral treatment used clinically. However, like most therapeutic proteins, it has several shortcomings, such as a relatively short half-life, a narrow therapeutic index, high circulating drug fluctuations, and rapid degradation. To prolong the half-life of interferon while maintaining its biological activity, a long-acting pegylated interferon α-2a has been developed and approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of HBV patients [ 69 Small-molecule peptide cytokine mimetics have advantages as antivirals due to their relatively small molecular weight, ease of synthesis, non-antigenicity, and low toxicity. For example, two IFN α-2b mimetic peptides with antiviral activity were derived from a phage-display heptapeptide library using a novel functional selection method [ 70 Agonists of IFN Production Another promising strategy for developing IFN-based antivirals focuses on boosting the production of intrinsic IFNs. It is reasonable to envision that pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) (TLRs, RLRs, etc.), adaptors (MyD88, TRIF, MAVS), and critical downstream transcription factors (IRFs, etc.) could all serve as targets when developing agonists for IFN production. PRRs play a crucial role in detecting viral nucleic acids and initiating innate immune defenses, including the IFN production pathway. Direct activation of PRRs by specific agonists triggers downstream signaling cascades, leading to potent antiviral responses. Furthermore, enhancing PRR expression can also amplify this protective pathway [ 71 72 73 Adaptor proteins transduce signals from activated PRRs to downstream kinases and transcription factors. Promoting the activity or abundance of these adaptors can effectively enhance IFN production. For instance, upregulation of MyD88 during many virus infections is associated with a decrease in antiviral type I IFN induction, and research indicates that the MyD88 inhibitor compound 4210 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity by upregulating type I interferon. This activity involves promoting TRIF’s interaction with downstream effectors to amplify IFN responses [ 74 Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), particularly IRF3 and IRF7, are master transcription factors that directly regulate type I and III IFN gene expression upon activation. Compounds that promote IRF phosphorylation and activation offer a strategic approach to bolster antiviral immunity. Gilteritinib (already approved for leukemia treatment) has been shown to facilitate IRF7 phosphorylation, exhibiting potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity [ 75 76 Enhancers of IFN Function After secretion, IFNs are recognized by interferon receptors (IFNARs) on the surfaces of both infected and surrounding uninfected cells, initiating the Janus kinases-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. This leads to the expression of various interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), most of which possess antiviral properties. The IFN signaling pathway has thus become an attractive target for BSA development, and numerous activators or enhancers of JAK/STAT signaling have been reported [ 77 78 Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methyl anthraquinone) was shown to activate JAK/STAT signaling and improved the antiproliferative effect of IFN-α [ 79 80 81 2.2. Antivirals Modulating Adaptive Immune System Unlike innate immunity, which exerts common antiviral properties immediately or soon after viral infection, adaptive immune responses require specific recognition and processing of viral-derived antigens, conferring delayed but stronger protection against specific pathogens on the host [ 31 82 83 2.2.1. Modulators of T-Cell Immunity When pathogens invade the host, they are processed through antigen presentation to form antigen-MHC molecular complexes, which are presented to T lymphocytes for recognition [ 84 85 Scutellaria baicalensis glycosides exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Astragaloside II enhances T-cell activation by modulating the activity of CD45 PTPase, thereby exerting antiviral effects [ 86 87 3 88 89 90 91 Viral infection can increase the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on the surface of antigen-specific T cells [ 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 2.2.2. Modulators of B-Cell Immunity B cells recognize viral antigens through surface receptors (BCR) and can be activated and differentiated into plasma cells and memory B cells with the assistance of T cells [ 100 101 Compound MGN1703 (lefitolimod) has been shown to modulate human lymph node B cells in vivo. MGN1703 administration increased B-cell differentiation and secondary B-cell follicle formation, and it induced elevated plasma IgG secretion in individuals infected with HIV-1 [ 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 Interestingly, recent studies have identified acetylcholine (ACh)-secreting B cells as key regulators in the early regulatory cascade controlling lung tissue damage after viral infection. These cells reduce inflammatory damage at the expense of transiently enhanced viral replication during early infection stages, offering new perspectives for antiviral therapeutic strategies involving α7-nAChR agonists [ 109 3. Immune Modulatory Antivirals Targeting Viral Tolerance Most viruses we encounter are quickly eliminated by the body’s immune system and cause few symptoms, but a small number of them are pathogenic and lead to mild to severe diseases or even death. The outcome of these pathogenic viral infections is determined not only by the efficiency of host defense but also by the host’s ability to tolerate the existence of the virus. For instance, some pathogenic viruses can escape host immunity, allowing them to replicate uncontrollably. Such high viral loads might evoke excessive immune responses, often characterized by disproportionate synthesis and release of large amounts of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). This hypercytokinemic (also known as cytokine storm) condition is intimately linked with the progression of viral diseases and associated complications and mortality [ 110 111 112 Viral tolerance is a survival strategy in which the host, when confronted with viral infection, regulates its own physiological and immune responses to reduce tissue damage caused by the virus rather than completely eliminating the virus [ 113 114 115 116 3.1. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone and Hydrocortisone) Glucocorticoids, a class of steroid hormones secreted by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, are the most widely used anti-inflammatory drugs. They are non-specific anti-inflammatories with powerful anti-metamorphic and anti-shock characteristics [ 117 118 119 For excessive inflammatory responses caused by viral infections (such as cytokine storms), glucocorticoids significantly reduce the release of pro-inflammatory factors including IL-6 and TNF-α by inhibiting inflammatory pathways like NF-κB. They also attenuate immune cell activity, thereby rapidly controlling tissue damage and edema [ 120 121 122 123 3.2. Monoclonal Antibodies Specific to Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines Pro-inflammatory factors play a key role in regulating and coordinating immune responses during the early stages of viral infection, helping the body effectively defend against viral attacks. However, excessive or inappropriate pro-inflammatory cytokine release may lead to overactivation of the immune system, triggering inflammatory diseases or immune-mediated injury. Therefore, the regulation of appropriate pro-inflammatory cytokine release is essential for controlling viral infections and maintaining immune homeostasis [ 124 IL-6 and IL-1β are key pro-inflammatory cytokines and major drivers of excessive inflammation and tissue damage. Anti-IL antibodies do not directly kill viruses or enhance antiviral immunity; instead, they target the uncontrolled host immune response. By blocking the binding of IL to its receptor, they inhibit the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as JAK-STAT3. There are two classes of approved IL-6 inhibitors: anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies (e.g., tocilizumab) and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., siltuximab) [ 125 126 127 128 3.3. Natural Product-Derived Antiviral Immune Suppressors Owing to their immense structural diversity and remarkable biological activities, natural products represent a rich source for discovering novel immunosuppressants with high potency and novel mechanisms of action. In recent years, increasing attention has been directed toward exploring effective immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agents from the herbal compendium of traditional medicines. Of the various bioactivities of natural plant products that have been reported to date, anti-inflammatory properties are among the most frequently documented, primarily identified in terpenoids [ 129 130 131 132 Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, directly inhibits the function and differentiation of pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells, and it indirectly reduces Th cell-mediated inflammation by modulating or inhibiting cells involved in autoreactive inflammation [ 133 134 135 Luteolin, a natural flavonoid compound derived from vegetables, fruits, and herbs, exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity. It can alter the M1/M2 polarization of macrophages, thereby playing an anti-inflammatory role via downregulation of p-STAT3 and upregulation of p-STAT6 [ 136 137 3.4. Cellular Therapy-Based Antiviral Strategy for Viral Tolerance Enhancement The strategy of enhancing virus tolerance based on cellular therapy represents an emerging therapeutic approach. This method involves collecting a patient’s own immune cells, expanding them in vitro to increase their numbers by several orders of magnitude, and enhancing their antigen-specific cytotoxicity. The activated cells are then reinfused into the body to eliminate malignant cells, overcome immune tolerance, and enhance the body’s immune capacity. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a form of cellular treatment based on modulating inflammatory responses and promoting tissue repair and regeneration [ 138 139 140 141 Since the outbreak of COVID-19, scientists have considered using NK cells as an effective cell therapy for treating patients with COVID-19 [ 142 143 4. Novel Strategies of Antiviral BSA Development by Balancing Host Defense and Virus Tolerance Antiviral immune modulation by enhancing host defense or viral tolerance represents two complementary strategies. However, as previously mentioned, host immunity is double-edged sword and both strategies have limitations. On the one hand, when immunostimulants are used for antiviral therapy in clinical practice, particular attention must be paid to the timing of administration [ 144 An ideal immune modulator, such as BSA, should possess bidirectional regulatory effects: at early stages of infection or in the case of immune-defective patients, the immune modulators can directly enhance the host’s immune defenses by activating specific antiviral immune pathways or enhancing the clearance ability of immune cells; conversely, in later stages of viral infection or in the condition of hypercytokinemia, the immune modulators can significantly increase the host’s tolerance to the virus, by modulating excessive inflammatory responses and reducing immunopathological damage. This combination of ‘offensive and defensive’ properties should allow these immune modulators to protect the host more effectively from diverse viral infections ( Table 1 Traditional herbal medicines, characterized by multi-components, multiple targets, and integrated mechanisms of action, may have potential as BSAs by performing immune modulation in a bidirectional manner. Scutellaria barbata Scutellaria barbata 145 Licorice is one of the most widely used medicinal plants globally for treating various diseases. Its key component, glycyrrhizic acid, acts as an effective antioxidant and exhibits anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antitumor, and immunomodulatory properties [ 146 147 148 149 Platycodon grandiflorus (PG) is a perennial herb known for its effectiveness in treating respiratory tract infections. As an antiviral agent, PG can reduce inflammation, enhance T-cell and macrophage function, and bolster host immunity. PG binds to TRAF6, reducing its K63-linked ubiquitination and inhibiting the activation of the MAPK and TAK1/IKK/NF-κB pathways [ 150 151 152 These natural medicines exhibit multitarget properties that align closely with the theory of bidirectional immune regulation. They offer a promising direction for developing safe, broad-spectrum agents for treating viral infections and related inflammatory diseases. Based on this, we can further analyze the pharmacological mechanisms and material basis of these bidirectional immunomodulatory traditional Chinese medicines, and we can develop modern antiviral drugs that fulfill the ’balancing host defense and tolerance’ strategy. 5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives This review summarizes the dynamic balance between host defense and viral tolerance—two key strategies of the immune system for coping with viral infections—and their potential applications in antiviral therapy. Current drug development has primarily focused on either enhancing host defense or promoting viral tolerance. However, there are limitations to this approach: the immune stimulation may exacerbate the inflammatory responses, while excessive suppression of immunity or inflammation can delay viral clearance. Based on the ’balancing host defense and tolerance’ strategy proposed here, future antiviral drug development may, on the one hand, involve the development of bidirectional immunomodulators and the exploration of the multitargeting properties of natural products (e.g., glycyrrhizic acid and platycodonis saponin). On the other hand, we should focus on precisely regulating a bidirectional immune balance and developing drug combinations that mimic the ’high antiviral–low inflammation’ characteristics of the host’s unique immune balance mechanism. This approach will offer a more balanced and safer therapeutic strategy for treating emerging viral infections.
