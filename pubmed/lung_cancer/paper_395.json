Derived from the mesoderm, articular cartilage lacks innervation and vascularization 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 3 in vitro 3 Various biological molecules, including growth factors, small molecules, cytokines and peptides, have been investigated for their roles in regulating cartilage homeostasis and improving cartilage regeneration 9 10 11 12 13 14 In vitro 15 16 17 in vivo 18 19 20 21 22 To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in cartilage homeostasis maintenance, and identify potential molecular targets for hyaline cartilage regeneration, in the present study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptional differences between hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage at a high-throughput single-cell level. Through analysis of 25,789 cells from rat hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage, we identify a candidate Kazal Type Serine Peptidase Inhibitor Domain 1 (Kazald1), which is significantly down-regulated in the spontaneously formed fibrocartilage following cartilage injuries. Kazald1, also known as IGFBP-rP10, BONO1, FKSG28, or FKSG40 23 23 24 24 in vitro 25 Here, by combining scRNA-seq, recombinant protein production, and experimental validation at the cellular, animal, and human levels, we investigate whether Kazald1 acts as a key regulator in TGF-β1-induced chondrocyte fibrosis and fibrocartilage formation, as well as explore its therapeutic potential for hyaline cartilage regeneration. Our results indicate that Kazald1 attenuates TGF-β1-induced chondrocyte fibrosis by interfering with the pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 signaling through binding to TGF-β1 receptor. This interaction suppresses the activation of downstream Akt/Smad3, thereby inhibiting the expression of fibrotic genes to preserve chondrocyte phenotype. A combination treatment of Kazald1 and TGF-β1, delivered within a biocompatible hydrogel carrier, effectively promotes hyaline cartilage regeneration with structural restoration and functional recovery in rat cartilage injury models. Furthermore, we confirm that the Kazald1 and TGF-β1 combination improves hyaline cartilage maintenance in human cartilage explants. Materials and Methods Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat osteochondral injury model The animal study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Southeast University (20221010010). All experimental procedures were carried out by following the approved guidelines. SD rats (200 ± 20 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital by intraperitoneal injection at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Subsequently, a cylindrical osteochondral defect (2 mm in height, 2 mm in diameter) was created on the right patellar groove, while the left side remained uninjured, according to the assigned group. After surgery, the rats were allowed to move freely, and were provided with standard food and water. All rats were sacrificed at 4 weeks post-surgery, and samples of the left normal cartilage and right repaired cartilage were collected for histological staining and scRNA-seq analysis. scRNA-seq Normal cartilage samples (n = 8) and repaired fibrocartilage samples (n = 8) were thoroughly washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). The sequencing read depth was >30,000 reads per cell in all samples. Single-cell suspensions (2×10 5 26 Human Kazald1 protein expression and purification To express recombinant Kazald1 protein, human Kazald1 cDNA (855 bp from NM_030929.5 o Cell culture Human chondrocyte (C28/I2) and mouse chondrocyte (ATDC5) cell lines were purchased from Shanghai Cell Bank (Shanghai, China). Growth medium containing DMEM high-glucose (H-DMEM, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Wisent, Canada) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) was used for culture of both cell types. Cells were incubated in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 Cell proliferation Cell proliferation was measured by the CCK-8 kit (APExBIO, USA). Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well plates for 1, 3, 5 days with a seeding density of 10 3 2 Safranin O staining Chondrocytes were cultured in 96-well plates with a growth medium supplemented with Kazald1 and/or TGF-β1 for 3 and 7 days. Safranin O staining (Solarbio, China) was used to assess the production levels of cartilaginous glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The staining intensity was calculated from the mean gray value (integrated density/area) quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and was then normalized to the control group. Total RNA isolation and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Total RNA extraction was performed using the RNA prep Pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (Tiangen, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration was subsequently measured, and cDNA was synthesized via reverse transcription using the cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Toyobo, Japan). qRT-PCR was conducted with the SYBR Green qPCR Kit (Accurate Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China). The primer sequences for the target genes (GenScript, China) are shown in Table 1 Lentiviral constructs and chondrocyte infection Lentiviral vectors for Kazald1 knockdown and overexpression were constructed by Obio Technology (Shanghai, China), wherein knockdown was mediated by three validated shRNAs (shKazald1-1: 5′-GATCGTGTCACATCCATATGA-3′; shKazald1-2: 5′-GCTAGCTTGACAGTGCTCACA-3′; shKazald1-3: 5′-GAGTGAAGAGAATGACGATTA-3′) cloned into pSLenti-U6-shRNA-CMV-EGFP-F2A-Puro-WPRE alongside a non-targeting scrambled shRNA control; meanwhile, overexpression leveraged the full-length human Kazald1 open reading frame fused to a C-terminal 6×His tag cloned into pSLenti-EF1-EGFP-F2A-Puro-CMV-MCS-WPRE. Human chondrocytes were seeded in 6-well plates at 5×10⁴ cells/well and grown to 60-70% confluency prior to lentiviral infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 90 in complete medium supplemented with 8 μg/mL polybrene. Following 24 h incubation, viral supernatants were replaced with fresh growth medium. Cells were subsequently stimulated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL, PeproTech, USA) for 48 h, after which total RNA was extracted for subsequent RT-qPCR analysis. Western blot Total protein was extracted from chondrocytes using RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) supplemented with 1% Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime, China). Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime, China). The extracted proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Beyotime, China). The membranes were blocked with QuickBlock Blocking Buffer (Beyotime, China) and incubated with primary antibodies ( Table S2 Next, the membrane was washed with Tris Buffered Saline with Tween (TBST, Beyotime, China) and incubated with respective secondary antibodies ( Table S2 SD rat prophylactic treatment model of osteochondral injuries SD rats (200 ± 20 g) were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium at 50 mg/kg. A cylindrical osteochondral defect (2 mm in height, 2 mm in diameter) was created on the patellar groove, and 10 µL of Gel, Gel@K, Gel@T, or Gel@KT hydrogels were injected into the defect sites of the rats, according to the assigned group. Immediately following injection, UV irradiation (wavelength: 365-370 nm; light intensity: 50 mW cm -2 SD rat therapeutic treatment model of osteochondral injuries SD rats (200 ± 20 g) were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium at 50 mg/kg. Subsequently, a cylindrical osteochondral defect (2 mm in height and 2 mm in diameter) was created on the patellar groove. Four-weeks post-surgery, 10 µL of Gel, Gel@K, Gel@T, or Gel@KT hydrogels were injected into the defect sites, according to the assigned group. The gelation process was consistent with that used in the prophylactic treatment model. All rats were sacrificed 8 weeks post-surgery, and the cartilage samples were collected for macroscopic and histological evaluations. Immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining Cell fixation was performed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Tissue sections were subjected to antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (Beyotime, China) at 98 °C for 1 h. After blocking with QuickBlock Blocking Buffer (Beyotime, China), samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies ( Table S2 Gait analysis Gait analysis was performed with the CatWalk XT (Version 10.6) automated gait analysis system (Noldus, Netherlands) of rats at 1- , 2- and 4-week post-surgery according to a previous study 27 2 2 Molecular docking The crystal structure of TGFBR1 protein (Uniprot ID: P36897 Q96I82 http://www.rcsb.org/ https://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/ Immunoprecipitation (IP) HEK-293T cells were cultured to ~ 60% confluent in a 10 cm dish, and then transfected with TGFBR1 ( NM_001130916.3 Human cartilage explant culture This protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University (2022ZDSYLL415-P01) and Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (2022-176-02). Human knee articular cartilage samples were obtained from OA patients, who underwent total knee arthroplasty, with informed consent obtained. Patient information is provided in Table S4 2 Macroscopic and histological assessment The repaired cartilage was photographed and evaluated using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic assessment scale ( Table S3 28 Statistics Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism Software. To compare two groups, an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test was utilized. For comparisons involving three or more groups, one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons was applied. Data are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD). Differences are considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results Kazald1 is implicated in the regulation of cartilage fibrosis To investigate the pathophysiological mechanism of cartilage fibrosis and explore the potential molecular targets, an osteochondral injury was constructed in rat patella groove. This osteochondral injury model, similar to the bone marrow stimulation technique used in clinical practice, would initiate endogenous MSCs derived from bone marrow to spontaneously form fibrocartilage, which is composed of a large number of fibrotic chondrocytes highly expressing COL1 and reduced number of physiological hyaline chondrocytes expressing COL2 (Figure 1 1 1 1 Col1a1 Prg4 29 31 1 Col1a1 Col3a1 Col2a1 Sox9 1 1 Jun + Prg4 + Il11 + Cdkn3 + Gpc6 + Col1a1 + 1 Col2a1 Figure S1 Matn4 Prg4 Col1a1 Col3a1 Figure S1 1 Subsequently, to elucidate the interrelationships among these chondrocyte subpopulations, we employed Monocle to construct a transcriptional trajectory of chondrocytes on a pseudo-time scale (Figure 1 Figure S2 1 Sox9 Prg4 1 Figure S3 Col1a1 1 Figure S3 Figure S4 To identify potential molecular targets involved in the regulation of cartilage fibrosis, GO analysis was conducted comparing the HC and FC groups. Compared to HC group, FC exhibited significant down-regulation of biological processes related to ECM remodeling, such as “Collagen containing ECM”, “ECM organization”, and “Extracellular structure organization” (Figure 2 Sox9, Col2a1 Col9a1 2 Kazald1 2 Kazald1 2 Kazald1 2 To investigate whether Kazald1 contributed to fibrocartilage formation observed in cartilage injuries, we evaluated the expression of Kazald1 Sox9 Acan Col1a1, Col3a1 Fndc1 Kazald1 Sox9 Acan Col1a1, Col3a1 Fndc1 2 Kazald1 2 Kazald1 2 Kazald1 Figure S5 The fibrotic chondrocyte subcluster plays a significant role in the initiation of fibrocartilage formation following cartilage injury. To better characterize the functional profiles of these fibrotic chondrocytes, GO analysis was performed, revealing that the FC group significantly up-regulated several biological processes related to ECM remodeling within this subcluster, including \"Ossification,\" \"External encapsulating structure organization,\" \"ECM organization,\" and \"Collagen fibril organization,\" compared to the HC group (Figure 3 Col1a1 TGF-β1 3 Col1a1 Col3a1 TGF-β1 3 TGF-β1 3 TGF-β1 3 13 14 TGF-β1 3 However, due to the limited number of effector chondrocytes, subsequent analyses focused primarily on the fibrotic chondrocyte subcluster. There was also a significant increase in the downstream transcription factors Smad2 Smad3 3 TGF-β1, Smad2, Smad3 3 TGF-β1 Smad2/3 3 We conducted a detailed analysis of the expression kinetics and correlation between TGF-β1 Kazald1 3 Kazald1 TGF-β1 Kazald1 TGF-β1 Kazald1 TGF-β1 Kazald1- TGF-β1- TGF-β1 Kazald1- Recombinant Kazald1 protein attenuates chondrocyte fibrosis and facilitates chondrocyte phenotype maintenance in vitro Through scRNA-seq analysis, we hypothesized that supplementing Kazald1 may inhibit chondrocyte fibrosis and facilitate the maintenance of healthy chondrocyte phenotype. However, previous research on Kazald1 is limited, and no studies have investigated its effects on chondrocyte fibrosis or fibrocartilage formation, either through recombinant protein or gene transfer strategies. Kazald1 consists of three distinct domains: an N-terminal insulin growth factor-binding domain, a central Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor and follistatin-like domain, and a C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain 23 4 4 in vitro First, to determine the optimal concentration of recombinant Kazald1 protein for cell growth, we cultured human C28 chondrocytes with varying concentrations of Kazald1 ranging from 0-500 ng/ml (Figure 4 4 COL1 4 SOX9 COL2 SOX9 COL2 4 4 Figure S7 SOX9, COL2 COL1 Figure S6 Kazald1 is highly conserved across multiple species 25 Figure S8 Figure S8 COL2 SOX9 Figure S8 Kazald1 effectively inhibits TGF-β1-induced chondrocyte fibrosis to preserve chondrocyte phenotype TGF-β1 is a well-recognized key factor in cartilage development and maintenance 32 33 34 5 We initially conducted a CCK-8 assay to assess cell proliferation with Kazald1 and/or TGF-β1 treatment, which showed that both the TGF-β1 and Kazald1+TGF-β1 groups significantly enhanced human chondrocyte proliferation compared to the control group on day 1 (Figure 5 5 Figure S9 COL1 COL3 5 5 COL2 SOX9 ACAN, COMP 5 5 5 In addition to human chondrocytes, we confirmed the potential of Kazald1 to counteract TGF-β1-induced fibrosis in rat chondrocytes ( Figure S10 COL1 Figure S10 Figure S11 COL2 Figure S10 Mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of Kazald1 on TGF-β1-induced chondrocyte fibrosis We subsequently explored the mechanisms by which Kazald1 inhibits TGF-β1-induced chondrocyte fibrosis. The pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 signaling pathway is initiated when the TGF-β1 ligand binds to its receptors (TGFBR), leading to the phosphorylation of downstream targets Smad2 and Smad3. These phosphorylated Smad then translocated into the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of fibrotic genes Smad2 and Smad3, which are structurally similar, often act synergistically to mediate TGF-β1 signaling 35 36 38 To address this, we first examined whether the activation of the TGF-β1/Akt/Smad signaling could induce chondrocyte fibrosis. Immunofluorescent staining and Western bolt analysis showed that treatment with TGF-β1 led to increased phosphorylation of both AKT and SMAD3, along with an up-regulation in COL1 expression (Figure 6 39 6 40 6 Next, we investigated how Kazald1 inhibits TGF-β1-induced chondrocyte fibrosis. Since the pro-fibrotic TGF-β1/Akt/Smad signaling is activated by the binding of TGF-β1 to TGFBR1, we first explored whether Kazald1 interfered with this interaction. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the N-terminal of Kazald1 is closely bind to the extracellular region of TGFBR1 (Figure 6 6 6 Figure S12 6 6 To further investigate the role of Kazald1 on TGF-β1-induced chondrocytes fibrosis, we conducted both Kazald1 knockdown and overexpression experiments. Kazald1 was silenced using short hairpin RNA (shKazald1, KD Kazald1) and overexpressed via an AAV-shKazald1 vector (OE Kazald1). Transfection with the shRNA-expressing virus, shKazald1 and AAV-shKazald1, led to a clear reduction and increase in Kazald1 expression, respectively ( Figure S13 COL1 ACTA2 6 COL1 ACTA2 6 Kazald1 and TGF-β1 combination promotes structural and functional hyaline cartilage regeneration in rats We further investigate whether recombinant Kazald1 protein, either alone or in combination with TGF-β1, could promote hyaline cartilage regeneration rather than fibrocartilage formation in vivo 41 42 in vivo Figure S14 Figure S15 Figure S16 Figure S16 Figure S17 Figure S18 Next, we established a rat prophylactic treatment model of osteochondral injuries and delivered Kazald1 and/or TGF-β1 within the GelMA-SilMA hydrogel carrier in situ 7 7 7 7 7 Histological analysis was performed using safranin O/fast green staining to assess ECM remodeling and cell phenotype (Figure 7 7 7 in vivo in vitro 5 7 Cartilage fiber alignment was further evaluated to assess the quality of repaired tissue. Based on the native hyaline cartilage structure, two independent regions of interest (ROI) were selected to detect collagen fiber orientation: the superficial zone (S zone, upper 1/3) with typically horizontal alignment fibers, and the middle-deep zone (M-D zone, bottom 2/3) with vertical orientated fibers. This unique alignment may be attributed to the distinct functional roles of these cartilage regions: the superficial fibers facilitate cushioning and lubrication, while the fibers in the middle-deep zone grow vertically into the subchondral bone 43 44 7 7 To further evaluate the functional recovery of regenerated cartilage after different treatments in vivo ® 8 8 8 Quantitative assessment of gait parameters was performed and compared among groups (Figure 8 Additionally, we evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of Kazald1 on cartilage repair. At 12 weeks post-surgery, histological staining and Micro‑CT analyses demonstrated that the combination treatment of Kazald1 and TGF-β1 effectively maintained the hyaline cartilage phenotype over longer periods, without evident fibrosis (indicated by negative COL1 and positive COL2 staining in the regenerated cartilage) or heterotopic ossification (indicated by Micro‑CT images) ( Figure S19 While our results demonstrated that Kazald1 can promote hyaline cartilage regeneration in a prophylactic treatment model when administered in the initial stages of fibrosis onset, it remains unclear whether Kazald1 can reverse fibrocartilage into hyaline cartilage once fibrosis has already developed. Therefore, we established a therapeutic treatment model to evaluate the ability of Kazald1 to reverse fibrocartilage formation. In this model, Kazald1 was applied four weeks after surgery, followed by a four-week repair phase (Figure 9 1 9 9 9 9 Collectively, these findings indicate that the Gel@KT hydrogel effectively promotes the structural restoration of hyaline cartilage rather than fibrocartilage in rat osteochondral injuries. Kazald1 and TGF-β1 combination improves hyaline cartilage maintenance in human cartilage explants The positive effect of the Kazald1 and TGF-β1 combination in promoting hyaline cartilage regeneration in rat models prompted us to explore its potential in a clinical scenario. To determine whether this combination treatment could inhibit TGF-β1-induced cartilage fibrosis and improve hyaline cartilage maintenance in humans, we obtained cartilage explants from five OA patients and performed explant culture with Kazald1 and TGF-β1 treatments for one week (Figure 10 Table S4 10 10 10 10 10 10 Discussion Once articular cartilage is damaged, its inherent repair potential is limited. Clinically, while repair tissue does form, it often comprises mechanically inferior fibrocartilage rather than the desired hyaline cartilage. However, there is still a lack of effective clinical strategies to inhibit fibrocartilage formation and enhance hyaline cartilage regeneration following cartilage injury. Kazald1, a secreted member of the IGFBP superfamily, has been associated in limited studies with glioma progression, limb regeneration, and osteoblast proliferation 24 TGF-β, a vital factor involved in cartilage physiology and pathology, plays a dual role by promoting chondrogenic differentiation while also inducing chondrocyte fibrosis 45 46 47 13 14 10 11 However, at the single-cell level, different chondrocyte subpopulations exhibited varying TGF-β1 expression patterns: it decreased in the hyaline chondrocyte subpopulation while it substantially increased in the fibrotic chondrocyte subpopulation within fibrocartilage, indicating the dual role of TGF-β1 in directing the cell fate of different subclusters toward fibrotic or hyaline phenotypes based on different expression levels. Within specific chondrocyte subpopulations, Kazald1 is highly expressed in hyaline chondrocyte subcluster but is nearly absent in the fibrotic chondrocyte subpopulation, both in health and injured cartilage. Further analysis of expression kinetics and the correlation between TGF-β1 and Kazald1 revealed that in the hyaline chondrocyte subpopulation, the proportion of Kazald1-positive cells is markedly higher than that of TGF-β1-positive cells, suggesting that Kazald1 can counteract the pro-fibrotic effects of TGF-β1, thus maintaining the hyaline chondrocyte phenotype. Conversely, in the fibrotic chondrocyte subpopulation, the proportion of Kazald1-positive cells is significantly lower than that of TGF-β1-positive cells, indicating that Kazald1 is unable to counteract TGF-β1's pro-fibrotic effects, leading to a fibrotic phenotype. Following cartilage injury, the significant increase in TGF-β1 within the fibrotic chondrocyte subpopulation, coupled with the substantial decrease in Kazald1, prevents Kazald1 from counteracting the pro-fibrotic effects of TGF-β1, thereby exacerbating chondrocyte fibrosis and inducing fibrocartilage formation. Thus, Kazald1 emerges as a key regulator of TGF-β1, with expression patterns of both TGF-β1 and Kazald1 differing across chondrocyte subpopulations and between healthy and fibrocartilage states. The balance between TGF-β1 and Kazald1 ultimately determines chondrocyte fate, and up-regulation of Kazald1 could prevail over pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 signaling, favoring a normal chondrocyte phenotype and enhancing hyaline cartilage regeneration. Through scRNA-seq analysis, it is logical to hypothesize that the supplementation of exogeneous Kazald1 following cartilage injury could potentially ameliorate fibrocartilage formation. However, to date, no studies have reported such interventions, whether through recombinant protein delivery or gene transfer strategies. In this study, we expressed and purified recombinant human Kazald1 protein, which contains the predicted functional Kazal domain (aa 31-304), and evaluated its therapeutic potential against chondrocyte fibrosis and fibrocartilage formation both in vitro in vivo Tissue and organ fibrosis is a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, prompting numerous preclinical and clinical studies aimed at identifying anti-fibrotic drugs that target the aberrant signaling pathways involved in fibrosis across various tissues and organs, including the liver, heart, kidneys, and lungs 48 49 50 51 8 52 53 This study has several limitations that warrant consideration: 1) Our single-cell RNA sequencing of the repaired cartilage revealed that among the TGF-β isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3), TGF-β1 showed both high expression levels in chondrocyte subpopulations and the most pronounced differential expression between hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage, whereas TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 remained at quite low levels. This suggests that TGF-β1 may play a significant role in fibrocartilage formation following cartilage injury, leading us to select TGF-β1 for subsequent investigations. However, whether Kazald1 also interacts with other TGF-β isoforms remains unclear and will be explored in future studies. 2) In addition to the synergistic effect of Kazald1 and TGF-β1, we also noted that Kazald1 alone has a mild effect on inhibiting fibrosis and maintaining hyaline chondrocyte phenotype. This effect may be attributed to the inhibition of endogenous TGF-β1 by Kazald1 or to a specific anti-fibrotic pathway initiated by Kazald1 that functions independently of TGF-β1 signaling. Future studies are warranted to explore the specific receptors for Kazald1 and elucidate its downstream regulatory mechanisms. Conclusion In conclusion, this study unveils the pivotal role of Kazald1 in the regulation of cartilage fibrosis and highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent for facilitating hyaline cartilage regeneration. Kazald1 functions by interfering pro-fibrotic TGF-β1 signaling through the formation of dimer with TGF-β1 receptor, leading to the inactivation of downstream Akt and Smad3 pathways and the subsequent suppression of fibrotic gene expression. The combination treatment of Kazald1 with TGF-β1 markedly inhibits chondrocyte fibrosis and fibrocartilage formation, while effectively facilitating hyaline cartilage regeneration and maintenance in both animal models and human cartilage explants. This study enhances our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying cartilage fibrosis and proposes a viable therapeutic strategy for enhanced hyaline cartilage regeneration.
