Background Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence is linked to improved health outcomes, yet evidence among cancer survivors remains limited. This study investigated the association between Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) adherence and all-cause mortality among cancer survivors. Methods We analyzed data from 2,669 cancer survivors participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005–2018). Dietary adherence was assessed using the MDS based on 2-day dietary recalls. Multivariable Cox regression, mediation, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results Higher MDS adherence was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.845, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.779–0.917, p Conclusion Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower all-cause mortality in cancer survivors, partly mediated by inflammatory biomarkers. Integrating Mediterranean dietary counseling into survivorship care may help improve long-term outcomes.

Leveraging a robust analytical framework, we used Cox proportional hazards models, restricted cubic splines, and stratified subgroup analyses to assess the dose–response and effect modification. Additionally, we conducted mediation analyses to explore potential inflammatory pathways, focusing on biomarkers such as red cell distribution width (RDW) and neutrophil count (NEU), which may partially explain the observed associations. Methods Participant selection The present study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), administered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NHANES cycles prior to 2005 were excluded due to inconsistencies in dietary data collection protocols and the limited availability of key variables required for constructing the MDS and covariate adjustments. Initially, 70,190 individuals from the 2005–2018 cycles were considered. Participants completed a standardized questionnaire that included the item: “Has a medical practitioner or healthcare provider ever informed you that you had cancer or a malignancy of any kind?” Individuals who answered affirmatively were categorized as cancer survivors. Following a rigorous screening process, 2,669 participants were included in the final analysis. Details of the participant selection process are illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 1 Flowchart of the study population. NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Flowchart detailing participant selection from NHANES (2005-2018) starting with 70,190 participants. Sequential exclusions: missing follow-up data (28,168), missing dietary data (9,334), pregnancy or under 20 years old (2,905), missing oxidative stress data (1,129), and cancer or other covariates (25,985), resulting in 2,669 enrolled participants. Assessment of the Mediterranean diet Following interviews conducted by specially trained personnel, dietary data were collected using computer-assisted 24-h dietary recall interviews. Dedicated team members were responsible for data review and processing. The United States Department of Agriculture has repeatedly simulated and refined this process to ensure stringent quality control. In this study, dietary data from the first and second days were utilized. While 24-h recalls are subject to recall bias, NHANES uses standardized protocols, trained interviewers, and repeated measures to improve data reliability. This method has been validated for assessing dietary patterns in large populations. Although cancer stage and treatment data were unavailable, our analyses were adjusted for multiple health-related and sociodemographic variables, aligning with the study’s population-level objectives. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) is an index designed to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet ( 26 27 Ascertainment of mortality All-cause mortality rate was determined through probabilistic matching of unique identifiers with the National Death Index. Participants lacking a corresponding record were assumed to be alive as of the specified cutoff date. Follow-up duration was measured in person-years from the baseline assessment until death or the conclusion of the follow-up period on 31 December 2019. In accordance with the guidelines of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), deaths due to all causes were identified. All-cause mortality encompassed deaths attributable to cardiovascular diseases, malignant neoplasms, and other causes. Covariates This study incorporated several covariate factors, as identified by previous research, for comprehensive analysis and discussion. The covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, education, poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, and hypertension. Ethnicity was categorized as Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and other ethnicities. Education levels were stratified into less than 9th grade, 9th–11th grade, high school, college, and graduate-level or higher. Smoking status was defined as having smoked more than 100 cigarettes over a lifetime, while alcohol consumption was determined by the annual intake equivalent to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor. Diabetes was diagnosed based on medical history and fasting blood glucose levels, and hypertension was ascertained through a combination of medical history and multiple blood pressure measurements. NHANES does not collect data on cancer site, diagnosis date, stage, or treatment modalities in a systematic manner. As such, these cancer-specific covariates could not be included and are acknowledged as a limitation. Statistical analyses Participants were divided into four groups based on their MDS, and baseline characteristics were summarized using frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables and means (standard errors) for continuous variables. To evaluate the association between MDS and all-cause mortality in cancer survivors, multivariable Cox regression models were used. Hazard ratios (HRs) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to quantify these associations. Three progressively adjusted models were constructed: Model 1 was adjusted solely for age and sex; Model 2 further incorporated ethnicity, education, PIR, and BMI; and Model 3 additionally controlled for mortality risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. Furthermore, a restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was performed to explore the relationship between MDS and prognosis. Consistent with common epidemiologic practice, the node of RCS was set to four ( 28 29 Previous studies have demonstrated that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is closely associated with markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, which are critical contributors to the pathogenesis of cancer prognosis ( 30–33 γ To further explore the relationships, subgroup analyses were performed by stratifying participants according to age (20–65 years vs. ≥65 years), sex (male vs. female), smoking status (smoking vs. non-smoking), alcohol consumption (drinking vs. non-drinking), BMI (<median vs. ≥median), poverty income ratio (PIR; <median vs. ≥median), and type of malignancy (urinary system, digestive system, skin and soft tissues, lungs and mediastinal organs, breast, and reproductive system, or others). Multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted within each subgroup. Interaction terms were tested for each subgroup to evaluate effect modification. To assess the robustness of our findings, we performed three sensitivity analyses: (1) excluding participants who died within 1 year of the interview, (2) sequentially removing data from each NHANES cycle (each spanning 2 years) to evaluate the stability of the results, and (3) utilizing the first-day dietary data to validate the association, ensuring that the observed relationship was not affected by the averaging method of the 2-day data. Analyses were conducted using R (Revision 4.4.1), with statistical significance defined as a p Result Baseline characteristics The baseline characteristics of the study population across MDS quartiles are presented in Table 1 Table 1 Baseline characteristics of participants stratified by MDS quartile.

Subgroup analysis Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the inverse association between MDS and all-cause mortality was largely consistent across the demographic and clinical strata, with several notable differences in effect magnitude. Both male and female participants exhibited significant protective associations, with a stronger effect observed in female participants (HR = 0.606, 95% CI: 0.418–0.880) than in male participants (HR = 0.713, 95% CI: 0.567–0.931). The association was more pronounced among participants aged ≥65 years (HR = 0.696, 95% CI: 0.546–0.886) compared to their younger counterparts, where the trend did not reach statistical significance. Greater benefits were also observed in current smokers and drinkers, suggesting that adherence to the Mediterranean diet may mitigate some of the adverse effects associated with these behaviors. Individuals with lower BMI and higher socioeconomic status derived more pronounced survival benefits. Stratification by cancer type revealed heterogeneity in effect size. The strongest inverse associations were observed among survivors of digestive system, urinary system, and skin/soft tissue cancers, whereas associations were weaker or non-significant in other cancer types. These patterns are summarized in Table 4 Supplement Table 1 Table 4 Subgroup analysis of effect of MDS with the prognosis of participant with cancer.

The first column presents hazard ratios per 1-point increase in the Mediterranean Diet Score as a continuous variable. Q1–Q4 represent increasing quartiles of MDS, from lowest to highest. Sensitivity analysis To evaluate the robustness of the findings, multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, participants who died within 1 year of the interview were excluded, and the analysis was repeated. Second, data from each NHANES cycle were sequentially removed to assess the stability of the effect estimates. Across all scenarios, the inverse association between MDS and all-cause mortality remained consistent. Additionally, the results obtained from different model specifications and methodological approaches were largely similar, further supporting the reliability of the main findings. Discussion In this nationally representative cohort of cancer survivors from the NHANES dataset, we found that greater adherence to the MDS was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality. This association remained robust across progressively adjusted Cox regression models, was consistent in multiple subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and exhibited a linear dose–response pattern in RCS modeling. Furthermore, the mediation analysis suggested that specific inflammatory and oxidative stress-related biomarkers—particularly RDW and NEU—may partially mediate this relationship. While several prior NHANES-based studies have linked dietary patterns to mortality in the general population or patients with cardiometabolic diseases, few have focused specifically on cancer survivors. Moreover, most existing analyses have not explored the underlying biological mechanisms. By applying mediation analysis and incorporating inflammatory biomarkers such as RDW and NEU, our study offers mechanistic insights into how dietary adherence may affect survival in this high-risk population. Our results align with previous findings that link MDS to improved survival in the general populations and among individuals with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome ( 34–37 The biological plausibility of these findings is supported by several mechanisms. The Mediterranean diet is rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nutrients, such as monounsaturated fats, polyphenols, dietary fiber, and omega-3 fatty acids, all of which have been shown to modulate key pathways involved in carcinogenesis, immune regulation, and systemic inflammation ( 13 38 39 40–45 The consistency of the association across subgroups further strengthens the robustness of the results. Notably, the inverse relationship between MDS and mortality was more pronounced among older adults, females, individuals with lower BMI, and those with higher socioeconomic status, as reflected by PIR. These interactions may reflect differential susceptibility to the benefits of dietary quality, possibly due to underlying metabolic or immunologic differences. The stronger protective effect observed in smokers and drinkers is particularly noteworthy, suggesting that dietary modification may mitigate some of the adverse health risks associated with these behaviors ( 46 47 Stratified analyses by cancer type revealed that the association between MDS and survival was strongest among patients with digestive system, urinary system, and skin and soft tissue malignancies. This may be due to the direct interaction of diet with gastrointestinal mucosal integrity, microbiota composition, and systemic inflammation, which are known to influence both local and systemic carcinogenic processes ( 48–50 While the robustness of our findings was supported by sensitivity analyses and consistent subgroup patterns, the potential for reverse causality cannot be entirely excluded. It is possible that cancer survivors with better baseline health or greater health awareness were more likely to adhere to a Mediterranean-style diet, leading to an overestimation of its protective effect. To address this concern, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding participants who died within 1 year of follow-up to reduce the likelihood of bias from pre-existing illness. Nonetheless, prospective or interventional studies are needed to establish temporality and causality with greater confidence. Nonetheless, this study has several limitations. Residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out despite adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Dietary data were based on 24-h recall interviews, which may not accurately capture long-term dietary patterns and are subject to recall and reporting bias. Moreover, cancer stage, treatment modalities, and time since diagnosis were not available in the NHANES dataset, limiting the ability to stratify analyses by disease severity or treatment status. Finally, although mediation analysis provides insights into potential biological pathways, it cannot fully disentangle complex interactions, and the proportion of mediation was relatively modest. Cancer-specific mortality outcomes, which could have provided more targeted insights, were not analyzed due to limited ICD-10 resolution and small event counts for specific cancer types. In conclusion, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is independently associated with improved survival among cancer survivors in the United States. These findings highlight the potential of dietary quality as a modifiable prognostic factor in cancer survivorship and support the incorporation of Mediterranean dietary principles into post-diagnosis lifestyle recommendations. Specifically, dietary counseling interventions that emphasize Mediterranean components could be integrated into routine survivorship care, particularly targeting high-risk groups such as smokers, drinkers, or individuals with digestive or urinary system malignancies. Future prospective and interventional studies—including randomized controlled trials—are needed to confirm causality, evaluate dietary responsiveness across different cancer types, and determine the long-term efficacy of tailored nutritional interventions in improving survivorship outcomes.
