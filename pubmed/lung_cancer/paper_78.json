Findings In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, 150 patients with previously untreated advanced biliary tract cancers were randomized to receive gemcitabine and cisplatin or gemcitabine and cisplatin plus a polymeric micellar paclitaxel. The addition of the micellar paclitaxel did not improve overall survival or progression-free survival and objective response rates. Meaning These results suggest that the addition of the micellar paclitaxel to standard gemcitabine and cisplatin does not improve survival compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with previously untreated advanced biliary tract cancer. This randomized clinical trial of patients with previously untreated advanced biliary tract cancer compares the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine and cisplatin combined with a polymeric micellar paclitaxel vs gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. Importance Limited prospective data exist on the role of adding taxane to standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced biliary tract cancers, especially in the Asian population, where biliary tract cancers are most prevalent. Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of polyethoxylated castor oil–free polymeric micelle formulation of paclitaxel (hereafter, polymeric micellar paclitaxel), in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with untreated advanced biliary tract cancers. Design, Setting, and Participants This open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted across 7 centers in South Korea from September 1, 2019, to October 31, 2022. Patients were eligible if they had previously untreated, locally advanced unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the bile duct, were aged 19 to 79 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 to 2, and had measurable or evaluable lesions according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumorsversion 1.1. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive either polymeric micellar paclitaxel, 100 mg/m 2 2 2 2 2 Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included investigator-assessed and blinded independent central review–assessed progression-free survival, objective response rate, and safety. Results A total of 150 patients (median [range] age, 65 [41-79] years; 87 [58%] male) were randomly assigned to the study (74 in the gemcitabine and cisplatin combined with polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 76 in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group). The study was prematurely terminated due to slow patient accrual. The median (IQR) follow-up duration was 10.4 (6.5-16.7) months. The median overall survival was 12.0 (95% CI, 9.9-15.8) months in the gemcitabine and cisplatin combined with polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 11.1 (95% CI, 9.7-13.5) months in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.63-1.41; P Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial, gemcitabine and cisplatin combined with polymeric micellar paclitaxel did not improve survival compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin combined in patients with previously untreated advanced biliary tract cancer. This study provides further evidence regarding the limitations of intensified chemotherapy with the addition of taxanes in advanced biliary tract cancer.

This disease is rare and often understudied, particularly in Western countries, where its incidence ranges from 0.35 to 2 cases per 100 000 individuals annually. In contrast, in regions with higher prevalence, such as South Korea, China, and Thailand, the incidence substantially exceeds 6 cases per 100 000 individuals annually. 1 Many patients with biliary tract cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, leaving curative surgery as a nonviable option. The prognosis for advanced biliary tract cancer is poor, with a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 1 year. 2 3 4 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 8 A novel polymeric micelle formulation of paclitaxel (hereafter, polymeric micellar paclitaxel) has been developed that is free of polyethoxylated castor oil, a solubilizing adjuvant known to cause toxic effects such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy associated with conventional paclitaxel. 9 10 11 2 2 12 2 13 14 2 15 Subsequent phase 2 and 3 trials demonstrated the superior efficacy of polymeric micellar paclitaxel, both as a monotherapy and in combination with platinum, compared with conventional paclitaxel in multiple solid tumors, without an increase in toxicity. 16 17 18 19 Methods Study Design and Participants Genexol-PM in Combination with Standard Therapy (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) vs Standard Therapy Alone (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) in Patients with Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer (NEXT) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 randomized clinical trial conducted at 7 tertiary institutions in South Korea. From September 2019 to October 2022, a total of 173 patients were screened for eligibility. Patients were eligible if they were aged between 19 and 79 years and had locally advanced, unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract cancer, histologically or cytologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma. Patients were required to have at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (fully active) to 2 (capable of self-care and moving about for at least half of waking hours), and adequate major organ function. Prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting was not permitted. However, adjuvant chemotherapy administered more than 6 months prior or radiation therapy completed more than 4 weeks before trial participation was allowed. The study protocol received approval from the institutional review board of each participating institution. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 23 CONSORT Study Procedures Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel or gemcitabine and cisplatin through centralized stratified block randomization, using institution and primary sites (gallbladder, intrahepatic, or extrahepatic bile ducts) as stratification factors. Patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group received polymeric micellar paclitaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 Supplement 1 Assessments Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was conducted on day 8 of every third cycle for the first 9 cycles, followed by assessments every 12 weeks for the subsequent 2 years and every 6 months thereafter. Radiographic disease progression was evaluated through investigator assessment. A blinded independent central review (BICR) was performed using anonymized data by the central independent radiological review center (Asan Image Matrix, Seoul, Korea). Adverse events were assessed at each visit according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Study End Points The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points included both investigator-assessed and BICR-assessed PFS, objective response rate, and safety. OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of disease progression or death, whichever happened first. Objective response rates were defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete or partial response, whereas disease control rates were defined as the proportion of patients who had a complete or partial response or stable disease. Tumor measurements were assessed according to RECIST, version 1.1. Statistical Analysis The study was designed to achieve 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.64 at a 2-sided significance level of 5% for OS in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group compared with the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. On the basis of prior data, the median OS for the gemcitabine and cisplatin group was estimated to be 12 months, whereas the median OS for the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group was assumed to improve to 18.8 months. 8 The efficacy end points were evaluated in an intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients. Prespecified per-protocol (PP) analyses were also conducted, encompassing patients who did not violate the inclusion criteria and had at least one efficacy analysis data point among the ITT population. Safety assessments were performed on all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and had at least one postbaseline safety evaluation. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared through a stratified log-rank test. HRs were calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model. Between-group objective response rates and disease control rates were compared using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Randomization stratification factors were applied to all stratified tests, and the Efron method was used to address ties. Prespecified subgroup analyses of OS, investigator-assessed PFS, and BICR-assessed PFS were conducted based on clinical factors, including age, sex, ECOG performance status, primary tumor sites, and disease status at screening. Interactions between treatments and subgroups were evaluated using the stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model. Two-sided P Supplement 1 Results Patients A total of 150 Korean patients (median [range] age, 65 [41-79] years; 87 [58%] male) were included in the study and were randomized to receive gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel (n = 74) or gemcitabine and cisplatin (n = 76), constituting the ITT population. The study was prematurely terminated due to slow patient accrual after the report of the phase 3 Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 1815 trial. 20 Figure 1 Figure 1.

Both BICR-assessed and investigator-assessed PFS did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The median BICR-assessed PFS was 7.4 (95% CI, 5.3-8.3) months in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group compared with 8.3 (95% CI, 6.3-9.1) months in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group (HR for BICR-assessed PFS, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.74-1.66; P P Figure 2B- P P The efficacy outcomes in the PP population were generally consistent with the results observed in the ITT population (eFigure 1 and eTable 3 in Supplement 2 Supplement 2 Safety The safety analysis population comprised 148 patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment (74 in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 74 in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group). The median (IQR) number of cycles administered was 7 (3-9) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 8 (5-9) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. Adverse events of any grade occurred in 74 patients (100%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 72 patients (97%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 68 patients (92%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 59 patients (80%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events included neutropenia, affecting 45 patients (61%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 40 patients (54%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group, and anemia, affecting 16 patients (22%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 18 patients (24%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group.

Dose adjustments were necessary for 63 patients (85%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group and 48 patients (65%) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. In the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group, the median (IQR) RDI per cycle of polymeric micellar paclitaxel was 70% (55%-81%); the median (IQR) RDIs for gemcitabine and cisplatin were 67% (54%-84%) and 74% (62%-90%), respectively. In the gemcitabine and cisplatin group, the median (IQR) RDIs for gemcitabine and cisplatin were 78% (70%-93%) and 86% (76%-95%), respectively. Discussion To our knowledge, NEXT is the first phase 3 randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the novel triplet combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel, a polyethoxylated castor oil–free polymeric micelle formulation of paclitaxel, compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. The study was terminated prematurely due to slow patient accrual, with approximately 70% of the planned participants enrolled. Our study did not meet its primary end point because the addition of polymeric micellar paclitaxel did not improve OS compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with previously untreated advanced biliary tract cancer. PFS and response rates also did not show improvement with the inclusion of polymeric micellar paclitaxel. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated, with no unexpected safety signals reported. In our study, the addition of taxanes to gemcitabine and cisplatin in advanced biliary tract cancer did not confer notable clinical benefits. These results align with a recent phase 3 trial, SWOG 1815, 20 The safety profiles of gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel were generally tolerable. The rates of grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse events were comparable between the groups, with the exception of a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group. Notably, despite the addition of taxane, no cases of grade 3 or higher peripheral sensory neuropathy, a clinically significant adverse event that affects quality of life, were observed in the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel group. Previous studies 16 17 In addition to taxanes, previous work 21 5 22 Limitations This study has limitations, including the fact that the dosage of the gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel triplet was not determined based on its own phase 1 trials, despite the existence of previous trials involving polymeric micellar paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine. 19 Nevertheless, this randomized phase 3 study demonstrated the lack of benefit from adding taxanes in the treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer in a population that differs from those in prior studies, 7 20 Conclusions In this randomized clinical trial comparing gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel with gemcitabine and cisplatin, gemcitabine and cisplatin plus polymeric micellar paclitaxel did not improve survival compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with previously untreated advanced biliary tract cancer. This study provides further evidence regarding the limitations of intensified chemotherapy with the addition of taxanes in advanced biliary tract cancer.
