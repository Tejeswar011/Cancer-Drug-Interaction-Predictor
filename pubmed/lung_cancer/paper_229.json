MUC5AC hypersecretion exacerbates airway obstruction in lung diseases, such as asthma, and promotes tumor growth. The expression of MUC5AC is driven by the pH-sensing receptor, GPR68. Herein we demonstrate that acidification (pH 6.4) increased MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression in a GPR68-dependent manner in A549 cells. Treatment with Ogremorphin (OGM), a specific GPR68 inhibitor, reduced MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression irrespective of pH. These findings were confirmed by shRNA-mediated knockdown of GPR68. These data suggest GPR68 inhibition by OGM as a potential therapy for mucus hypersecretion to improve airway clearance and reduce tumor progression in lung diseases.

GPR68 regulates MUC5AC production  (A) (B) (C) (B) (D) (E) (F) (G) (B) (D) (F) (C) (E) (G) (D) (F) (C) (E) (G) (C) (G) (E) (C) (E) (G) Description Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) and Mucin 5B (MUC5B) are gel-forming mucins maintaining airway surface hydration and are the first line of innate airway defense. MUC5AC expression is low in healthy lungs but significantly upregulated in diseased lung states (Symmes et al., 2018). Conversely, MUC5B expression remains relatively stable or decreases in diseased lung states (Symmes et al., 2018). MUC5AC is critical for mucociliary clearance, clearing inhaled particles and pathogens, as well as clearing of recruited leukocytes, dead cells, and endogenous debris (Symmes et al., 2018). However, overproduction of MUC5AC worsens or results in disease states (Symmes et al., 2018). MUC5AC overproduction is a hallmark of respiratory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, and lung cancer, as well as transient infectious or injurious responses (Krishn et al., 2018; Lakshmanan et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2013; Symmes et al., 2018). Inflammation, infection, and tumorigenesis often acidify the microenvironment driving mucus hypersecretion (Jayaraman et al., 2001; Kodric et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013; Ricciardolo et al., 2004; Sutoo et al., 2020; Szili et al., 2007). The G q Staphylococcus aureus We first sought to determine if changes in pH alter MUC5AC expression in A549 cells. MUC5AC is a 641 kDa glycoprotein complicating western blot analysis. Therefore, we devised a simple dot blot apparatus to reliably quantify protein expression (Figure A, B). Western blot analysis was used to verify equal sample loading. At an acidic pH of 6.4, both MUC5AC protein and mRNA expression are upregulated (Figure B, C). This indicates that A549 cells express MUC5AC in a pH-dependent manner. GPR68 regulates MUC5AC expression in human bronchial epithelial cells. We tested whether OGM, a GPR68 inhibitor, reduces the pH-dependent expression of MUC5AC in the human alveolar basal epithelial cell line, A549. At both pH 8.0 and pH 6.4 low concentrations of OGM inhibited MUC5AC protein production (Figure D). Concordantly, MUC5AC mRNA expression was reduced across all pHs (Figure E). At pH 6.4 MUC5AC mRNA expression was substantially lower than the DMSO control at pH 7.4. Using previously validated GPR68 shRNAs we knocked down the expression in A549 cells (Neitzel et al., 2025). MUC5AC protein expression decreased at pH 7.4 and 6.4 (Figure F). Furthermore, MUC5AC mRNA expression was reduced at pH 6.4. These data suggest chemical and genetic inhibition of GPR68 downregulates MUC5AC production in human lung cells irrespective of environmental pH. Our data confirms the findings in human bronchial epithelial cells and shows GPR68 inhibition by OGM as a potential treatment for lung diseases and cancer. Methods  Dot blot apparatus A dot blot apparatus was constructed from a p20 pipette tip box (Fig. A). The cap was removed, and scissors were used to punch a rough small hole in the side of the box. Labeling tape sealed all top openings except sample holes plus one flanking each end. A filterless p20 pipette tip with the tip cut off, was inserted tightly into the side hole and connected to a vacuum via tubing. Methanol-soaked Polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PVDF), cut with excess to optional be trimmed away post-blocking, were placed over the holes. The vacuum was adjusted until a slight divot was observed for each hole. 30 µl samples were added to the center of the divots and the vacuum was allowed to run until the sample had passed completely through the membrane. Membranes were then immediately placed in the blocking buffer.  Dot and Western blots A549 cells were cultured in DMEM with 4.5g/L D-glucose, 25 mM HEPES, GlutaMAX supplement, 10% FBS, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO 2 Protein aliquots (50 µg in 50 µl in CelLytic M) were prepared; 20 µl of the aliquot was added to 10 µls of Laemmli containing β-mercaptoethanol, both samples were boiled at 98°C for 10 mins, then cooled. The 30 µg sample was used for a dot blot. The 20 µg per 30 µl sample was run on a NuPage gel. Samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry apparatus. Dot blot and western membranes were blocked first in intercept blocking buffer (10 mins, RT) and then in 10% milk in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 mins. Dot blots were incubated with α-MUC5AC antibody (1:1000, 1 hour, RT with gentle rocking). Westerns were incubated in an α-α-tubulin antibody (1:1000, overnight, 4°C with gentle rocking). Membranes were then washed with copious amounts of PBST (5X 10 mins, with gentle rocking). They were then re-blocked (10% milk in PBST, 10 mins, with gentle rocking). HRP-Conjugated Secondary Antibody (1:1000, 1 hour, RT with gentle rocking). After washing with copious amounts of PBST (5X 10 mins, with gentle rocking) membranes were imaged on a chemidoc MP using chemiluminescence.  qRT-PCR Samples were prepared as described above for blots. Post incubation in pH-adjusted media, samples were detached with the TrypLE express enzyme. Total RNA was then collected using an RNeasy mini kit and cDNA was generated. Samples were run with TaqMan probes on a QuantStudio 7. Graphs were created in R-studio, edited in Inkscape, and statistics were calculated with R 4.4.0.
