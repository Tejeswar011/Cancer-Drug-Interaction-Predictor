Methods We screened for autoantibodies against a large number of interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines in a cross-sectional observational cohort of Swedish patients with anti-synthetase syndrome (n=51) and dermatomyositis (n=48), matched together with blood donors (n=100) from general population, using both planar and suspension-based multiplex assays. A single patient with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, type-1 (APS-1), known to harbour autoantibodies that neutralise type-I interferons, was included as a reference biological positive. The functional ability of autoantibodies to neutralise type-I interferons was tested in vitro, using an IFN-α/β responsive cell reporter assay. Result The initial screening of plasma samples indicated a repertoire of autoantibodies in IIM patients against a number of common myositis-specific and myositis-associated antigens. On screening for autoantibodies against type-I, II or III interferons, we did not find any evidence of anti-IFN autoantibodies being present in any of the IIM patient subgroups or the blood donors from general population. Additionally, none of the tested plasma samples, except the APS-1, exhibited neutralisation of physiological concentration IFN-α2, further confirming a complete lack of functional autoantibodies against IFN-α subtypes in this cohort. Conclusions We did not detect neutralising autoantibodies against IFN-α and autoantibodies against other types of IFNs in a Swedish cohort of IIM patients. These findings contrast with the presence of autoantibodies against type-I IFNs in other systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, characterised by type-I IFN overactivation.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS This study comprehensively screened for autoantibodies against type- I, II and III interferons in Swedish patients with anti-synthetase syndrome and dermatomyositis, finding no evidence of either binding or neutralising anti-IFN autoantibodies in these IIM cohorts. This contrasts with other autoimmune diseases and suggests a distinct immunological profile in IIMs. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY The absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies in IIMs may influence future biomarker and therapeutic strategies, supporting the notion that neutralising anti-IFN autoantibodies are not universally involved across all systemic autoimmune diseases. This insight helps refine disease classification and suggests the need for IIM-specific pathogenic models and treatment approaches. Introduction Type-I interferons (IFNs) play a key role in innate immunity and in antiviral response in particular. However, type-I IFNs have also been found to play a detrimental role in promoting autoimmunity by enhancing antigen presentation, stimulating the production of autoantibodies and increasing the survival of autoreactive lymphocytes. Chronic activation of type-I IFN pathways can trigger or perpetuate autoimmunity in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren’s disease (SjD) by creating a sustained inflammatory environment that disrupts self-tolerance mechanisms. 1 Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are another systemic autoimmune condition encompassing several subtypes, including dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), anti-synthetase syndrome (ASyS), inclusion body myositis (IBM) and immune-mediated necrotising myopathies (IMNM). 2 3 4 Autoantibodies against type-I IFNs can develop as a result of IFN treatment or spontaneously and have been documented across an increasing range of diseases. 5 6 7 8 We screened for potential presence of autoantibodies against type- I, II, III IFNs in a Swedish cohort of patients with ASyS (n=51) and DM (n=48), and compared them to blood donors (BDs) (n=100) from a general population. Additionally, we included a patient with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, type1 (APS-1), known to harbour autoantibodies that neutralise type-I IFNs, as a positive control. Plasma samples were screened for autoantibodies against multiple antigens, including a number of commonly observed myositis-specific autoantibody (MSA), myositis-associated autoantibody (MAA) targets, IFNs and other cytokines. We took advantage of two different multiplex screening approaches, using a planar protein microarray and a bead-based suspension assay for a rigorous investigation. The functional ability of autoantibodies to neutralise type-I IFNs, using a representative IFN-α2, was tested employing a reporter assay with IFN-α/β responsive HEK293 cell model. Patients and methods Patients and study design This was a cross-sectional observational study employing a design to identify anti-IFN autoantibody profiles in patients with ASyS and DM. The stored plasma samples were selected from a cohort followed in a specialised myositis clinic at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. IIM diagnosis was established by an experienced rheumatologist. The recruitment and sample collection of patients was carried out in the period between years 1996 and 2014 and between years 2001 and 2021 for ASyS and DM subtypes, respectively. In the case of multiple samples, the one closest to IIM diagnosis was selected. Diagnosis of ASyS was made according to Connors’ criteria: presence of an autoantibody against tRNA synthetase plus myositis, and/or Raynaud’s phenomenon and/or arthritis and/or interstitial lung disease and/or mechanic’s hands. DM patients were classified as probable or definite according to the 2017 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. 2 9 Experimental design An autoantibody profiling in the IIM cohort was conducted using a dual screening approach: (1) In-house printed planar custom microarrays containing ~500 duplicate features including autoantigens and full-length human cytokines; (2) A suspension-based Luminex assay, by coupling a subset ~95 antigens to multiple beads (please see online supplemental material 1 10 Autoantibody profiling with custom microarrays An autoantibody profiling in the IIM cohort was conducted using custom microarrays containing ~500 duplicate features including autoantigens and full-length human cytokines. On the first day, microarrays were incubated for 90 min at room temperature in 5 mL of blocking buffer (containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) to prevent non-specific binding. Patient and BD plasma samples were then diluted at a ratio of 1:2000 in the same blocking buffer and incubated with the arrays overnight (min 16 hours) at room temperature. On the following day, custom microarrays underwent five consecutive 5 min washes of wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20). Subsequently, they were transferred into a new plate for a 90 min incubation with a secondary antibody included Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:2000 dilution, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A-21445) in 5 mL of blocking buffer. After this incubation, the arrays were washed again using the same steps. As a final step, the microarrays were rinsed for 30 s with deionised water and dried using a tabletop microarray centrifuge for 30 s. Scanning was performed within 1 hour of drying using the Genepix 4000B fluorescence scanner (Axon Instruments), with image acquisition and data analysis conducted via GenePix Pro V.5.1.0.19 or GenePix Pro V.7 software using a custom microarray Genepix Array List (GAL) file. Autoantibody data from 99 patients diagnosed with IIM and 24 BD controls included in the same run was processed and analysed concurrently. Postprocessing procedures are detailed in the data analysis section below. Autoantibody positivity was defined based on two thresholds: (1) signal intensity exceeding the mean of the BD group by at least five standard deviations (mean+5 SD) and (2) a minimum mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value over 750 arbitrary units (AUs). Development of the multiplex bead assay Colour-coded magnetic beads (MagPlex, Luminex, Austin, Texas, USA) were used to immobilise a total of ninety-three antigens (see online supplemental material table 1 Autoantibody profiling with the bead-based suspension assay The plasma samples were thawed at 4°C, diluted 1:50 in an assay buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, Saveen-Werner, Limhamn, Sweden, and 5% non-fat milk, Sigma-Aldrich, in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an automated liquid handling system (EVO150, TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland). Each diluted sample was added to a 384-well microtiter plate (Greiner BioOne, Kremsmunster, Austria) containing the antigen beads and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After incubation, beads were washed in PBS-T and immunocomplexes were fixed with 0.2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Beads were then incubated with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human IgG ( H10104 Plasma IFN-α measurement with ELISA To measure the concentration of IFN-α in plasma samples, we used a commercially available kit, ELISA Pro: Human IFN-α (#3425-1HP, Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden) which is able to detect the following human IFN-α subtypes 1/13, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 16 and 17 simultaneously. In brief, we diluted the plasma samples 1:1 in ready-to-use ELISA dilution buffer from the kit and performed the experiment by carefully following the manufacturer’s guidelines. The elevated IFN-α response was determined by calculating the 98th percentile value from IFN-α levels measured in BD group, while excluding all the values below the assay’s lower limit of detection (LLOD, 2 pg/mL). IFN-α2 neutralisation reporter assay To assess IFN-α2 signalling, we employed HEK-Blue IFN-α/β cells (#hkb-ifnabv2, InvivoGen), a specialised HEK 293 cell line that exclusively responds to IFN-α/β through IFNΑR 1/2 Data analysis Data analysis and visualisation were performed using R (V.3.6.1) and RStudio (V.1.2.1335), along with packages such as BiocManager limma, tidyverse, pheatmap, viridis, patchwork, gridExtra, WriteXLS, ropls, ggplot2, ggforce, ggthemes, ggVennDiagram and reshape2 as well as custom functions for data import and quality checks. The data were acquired as MFI, expressed as AUs for both microarray and Luminex experiment. Seropositivity cut-off values were determined per antigen as the mean plus five standard deviations (rounded to the nearest integer) of the BDs for both microarray and Luminex runs. The data obtained from the cell experiment were plotted using Prism V.6.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA). The neutralisation assay using the HEK-Blue cell model and the use of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 11 12 Results Clinical characteristics of the IIM patients We collected a total of 99 plasma samples from patients with IIM (see table 1 Table 1 Clinical information and patient demographics Plasma samples Total patients Anti-synthetase syndrome Dermatomyositis n 99 51 48 Female, n (%) 65 (66) 36 (71) 29 (60) Males, n (%) 34 (34) 15 (29) 19 (40) Age (in years) at diagnosis, median (IQR) 50 (40–62) 50 (41–64) 51 (38–61) Cancer within 3 years of IIM diagnosis, n (%) 24 (24) 7 (14) 17 (35) Treatment prior to sample extraction, n (%) 37 (37) 22 (43) 19 (40) Sample extraction at diagnosis (<3 months from diagnostic date), n (%) 63 (63) 28 (55) 35 (73) IIM, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Plasma IFNα and MSA/MAA autoantibody status in IIM patients We sought to characterise a repertoire of autoantibodies against a variety of myositis-specific and myositis-associated (MSA and MAA) targets prior to assessing other potential IFN autoantibody targets with custom microarrays. Our analysis revealed an autoantibody repertoire towards the following antigens in the patients: AARS1 (PL12), EXOSC10 (PM/Scl.100), EXOSC9 (PM/Scl.75), IFIH1 (MDA5), Jo-1, La.SSB., POLR3A, RNP.Sm (RNP-Smith antigen complex), RNP.Sm.FREE (RNP, free of Smith antigen), RO.SSA, RO60, SAE1, SNRNP70, SNRPA, SNRPB, SNRPC, SNRPD3, SRP68, SRP72, SSB, TRIM21 (RO52), TRIM33 (TIF1γ). Out of these 22 autoantibodies, 13 were overlapping between ASyS and DM, while 5 and 4 were not shared between IIM subtypes (see figure 1A Figure 1 ( A B C D In parallel, plasma IFN-α levels in patients with IIM and BDs were quantified using commercially bought ELISA kits. Although the majority of samples were below the LLOD (2 pg/mL) of this ELISA assay, two patients with ASyS and three patients with DM exhibited elevated (>46.7 pg/mL) plasma IFN-α levels, whereas one BD had elevated plasma IFN-α levels (see online supplemental material figure 1 figure 1B Additionally, a supervised multivariate OPLS-DA model (see online supplemental material figure 2 figure 1C figure 1D figure 1D Effect of immunosuppressive treatment in IIM patients To investigate the impact of conventional immunosuppressive treatment (with agents such as prednisone, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil) on immunological markers, we performed a sensitivity analysis comparing treated and untreated individuals across the described 22 antigen-specific autoantibodies and type-I interferon (IFN-α) levels in plasma. We applied multiple testing correction using both the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) and the Bonferroni procedure to account for the increased risk of false positives. Among the parameters analysed, IFN-α levels (see figure 2A Figure 2 Immunosuppressive treatment-associated changes in IFN-α and Jo-1 autoantibody response levels across disease subtypes. Boxplots (top panel , A, B A’, B’ Jo-1 autoantibody signal (see figure 2 B We next assessed whether the effect of treatment varied by disease subtype (ASyS vs DM) using linear models with interaction terms. A stronger treatment effect on IFN-α levels was observed in DM, as confirmed by model diagnostics (see online supplemental material figure 3 figure 2 Collectively, these results emphasise the modulatory role of standard of care immunosuppressive treatment, particularly in downregulating IFN-α-associated pathways, and revealed disease subtype-specific responses. The integration of interaction models and multiple hypothesis corrections reinforces the robustness of our findings, while also highlighting the differential biological context of autoantibody and plasma IFN-α levels in treatment response. A lack of autoantibodies against interferons in IIM patients Next, we used a bead-based suspension assay approach to confirm potential presence or lack of autoantibodies against interferons and different cytokines and to validate a few of the common autoantibodies in patients with ASyS or DM against, for example, Jo-1, TRIM21/Ro52 (see online supplemental material table 1 figure 3A,B Figure 3 ( A 2 B C 50 On analysing the cohort for autoantibodies against type- I, II or III interferons and their corresponding immunoreactivity MFI values, we did not find any evidence of elevated anti-IFN autoantibody response in any of the patient subgroups. The presence of elevated autoantibody response against IFN- α and ω subspecies including α 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,16,17 1 13 figure 3C online supplemental material table 1 online supplemental file 3 Discussion In this study, we comprehensively investigated the presence of neutralising anti-IFN autoantibodies in patients with IIM, specifically those diagnosed with ASyS and DM using three different state-of-the-art autoantibody screening approaches. Our findings reveal a complete absence of neutralising autoantibodies against IFN-α subtypes in this Swedish cohort. This result is in stark contrast to SLE and certain other systemic autoimmune diseases, where autoantibodies targeting type-I IFNs are prevalent and can modulate disease activity. 7 8 14 7 8 The absence of neutralising autoantibodies against type-I IFNs in patients with IIM is notable, as both ASyS and DM subgroups are conditions associated with an upregulated type-I IFN signature in the circulation and in tissues. This suggests that, unlike SLE, where endogenous IFN-neutralising mechanisms have been observed, patients with IIM may lack such immune-modulating factors. Although it is worth noting that SLE is more commonly diagnosed later than IIM, particularly due to its heterogeneous and often subtle early clinical features. 15 16 17 Although our study did not directly measure IFN-β signatures or circulating IFN-β levels, prior work has suggested that IFN-β may be a dominant effector cytokine in patients with DM, particularly in tissue compartments. 18 19 20 21 22 23 The intracellular and rapid nature of IFN signalling may insulate this pathway from antibody-mediated interference. The IFNAR engagement and STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation occur swiftly at the cell membrane, offering limited extracellular antigenic exposure compared with more sustained cytokines like IL-6 or TNF. 2024 26 23 27 28 Intrinsic regulatory mechanisms such as SOCS proteins, IRF repressors and nucleic acid-sensing feedback loops are key modulators of IFN signalling that may attenuate pathway activation intracellularly, reducing the need for extracellular neutralisation. 24 29 19 30 Our findings highlight the immunosuppressive treatment-associated modulation of IFN-α and Jo-1 autoantibody response across distinct IIM subtypes, with IFN-α suppression most prominent in DM and Jo-1 autoantibody response reduction more evident in ASyS. The pronounced decline in IFN-α levels among treated patients with DM suggests that type-I interferon signalling may be a particularly treatment-responsive axis in this group, potentially reflecting differences in baseline interferon activity or tissue tropism. In contrast, Jo-1 autoantibody response, which defines a hallmark serotype in ASyS, demonstrated only modest decreases, consistent with their role as a stable disease biomarker rather than a direct effector of dynamic immune activity. Notably, the absence of detectable neutralising anti-IFN autoantibodies in both subtypes suggests that the observed treatment-related reduction in IFN-α is not confounded by inherent IFN-blocking mechanisms, thereby strengthening the interpretation that immunosuppression directly downregulates IFN-α pathway activity. However, potential biases remain, including uneven baseline IFN-α levels between subtypes and differences in treatment exposure or disease duration, which may influence treatment responsiveness. Stratifying analyses by disease subtype was critical to avoid masking these subtype-specific effects, and future studies should incorporate longitudinal profiling and mechanistic assays to disentangle primary vs secondary immunological shifts under therapy. Our findings may have important therapeutic implications. Targeting the IFN pathway has emerged as a promising strategy in autoimmune diseases, with drugs such as anifrolumab demonstrating efficacy in SLE by blocking IFN-α receptor signalling. Given that IFN-driven pathology is also implicated in IIM, it remains uncertain whether the absence of natural, neutralising anti-IFN autoantibodies influences the responsiveness of IIM patients to such therapies. Although, in myositis patients especially in DM with skin-predominant manifestations, the disease activity is driven by IFN-β, over IFN-α signatures and a monoclonal antibody, dazukirbart, selectively blocking IFN-β has shown promising effects. 31 A key limitation of our study is that it was conducted in a single cohort of Swedish patients, which may limit the generalisability of our findings to other populations with distinct genetic backgrounds or environmental exposures. Population-specific variation such as differences in HLA class II haplotypes, polymorphisms in IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and differential expression of interferon-regulatory genes may significantly influence baseline IFN activity and immune responses, including the propensity to develop anti-IFN autoantibodies. 32 34 35 36 We also acknowledge the lack of longitudinal sampling in our cohort, which precludes evaluation of temporal changes in anti-IFN autoantibody status. While such autoantibodies have been reported to be stable over time in certain contexts such as APS-1 and subsets of SLE, 14 23 37 38 Additionally, while we comprehensively screened for neutralising antibodies against multiple IFN-α subtypes, our study does not rule out other potential mechanisms of IFN modulation, such as non-neutralising autoantibodies, epitope-specific differences or intracellular regulatory pathways that might dampen signalling independently of circulating autoantibody effects. In conclusion, we report a complete absence of neutralising autoantibodies against IFN-α as well as other types of IFNs in a Swedish cohort with ASyS and DM patients. These findings contrast with the presence of autoantibodies against type-I IFNs in SLE and other systemic diseases characterised by type-I IFN overactivation. Understanding interferon status including its drivers and the presence of natural neutralising factors across disease groups is important for determining which patients are most likely to benefit from new anti-IFN treatments, such as anifrolumab and dazukirbart.
