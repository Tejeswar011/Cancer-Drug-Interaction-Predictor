Summary Neutrophils constitute a substantial proportion of the immune cell population infiltrating tumors, where they play a pivotal role in establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment to facilitate tumor growth. Our clinical investigation has unveiled that, following oncolytic virus (OV) treatment, immunosuppressive neutrophils could lead to T cell exhaustion and compromised antitumor efficacy. In this study, we devise a dual-functional conjugation strategy that enables OVs to selectively bind with circulating neutrophils and initiate their death. Prior to dysfunction, neutrophils can harbor OVs and facilitate their infiltration into tumors, leading to a 5.38-fold increase in OV levels within tumors compared to direct intravenous injection. Additionally, infiltrated neutrophils undergo dying after 8 h, which promotes T cell priming, reduces T cell exhaustion, and remodels the tumor immune microenvironment. Our findings illuminate the determinants influencing the efficacy of OVs and propose targeted solutions, thereby offering insights for the clinical translation of these therapeutic agents. Graphical abstract Highlights • Oncolytic virus (OV) treatment can recruit neutrophils to tumor tissues • Neutrophils can lead to T cell exhaustion and compromise antitumor efficacy of OVs • Depletion of neutrophils can promote antitumor efficacy of OVs Zhao et al. observe that oncolytic virus (OV) treatment can recruit neutrophils, thereby compromising antitumor efficacy. To address this, they devise the bioorthogonal oncolytic virus delivery (BOVDs) strategy, which enhances the antitumor efficacy of OVs through neutrophils depletion, alleviates T cell exhaustion, and boosts antitumor immunity, showing the potential for clinical translation of OVs.

After filtering out low-quality cells and removing doublet reads, a total of 19,428 single cells were included in the final dataset. We identified nine major cell types according to specific marker genes, including epithelial cells, neurons, stromal cells, myeloid cells, B cells, plasma cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, and T cells 30 , 31 , 32 Figures 1 S1 Figure S1 Figure 1 Figures 1 S1 + + Figures 1 S1 + Figure S2 + 33 , 34 Figure 1 Figure 1 The impact of neutrophils on the treatment of OVs (A) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot showing the clustering results of the scRNA-seq data from sample 1 and sample 2.

One-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc p p p To further corroborate the impact of neutrophils on the efficacy of OVs, the inhibitory effect of neutrophils on the antitumor potential of oncolytic adenovirus serotype (ad11) was validated through a series of experiments. TC-1 subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice were treated intratumorally with PBS, ad11 alone, or ad11 in conjunction with intraperitoneal administration of anti-Ly6G antibodies (anti-Ly6G, which depletes neutrophils) to form the combination treatment group. Remarkably, the combination therapy exhibited superior antitumor effects and conferred a long-term survival advantage compared to ad11 monotherapy ( Figures 1 S3A–S3C + Figure 1 Figure 1 + + + + + Figures 1 + + + + + + + + Figures 1 Characterization of the bioorthogonal OV delivery (BOVDs) system In light of the heightened presence of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment after OV therapy, our objective was to leverage neutrophils as vehicle to enhance the targeted delivery of OVs to tumors. However, mitigating the neutrophil-mediated antitumor immune suppression posed a significant challenge. The exhaustion-inducing impact of neutrophils on T cells was effectively mitigated through the implementation of a dual-functional bioorthogonal oncolytic virus delivery system (as illustrated in Figure 2 Figures S4 Figure 2 Schematic and characterization of BOVDs for ad11 delivery (A) Schematic showing the workflow of BOVDs.

Extending the circulation duration of the ad11 formulation holds the potential to augment the bioorthogonal reaction efficacy between ad11 and neutrophils. This was achieved by enhancing the ad11 circulation profile through the preparation of ad11-N3 using polyethylene imine and serum albumin, effectively preventing the formation of virus-protein corona as previously reported. 35 Figure S4 in vitro Figure S4 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure S4 Figure 2 Figures 2 S4 Figures S4 The function of BOVDs in vitro in vivo To optimize the in vivo Figure S5 Figures 3 S5 in vivo Figure 3 Figures 3 S5 Figures S5 Figure 3 BOVDs enable ad11 binding on the surface of neutrophils in vivo (A and B) (A) Representative flow cytometry plots and (B) quantitative results indicating the amount of dead neutrophils in the peripheral blood after TC-1 tumor-bearing mice received anti-Ly6G; data are mean ± SD, n (C) Tumors that were extracted from TC-1 tumor-bearing mice that received intravenous injections of fluorescence-labeled neutrophils, with or without anti-Ly6G after 8 h and the average radiant efficiency of the tumors Data are mean ± SD, n (D) Total radiant efficiency from the tumors in the mice receiving fluorescence-labeled neutrophils, with or without anti-Ly6G-DBCO, at each time points in vivo n (E) Representative flow cytometry plots and quantitative results indicating the amount of ad11 binding on the surface of neutrophils in ad@Lip and BOVDs groups in vivo (F) Representative confocal images of neutrophils extracted from TC-1 subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice after ad@Lip or BOVDs treatment.

To harness the tumor-homing capabilities of neutrophils while effectively managing their clearance, we have introduced the innovative BOVDs strategy. This approach not only tackles the issue of neutrophil-mediated viral clearance but also capitalizes on the intrinsic immune functions of these cells. Neutrophils, as crucial components of the innate immune system, exhibit the capacity to phagocytose viruses and combat infections, potentially compromising the effectiveness of OVs. 41 , 42 While we have undertaken functional validations regarding the impact of neutrophils on OVs, a deeper exploration into the underlying molecular mechanisms is essential to enrich our understanding of the role of neutrophils in OV therapy. Notably, the literature suggests that neutrophils play a key role in eliminating infectious agents, including viruses, from the bloodstream. 42 In the context of clinical translation, the BOVDs strategy offers a promising avenue that necessitates only intermittent injections to bolster the antitumor efficacy of OVs. Notably, the current clinical landscape predominantly integrates OVs with immune checkpoint inhibitors like Opdivo and Keytruda, encompassing anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies, aligning with NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines. 43 , 44 , 45 46 Limitations of the study Our study has certain limitations, primarily due to the restricted number of clinical samples, which hindered a more comprehensive analysis of the interaction between myeloid cells and the OV. Furthermore, the safety of BOVDs has been validated exclusively in small animal models. The absence of experimental data from larger animals or human trials represents an additional limitation of this study.

Method details Single-cell RNA sequencing Human sample collection: The specimens were derived from a colon metastasis of a 55-year-old male patient with gastric cancer who before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) received additional oncolytic virus therapy toward his colon metastasis (Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2300069323). Mice sample collection: Mice intravenously received PBS, ad11-N3, or BOVDs treatment for six times with two-day interval. 12 days after the first injection, mice were sacrificed and tumors were collected. After preparing single-cell suspensions from tumor tissues of five mice that received identical treatments, the suspensions were thoroughly mixed. Subsequently, CD45 + + Cell capture and cDNA synthesis: Cell capture and complementary DNA (cDNA) amplification and library construction was performed on the 10x Genomics Chromium Platform. Briefly, the single cell suspension counted by Count Star, was loaded onto the Chromium single-cell controller (10x Genomics) to generate single-cell gel beads in an emulsion. The cells were partitioned into GEM to achieve single cell resolution. Captured cells were lysed and their released RNA was barcoded through reverse transcription in individual GEMs. The resulting cDNA was amplified, and its quality assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer system (performed by CapitalBio Technology, Beijing). Single Cell 5′ Library and Gel Bead Kit V3 were utilized for constructing single-cell RNA-seq libraries. The libraries were submitted to an Illumina Novaseq6000 (Illumina) and pair-end (150 bp) sequencing was performed. scRNA-seq data processing Raw scRNA-seq data were processed using Cell Ranger Software (version 4.0.0, 10x Genomics). For human samples, the sequenced raw read data were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh38. For mouse samples, the sequenced data was applied to align reads to the mouse reference genome GRCm38(mm10). The raw gene expression matrix was converted into a Seurat object via Seurat R package (V5.2.1). 52 48 51 30 , 53 54 Preparation of ad11 formulations Liposome were formulated utilizing a thin-film hydration process as previously described. 55 8 8 Preparation of anti-Ly6G-DBCO The anti-Ly6G antibodies were dissolved in 0.1 M NaHCO 3 g 3 Dual color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy The anti-Ly6G-DBCO-FITC at a concentration of 0.2 nM and ad11-Cy5.5-N3 at a concentration of 0.6 nM were dispersed in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to facilitate the click reaction. The DBCO-omitting group and N3-omitting group were employed as the control groups. The conjugation efficiency of the reaction was assessed by quantifying the relative cross-correlation amplitudes. Intravital imaging The in vivo 56 7 Isolation of neutrophils The neutrophils were freshly isolated from bone marrow of tumor bearing mice using immunomagnetic negative selection. Mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide overdose. Two hindlimb bones (femur and tibia) were collected, followed by thorough removal of excess muscle tissue and sterilization using 70% ethanol. Subsequently, the epiphyses were sectioned to allow flushing with PBS, and cells were obtained through centrifugation. Neutrophils were isolated from bone marrow cells utilizing the Mouse Neutrophil Enrichment Kit (Miltenyi Biotec), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time quantitative PCR The real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was performed according to previously described methods. 57 Cellular uptake assay Neutrophils were initially incubated with PBS, anti-Ly6G, and anti-Ly6G-DBCO for a duration of 2 h under 37°C. Subsequently, the cells underwent multiple washing steps with PBS before being incubated with ad11-N3 for an additional 2 h. Following thorough washing, the cellular uptake of ad11-N3 was quantified using qPCR (Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3.0, ThermoFisher).
