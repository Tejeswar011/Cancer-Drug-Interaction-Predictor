See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Primary liver cancer is the sixth most prevalent malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. According to the latest data from the National Cancer Center of China, its mortality rate has risen, making it the country’s second-deadliest tumor. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predominant histological subtype, remains a substantial therapeutic challenge. Hepatectomy is the treatment of choice for HCC; however, because of its insidious onset and aggressive progression, the global 5-year survival rate is only 14.1%, and up to 70% of patients experience recurrence within five years after surgery. Consequently, reducing postoperative recurrence and prolonging survival have become critical research priorities. Currently, no consensus or guidelines exist regarding the clinical efficacy or potential synergistic effects of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent postoperative recurrence. In recent years, interest has grown in systemic therapies and combined local modalities - particularly targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, as adjuvant treatments. This review synthesizes recent advances in targeted and immunotherapeutic adjuvant therapies for postoperative HCC to inform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes.

China accounted for nearly half of these cases, with 410000 new diagnoses (45.3% of the global total) and 390000 deaths (47.1%), the highest numbers globally[ 1 2 3 4 5 et al 6 Postoperative adjuvant therapy seeks to prevent tumor recurrence after curative treatment, thereby improving patient survival[ 7 8 9 11 Recurrence is the principal obstacle to successful HCC management, markedly limiting the benefits of surgery and worsening patient prognosis. Identifying high-risk factors and implementing suitable adjuvant strategies are therefore critical. Recurrence follows a bimodal pattern, peaking at 1-2 years (early recurrence) and again at 4-5 years (late recurrence) after resection[ 12 14 1 https://www.cellsignal.cn/ et al 15 16 17 Figure 1  Mechanism of tumor angiogenesis. www.cellsignal.com Supplementary material Three broad categories of recurrence risk factors have been identified: Tumor-related characteristics, surgical variables, and patient-specific features. Early recurrence is primarily linked to tumor biology and surgical parameters, whereas late recurrence is more closely associated with the status of the underlying liver disease. Key independent predictors of early recurrence include large tumor diameter (> 5 cm), portal vein thrombosis, microvascular invasion (MVI), and peritumoral infiltration[ 18 22 23 29 POSTOPERATIVE ADJUVANT THERAPY STRATEGIES To date, convincing evidence that adjuvant therapy can prevent postoperative HCC recurrence or metastasis is lacking. Nonetheless, several modalities are in use, and multiple promising approaches are under active investigation. Current research focuses on systemic antitumor agents - such as targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) - and localized treatments, including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiotherapy, evaluated both individually and in combination. When selecting an adjuvant regimen, clinicians should weigh safety, efficacy, adverse event profiles, and real-world data. Muñoz-Martínez et al 30 2 Figure 2  Hepatocellular carcinoma treatment options[ 30 n X Curr Opin Pharmacol https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=ELS&contentID=S1471489221001028&orderBeanReset=true TACE TACE is a widely used locoregional therapy for intermediate to advanced stage HCC, yet its efficacy as an adjuvant treatment after curative resection remains uncertain. Large studies suggest that prophylactic TACE may improve disease-free survival (DFS) in high-risk patients, particularly those with MVI or a substantial tumor burden[ 31 et al 32 et al 33 Conversely, other evidence calls these benefits into question. In a 2020 prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), Hirokawa et al 34 n n vs P et al 35 n P et al 36 Growing evidence shows that adjuvant TACE lowers recurrence rates and extends survival in HCC patients with high-risk features, and emerging data suggest that combining TACE with systemic agents may further enhance outcomes in this population. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy The 2023 Chinese expert consensus[ 8 et al 37 Radiotherapy Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive thermal technique that destroys tumors through localized heating. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for hepatic indications, RFA has become the first-line ablative therapy worldwide for both primary and metastatic liver malignancies[ 38 39 40 41 Current evidence for adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy in HCC is limited and inconclusive. Few RCTs have assessed this approach, and results have been inconsistent. A retrospective analysis by Zhu et al 42 et al 43 Paradoxically, some evidence indicates that RFA itself may increase the risk of HCC recurrence. In addition to residual micro metastases, hypoxia-driven pathways triggered after ablation can enhance tumor invasiveness[ 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 Molecular targeted therapy The therapeutic landscape of HCC shifted in 2007 with the approval of sorafenib, inaugurating molecular targeted therapy. Subsequent agents - regorafenib, lenvatinib, and cabozantinib - have further expanded treatment options.

However, most available evidence comes from small retrospective series. Although high-quality trials that directly demonstrate a survival benefit are still lacking, the existing data suggest that these agents may offer meaningful clinical value as adjuvant therapy for carefully selected high-risk patients. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy, particularly programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, has reshaped HCC treatment by enhancing immune recognition of tumor cells. Clinical trials (CheckMate040, KEYNOTE224) have shown significant survival benefits in advanced disease, and emerging evidence indicates potential in the adjuvant setting. Huang et al 63 64 In a phase 2 study (UMIN000026648), adjuvant nivolumab achieved a 78.6% 1-year RFS rate and a median RFS of 26.3 months in high-risk patients[ 65 et al 66 vs vs P vs P Collectively, these findings highlight immunotherapy as a potentially transformative option for both advanced and postoperative HCC management, although further validation in large, randomized trials is warranted. Wang et al 67 vs P et al 68 vs P vs P P P The heterogeneous clinical efficacy of ICIs is largely attributed to therapeutic resistance. Primary resistance mechanisms include[ 69 71 Current evidence indicates that immunotherapy holds promise as an adjuvant strategy for HCC, but most data originate from small retrospective studies. These preliminary findings must be validated in large, multicenter prospective trials to confirm therapeutic efficacy and optimize treatment protocols. Combination therapy  Targeted combination immunotherapy: 72 73 74 P Camrelizumab is an antitumor agent developed independently in China. It belongs to the immunoglobulin CD28/B7 superfamily and comprises 288 amino acids. As a type I transmembrane protein, its extracellular segment contains an extracellular domain, a hydrophobic hinge region, and a cytoplasmic tail, together functioning as an immunosuppressive receptor. Xia et al 75 et al 76 Several multicenter RCTs are investigating combination immunotherapy for HCC patients at high risk of recurrence after radical resection: Ongoing studies include durvalumab plus bevacizumab (EMERALD-2, NCT03847428 NCT04682210 NCT04639180 NCT05564338  TACE combined with immunotherapy: et al 77 vs vs P vs vs P et al 78 CHEMOTHERAPY Research on postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for HCC remains limited. Zhu et al 42 TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE Huaier granule, a fungal extract preparation, has demonstrated clinical activity as either monotherapy or combination therapy in several malignancies, including breast, colon, gastric, and lung cancers; HCC; leukemia; and osteosarcoma[ 79 80 82 Chen et al 83 vs P vs P vs P 84 ADOPTIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY Adoptive immunotherapy (AIT) improves the prognosis of HCC by activating immune responses against tumor cells. Current AIT strategies primarily employ lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells[ 85 Evidence on adjuvant LAK therapy is mixed. Kawata et al 86 87 88 et al 89 Two additional investigations confirmed the efficacy of CIK therapy in HCC. In a multicenter phase III trial, Lee et al 90 vs P et al 91 P CONCLUSION Postoperative adjuvant therapy for HCC remains an active field of investigation, but substantial controversies and challenges persist. To date, no universally accepted regimen reliably prevents recurrence and metastasis, and the optimal strategy is still debated. A primary challenge is accurately identifying patients at high risk for relapse - a group most likely to benefit from adjuvant treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that triple-agent combinations may surpass dual-agent regimens; however, adding additional agents does not automatically translate into superior outcomes. Further studies are required to refine such combinations. Future work should prioritize: (1) Individualizing therapy according to each tumor’s molecular and clinical profile; and (2) Discovering biomarkers that predict treatment response. These advances will improve patient selection and enhance the efficacy of perioperative and adjuvant interventions.
