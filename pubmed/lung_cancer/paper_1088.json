We describe a patient with squamous cell carcinoma who developed bilateral calf swelling postoperatively. While ultrasound revealed right popliteal vein thrombosis, a left calf hypoechoic lesion exhibited marked hypervascularity on contrast‐enhanced and microvascular flow imaging, ultimately diagnosed as metastasis. This case illustrates a critical diagnostic pitfall and advocates for contrast‐enhanced ultrasound in evaluating ambiguous limb lesions during cancer care. calf swelling contrast‐enhanced ultrasound lung cancer skeletal muscle metastasis pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  Y.

Clinicians should consider metastatic disease in patients with unexplained muscle masses and a history of malignancy. Contrast‐enhanced ultrasound provides a valuable complementary imaging modality, enhancing early detection of atypical metastases. 1 Background Lung cancer (LC) demonstrates remarkable metastatic potential, though skeletal muscle metastasis (SMM) represents a rare manifestation, comprising only 0.1%–2% of metastatic cases. This apparent rarity contrasts sharply with autopsy findings revealing a 16%–17.5% prevalence, a discrepancy likely attributable to SMM's frequently nonspecific clinical and radiographic presentation [ 1 2 Case Presentation A 58‐year‐old male patient underwent left lower lung resection for lung cancer 2 years ago. The postoperative staging was IA (T1aN0M0), and the pathological diagnosis was lung squamous cell carcinoma, with a lesion size of approximately 3 × 2 × 2 cm, infiltrating the surrounding lung tissue but without pleural involvement. Lymph nodes submitted for examination showed no metastasis. Pleural metastasis was diagnosed more than 9 months post‑surgery. After 17 months, a PET‐CT scan revealed metastasis to the supraclavicular lymph nodes and right parietal lobe. He underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for the lesions and was given chemotherapy. Two years post‐surgery, during inpatient chemotherapy, the patient developed bilateral calf swelling, and the clinicians suspected deep vein thrombosis in the calves. Lower limb venous ultrasound showed right‐sided peroneal vein thrombosis. In the left calf, an elongated hypoechoic area approximately 9.2 × 2.5 cm was found within the soleus muscle, with uneven internal echogenicity, unclear boundaries, and irregular shape. Color Doppler Flow Imaging (CDFI) showed blood flow signals within the lesion, and superb microvascular imaging (SMI) indicated blood flow signals (Figure 1 2 3 FIGURE 1 (A) Hypoechoic area within the calf muscles, with unclear borders and irregular shape. (B) CDFI shows strip‐like blood flow signals within the lesion. (C) SMI demonstrates blood flow signals within the lesion; (D) Pulsed Wave Doppler (PW) shows a high‐speed, low‐resistance blood flow spectrum within the lesion.

Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen confirmed the presence of tumor tissue within the muscle, which was diagnostic of squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical results: CK5/6 (partial +), Ki‐67 (60% +), Vimentin (partial +), P63 (+), P40 (+), P53 (+), CK (+), TTF‐1 (−), Napsin A (−), S‐100 (−), Caldesmon (−), Desmin (−), Myoglobin (−). 3 Treatment and Follow‐Up The patient subsequently underwent antitumor therapy with docetaxel combined with nedaplatin and anticoagulation therapy with rivaroxaban. After 10 days, the lower limb edema showed no significant improvement. A repeat lower extremity venous ultrasound revealed multiple patchy hypoechoic areas with indistinct borders and irregular shapes within the muscle layers of both thighs and calves (Figure 4 FIGURE 4 (A) Ultrasonographic image of multiple metastatic lesions in the left thigh.

(D) SMI of metastatic lesions in the right calf. 4 Discussion and Conclusion Although muscle tissue occupies a large area of the body and has an abundant blood supply, SMM from LC is relatively rare. This is closely related to factors such as changes in local blood supply caused by muscle contraction and the acidic environment generated by lactate production [ 2 3 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 TABLE 1 Clinical manifestations and imaging diagnostic methods of lower limb muscle metastases from lung cancer: A literature review.

The ultrasound appearance of muscle metastases varies depending on the characteristics of the primary disease. According to literature, most metastases appear as heterogeneous hypoechoic lesions (98.6%) with clear borders (85.9%). The shape of the lesions is predominantly round or oval (47.9%), followed by lobulated and irregular shapes (42.2%). The blood flow signal within the lesions is relatively rich (64.8%) [ 9 10 CEUS plays a crucial role in differentiating skeletal muscle metastases from benign lesions such as intramuscular or intermuscular hematomas, intramuscular abscesses, and myositis ossificans by demonstrating distinct microvascular perfusion patterns. Acute hematomas show a complete absence of enhancement, while chronic hematomas exhibit patchy enhancement due to neovascularization, abscesses display characteristic peripheral rim enhancement surrounding central necrosis, and myositis ossificans presents with central non‐enhancement and peripheral eggshell‐like enhancement, enabling reliable discrimination from the disorganized vascular patterns typical of metastatic lesions [ 11 In diagnosing lower extremity muscle metastases in this case, while multimodal ultrasound provided valuable diagnostic assistance and successfully guided needle biopsy, certain limitations were evident. Current evidence demonstrates that combining multiple imaging modalities significantly improves diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, MRI offers superior soft tissue resolution, enabling more sensitive detection of intramuscular microhemorrhages and tumor infiltration, whereas ultrasound, despite its portability, remains operatordependent and limited by tissue characteristics. In this case, the similarity of symptoms to deep vein thrombosis precluded comprehensive multimodal evaluation. These findings suggest an optimized diagnostic pathway for similar cases: initial ultrasound screening followed by MRI for definitive characterization, with selective biopsy as needed. This approach would minimize invasive procedures while enhancing diagnostic precision, aligning with the principle of multimodality emphasized in virtopsy research [ 12 5 Conclusion This case underscores the diagnostic dilemma of SMM in LC, particularly when its clinical presentation closely mimics DVT. CEUS emerges as a crucial diagnostic tool by demonstrating pathognomonic enhancement patterns, including rapid heterogeneous hyperenhancement, lesion expansion, ill‐defined margins, and prominent penetrating vessels, which collectively facilitate reliable differentiation between metastatic lesions and thrombi. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for SMM in cancer patients presenting with unexplained limb swelling, particularly when unresponsive to anticoagulation therapy. Multicenter collaborative studies are imperative to establish evidence‐based, standardized CEUS diagnostic criteria for muscular metastases.
