However, accurate dosimetry and quality assurance (QA) for FLASH remain challenging due to the extreme dose rates involved. Developing reliable calibration and QA procedures is crucial for advancing FLASH towards clinical implementation. Purpose To present an effective routine calibration and QA procedure for proton FLASH delivery to ensure high‐quality dosimetry performance for preclinical and clinical delivery. Methods A high temporospatial resolution strip ionization chamber array (SICA) detector was mounted to the treatment nozzle, which was calibrated using an Advanced Markus ion chamber (IC) under variable dose and ultra‐high dose rates. The calibration curve was used to monitor the delivery in real‐time. The maximum beam current was 215 nA at the isocenter at the highest energy of the cyclotron (250 MeV). Third‐party IROC (Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core) thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were requested to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the calibration and validation procedure. A transmission field with a field size of 3 × 3 cm 2 Results The entire calibration process took less than 10 minutes as part of routine daily QA. The calibration curve between the SICA detector and IC demonstrated an R Conclusion As demonstrated by IROC measurements, effective calibration and QA using a SICA detector for proton FLASH delivery can ensure high accuracy in real‐time dose and dose rate monitoring, paving the way for future clinical applications. calibration credentialing FLASH radiotherapy pencil beam scanning quality assurance (QA) pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  Chang C‐C Selvaraj B Zhao X First experience with third‐party validations: A robust calibration and QA procedure for proton FLASH delivery J Appl Clin Med Phys 2025 26 e70269 10.1002/acm2.70269 41014172 Chih‐Chiang Chang and Balaji Selvaraj contributed equally to this study. 1 INTRODUCTION FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH‐RT) has emerged as a promising advance in radiation therapy, delivering ultra‐high dose rates (UHDRs) typically greater than 40 Gy/s.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 While most preclinical data reporting FLASH effects have been conducted with electron radiation, the clinical translation of FLASH‐RT using electrons is inherently limited in treating deep‐seated tumors and large target volumes. Electron‐based FLASH‐RT is limited by the physical properties of electron interactions, including energy loss through Coulomb interactions with orbital electrons and angular deflection through Coulomb interactions with nuclei, which together restrict its penetration depth and efficacy for deep‐seated targets.  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16 Accurate dosimetry in proton PBS FLASH‐RT is critical due to the unique spatiotemporal correlation of the delivered radiation.  6  13  14  17  18  19  13  14  13  14  20  21  22  22 40Gy/s  15  23 Addressing these challenges, a novel two‐dimensional (2D) parallel‐plate strip ionization chamber array (SICA) has been introduced.  6  13  14  13  24  14 This technical note presents an effective routine calibration and quality assurance (QA) procedure for proton FLASH delivery, designed to ensure high‐quality dosimetry performance in both preclinical and clinical settings. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed procedure have been validated through third‐party validation, further demonstrating its reliability and robustness. These advancements underscore the critical role of innovative detector technologies and dedicated research infrastructures in the successful clinical translation of proton FLASH‐RT, paving the way for more effective and safer cancer treatments. 2 METHOD 2.1 Experimental setup The FLASH delivery mode utilized 250 MeV proton beams, the highest energy of our ProBeam system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA), which has been previously commissioned for proton FLASH animal irradiation studies.  6  13  14 1  13  25  26  27 2 FIGURE 1 (a) The SICA was mounted onto the nozzle and calibrated using an Advanced Markus ion chamber. An EBT‐XD film was used to ensure the chamber was positioned at the field center; (b) the daily calibration curve was obtained with a proton transmission beam of 250MeV under beam currents from 100 to 215 nA. 2.2 Dose calibration and validation The SICA detector was positioned at the beam path during FLASH irradiation to measure real‐time dose and dose rate using proprietary software developed in‐house. The detector's operating principle involves collecting ionization‐induced charges at individual electrodes, amplifying these signals, and converting them to digital format through analog‐to‐digital processing to produce SICA readings (Figure 1b X Y These one‐dimensional signal profiles serve as input for a convolution superposition algorithm that reconstructs two‐dimensional dose distributions.  13  28 X Y X Y The final step combines the reconstructed dose maps with their corresponding temporal information to generate spatial dose rate distributions across the beam profile. To ensure absolute dose accuracy, we used measurements from an Advanced Markus chamber to calibrate the SICA detector signals to isocenter dose values at various dose and dose rate levels (Figure 1b 2.3 Dose rate quantification For dose rate analysis, we examined both FADR and LADR. FADR was calculated by dividing the central axis dose by the total time used to deliver the entire field, representing the most conservative measurement method.  14  6  14  23 D L A D R ( x ⃗ ) = D ( x ⃗ ) − 2 d ′ t 1 − t 0 D ( x ⃗ ) x D L A D R ( x ⃗ ) x t 0 t 1 D ( x ⃗ ) − d ′ t 1 − t 0 D ( x ⃗ ) − 2 d ′ PBS delivers radiation as a series of individually targeted beam spots, in contrast to scattering‐based techniques that irradiate the entire field uniformly and simultaneously. This sequential delivery adds complexity to dose rate assessment. The LADR metric accounts for the detailed time structure of beam delivery—including individual spot times, scanning intervals, and the cumulative dose and duration received by each region of interest. Compared to other definitions,  14  22  23 The log files contained time‐stamped records of various machine parameters, including spot beam‐on time, spot position, and MUs delivered. An in‐house analytical program was developed to reconstruct the dose rate using these log file records. The program extracted the delivered spot positions, spot weights, and delivery timing sequence to generate a four‐dimensional dose rate matrix. This reconstruction approach accounts for the temporal and spatial variations in dose delivery, enabling a comprehensive characterization of the treatment process. The reconstructed dose rate distributions were subsequently compared with the SICA measured dose rate distributions to evaluate the accuracy of the delivery system and to verify the consistency between planned and delivered treatments. 2.4 IROC validation To validate our calibration and QA performance, we requested Image and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) for dose validation.  29  30 2 2 3 RESULT 3.1 Dose calibration and validation Validation measurements of the calibrated dose measured by the SICA at a proton beam current of 215 nA using the one‐shot setup are presented in Figure 1a R 2 To quantify the precision of dose delivery, the ratio of IROC TLD measured doses to the planned doses for each of the four Field Average Dose Rate (FADR) values was calculated (Figure 2 FIGURE 2 The planned and IROC TLD measured dose comparison under 4 different FADR dose rates: 36, 53, 70, and 76.5 Gy/s. Each dose rate used two blocks with a total of 6 readings to confirm the delivered dose. 3.2 Dose distribution of SICA and film Figure 3 3a,b X Y 3c,d FIGURE 3 The film was used to compare the SICA measurement for the 2D and line dose profile. (a) SICA 2D dose distribution, (b) EBT‐XD film 2D dose, (c) X‐profile (SICA vs. EBT‐XD), (d) Y‐profile (SICA vs. EBT‐XD). 3.3 Quantification of 2‐D dose rate The LADR method calculates the dose rate for individual voxels by determining the ratio of the delivered dose to the duration of significant dose accumulation, which occurs when the pencil beam is near the voxel under consideration. Figure 4 4e–h FIGURE 4 The 2D dose rate distribution of SICA using the local average dose rate method. (a)–(d) show the dose rate distributions for beam currents of 100, 150, 200, and 215 nA, respectively. (e)–(f) show the corresponding LADR dose rate histograms. LADR above 40 Gy/s is indicated by the vertical dashed lines. Histograms only included voxels exceeding a 10% dose threshold. Subsequently, the dose rate reconstruction analysis was conducted for both the treatment log file and the SICA measurement at a beam current of 100 nA (Figure 5 FIGURE 5 Dose rate reconstruction of the (a) SICA and (b) log file measurement for 100 nA delivery. (c) the gamma passing rate distribution, and (d) the line profile (red dotted line in panel a) comparison between the log file and measurement. This one‐dimensional analysis provided detailed insights into the spatial variations of dose rate agreement. The line profiles exhibited close alignment in the central regions of the field, with little discrepancy noted towards the field boundaries. These discrepancies may be attributed to factors such as beam penumbra effects, positioning uncertainties, or limitations in the detection system's spatial resolution. The collective analysis of the dose rate reconstructions, gamma passing rate distribution, and line profile comparisons offers a comprehensive assessment of the treatment delivery accuracy. These results underscore the importance of rigorous QA procedures in advanced radiotherapy techniques, particularly when employing high dose rates that approach or exceed the FLASH threshold. 4 DISCUSSION In this work, we present an effective routine calibration and QA procedure for proton FLASH delivery designed to ensure high‐quality dosimetry performance in both preclinical and clinical settings. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed procedure have been verified through third‐party credentialing, further demonstrating its reliability and robustness. This verification process underscores the potential of the procedure to be adopted widely, facilitating consistent and accurate dosimetry, that is a current technology gap but essential for the success of future proton FLASH clinical trials. Absolute dosimetry in proton FLASH delivery poses significant challenges, primarily due to the need for high spatiotemporal resolution detectors. These detectors are crucial for capturing the rapid dose delivery characteristic of FLASH‐RT. However, the availability of such detectors is currently limited, posing a barrier to achieving the desired precision in dosimetric measurements and QA.  31 Additionally, the SICA system, while a valuable tool for monitoring, is not yet an active component integrated into the delivery system. Its current function is limited to providing monitoring capabilities without the ability to control the delivery process. This limitation restricts its utility in real‐time dosimetric adjustments during treatment, emphasizing the need for further development to integrate active control features. Such advancements would enhance the capability of SICA to not only monitor but also dynamically adjust the dosimetry, ensuring even greater accuracy and safety in proton FLASH delivery. While our workflow incorporates SICA technology for enhanced precision, we recognize the importance of providing approaches for diverse institutional settings. For institutions without access to SICA technology, we propose two complementary strategies: (1) implementation of multi‐detector validation protocols where measurements from different detector types (e.g., radiochromic film and small‐volume ionization chambers) are cross‐verified to ensure consistency in the absence of SICA's precision,  17 Overall, the proposed QA procedure for proton FLASH delivery demonstrates significant potential in enhancing dosimetric accuracy and reliability. However, the challenges associated with absolute dosimetry and the current limitations of the SICA system indicate areas where further technological advancements are necessary. Continued innovation in detector technology and the integration of active control mechanisms into monitoring systems like SICA will be essential to fully realize the benefits of proton FLASH therapy in clinical practice. 5 CONCLUSION This technical note successfully establishes a robust and effective calibration and QA procedure for proton FLASH delivery, ensuring high passing rates and validation by third‐party credentialing bodies. The findings demonstrate that the dose can be delivered with remarkable accuracy, with the agreement between planned and delivered doses consistently within 1%. This high level of precision provides a solid reference in dosimetry, which is crucial for the advancement of future clinical trial applications. These results demonstrated the reliability and efficacy of the proposed methods, paving the way for their broader adoption in clinical settings and contributing to the enhancement of proton FLASH‐RT preclinical and clinical applications.
