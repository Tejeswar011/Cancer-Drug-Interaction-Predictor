However, whether DR882MUT modulates AML progression via circRNAs remains unknown. Methods Bioinformatics was used to assess the aberrant expression of circRNAs associated with AML. The DR882MUT cell line model was established. circRNA expression in AML cells treated with DR882MUT was analyzed using RT-qPCR. The CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were used to measure cell proliferation and apoptosis in DR882MUT AML cells after transfection with si-circKCNQ5. The regulatory mechanism of DR882MUT in circKCNQ5 transcription was studied by bisulfite sequencing and ChIP assays. Results Bioinformatics analysis revealed four abnormally expressed circRNAs associated with AML. Among these, circKCNQ5 was most significantly upregulated in DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells; therefore, circKCNQ5 was selected for this study. circKCNQ5 knockdown remarkably restrained the proliferation and facilitated the apoptosis of DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells compared to cells transfected with si-NC. Moreover, circKCNQ5 knockdown in DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells effectively impeded the total volume and weight of subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo compared to that in cells transfected with si-NC. Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing indicated that the circKCNQ5 promoter methylation level in DR882MUT AML cells was remarkably lower than that in DNMT3A DR882 wild-type AML cells. DR882MUT induced circKCNQ5 transcription by weakening circKCNQ5 promoter methylation. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) recruited DNMT3A R882 wild-type (DR882WT) to enhance circKCNQ5 methylation. Conclusion DR882MUT promotes AML progression by inhibiting circKCNQ5 methylation to upregulate circKCNQ5 expression. DR882WT enhanced circKCNQ5 methylation, which requires EZH2 participation.

Next, AML cell lines overexpressing DR882MUT were constructed, and circKCNQ5 expression and its role in DR882MUT AML cell lines were analyzed. Then, the effects of circKCNQ5 on DR882MUT AML cells were also assessed. Finally, the possible molecular mechanism of how DR882MUT modulates circKCNQ5 transcription was discussed. Methods Bioinformatics analyses The online databases circRNADisease, circad, and lncRNADisease were used to assess the aberrant expression of circRNAs associated with AML. Cell culture, DR882MUT cell lines establish, and transfection AML DNMT3A R882 wild-type (DR882WT) cells [ 26 2 27 RT-qPCR Total RNA from the cells was separated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA concentration was determined. Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and PCR was performed using an ABI PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences used were as follows: circKCNQ5 forward: 5′-TGCAACCTGGAAGCCACAC-3′, reverse: 5′-AGCCTGCAGAAAGCAATCTT-3′. GAPDH forward: 5′-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3′, reverse: 5′-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3′. Fold changes in the transcripts were determined using the 2 −ΔΔCT Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cycle assays Cell viability assays were conducted using the CCK-8 method. The OD at 450 nm in each well was measured using a microplate reader after culturing the cells for 48 h. Apoptosis was analyzed using an Annexin V-FITC/PI Cell Apoptosis Detection Kit (KeyGen Biotech, Jiangsu, China). After culture for 48 h, the cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and PI, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the dark. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry (BD). Finally, cell cycle analysis was conducted using a Cell Cycle Detection Kit (KeyGen Biotech). After culture for 48 h, the cells were stained with PI, incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the dark, and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD). Animal experiments 8-week-old male BALB/C nude mice ( n n n n Bisulfite sequencing Bisulfite sequencing was performed as described previously [ 27 ChIP assay Notably, 5 × 10 6 Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 22.0. Data are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical differences were assessed using t P Results circKCNQ5 was elevated in DR882MUT AML cells This study searched the circRNADisease, circad, and lncRNADiseases databases for all circRNAs associated with “acute myeloid leukemia” or “AML.” The circRNADisease, circad, and lncRNADiseases databases contained 7, 13, and 6 circRNAs associated with AML, respectively. Subsequently, the circRNAs found in the three databases were intersected, which resulted in the identification of four circRNAs: hsa_circ_0017446, hsa_circ_0035381, hsa_circ_0004136, and hsa_circ_0058058 (Fig. 1 1 1  Fig. 1 The circKCNQ5 (circ_0004136) associated with DR882MUT was screened. A B C B C D circKCNQ5 knockdown impeded proliferation and facilitated apoptosis of DR882MUT AML cells To explore the functional effects of circKCNQ5 on DR882MUT AML cells, we transfected them with si-circKCNQ5 or si-NC. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that circKCNQ5 expression were both remarkably impeded in DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells after transfection with si-CIRCKCNQ5 compared to that in the si-NC group (Fig. 2 2 2 2  Fig. 2 circKCNQ5 knockdown impeded proliferation and facilitated apoptosis of DR882MUT AML cells. A B C D E F ***P circKCNQ5 knockdown impeded DR882MUT AML cell tumor growth in vivo To investigate whether circKCNQ5 knockdown in DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells could also exert a more effective antitumor function in vivo, DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells with circKCNQ5 knockdown were injected subcutaneously into mice to establish a tumor xenograft model. Tumor volume was monitored at 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 days. The mice were euthanized on day 30 and the tumors were removed and weighed. circKCNQ5 knockdown in DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells effectively impeded the total volume and weight of subcutaneous tumor growth compared to si-NC-transfected DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Efficacy of circKCNQ5 knockdown in DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells on tumor growth in tumor xenografts. A n B C D ***P DR882MUT induced circKCNQ5 transcription by weakening the methylation of the circKCNQ5 promoter To explore the mechanism of how DR882MUT regulates circKCNQ5 transcription in KG-1a cells, we examined the methylation level of the circKCNQ5 promoter CpG island in DR882WT and DR882MUT KG-1a cells. The methylation level of the circKCNQ5 promoter in DR882MUT KG-1a cells was markedly lower than that in DR882WT KG-1a cells (Fig. S1). Next, DR882WT overexpression was used to investigate its effect on circKCNQ5 expression and DR882MUT AML cellular functions. DR882WT overexpression (ov-DNMT3A group) significantly enhanced circKCNQ5 methylation, inhibited circKCNQ5 expression and proliferation, enhanced G1 cell cycle accumulation, and promoted apoptosis of DNMT3A-DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells (Fig. 4 4 5  Fig. 4 DR882WT overexpression enhanced circKCNQ5 methylation and inhibited circKCNQ5 expression and proliferation in DNMT3A-DR882MUT cells, which was reversed by circKCNQ5 overexpression.

The effect of DNMT3A and circKCNQ5 co-overexpression on the expression of PBX3, TAL-1, and MEIS2 was analyzed by western blotting ( ***P Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) recruits DNMT3A to enhanced circKCNQ5 methylation Studies suggest that EZH2 is capable of recruiting DNMTs to the promoter regions of target genes, leading to reduced transcriptional activity [ 28 29 6 6 7  Fig. 6 The effect of EZH2 on circKCNQ5 methylation and proliferation in DR882MUT KG-1a HL-60 cells. A B C D  Fig. 7 E2H2 knockdown significantly reduced circKCNQ5 methylation and promoted circKCNQ5 expression in wild-type DNMT3A-overexpressed DR882MUT KG-1a cells, as well as the proliferation of these cells. A B C E Discussion DNA methylation is associated with the occurrence of AML through the regulation of tumor suppressor genes [ 30 31 32 33 8  Fig. 8 DR882MUT recruited E2H2 to inhibit circKCNQ5 methylation, and promoted circKCNQ5 expression. circKCNQ5 protein overexpression promoted the expression of PBX3, TAL-1, and MEIS2 in DR882MUT AML cells, as well as the growth of these cells In recent years, multiple studies have reported that numerous circRNAs are aberrantly expressed in AML and play dynamic roles in gene regulation [ 17 22 23 34 38 26 Notably, we found that DR882MUT decreases circRNA methylation, thereby regulating circRNA expression. EZH2 recruits WT-DNMT3A to enhanced circKCNQ5 methylation. EZH2 is a key member of the polycomb group (PcG) family of epigenetic regulators and serves as the catalytic subunit of PRC2. It plays a crucial role in epigenetic modifications [ 39 40 41 28 29 42 43 44 Nevertheless, there are still some deficiencies in our study. First, we did not verify the catalytic role of circKCNQ5 in DR882MUT AML through the regulation of downstream miRNAs and proteins. Next, we only investigated the effects of circKCNQ5 knockdown or DR882WT overexpression on the proliferation of DR882MUT cells. However, we did not examine the effects of circKCNQ5 knockdown or DR882WT overexpression on the proliferation of DR882WT cells. It remains unclear whether circKCNQ5 knockdown or DR882WT overexpression exerts regulatory effects in DR882WT-AML cells. The signaling pathway that circKCNQ5 may be involved in when regulating DR882 mutated AML progression needs to further explored. Conclusion Our results showed that circKCNQ5 was dramatically elevated in DR882MUT AML cells, and DR882MUT promoted AML progression by upregulating circKCNQ5 expression. EZH2 recruits WT-DNMT3A to enhance circKCNQ5 methylation and inhibit circKCNQ5 expression. circKCNQ5 may be a novel molecular therapeutic target for DR882MUT AML treatment.
