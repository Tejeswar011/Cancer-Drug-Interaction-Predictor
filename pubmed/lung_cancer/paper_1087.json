Summary  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of both primary melanoma and breast cancer co‐segregating with a CDKN2A Validating this genotype–phenotype correlation in additional pedigrees could significantly enhance clinicians' ability to assess risk and tailor personalized screening strategies to other high‐risk individuals. Breast cancer and primary melanoma are the second and third most common cancers in Australia, respectively, accounting for 28% and 11% of all cancer diagnoses each year (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2024 BRCA1 BRCA2 2017 CDKN2A 2011 BRCA1/BRCA2 2017 CDKN2A 2011 Approximately, 1%–3% of melanoma cases are classified as familial, and 20%–40% of those cases are attributed to a variant in a high‐risk melanoma gene ( CDKN2A, POT1, BAP1, POLE, CDK4, TERT, TERF2IP, ACD 2022 2015 CDKN2A 2025 2021 CDKN2A CDKN2A 2021 2021 2014 2000 CDKN2A CDKN2A 2004 Variants in moderate‐risk melanoma genes ( MITF, MC1R, GOLM1, ATM, EBF3, NEK11 2015 2020 2023 2024 MC1R 2012 CDKN2A 2001 This study reports segregation of a CDKN2A BRCA1 BRCA2 TP53 PTEN Whole exome sequencing and subsequent clinical panel testing were performed on a proband (II:1; Female) who had > 20 melanoma diagnoses (initial diagnosis in twenties) and breast cancer (diagnosis 50–60 years).

Furthermore, while no individuals had pathogenic variants in the four breast cancer predisposition genes tested, not all genes implicated in familial breast cancer were tested. It is possible that the increased incidence of breast cancer in this family is due to a variant in a different gene. Melanoma diagnoses were confirmed through pathology reports, where available. All breast cancers were self‐reported, but this has been associated with a high degree of accuracy (97%) in the literature (Abraham et al. 2009 CDKN2A 2011 This study reports CDKN2A CDKN2A MC1R CDKN2A 2016 CDKN2A Author Contributions Conceptualization: A.M.‐L., J.B., and H.P.S.
