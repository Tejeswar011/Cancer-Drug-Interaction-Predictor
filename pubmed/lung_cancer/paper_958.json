Introduction Lung cancer is the foremost cause of cancer‐related incidence and mortality [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Blood platelets, the second most abundant cells in peripheral blood originating from megakaryocytes, have been proposed as major modulators in tumorigenesis and progression [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 17 18 To address this issue, we conducted platelet RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) from healthy controls and lung cancer patients at early and advanced stages to excavate the genes that continuously changed with disease progression. Besides, the platelet RNA‐seq was analyzed by integrating with the RNA‐seq from tumor tissues to screen potential biomarkers for lung cancer. Overall, this study was aimed at exploring key platelet genes related to tumor progression and developing a platelet‐derived gene signature for predicting the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, which could aid in patient stratification and hold promise for personalized treatment approaches. 2. Methods 2.1. Blood Sample Collection Blood samples from 248 participators were collected for platelet RNA‐seq, including 102 patients with early and 65 patients with advanced lung cancer in The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen Medical College, as well as 81 healthy blood donors (Table 1 Table 1 The demographic data of the clinical samples.  Advanced ( n )  Early ( n )  Normal ( n )  p value Gender, n 0.176 Male 42 (64.6) 51 (50.0) 46 (56.8) Female 23 (35.4) 51 (50.0) 35 (43.2) Age, mean (SD) 61.14 (9.60) 61.83 (10.17) 59.75 (13.26) 0.452 Abbreviation: SD, standard deviation. 2.2. Blood Platelet Isolation For RNA‐seq, platelets were first collected by means of a magnetic separating method [ 19 g g −1 2.3. Blood Platelet RNA Isolation and Sequencing Total RNAs were extracted from the above purified platelets utilizing the Trizol method, followed by determination of RNA concentration and purity on a spectrophotometer. The platelet RNAs were amplified to generate the complementary DNA (cDNA), which was then utilized for library construction. Following purification, the library was sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California, United States) platform, with the PE150, 6G Raw Base sequencing strategy. 2.4. Publicly Available Datasets The RNA‐seq and clinical data for lung adenocarcinoma in TCGA database (TCGA‐LUAD) were acquired from the UCSC website. The TCGA‐LUAD cohort contained 583 samples (524 LUAD and 59 normal), which were utilized for prognostic analysis and other risk score–related analyses. Besides, two microarray datasets, GSE31210 GSE18842 GSE31210 GSE18842 2 Table 2 The detailed information for the used datasets in this study.

Screening of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) The DESeq2 package (Version 1.42.1) was employed to conduct differential analysis in early versus normal, advanced versus normal, and advanced versus early, followed by Benjamini & Hochberg corrections for multiple tests. Subsequently, DEGs were selected with the threshold of p 2 2.6. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) The WGCNA package (Version 1.72‐5) was run to identify disease progression–associated gene modules from platelet RNA‐seq data. Specifically, to establish a scale‐free network, a soft threshold power was first determined by calculating the square value of the correlation coefficient and average connectivity under each power. Afterwards, gene hierarchical clustering and dynamic tree cutting (minmoduleSize = 100) were conducted to identify highly correlated gene modules. Next, the relationships of each module eigengene with clinical phenotypes (normal, early, and advanced) were calculated to identify disease progression–associated module genes (correlation coefficient gradually increased or decreased with disease progression). 2.7. Screening of Disease Progression–Associated DEGs The overlapped genes between DEGs and the disease progression–associated module genes in WGCNA were screened by the ggvenn package (Version 0.1.10), which were considered as the disease progression–associated DEGs. The clusterProfiler package (Version 4.4.4) was employed to conduct enrichment analysis to discover the gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways for these overlapped genes. 2.8. Establishment and Assessment of Risk Prognostic Model The TCGA‐LUAD cohort was utilized for prognosis analysis. Briefly, with the aid of the caret package (Version 6.0‐94), the patients in this cohort were first assigned into training and test sets with an assignment ratio of 6:4.

Gene Mutations The cBioPortal database ( https://www.cbioportal.org/ https://guolab.wchscu.cn/GSCA/#/ 2.12. Drug Sensitivity To explore the linkage of risk score with drug sensitivity, we first quantified the IC50 value of each LUAD patient to common chemotherapeutics using oncoPredict package (Version 0.2). Next, correlation analysis was carried out to calculate the correlations of IC50 values with the risk score and the expression of each prognostic gene. 2.13. Statistical Analysis All analyses were conducted using R language (Version 4.2.3). Overall survival between groups was compared by log‐rank test. Correlation analysis was assessed by Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Comparison in terms of key gene expression, four kinds of scores calculated by ESTIMATE algorithm, and IC50 value of drugs between two groups was conducted using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. ∗ p ∗∗ p ∗∗∗ p ∗∗∗∗ p 3. Results 3.1. Screening of Genes That Dysregulated With Lung Cancer Progression Based on platelet RNA‐seq data, we performed differential analysis among normal, early, and advanced in these three groups. Compared to normal samples, there were 1721 DEGs, including 732 up‐ and 989 downregulated genes in early lung cancer (Figure 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f Figure 1 Differential expression analysis.

Risk score was calculated as follows: risk score = (0.22243) × expression of HPSE + (− 0.35265) × expression of DENND1C + (0.35536) × expression of GRWD1 + (− 0.06174) × expression of HLA − DQA1 + (0.13531) × expression of PDXK. In the TCGA‐training set, the risk model could assign patients with exact risk scores, thereby dividing those into high‐ and low‐risk groups based on the optimal cut‐off value of 0.11 calculated by the survminer package. The expression of PDXK, GRWD1, and HPSE gradually rose, while the other two gradually reduced along with the increase in risk score (Figure 4a 4b 4c 4 4 4 GSE31210 4g 4h 4i 4 Figure 4 Establishment and assessment of risk prognostic model.

Discussion Platelets have been proposed as major modulators in tumorigenesis, progression, and prognosis of a variety of malignancies, particularly lung cancer [ 23 24 WGCNA was employed to identify the genes associated with lung cancer progression [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 The prognostic value of these disease progression–associated DEGs was further explored, and five crucial genes, including HPSE, DENND1C, GRWD1, HLA‐DQA1, and PDXK, were determined. HPSE, also termed heparanase, is involved in modulating homeostasis of extracellular matrix [ 36 37 38 39 40 GSE18842 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 48 49 50 51 52 53 Based on these five prognostic genes, we established a risk model, which exhibited moderate power for risk stratification in lung cancer patients and was helpful for developing relative individualized treatment. Specifically, the obtained risk score for individuals exhibited close linkages with immune status, with a high‐risk score linked to a low infiltration level of most immune cells and high tumor purity in TME. These results implied that those with a high‐risk score were more likely to have an immunosuppressive TME and might not be candidates for immunotherapy. In addition, the obtained risk score for individuals also correlated with sensitivity to common chemotherapeutics. High‐risk patients had low IC50 to docetaxel [ 54 55 56 57 Nevertheless, several limitations should be admitted. Although the signature genes were platelet‐derived, their prognostic value was investigated based on tumor tissue data due to the lack of detailed clinical survival data of samples for platelet RNA‐seq. Differences between tumor tissue and platelet‐derived data may limit the clinical application of the model. Therefore, the performance of this platelet‐derived gene signature should be further investigated based on platelet‐RNA data and corresponding survival data. Besides, all findings from this study were obtained by computational analysis; the expression and role of signature genes in lung cancer progression were not investigated using functional experiments. In subsequent studies, the expression of the identified signature genes should be confirmed in platelet and tumor tissue based on a large scale of clinical samples. The exact roles of these genes in the progression of lung cancer should be investigated by a series of functional experiments both in vitro and in vivo. 5. Conclusion In summary, we identified a set of platelet‐derived genes that were persistently dysregulated along with lung cancer progression, and these genes were primarily involved in ribosome biogenesis–related functional pathways. Five platelet‐derived genes, HPSE, DENND1C, GRWD1, HLA‐DQA1, and PDXK, were identified as key prognostic markers, and the signature developed by these five genes could forecast the survival outcome and possible responses to immunotherapy or chemotherapy. These findings contribute to the development of personalized treatments and the improvement of patient outcomes in lung cancer.
