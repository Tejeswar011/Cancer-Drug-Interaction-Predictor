Background The association between late-life depressive symptoms and metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains a critical public health concern, yet most existing evidence relies on cross-sectional designs that fail to capture the dynamic nature of depression. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate how depressive symptom trajectories influence MetS risk in middle-aged and older adults, while examining potential effect modification by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Methods Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), we identified three trajectories of depressive symptoms (persistent low, moderate, and high) through group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) across four survey waves. Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations between trajectories and incident MetS, adjusted for age, sex, education, marital status, smoking, drinking, and income. Stratified analyses evaluated effect modification by these factors. Results Participants with persistent moderate (OR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.03–1.15) and high (OR=1.07, 1.01–1.14) trajectories had significantly higher MetS risk versus the low trajectory. Associations were strongest in adults <65 years, married individuals, and those with smoking/drinking habits (p <0.05), but did not vary by sex. Physical activity mediated 18.9% of the total effect (95% CI: 5–37%). Conclusion Dynamic depressive symptoms independently predict MetS risk, with amplified effects in younger, married, and health-risk subgroups. Targeted interventions addressing both depressive symptoms and modifiable behaviors (e.g., physical activity) may mitigate metabolic risk in aging populations. depressive symptoms metabolic syndrome trajectory ELSA older adults The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Depressive symptoms affect a significant proportion of elderly individuals worldwide, with reported prevalence rates varying from 4.5% to 37.4% in different populations ( 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 More and more evidence suggests that physical activity may be an important behavioral mechanism linking depressive symptoms to metabolic health. Depressive symptoms often lead to a decrease in physical activity levels ( 20 21 22 23 24 To our knowledge, no studies using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) database have investigated associations between trajectories of depressive symptoms and MetS. This study adopts a group-based trajectory model (GBTM) design, aiming to: (1) identify different longitudinal trajectory patterns of depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly populations; (2) analyze the association between these trajectories of depressive symptoms and newly diagnosed MetS; (3) explore the potential modifying effects of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors on this association; (4) evaluate the mediating role of physical activity in the relationship between depression trajectory and MetS. We hope to provide new epidemiological evidence for the relationship between the dynamic changes of depressive symptoms and metabolic health through longitudinal data from the ELSA database. Methods Data source and study population This study utilized data from the ELSA, a nationally representative, multidisciplinary cohort study of individuals aged 50 and older residing in England. Since its inception in 2002, ELSA has conducted biennial follow-up surveys, collecting comprehensive data on participants’ economic status, family circumstances, behavioral patterns, social participation, biological markers, retirement status, and health and well-being ( 25 Depressive symptoms and MetS An 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to evaluate depressive symptoms ( 26 27 In our analysis, depressive symptom trajectories derived from the 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 surveys served as the exposure variable, while incident MetS was the outcome variable. MetS was characterized by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria ( 28 Other covariates Several covariates were included in the analysis. Age and sex were recorded for all participants. The classification of educational attainment included below high school, high school, college or above. Participants’ smoking and drinking status was self-reported in response to the questions “Have you ever smoked cigarettes?” and “In the past 12 months, have you taken an alcoholic drink?”. Respondents were categorized as either never smokers or former/current smokers and as either never drinkers or current drinkers. Marital status was grouped into married/partnered, separated/divorced/widowed, or never married. Functional disability was assessed using validated measures of basic and instrumental activities of daily living. The Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale evaluated six fundamental self-care tasks: feeding, bathing, dressing, transferring (getting in/out of bed), walking across a room, and using the toilet. The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale assessed five more complex daily living skills: telephone use, financial management, medication administration, grocery shopping, and meal preparation. Participants reporting any degree of difficulty in performing one or more items on either scale were classified as having functional disability. Physical activity levels were assessed and categorized as vigorous (participants engaging in at least one session per week of high-intensity physical activity), moderate (at least one session per week of moderate-intensity activity), or light (less than moderate activity). Income refers to the total household income, including both spouses’ work income, investment income, and government welfare income such as pensions and annuities. Statistical analysis GBTM, a specialized form of finite mixture modeling, was employed to identify distinct subgroups of participants following similar developmental trajectories over time ( 29 29 30 Using the persistent low depressive symptom trajectory as reference, we conducted multinomial logistic regression analyses across three progressively adjusted models to examine associations between MetS and depressive symptom trajectories. Model 1: Unadjusted (trajectories of depressive symptoms only). Model 2: Adjusted for demographic confounders (age, sex, education, marital status).Model 3: Additionally adjusted for health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use), income level, and functional disability. The proportional hazards assumption for these logistic regression models was verified using Schoenfeld residuals. To manage missing covariate data, multiple imputation with chained equations was applied using the ‘mice’ package in R. We generated 10 imputed datasets with a maximum of 50 iterations per imputation, using a fixed random seed (123) for reproducibility. From these 10 imputed datasets, we selected the first complete dataset for our final analysis. This single imputed dataset was then merged with the original complete cases to form the analytical dataset used in all subsequent models. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), while categorical variables are shown as frequency (percentage). Baseline characteristics across depressive trajectory groups were compared using one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, or chi-square test as appropriate. R software (version 4.3.2) was used for all analyses, and statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05 (two-tailed). To investigate whether the association between trajectories of depressive symptoms and MetS varied by demographic characteristics, we conducted stratified analyses to assess potential effect modification by: (1) age (dichotomized at 65 years), (2) sex (male/female), (3) marital status, (4) educational attainment, (5) smoking status, and (6) alcohol consumption. These subgroup analyses were performed by introducing interaction terms between the trajectory groups and each demographic factor in separate multivariable logistic regression models, while maintaining adjustment for all other covariates in the base model. We conducted a sensitivity analysis restricting to participants aged ≥55 year to assess whether the depression-MetS association was robust to age cut-point selection. Mediation analysis followed Baron and Kenny’s approach ( 31 32 Ethical considerations ELSA adhered rigorously to the ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and obtained ethical approval from the London Multicenter Research Ethics Committee for all study waves, ensuring that written informed consent was secured from all participants.

Comparisons are made between “Persistent moderate vs. Persistent low” and “Persistent high vs. Persistent low.” Subgroups include age, sex, marital status, education, smoking, and drinking. Each subgroup has specific odds ratio values with confidence intervals and p-values. Notable findings include significant p-values for age ≥65, females, married individuals, those with college education or above, ever smokers, and ever drinkers, indicating statistical significance in these groups. Mediation analysis As shown in  Supplementary Table S1  Figure 3 Figure 3 Mediation effect. Flowchart depicting the relationship between physical activity, depressive symptomtrajectories, and MetS (Metabolic Syndrome). Arrows represent effects: physical activity to depressive symptom trajectories (0.828, 95% CI: 0.765, 0.898), physical activity to MetS (0.894, 95% CI: 0.832, 0.961), and depressive symptom trajectories directly affecting MetS (0.111, 95% CI: 0.013, 0.209). An indirect effect of physical activity through depressive symptom trajectories to MetS is also shown (0.021, 95% CI: 0.005, 0.037). Sensitivity analyses The sensitivity analysis is consistent with the main analysis results. When the age is set to ≥ 55 years, after adjusting for age, gender, marital status, education level, smoking and drinking behavior, and functional loss, individuals with persistent moderate depressive symptoms have a higher risk of developing MetS compared to individuals without depressive symptoms (  Supplementary Table S2  Supplementary Figure S1 Discussion This longitudinal study examined the association between depressive symptom trajectories and MetS in middle-aged and older adults. Through four survey waves, we identified three distinct depressive symptom trajectories (persistent low, moderate, and high), finding that individuals with moderate and high trajectories of depressive symptoms had significantly higher MetS risk compared to those with low trajectories. Subgroup analyses revealed these associations varied by age, marital status, and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol use) but not by gender. Our findings of three trajectories differ from another ELSA study ( 33 The observed association between depressive symptoms and incident MetS aligns with previous cross-sectional studies ( 34 35 36 37 38 39 The association between depressive symptoms and MetS involves complex pathophysiological mechanisms that have been elucidated through several lines of research. Individuals experiencing depressive symptoms often engage in unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor sleep quality, reduced physical activity, and a diet high in fats and carbohydrates. These behavioral risk factors can contribute to the deterioration of cardiovascular health and increase the risk of developing MetS ( 40 41 43 44 45 46 20 Our findings identify smoking and alcohol consumption as significant risk factors for MetS in depressed individuals, consistent with previous reports. Jinhee Lee’s study ( 47 48 49 50 51 Moreover, our results revealed that although women were more likely to exhibit a high depressive symptom trajectory, the associated risk of incident MetS did not significantly differ between genders within the same trajectory group. This suggests that the metabolic consequences of sustained depressive symptoms may be similar across genders, even if the underlying prevalence of depression differs. This result is consistent with several previous studies reporting a significant association between depression and MetS in both men and women ( 52 53 54 55 56 57 Furthermore, our analysis identified marital status as a significant effect modifier in the association between depressive symptom trajectories and MetS, with married individuals exhibiting a stronger association. This finding is supported by several previous studies conducted across diverse populations. For example, research by Ajlouni et al. ( 58 59 60 61 62 63 A key finding of our study is the mediating role of physical activity in the depression-MetS association. Depression frequently leads to reduced physical activity ( 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 65 To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the ELSA database to investigate the relationship between depression trajectories and MetS, and to discuss the mediating role of social activity. Our research has several limitations that need to be considered. Firstly, this study did not include information on the use of antidepressants. Antidepressant drug data was only available during the ELSA wave in 2004 and 2008, which hindered its consistent inclusion as a time-varying covariate throughout the entire modeling period (2002-2008).Due to the increased risk of developing MetS in individuals with the use of antidepressants ( 76 vs In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that trajectories of depressive symptoms in middle-aged and older English adults directly increase MetS risk while also exerting indirect effects through reduced physical activity. These results suggest that interventions targeting both depressive symptom management and lifestyle modifications, particularly physical activity promotion, may help mitigate MetS risk in this population.
