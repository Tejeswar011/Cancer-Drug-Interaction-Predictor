Nevertheless, their use may lead to significant cardiovascular immune-related adverse events (CV irAEs). Objectives We aimed to assess whether pre-treatment coronary artery calcium (CAC) deposition predicts CV irAEs in patients treated with ICIs. Methods A retrospective single-center cohort of patients treated with ICIs who performed pre-treatment chest computed tomography. A visual CAC assessment was categorized into Positive or Negative calcium deposits. Patients with pre-existing ischemic heart disease were excluded. The primary endpoint was the composite CV irAEs, including myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and arrhythmias, and the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Results The cohort included 240 patients with a median age of 67 (IQR 59–73) years and 47% female. The most prevalent type of cancer was lung cancer (36%), and the prominent ICIs was pembrolizumab (54%). Patients with Positive CAC (38%) were predominantly male, with higher rates of cardiovascular comorbidities. The primary outcome occurred in 36 cases (15%) at a median of 94 (IQR 48–338) days from the first ICIs dose. The Positive CAC group observed a non-significant trend toward a higher hazard for CV irAEs (HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.86–3.21, p p Conclusion Pre-treatment CAC deposition did not demonstrate an independent predictive role in assessing the risk of CV irAEs and all-cause mortality in patients treated with ICIs.

However, their use may be hampered by immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) from the pro-inflammatory T cell overreaction [ 1 2 3 4 5 Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring on computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a powerful predictor of CV events in the general population. Compared with patients with no coronary calcium, the adjusted risk of coronary events was increased by a factor of 7.73 to 9.12 [ 5 6 Since chest CT is routinely performed in most cancer patients as a baseline evaluation, we believe it may play a role in CV risk stratification. Therefore, our study aimed to assess whether pre-treatment CAC deposit may predict the development of CV irAE and all-cause mortality in patients treated with ICIs therapy. Methods Study population We conducted a retrospective, single-center, observational study at Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, a tertiary cancer center in Israel. Consecutive records of all patients treated with ICIs were reviewed between December 2015 and December 2021. The treating oncologist chose the specific therapy protocol according to current best practices. Our cohort included patients who performed pre-treatment chest CT before the initiation of ICIs therapy. Exclusion criteria included age under 18 years and a history of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The study was approved by the local Tel Aviv Sourasky Helsinki regulator ethics committee (Identifier: 0228-16-TLV). Physicians from the research team retrieved baseline characteristics from electronic medical records. Baseline comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, HF, atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and medical treatment (mainly cardio-protective medications, including renin-angiotensin receptor blocker (RAAS) inhibitors, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and statins). Malignancy diagnosis, as well as the specific ICIs treatment, were also extracted. Baseline high-sensitivity Troponin I (hs-TnI) values and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were collected. Computed tomography (CT) Non-gated chest CT was performed as a routine assessment before the initiation of ICIs therapy. The initial intention was to use automated Agatston scoring, but the images were suboptimal or inadequate for scoring. Thus, visual coronary and aortic calcification were performed through visual analysis by cardiologists (M.S.), blinded to the clinical outcomes. The categorization of the CAC was classified as None (0), Mild (1) = < 1/3 the length of the entire artery, Moderate (2) = 1/3–2/3 the length of the entire artery, and Severe (3) = > 2/3 the length of the entire artery, based on similar scoring used in recent studies [ 6 Study endpoints The primary endpoint was the composite CV irAEs, including myocarditis, a new HF diagnosis or an exacerbation, ACS, and arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation/flutter and ventricular tachyarrhythmia), consistent with previously reported CV complications associated with ICIs [ 7 1 Statistical analysis Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. The distribution of continuous variables was assessed using histograms and Q–Q plots, with all continuous variables showing a non-normal distribution. Continuous variables were described using median and interquartile range (IQR). The association between baseline characteristics and outcomes was assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported. Kaplan-Meier curves were created to evaluate the association of coronary and aortic calcium with the primary and secondary outcomes. A two-tailed p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 27.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results Two hundred and forty patients were included in our cohort.

While a Positive CAC deposit was frequent, it was not found to be an independent predictor for clinical outcomes. The incidence and spectrum of ICIs-induced cardiotoxicity are increasing, significantly impacting the management of ICIs therapy and patient prognosis [ 8 9 10 5 6 Schiffer et al. [ 6 5 Previous studies have highlighted the potential for ICIs to exacerbate CV risks through mechanisms involving immune-mediated inflammation and accelerated atherosclerosis [ 11 Study limitations Our study has several limitations. First, it is a single-center study, and thus, the generalization of our results is limited. However, since Tel Aviv Sourasky is a tertiary referral cancer center in Israel, the study population includes a variety of ethnic origins from all over the country and, therefore, represents a wide range of populations in Israel. Second, this is a retrospective study, and thus, our results are subject to the effects of potential confounders inherent to the nature of such studies and may be biased by their design. Third, the CT scans were not performed according to the CAC protocol, and in some studies, they included intravenous contrast, which may have affected the reading and results. Conclusions Baseline-positive CAC deposits did not predict CV irAEs or all-cause mortality in patients treated with ICIs therapy. These findings underscore the complexity of managing CV risks in cancer patients treated with ICIs. While CAC scoring remains a valuable tool for assessing atherosclerotic burden in the general population, its utility in predicting ICIs-related CV events warrants further investigation. Future prospective studies with larger and more contemporary cohorts of patients, including those treated with novel and combination therapies, are needed to elucidate the interplay between ICIs, CAC deposits, and CV events. This is particularly relevant given the increasing use of ICIs, advancements in CT technology, and the growing utilization of Cardiac CT.
