Stress granules that form during chemotherapy can promote cancer cell survival and chemoresistance by an unknown mechanism. Cells can also spontaneously trigger the ISR at low levels, which promotes cellular quiescence where cells exit the cell cycle and are resistant to therapeutic agents. We hypothesized that the ability of cells to form stress granules might be a critical signal to drive cells into quiescence. Herein, we provide several observations that suggest stress granules enhance cell survival and chemoresistance by promoting cellular quiescence. The mechanism by which stress granules promote quiescence is by stimulating p21 expression, leading to inhibition of Rb phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that stress granule formation is sufficient to trigger cellular quiescence and argue that inhibitors of stress granules may be effective in combination with chemotherapy to limit the development of chemoresistance in treating human tumors. stress granules cell cycle quiescence G3BP p21 vinorelbine pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes INTRODUCTION Stress granules are cytosolic condensates that form under various cellular stress conditions, including oxidative stress, heat shock, osmotic stress, and chemotherapeutics ( Anderson et al. 2015 Protter and Parker 2016 Jain et al. 2016 Khong et al. 2017 Khong and Parker 2018 Markmiller et al. 2018 Namkoong et al. 2018 Youn et al. 2018 Numerous studies indicate a close link between stress granules and cancer biology ( Anderson et al. 2015 Song and Grabocka 2020 Lavalée et al. 2021 Somasekharan et al. 2015 Grabocka and Bar-Sagi 2016 Valentin-Vega et al. 2016 Attwood et al. 2020 Song and Grabocka 2020 Somasekharan et al. 2015 Grabocka and Bar-Sagi 2016 Aucagne et al. 2017 Zhao et al. 2021 Fournier et al. 2010 Kaehler et al. 2014 Adjibade et al. 2015 Grabocka and Bar-Sagi 2016 Szaflarski et al. 2016 Bittencourt et al. 2019 Lin et al. 2019 Zhao et al. 2021 Anderson et al. 2015 Song and Grabocka 2020 Lavalée et al. 2021 Several models have been proposed to explain how stress granules could contribute to cell survival during stress. One common theme in many of these models is the sequestration of proapoptotic proteins to stress granules leading to the dampening of apoptotic signaling pathways. This includes the proapoptotic proteins RACK1 ( Arimoto et al. 2008 Kim et al. 2005 Tsai and Wei 2010 Zhao et al. 2021 Zhao et al. 2021 Thedieck et al. 2013 Wippich et al. 2013 Takahashi et al. 2013 Amen and Kaganovich 2021 In this manuscript, we demonstrate that stress granules promote cell survival and chemoresistance by promoting cellular quiescence. Cellular quiescence is a state of reversible cell-cycle arrest with reduced transcription and translation from which cells can reenter the proliferative state. Cellular quiescence is thought to promote cell survival by reducing reactive oxygen species due to increased glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation, upregulating antioxidant genes, increasing autophagic flux, and downregulating apoptosis genes ( Coller et al. 2006 Marescal and Cheeseman 2020 In Min and Spencer (2019) RESULTS Cells exhibiting spontaneous stress granules are often non-cycling If stress granules promote cells entering quiescence, stress granule formation should be observed in cells that spontaneously enter a quiescent state. To identify potentially quiescent cells, we used an antibody that recognizes Rb phosphorylation. Rb is hypophosphorylated in nonproliferating cells and becomes hyperphosphorylated upon cell-cycle commitment ( Weinberg 1995 G3BP1/2 GFP-G3BP1 Fig. 1 FIGURE 1.

To test this prediction, we subjected wild-type, G3BP1/2 GFP-G3BP1 + G3BP1/2 A striking result was that wild-type U-2 OS cells and GFP-G3BP1 + G3BP1/2 G3BP1/2 Fig. 6 Supplemental Fig. 5F Expression of stress granule proteins is correlated with higher p21 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma To determine if the role of stress granules in promoting quiescence was relevant to tumor progression, we examined how the expression of key stress granule components correlated with p21 Tang et al. 2022 Grabocka and Bar-Sagi 2016 Fonteneau et al. 2022 Redding et al. 2025 G3BP1 Fig. 6 G3BP2 Supplemental Fig. 6A CAPRIN1 Supplemental Fig. 6B p21 Fig. 6 G3BP1 p21 Fig. 6 G3BP2 p21 Supplemental Fig. 6C CAPRIN1 p21 Supplemental Fig. 6D p21 DISCUSSION We provide several observations demonstrating stress granule formation promotes entry into quiescence, which may contribute to chemoresistance. First, cells with spontaneous stress granules are often quiescent ( Fig. 1 G3BP1/2 Figs. 2 Supplemental Figs. 1A–E 5A,B M GFP-synthetic G3BP1/2 Figs. 3 Supplemental Figs. 2A–C 3A–E Fig. 6 Supplemental Fig. 5F Fig. 6 Supplemental Fig. 6A–D Three types of observations suggest that the formation of cellular quiescence by stress granules may have broad significance. First, cellular quiescence promotes resistance to many chemotherapeutic agents ( Naumov et al. 2003 Dembinski and Krauss 2009 Chen et al. 2012 Brown et al. 2017 Min and Spencer 2019 Fournier et al. 2010 Kaehler et al. 2014 Adjibade et al. 2015 Grabocka and Bar-Sagi 2016 Szaflarski et al. 2016 Bittencourt et al. 2019 Lin et al. 2019 Zhao et al. 2021 Kim et al. 2005 Arimoto et al. 2008 Thedieck et al. 2013 Takahashi et al. 2013 Amen and Kaganovich 2021 Somasekharan et al. 2015 Coller et al. 2006 Goddard et al. 2018 Marescal and Cheeseman 2020 Besides promoting chemoresistance, the ability of stress granules to induce cellular quiescence may enhance metastasis. Dormant cancer cells can metastasize to distant areas, remain quiescent for up to 20 years, and reenter the cell cycle ( Goddard et al. 2018 G3BP1/2 Somasekharan et al. 2015 D'Alterio et al. 2020 One major unresolved question is how p21 expression is regulated by stress granules. Gareau et al. (2011) p21 p21 Gareau et al. 2011 Fig. 5 p21 p21 p21 Arimoto et al. 2008 Tsai and Wei 2010 Thedieck et al. 2013 Wippich et al. 2013 Recognizing the importance of cellular quiescence in tumors, new therapies are being developed to “lock out” cancer cells from cellular quiescence, which renders the tumors susceptible to chemotherapeutics and also limits metastasis ( Recasens and Munoz 2019 Limitations of the study We acknowledge several limitations in this study. First, our analysis was restricted to a single cancer cell line, U-2 OS, making it uncertain whether the findings can be generalized across other cancer models. Second, we assessed cell-cycle exit using only two markers, p-Rb and p21, which may not fully represent the complexity of this process. Additional cell-cycle markers such as Ki67 and EdU would provide further support of the major findings in this manuscript. Third, it is possible that stress granules may extend the duration spent in quiescence, which we did not examine (rather than promoting exit from cell cycle); while our p21 data support a role in quiescence entry, we cannot exclude the possibility that stress granules contribute to both initiation and maintenance of the quiescent state.

The 4×SDS sample loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; NP0007) was added to lysates to a final concentration of 1×; samples were boiled for 5 min at 95°C, then loaded into 4%–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific; NP0322BOX), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat-dried milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and then incubated with 1:1000 primary mouse anti-G3BP1 antibody in 5% nonfat-dried milk TBST (Abcam; ab56574) for 1 h followed by 3× TBST washes and incubation with 1:1000 in 5% nonfat-dried milk TBST peroxidase (HRP) anti-mouse IgG horse secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; 7076S). Blots were stripped using Thermo Scientific Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 46430) by incubating for 15 min at room temperature. For loading control, membranes were incubated at room temperature for 30 or 60 min with the 1:1000 HRP conjugated anti-GAPDH in 5% nonfat-dried milk TBST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-47724). After 3× final TBST washes, antibody detection was achieved by applying Pierce ECL western blotting substrate for 5 min on the membranes and imaged on iBright 1500 (Invitrogen; A44114).

they impact this branch of the field? Our key finding is that stress granules promote cellular quiescence. This is exciting because it suggests that stress granules may have adaptive roles beyond their previously described functions—such as inhibiting apoptosis and inflammasome activation by sequestering apoptotic proteins, or acting as “plugs” to facilitate lysosomal repair, etc. Regulating the cell cycle is critical for allowing cells to pause, repair damage, and safeguard genomic integrity. This paper lays the groundwork for future studies to uncover how stress granules drive cell-cycle exit and the consequences of this regulation. In particular, it raises important questions about whether stress granule–mediated quiescence enables cancer cells or tumors to adapt to cancer-associated stresses—areas that my lab is actively investigating.  What led you to study RNA or this aspect of RNA science? RNA has fascinated me throughout my PhD and postdoctoral training, during which I explored RNA virus–host interactions, IRES elements, stress granules, and mRNP organization. My interest began as an undergraduate when I took a course taught by Professor Christopher Proud at the University of British Columbia. I was captivated by his lectures on RNA biology, particularly how cells rapidly modulate gene expression in response to stress through pathways such as the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTOR signaling. This early curiosity led me to pursue my PhD with Professor Eric Jan, where I studied how viruses circumvent cellular stress response pathways to translate their RNA genomes. Before selecting a postdoctoral lab, I attended a seminar by Professor Roy Parker at RiboWest (Edmonton, 2015), where he presented his lab's groundbreaking work on isolating and characterizing the stress granule proteome ( Jain et al. 2016  If you were able to give one piece of advice to your younger self, what would that be? I would tell my younger self to focus on the things I can control—intellectual growth and skill development. Science is inherently challenging, and experimental success often involves an element of “luck.” It becomes even more difficult if I don't fully understand the scope of the research question (or equally exciting alternative questions that could be explored), the pitfalls of the hypothesis, the limitations of the approaches, how to interpret data, and how to communicate findings effectively. It's easy to feel discouraged when a hypothesis fails or when experiments hit roadblocks, but by prioritizing intellectual growth and building strong skills, I create more opportunities to be “lucky” by quickly refining or shifting hypotheses, generating quality data, and asking better questions. I emphasize this mindset to my team as well. Students can feel demotivated when experiments fail, but instead of measuring themselves by experimental outcomes, it's healthier and more productive to evaluate their progress through their intellectual growth and skill development.  Are there specific individuals or groups who have influenced your philosophy or approach to science? Many individuals during my PhD and postdoctoral training have contributed to my growth as a scientist, but my postdoctoral mentor, Roy Parker, was particularly instrumental in shaping my scientific approach. Roy often emphasized the importance of intellectual growth and effective communication for the following reasons. First, it is critical to know your field deeply to identify exciting and impactful research questions. Second, having a broad scientific perspective allows one to connect ideas across disciplines and adopt new approaches. Third, effective communication is not just about “selling” one's work or building collaborations—it reflects clarity of thought, which is essential for intellectual development. These lessons have profoundly influenced my philosophy. I make it a habit to present and write frequently as a means of sharpening my thinking, and I encourage my team to do the same as part of their professional growth.  What are your subsequent near- or long-term career plans? My long-term career goal is to uncover fundamental RNA processes involved in cellular stress responses, particularly those triggered by the tumor microenvironment (e.g., chemotherapeutics, hypoxia, and nutrient starvation). This includes studying translation control, RNA stability, stress granules, and P-bodies under various stress conditions and cancer-related mutations, with the aim of identifying new therapeutic modalities that exploit cancer vulnerabilities during stress. Over the past two years as a principal investigator, I have also come to deeply value mentoring the next generation of RNA and cancer scientists. Watching students grow intellectually, develop new skills, communicate effectively, and build confidence has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my new role. My goal is not only to advance RNA science but also to foster an environment where students can learn, grow, and succeed. ",
