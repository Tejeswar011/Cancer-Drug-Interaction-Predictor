Liquid biopsy technology offers new opportunities for precise diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer; however, its clinical application still presents challenges. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the research progress and future trends of liquid biopsy technology through a bibliometric analysis. Methods Literature on liquid biopsy technology in lung cancer research spanning from 1990 to 2024 was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. Various bibliometric tools were employed, including VOSviewer (1.6.20), Cite Space (6.2.R3), RStudio (utilizing the R package bibliometrix), and Scimago Graphica, to explore the current situation and research hotspots in this area. The research covered multiple aspects, including publication counts, contributions from different countries and institutions, journals involved, authorship, co-references, and keywords. By generating corresponding visualization maps, an attempt was made to forecast future development trends within this research field. Results We identified 363 articles published in 198 journals, authored by 2518 authors from 266 institutions across 54 countries/regions. The journal, country, institution, and author with the highest number of publications were Cancer, China, Harvard University, and ROLFO C. Over the past 34 years, research on the application of liquid biopsy technology in lung cancer have primarily focused on cancer diagnosis, biomarkers, and treatment monitoring. Conclusion Liquid biopsy technology is rapidly evolving in the field of lung cancer. Detecting biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and extracellular vesicles, facilitates early detection and monitoring of treatment response, reveals drug resistance mechanisms, and promotes personalized treatment. With the advancement of technology and international cooperation, liquid biopsy is expected to provide more accurate diagnosis and treatment for patients with lung cancer in the future.

Patients are often asymptomatic in the early stages, but as the disease progresses, patients may develop persistent symptoms, such as chronic cough, chest pain, and dyspnea. 1 2 3 4–6 7 8 Liquid biopsy technology, an emerging non-invasive diagnostic tool, enables early diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and prognostic evaluation of tumors by analyzing biomarkers in the blood, such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and exosomes. 9–15 12 13 16–20 Bibliometrics is a method of revealing scientific development trends and research hotspots through quantitative analysis of literature data. 21 Materials and Methods Data Sources and Literature Retrieval All bibliographic data were obtained from the WoSCC database. The search period spanned January 1, 1990, to September 30, 2024. The retrieval strategy combined subject terms for lung cancer and liquid biopsy techniques, using this search formula: (TS=“Lung Neoplastics” OR “Neoplastics, Pulmonary” OR “Neoplastic, Pulmonary” OR “Pulmonary Neoplastics” OR “Neoplastics, Lung” OR “Lung Neoplastics” OR “Neoplastic, Lung” OR “Lung Cancer” OR “Cancer, Lung” OR “Lung Cancer” OR “Cancer of Lung” OR “Pulmonary Cancer” OR “Cancer, Pulmonary” OR “Cancer, Pulmonary” OR “Cancer, Pulmonary” OR “Cancer, Pulmonary” OR “Cancer, Pulmonary Cancer” or “Cancer of the Lung”) and TS= (liquid biopsy techniques). Eligibility Criteria and Data Standardization We included original research articles and review papers that focused on the application of liquid biopsy technology in lung cancer, were written in English, and provided complete bibliographic metadata (title, authors, affiliations, country, keywords, and source, amongst others). We excluded non-research documents, such as conference abstracts, patents, news items, and popular health articles, as well as duplicate records identified during screening. The retrieved records were exported in RefWorks and plain-text formats and subjected to a standardized preprocessing workflow comprising removal of special characters and formatting artifacts, harmonization of synonymous terms and abbreviations (standardizing variants such as “NSCLC” and “non-small cell lung cancer”), and conversion to analytics-ready formats using the Data Import/Export function in CiteSpace. Data Analysis We conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis using Microsoft Excel, VOSviewer (v1.6.20), CiteSpace (v6.2.R3), RStudio (with the bibliometrix package), and Scimago Graphica across a 34-year period from January 1990 to September 2024, with 1-year time slices. We used Excel to quantify annual publication volumes, track country-level outputs over time, and classify records by research category. RStudio/bibliometrix was used to generate visual mappings of journal sources, national contributions, international collaboration, co-cited references, keyword frequencies, and author activity. CiteSpace was used to examine institutional collaboration networks and centrality as well as to detect keyword clusters and burst terms. Node types included keyword and institution co-occurrence, and pruning was kept at default settings. VOSviewer was used to support the analyses of co-cited references, while Scimago Graphica was used to refine author and keyword frequency visualizations. Co-occurrence, clustering, and burst analyses were integrated to produce optimized knowledge maps for visualization-driven interpretation. The overall retrieval and analysis workflow is summarized in Figure 1 Figure 1 Flowchart illustrating the screening process for literature selection.

( A B C D Discussion Global Publication Trends Consistent with our bibliometric findings of a sharp rise in annual publications, research on liquid biopsy in lung cancer has shown an accelerating trajectory over the past three decades, particularly after 2015. This growth mirrors advances in NGS, 16 23 37 38 28 11 International and Institutional Collaboration Our collaboration analysis revealed substantial regional imbalances. China produced the largest volume of publications, reflecting its expanding investment in translational oncology research. However, the CPP for China was lower than those of Western countries, implying that the overall scientific influence of Chinese studies is still developing. In contrast, the United States, with fewer publications, exhibited a higher impact and broader international collaboration, as evidenced by elevated MCP ratios. Institutions such as Harvard University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai occupied central network positions, bridging different regions and forming high-density collaborative clusters. These findings underscore that productivity alone does not guarantee influence; rather, international cooperation and network centrality are critical for amplifying global visibility. For countries with high output but limited impact, strengthening cross-regional partnerships and enhancing methodological rigor are necessary to achieve greater international influence. Biomarkers and Clinical Applications The bibliometric mapping of keywords, co-cited references, and citation bursts highlights biomarkers as the cornerstone of liquid biopsy research in lung cancer. ctDNA 2 9 12 16 30 39 40 9–11 19 29 41 16 37 38 42 13 18 37 43–46 47 12 37 41 48 Research Hotspots and Emerging Directions The evolution of thematic clusters suggests a transition from technical innovation to clinical translation. In the early phase, research prioritized optimization of detection platforms, including digital PCR 13 49 16 35 12 35 17 44 17 25 50 Challenges and Future Prospects The clinical promise of liquid biopsy is widely recognized; however, several critical challenges remain unresolved. Technical heterogeneity—encompassing pre-analytical variability, inconsistencies in detection sensitivity, and the absence of universally accepted standardized assays—continues to impede its widespread clinical implementation. Moreover, current research has predominantly concentrated on advanced-stage lung cancer, 51 52 Looking ahead, three research priorities can be distilled from our findings. First, the development of internationally recognized standards for liquid biopsy assays is imperative to ensure methodological consistency and reproducibility across studies and clinical settings. Second, research efforts should be broadened to encompass early diagnosis, longitudinal disease surveillance, and MRD assessment, thereby extending the clinical utility of liquid biopsy beyond advanced-stage management. Third, integrating liquid biopsy with multi-omics platforms, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, will facilitate the construction of comprehensive biomarker landscapes that more accurately capture tumor heterogeneity. These directions are essential for addressing current limitations and for establishing liquid biopsy as a robust clinical tool that effectively bridges experimental discovery with bedside application, ultimately accelerating the implementation of precision medicine in lung cancer. Limitations This study has some limitations. First, the analysis was conducted exclusively using data from the WoSCC, which may have resulted in the omission of pertinent studies indexed in other databases, such as PubMed or Embase. Incorporating multiple databases in future research would improve the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the findings. Second, in the study, we primarily relied on quantitative bibliometric indicators, which are valuable for identifying trends and patterns, but may not fully capture the scientific rigor, methodological quality, or clinical relevance of individual publications. Third, the exclusion of non-English literature may have introduced potential language bias, which could limit the global applicability of the results. Finally, although visualization tools enhance the clarity of bibliometric outputs, interpreting clustering results and temporal trends inevitably involves a degree of subjectivity and may not completely reflect the most recent or ongoing developments in this rapidly evolving field. Conclusion We applied bibliometric and visualization tools to systematically map the research landscape, thematic hotspots, and developmental trajectories of liquid biopsy in lung cancer over the past 34 years. This field remains in a dynamic growth phase, with Cancers and Clinical Cancer Research emerging as leading journals in publication output and citation influence, respectively. Current research primarily focuses on cancer diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and treatment monitoring. Liquid biopsy through the detection of ctDNA, CTCs, and extracellular vesicles offers distinct advantages for early detection, real-time therapeutic assessment, elucidation of drug resistance, and personalized treatment. Despite ongoing technical and standardization challenges, rapid methodological advances and expanding global collaborations highlight its substantial potential to reshape clinical practice. Continued multidisciplinary and translational efforts are expected to accelerate the routine integration of this approach, ultimately improving the outcomes of patients with lung cancer.
