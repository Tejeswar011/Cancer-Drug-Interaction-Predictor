Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) impairs intestinal function through oxidative stress. The transsulfuration pathway is essential for sulfur amino acid metabolism and antioxidant defense through glutathione biosynthesis. This study investigated how AKI caused intestinal injury and the mechanisms involved. AKI was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats through kidney ischemia (45 min)-reperfusion (24 h). AKI decreased intestinal glutathione (antioxidant) levels and compromised intestinal barrier function. Glutathione biosynthesis in mammals requires cysteine made through the reverse transsulfuration pathway, catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). AKI decreased the expression of these enzymes in intestinal epithelium. AKI also altered gut microbiota composition and the expression of bacterial enzymes in the forward transsulfuration pathway, which could disrupt intestinal antioxidant defense. The inhibition of this pathway in gut epithelial cells reduced glutathione levels and tight junction protein expression. These results suggest that the disruption of the transsulfuration pathway impairs antioxidant defense, leading to intestinal barrier damage and dysbiosis in AKI.

Gastrointestinal complications can exacerbate AKI by promoting systemic inflammation, increasing oxidative stress, and disrupting the gut microbiota, which can further impair renal function and complicate the overall recovery process. 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 Both host cells and gut bacteria are capable of synthesizing glutathione. 41 de novo Figure S1 42 , 43 20 , 32 19 , 44 32 , 33 Cysteine is a crucial amino acid for protein synthesis (nutrient role) and energy generation (energy role) in bacteria. 45 46 patB malY Figure S1 31 , 34 22 25 34 34 Escherichia-Shigella Parasutterella Alloprevotella Bacteroides Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group Prevotellaceae Escherichia-Shigella 47 Parasutterella 48 Alloprevotella 49 , 50 Bacteroides Bacteroides fragilis, 51 Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group Prevotellaceae 52 , 53 Glutathione is a potent endogenous antioxidant that plays an important role in maintaining intestinal redox balance and protecting cellular integrity. 54 55 18 , 20 , 31 56 , 57 Limitations of the study While this study provides novel insights into the role of the transsulfuration pathway in AKI-induced intestinal oxidative stress, a few aspects warrant further investigation. Despite the significant reduction in glutathione levels in the intestinal epithelium, the expression of key glutathione synthesizing enzymes remained unchanged. This observation suggests that glutathione depletion may be primarily due to reduced cysteine availability stemming from suppressed transsulfuration pathway activity. However, the synthesis of glutathione also depends on the activity of glutathione synthesizing enzymes. Glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis, is known to be regulated through various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, S-glutathionylation, and nitration, which can alter its catalytic activity in response to oxidative stress. 18 , 58 Conclusions AKI can impair intestinal function through increased oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate that the downregulation of the transsulfuration pathway is associated with low glutathione levels in the intestinal epithelium and in the digesta. This, in turn, may weaken the antioxidant defense capacity, contributing to oxidative stress in the intestine. AKI-induced changes in microbiota may further deplete glutathione and exacerbate intestinal damage. Glutathione and sulfur-containing amino acids, synthesized in the host and bacteria, work together to maintain a redox balance within the gut. The interaction between the host and microbiota is essential for the maintenance of gut health and barrier function. The disruption of redox balance leads to oxidative stress and dysbiosis, which may contribute to AKI-induced distant organ injury. The restoration of antioxidant defense may protect intestinal barrier integrity and improve AKI-induced distant organ injury.

This human colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived cell line is male in origin and widely used to model intestinal epithelial cells. 66 2 Method details Ischemia-reperfusion model A total of 12 rats were randomly assigned to either the kidney ischemia-reperfusion (IR) group or sham-surgery group (n = 6 per group), with randomization stratified by body weight. All animals were fed a rodent chow (Prolab® IsoPro® RMH 3000, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) and all surgical procedures were performed between 8:00-12:00 AM to minimize circadian influence. Kidney ischemia was induced by applying a non-traumatic vascular clamp to the renal pedicle, blocking blood flow to the left kidney for 45 minutes. This was followed by reperfusion and removal of the right kidney. 67 68 69 70 Biochemical analysis Kidney function was evaluated by measuring plasma creatinine using the Cobas c111 analyzer (Roche, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The analyzer automatically mixed plasma samples with alkaline picrate reagent, and creatinine concentration was determined based on the resulting colorimetric reaction. Calibration was performed with Roche Calibrator for Automated Systems and internal quality control was ensured using Roche PreciControl ClinChem Multi 1 and 2. Plasma endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides) was measured using Chromogenic Endotoxin Quant Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Plasma samples were diluted and heat-treated to inactivate proteases, then incubated with Limulus Amebocyte Lysate and a chromogenic substrate. Endotoxin concentrations were determined based on colorimetric detection. Intestinal malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured using thiobarbituric acid assay following a modified Ohkawa method. 71 Glutathione levels were quantified by spectrophotometry using a 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB)-based recycling assay. 72 Cysteine quantification Cysteine content in intestinal tissue and colonic digesta was measured using an amino acid analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The freeze-dried and finely ground samples were treated with 2-octanol and oxidized with freshly prepared performic acid. The mixture was incubated at 0°C for 16 h to convert cysteine to cysteic acid. 73 Hematoxylin and eosin staining The intestine (jejunum) was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, transferred to 70% ethanol, and processed for routine paraffin embedding. The embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm using a rotary microtome and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through graded ethanol (100%, 95%, 70%), and rinsed in distilled water. H&E staining was performed by immersing slides in Harris hematoxylin, followed by differentiation in 1% acid alcohol and bluing in 0.2% ammonia water. Sections were counterstained with eosin Y, dehydrated, and cleared in xylene. Tissue morphology was visualized using an Olympus BX43 upright light microscope equipped with an Olympus Q-Color3 digital camera (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Villus height and crypt depth were measured from 25 well-oriented villi per sample using Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). Gut microbiota analysis Colon digesta DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands), including a blank extraction control to monitor kit contamination. DNA concentration and purity were measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Barcoded primers targeting the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene were used to PCR amplify the extracted bacterial DNA using the Earth Microbiome Project standard protocol. 74 75 59 61 62 63 , 65 Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis To perform quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, total RNA was prepared from small intestine (jejunum) and Caco-2 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) followed by chloroform, isopropyl alcohol, and 75% ethanol. RNA concentrations and purity were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

Western immunoblotting analysis Protein was prepared from intestinal tissue and Caco-2 cells using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Equal amounts of protein (40-80 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 6%-10% gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized using an ECL substrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and imaged with a ChemiDoc™ Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). β-Actin was used as a loading control. SP1 DNA-binding activity The DNA-binding activity of SP1 in jejunal nuclear extracts was assessed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear proteins were extracted following a modified protocol based on hypotonic lysis and differential centrifugation . 2 Quantification and statistical analysis Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using the R program (version 4.3.2). The distribution of each dataset was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess normality, and Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances. The differences in gut microbiota patterns were evaluated by permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the vegan package in the R program. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was performed. The two-group comparison was analyzed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, Welch’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test. For multiple-group comparison, the Kruskal-Wallis test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Welch’s ANOVA were performed, followed by post-hoc analysis using Dunn’s, Tukey’s test or Dunnett’s T3. The results were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). P References 1 Chawla L.S. Bellomo R. Bihorac A. Goldstein S.L. Siew E.D. Bagshaw S.M. Bittleman D. Cruz D. Endre Z. Fitzgerald R.L.
