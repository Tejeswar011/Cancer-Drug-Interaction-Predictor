However, the role of VRK family genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires further research. Moreover, the clinical potential of the VRK-related model remains unclear. The aim of this study is to construct a VRK-related model to predict HCC prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. Methods The data of HCC patients were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was used to calculate the VRK score of each sample. Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER 2.0) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) were used to evaluate immune cell infiltration and the immune checkpoint response. pRRophetic was used for predicting drug sensitivity. CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, transwell and xenograft assays were used to experimentally validate the biofunction of VRK2 in HCC. Results We found that all VRK family genes were highly expressed in HCC. Compared with patients with low VRK scores, patients with high VRK1 or VRK2 expression in the TCGA, ICGC, and GSE14520 GSE14520 in vitro in vivo Conclusion The VRK score was found to be a reliable indicator for predicting HCC prognosis and therapeutic efficacy. VRK2 is a potential therapeutic target for HCC. VRK immune therapy bioinformatics HCC The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

This family of genes exhibits serine/threonine protein kinase activity ( 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 In vitro 17 18 In this study, we systematic investigated the expression and prognosis of VRK family genes in HCC and different subgroups. Next, we established a novel prognostic signature (the VRK score) independent of subjective selection bias using the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm. Importantly, we verified the robustness of our prognostic signature in three independent HCC cohorts. Furthermore, our prognostic signature successfully predicted the efficacy of drug treatment in HCC patients. Moreover, we experimentally verified that VRK2 knockdown inhibited HCC proliferation in vitro in vivo 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data collection and processing For the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data (TCGA-LIHC), mRNA expression transcriptome profiles (transcripts per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads format, TPM) and corresponding clinical information were obtained using the ‘TCGAbiolinks’ package (version 2.28.4) ( 19 https://dcc.icgc.org/ GSE14520 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ 2.2 VRK score construction and independent prognostic analysis The single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was used with the ‘GSVA’ package (version 2.0.6) to calculate the VRK score of each HCC sample. The optimum cutoff values were selected with the ‘survival’ package (version 3.8.3). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 27). Nomograms and calibration curves were produced with the ‘rms’ package (version 7.0). 2.3 Immune and tumor microenvironment analysis Immune cell infiltration analysis based on the 6 algorithms (XCELL, TIMER, MCPCOUNTER, QUANTISEQ, EPIC, and CIBERSORT) was performed using the TIMER2.0 database ( http://timer.comp-genomics.org/ 20 http://tide.dfci.harvard.edu/ 2.4 Gene mutation analysis and drug sensitivity prediction Gene mutation analysis and tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis of the TCGA cohort were performed with the ‘maftools’ package (version 2.22.0). Drug sensitivity prediction was subsequently performed with the ‘pRRophetic’ package (version 0.5). 2.5 Cell culture and transfection MHCC97H cells were obtained from the National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures. The cells were cultured in DEME (HyClone, China) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution (Solarbio, China) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 5 5  Supplementary Table S1 2.6 Cell proliferation and half-maximal inhibitory concentration assays For the CCK-8 assays, cells (2000/well) were seeded into a 96-well plate. Next, a CCK-8 kit (ZP328-1, Beijing Zoman Biotechnology, China) was used to detect the absorbance of the samples at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Briefly, 10 μl of CCK-8 solution was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 hours. Then, the absorbance values were detected at 450 nm. For the half-maximal inhibitory concentration assays, cells (5000/well) were seeded into a 96-well plate and treated with indicated concentrations of cisplatin for 24 hours. Then, 100 μl fresh complete medium containing 10 μl CCK-8 solution was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 hours. Subsequently, the absorbance values were detected at 450 nm. For the colony formation assays, the cells (500/well) were seeded into a 6-well plate and cultured for 14 days. Next, 4% paraformaldehyde solution was used to fix the cells for 20 minutes at room temperature, followed by staining for 20 minutes at room temperature with 0.1% crystal violet solution. The number of cells was determined with ImageJ software (version 1.53). Cisplatin (M2223) was purchased from AbMole. 2.7 Cell metastasis assays For the wound healing assays, the cells were seeded into a 6-well plate. When cell fusion reached 95%, a wound was generated by scraping the middle of the plate with a 200 μl sterile pipette tip, after which the medium was replaced with serum-free medium. After 48 and 72 hours, the migration distance was measured with ImageJ software (version 1.53). For transwell assays, 24-well transwell chambers with 8 μm pores and Matrigel (354480, Corning, USA) were used. Briefly, cells (1x10 4 2.8 Gene set enrichment analysis GSEA was performed by the GSEA soft (version 4.3.2). The hallmark gene sets were obtained from the molecular signatures database ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp 2.9 Animal model Five-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were purchased from GemPharmatech and housed in a specific pathogen-free environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle and controlled temperature and humidity, and food and water were provided ad libitum. MHCC97H cells (2x10 6 2 2.10 Immunohistochemistry Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections were deparaffinized, repaired with 0.01 M citric acid buffer at 95°C for 20 minutes and incubated overnight at 4°C with a Ki-67 antibody (1:10000, 27309-1-AP, Proteintech, China). Then, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody (PV-6000, ZSGB-BIO, China) for 1 hour at room temperature after being washed with TBS three times. The IHC results were quantified with ImageJ software (version 1.53). 2.11 Western blotting Protein lysates were prepared by RIPA buffer (P0013B, Beyotime, China) and run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis (ZD304A-2, Zoman, China). Separated proteins were then transferred to the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (ISEQ00005, Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated with the primary antibody in the blocking buffer (overnight at 4°C) followed by horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Proteintech) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were developed by performing the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents on the membranes and the signals were detected by the ECL blotting analysis system (4AW011-100, 4abio, China). Beta-actin in Western blotting was used as the endogenous loading control. Anti-VRK2 antibody (1:1000; Proteintech; 12946-1-AP), anti-AKT1 antibody (1:1000; HUABIO; ET1609-47), anti-pAKT1 antibody (1:1000; HUABIO; ET1607-73), anti-RPS6 antibody (1:1000; Proteintech; 80208-1-RR), anti-pRPS6 antibody (1:1000; Proteintech; 29223-1-AP), anti-beta-actin antibody (1:1000; HUABIO; M1210-2), goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000; ZSGB-BIO; ZB-2301) and goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10000; ZSGB-BIO; ZB-2305)were used. 2.12 Statistical analysis All data are presented as the means ± standard deviations (SDs). The comparison of quantitative data between the two groups was performed using Student’s t test (normal distribution) or the Mann–Whitney test (nonnormal distribution). The comparison of quantitative data among three or more groups was performed using one-way or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Count data were compared using the chi-square test. Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman correlation analysis. The prognostic analysis based on Kaplan–Meier survival curves was completed using the log-rank test. All statistical analyses were completed with R (version 4.4.2), SPSS (version 27), and GraphPad Prism (version 10.2.3) software. The ‘ggplot2’ package (version 3.5.1) and GraphPad Prism (version 10.2.3) were used to create plots.

It features TCGA, ICGC, and GEO sources, leading to expression and prognostic analysis, establishment of VRKs score, followed by various analyses and prediction, and concluding with in vitro and in vivo validation of VRK2 in HCC. Next, we comprehensively explored the expression of VRK family genes in HCC. All three independent HCC cohorts (TCGA, ICGC, and GSE14520  Figure 2A GSE14520  Figure 2B  Supplementary Figures S2A, B 21  Figure 2C  Figure 2D  Figure 3E  Supplementary Figures S2C–E Figure 2 Differential mRNA and protein expression of VRK family genes.

Panels A to D show Kaplan-Meier survival curves comparing high versus low VRK expression across different datasets (TCGA, ICGC, GSE14520 3.2 Establishment and independent prognostic analysis of the VRK score Considering the high expression of VKR family genes in HCC, we next explored the effect of VRK family genes on the outcomes of HCC patients. First, we used the ‘survival’ package to automatically obtain the optimal cutoff values for VRK1, VRK2, and VRK3. Next, HCC patients were divided into high- and low-expression groups based on the cutoff values of the three genes. HCC patients with high VRK1 or VRK2 expression had poorer overall survival than patients with low VRK1 or VRK2 expression in all three independent HCC cohorts (  Figures 3A, B  Figure 3C Therefore, we aimed to construct a novel prognostic signature to evaluate HCC prognosis based on the VRK family gene expressions. Given the inconsistent prognostic results of VRK3 expression in the three cohorts, we used VRK1 and VRK2 for construction of the signature. With the ssGSEA algorithm, we calculated the VRK score of each HCC patient in the three cohorts and divided the patients into high- or low-VRK score groups using the ‘survival’ package. As expected, patients with high VRK scores had poorer overall survival than patients with low VRK scores did in all cohorts (  Figure 3D  Figure 3E  Figure 3F GSE14520  Supplementary Figures S3A–D  Supplementary Figure S3E 3.3 TME and immune checkpoint blockade response analysis of the VRK score Increasing evidence has shown that immune activity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) strongly affects HCC prognosis and treatment ( 22 23  Figure 4A  Figure 4B GSE14520 GSE14520  Supplementary Figures S4A–D Figure 4 Immune microenvironment and immune checkpoint response analysis of the VRK score.

Each panel uses different datasets like TCGA, ICGC, and GSE14520 Considering the disparities in immune infiltration and function associated with high and low VRK scores, we then used TIDE analysis to predict the response to immune checkpoint blockade (such as anti-PD-1 therapy) in the VRK score subgroups. The ratios of response in the low-VRK-score group were greater than the ratios of response in the high-VRK-score group in the three HCC cohorts (  Figure 4C  Figures 4D–F  Supplementary Figures S5A–C 3.4 Mutation, TMB, and drug susceptibility analysis of VRK scores In addition to the tumor immune microenvironment, genetic mutations in tumors also affect HCC prognosis and treatment ( 24  Figure 5A 25  Figure 5B  Figure 5C Figure 5 Mutation and drug sensitivity of the VRK score.

Panel D is a scatter plot illustrating the inverse relationship between VRKs score and sorafenib sensitivity in the TCGA dataset. Panels E feature scatter plots indicating negative correlations between VRKs score and sensitivity to gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and cisplatin, with statistical significance noted. Next, we assessed the sensitivity of other systemic therapy drugs beyond immune checkpoint inhibitors among the VRK score subgroups. Interestingly, patients with a low VRK score were more likely to be sensitive to sorafenib, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and cisplatin (  Figures 5D, E GSE14520  Supplementary Figures S6A–C 3.5 VRK2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis in HCC As VRK2 was highly expressed in tumor tissues in all three HCC cohorts in this study, we further investigated the functional role of VRK2 in HCC. The western blot results revealed that the siRNA successfully knocked down VRK2 protein expression (  Supplementary Figure S7A  Figures 6A–C  Figures 6D, E  Supplementary Figure S7B  Supplementary Figures S7C, D  Supplementary Figure S7E  Supplementary Figures S7F, G in vitro Figure 6 VRK2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation in vitro (A, B) (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) P P P Graphs and images depict the effects of siNC, siVRK2-1, and siVRK2-2 on MHCC97H and HCCLM3 cell lines.

For example, in breast cancer, stemness-related lncRNA signatures and disulfidptosis-related risk scores based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm are used to predict patient outcomes, stemness, and immunotherapy response ( 29 30 31 32 7 33 34 35 36 7 35 35 37 VRK family genes encode VRK1, VRK2, and VRK3 proteins with serine/threonine protein kinase activity ( 10 38 39 19 39 in vitro in vivo GSE14520 To date, an increasing number of prognostic models and molecular subtypes have been developed for evaluating HCC prognosis and treatment efficacy ( 9 23 However, there are several limitations in our study. First, our study was based on information from previous HCC cohorts, and no prospective study has been conducted to further validate our findings. Second, our study did not further investigate the molecular mechanisms of VRK family genes in the setting of HCC. In our study, a novel model was constructed to evaluate the outcomes of HCC patients and the therapeutic efficacy of HCC treatments, which we hope will provide a basis for the precise treatment of HCC.
