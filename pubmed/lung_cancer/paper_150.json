In this white paper by the Basic and Translational Research Group of the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society, we discuss the qualities and drawbacks of current disease models and propose good practices for integrating state‐of‐the‐art technologies including bulk and single‐cell genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics in contemporary NEN research. We also provide insights on how to properly handle tissue samples (particularly when starting material is limited) and discuss technical hints of relevance when planning liquid biopsy or tumor immunology studies. Future translational studies of NENs will benefit from centralized biologic material biobanking, research design planning in the context of multi‐expertise committees, as well as experimental protocol optimization and sharing across the NEN scientific community. carcinoids genomics liquid biopsy models transcriptomics pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Cros J Casanovas O Castaño JP White paper on best practices for translational research in neuroendocrine neoplasms J Neuroendocrinol 2025 37 10 e70072 10.1111/jne.70072 PMC12488366 40717619 1 INTRODUCTION Basic and translational investigations are key drivers of advances in oncology. The better understanding of tumor progression and mechanisms of resistance, the discovery of new therapeutic targets and biomarkers are only a few examples. Biological resources are the cornerstone of these studies, and in rare neoplasms such as neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) they must be particularly looked after and carefully used. Their quality and the one of tumor models will determine the relevance of the findings and how fast they can be applied to improve clinical care. It is therefore of the utmost importance to have common standardized operating procedures so that resources can be shared or pooled. Similarly, clinical trials in NENs are extremely precious due to the quality of the data that they provide, but they are often lengthy due to the rarity of the disease. Ancillary studies and sampling performed during the trials must be very carefully planned to ensure that they are compatible with current and future state‐of‐the‐art technologies to answer the many questions open in NENs. In this white paper, we will present the most common study models available in thoracic and digestive NENs, their qualities and drawbacks, and propose good practices for tissue sample handling, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomics analyses, as well as circulating and immune biomarkers evaluation. 2 ETHICAL AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS TO SHARE SAMPLES AND DATA IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH Ethical regulations for sample sharing and analysis are a fast‐moving field with possibly differing inter‐country requirements. This aspect cannot be treated lightly as obtaining the proper documents from all the participating centers may take months, sometimes years. Not completing (or starting) such procedures may impact the perceived feasibility of a project when being reviewed for a grant application. The specifics include multiple types of documents, from informed consents from patients to legal approval from germane ethical committees, which commonly differ substantially depending on the country, and will not be discussed here. In a multicenter international study using samples, one might consider performing the research in parallel in each center if the technologies can be similar (like federated learning is performed for artificial intelligence). If this is not possible, in addition to the local ethical permit, the researchers will have to obtain the approval for sharing and shipping samples and for the recipient to import them. Another important aspect to consider is the potential intellectual property that the project may generate or that has already generated in one of the centers. Consortium agreements may take months to years to be signed. 3  NEN 3.1 In vitro/ex vivo models One of the major limitations in the study of NENs is the lack of relevant in vitro models.  1  1  1 1  2  3  2  4 TABLE 1 An overview of 3D models for cancer biology studies. 3D model Definition Spheroids This term is often used to refer to organized aggregates of cells derived from 2D cell lines, grown using a variety of 3D‐cell culture techniques. Patient‐derived tumoroids Organized aggregates of a heterogeneous population of cells derived from patient tumor tissue. As cells are not generally sorted, the aggregates contain both tumor cells and some stromal cell populations. The media used for tumoroids often contains FBS and other growth factors. Tumoroids cannot be expanded indefinitely and are suitable for short‐term experiments only. Patient‐derived tumor organoids Self‐organizing aggregates of patient‐derived tumor cells that can be expanded in vitro indefinitely. Organoid culture involves growth of cells embedded in a basement membrane gel and a defining feature of this culture system is the use of serum‐free media that is designed to promote the growth of tumor cells. While patient‐derived tumor organoids often contain some stromal cell populations at early passages (P0–P3), later passages contain tumor cells exclusively. When designing the experimental procedure, it is important to consider that each model has some limitations and to choose wisely the most appropriate model according to the scientific question (Table 2 1 TABLE 2 NET preclinical models: pros, cons, and preferential applications. Model Pros Cons Preferential applications Cell lines Easy to handle and to manipulate Mainly high grade Mechanistic studies PDTs  High efficiency Recapitulate molecular features of patients  Cannot be genetically modified Lack of TME Short‐term use Drug screening PDTOs  Recapitulate molecular features of patient Can be genetically manipulated  Mainly high grade Low efficiency and time‐consuming Lack of TME  Drug screening Mechanistic studies Mouse models Full TME  Mainly insulinoma Rarely metastases  Studies on angiogenesis Interactions with TME Tumor progression Xenotransplant (Mouse) Include part of the TME  Low efficiency in mice Lack of immune system  Drug screening Tumor‐stroma interactions Xenotransplant (Zebrafish)  Include part of the TME High efficiency  Short‐term use Difference between human and fish biology  Drug screening Cell migration Abbreviations: NET, neuroendocrine tumor; PDTs, patient‐derived tumoroids; PDTOs, patient‐derived tumor organoids; TME, tumor microenvironment. FIGURE 1 Neuroendocrine neoplasms models and samples for translational studies. Fresh and cryopreserved human tumor samples can be used for generating cell lines, patient‐derived tumor organoids/patient‐derived tumoroids as well as precision‐cut slices. Tumor tissue can also be injected in immunocompromised animal models for generating patient‐derived xenografts. Multiple layers of ‐omic analyses can be performed using formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded (FFPE) and frozen tissue. Circulating tumor RNA/DNA, extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor cells as well as circulating immune cells can be isolated and analyzed from blood samples. Genetically engineered animal models can be used to validate biological hypotheses or test the efficacy of therapeutic agents. 3.1.1 Cell lines A few cell lines derived from pancreatic NEN (PanNEN), small intestine neuroendocrine tumor (SI‐NET) and pulmonary NET are currently available (Table 3  5  6  7  8  9  9 TABLE 3 An overview of available NEN cell lines.

Several SI‐NET cell lines have been reported to date (KRJ‐I, CNDT2.5, GOT1, P‐STS, L‐STS, H‐STS). Unfortunately, one cell line (P‐STS) no longer expresses NET markers, while three other SI‐NET cell lines (KRJ‐I, L‐STS, H‐STS) were found to be derived from transformed lymphoblasts rather than NETs.  10  12  13  14 Seven pulmonary NET cell lines have been established (NCI‐H727, NCI‐H720, NCI‐H835, UMC‐11, TC1, TC2, TC3). TC1, TC2, and TC3 were derived from typical carcinoids.  15 www.atcc.org/ KRAS TP53 RB1 TP53 RB1 TP53 3.1.2 Patient‐derived tumoroids and PDTOs The culture of patient‐derived NEN tumoroids has been successfully established. After isolation from the tissue, the cells are cultured in 3D. PanNET tumoroids retain neuroendocrine cell differentiation, proliferation rates resembling the tissue of origin, and maintain treatment response similar to the originating tumor.  16  17  18 Patient‐derived tumoroids can be derived either from fresh tumor or cryopreserved tissues. For cryopreservation, tumor tissues can be cut into small pieces (5 mm 3  16 PDTOs have been established for high‐grade NENs originating from a variety of organs, including lung, stomach, liver, duodenum, colon, and pancreas.  19  20  21  22  23  24  20  24 PDTOs have also been successfully established for low‐grade pulmonary NETs and for a supra‐carcinoid.  4 3.1.3 Precision cut tumor slices An alternative for short term culture is precision cut tumor slice (PCTS).  24  24 3.2 Animal models of NENs Animal models of NENs have been developed in various species of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, including mice, zebrafish, fruit fly, and dogs. Each of these models has advantages and limitations, and the choice of model depends on the specific research questions being addressed. The development of accurate and relevant animal models is crucial for advancing our understanding of NENs and developing effective treatments. 3.2.1 Genetically engineered mouse models Mice can be genetically modified to develop NENs by introducing specific mutations that trigger the development of the tumor. A complete list of currently available models can be found in.  25  26  27  28 3.2.2 Xenograft models Human NEN cells and cell lines can be injected into immunocompromised mice to form xenograft tumors.  29  30  31  32 3.2.3 Zebrafish models Zebrafish models have emerged as a valuable tool for studying NETs. The transparency of zebrafish embryos allows for easy visualization of tumor growth and progression. Fish embryos injected with human NET cell lines have been used to investigate angiogenesis.  33  34  35  36 3.2.4 Fruit fly models  Drosophila melanogaster  37  38  39  40 4  NEN Human‐derived tissues and their byproducts are of the utmost importance for NEN research. Standardized sampling protocols and integrative pre‐planned studies are key to sample preservation, allowing its use in multiple studies leading to large “molecularly annotated” cohorts. 4.1 Standard operating procedures for sampling Cold ischemia, namely the time between the removal of the tumor and its processing, is the main cause of tissue/cell degradation leading to organoid culture failure, poor nucleic acid quality, and altered morphology and immunoreactivity. It is therefore important to collect this information so it may be used for sample selection when performing experiments or to interpret discordant data. NENs display an extensive intratumor heterogeneity both at the level of tumor cells and probably in the stromal and immune microenvironment, although this has been less studied. Sampling done on fresh tumors by the pathologist is performed “blindly.” For NENs that are usually well delimited, the sampling is made in the tumor in most cases, but the frozen area might be of a lower grade than the final grade assessed on the complete specimen, hence leading to possible discrepancies when combining molecular and clinicopathological data. It is therefore of the utmost importance to record where the sampling was performed (i.e., which area was used to produce organoids, to make the frozen sampling, etc.). An easy way if multiple samples are taken from the same tumor is to ink each “hole” with a specific color (Figure 2 2 FIGURE 2 Efficient tissue sampling for research purposes. The left panel shows a distal pancreatectomy that was cut fresh to perform normal (yellow circle) and tumor (red and green circles) tissue sampling that were flash frozen prior to formalin fixation. Areas used for frozen sampling were inked with different colors on the surgical specimen so they can be distinguished, especially when multiple tumor areas are taken. After fixation, slices are placed on a board and photographed. Samples taken are recorded on the photography, and their spatial distribution (white numbers indicating the FFPE block number) is noted. The right panel shows an efficient design of a translational study in which multiple centers merge their cohorts to address different scientific questions. This leads to a well annotated cohort with extensive molecular characterization that can be further enriched by outside teams for additional ‐omic studies. NEN intratumor heterogeneity and plasticity is poorly understood. NENs can be quite large (primary localization) or have multiple localizations (metastases). It is therefore important that the sampling after formalin fixation for paraffin embedment is extensive to best encompass all the possible tumor components. Taking one sample per cm of the tumor's greater axis is the minimum. Similarly, in the case of multiple metastases, taking at least one sample per lesion >2 cm will ensure correct tumor characterization. Similarly, Ki‐67 assessment on multiple blocks (especially if several morphologies coexist) is recommended to obtain the most accurate tumor grading. For studies devoted to tumor heterogeneity or radio‐pathological correlation studies, a standardized protocol recording the localization of the sampling after formalin fixation will be important. An efficient method is to cut the specimens similarly to CT‐scan images for Whipple resection and perpendicularly to the main duct for left pancreatectomy and to photograph all slices, allowing recording of where all the samples were taken (Figure 2 4.2 Integrative studies for precious samples Samples such as biopsies or samples derived from a clinical trial are precious. Every time the sample is reused to perform additional studies, a part of it is lost during the process of block adjustment in order to cut the tissue slices that will be deposited on the glass slides to perform immunohistochemistry (IHC), to extract nucleic acids, and so forth. It is therefore tissue‐efficient to plan all the studies in advance through a scientific committee with a molecular pathologist (for samples derived from a clinical trial for instance). This will allow to collect all the requests, prioritize them, and best organize the sample processing in order to minimize tissue loss (example: prepare tissue microarray [TMA] first, so the cores are as long as possible, perform a dual RNA/DNA extraction to limit the number of cut slices, cut slides for IHC by batch in accordance with the project, with 1–2 additional slides in case of IHC failure). Having multiple teams working on the same cohort with different interests also allows to obtain a cohort with multiple levels of molecular annotations that can be further queried by other teams to quickly test a hypothesis. This “mille feuille” approach, while requiring an agreement between the partners for authorship and intellectual property, is the most efficient in the long run (Figure 2 4.3 Tissue microarrays Whole slide‐based studies are very informative on tumor heterogeneity but can be very time‐consuming or expensive if a large cohort is to be studied. TMAs allow to study multiple tumor fragments on a single slide. Briefly, cores ranging from 600 μm to 2 mm in diameter are taken from the tumors of interest after careful selection by a pathologist. Ideally, at least four cores in different areas are taken per tumor to better model the heterogeneity. Since within the same tumor several blocks may be better preserved than others (exposure to formalin, embedment artifacts), it is recommended that the four cores are taken from at least two blocks if possible. Multiple cores are then placed into an acceptor block that can be cut like any formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded (FFPE) block. 5 CIRCULATING BIOMARKERS Liquid biopsies enable minimally invasive detection of tumors, identification of their molecular characteristics as well as patient follow‐up over time and are therefore an attractive alternative for tissue samples. The most investigated source for liquid biopsy is blood, but other biological fluids including urine and saliva can be used as well. These have the advantage of being completely noninvasive and might even be located closer to the primary tumor but contain bacteria, which can potentially dilute the human signal or accelerate its degradation.  41 5.1 Circulating cell‐free nucleic acids In the acellular fraction of blood obtained after centrifugation, circulating cell‐free nucleic acids including circulating cell‐free DNA (ccfDNA) and RNA (ccfRNA) can be recovered. One of the main challenges for ccfDNA is to avoid contamination with genomic DNA as this dilutes the fraction of ccfDNA and consequently circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). For this reason, (i) it is recommended to use blood collection tubes with a stabilizing reagent (e.g., Qiagen PAXgene, Streck DNA BCT, Cell‐Free DNA Collection tubes Roche, etc.) and (ii) plasma is preferred over serum.  41  42 g g  43  44  45  41  46 5.2 Circulating tumor cells Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), also known as “the liquid phase of tumor progression,” can be recovered in the cellular fraction of the blood.  46  41  47  48  41  42 5.3 Extracellular vesicles Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells throughout the body as part of intercellular communication. Among EVs, exosomes carry specific cargoes such as RNA, miRNAs, proteins, etc. The exosomal RNA is much more stable than the ccfRNA since it is not affected by enzyme activity.  41  41 6 TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY Understanding the intricate interactions between the immune system and NEN cells is of utmost importance for advancing NEN research and paving the way to innovative treatment options for NEN patients. The reliability and validity of tumor immunology studies in NET patients hinge on meticulous sample collection and standardized processing protocols. 6.1 Circulating immune cells Establishing standardized procedures when collecting circulating immune cells is paramount to minimize variability and ensure results reproducibility. First, the choice of the appropriate anticoagulants, such as EDTA, is key to prevent coagulation and preserve the integrity of immune cell populations. Second, acknowledging the influence of circadian rhythms on immune cell composition and activity underscores the importance of consistent timing in sample collection.  49  50 A variety of technologies to phenotypically and functionally characterize immune cells are currently available. While flow cytometry, multiparameter flow cytometry, fluorescence‐activated cell sorting and mass cytometry are used to phenotypically profile (and possibly isolate) distinct immune cell types, cytokine production assays, tumor cell killing assays, and immune cell proliferation assays are routinely used to evaluate the functional activity of immune cells. A summary of commonly employed markers for immune cell typing and cell differentiation evaluation is provided in Tables 4 5 TABLE 4 Common markers for immune cell phenotyping.

T cell receptor sequencing can be performed using either DNA or RNA as starting material; the use of RNA allows to better capture the actual TCR expression profile.  51  52  53  54  55 6.2 Tissue‐resident immune cells FFPE, frozen, or fresh tumor samples can all be analyzed to study immune cell infiltration in NENs. IHC, immunofluorescence, and TMAs are routinely employed to assess the presence and type of immune cells in NENs. RNAseq data can be deconvoluted to depict the immune cell composition of the tumor microenvironment.  56  57 3 7 GENOMIC STUDIES 7.1  DNA Five aspects are key for the success of DNA sequencing: (a) high quality and quantity of starting material; (b) choice of the most suitable technology for library preparation; (c) choice of next‐generation sequencing (NGS) platform; (d) choice of the right analysis panel; (e) costs and benefits evaluation. For the first issue, standard operating procedures are required for the transport of samples to avoid errors and delays in tissue processing.  58  59 2  60  61 NGS library preparation systems can induce discrepancies in test reading.  62  63 There are two main types of NGS platforms: Illumina and Ion Torrent systems.  59  64  65 The choice of an appropriate gene panel is crucial for the downstream analyses. While small NGS panels containing 5–50 genes may identify a limited number of disease‐relevant mutations, their analysis may be performed quickly and at low cost.  66  67  68  69  70 7.2  DNA Epigenetic includes modifications of DNA that affect gene expression and chromatin organization without altering the DNA sequence. The main epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation, which is the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine, typically in CpG islands, and modification of histone tails. DNA methylation changes during cell development and differentiation. Each cell type has a specific DNA methylation profile. For this reason, DNA methylation profiles are extremely powerful in identifying the cell of origin as well as stratifying tumor subtypes.  71  71  72  73 8 TRANSCRIPTOMIC STUDIES 8.1 Bulk RNAseq Bulk RNAseq is usually fast and cost effective, but averages the expression levels of a given gene in all the cells present in a sample. Removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which typically constitutes more than 90% of the total RNA in a cell, and consequent enrichment in messenger RNA (mRNA) may be achieved through poly(A) selection or rRNA depletion. Typically, poly(A) selection requires high‐quality, minimally degraded mRNA.  74  75  76  77 RNA sequencing can involve single‐end (SE) or paired‐end (PE) reads, where the latter is preferable for de novo transcript discovery or isoform expression analysis  78  79  80  79  81  75 RNAseq is subjected to a significant batch effect that can potentially create discrepancies in the bioinformatic analysis. It is therefore recommended to perform RNAseq for the same cohort at the same time and on the same machine. Grouping RNAseq experiments is also cost‐effective. Sequencing of noncoding RNAs should be carried out using specific approaches.  82 8.2 Single‐cell RNAseq Single‐cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) identifies the different cell types present in a cell suspension based on gene expression patterns. It can also be used to identify markers specific to each tumor subpopulation (tumor cells, immune cells, endothelial cells, etc.), or to measure differentially expressed genes between different subpopulations. Rare cell populations can be sorted prior to single‐cell analysis,  83  84 8.3 Spatial transcriptomics Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that combines high‐throughput profiling of gene expression with the spatial information of cells in tissues or organs. It enables the identification and mapping of gene expression patterns of individual cells in their native tissue context, offering a more complete understanding of the molecular and cellular organization of tissues. This technology involves positioning tumor tissue sections on slides containing spots with spatial barcode probes capable of capturing mRNA that will indicate their provenance after sequencing. These experiments take place on arrayed slides comprising around 5000 spots of 50–100 μm in diameter, thus providing a resolution of ~5–20 cells per spot. Resolution is posed to increase rapidly, possibly enabling us to map intracellular interactions in the near future. Any intact tissue containing viable mRNA is suitable for spatial transcriptomics. Among the most established technologies, 10× Visium has an extensive list of optimized tissues covered  85  86  87 + 9 PROTEOMIC STUDIES Proteomics encompasses the examination of the complete array of proteins expressed within a cell, tissue, or organism. It serves as a valuable complement to genomics and transcriptomics since the data derived from the latter offer only indirect assessments of cellular conditions, potentially failing to precisely mirror concurrent protein alterations.  88 9.1 Mass spectrometry Mass spectrometry (MS)‐based techniques have found extensive use in the identification and quantification of proteins. They are best suited to fresh or frozen samples, but protocols are now available for FFPE samples. Proteins are extracted and purified from tissue or cell lysates by centrifugation and filtration. Then, the protein mixture is typically separated by two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis to reduce sample complexity. Total proteins can be identified by MS analysis of their peptides, which are produced by enzymatic digestion, and the data are interpreted using a proteome database.  89  90 9.2 Protein pathway array The protein pathway array (PPA) serves as a high‐throughput method for investigating the regulation of protein–protein interactions, pathway–pathway interactions, and biological functions, aiding in determining the placement of newly identified proteins within cellular signaling networks.  91  92 9.3 Multiplex IHC Multiplex IHC capability has recently expanded. Either frozen tissue or FFPE specimens can be used as sample sources.  93 10 OMICS DATA INTEGRATION In the omics era, data integration between different technologies remains a hurdle due to the complexity of datasets and technologies used. Often, the analyzed samples are not extracted at the same time and from the same tumor area, thus potentially biasing the analyses. Multi‐Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) is a factor analysis model that provides a general framework for integrating multi‐omics datasets in an unsupervised manner. MOFA can be described as a generalization of principal component analysis to multi‐omics data. Given multiple data matrices containing measurements of multiple types of omics data on the same or overlapping sample sets, MOFA infers a low‐dimensional representation interpretable in terms of a few latent factors. These learned factors represent the main sources of variation between data modalities and facilitate the identification of cellular states or tumor subgroups. Such an approach has already been used to distinguish molecular subtypes of small bowel and lung NETs.  94  95 11 CONCLUSIONS Many fundamental questions about the pathobiology of NENs remain unanswered. While currently available research models are limited, novel technological developments are arising both in terms of new in vitro models as well as improved approaches to analyze tissues, especially FFPE tissues, forecasting a bright future for NEN research. In this context, translational studies on NENs will greatly benefit from (i) centralized biologic material biobanking (at institutional, national and international level), (ii) careful research design planification with multi‐expertise committees, (iii) knowledge sharing of the best approaches and caveats to address a specific question, (iv) protocol sharing across the NEN scientific community to make data comparable, (v) inter‐team mutualization of sequencing batches to reduce costs and improve data aggregation. Importantly, ENETS Centers of Excellence should actively promote translational research in NENs, fostering the scientific discoveries that will eventually lead to the cure of these malignancies.
