Background Patients with refractory mismatch repair-proficient/microsatellite stable (pMMR/MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer exhibit intrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors and conventional salvage therapies, with median overall survival (OS) is typically less than 10 months. This study evaluates the novel BRICS sequential regimen (Bifidobacterium supplementation, Radiotherapy, Immunotherapy, Chemotherapy, Stereotactic approach) in this population. Methods In this retrospective analysis, 27 refractory pMMR/MSS metastatic CRC patients received BRICS: Stereotactic body radiotherapy to a single lesion, indefinite high-dose probiotics, followed by low-dose chemotherapy plus PD-1 inhibitor. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and OS. Results Efficacy outcomes: ORR 33.3% (9 partial responses), DCR 88.9%, median PFS 7.20 months (95% CI: 5.23–9.18), and median OS 12.30 months (95% CI: 9.89–14.71). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) >2 independently predicted inferior OS (HR = 4.860; p=0.042), while metastatic burden (≥3 organs) predicted shorter PFS (HR = 3.179; p=0.026). Grade 3–4 adverse events occurred in 22.2% of patients (neutropenia: 14.8%; thrombocytopenia: 3.7%; anemia: 3.7%). Conclusions BRICS demonstrates clinically meaningful efficacy (DCR 88.9%, mOS 12.3 months) and manageable toxicity in refractory pMMR/MSS metastatic CRC. ECOG PS >2 and high metastatic burden identify patients with limited benefit, warranting prospective validation in biomarker-enriched cohorts. metastatic colorectal cancer mismatch repair-proficient BRICS regimen salvage therapy stereotactic body radiotherapy The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a potent immunomodulator, inducing immunogenic cell death and releasing tumor neoantigens that promote dendritic cell activation and T-cell priming ( 6 vs 7 8 9 10 11 12 Building upon these principles, our team pioneered the ​BRICS sequential therapeutic regimen-an acronym for ​Bifidobacterium supplementation, ​Radiotherapy, ​Immunotherapy (PD-1 inhibitors), ​Chemotherapy (low-dose), and ​Stereotactic approach. This strategy temporally coordinates SBRT-induced antigen release, microbiome modulation, and metronomic chemotherapy to sustain immune activation. In a recent retrospective study of PD-L1-negative, EGFR/ALK wild-type metastatic NSCLC (n=23), BRICS achieved unprecedented efficacy: objective response rate (ORR) 95.7%, median PFS 16.0 months (95% CI: 9.11–22.89), and median OS 32.7 months (95% CI: 11.53–53.87) with minimal toxicity ( 13 Given the mechanistic parallels between PD-L1-negative NSCLC and pMMR CRC-both characterized by T-cell exclusion and ICI resistance—we hypothesized that BRICS could address the critical unmet need in refractory pMMR/MSS metastatic CRC. This preliminary study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the BRICS regimen in this population, leveraging our established protocol to potentially redefine therapeutic paradigms for immunotherapy-resistant gastrointestinal malignancies. 2 Methods 2.1 Data source The data of patients diagnosed as pMMR advanced colorectal cancer patients at Cangshan Hospital Area, 900 Hospital of the Joint Logistics Support Force, and Quzhou People’s Hospital between January 2018 and December 2024 were retrieved from the electronic medical record system. Patients were deemed eligible for inclusion in this retrospective real-world study if they met the following criteria: (1) a definitive histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced colorectal cancer; (2) immunohistochemically confirmed pMMR status or NGS-confirmed MSS status.; (3) absence of treatable target mutations such as Her-2, B-raf, or KRAS wild type; (4) receipt of the ‘BRICS’ treatment strategy; (5) presence of at least one measurable lesion; and (6) patients who had disease progression or intolerability after receiving at least ​two prior lines​ of systemic therapy ​including oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil. In addition, the exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) a history of autoimmune disease; (2) a poor ECOG performance status of > 3. (3). without measurable lesions. The follow-up deadline was set for March 31 th 2.2 Treatment procedure The BRICS therapeutic regimen was follows: Eligible patients underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) targeting a single metastatic lesion (preferably ≤3 cm, anatomically well-circumscribed regions such as intrahepatic metastatic lesions) with 5–8 Gy delivered daily over three to five consecutive days (based on the size, and location of the tumor for radiation). SBRT technical specifications:​​ Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) was delivered using ​volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)​. The prescription dose ranged from ​25–40 Gy in 3–5 fractions, adjusted based on lesion location. The biologically effective dose (BED) was calculated with an ​α/β ratio of 10 Gy​ for tumor control. Organ-at-risk constraints adhered to AAPM TG-101 guidelines: ​Spinal cord: Cumulative dose limit of ​​<22 Gy to 0.35 cm³​. ​Liver: ​**>700 cc receiving <21.5 Gy**​. ​Lungs: ​**>1500 cc (male) or >950 cc (female) receiving <12.5 Gy**. Concurrently, oral triple-dose Bifidobacterium/Lactobacillus probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum​​ (Strain No.: S19980004) at a dose of ​2×10^8 CFU/day, administered ​until disease progression or intolerable toxicity) were initiated and continued indefinitely. After a 24-hour post-SBRT recovery period, patients received low-dose chemotherapy (such as low-dose FOLFOX regimen: oxaliplatin 100mg d1 iv + 5-fluorouracil 500mg iv once, 1.5g civ 48 hours + calcium folinate 500mg d1 iv/every 21 days) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor, repeated every 21 days for up to six cycles. Chemotherapy dose reductions were implemented for grade ≥3 hematologic toxicity, while immune-related adverse events were managed per ASCO guidelines. Following completion of six cycles, patients continued probiotic maintenance while undergoing quarterly surveillance with contrast-enhanced CT/MRI monitoring. In cases of disease progression, a new cycle of BRICS therapy was initiated by selecting one progressing lesion meeting the original SBRT criteria (≤3 cm, non-critical location) for re-irradiation. Post-SBRT, the patient received an additional up to six cycles of BRICS chemoimmunotherapy, followed by treatment discontinuation and surveillance. This iterative approach continued until systemic progression or intolerance, with cumulative radiation doses constrained to organ-at-risk tolerance limits (e.g., spinal cord cumulative Dmax <45 Gy). The protocol prioritized temporal coordination of SBRT-induced antigen release, microbiome modulation, and metronomic chemotherapy to sustain immune activation. The treatment protocol was presented in the  Figure 1 Figure 1 Treatment protocol of BRICS sequential therapeutic regimen. BRICS treatment strategy diagram detailing steps for cancer therapy: 1. Radiotherapy targets single lesions under three centimeters with low radiosensitivity. Dosage is five to eight Gy per session for three to five days, followed by a one-day break. 2. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy using low-dose chemotherapy with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. 3. Targeted therapy includes tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The central theme involves live combined Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus tablets. An illustration of intestines with a magnifying glass is included. 2.3 Data collection and outcomes evaluations Clinical response to the BRICS sequential therapeutic regimen was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The enrolled patients underwent imaging evaluation every 6–8 weeks during treatment, while every 12 weeks after treatment. The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a complete response (CR: complete remission of all target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% reduction in the sum of the diameters of target lesions). Progressive disease (PD) referred to a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. A disease that could not be classified as PR or PD was evaluated as stable disease (SD). The percentage of patients with CR, PR, or SD was defined as the disease control rate (DCR). PFS was calculated as the time from the initiation treatment of BRICS to PD or death. OS referred to the time from the initiation treatment of BRICS to death of the deadline of the follow-up. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0). 2.4 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics (percentages, means, and medians) were used to describe the baseline characteristics and clinical features of the patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Short-term efficacy was evaluated using ORR and DCR. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared via the log-rank test based on ECOG PS and metastatic organs. Multivariable Cox regression was considered but not performed due to the limited sample size. K-M curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). These analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). P ≤ 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. 3 Results 3.1 Patient characteristics and outcomes A total of 27 patients were enrolled in this study.

Notable HRs include metastatic organs (HR: 3.179, CI: 1.148-8.808) with significant p-value of 0.026. Other factors such as age, gender, and smoking show diverse HRs with non-significant p-values. Figure 4 Univariate analysis of prognostic factors for OS. Forest plot showing hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals for various variables related to survival outcomes. Variables include age, gender, smoking, number of metastatic organs, primary tumor site, third-line therapy, radiotherapy organ, and ECOG performance status. ECOG PS shows a significant p-value of 0.008, HR of 4.328. Other variables have non-significant p-values. 3.4 Subgroup analysis Univariate analysis indicated that the number of metastatic organs might be an independent predictor for progression-free survival (PFS). Consequently, survival outcomes were stratified by metastatic burden using a cutoff of 3 organs. A significant difference in PFS was observed between patients with <3 versus ≥3 metastatic organs (log-rank p=0.015), while no statistical difference was found in OS (p=0.383). This suggests that metastatic burden may serve as an independent prognostic factor for PFS in advanced CRC patients receiving salvage BRICS therapy (  Figure 5 Figure 5 Subgroup analysis of metastatic organs as prognostic factor for PFS (A) (B) Two Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown. Panel A compares progression-free survival probability between groups with less than three metastatic organs and those with three or more. Median progression-free survival with confidence intervals is listed along with a P-value of 0.015. Panel B compares overall survival probability using similar groupings and includes a P-value of 0.383. Censored data points are marked by red squares on both charts. Additionally, univariate analysis suggested ECOG PS as a potential independent predictor for OS.

With an objective response rate (ORR) of 33.3%, disease control rate (DCR) of 88.9%, median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 7.20 months, and median overall survival (mOS) of 12.30 months, BRICS compares favorably with historical controls. Historically, refractory pMMR/MSS CRC patients exhibit dismal outcomes, with mOS typically below 10 months after progression on oxaliplatin/irinotecan-based regimens and anti-angiogenic agents like regorafenib or fruquintinib ( 3 5 14 15 14 16 The proposed foundation of BRICS lies in its temporal orchestration of three synergistic immunomodulatory strategies: stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)-induced antigen release, probiotic-mediated microbiome priming, and metronomic chemotherapy-driven immunosuppressive cell depletion. SBRT may trigger immunogenic cell death, releasing tumor neoantigens that enhance dendritic cell activation and T-cell priming ( 6 vs 7 8 16 12 Notably, BRICS efficacy in CRC appears numerically lower than in our prior NSCLC cohort (ORR: 33.3% vs vs 13 4 17 Univariate and subgroup analyses identified two critical prognostic factors. ECOG PS >2 independently predicted inferior OS (HR = 4.860; p=0.042), with a significant survival disadvantage confirmed in stratified analysis (log-rank p=0.002). Metastatic burden (≥3 organs) independently predicted shorter PFS (HR = 3.179; p=0.026), with stratified analysis confirming significantly reduced PFS (log-rank p=0.015).​​ These findings align with established prognostic models in advanced CRC, and highlight the importance of patient selection ( 18 19 The safety profile remains manageable despite the extended cohort.​​ Grade 3–4 toxicities occurred in 22.2% of patients, primarily hematologic events (neutropenia: 14.8%; thrombocytopenia: 3.7%; anemia: 3.7%). ​This contrasts favorably with regorafenib’s high incidence of hand-foot syndrome (47%) and fatigue (48%) ( 15 16 11 Several limitations warrant acknowledgment. ​First, the retrospective design and modest sample size (n=27) limit statistical power for multivariable analyses. Future larger studies will incorporate this to account for confounders like age and prior therapies. Second, heterogeneity in prior therapies, TKI choices (regorafenib: 40.7%; fruquintinib: 25.9%), and PD-1 inhibitors (toripalimab: 25.9%; sintilimab: 25.9%) may confound efficacy assessments. While this reflects real-world clinical practice, future prospective trials will standardize protocols. Mechanistic validation via scRNA-seq is ongoing. Third, the lack of biomarker data (TMB, TCR clonality, PD-L1, or NGS-confirmed MSI status, fecal microbiome) precludes mechanistic validation of immune conversion. Fourth, 63.0% of patients received <6 BRICS cycles, potentially underestimating the regimen’s full therapeutic potential. In conclusion, this preliminary analysis suggests​ that BRICS ​may offer​ a clinically meaningful approach for refractory pMMR/MSS metastatic CRC. ​However,​​ future prospective randomized trials will standardize protocols to validate these findings, as proposed in our ongoing research plan. Ongoing translational studies, including pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies and fecal microbiome sequencing, will empirically validate these mechanisms in our prospective cohort. In addition, future prospective randomized trials with correlative biomarker studies are ​essential​ to validate these observations and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action.
