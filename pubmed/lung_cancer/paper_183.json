Typically, the frequentist framework is used to draw conclusions about whether hazards are different between patients in an experimental and a control condition. We offer a procedure to compute Bayes factors for simple Cox models, both for the scenario where the full data are available and for the scenario where only summary statistics are available. The procedure is implemented in our ‘baymedr’ R package. The usage of Bayes factors remedies some shortcomings of frequentist inference and has the potential to save scarce resources.

Introduction The biomedical literature is filled with studies in which two conditions are compared on some kind of outcome measure. A common example is a clinical trial in which the goal is to determine the efficacy of a therapeutic agent over a placebo or an already existing medication (e.g.[ 17 29 65 24 58 37 Time-to-event data are typically analyzed using survival analysis 11 12 18 19 22 37 39 in favor 61 2 47 74 p p 1 60 69 We offer a procedure and easy-to-use implementation for hypothesis testing for survival analysis in the Bayesian framework. Specifically, we focus on Cox proportional hazards regression 23  H 0  H 1 28 68 53 The remainder of the article is organized as follows. First, we give an introduction to survival analysis in general and Cox regression in particular. Second, we explain how Bayes factors can be computed and interpreted and apply this to the special case of Cox regression. Third, we showcase how our ‘baymedr’ software can be used to compute a Bayes factor when the full data are available. Fourth, we describe our procedure for the scenario where only summary statistics are available. Specifically, we describe how survival data can be simulated from summary statistics, we tune parameters for the data simulation process, and demonstrate how ‘baymedr’ can be used to compute a distribution of Bayes factors for multiple simulated data sets. Fifth, we compare the performance (in terms of bias and variance) of our approach to an approximation approach advocated by Bartoš and Wagenmakers [ 4 2.

The need for methods for full data and summary statistics The computation of Bayes factors can be challenging for applied researchers who do not have a firm background in Bayesian statistics and programing. Fortunately, multiple software packages are available that allow computing Bayes factors for various research designs. Examples are the R packages ‘BayesFactor’ [ 57 53 40 3 In the next two sections, we showcase how researchers can use our ‘baymedr’ R package [ 53 The files with code for all computations can be found online (available at https://osf.io/37ut2/). 5. Computing a Bayes factor from the full data We applied our approach for computing Bayes factors for Cox models to an empirical data set, as described in Beigel et al. [ 5 n  n c = 521  n e = 541 Beigel et al. [ 5  H 1  H 1  HR > 1  α = .05 5  HR = 1.29  95 %  CI = [ 1.12 ,  1.49 ] 5 Our reanalysis of Beigel et al. [ 5  HR 5  HR = 1.312  95 %  CI = [ 1.136 , 1.514 ] For the reanalysis we used our ‘baymedr’ software, which can be downloaded and installed from GitHub using the ‘devtools’ package [ 79  Using ‘baymedr’, we can compute a Bayes factor for the full data in Beigel et al. [ 5  H 1 β  μ = 0  σ = 1  The obtained Bayes factor of  BF + 0 = 134.401  H 1  H 0 43 50 45 6. Computing Bayes factors from summary statistics Sometimes, the full data might not be available. For example, when conducting a reanalysis of study findings, some researchers might not be allowed (e.g. for ethical reasons) or willing to share the full data. In these situations, it is paramount to be able to use summary statistics reported in the original manuscript to compute a Bayes factor. When the full data are not available, an attractive alternative is to simulate data within the constraints of summary statistics that are known. Following such an approach, it is imperative to demonstrate that the simulated data are sufficiently constrained by the available summary statistics. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach for computing Bayes factors from summary statistics is unique and novel. Therefore, we deem our procedure an important contribution for verifying results of published studies. Our approach for data simulation is based on summary statistics that are commonly reported in scientific articles. Initially, we considered the following candidates: Sample sizes within each condition,  n c  n e Number of events within each condition,  v c  v e Maximum observed or maximum possible survival time,  t max Kaplan-Meier (KM; [ 44  KM c  CI ( KM c ) LB  CI ( KM c ) UB  KM e  CI ( KM e ) LB  CI ( KM e ) UB Hazard ratio obtained from a Cox model [ 23  HR  CI ( HR ) LB  CI ( HR ) UB The first step for simulating data is to sample  n c + n e Y (9) Y ∼ Uniform ( 1 , t max ) .  n c + n e δ (10) δ = [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 ] ,  n c − v c  v c  n e − v e  v e x (11) x = [ 0 , 1 ] ,  n c  n e Y δ x  D S Subsequently, summary statistics for the simulated data are computed. Possibilities are  KM c  CI ( KM c ) LB  CI ( KM c ) UB  KM e  CI ( KM e ) LB  CI ( KM e ) UB  HR  CI ( HR ) LB  CI ( HR ) UB The subsequent optimization procedure involves  n c + n e ξ i  D S  ξ i q  Y i (12) Y i q = e ξ i Y i q − 1 .  ξ i  log ⁡ [ 1 / Y i q − 1 ]  log ⁡ [ t max / Y i q − 1 ]  Y i q  t max Y E O ξ  D S E  D S ξ (13) ϕ ( ξ , D S ) = log ⁡ [ ∑ r = 1 | E | [ ( O r − E r E r w r ) 2 ] 1 | E | ] ,  | E | w  χ 2 w Remembering that  ϕ ( ξ , D S )  ( n c + n e ) O 13 Particle Swarm Optimization 46 66 13 20 59 7 6.1. Tuning of PSO parameters For the tuning of some PSO parameters, we made use of three example data sets: the Kidney [ 55 54 49 70  95 % Importantly, we only used these data sets for the purpose of tuning the weights of summary statistics and the number of iterations in PSO. Therefore, no inferences from our results should be drawn. 6.1.1. Weights of summary statistics The weight vector w 13  μ = 0  σ = 1 β The results are shown in Appendix 1. For all three example data sets, a weight set in which the KM median survival times and the corresponding confidence intervals are not considered and HR is weighted twice as much as the corresponding HR confidence interval boundaries yields Bayes factors with the smallest variance. Moreover, there is almost no bias in the distribution of Bayes factors for the Lung and Colon data sets. A small amount of bias was found for the Kidney data set, which had the smallest sample size (see Figure A1 A1 A2 A3  HR  CI ( HR ) LB  CI ( HR ) UB  t max 6.1.2. Maximum number of PSO iterations Another parameter of interest is the required number of PSO iterations for a satisfactory loss, bias, and variance of Bayes factors. This is especially important because the PSO algorithm is quite time-consuming. The higher the sample size, the larger the number of parameters in PSO and the longer the running time of PSO. To determine an approximate minimum number of PSO iterations, we simulated 100 data sets for each of six different maximum numbers of PSO iterations (i.e. 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000) and computed the Bayes factor. This was repeated for each of the three example data sets. The PSO algorithm stops either when the maximum number of PSO iterations is reached or when no reduction in loss is obtained within one fifth of the maximum number of PSO iterations. Here as well, we used a Normal prior with a mean of  μ = 0  σ = 1 β The results are shown in Appendix 3. Figure A5  HR A6  HR 6.2. Reanalysis of [5] To demonstrate our proposed procedure for simulating data from summary statistics and computing one Bayes factor for each simulated data set, we again reanalyzed the study reported in [ 5 5  HR = 1.312  95 %  CI = [ 1.136 , 1.514 ] 5  HR = 1.29  95 %  CI = [ 1.12 , 1.49 ] 5 Using the ‘baymedr’ R package, we simulated 100 data sets based on the summary statistics as follows:  Subsequently, we computed one Bayes factor for each of the 100 simulated data sets. We used a truncated (because we have a one-sided  H 1 β  μ = 0  σ = 1  A histogram of the resulting Bayes factors can be found in Figure 1  BF + 0 = 133.6  BF + 0 = 135.7 43 50 45 5 5 x Figure 1.

Discussion The analysis of time-to-event data is commonly applied in biomedical research and provides important insights into the effectiveness of therapies. Most often, Cox regression [ 23 53 Our procedure for computing Bayes factors for Cox models is oriented towards analysis strategies that seem prevalent in the biomedical literature: the semi-parametric Cox regression comparing a treatment to a control (or different treatment) condition. The use of Bayes factors specifically allows the important contrast between evidence that an effect is present and evidence than an effect is absent and allows for optional stopping during data collection. At the same time, many features and functionalities are still missing. For example, it would be desirable to also make the Cox partial likelihood [ 23 13 10 14 32 72 36 8.1. Conclusion Cox proportional hazards regression is commonly used to analyze time-to-event data in biomedical research. Typically, the frequentist framework is used to make inferences. We provided a procedure for computing Bayes factors for simple Cox models that can be applied both to the full data set and to summary statistics. The latter could be considered especially important because it allows reanalyzing existing studies to make judgments and decisions about the effectiveness of therapies. We offered ‘baymedr’ [ 53 Acknowledgments We thank Merle-Marie Pittelkow for consulting us on which summary statistics are reported most often in articles that use a Cox proportional hazards regression.

For data simulation (left panel), run times with 1, 2, and 4 CPU cores are shown in purple, green, and yellow, respectively. Figure A7 Appendix 5. Exploration of factors contributing to the accuracy difference between our method and the method by Bartoš and Wagenmakers [ 4 In the main manuscript we found that our method for simulating Bayes factors provides more accurate Bayes factors than the method by Bartoš and Wagenmakers [ 4 2 We took the Kidney, Lung, and Colon data sets and generated data sets of variable sizes through bootstrapping (i.e. sampling with replacement). The sizes of the bootstrapped data sets were  n = { 40 , 80 , 160 , 320 , 640 , 1280 }  3 × 6 × 10 = 180 First, for each bootstrapped data set, we used the full data to compute a Bayes factor using our method. This Bayes factor served as the ‘truth’. Moreover, we applied our approach and the approach by Bartoš and Wagenmakers [ 4 4  log ⁡ ( BF Our / BF True )  log ⁡ ( BF Bartos / BF True ) A8 4 4 Figure A8. Log ratio of the estimated Bayes factor using our method (black) or the method by Bartoš and Wagenmakers [ 4 Second, we explored whether the shape of the likelihood influences the accuracy of the resulting Bayes factors. For our method, we computed the normalized Efron approximation to the true log Cox partial likelihood and for the method by Bartoš and Wagenmakers [ 4 β 6 A9 Figure A9.
