Introduction Gliomas stand as the most prevalent primary brain tumors, contributing significantly to high mortality and recurrence rates. Among them, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form, accounting for approximately 48% of all primary malignant tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 9 18 19 Our previous research has revealed that theabrownin (TB) inhibits cell proliferation through the caspase3-dependent and PTEN/AKT pathways, promotes apoptosis in glioma, and specifically induces cell cycle arrest in glioma cells of different origins via c-Myc and p53 [ 20 21 22 23 The Connectivity Map (CMAP, version 1.1.1.43) is a comprehensive database that establishes correlations between small molecule drugs, gene expression and diseases. It is based on millions of gene expression signatures obtained from millions of perturbation treatments [ 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Normal regulation of the cell cycle progression relies on the involvement and coordination of multiple transcription factors. An abnormal cell cycle significantly promotes the rapid multiplication of cancerous cells [ 35 Building on our prior finding that TB exerts potent anti-proliferative effects in glioma via cell cycle modulation [ 20 36 37 38 39 2. Results 2.1. Transcriptome Sequencing Analysis and Connectivity Map Drug Screening in Human Glioma Cells Building upon previous studies [ 20 50 Figure 1 https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa-human 40 41 Our in-depth analysis focused on identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (listed in Tables S1 and S2 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 42 43 Then, the CMAP tool was used to identify potential therapeutic small molecule compounds ( Figure 1 39 44 To investigate the therapeutic potential of methylstat, we treated HOG and U251 glioma cells, as well as control primary cultured astrocytes, with varying concentrations (0–8 μM) of methylstat. Cell viability was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay at different time points (24, 48, and 72 h). The results demonstrated that methylstat dramatically inhibited glioma cells’ proliferation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1 50 Figure 1 2.2. Methylstat Does Not Induce Glioma Apoptosis To investigate the effects of methylstat on HOG and U251 glioma cells, we conducted fluorescent staining to observe cell morphology after 48 h of methylstat treatment. Compared to the control group, the morphology of the cells in the experimental group underwent significantly changes, and the number of glioma cells was notably reduced. Specifically, methylstat-treated U251 cells exhibited a shrunken morphology with nuclear fragmentation ( Figure 2 Figure 2 To further evaluate whether methylstat induces apoptosis in glioma cells, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining assays. No positive signals indicative of apoptosis were observed in either U251or HOG cells at any of the concentrations tested following methylstat administration ( Figure 3 Figure 3 2.3. Methylstat Inhibits Glioma Cell Proliferation To further elucidate the impact of methylstat on glioma cells, we employed Ki67/EdU immunofluorescence staining. The results demonstrated that methylstat significantly inhibited glioma cells’ proliferation ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 To further verify the effect of methylstat on glioma cell proliferation, we conducted colony formation assays. As anticipated, fewer colonies were formed in both U251 and HOG cells after 19 days of methylstat treatment ( Figure 4 2.4. Methylstat Arrests the Cell Cycle at the G1/S and G2/M Phases in Glioma Cells To further investigate the effects of methylstat on the cell cycle in HOG and U251 cells, we incubated the cells with methylstat and subsequently stained them for cell cycle distribution analysis using flow cytometry. In U251 cells, methylstat treatment led to an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle ( Figure 5 Figure 5 CDK2 p CDK4 p cyclin A p Cyclin D p p p21 p Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 cyclin B CDK1 CDC25C p53 p p21 p Figure 5 Western blot analysis further corroborated the above findings. In U251 cells, it showed decreased expression of CDK4, Cyclin A, and Cyclin D, accompanied by an increase in the protein levels of p21 and p53, with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) used as a loading control ( Figure 5 Figure 5 2.5. Methylstat Reduces the Expression Level of JMJD2A and Inhibits JMJD2A Enzymatic Activity in Glioma Cells Methylstat is known to selectively inhibit JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases in cells [ 38 39 45 46 47 47 48 JMJD2A PDK1 AKT mTOR Figure 6 To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying methylstat’s inhibitory effect, 3D structure modeling of the JMJD2A–methylstat complex was performed using the JMJD2A crystal structure (PDB 2P5B) and the chemical structure of methylstat (PubChem 53392493) [ 48 49 50 Figure 6 To further evaluate the dynamic stability of the JMJD2A–methylstat complex, 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed [ 51 52 Figure 6 Figure 6 2 Figure 6 Table 1 Figure 6 To confirm methylstat’s inhibitory effect on JMJD2A in glioma cells, we assessed the enzyme’s activity using a JMJD2A histone demethylase kit. As anticipated, the results demonstrated that methylstat effectively inhibited the enzymatic activity of JMJD2A in glioma cell lines ( Figure 6 50 The calculation of ΔG for the methylstat–JMJD2 complex was conducted using gmx_MMPBSA in generalized Born (GB) mode, based on 2000 snapshots extracted from MD simulations trajectories spanning 180 to 200 ns. ΔGGAS = ΔEEL + ΔVDW. ΔGSOLV = ΔEGB + ΔESURF. ΔG = ΔGGAS + ΔGSOLV. All energy values were expressed in kcal/mol. 2.6. Methylstat Can Penetrate the BBB Model To investigate the ability of methylstat to penetrate the BBB, we first evaluated an in vivo BBB model co-cultured with mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) and rat glioma cells (C6) ( Figure 7 53 54 Figure 7 In the in vitro BBB model, the quality control standard dictates that the permeability of hydrophilic substances should be controlled to a certain extent. The permeability coefficient of sodium fluorescein (NaFl) can serve as one of the indicators of the success of establishing a barrier model. We drew the NaFl standard curve within the concentration range of 0–40 μg/mL ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 −6 55 56 3. Discussion GBM is a highly aggressive and life-threatening primary brain tumor. These characteristics are largely attributable to its inherent resistance to a broad spectrum of therapeutic strategies. Despite extensive research efforts, GBM persists as one of the most prevalent and formidable primary malignant brain tumors, with patients typically having a median survival of less than 15 months [ 5 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Our previous research confirmed the inhibitory potential of TB, a theaflavin derivative, on glioblastoma via caspase-3-dependent pathways and PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, ultimately leading to cell cycle arrest and proliferation suppression [ 20 57 58 q 20 59 60 c-myc 61 The CMAP platform ranks compounds by connectivity scores (−1 to 1) that quantify transcriptional similarity to the query (TB treatment), prioritizing candidates with positive scores suggesting shared/synergistic effects and reproducible high-magnitude associations. Through this analysis, we identified five drug candidates with the highest positive connectivity scores (mean score ≥ 0.5) ( Figure 1 62 63 64 65 66 39 44 67 Our investigation demonstrated that methylstat substantially curbed the viability of HOG and U251 human glioma cell lines across a 0–8 μM concentration spectrum, with an escalating inhibitory effect as the dosage increased. Primary cultured astrocytes utilized as controls demonstrated significantly higher survival rates at 8 μM, highlighting methylstat’s selective toxicity towards cancerous cells over normal tissue. Microscopic analysis post-methylstat treatment revealed diminished cell counts, altered morphology, and reduced nuclear sizes in glioma cells relative to untreated counterparts ( Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 4 To elucidate the mechanism by which methylstat inhibits cell proliferation, we have conducted flow cytometry analyses on different glioma cell lines (U251 and HOG), revealing source-specific cell cycle arrest. In U251 cells derived from highly malignant astrocytes, Methylstat has induced an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase, evidenced by an upregulation of the tumor suppressor gene p21 Figure 5 Figure 5 68 p53 p53 Moreover, methylstat served as a pivotal regulator of cell proliferation and metastasis, primarily by targeted modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cellular growth and malignant transformation [ 47 PDK1 AKT mTOR Figure 6 JMJD2A, a histone demethylase, plays a pivotal role in the progression of multiple cancer types. In lung and bladder cancers, its overexpression promotes the G1/S phase transition, thereby accelerating tumor cell proliferation [ 69 70 71 72 73 46 47 Figure 6 2 Figure 6 Figure 6 Effective glioma treatment depends on the ability of therapeutic drugs to successfully traverse the BBB. The BBB, as a key physiological barrier, is composed of brain capillary walls (endothelium, basement membrane) and glial cells, which separate the CNS from harmful substances in the blood [ 74 75 76 77 78 −6 55 56 Figure 7 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Lines and Cell Culture Human glioma cell lines U251 and HOG were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and the Feng Lab, Emory University respectively. Primary astrocytes were isolated from the cortex of newborn mice. The mouse brain endothelial cells line bEnd.3 and the rat glioma cell line C6 were prchased from HyCyte Biology (Suzhou, China). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gbico, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ExCell Bio, Shanghai, China) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 5% CO 2 4.2. Drugs and Compound Methylstat (cat: HY-1522, MCE, Shanghai, China) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to prepare a 20 mM stock solution, stored at −20 °C. Before each experiment, it was diluted with complete culture medium to produce the necessary concentration gradients. TB (cat: CN20131038721) was obtained from Hangzhou Minghe Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China). 4.3. Screening Differentially Expressed Genes and CMAP Analysis To identify genome-wide differentially expressed genes, HOG and U251 cells were treated with 150 μg/mL and 200 μg/mL TB, respectively, for 4 h. Total RNA was then extracted using Trizol reagent. Based on the Sequencing By Synthesis (SBS) technology, the cDNA library was sequenced on the high-throughput sequencing platform of Biomarker Bio-tech (Qingdao, China). The assigned human genome (version: homo_sapiens.grch38_release.genom.fa) was used as a reference for sequence alignment and subsequent analysis. DEGs between TB-treated cells and control cells were identified through DESeq2 analysis, in accordance with the established statistical and fold-change thresholds (fold change ≥ 2, p https://clue.io/ 79 4.4. Methylstat-JMJD2A: Molecular Docking and Dynamics Analysis The interaction between JMJD2A and methylstat was studied using molecular simulation. The crystal structure of receptor JMJD2A was obtained from Protein Data Bank (accession ID:2P5B) with the of resolution of 1.99 Å [ 48 49 50 80 81 51 52 4.5. Cell Viability Assay U251 and HOG cell lines were trypsinized and seeded into 96-well microplates at a density of 5 × 10 3 50 4.6. Cell Morphology and DAPI Staining Methylstat-treated U251 and HOG cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were stained with DAPI for 10 min. The stained cells images were observed under a fluorescence microscope to examine the apoptotic nuclei. 4.7. Flow Cytometry for Cell Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Analysis Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 10 5 4.8. Colony Formation Assay Approximately 5000 GBM cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 10 days. The colonies were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with crystal violet (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for one hour. The colonies were then washed with PBS and the number of colonies was counted. 4.9. TUNEL Assay HOG and U251 cells were cultured and seeded onto 24-well plates. After 48 h treatment with methylstat, cell apoptosis was evaluated using a TUNEL Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with 0.2% Triton-X 100 for 5 min. Then, the cells were incubated with TdT incubation solution at at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Finally, the cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI at room temperature for 10 min. The stained cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope. 4.10. EdU and KI67 Assay Different concentrations of methylstat were added to U251 and HOG cells for 48 h. Cell proliferation was evaluated using an EdU Cell Proliferation Kit with Alexa Fluor 555 (Epizyme, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were incubated with 20 μM of 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine at 37 °C for 2 h and fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature. The glioma cells were permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked with 5% goat serum for 30 min, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary antibodies. The cells were then incubated with fluorescent second antibodies at room temperature for one hour. Afterward, Click reagent was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst for 10 min. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope, and the rates of Ki67 and EDU positive cells were calculated. 4.11. Real-Time PCR Analysis After methylstat treatment, total RNA of cells was extracted using Trizol, and reverse transcription was performed using the HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Target genes were amplified with ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) and measured using a CFX96™ Real-time System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the reference gene, and the specific primers for the genes are listed in Table S3 4.12. Western Blot Analysis Following methylstat treatment, U251 and HOG cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing protease inhibitor for 30 min on ice. The cells were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min, and the protein concentration was measured using a Pierce BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The membranes were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature and visualized using BeyoECL Star (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Protein bands were detected using the ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Detailed information on the primary and secondary antibodies used is provided in Table S4 4.13. In Vitro BBB Model Setup C6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 5 2 4 2 ® 4.14. Four-Hour Permeation Test After 5 days of co-culture, the top part of the insert was replaced with 300 μL of DMEM medium, while the bottom of the 24-well plate was filled with 500 μL of C6 medium to maintain a consistent liquid level disparity. After 4 h incubation at 37 °C, no notable alteration in the liquid level disparity was observed compared with the control group, indicating close fusion of the cells. 4.15. In Vitro Permeability Assay In vitro NaFl permeability was used to evaluate endothelial integrity. The endothelial permeability coefficients for fluorescein served as an indicator of a successful cell barrier model. NaFl was mixed into DMEM basic medium at varying concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μg/mL, and its absorbance at 530 nm was measured to establish a standard curve. The culture medium was removed from the upper and bottom chambers and replaced with 300 μL of NaFl (20 μg/mL) diluted in DMEM and 500 μL of DMEM alone, respectively. After 4 h for NaFl treatment, 10 μL of the medium from the top chamber medium and 100 μL of the medium from the bottom chamber was sampled. The OD values was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader, and the transmembrane permeability coefficient was calculated using the previously established formula. 4.16. Drug Transport Through the In Vitro BBB Model The co-cultured BBB model described above was used to test the permeability of methylstat. Into the Transwell ® 4.17. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments performed. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student’s t p p p p 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence that methylstat, which was identified through the CMAP platform, exhibits potent anti-glioma effects. It accomplishes this by selectively targeting and inhibiting JMJD2A, a histone demethylase that plays a complex and crucial role in tumor proliferation across a diverse range of cancers.
