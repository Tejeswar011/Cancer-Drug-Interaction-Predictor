Findings In this diagnostic study including 3525 patients, diagnostic delays exceeded 24 hours in 79.43% of cases at the first institution and 82.38% of cases at the second institution; delays exceeded 72 hours in 69.89% of cases at the first institution and 71.31% of cases at the second institution. Delayed VTE diagnoses were associated with higher 30-day all-cause mortality. Meaning These findings suggest that the electronic clinical quality measure was able to quantify delays in diagnosing VTE across care settings and could be used to guide quality improvement efforts. This diagnostic study examines rates of diagnostic delay of venous thromboembolism at 2 health care systems and assesses the association of such diagnostic delays with 30-day all-cause mortality. Importance Nonspecific symptoms of venous thromboembolism (VTE) hinder timely recognition, and no automated tools exist to monitor diagnostic delay. Objective To evaluate rates of diagnostic delay of VTE (DOVE) at 2 health care systems using different electronic health record (EHR) systems, to categorize missed diagnoses, and to assess the association of diagnostic delays with 30-day all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants This diagnostic study used retrospective EHR data from Mass General Brigham (MGB) and Penn State Health (PSH). For MGB, data from 2016 to 2021 were extracted, whereas for PSH, data from 2019 to 2022 data were used. An electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) was developed and used to quantify DOVE. The eCQM analyses were conducted from 2020 to 2022 at MGB and from 2022 to 2023 at PSH; mortality analyses were conducted from 2023 to 2024. Patients with VTE and documented VTE-related symptoms in primary care were included. Exposure Diagnosis of VTE. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were DOVE rates and 30-day all-cause mortality by time to diagnosis. DOVE rates were calculated using thresholds of greater than 24 hours and greater than 72 hours, validated through EHR review. Missed opportunities were categorized into system, practitioner, patient, and other unclassified factors. Thirty-day all-cause mortality and risk ratios (RRs) were compared between timely (≤24 hours) and delayed (>24 hours) diagnosis. Results A total of 3525 patients were included; 3281 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.95 [15.14] years; 1692 [51.57%] female) were from MGB, and 244 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.34 [16.76] years; 128 [52.46%] female) were from PSH. DOVE eCQM rates using the greater than 24-hour definition were 79.43% (95% CI, 78.00%-81.00%) for MGB and 82.38% (95% CI, 77.00%-87.00%) for PSH. The DOVE rate using the greater than 72-hour definition was 69.89% (95% CI, 68.00%-71.00%) for MGB and 71.31% (95% CI, 65.00%-77.00%) for PSH. Practitioner-related delays were most common. At MGB, mortality increased from 17 deaths (2.52%) for timely diagnosis to 217 deaths (8.33%) for delayed diagnoses, with an RR of 3.31 (95% CI, 2.03-5.38). At PSH, mortality increased from 2 deaths (4.65%) to 12 deaths (5.97%) with an RR of 1.28 (95% CI, 0.30-5.53). Diagnosis at less than 24 hours was often associated with missed pulmonary embolism leading to death. Conclusions and Relevance In this diagnostic study of delayed VTE diagnosis, consistently high DOVE rates and associated increases in all-cause mortality support the use of the DOVE eCQM tool to guide quality improvement efforts at institutional, regional, and national levels. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf no pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, preventable public health problem affecting approximately 300 000 to 600 000 individuals in the US each year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Our team developed an electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) that uses electronic health record (EHR) data to measure diagnostic delay of VTE (DOVE) in primary care settings, 9 10 11 This study aims to analyze delayed VTE diagnosis using both greater than 24-hour and greater than 72-hour definitions, categorize missed diagnostic opportunities, and examine the potential association of VTE diagnostic delay in primary care with all-cause mortality. We specifically aimed to (1) assess the feasibility of implementing the DOVE eCQM in geographically distant integrated care systems using different EHR systems, (2) compare DOVE eCQM rates in the 2 systems using both greater than 24-hour and greater than 72-hour definitions, (3) validate the DOVE eCQM with experts to categorize the cause of missed diagnostic opportunities, and (4) investigate the association between delays in VTE diagnosis and 30-day all-cause mortality. Methods Study Settings In this diagnostic study, we conducted testing within 2 integrated delivery networks: Mass General Brigham (MGB; Boston, Massachusetts) and Penn State Health (PSH; Hershey, Pennsylvania). MGB uses the Epic system, whereas PSH uses the Oracle/Cerner EHR system. Primary care practices using the enterprise EHR for up to 5 years were included in the study. For MGB, data from 2016 to 2021 were extracted, whereas for PSH, data from 2019 to 2022 data were used. The eCQM analyses were conducted from 2020 to 2022 at MGB and from 2022 to 2023 at PSH; mortality analyses were conducted from 2023 to 2024. Race and ethnicity were patient-reported and documented in the EHR using predefined categories (ie, African American or Black, Hispanic, White, and other, which includes American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and race self-reported as other) to assess potential disparities in outcomes. The study and waiver of informed consent for data use were approved by the institutional review boards of MGB and PSH; consent was waived because data were deidentified, in accordance with 45 CFR §46. This study follows the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis ( TRIPOD The DOVE eCQM Specifications The DOVE eCQM consists of 2 components: first, an EHR-derived phenotyping algorithm was used to identify incident cases of VTE ( Figure Supplement 1 12 International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision Current Procedural Terminology 13 Supplement 1 Supplement 1 Figure. Process for Identifying Eligible Patients and Incident Cases of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Figure illustrates the steps for identifying eligible patients for the diagnostic delay of VTE (DOVE) electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM). Incident VTE cases were defined using a validated algorithm requiring diagnostic, imaging, and treatment criteria. Each case was linked to a primary care practitioner (PCP) visit within the prior 30 days containing VTE-related symptoms, identified via natural language processing (NLP). Patients aged 18 years or older with no prior VTE and not receiving end-of-life care were included. The DOVE rate reflects the proportion diagnosed more than 24 hours after the index visit. CPT Current Procedural Terminology ICD-10 International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. The DOVE eCQM Performance Calculation We first evaluated the reliability of data by calculating the frequency of the required data elements needed for the measure. Subsequently, we calculated DOVE rates and 95% CIs, including for the greater than 24-hour time frame and for a greater than 72-hour time frame as requested by CMS. Using national quality measure submission standards, 14 15 Validation of DOVE eCQM Trained clinicians, 2 from each site (MGB, M.J.K. and V.K.B.; PSH, R.S. and S.H.), completed measure validity testing through an EHR review. Manual EHR review classifications (ie, criterion standard) were compared with those produced by the eCQM, and the positive predictive value (PPV), NPV, and accuracy were calculated. In addition, reviewers classified missed opportunities for timely diagnosis according to practitioner, medical system, and patient factors or unclassified (unable to classify). 16 17 18 Statistical Analysis Thirty-day all-cause mortality was defined as death from any cause occurring within 30 days of the confirmed VTE diagnosis. We calculated 30-day all-cause mortality and risk ratios (RRs) associated with time to VTE diagnosis for both sites. RRs were calculated relative to timely diagnosis compared with those delayed diagnosis cases. Mortality data were identified using death information documented in the EHR, and time to death was calculated from the time of the VTE confirmed diagnosis to death. The RRs for death within 30 days were estimated using generalized estimating equations for binary outcomes (death within 30 days) clustering by practice, with a log-link and time to VTE as the only covariate. The log-link allows us to exponentiate the regression coefficient to obtain the RR, as well as obtain 95% CIs and 2-sided P P To further understand the association between VTE and VTE-related mortality, we subdivided our analysis by VTE type as either PE or non-PE (DVT and others) using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision Results The study included 3525 adults with VTE and documented symptoms in primary care; 3281 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.95 [15.14] years; 1692 [51.57%] female) were from MGB, and 244 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.34 [16.76] years; 128 [52.46%] female) were from PSH. With regard to race and ethnicity, 305 patients (8.65%) were African American or Black, 223 (6.38%) were Hispanic, 2896 (82.16%) were White, and 324 (9.19%) were other races. Most had public (1966 patients [55.77%]) or private (1543 patients [43.77%]) insurance, and 3272 (92.82%) reported English as their first language ( Table 1 Table 1.

Data Elements Availability and Frequency Calculation Data needed to calculate the measures were available in the EHR databases of both sites. A total of 1.5% of ethnicity data were missing among MGB encounters, whereas no data elements were missing for PSH encounters. We identified 3281 DOVE eCQM–eligible denominator encounters at MGB and 244 at PSH, defined as encounters with both a VTE diagnosis and documented VTE-related symptoms in primary care visit notes. These encounters took place across 187 primary practices at MGB and 19 practices at PSH ( Table 1 The DOVE eCQM Performance Calculation The rate of VTE diagnostic delay of adults in primary care using the greater than 24-hour definition was 79.43% (95% CI, 78.00%-81.00%) for MGB and 82.38% (95% CI, 77.00%-87.00%) for PSH. The DOVE rate using the greater than 72-hour definition was 69.89% (95% CI, 68.00%-71.00%) for MGB and 71.31% (95% CI, 65.00%-77.00%) for PSH. Primary care practices group-level DOVE performance scores ranged from 0.59% to 0.95% for the 24-hour time frame and from 0.43% to 0.90% for the 72-hour time frame at MGB. At PSH, the DOVE performance scores ranged from 0.72% to 0.95% for the 24-hour time frame and 0.64% to 0.85% for the 72-hour time frame ( Table 2 Table 2 Table 2.

EHR Review Findings EHR reviews from both sites indicated that practitioner-related delays were the most frequent, followed by unclassified delays ( Table 3 To further understand the nature of these delays, we hypothesized 3 types of VTE diagnosis: (1) VTE identified during the index visit but diagnosed after 24 hours, typically during hospital admission, (2) VTE not detected during the index visit but diagnosed during a subsequent office visit, and (3) unclassified delays with unclear origins. We then randomly selected and conducted 30 additional EHR reviews. In some cases, it was unclear whether the VTE developed gradually from symptoms noted during the index primary care visit (suggesting a possible physician-induced delay) or whether a new VTE had developed in the intervening period. Additional EHR reviews identified cases where patients exhibited VTE symptoms at the index visit that were not diagnosed, and subsequently experienced scenarios within 30 days that increased their risk for VTE. In these cases, it was challenging to determine whether the situation represented delayed VTE diagnosis or development of a new VTE due to new medical events, such as surgery, a fall, or taking a long-distance flight, all of which are known risk factors for VTE. 19 20 21 Thirty-Day All-Cause Mortality Calculation Based on the Time Frame to VTE Diagnosis At MGB, 30-day all-cause mortality significantly increased as time to VTE diagnosis increased. Mortality increased from 17 deaths (2.52%) for diagnoses within 24 hours to 217 deaths (8.33%) for diagnoses after 24 hours, with an RR of 3.31 (95% CI, 2.03-5.38; P P Table 4 Table 4.

Across both time frames to VTE diagnosis (within and beyond 24 hours), the proportion of patients who received a diagnosis of PE was higher in the deceased patient group, whereas DVT or other types of embolism were more common among survivors (eTable 1 in Supplement 1 Supplement 1 Discussion In this diagnostic study, we evaluated the feasibility of implementing a DOVE eCQM in 2 integrated care delivery systems. We also quantified the frequency of DOVE among patients who reported VTE symptoms during primary care visits. We found that the DOVE eCQM could be applied using different EHR vendor systems, as the necessary data elements were routinely available. We also found that the delayed VTE diagnosis rates were high across systems regardless of whether the greater than 24-hour or greater than 72-hour definitions were used, with all-cause mortality risk increasing with longer diagnostic delays. Practitioner-related factors were the most common cause of diagnostic delay. The DOVE eCQM allows for systematic capture of VTE diagnostic delay, which has been a persistent challenge despite advancements in diagnostic methods. Our manual EHR review confirmed that nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms often hinder timely VTE recognition. 7 8 22 The absence of a standardized time frame for measuring VTE diagnostic delays complicates comparisons of delay rates across institutions and at the national level. 23 24 25 26 6 Considering the association between delayed diagnosis and increased mortality and that the most common reason for delay is practitioner recognition of VTE (not securing a scan), we consulted with the Brigham and Women’s Hospital DOVE technical expert panel and recommend the greater than 24-hour definition of VTE diagnostic delay. Given the potential consequences of diagnostic delays, adopting this conservative time frame even with the small risk of false-positives seems justified to enhance patient safety in primary care settings. Our team presented these results in the spring of 2024 to the CMS committee, which included the DOVE eCQM on the 2024 Measures Under Consideration list. The DOVE eCQM was approved through the federal Medicare rule-making program January 2025. 27 The DOVE eCQM leverages readily available EHR data, allowing health care practitioners to efficiently track and monitor VTE diagnostic delay. Its streamlined design enables integration into existing clinical workflows, providing a practical foundation for developing and implementing quality improvement initiatives aimed at reducing VTE diagnostic delays. Furthermore, benchmarking DOVE eCQM rates and integrating clinical decision support (CDS) systems in primary care may reduce VTE diagnostic delays, particularly those attributed to practitioner factors, which our study identified as a leading cause of delayed VTE diagnoses. Although the DOVE eCQM is designed for measurement and benchmarking, CDS is also needed for identifying patients with vague or overlooked symptoms during primary care visits. By prompting earlier clinical suspicion of VTE, CDS can lead to timely recognition and follow-up actions, such as ordering a D-dimer test, and can reduce unnecessary reliance on costly imaging. 28 29 30 31 32 33 Limitations Our study has limitations. The delivery systems evaluated may differ from other integrated systems, although the 2 were in different regions, used different EHRs, and included practices in urban, metropolitan, and rural areas. This study includes patients whose VTE symptoms were recorded in primary care, suggesting that asymptomatic patients were not captured. This study analyzed primary care visits only, so we lack data on the validity of applying this eCQM to specialty or other ambulatory practices. The 24-hour diagnostic threshold was selected on the basis of expert guidance and CMS-aligned quality measurement standards. EHR review findings and mortality patterns support its clinical relevance, although future work will explore continuous time-to-diagnosis approaches. Confounding and competing risks remain possible, and some deaths may not be attributable to the delayed diagnosis of VTE. Future research should consider more granular outcomes, such as VTE-specific mortality, or competing risk modeling to further isolate the associations of diagnostic delay with VTE-related outcomes. Furthermore, mortality data were obtained solely from EHR documentation and were not supplemented with external sources such as vital records or claims data, which may have led to underascertainment of deaths, particularly those occurring outside the health systems. Similarly, VTE events diagnosed at unaffiliated institutions may have been missed. These limitations could result in misclassification. However, both diagnostic groups were drawn from the same EHR populations, reducing the likelihood of differential bias in mortality comparisons. Although the NLP platform is readily available, some sites may feel ill-prepared to adopt NLP for this measure. 13 34 Conclusions In this diagnostic study of delayed diagnosis of VTE, we evaluated the DOVE eCQM, a systematically designed tool to measure delayed VTE diagnosis in primary care using EHR data. Such tools are needed to address diagnostic delays in outpatient settings. We validated the DOVE eCQM across 2 different EHR systems and found that delayed VTE diagnosis was associated with risk of higher all-cause mortality, underscoring the need for timely detection and treatment. The DOVE eCQM could provide a strong foundation for ongoing quality monitoring and improvement, ultimately advancing patient safety and outcomes.
