The analysis incorporates two publicly available datasets (Shenzhen and Wuhan cohorts) and three newly generated datasets (Beijing, Suzhou, and Shanghai cohorts). Each cohort provides distinct clinical and methodological contributions: (a) The Shenzhen cohort (sampled in 2016) includes specimens from both healthy controls and pneumonia patients, enabling comparative analyses between infected and uninfected populations. (b) The Wuhan cohort (sampled in 2021) contains bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens exclusively from patients with severe or moderate MPP. (c) The Suzhou cohort (predominantly sampled in 2023) consists entirely of BALF specimens from patients with severe MPP infections and includes comprehensive hospitalization metrics. (d) The Beijing cohort (sampled from 2017 to 2023) incorporates diverse specimen types including oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and BALF, along with hospitalization duration data, though it lacks formal severity stratification. (e) the Shanghai cohort (sampled from 2017 to 2023) features both sputum and BALF specimens accompanied by extensive clinical diagnostics and detailed patient metadata, providing the most comprehensive clinical characterization among all cohorts. We designated the Shanghai cohort as the primary analytical cohort due to its superior clinical granularity, while employing other cohorts for validation purposes. Both the Shenzhen and Shanghai cohorts contain longitudinal specimens collected from multiple respiratory anatomical sites within the same patients. Comprehensive patient-specific metadata cross-referenced with corresponding respiratory sample characteristics are archived in Supplementary Data S1. Clinical information All patients with pneumonia were enrolled in the study after confirmed infection with M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae According to the Chinese guidelines on CAP, severe MPP (SMPP) was defined as the presence of one or more of the following manifestations: (1) poor conditions; (2) consciousness disorder; (3) hypoxemia: marked increase in respiratory rate, assisted respiration, intermittent apnea or O 2 Clinical information was retrospectively collected from patients’ medical records. The clinical information included age, sex, total fever duration, length of hospital stay, polyinfection, hypoxemia, wheezes or dyspnea, extrapulmonary complications and antibiotic application data. Laboratory data included white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count (NE), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17 (IL-17), serum ferritin (SF), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, CD4 + + + + + + + + Pathogen detection A multiplex PCR-based platform was utilized to detect M. pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae M. pneumoniae Multiplex PCR Genomic DNA extraction Kit, QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit from Qiagen, Germany, Cat No51306; The PCR reagent (Ex Taq® Hot Start Version, Code No RR006A) and DL2000 DNA Marker (Code No 3427A) were purchased from TAKARA Company in Japan. Veriti® Thermal cyclist (Applied Biosystems, USA) Gel imager (Bio-Rad Company, USA) Vitek Fully automatic Bacterial Analyzer and API Identification System (Biomerieux, France). PCR (25 μL): F (10 μmol/L), R (10 μmol/L), DNA (10 μmol/L), TaKaRa Ex Taq HS (5U/μL), 0.2 μL, 10×Ex Taq Buffer (20 mM, Mg 2+ Sample collection NP/OP collection: (1) Tools: nasopharyngeal swab/oropharyngeal swab, alcohol, cotton swab, hand sanitizer, etc. (2) Disinfection: The samplers use hand sanitizer to disinfect their hands, keep them clean, and wear masks to prevent contamination. (3) Sample collection: (a) NP: The patients head was slightly tilted back, and wiped the inside and around the nostrils. The wiping depth should reach the nasal mucosa. (b) OP: Assisted by a tongue depressor, the posterior pharyngeal wall is fully exposed. The swab is then sent into the mouth to wipe the secretions from the palatine arches and tonsils on both sides. (4) Sample processing: After collection is completed, place the swab in the preservation solution and send it to the laboratory for processing. Sputum collection: The sampler should wear a mask and protect their hands with sterile gloves. The patient should first rinse their mouth with clean water to remove debris and bacteria in the mouth and reduce contamination. After taking several deep breaths, patient should forcefully cough out the deep sputum to avoid mixing it with saliva or nasopharyngeal secretions. The sputum should be directly placed in a test tube or a sealed container and sent for examination. BALF collection method: First, through the biopsy hole of the lavage lung segment, 1–2 ml of 2% lidocaine is injected via a thin silicone tube to perform local anaesthesia on the lavage lung segment; then, the tip of the bronchoscope is tightly wedged into the opening of the target bronchial segment or subsegment, and 37°C sterilized normal saline is rapidly injected through the biopsy hole via the silicone tube. The total volume of the saline is 100–250 ml (generally not more than 300 ml), divided into 3–5 portions, with each portion being 25–60 ml for perfusion. Immediately after perfusion, use 50–100 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) negative pressure suction to recover the lavage fluid. Site selection: For localized lesions, the lesion segment is selected; for diffuse lesions, the right middle lobe or the upper lingular segment of the left lung is selected. The specimens are divided and placed in different sterile test tubes or clean test tubes according to the detection purpose. Specimens for pathogen analysis need to be collected in sterile containers. The specimen volume should be no less than 3 ml. Qualified BALF specimens: (a)Recovery rate > 40%; for lavage of other lung segments or lung lobes, the recovery rate > 30%. (b)No blood mixed in, red blood cells < 10%, epithelial cells < 5%. Nucleic acid extraction DNA was extracted from pretreated samples (BALF, NP, OP) from CAP patients and utilized for further DNA library construction. To prepare these samples, a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 500 μL of sample and 1 g of 0.5 mm glass beads was vigorously agitated on a horizontal platform of a vortex mixer at 2800–3200 rpm for 30 minutes. Subsequently, 300 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and combined with 0.2 ng of internal DNA control. DNA extraction followed using the TIANamp Micro DNA Kit (DP316, TIANGEN BIOTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA was quantified using Qubit, and 100 ng of DNA was allocated for the subsequent library construction. If the DNA yield was less than 100 ng, the entire DNA extract from the sample was used for library construction. Library preparation and sequencing The DNA library was constructed through a process involving DNA fragmentation, end-repair, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification. The constructed library was then qualified using the Agilent 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen, USA), ensuring a concentration of at least 1 ng/μL. The qualified double-stranded DNA library was converted into a single-stranded circular DNA library through DNA denaturation and circularization. DNA nanoballs (DNBs) were produced from the single-stranded circular DNA using rolling circle amplification (RCA) and qualified with Qubit 2.0. The qualified DNBs were loaded onto the flow cell and sequenced on the MGISEQ-2000 platform (MGI, China). It was required that the sequencing yielded more than 15 million reads. Taxonomic profile of the metagenomes The bacterial compositions in metagenomes were analyzed using SPARSE with default parameters [ 21 22 23 Neutral community model We employed the neutral community model (NCM) to evaluate the influence of stochastic processes on the assembly of microbial communities [ 24 25 2 To apply the neutral community model (NCM), we classified the genera within the datasets into three partitions based on their occurrence relative to the model's predictions: taxa that occurred more frequently than the upper limit of the 97.5% confidence interval (above partition), those that occurred less frequently than the lower limit (below partition), and those that fell within the confidence interval (neutral partition). Construction of severity risk (SR) model Random forest analysis was performed on the Shanghai cohort using the Python module “scikit-learn.” Briefly, samples were randomly split into training (80%) or test (20%) subsets. The model was trained on the training dataset, with hyperparameters optimized using 5-fold cross-validation using the GridSearchCV function. Final model performance was evaluated on the test set. We evaluated the contribution of each genus on the classification using the permutation approach (permutation_importance function in scikit-learn), expressing the values as mean ± SEM. Based on these results, genera were ranked by importance. We then iteratively assessed model performance using increasing numbers of top-ranked genera (Figure S2(c)). Mode l accuracy plateaued when the top eight genera were included; these were used to construct the final SR model following the same training and evaluation procedures. An SR score was defined as the predicted probability of a sample being classified into the HSC. To evaluate its clinical relevance, we constructed a correlation network between SR scores and clinical indicators using Pearson's correlation coefficient, confirming associations between SR scores and infection severity. External validation was performed using four independent cohorts. In the Shenzhen cohort, one-way ANOVA was used to compare SR scores between healthy and diseased individuals. In the Wuhan cohort, SR scores were compared between GMPP and SMPP patients using one-way ANOVA. For the Suzhou and Beijing cohorts, Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationship between SR scores and total hospitalization duration. These analyses collectively support the association between respiratory microbiota composition and infection severity. Construction of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model The SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model is a classical framework in epidemiological transmission analysis, characterizing population distributions of susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) individuals. Drawing an analogy to microbial ecology, we propose that bacterial species within a microbial community may undergo a similar transition dynamic during pathogen invasion, with “susceptible” communities being vulnerable to colonization, “infected” states reflecting successful pathogen establishment, and “recovered” states corresponding to a return to a stable, pathogen-resistant configuration. The bimodal distribution of M. pneumoniae Figure 1 Figure 1. Clinical background and microbiota distribution in M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae In this study, we adapted the SIR model to simulate the ecological invasion process of M. pneumoniae The model incorporates two primary parameters: the transmission rate (β), which reflects the likelihood of pathogen establishment within susceptible communities, and the recovery rate (γ), which represents the rate at which communities return to a pathogen-resistant state. We estimated these parameters for both high-severity (HSC) and low-severity (LSC) community groups by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of observed SR score transitions. Simulations using identical initial conditions revealed divergent invasion trajectories between HSC and LSC groups, consistent with empirical data. These results support the applicability of the SIR model for capturing the dynamics of M. pneumoniae Statistical analysis Quantitatively normal or nearly normal data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation and analyzed using the t-test. Quantitative skewness data were presented as the median (interquartile range, IQR) and analyzed using the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney rank-sum test. Categorical data are expressed as frequencies and examined using the chi-square test. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the differences between patients in the GMPP group and SMPP group, the differences between patients with older children (ages 6–18) and younger children(ages 0–6), and the differences between before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analysis was performed to select the variables associated with SMPP. We used the binary Logistic regression method to study the influencing factors of the severity of MPP while excluding the interference of confounding factors such as antibiotic use, and introduced other factors (such as gender, age, year, etc.) for correction. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to evaluate microbial diversity and microbial abundance between the two groups. Spearman correlation coefficient or multiple regression logic analysis was used to test the correlation between microorganisms and clinical features. Alpha-diversity indexes were calculated using the R package vegan (2.6–8). The metabolic enrichment analysis was also performed using the R package clusterProfiler (v4.12.6) [ 26 27 28 29 Results Clinical information of cohorts from five Chinese megacities We collected 303 respiratory samples from 297 patients with M. pneumoniae n n n n n Figure 1 Detail clinical information was obtained from the Shanghai cohort (Supplementary Data S1), which indicated that SMPP patients ( n P P n P P P P P + + P Increased M. pneumoniae The metagenomic analysis of the Shanghai cohort further revealed that GMPP patients exhibited significantly higher microbiome diversity compared to SMPP patients, as indicated by Simpson diversity indices of 0.20 ± 0.32 for SMPP and 0.36 ± 0.37 for GMPP ( P P Leptotrichia sp., Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Lachnoanaerobaculum orale M. pneumoniae Figure 1 M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae + + Figure 1 Notably, we revealed a bimodal distribution of M. pneumoniae Figure 1 .

Severity risk (SR) prediction model identified key bacterial genera in antagonistic modules The Neutral Community Model (NCM) evaluates the structural assemblies of the species in a community by assuming that species have equal probabilities of birth and death. We used the NCM model to assess the assembly randomness of microbial communities in LSC and HSC samples ( Figure 3 Figure 3. Neutral Community Model and Severity Risk Model.

Track dynamics of M. pneumoniae Previously, we observed a resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae 3 Post-pandemic patients exhibited significantly elevated IL-2 and IL-17 levels, indicative of a heightened inflammatory response, alongside lower LDH levels and diminished CD4 + + Figure 4 M. pneumoniae Model validation with respiratory metagenomic datasets from other megacities cohorts We evaluated the performance of the SR model across all cohorts.

First, we consistently observed the bimodal distribution pattern of M. pneumoniae Figure 5 M. pneumoniae Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5. Demographic factor analysis based on the integrated dataset. (a) M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae Furthermore, we validated the species diversity conclusions between SMPP and GMPP samples using the integrated dataset. The results demonstrate consistent alignment with prior findings: after combining datasets from Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuhan with clinical severity diagnostic information, SMPP samples continued to exhibit significantly lower alpha diversity compared to GMPP samples (Figure S2(f)). Additionally, integrated dataset analysis confirms significantly higher SR scores in SMPP relative to GMPP (Figure S2(g)), reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions. These provide additional confirmation of the association between microbial diversity and infection severity. Discussion Following the COVID-19 pandemic, consecutive outbreaks of respiratory infections were reported globally, with each linked to distinct regions and time frames [ 33 34 M. pneumoniae 35 36 Our study employed a multidisciplinary approach, integrating clinical, epidemiological, and metagenomic data, to investigate the interactions between M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae 37 38 39–41 42–44 45 Otherwise, our findings indicate that critically ill patients exhibit elevated levels of white blood cells and inflammatory factors alongside reduced immune cell counts; however, a more detailed immune function profile remains to be explored. For instance, Lian et al. demonstrated that distinct macrophage subtypes significantly influence SARS-CoV-2 infection severity [ 46 47 48 M. pneumoniae A significant finding of this study is the presence of two distinct bacterial communities associated with different clinical outcomes: a protective bacterial community in the LSC and a disease-associated community in the HSC. The LSC exhibited a higher diversity of bacterial species, particularly with a notable presence of Streptococcus Prevotella 49 Streptococcus pneumoniae 50 Streptococcus salivarius 51 52 Prevotella Streptococcus pneumoniae 53 54 55 56 57 Conversely, the HSC was characterized by an overrepresentation of opportunistic pathogens from the Proteobacteria phylum, including Moraxella 58 59 Our identification of the two antagonistic bacterial modules suggested that the presence of a balanced and diverse microbial community, as seen in the LSC, may serve as a protective factor against severe respiratory illness, while disruption in this balance predisposes the host to more severe disease, as seen in the HSC. Similar antagonistic bacterial modules have been found in other body sites, such as guts [ 60 61 62 In contrast, other microbiomes were able to prevent MP from rapidly invading, with MP accounting for only a small proportion of the bacterial population even after infection. This pattern, observed in the LSC, suggests that a diverse microbial community can play a protective role by limiting pathogen expansion, possibly through competitive exclusion, immune modulation, or maintaining epithelial barrier integrity [ 63 64 M. pneumoniae The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the composition and function of the human respiratory microbiome, which may have long-lasting implications for global health [ 65 66 67 68 M. pneumoniae Bacterial substances in the lungs are associated with cytokines and pulmonary inflammatory markers (such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in the activation of inflammatory vesicles. For instance, in severe COVID-19 patients, these markers are related to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [ 69 Our study also revealed that the post-COVID-19 immune landscape may contribute to increased susceptibility to severe infections. We observed a higher proportion of SMPP cases and viral co-infections post-pandemic, suggesting that immune dysfunction and microbiome disruption following COVID-19 may exacerbate the clinical course of M. pneumoniae These findings have broad implications for global health, particularly in the context of infection susceptibility and disease severity in the post-pandemic era. The altered microbiome could make populations more vulnerable to secondary bacterial infections and potentially lead to more severe disease outcomes, especially in high-risk groups such as children and the elderly. Additionally, the observed microbiome shifts raise concerns about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on respiratory health, which may increase the burden of respiratory diseases globally [ 70 Virus-bacterial interactions play an important role in respiratory tract infections, especially in M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae 71 M. pneumoniae 72 M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae M. pneumoniae This study has several limitations. The retrospective nature of the research, coupled with concurrently collected data (lacking truly longitudinal data), restricts our ability to capture the dynamic evolution of infections. Additionally, constraints in specific sample sizes (e.g. small sample sizes for viral co-infections, host demographic factors, and complex disease states) undermine the robustness of the experimental conclusions. Although five major cities were included, our findings may not fully represent the paediatric population in China. Moreover, the results still lack reliable experimental validation, necessitating caution when generalizing these outcomes. To minimize geographical specificities (such as medical practices) and batch effects, we confined metagenomic analysis and model training to the Shanghai cohort and used the other four cohorts for external validation. However, while this validation approach preserves regional specificity, it reduces the generalizability of the experimental conclusions and may limit the extrapolation of our findings to broader regions and populations. Given the high prevalence of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae Additionally, future prospective, large-scale, longitudinal, multicenter studies are essential to validate our findings and understand the causal relationships among microbial composition, immune responses, and clinical outcomes of MPP. Additionally, research on diverse populations with varying antibiotic resistance patterns is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings. The application of microbiome analysis in clinical diagnostics faces challenges such as high costs, lengthy processing times, lack of standardization, and sample handling issues. Although technological advancements are rapid, these problems still require incremental resolution through innovation and collaboration to realize the practical clinical implementation of microbiome technologies.
