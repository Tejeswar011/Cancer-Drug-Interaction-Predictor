Ferroptosis was initially described as anautophagy-independent, iron-regulated, nonapoptotic cell death.However, recent studies have revealed that autophagy is positivelyassociated with sensitivity to ferroptosis. Nonetheless, themolecular mechanisms by which these two types of regulated cell death(RCD) modulate each other remain largely unclear. Here, we screened85 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and found that overexpression ofUSP13 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 13) could significantlyupregulate NFE2L2/NRF2 (NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 2)protein levels. In addition, in 39 cases of KRAS-mutated lungadenocarcinoma (LUAD), we found that approximately 76% of USP13overexpression is positively correlated with NFE2L2 overexpression.USP13 interacts with and catalyzes the deubiquitination of thetranscription factor NFE2L2. Additionally, USP13 depletion promotesan autophagy-to-ferroptosis switch invitro Abbreviation: KEYWORDS Autophagy ferroptosis LUAD NFE2L2 SQSTM1 USP13 National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province 10.13039/501100004735 Science and Technology Innovative Research Team in Higher Educational Institutions of Hunan Province 10.13039/501100012269 Central South University 10.13039/501100002822 2023QYJC030 China Postdoctoral Science Foundation 10.13039/501100002858 Central South University 10.13039/501100002822 This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [82073099, B.
