This study examines radon concentrations in residential buildings across Khuzestan Province, Iran, exploring seasonal variations and building-related influences, to establish a baseline radon profile and inform public health strategies. A cross-sectional study measured indoor radon levels in 343 homes using CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors during the cold (December–February) and warm (June–August) seasons of 2024. Stratified random sampling ensured representativeness across Khuzestan, varying in geology and urban density. Key variables included building age, height, floor type, and structural framework. Spatial distribution was mapped via Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK).

Recent epidemiological studies conducted across the United States, Europe, and Asi have aimed to quantify the burden of radon-induced diseases, particularly lung cancer and childhood leukemia 11 13 1 12 14 15 Within Iran, several regional surveys have reported indoor radon levels that, while often below international intervention thresholds, still warrant public health attention. For example, measurements in Isfahan have shown average concentrations of 32 Bq/m 2 16 2 17 18 Various international health and regulatory organizations have issued guidelines to limit radon exposure in indoor environments. The WHO advocates for a reference level of 100 Bq/m 2 9 2 19 2 20 2 21 Recent investigations in countries such as India, Brazil, and Italy have emphasized the influence of seasonal variation, geological substrates, and construction characteristics on indoor radon levels 22 24 2 25 2 26 Khuzestan Province was selected due to its unique combination of geological diversity and public health relevance. The northern region, part of the High Zagros zone, contains uranium-rich formations (e.g., Pabdeh, Gurpi, Bakhtiari), intersected by active faults that enhance radon migration. In contrast, the southern alluvial plains offer a natural gradient for evaluating spatial variability 27 28 To bridge this gap, the present study aims to:  Quantify seasonal variations in indoor radon concentrations across residential buildings in Khuzestan Province and compare them with international reference levels. Examine the influence of structural parameters, such as building height, age, and construction materials, on indoor radon accumulation. Identify high-risk zones and generate radon concentration maps for cold and warm seasons using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK) spatial interpolation methods. Estimate the annual effective dose (AED) from indoor radon exposure across Khuzestan Province The outcomes of this research are expected to advance understanding of radon exposure in Khuzestan, inform evidence-based mitigation policies, and contribute to the broader field of environmental health risk management. Materials and methods Area of study This study adopted a cross-sectional, quantitative research design to assess indoor radon concentrations in residential buildings across Khuzestan Province, Iran (Fig. 1 29 27 28  Fig. 1 Study area. Sampling A stratified random sampling method was employed to ensure representativeness across the province’s diverse urban and geological settings. Cities were selected based on population density and geological variability, including northern mountainous areas (e.g., Dezful, Andimeshk) and southern coastal plains (e.g., Abadan, Mahshahr). Within each city, residential units were stratified by structural type (concrete vs. steel), age (< 15 years vs. >15 years), and height (ground floor vs. multi-story). A total of 343 households participated in the study. The required sample size was determined using Eq. 1  1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$n={\\left(\\frac{{Z}_{\\left(1-\\frac{\\propto\\:}{2}\\right)}\\times\\:SD}{d}\\right)}^{2}$$\\end{document} where n represents the estimated sample size, calculated based on a 99% confidence level using a Z-score of 1.96. The calculation assumes a margin of error of 0.1 µ (mean value), with SD denoting the standard deviation of the target variable 30 Data collection methods Data collection occurred in two distinct phases to capture seasonal variability. In the cold season (December 2023–February 2024), detectors were deployed for 90 days, coinciding with reduced ventilation due to closed windows and heating system use. The warm season phase (June–August 2024) followed an identical 90-day protocol, reflecting higher temperatures and natural ventilation patterns. Detectors were placed in the main living area of each home, 1–2 m above floor level and at least 50 cm from walls or ventilation sources, adhering to EPA guidelines. Placement avoided kitchens and bathrooms to minimize humidity and airflow biases. Participants were instructed to maintain typical occupancy and ventilation habits to reflect real-world conditions 31 32 Instruments and equipment Radon concentrations were determined using CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs), which are a validated passive sampling method for long-term radon evaluation 33 34 2 35 36 2 For spatial analysis, ArcGIS Pro software (Esri, USA) was employed, utilizing the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation method to visualize radon distribution 37 2 38 39 Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 27 (IBM, USA), enabling descriptive and inferential computations. Descriptive statistics outlined mean radon concentrations, ranges, and confidence intervals (95% CI). Paired t-tests evaluated seasonal differences, while independent t-tests and one-way ANOVA compared radon levels across various building characteristics (e.g., concrete vs. steel, old vs. new). The threshold for significance was established at p 40 The annual effective dose (AED) resulting from indoor radon exposure was estimated for each city during both cold and warm seasons using the standard formula recommended by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) (Eq. 2 41  2 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{E}} = {\\text{C}} \\times {\\text{F}} \\times {\\text{H}} \\times {\\text{T}} \\times {\\text{D}}$$\\end{document} where C is measured radon concentration (Bq/m 3 − 1 − 6 3 18 Results Seasonal variations in radon concentrations As illustrated in Fig. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  Fig. 2 Mean radon concentrations by city in cold and warm seasons.

Spatial distribution In this study, the spatial distribution of indoor radon concentration was modeled using two interpolation techniques: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) (Fig. 7 7 1  Table 1 Error metrics for OK and IDW (Cold and warm Seasons). Method Season RMSE Mean Standardized RMSS ASE OK Warm 32.5602 0.0119 1.0480 30.9758 OK Cold 72.9442 0.0187 0.9804 74.3599 IDW Warm 37.0547 -0.0306 1.0005 37.0374 IDW Cold 81.1994 0.0735 1.0027 80.9810 The results indicate that OK outperformed IDW in both seasons, as evidenced by lower RMSE and ASE values. The model’s standardized error metrics (Mean Standardized and RMSS) were within acceptable ranges, confirming the reliability of the OK predictions. During the cold season, both interpolation methods identified the northern regions of Khuzestan, particularly Dezful and Andimeshk, as radon concentration hotspots. The IDW method estimated the highest concentrations within the range of 263.829–266.675 Bq/mv in these areas, whereas regions such as Abadan, Khorramshahr, and Shadegan in the south recorded the lowest values, between 24.696 and 65.5 Bq/m 2 2 2  Fig. 7 Spatial distribution of radon concentration using ( A B Discussion This study comprehensively assesses indoor radon concentrations in residential buildings across Khuzestan Province, Iran, revealing significant seasonal variations and the influence of building characteristics.
