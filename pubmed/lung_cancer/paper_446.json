Current diagnostic criteria, based solely on the presence of >5% abnormal lymphocytes, fail to capture this heterogeneity, creating a critical gap in risk assessment and clinical management. This study addresses this gap by introducing the clonality analysis of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cells (Cv: clonality value) as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker. Using the highly sensitive and cost-effective Rapid Amplification of Integration Sites without Interference by Genomic DNA (RAISING)-CLOVA (a clonality quantification software) method, we quantified the clonality of HTLV-1-infected cells and evaluated its prognostic impact alongside serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels. Our findings demonstrate that patients with smoldering ATL with the monoclonal or oligoclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells are at high risk for progression to aggressive ATL, whereas those with polyclonal proliferation exhibit a more favorable prognosis. The combination of Cv and sIL-2R levels enables precise risk stratification, providing a framework for personalized, risk-adapted clinical management. Importantly, these results suggest that incorporating clonality analysis into the diagnostic criteria for smoldering ATL could refine prognostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary psychological burdens for low-risk patients, and improve therapeutic decision-making. This represents a paradigm shift in the diagnosis and management of smoldering ATL, with significant implications for patient outcomes and future treatment strategies. HTLV-1 infects at least 5-10 million people worldwide and causes two distinct diseases: ATL and HTLV-1-associated-myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). 1 2 Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is classified into four clinical subtypes according to Shimoyama’s criteria: smoldering, chronic, acute, and lymphoma types. 3-5 3-5 6 Assessing the risk of progression from smoldering to aggressive ATL is an actively evolving field. Serum sIL-2R levels ≥1,000 U/mL are associated with a higher risk of progression and increased mortality, 7 8 9 10-14 12 15 To overcome these challenges, we developed RAISING-CLOVA, a highly sensitive and cost-effective method for quantifying virus-infected cell clonality (Cv). 14 14 The present study was approved by the research ethics committees of Nagasaki University (16072504), St. Marianna University School of Medicine (1646, 2044, and 5807), and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (1382). Cv, sIL-2R levels, and PVL were successfully obtained for all peripheral blood samples analyzed in this study, with no samples excluded because of technical failure. First, we compared the distributions of Cv, sIL-2R levels, and PVL in AC (N=165), HAM/TSP (N=205), and smoldering ATL (N=125) (Online Supplementary Table S1). Figure 1C 14 Figure 1D 15 3-5 We then evaluated the utility of Cv, sIL-2R, and PVL as predictors of progression from smoldering to aggressive ATL. Progressors (N=23), who progressed to aggressive ATL during follow-up (overall period 0-167 months; average period 56.4 months) exhibited significantly higher Cv, sIL-2R, and PVL than non-progressors (N=61) ( Figure 2A Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that Cv (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.780) and sIL-2R (AUC = 0.777) were more effective than PVL (AUC = 0.717) at distinguishing progressors from non-progressors ( Figure 2B Figure 3A Figure 1. Characteristics of asymptomatic carriers, patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, and patients with smoldering adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. P P Based on this classification, we assigned patients with smoldering ATL to these four regions (Online Supplementary Table S2) Figure 3B Figure 3C 7 8 Figure 3D Despite these promising findings, two important limitations must be addressed in future investigations. First, our study excluded patients with smoldering ATL with skin or lung lesions, necessitating further research to determine the progression risk of these patient subgroups. Second, the small number of patients in the R3 category limited the strength of conclusions regarding their classification as intermediate-risk, warranting additional studies to validate this approach. In conclusion, the combination of Cv and sIL-2R as prognostic markers effectively captured the heterogeneity of smoldering ATL patients and was a highly effective predictor of progression to aggressive ATL. Moreover, our findings provide compelling evidence that integrating Cv cut-off values into diagnostic criteria enhances prognostic precision. If validated in larger cohorts and confirmed by comparing the other clonality analysis methods, such as flow cytometry and Southern blot hybridization, in the same cohort, 12 13 Figure 2.
