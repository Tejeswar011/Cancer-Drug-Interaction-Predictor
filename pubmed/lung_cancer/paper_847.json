The prevention indicator system of the German federal states (Länder in Deutschland), developed between 2018 and 2022, was therefore reviewed in relation to its relevance to climate change. Methods As a first step, a working group with members from different German federal states developed a model on the relationships between climate change and health in the context of prevention. Central aspects of this model were translated into a checklist based on guiding questions, which was used to conduct a systematic, standardised, and evidence-informed assessment of the climate relevance of the prevention indicator system of the German federal states. Results Climate change relevance was identified for a total of 49 out of 73 prevention indicators. Most frequently, climate relevance was found for indicators relating to particularly vulnerable groups to climate change-related health impacts (27 indicators), followed by 18 indicators addressing health consequences of climate change. Conclusions The assessment methodology that we developed proved suitable and can be applied to assess climate relevance in other health indicator systems. This prevention indicator system requires further development of climate aspects that have not yet been included, such as ‘health-relevant climate change impacts’, ‘health costs’, and indicators on vaccine-preventable diseases as climate adaptation measures.

Introduction The increasing impacts of climate change, such as higher average temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, or droughts, promote the emergence and spread of diseases within the population. At the same time, they increase the health risks for individuals affected by pre-existing health burdens [ 1–4 Climate change affects human health and wellbeing both directly and indirectly. Direct effects include heat-related illnesses or injuries resulting from extreme weather events [ 1 5 6 7 1 8 9 10 11 The 95th Conference of Health Ministers (Gesundheitsministerkonferenz, GMK) on June 22–23, 2022, tasked the working groups of the Association of the Highest State Health Authorities (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Obersten Landesgesundheitsbehörden, AOLG) with addressing the topic of ‘Climate Change and Health’ [ 12 Infobox 1  Key messages ► A model was developed that illustrates the relationships between climate change and health in the context of prevention, which can also be used to assess climate relevance in other health indicator systems. ► Based on this, the climate relevance of the prevention indicator system of the German federal states was determined in a standardised and transparent manner using a systematic ex-post assessment procedure with guiding questions and a checklist. ► Approximately two-thirds of the 73 indicators in the prevention indicator system of the German federal states have a climate relevance. ► Most frequently, climate relevance was found for indicators relating to particularly vulnerable population groups (27 indicators). ► 18 indicators address health consequences of climate change, nine indicators focus on climate mitigation measures, eight indicators cover causes of climate change, and three indicators concern climate adaptation measures.  Infobox 1 The diagram illustrates the structure of the Conference of Health Ministers (Gesundheitsministerkonferenz, GMK), a specialised ministerial conference attended by the health ministers or health senators of the German federal states (Länder in Deutschland), along with the subordinate working bodies [ 13  Infobox 2 The 73 indicators of the prevention indicator system are distributed across 14 thematic areas, encompassing prevention-relevant living conditions and behaviours, risks and resources, as well as morbidity and mortality. ► Thematic area 1 – Context factors (6 indicators) ► Thematic area 2 – Setting-related factors (5 indicators) ► Thematic area 3 – Psychosocial resources (7 indicators) ► Thematic area 4 – Health literacy (1 indicator) ► Thematic area 5 – Physical activity (11 indicators) ► Thematic area 6 – Nutrition (9 indicators) ► Thematic area 7 – Tobacco and alcohol (9 indicators) ► Thematic area 8 – Vaccination (3 indicators) ► Thematic area 9 – Overweight and obesity (2 indicators) ► Thematic area 10 – Diabetes (2 indicators) ► Thematic area 11 – Cardiovascular diseases (4 indicators) ► Thematic area 12 – Cancer (4 indicators) ► Thematic area 13 – Mental illnesses (8 indicators) ► Thematic area 14 – Life expectancy and premature mortality (2 indicators) A detailed overview of the prevention indicator system can be found in the final report of the UAG Prevention Indicators [ 14 Annex Table 1 The Subgroup on Prevention Indicators developed a prevention indicator system consisting of 73 indicators between 2018 and 2022 to enable coordinated and comparable prevention reporting across the German federal states ( Infobox 2 13 13 To implement the aforementioned resolution of the GMK and in response to the growing relevance of climate-related aspects concerning population health, the AG GPRS tasked the UAG Prevention Indicators with reviewing whether the prevention indicators previously developed by the UAG are relevant to climate change and, if so, to identify the specific relationships (Work Package 1). Building on this, the indicator system was to be supplemented with several key prevention indicators that are meaningful in the context of climate change (Work Package 2). This paper addresses the first work package, the ex-post assessment of the existing 73 indicators of the prevention indicator system regarding their links to climate change. The aim was to explore whether and how the already existing indicators of the prevention indicator system can be understood in relation to climate change, health, prevention, and health promotion. This must be differentiated from the narrower question of whether indicators of the prevention indicator system validly represent specific climate change aspects – this question was not the focus of the work. To our knowledge, this represents the first assessment of an existing health-related indicator system for its climate change relevance. It complements national and international initiatives and efforts to strengthen monitoring and surveillance of climate-related health aspects. At the international level, for example, the Lancet Countdown reports on the impacts of ongoing climate change on health and political responses using over 50 indicators [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 2. Methods 2.1 Conceptual preparations To address the two work packages mentioned above, the Climate Subgroup (KG Klima) was established in June 2023 under the UAG Prevention Indicators ( Infobox 1 1 2 22 1 2 5–7 11 22–33 Figure 1 2.2 Development of the Assessment Methodology The model described above served as the starting point for developing a tool to assess the climate relevance of the prevention indicators. The aim was to enable an approach that was systematic, standardised, and pragmatic in equal measure. Through a consensus process within the Climate Subgroup (KG Klima), key aspects of the developed model ( Figure 1 Table 1 32 34 35 1 5–7 23–32 11 36 37 2.3 Procedure for assessing climate relevance The 73 prevention indicators available were examined for their climate relevance using the checklist, and the assessments were agreed upon within the Subgroup Climate (KG Klima). This also included eleven so-called developmental indicators, for which operationalisation had not yet been finalised and/or suitable data sources could not be identified. During the first application of the checklist, several aspects were refined, such as the specification of the wording of the guiding questions, the evidence base to be applied, and clarification of certain terminologies. In particular, within the model component ‘Groups particularly vulnerable to climate-related health impacts’, the concept of vulnerability was defined in greater detail. Vulnerability was understood as resulting from one or more of the following aspects: exposure (e.g. to heat), susceptibility (e.g. due to pre-existing illness), and adaptive capacity (e.g. limited as a result of socioeconomic disadvantage) [ 30 3. Results Overall, a climate relevance could be identified for around two-thirds of the indicators in the prevention indicator system. These indicators are presented and explained below according to their allocation to the components of the model ‘Climate change and health in the context of prevention and health promotion’ ( Figure 1 No indicators from the prevention indicator system were assigned to the model components ‘Extent of climate change’, ‘Climate change impacts relevant to health’, ‘Health costs’ and ‘Relevant strategies/policy processes’. The prevention indicator system was not originally developed as an indicator framework specifically focused on climate and health. The indicators allocated to the individual model components below therefore do not cover the full spectrum of indicators that would be relevant for each component, but represent only those included within the prevention indicator system. 3.1 Climate relevance: Model component ‘Causes of climate change’ A link to the model component ‘Causes of climate change’ – and thus the potential for co-benefits – was identified for the following eight indicators ( Table 2 3.2 Climate relevance: Model component ‘Health impacts of climate change’ For 18 of the prevention indicators, a climate relevance in terms of ‘Health impacts of climate change’ was identified ( Table 3 3.3 Climate relevance: Model component ‘Climate mitigation measures’ This category includes nine indicators that describe health-promoting measures which also contribute to climate mitigation. Four of these indicators relate to nutritional standards in communal catering across different settings ( Table 4 3.4 Climate relevance: Model component ‘Climate adaptation measures’ Climate adaptation measures can be integrated into setting-based health promotion, and certain vaccinations may become more important in the context of climate change. Against this background, three indicators were identified as having climate relevance in terms of ‘Climate adaptation measures’ ( Table 5 3.5 Climate relevance: Model component ‘Particularly vulnerable groups’ Most of the indicators with climate relevance – a total of 27 – were assigned to the component ‘Particularly vulnerable groups’. These indicators describe groups that are especially at risk of adverse health impacts of climate change due to socioeconomic or health-related factors. The following table is therefore subdivided accordingly ( Table 6 Table 6 4. Discussion At the federal state level, the Prevention Indicators Subgroup, which is part of the AOLG Working Group on Health Reporting and Prevention (AG GPRS), examined the extent to which the indicators contained in the federal states’ prevention indicator system are linked to climate change. To develop an assessment procedure, a model was first created, drawing on current national and international analyses of the interrelations between climate change and health. From this model, guiding questions were derived and transferred into a checklist in order to enable allocation to aspects of climate change and to systematically assess the climate relevance of the indicators. As a result of the assessment, 49 of the 73 prevention indicators were found to have a climate relevance: 27 indicators capture population groups whose health is particularly at risk from the impacts of climate change and were therefore assigned to the model component ‘Particularly vulnerable groups’. Eighteen indicators were linked to the component ‘Health impacts of climate change’, nine to ‘Climate mitigation measures’, eight to ‘Causes of climate change’, and three to ‘Climate adaptation measures’. The eight indicators related to the causes of climate change are of particular importance, as measures that positively influence these causes can bring benefits both for climate mitigation and for population health. Although climate change was not explicitly taken into account in the development of the indicator system, around two-thirds of all indicators in the prevention indicator system show a climate relevance. This underlines the need to strengthen consideration of climate change as a cross-cutting issue in relation to population health. 4.1 Challenges in the assessment Answering the guiding questions for evaluating the climate relevance of the prevention indicators did not always produce a clear result, as the climate relevance of an indicator may relate to several components of the underlying model ( Figure 1 Multiple allocations For certain indicators, climate relevance could be identified for more than one component of the underlying model. An example is the indicator ‘12-month prevalence of coronary heart disease’, which can be assigned both to the model component ‘Health impacts of climate change’ (increase in heart attacks and deaths from heart attacks, partly due to heat extremes, rising air pollution and chronic stress) and to the component ‘Particularly vulnerable groups’ (increased risk of climate-related health impacts among people with pre-existing coronary heart disease, for example due to thermoregulatory stress leading to increased cardiac strain, blood pressure drop and even circulatory collapse). Such multiple allocations also occurred with indicators of other disease prevalence, such as mental disorders. Other examples include the indicators ‘State programmes for health promotion in nurseries’ and ‘State programmes for health promotion in schools’, which could be assigned both to ‘Climate mitigation measures’ and ‘Climate adaptation measures’. In total, 22 indicators were allocated to more than one category. Bidirectional allocations The assessment of climate relevance also showed that indicators may capture both positive and negative impacts. This is illustrated by the indicator ‘Degree of urbanisation’: a high degree of urbanisation can be associated with extensive land sealing and the related negative effects on the local climate. At the same time, however, a high level of urbanisation through densification within cities may also help prevent urban sprawl into surrounding areas, which – especially if combined with climate-friendly solutions for infill development – can have positive effects on climate-related factors. Based on the definition of this indicator, which does not cover qualitative aspects of urbanisation or knock-on effects in surrounding areas, a clear determination of the direction of its climate relevance is not possible, but also not required for the purposes of this analysis. Importance of the definition and operationalisation of indicators for their climate assessment During the assessment process it became clear that the exact definition and operationalisation of an indicator – that is, the measure applied – are crucial for the evaluation outcome. This can be seen, for example, in the indicator ‘Fruit and vegetable consumption’. The indicator is defined as the ‘proportion of the population with daily fruit and/or vegetable intake’ and is based on survey data on the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption. The indicator is associated with healthy dietary habits and was therefore included in the prevention indicator set. At the same time, it could also be linked to a diet lower in meat and more climate-friendly. However, based on the reported frequency of fruit and vegetable intake alone, it cannot be inferred that people are necessarily consuming a low-meat diet, nor that their fruit and vegetable consumption is climate-friendly – such as by preferring local, seasonal, organically grown, or unpackaged products. Studies highlight the complex links between production methods and climate impact [ 82–84 A special status is accorded to the development indicators of the prevention indicator system ( Annex Table 1 4.2 Strengths and Limitations The checklist has proven to be a suitable tool for assessing climate relevance. Based on this framework, all 73 indicators of the German federal states’ prevention indicator system could be evaluated. The systematic, standardised, and evidence-informed approach has proven practical, and an additional valuable application of the prevention indicator system could be identified. Nevertheless, regarding the methodology of the evaluation process, it should be noted that no systematic literature review could be conducted on the diverse climate relevance aspects for the 73 indicators under review. Associated biases cannot be ruled out. Decisions on climate relevance were made based on the available literature through a multi-step consensus process among members of the Climate Subgroup. Given the complexity of the topic of climate change and health, it quickly became evident that scaling the assessment results would unnecessarily complicate the process without contributing to understanding. However, even the dichotomous evaluation of climate relevance only reflects the literature that was reviewed and should therefore be regarded as a snapshot. New scientific findings related to climate change and climate adaptation may alter these assessments in the future. It is also important to emphasise that the federal states’ prevention indicators were not developed with the primary aim of capturing climate change and health, but rather according to other criteria, such as general public health relevance and the amenability to intervention [ 14 4.3 Conclusion and Outlook The Climate Subgroup of the UAG Prevention Indicators has completed the review of the existing prevention indicator system with regard to its climate relevance (Work Package 1). An integrative approach of this kind, which systematically relates the analysis of the health aspects of climate change to a prevention indicator system, has not previously been pursued. The comprehensive evaluation of the indicators and the associated discussions have shown that the definitions of the existing prevention indicators are not always clearly designed to assess potential climate relevance, and specific gaps in the prevention indicator system have become apparent. While various components of the model are represented, certain areas – for example, vaccine-preventable infectious diseases linked to climate change – are currently insufficiently covered. Furthermore, although mental health is represented by numerous indicators, existing indicators do not specifically address mental health burdens associated with climate change or climate adaptation. No indicators could be identified within the model components ‘Extent/Aspects of Climate Change’, ‘Climate Change Impacts with Health Relevance’, or ‘Health Costs’ in the prevention indicator system. This highlights a further need for specific indicators that both demonstrate prevention potential and clearly reflect climate relevance, particularly for indicators that exhibit co-benefits. In a next step, new prevention indicators are to be developed to cover relevant climate change-related health aspects and to address identified gaps in the prevention indicator system with respect to the model components on climate change (Work Package 2). Ideas for this have already been collected during the completed evaluation process. Additionally, existing indicators from other national and international indicator systems, such as those from the Lancet Countdown, are to be considered [ 15 20 19 Acknowledgement The German article was translated into English using DeepL Pro and ChatGPT.

At the same time, depending on infrastructure measures, it can also contribute to efficient resource use with regard to buildings, water and energy [ 38 39 Recreational space 2 Recreational areas (including sports grounds, parks and campsites) and cemeteries are largely green, less sealed surfaces. They can absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Vegetation in recreational areas helps regulate temperature by providing shade and lowering ambient temperature through evaporative cooling. In addition, they improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and producing oxygen [ 40 Walkability Car-oriented urban infrastructure significantly contributes to climate change. Measures to improve walkability and cycling friendliness contribute both to climate mitigation and to the promotion of physical activity and health [ 41–43 Cycling friendliness/cycling infrastructure Transport-related physical activity Mode share Breastfeeding Formula feeding requires energy and resources for production, transport and preparation, and generates packaging waste. By contrast, breastfeeding is a climate-friendly and sustainable form of infant nutrition. Low breastfeeding rates contribute to climate change [ 44–46 Tobacco consumption High levels of tobacco consumption require increased tobacco production, which affects agricultural land use, deforestation, and subsequently greenhouse gas emissions. Another factor with high levels of tobacco use is the energy-intensive production of packaging materials [ 47 Table 3: Indicators with climate relevance ‘Health impacts of climate change’ Indicator Climate relevance Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy Extreme weather events, increased impacts of air pollution, and the spread of climate-related diseases may reduce life expectancy [ 48 1 27 30 27 30 Premature mortality Breast cancer mortality in women Increased mortality among seriously ill patients at regional level can be triggered by extreme weather events that severely disrupt regional infrastructure or health services, leading for example to delayed operations and interrupted chemotherapy. People with cancer are among the groups most dependent on a functioning healthcare infrastructure [ 49 50 Self-rated health-related quality of life Self-rated quality of life, psychological distress, and chronic stress are influenced by changing climatic conditions. In particular, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods and storms place considerable strain on psychosocial wellbeing. Studies show that chronic stress reactions, up to and including clinically relevant mental disorders, are increasing as a result of climate change [ 7 29 Self-rated psychological distress Self-rated stress/chronic stress Mental health problems in children and adolescents Mental disorders can arise or be worsened as a result of climate change. Studies show a significant increase in post-traumatic and/or depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, suicide attempts, and substance misuse, particularly following extreme weather events [ 29 33 29 51 52 53 29 54 Sleep disorders Depressive symptoms Outpatient diagnoses of mental disorders Work incapacity due to mental disorders Rehabilitation due to mental disorders Early retirement due to mental disorders Suicides 12-month prevalence of hypertension Cardiovascular diseases are influenced by climate change. Studies show increasing morbidity and mortality – particularly for heart attacks and strokes. This rise is attributable both to direct effects, such as heat exposure and air pollution, and to indirect mechanisms, such as chronic stress reactions [ 7 55 56 12-month prevalence of coronary heart disease 12-month prevalence of stroke Hospital morbidity: myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and stroke Table 4: Indicators with climate relevance ‘Climate mitigation measures’ Indicator Climate relevance Certified breastfeeding promotion in maternity clinics Certified breastfeeding promotion can increase breastfeeding rates and duration. This, in turn, reduces the use of formula milk. The resulting avoidance of CO 2 46 57 Breastfeeding Tobacco tax Higher tobacco taxation can reduce tobacco consumption, leading to a decrease in CO 2 58 Implementation of nutritional standards in nurseries, schools, workplace canteens, and residential care for seniors Implementation of DGE standards in communal catering incorporates sustainability, seasonality, and regionality [ 59–62 2 63 64 65 State programmes for health promotion in nurseries State programmes for health promotion in nurseries and schools can foster education and awareness of climate-friendly behaviours, for example by imparting knowledge on sustainable nutrition or environmentally friendly mobility [ 65 State programmes for health promotion in schools Table 5: Indicators with climate relevance ‘Climate adaptation measures’ Indicator Climate relevance State programmes for health promotion in nurseries State-level health promotion programmes have considerable potential for integrating climate adaptation measures into nursery and school settings, and some of this is already evident in existing programmes [ 66–71 State programmes for health promotion in schools Vaccination coverage at school entry examination for STIKO-recommended vaccinations Among the vaccinations recommended by STIKO for infants and children [ 72 24 73 Table 6: Indicators with climate relevance ‘Particularly vulnerable groups’  A) Particularly vulnerable groups due to socioeconomic factors  Indicator  Climate relevanc Single-parent families Single parents, unemployed persons and persons with a low formal education belong to high-risk groups for poverty. People with limited socioeconomic and educational resources – and therefore reduced adaptive capacity – may be more exposed to pollutants and heat due to poor housing conditions. In single-parent and low-income families, infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to climate-related health impacts because of their heightened sensitivity to heat [ 30 Children and adolescents under 15 years in households receiving SGB II (Social Code II) benefits School leavers without a final qualification Unemployment rate Child poverty risk rate Socioeconomic deprivation Climate change is expected to exacerbate social and health inequalities [ 74 30  B) Climate relevance: Particularly vulnerable groups due to health-related factors  Indicator  Climate relevance Tobacco consumption Smoking increases the risk of respiratory and other chronic conditions, which may worsen during heatwaves or as a result of climate-related air pollution [ 27 Body Mass Index (BMI) in adults Obesity, due to a relatively low body surface-to-mass ratio, reduces heat dissipation because less fluid is emitted through sweating. It may also impair heat perception. In children, thermoregulation is not yet fully developed, making the negative effects of higher body weight more pronounced [ 27 30 65 Body Mass Index (BMI) in children Incidence of diabetes Diabetes mellitus impairs skin blood circulation, reducing the effectiveness of sweating. This can lead to quicker overheating as well as blood sugar fluctuations with risk of hypo- or hyperglycaemia. Diabetes is also associated with impaired thermoregulatory lung responses. During heatwaves, the risk of hospitalisation increases [ 75 Prevalence of diabetes 12-month prevalence of hypertension Heat dilates blood vessels, lowering blood pressure. In combination with antihypertensive medication (e.g. diuretics), this may cause fainting (syncope), falls, or impaired organ perfusion leading to heart attacks [ 27 12-month prevalence of coronary heart disease Extreme or prolonged heat causes thermoregulatory stress, leading to drops in blood pressure, increased cardiac strain, circulatory collapse or heatstroke [ 27 76 77 12-month prevalence of stroke Hospital morbidity: myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and stroke Incidence of colorectal cancer A cancer diagnosis has wide-ranging psychological and often socioeconomic consequences. As the disease progresses, many patients experience marked physical weakness. People with cancer are therefore particularly vulnerable to extreme heat [ 78 Incidence of cervical cancer Incidence of lung cancer Nicotine-/tobacco-attributable diagnoses in hospital care Some tobacco-related conditions requiring hospital treatment are linked to increased vulnerability to heat and other climate-related impacts [ 27 Mental health problems in children and adolescents Children are especially vulnerable to the psychological impacts of climate change, for instance during extreme weather events such as floods. Girls are a particular at-risk group, with evidence showing increased likelihood of anxiety disorders and substance misuse after experiencing natural disasters [ 53 Sleep disorders Chronic stress burdens, including sleep disturbances, can heighten vulnerability to heat and other climate-related impacts [ 27 33 79–81 Self-rated psychological distress Self-rated stress/chronic stress Depressive Symptoms Outpatient diagnoses of mental disorders Rehabilitation due to mental disorders Early retirement due to mental disorders ",
