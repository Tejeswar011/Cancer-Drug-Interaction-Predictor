The cellular characteristics of DF remain elusive. Herein, we performed single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) to reveal the cell landscape of DF. To uncover the exclusive characteristics of DF, we compared the transcriptional profile of DF with that of keloid fibroblast (KF) and normal fibroblast (NF) in the public data ( GSE163973 + + + Mesenchymal fibroblasts were significantly expanded in desmoid fibromatosis (DF), and the mesenchymal fibroblasts in DF were further divided into two subtypes according to the differentiation states. ADAM12 and CREB3L1 were identified as the specific marker and transcription factor for DF.

Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) is a powerful tool to unveil the cellular heterogeneity in the complicated tumor ecosystems and enable to understand the tumor's biological characteristics from the single‐cell perspective [ 17 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 The Tumor Specimens To resolve the cell composition of DF, we harvested the samples from girls aged 7 and 9 for scRNA‐seq. DF was diagnosed by tumor histopathology. Both lesions were at the upper arm and thigh, and the imaging features are shown in Figure S1 GSE163973 18 19 S1 S2 2.2 Single‐Cell Solution Preparation The dissected tumors were immediately stored in the tissue storage solution (Miltenyi Biotec, 130‐100‐008) on ice before cell separation, then washed with cold DPBS to remove the visible blood. The specimens were cut into pieces for further digestion with the tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130‐095‐929) under gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, 130‐093‐235) following the kit instructions for tough tumors. When the tissue pieces had become entirely disintegrated, the enzymolysis was terminated by the supplement of DMEM containing 10% FBS (Gibco, 12664025). Subsequently, the digested cells were filtered through the 70 μm nylon cell strainers (Miltenyi Biotec, 130‐098‐462), and centrifuged at 350 g 2.3 Bioinformatics Analyses The detailed protocols of scRNA‐seq bioinformatics analyses can be found in Appendix S1 2.4 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Staining Paraffin‐embedded sections were sequentially subjected to xylene dewaxing and ethanol gradient hydration, followed by heat‐mediated antigen retrieval and endogenous peroxidase quenching with 3% H 2 2 2 2.5 Multiplex Immunofluorescence Staining Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was conducted using a tyramide signal amplification kit (Panovue, 10079100020). Sections underwent the same preprocessing steps as previously described in IHC procedures, omitting peroxidase inactivation. The experimental workflow comprised three iterative staining cycles per specimen, each involving: the section underwent antigen retrieval and antigen blocking, and were incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies including LAMP5, SULF1, THBS4, SFRP4, ADAM12, CREB3L1, S100B, COL11A1, and MKI67, and then reacted with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and tyramide‐fluorophore conjugation (Alexa Fluor 520/570/650; 15 min at room temperature) for spectral differentiation. Post‐sequential staining, nuclear counterstaining was achieved with DAPI (15 min at room temperature). Finally, the multispectral images were captured under a confocal microscope (LEICA, TCS SP8). 2.6 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.0.5; Bell Laboratories). Chi‐square test was applied to evaluate the differences of categorical data between DF and NF groups. Wilcoxon signed‐rank test was employed to compare the patient age, scRNA‐seq data, IHC protein expressions, and immunofluorescence positive cell counts between the two groups. The correlation between CREB3L1 and ADAM12 was analyzed using Spearman test. Differences were considered significant when p 3 Results 3.1 Resolving the Single‐Cell Landscape of the Whole Cell Populations To resolve the cellular composition, the samples were collected from two patients with DF and underwent 10× genomic single‐cell sequencing and further immunohistochemistry validation (Figure 1A GSE163973 S3 1B 1C 1D 1E FIGURE 1 The cellular picture of desmoid fibromatosis (DF), keloid fibroblast (KF), and normal fibroblast (NF). (A) The schematic workflow of this study. Created with BioRender.com Overall, these results depicted an unbiased single‐cell picture for DF, and the identified cell markers can potentially be utilized for cell discriminations in DF. 3.2 Dissecting the Heterogeneity of Fibroblasts in DF According to the definition of four subpopulations in human dermis fibroblasts [ 18 20 2A 2B 2C 2D,E FIGURE 2 Dissecting the heterogeneity of fibroblasts in desmoid fibromatosis (DF), keloid fibroblast (KF), and normal fibroblast (NF).

(C) Heatmap visualizing the scaled expressions of top 5 genes in each fibroblast subtype. (D) GO enrichment results of each cell subtype in fibroblasts. (E) GSEA analysis illustrating the activated and suppressed pathways in mesenchymal fibroblasts versus other fibroblasts. Altogether, the mesenchymal fibroblasts were significantly expanded in DF, were linked to the collagen synthesis, and may play the dominant pathologic role in DF. 3.3 Differentiation Trajectory of Fibroblasts in DF Monocle 2 was adopted to delineate the differentiation trajectory of fibroblasts in DF, KF, and NF. A total of three differentiation states were identified (Figure 3A 3B 3C 3D FIGURE 3 The pseudotime analysis of fibroblasts in desmoid fibromatosis (DF), keloid fibroblast (KF), and normal fibroblast (NF). (A) The distribution of different states in the fibroblast differentiation trajectory. (B) The pseudotime trajectory of all fibroblasts. (C) The distribution of cell subtypes in the fibroblast differentiation trajectory. (D) The distribution of different groups in the fibroblast differentiation trajectory. Taken together, the mesenchymal fibroblasts in DF were terminally differentiated cells, whereas the other subtypes of fibroblasts in KF and NF were early differentiated cells. These findings revealed the most striking difference between DF and controls. 3.4 Subdivision of Mesenchymal Fibroblasts With the Diverse Differentiation States UMAP plot projected three differentiation states in all fibroblasts (Figure 4A 4B 4C 4D 4E 4F S2 4G,H FIGURE 4 Mesenchymal fibroblasts were composed of two differentiation states.

(H) Statistical analysis of LAMP5, SULF1, SFRP4, and THBS4 IHC expressions in 22 DF and 42 NF patients. Altogether, mesenchymal fibroblasts in DF were divided into two differentiation states, among which fibroblasts with state 3 that played significant roles in collagen deposition and ossification may be the major component of DF. 3.5 Identification of Specific Marker and Transcription Factor for DF To screen out the specific markers in DF, the upregulated genes (log 2 5A 5B 5C–E S3 S4 5F 5G 5H 5I,J 5K 5L S5 S6 5L S5 S6 FIGURE 5 Identification of specific marker and transcription factor for desmoid fibromatosis (DF).

(L) Immunofluorescence of fibroblast common (ADAM12, CREB3L1) and subtype markers (LAMP5, SULF1, SFRP4, THBS4) in DF. Overall, ADAM12 and CREB3L1 were determined to be the specific markers and TFs for DF, respectively. The specific markers and TFs may provide novel targets for the diagnosis and treatment strategies of DF. 3.6 The Significance of COL11A1 + Cellchat analysis indicated that the number and strength of neural cells and other cell interactions were significantly increased in DF when compared with those in KF and NF (Figure 6A,B 6C,D 6E,F 6G FIGURE 6 The significance of neural cells in the cellular microenvironment of desmoid fibromatosis (DF).

Altogether, COL11A1 + 3.7 Expanding of Proliferative Fibroblasts and Neural Cells in DF UMAP plot identified eight cell subtypes in the mixed cycling populations (Figure 7A 7B 7C 7D + 7E 7F 7G + 7H,I S7 FIGURE 7 The proliferating cells were expanded in desmoid fibromatosis (DF).

(G) Differentially expressed genes of the three groups in cycling cells. (H) Immunofluorescence of S100B + + + + + + Taken together, the proliferative neural cells and fibroblasts were expanded in DF, which can account for the higher probability of tumor recurrence in DF. Similar to the function of nonproliferative neural cells and fibroblasts, proliferative neural cells and fibroblasts also contribute to the profibrotic microenvironment in DF. 4 Discussion DF can arise on a scar [ 21 22 23 18 20 23 24 Cell differentiation states clearly discriminated DF from the controls. DF was composed of fibroblasts with state 2 and 3, while fibroblasts with state 1 were the dominant component for KF and NF. Cell function analysis further suggested that fibroblasts with state 3 were distinct from those with state 1, and state 2 seemed to be the transition status between state 1 and 3. DF samples were made of different ratios of fibroblasts with state 2 and 3. Given the enriched ossification pathway for fibroblasts with state 3, the higher percentage of fibroblasts with state 3 in tumors can explain the hard property of DF. A previous study revealed that LAMP5 was a specific marker of TGFB1 positive cancer‐associated myofibroblasts [ 25 26 27 Our comprehensive analysis determined ADAM12 was a specific marker for DF. ADAM12 has been reported to be upregulated and correlated with tumor activity in DF [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Tumor microenvironment analysis indicated that neural and cycling cells played significant roles in maintaining the fibrotic niche for DF. We found the COL11A1 + 35 36 + + + There were two limitations that should be pointed out in this study. First, the sample size for scRNA‐seq is limited, and more samples are needed for the generalizability of the findings, although the expanded samples were enrolled for validation. Second, this is an observational study, and further mechanism experiments are required to clarify the pathogenesis of DF. In summary (Figure 8 + + FIGURE 8 The graphical abstracts of this study.
