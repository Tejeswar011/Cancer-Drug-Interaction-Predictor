These cells can rapidly proliferate, giving rise to tumor recurrence in more aggressive and drug-resistant forms. As photodynamic therapy (PDT) has advanced, it has emerged as an option to treat this brain tumor. The oncological basis of PDT involves the selective accumulation of a photosensitizer (PS) in the tumor, followed by its activation with electromagnetic radiation to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce tumor cell death. Given that first- and second-generation PSs present significant limitations, including poor tumor selectivity, suboptimal biodistribution, limited absorption within the therapeutic window, and slow systemic clearance, research has progressed toward the development of third-generation PSs based on nanotechnology to optimize their therapeutic properties. This review addresses the types of tumor cell death induced by PDT, as well as the advancements of PS design, focusing on titanium dioxide (TiO 2 glioblastoma photodynamic therapy photosensitizers nanoparticles titanium dioxide zinc oxide Ciencia de Frontera CBF-2023-2024-1982 CF-2023-G-971 This research was funded by Ciencia de Frontera with the grant numbers CBF-2023-2024-1982 and CF-2023-G-971. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), with glioblastoma (GB) (WHO grade IV) accounting for approximately 50% of all malignant CNS tumors [ 1 2 3 1 Chemotherapy is known to be associated with systemic side effects. Radiotherapy, on the other hand, is limited by the combined radiation dose. As a result, research has focused on developing alternative therapeutic approaches that are more specific and selective, safe, effective, and economical. One such approach is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is a modern, non-invasive, and rapid method for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, including cancer, bacterial infections, psoriasis, and atherosclerosis, among others [ 4 5 6 7 6 7 8 A crucial determinant of successful PDT is the selection of PSs with optimal physicochemical and photobiological properties, specifically the ability to be activated by light within the optimal therapeutic window (600–800 nm), where tissue penetration into the tumor is maximized and phototoxicity to surrounding healthy tissue is minimized. In the neuro-oncological setting, the blood–brain barrier, tumor heterogeneity, and other factors present additional challenges for conventional PSs within precision medicine frameworks. These difficulties have prompted exploration of alternative strategies. To specifically target the site of the tumor, a light-generating agent would need to be placed. This approach is still at an early stage, but has been explored in other cancer types through the use of self-luminescent nanosystems [ 9 10 2 2. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) Basically, PDT depends on three main components: (1) radiation (600–1000 nm), (2) a photosensitizer (PS), and (3) oxygen in its molecular state (O 2 11 12 13 14 0 1 1 3 15 16 3 3 2 Figure 1 2.1. Type I Reactions in PDT This reaction occurs when the PS 3 17 2 2 − − 2 2 − 18 2 2 2 − − 19 PS 0 1 3 (1) PS 3 3− + (2) PS 3− 2 2− (3) ST + 2 − 2 2 (4) 2.2. Type II Reactions in PDT In type II reactions, PS 3 2 1 2 20 21 PS 3 2 0 1 2 (5) 1 2 (6) Type I and type II reactions can coexist, and their contribution to the final PDT efficiency depends on factors such as the type of PS, oxygen O 2 22 Some reports of a type III reaction have been found, and it has been suggested that it occurs alongside types I and II [ 17 3 2.3. Types of PDT-Induced Cell Death During the development of PDT, ROS such as H 2 2 − 2− Figure 1 23 2.3.1. Apoptosis Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that generally occurs in tumor cells in response to PDT treatment through several signaling pathways involving caspases, members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, and apoptosis-inducing factors. However, in cases of PDT-induced cancer cell death events where the apoptotic pathway is not available (i.e., conditions where low levels of ATP are present in the cell), PDT may cause cancer cell death by inducing either the process of autophagy or necrosis [ 13 21 2.3.2. Autophagy Autophagy, a form of programmed cell death, has the potential to either contribute to resistance to cancer treatments by suppressing cell death and allowing the cell to recover, or to promote susceptibility by facilitating the process of death [ 24 PDT-induced necrotic cell death is a form of cell degeneration that is not scheduled. It affects large parts of cell populations. The key characteristics of this condition are cytoplasmic swelling, organelle destruction, and plasma membrane disruption. These factors ultimately lead to the release of intracellular contents and subsequent disintegration of cancer cells [ 13 2.3.3. Necroptosis Necroptosis is a programmed form of cell death that is morphologically similar to necrosis. During this process, cells and their organelles undergo chromatin condensation and cell membrane rupture, releasing cellular contents into the extracellular space [ 25 26 27 28 2.3.4. Pyroptosis Pyroptosis, a caspase-independent form of cell death, is characterized by cellular swelling and the appearance of numerous protrusions on the cell membrane prior to rupture [ 29 30 31 32 33 2.3.5. Ferroptosis Ferroptosis is iron-dependent and induced by the generation of ROS and lipid peroxides during PDT [ 34 2 2 2 − 35 24 35 36 35 37 2.3.6. Cuproptosis Cuproptosis is a recently identified copper-dependent cell death mechanism associated with the accumulation of copper in cells [ 38 39 38 39 2.3.7. Paraptosis Paraptosis is a recently described form of programmed cell death that is characterized by swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and vacuolization of the cytoplasm. In contrast to the process of apoptosis, paraptosis does not require the activation of caspases or DNA fragmentation [ 29 40 41 42 2+ 41 43 44 40 45 2.3.8. Parthanatos Parthanatos is another form of programmed cell death. This process is distinguished by the excessive activation of the DNA damage response pathway, with a particular emphasis on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and its independence from the conventional cell death pathway involving caspases [ 46 47 48 49 All mechanisms of PDT-induced cell death described above are highly dependent on several factors, including cell genotype, type of PS used, subcellular localization of PS, light dose used, and oxygen availability. PDT can be applied locally to a specific region of the tumor by selectively illuminating the lesion without affecting normal tissue. PDT is therefore a more favorable option than radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which are known to be toxic. Over the past 40 years, PDT has been successfully used to treat skin cancer, Barrett’s esophagus, head and neck malignancies, lung cancer, and bladder cancer [ 13 50 3. Photosensitizers (PSs) for PDT The principal challenges inherent in the clinical approach to GB are undoubtedly associated with its diffusely infiltrative capacity. This capacity hinders the development of therapeutic agents capable of penetrating the BBB, and comes with the risk associated with tumor resection [ 51 52 53 54 55 PSs are a key and important component of PDT. An ideal PS should be a chemically pure compound and easy to synthesize, have a homogeneous composition, efficiently generate ROS, selectively accumulate in target tissue, be harmless in the absence of radiation, absorb light in the long wavelength of the spectrum (600–850 nm, a range called the “phototherapeutic window”), be stable in solution, serum, or plasma, be easily eliminated from the body, and be economical to produce [ 56 57 57 58 59 Figure 2 3.1. First-Generation Photosensitizers in PDT for GB The first generation of PSs includes hematoporphyrin, photofrin (II) porphyrins, and their derivatives (Fotosan, Fotocan, and Fotofrin), ( Figure 2 7 Their application to brain tumors was first demonstrated by Diamond et al. in 1972, who showed that the administration of hematoporphyrin followed by phototherapy had lethal effects on glioma cells in culture [ 60 60 Subsequently, Perria et al. used an i.v.-injected hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD) as a sensitizing drug for the treatment of gliomas. The photodynamic process was initiated using a HeNe laser (632.8 nm). Following the surgical excision of the glioma, the residual tumor bed was exposed to the action of the laser, thus inducing necrosis of the remaining neoplastic cells [ 61 Following the initial report by Perria, from 1980 to 1990, a number of groups from Italy [ 61 62 63 64 65 In 1988, a phase I/II trial was conducted, involving 20 patients who were treated 25 times with PDT using a hematoporphyrin derivative and light at 630 nm (40–120 J/cm 2 66 67 In 2006, Muller conducted a randomized controlled trial of Photofrin ® 68 The initial research on photodynamic therapy has demonstrated encouraging outcomes in the management of gliomas. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the occurrence of non-specific accumulation of photosynthesizers in normal brain tissue. This may increase the risk of adverse effects, potentially disguising its safety and effectiveness [ 51 69 70 43 71 3.2. Second-Generation Photosensitizers in PDT for GB Second-generation PSs undoubtedly have better advantages than first-generation PSs, including 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and its esters, sodium taloporfin (LS11), benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD), temoporfin (mTHPC, Foscan), tin etiopururin (SnET2), and lutetium texaphyrin. Their higher purity, more efficient ROS production, and greater tumor selectivity mean that adverse effects are limited [ 51 70 72 Figure 2 57 59 This second generation of PSs has been shown to possess phototoxic properties at longer wavelengths (600–800 nm). Furthermore, due to their excitation at lower energies (up to 20 J/cm 2 51 73 74 3.3. 5-ALA 5-ALA is an amino acid analogue and is the most commonly used second-generation PS for the treatment of malignant gliomas, including GB. Despite the fact that it is not an intrinsically fluorescent molecule, it is the precursor of the photosensitizing compound protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). It has been established that the process of PpIX generation in cells occurs through the heme biosynthetic pathway [ 54 75 76 It has been established that 5-ALA itself is a valuable tool for two main areas within the management of malignant gliomas. First, it is used for intraoperative real-time visualization (fluorescence-guided surgery) during surgical excision. Second, it contributes to improving treatment outcomes [ 74 77 78 79 80 81 82 82 82 At present, 5-ALA (also known as Gliolan©) has received FDA approval and is extensively utilized in the imaging of neoplastic tissue, including GB [ 83 3.4. Talaporfin (LS11, MACE, NPe6) Thalaporfin is a chlorine derivative with a light absorption range in the 664 nm. The use of this agent has been demonstrated in patients with parenchymal changes in malignant brain tumors, with evidence of both effective and safe results in the management of these patients [ 84 26 85 86 87 2 88 3.5. Phthalocyanines Phthalocyanines constitute another group of second-generation PSs employed in PDT. The absorption spectra of these materials extend from 650 to 850 nm. It has been demonstrated that the utilization of phthalocyanines as PSs in PDT has the capacity to induce cell death, as evidenced by several cell models (T98G, MO59, LN229, C6, and U87-MG) [ 89 90 91 92 The main disadvantage of second-generation PSs is their low water solubility. This property causes second-generation PSs to aggregate under physiological conditions, reducing the yield of ROS production. Their hydrophobic nature also limits their suitability for intravenous administration [ 93 94 3.6. Nanotechnology-Based Third-Generation Photosensitizers in PDT for GB Third-generation PSs are currently under development, with a focus on synthesizing structures with a higher affinity and specificity, resulting in improved cellular internalization for target cells [ 6 7 23 58 59 95 96 97 As a scientific field of recent creation, nanotechnology is emerging as an alternative to improve the delivery, performance, and safety of current PSs and to overcome some of the challenges of PDT applied to cancer [ 98 99 100 101 102 100 101 103 104 105 106 107 108 106 Combining photosensitizers with nanomaterials can improve the efficacy of photodynamic therapy and eliminate its side effects. Using nanoparticles enables a targeted approach focusing on specific receptors and increasing the selectivity of photodynamic therapy [ 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 Nanomaterials used in photodynamic therapy consist of numerous structures constructed from organic and inorganic materials ( Figure 3 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 A significant benefit of utilizing NPs is their capacity to safeguard PSs from premature degradation, thereby extending their stability and facilitating their accumulation within tumor tissue [ 72 124 125 126 The use of NPs loaded with a photosensitizer (AlClPc) was used for photodynamic therapy of GB. The results demonstrated elevated levels of ROS production, accompanied by a decline in the viability and proliferation of tumor cells within a murine model. The authors observed a significant decrease in the total tumor area and no evidence of systemic toxicity [ 127 128 4. TiO 2 2 In the recent literature, the employment of TiO 2 117 129 2 130 131 4.1. TiO 2 TiO 2 132 133 2 Figure 4 134 2 135 Titania possesses relevant properties, including low cost, availability, and chemical stability, high photostability and photocatalytic activity, and excellent biocompatibility [ 136 137 2 Figure 4 2 136 137 2 138 136 139 2 140 141 142 143 144 145 2 2 2 146 147 148 149 2 150 2 150 151 Toxicity of TiO 2 The primary objective of employing TiO 2 152 2 153 Several studies have suggested that TiO 2 154 155 156 As demonstrated by several researchers, the concentration and size of TiO 2 2 157 158 159 Regarding the CNS, research has demonstrated that the capacity of TiO 2 2 153 160 161 2 155 162 163 2 Furthermore, the neurotoxic damage of TiO 2 164 165 4.2. ZnO ZnO is an n-type semiconductor with a wide bandgap energy (Eg) of 3.37 eV. This is due to its chemical structure, which contains a large number of intrinsic defects, such as zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancies [ 166 Figure 5 167 Figure 5 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 − 2 − 1 2 2 2 53 Figure 5 ZnO-based nanomaterials have also been investigated as PSs in PDT due to their high surface-to-volume ratio [ 175 176 177 178 179 Like TiO 2 175 2 175 Toxicity of ZnONPs Similar to TiO 2 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 In a study conducted on human melanocytes, the cytotoxic potential of ZnONPs and TiO 2 188 189 190 The cytotoxic effects of ZnONP accumulation are highly relevant. The literature indicates that exposure to this type of NP results in the distribution of Zn in the kidneys, liver, and lungs. However, over time, the concentration of Zn in these organs decreases, while it increases in the brain [ 191 192 118 193 194 195 Other mechanisms include brain oxidative stress due to a deregulation in the activity of the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes, promoting neuroinflammation [ 196 183 197 198 199 4.3. Protein Corona in TiO 2 Nanomaterials (NMs), such as TiO 2 200 201 A study was conducted to characterize the formation of PCs on TiO 2 202 Poulsen et al. used proteomic results to ascertain that a unique protein corona is formed on the surface of TiO 2 2 203 The formation of PCs on ZnONPs when in contact with biological fluids has also interestingly been studied. Bhunia, A. K. et al. studied the interaction between ZnONPs and human hemoglobin (Hb). The Hb formed a “hard corona” on the surface of the ZnONPs in a very short time, and the unfolding of Hb occurred over a long time. The ZnO NPs were completely covered by Hb with a shell thickness of 6 nm. Tryptophans and heme–porphyrin moieties of Hb were the major binding sites for ZnONPs. Electrostatic interaction, along with the hydrophobic interaction between ZnO NPs and Hb, is responsible for the conformational change in Hb due to the increase in the percentage of beta-sheets, together with a decrease in alpha-helices [ 204 It has been demonstrated in further studies that protein-coated ZnONPs in serum-containing media exhibit reduced levels of toxicity and an augmented release of extracellular ions in comparison with the same particles that have been incubated in serum-free media [ 205 5. Cancer Therapy Using Nanomaterials Since the 1980s, cancer treatment has evolved significantly. We have moved away from broad-spectrum cytotoxic chemotherapeutics towards the development of targeted therapies and the inhibition of specific cancer pathways [ 206 Active delivery strategies have been shown to enhance the intracellular concentration of therapeutic agents in cancer cells, while sparing normal cells from cytotoxic effects [ 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 TiO 2 The photochemical properties of TiO 2 2 The potential of TiO 2 215 216 217 Figure 6 Figure 6 In 2014, Zhang et al. conducted a comparative analysis of TiO 2 131 A key challenge in implementing TiO 2 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 K d α β γ 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 Figure 6 232 233 In this sense, Uribe-Robles et al. synthesized hollow TiO 2 2 2 150 2 2 2 234 6. Conclusions In recent decades, there has been an accumulation of knowledge regarding the function and use of PDT, as well as its application in the treatment of malignant brain tumors, such as GB. The efficacy of PDT as a tumor treatment modality is predicated on its highly selective nature, which means a low incidence of adverse effects. Consequently, this treatment has been shown to enhance patients’ quality of life. Furthermore, the utilization of nanotechnology as a delivery system for these PSs has demonstrated substantial progress, as evidenced by a notable reduction in systemic toxicity. However, it is imperative to advance the design of more effective NPs that have the ability to penetrate the BBB in order to improve therapeutic outcomes.
