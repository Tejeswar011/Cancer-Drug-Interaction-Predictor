Cancer Science https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ This is an open access article under the terms of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ABSTRACT We previously reported that androgen receptor (AR) signaling blockade induces chemotactic‐C–C‐motif‐chemokine‐ligand‐2 (CCL2) secretion from prostate cancer cells and activates cancer cells through an autocrine manner. However, the mechanism of how AR negatively regulates CCL2 expression is still unclear. As various microRNAs participate in prostate cancer development, we hypothesized that there are AR‐controlled miRs that regulate CCL2 production. Using LNCaP and C4‐2B cells, miR‐124‐3p.2 was found as a potential miR from the miRNA PCR array and public database. The expression of miR‐124‐3p.2 was inhibited by knockdown AR, and the introduction of miR‐124‐3p.2 mimic decreased CCL2 expression and suppressed cell migration. Dihydrotestosterone led to miR‐124‐3p.2 upregulation and CCL2 downregulation. To examine whether miR‐124‐3p.2 and CCL2 are involved in prostate cancer progression, their expression levels and clinical parameters were analyzed using prostate biopsy samples and whole blood RNAs obtained from the biopsied patients. Patients with low miR‐124‐3p.2 and high CCL2 levels showed a shorter time to castration‐resistant prostate cancer development than those with high miR‐124‐3p.2 and low CCL2 levels. Our study demonstrated that AR suppresses CCL2 expression via miR‐124‐3p.2, and the miR‐124‐3p.2‐CCL2 axis may be a novel therapeutic target and a useful blood prognostic biomarker for advanced prostate cancer. We identified a novel mechanism where AR signaling suppresses CCL2 expression through miR‐124‐3p.2, which regulates cancer cell migration and progression. Patients with low miR‐124‐3p.2 and high CCL2 levels exhibited faster progression to castration‐resistant prostate cancer, highlighting the potential of the miR‐124‐3p.2–CCL2 axis as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker. androgen receptor castration‐resistant prostate cancer CCL2 microRNA whole blood RNA JSPS KAKENHI 22K09495 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Funding: Abbreviations AR androgen receptor CCL2 chemotactic‐C–C‐motif‐chemokine‐ligand‐2 CRPC castration‐resistant prostate cancer DHT dihydrotestosterone FBS fetal bovine serum LNA locked nucleic acid miR microRNA OS overall survival PSA prostate‐specific antigen siAR androgen receptor‐specific siRNA siRNA small interfering RNA TBST tris‐buffered saline with Tween 1 Introduction Prostate cancer ranks as the second most common cancer among men and stands as the fifth leading cause of cancer‐related deaths. It accounts for approximately 15% of all male cancers and contributes to about 7% of cancer‐related fatalities in men [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 10 3 14 9 10 15 16 10 10 17 18 19 20 17 18 21 22 23 24 25 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Cell Lines LNCaP and C4‐2B human prostate cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia). LNCaP and C4‐2B cells were grown in an RPMI‐1640 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 2.2 Transfection of Small Interfering RNAs siRNAs miR DHT Androgen receptor‐specific siRNA (siAR) and a validated nontargeted siRNA (Stealth RNAi siRNA Negative Control Med GC Duplex #2) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. LNCaP and C4‐2B cells were seeded in six‐well plates and transfected with 20 nM of siRNA and each miR mimic 24 h later (Table S1 2.3 Extraction and Quantification of mRNA miR mRNA was extracted from the cell lines using the Direct‐zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, California) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted mRNA was converted to first‐strand cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, California), and the gene expression profiles were assessed using RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). Quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) was performed using the CFX Connect Real‐Time System (Bio‐Rad). The expression of mRNA was detected using the SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio‐Rad). The mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase. The miRs were extracted from the cell lines using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracted miRs were purified using the miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and gene expression profiles were evaluated using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). The miR levels were normalized to SNORD61. The RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primers used are listed in Tables S2 S3 2.4 Western Blot Analysis Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail containing 1% protease inhibitor (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri). Soluble lysates were mixed with a sample buffer containing lithium dodecyl sulfate and a sample reducing agent (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific), and proteins were separated by SDS‐PAGE. Prior to protein transfer, PVDF membranes were activated and blocked for 1 h at room temperature. Blocking conditions varied by target protein: for AR and α‐tublin membranes, they were blocked with 1% gelatin and 0.05% Tween‐20 in Tris‐buffered saline with Tween (TBST); for CCL2, PVDF Blocking Reagent (NYPBR01; Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) were used. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. All primary antibodies were diluted in TBST containing 3% BSA and 0.2% gelatin. For the CCL2 antibody, Can Get Signal Solution 1 (NKB‐101; Toyobo) was used to enhance signal detection. After three washes in TBST, membranes were incubated with HRP‐conjugated anti‐rabbit or anti‐mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Protein loading control was assessed using an anti‐α‐tublin antibody. Protein bands were visualized using the Clarity Max Western ECL Substrate (Bio‐Rad). The primary antibodies were listed in Table S4 2.5 Identification of miRs To determine the miRs regulated by AR, LNCaP and C4‐2B cells were treated with siAR and analyzed using the miR PCR array and miScript miRNA PCR Plate Array (Qiagen) to compare the control and siAR‐treated groups. miRs with ≥ 2.5‐fold downregulation in response to AR suppression in both the LNCaP and C4‐2B siAR‐treated cells were selected (Table S5 https://www.targetscan.org 2.6 Proliferation Assay LNCaP or C4‐2B cells (10 × 10 4 2.7 Migration Assay Cell migration assays were performed using 8.0‐μm pore transwell inserts in 24‐well culture plates. Prostate cancer cells were grown to 80% confluency in appropriate media. The upper chamber contained approximately 8 × 10 4 4 2 2.8 Elisa The secretion of CCL2 from the prostate cancer cell lines was measured using the Human CCL2/MCP‐1 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Absorbance was recorded at 450 nm and corrected at 540 nm using a microplate reader. 2.9  RNA A prostate biopsy sample was placed in an Invitrogen RNAlater solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −80°C. The tissue sample was obtained from the site of the suspected cancer based on the magnetic resonance imaging findings. RNA extraction was performed following the protocol of the miRNA mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA was eluted in 50 μL of RNase‐free water and stored at −80°C. Concurrently, blood samples were collected at the time of biopsy, and 2.5 mL of whole blood was placed in a PAXgene RNA collection tube (Becton Dickinson, Fukushima, Japan) for 2 h at room temperature before being stored at −80°C. RNA was then extracted following the protocol of the blood miRNA kit (Qiagen), eluted in 100 μL of RNase‐free water, and stored at −80°C. The QIAcube system (Qiagen) was utilized to collect the miRNAs during this process. 2.10 Quantification of mRNA miR The RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The extracted mRNA was converted to first‐strand cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio‐Rad), and mRNA expression was detected using the SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio‐Rad). For the prostate tissue, the mRNA levels were normalized using the geometric mean of ACTB and β2M, whereas for the blood mRNA, they were normalized using the geometric mean of ACTB and RPLP2. The extracted miR was converted to locked nucleic acids (LNAs) using the miRCURY LNA RT kit (Qiagen). For the miR expression detection, the miRCURY LNA miRNA PCR Assay (Qiagen) was utilized. For the prostate tissue and blood samples, the miR levels were normalized using the geometric mean of ACTB and β2M, whereas for the blood samples, they were normalized to SNORD48. The high and low expression levels for each were expressed relative to the median. The primers used are listed in Tables S2 S6 2.11 Patients Altogether, 287 patients who underwent prostate biopsy at our hospital between July 2019 and April 2023 were initially considered for this study. At this time, the prostate biopsy sample for RNA detection and whole blood RNA were collected with PAXgene. The present study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Kanazawa University [2019‐012 (3043)]. 2.12 Definition of CRPC CRPC was defined as a condition where a patient, despite being on ADT and having a testosterone level of 50 ng/dL, exhibited elevated prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) levels on two consecutive occasions, whose PSA levels remained elevated without decreasing to < 1.0 ng/mL, or whose imaging studies showed new or worsening lesions [ 26 2.13 Statistical Analysis Significant differences in the patients' background characteristics were assessed using the Mann–Whitney U p 3 Results 3.1 Identification of Target miRs To investigate whether AR‐controlled miRs regulate CCL2 expression, we first searched for miRs that bind to the 3ʹ UTR of CCL2 using a public database and identified miR‐124‐3p.2 and miR‐506‐3p (Figure S1 1a,b FIGURE 1 Identification of target miRs. (a) RT‐PCR of AR expression in LNCaP and C4‐2B cells transfected with control or siAR was performed. (b) Western blotting of AR protein expression in LNCaP and C4‐2B cells transfected with control or siAR was performed. (c) The expression of miR‐124‐3p.2 and miR‐506‐3p in LNCaP and C4‐2B was examined with or without siAR. (d) CCL2 expression in LNCaP and C4‐2B cells with or without siAR transfected with miR mimics was evaluated. Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean. ** p p p To determine whether miR‐124‐3p.2 and miR‐506‐3p are regulated by AR, their miR expression levels were measured in the siAR cells. The siAR cells decreased the miR‐124‐3p.2 expression level, whereas the miR‐506‐3p expression level remained constant (Figure 1c 1d 3.2  miR AR CCL2 To confirm whether miR‐124‐3p.2 is actually regulated by AR signaling, AR signaling was activated by DHT. DHT led to increased miR‐124‐3p.2 levels and decreased CCL2 expression (Figure 2a,b 2c 2d 2e FIGURE 2 miR‐124‐3p.2 is controlled by AR and inhibits CCL2 secretion. (a) Differences in the expression of miR‐124‐3p.2 between LNCaP and C4‐2B cells treated with or without 10 nM DHT were examined. (b) Differences in CCL2 expression between LNCaP and C4‐2B cells treated with or without 10 nM DHT were examined. (c) Differences in the expression of CCL2 in between LNCaP and C4‐2B cells with siAR as well as with or without the miR‐124‐3p.2 mimic were examined. (d) Western blotting of CCL2 protein expression in LNCaP and C4‐2B cells transfected with control, siAR, and siAR + miR‐124‐3p.2 mimic was performed. (e) Differences in the secretion of CCL2 in LNCaP and C4‐2B cells with or without the miR‐124‐3p.2 mimic were examined by ELISA. (f) Differences in the migration ability of LNCaP and C4‐2B cells with siAR as well as with or without miR‐124‐3p.2 mimic were examined through a migration assay. Bars in pictures indicate 500 μm. Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean. * p p p p The impact of miR‐124‐3p.2 on cell migration was assessed using a migration assay. As previously reported, the siAR treatment enhanced cell migration, whereas transfection with the miR‐124‐3p.2 mimic canceled the enhanced migration (Figure 2f 3.3 Clinical Significance of AR miR CCL2 We assessed the expression levels of AR, miR‐124‐3p.2, and CCL2 in the prostate biopsy samples. Among the 287 biopsied samples, 30 patients were excluded from the analysis because of the following reasons: specimens had poor quality ( n n n 3a 1 FIGURE 3 miR‐124‐3p.2 and CCL2 as biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.

Although no significant difference in OS was observed (Figure S2a,b p 3c p 3d 1 2 S2c–f 4 Discussion The mechanism of protein inhibition by miRs is unique and theoretically reasonable for our hypothesis because of the reverse relationship between AR and CCL2 changes, i.e., an activation and a deactivation. Although AR regulates some miRs and some miRs control CCL2 [ 27 28 29 30 4 FIGURE 4 A schematic illustration of mechanisms of CCL2 secretion due to AR blockade. The incomplete mechanism via the PIAS3/STAT3 axis was previously proposed, and the novel miR‐124‐3p.2/CCL2 axis was suggested as a more potential mechanism based on the results of the current study. After confirmation of the miR‐124‐3p.2 function in vitro, we analyzed the expression levels of CCL2 and miR‐124‐3p.2 in the prostate biopsy samples and whole blood RNA. Significant differences in the AR and miR‐124‐3p.2 RNA levels in the tissues were observed between the prostate cancer and no‐malignancy groups. The AR and miR‐124‐3p.2 expressions in the prostate cancer group were found to be higher and lower, respectively. These results are consistent with the finding that AR induced miR‐124‐3p.2 expression. However, the physiological function of miR‐124‐3p.2 in benign tissues is completely unclear, and the relationship between AR and miR‐124‐3p.2 is likely to be different in malignant and benign cells. In fact, several studies have reported that miR‐124‐3p.2 is downregulated in patients with malignancy [ 31 32 33 Among the prostate cancer patients stratified by their miR‐124‐3p.2 and CCL2 expression levels, Group C showed significantly worse time to CRPC development than Group A. In our in vitro results, we found that a higher miR‐124‐3p.2 level leads to a lower CCL2 level; therefore, the expression patterns in Groups A and C were reasonable and the survival outcomes were also consistent with our in vitro data. However, the existence of Groups B1 and B2 as well as high–high and low–low patterns, accounting for 54% of the prostate cancer cases, might not be theoretical. The AR expression and cancer progression appear to be inconsistent [ 34 35 36 Whole blood RNA was also analyzed across the three groups. Whole blood includes a wide variety of RNA originating from not only circulating prostate cancer cells but also immune cells and microparticles, such as exosomes. The miR expression levels in the whole blood also vary according to the disease status [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 In conclusion, our study findings demonstrated that AR suppresses CCL2 expression via miR‐124‐3p.2 based on the analyses of basic and clinical data. Moreover, the miR‐124‐3p.2/CCL2 axis may be a novel therapeutic target and a useful blood prognostic biomarker for advanced prostate cancer.
