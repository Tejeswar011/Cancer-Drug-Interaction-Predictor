Apoptosis is a major type of programmed cell death tightly associated with cancer development and treatment. Evasion of apoptosis is considered a key hallmark of cancer and acquisition of apoptosis resistance is accordingly a key mechanism of drug acquired resistance in cancer therapy. It has been clearly shown that effective induction of apoptosis is a key mechanism for third generation EGFR-TKIs, particularly osimertinib, to exert their therapeutic efficacies and the development of resistance to apoptosis is tightly associated with the emergence of acquired resistance. Hence, restoration of cell sensitivity to undergo apoptosis using various means promises an effective strategy for the management of acquired resistance to third generation EGFR-TKIs.
