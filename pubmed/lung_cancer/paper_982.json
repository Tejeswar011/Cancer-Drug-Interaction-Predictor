Their smaller size may reduce the incidence of thrombosis, a common complication associated with indwelling vascular devices[ 10 11 12 13 14 Existing literature reflects the ongoing debate over the optimal choice of catheter lumen configuration, emphasizing the need for evidence-based guidelines to inform practice[ 15 16 vs This retrospective cohort study focuses on evaluating clinical outcomes and patient-reported experiences with single-lumen and double-lumen PICCs in a digestive surgical setting, underpinned by a robust bundled care strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data This retrospective cohort study involved 249 patients who visited the digestive surgery department at the Quzhou Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Quzhou People’s Hospital between January 2021 and June 2024. The patients utilized either single-lumen or double-lumen PICCs in bundled care contexts. They were categorized into two groups: Single-lumen group (117) and double-lumen group (132). Patient information was collected from the hospital’s case system. De-identified patient data were employed to ensure that no potential harm could come to the patients, thus allowing for a waiver of informed consent. The Ethics Review Committee of the Quzhou Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Quzhou People’s Hospital approved the exemption and the research, ensuring compliance with applicable regulatory and ethical standards. Inclusion and exclusion criteria  Inclusion criteria: 1 17  The exclusion criteria: 18 Catheter insertion and maintenance A 4Fr single-lumen PICC kit and accessories (Bard, United States, model: 3174118) were utilized in the single-lumen group, whereas a 5Fr double-lumen kit and accessories (Bard, United States, model: 3275118) were used in the double-lumen group. Both groups underwent the same catheter insertion and maintenance procedures. During catheter insertion, the patients were positioned supine. Using ultrasound guidance, an upper arm vein was selected, and catheter length and arm circumference were measured. The upper arm was abducted at a 90° angle. The area was disinfected and draped, sterile gloves and an ultrasound probe cover were used, and each lumen of the catheter was pre-flushed with saline. The guidewire was retracted, and the catheter length was trimmed to 1 cm less than the predicted length. Ultrasound was used again to evaluate the vein, and a tourniquet was applied. The left hand held the probe to display the optimal vascular image, whereas the right hand held the puncture needle at a 60°-70° angle to the elbow. Once blood return was observed, the guidewire was advanced at approximately 20 cm. The puncture needle was withdrawn, and the Seldinger technique was employed. The puncture site was locally anesthetized, and the skin was dilated before advancing the dilator and sheath along the guidewire into the vein. The dilator was removed, and the catheter was gently introduced to the desired length. Ultrasound confirmed correct catheter tip placement, and the supporting guidewire and sheath were removed. Blood return was assessed with a syringe filled with saline, followed by pulsatile flushing of the lumen, closure with a lock, and positive pressure sealing with heparin saline. Hemostasis was achieved by compressing the puncture site, followed by securing the catheter. An X-ray was taken post-procedure to confirm catheter placement. Regular maintenance observations were conducted post-insertion. For the first 24 hours, observations were performed once and then weekly. During maintenance, the PICC line’s end was secured with tape. The old dressing was removed from the bottom upward, and the wound was disinfected with iodine, starting from the center and moving outward in a circular motion without retraction. The disinfection area had a diameter of more than 10 cm, and the part of the catheter outside the body required disinfection. Once the iodine dried, de-iodination with alcohol was performed in a circular outward motion, covering an area larger than that disinfected with iodine. After the alcohol evaporated and dried, sterile paper tape strips (Smith & Nephew, model: IV3000) were applied horizontally to secure the fixation wings. Transparent dressings (Smith & Nephew, model: IV3000) were then used to cover the puncture site and the surrounding 10 cm of skin, with two additional paper tape strips used to cross-fix the line external to the dressing. The positive pressure connector was replaced. The catheter was flushed with 10 mL of saline pulse and then sealed with 4 mL of heparin saline. A 3M wound dressing (3M, United States, model: 3662CU) was used to cover the positive pressure connector. During each maintenance session, the patients were monitored for signs of infection, thrombosis, displacement, or occlusion. Ultrasound examination of the upper extremity veins was conducted using high-frequency linear transducers (10-14 MHz) to ensure consistency and accuracy in thrombosis assessment. The presence of intraluminal echogenic material within a vein, causing partial or complete obstruction of blood flow, was considered indicative of thrombosis. Images were reviewed by two independent radiologists to minimize bias. In cases where clinical symptoms suggested thrombosis but ultrasound findings were inconclusive, further imaging methods, such as X-rays, were considered. These criteria were applied consistently across all patients to ensure reliable and comparable thrombosis assessments. Bundled care approach Both groups received a bundled care approach comprising the following components:  Formation of a bundled care team: Establishment of standardized PICC procedures: Standardized procedures for the use and sealing of PICCs were implemented. Nursing staff were required to rigorously apply sterile techniques and carefully monitor the catheter insertion site and surrounding skin. Disinfection was performed from the inside out to minimize the risk of prolonged catheter exposure.  Enhanced skill training:  Focus on psychological and nutritional interventions:  Regular evaluation and update of care plans: Biochemical parameters and respiratory function tests Three weeks post-catheterization, two vials of fasting venous blood were collected. One vial was drawn into an EDTA-K2 anticoagulant tube and analyzed using an automated blood cell analyzer (Mindray BC6800, Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., China) to assess hemoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. The second vial was collected in a standard vacuum tube, allowed to clot, and then processed in a refrigerated high-speed centrifuge (TLD 12A, Hunan Xiangxi Scientific Instrument Factory, China) at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The serum was isolated and analyzed using a fully automated biochemical analyzer (Cobas 8000, Roche, Switzerland) to measure the levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, blood glucose, and serum creatinine. Respiratory function was assessed using the Vmax Spectra 229D cardiopulmonary function testing system (Becton, Dickinson and Company, United States). The patients’ normal breathing rate was recorded initially. The patients were instructed to inhale maximally and then exhale as forcefully and as quickly as possible, with the volume exhaled in the first second recorded as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Following a maximal inhale, the total volume exhaled as quickly and completely was recorded as forced vital capacity (FVC). The maximum flow rate achieved during forced expiration, known as peak expiratory flow (PEF), was documented. The patients then inhaled a gas mixture containing trace carbon monoxide and immediately exhaled. The concentration of carbon monoxide in the exhaled air was analyzed to determine the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Hemodynamic stability Three weeks after catheter insertion, the patients’ heart rate variability, blood pressure variability, and blood oxygen saturation were recorded using a real-time electrocardiogram monitor (OSEN8000, Shenyang). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated using the following formula: MAP = (2 × diastolic pressure + systolic pressure)/3. Central venous pressure (CVP) was measured through a catheter connected to a central vein. The pressure measuring tube was positioned so that its zero point aligned horizontally with the midpoint of the right atrium. Before insertion, the connecting tube and venous catheter were filled with fluid, and air bubbles were expelled. The pressure tube was filled with fluid, with the liquid level set higher than the expected venous pressure. The three-way stopcock was adjusted to connect the pressure tube to the PICC, enabling pressure measurement. When not measuring, the stopcock was turned to connect the infusion bottle to the venous catheter, which provided additional fluids and maintained catheter patency. Patient satisfaction scores Three weeks following catheter placement, a survey questionnaire was administered to assess patient satisfaction across four dimensions: Comfort, satisfaction with care, satisfaction with treatment outcomes, and pain level. The first three dimensions were scored on a scale of up to 10 points, with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction. The pain level was scored up to 10 points, evaluating the pain experienced during the catheterization process, and a higher pain score indicated a more significant impact on the patient’s normal daily activities. Statistical analysis Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 29.0) statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). Categorical data were expressed as counts and percentages [ n T χ 2 P RESULTS Demographic characteristics The mean ages were 55.23 ± 10.12 years for the single-lumen group and 56.57 ± 11.34 years for the double-lumen group, with no statistically significant difference ( P 1 P P P vs P P P Table 1 Comparison of demographic characteristics between two groups, n   Single-lumen group ( n  Double-lumen group ( n   t/χ   P Age (years) 55.23 ± 10.12 56.57 ± 11.34 0.976 0.33 Body mass index (kg/m 2 23.78 ± 3.45 23.84 ± 3.67 0.117 0.907 Female/male 65 (55.56)/52 (44.44) 69 (52.27)/63 (47.73) 0.269 0.604 Smoking history (yes/no) 32 (27.35)/85 (72.65) 33 (25)/99 (75) 0.178 0.673 Drinking history (yes/no) 41 (35.04)/76 (64.96) 40 (30.3)/92 (69.7) 0.635 0.426 Hypertension (yes/no) 26 (22.22)/91 (77.78) 29 (21.97)/103 (78.03) 0.002 0.962 Diabetes (yes/no) 21 (17.95)/96 (82.05) 19 (14.39)/113 (85.61) 0.581 0.446 Educational level (junior college graduate or lower/college graduate or higher) 75 (64.1)/42 (35.9) 76 (57.58)/56 (42.42) 1.107 0.293 Marital status (married/unmarried) 97 (82.91)/20 (17.09) 104 (78.79)/28 (21.21) 0.676 0.411 Ethnicity (Han/other) 107 (91.45)/10 (8.55) 119 (90.15)/13 (9.85) 0.125 0.723 In the single-lumen group, 75.21% underwent surgery for gastrointestinal tumors; 15.38% had procedures for intestinal obstruction; and 3.42% were treated for gastrointestinal trauma, 3.42% for gastroduodenal ulcer, and 2.56% for abdominal tuberculosis.

The study’s rigorous maintenance protocol, including regular disinfectant procedures and frequent line inspections, likely mitigated the impact of having an extra lumen in terms of infection risk. The bundled care approach, with standardized insertion and maintenance protocols, likely contributed to low and comparable infection rates, reinforcing the pivotal role of such measures in catheter management[ 22 23 Patient satisfaction was another critical factor that this study examined. The satisfaction scores were notably higher in the single-lumen group, and this finding may be attributed to the less intrusive nature of these catheters. The patients reported higher comfort scores and lower pain levels during the catheterization process, perhaps due to the smaller catheter size. These subjective measures reflect the importance of considering patient comfort and perceived pain in clinical decisions and support the use of single-lumen catheters when medically feasible, especially in patients more sensitive to discomfort or undergoing longer treatments. The compatibility of single-lumen PICCs with equal hemodynamic stability as double-lumen PICCs challenges the notion that more complex catheter systems provide marked advantages in terms of physiological metrics. Both groups demonstrated stable heart rates, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation levels, indicating that either catheter type could maintain cardiac and pulmonary sufficiency postoperatively. The lack of statistical significance in these parameters suggests that single-lumen catheters offer equivalent physiological support without the added risks associated with double-lumen systems. The duration of catheterization presents an interesting angle in understanding efficiency in clinical practice. Single-lumen PICCs demonstrated shorter catheterization duration and higher infusion success rates. This efficiency gain may reflect easier management and less technical difficulty associated with single-lumen catheters. The smaller size and lesser mechanical complexity of single-lumen catheters facilitate quicker insertion, easier maintenance, and potentially fewer malfunctions or technical issues during use. This factor can enhance workflow efficiency in busy surgical settings where the reduction in procedural time is beneficial for patients and healthcare providers. The examination of biochemical and respiratory parameters demonstrated that the lack of significant differences between groups underscores that both catheter types can effectively support the physiological requirements of patients undergoing digestive surgery. These similar outcomes suggest that the choice between single and double-lumen PICCs could prioritize considerations other than direct biochemical or respiratory impact such as comfort, risk of thrombosis, or specific requirements for concurrent infusions. While the study data indicate that single-lumen PICCs performed better in terms of thrombosis rates, comfort, and procedural efficiency, recognizing the indispensable role of double-lumen PICCs in specific clinical scenarios is crucial. Double-lumen PICCs offer distinct advantages in situations where multiple concurrent infusions are required, such as simultaneous administration of parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, and chemotherapy. These catheters allow for simultaneous delivery of different fluids without the need for frequent line changes or additional venous access points, which can reduce the risk of infection and improve patient management efficiency. For example, in critically ill patients who require multiple medications with incompatible properties, double-lumen PICCs provide a safe and effective solution by ensuring that each medication is delivered through a separate lumen, thus minimizing the risk of drug interactions and complications[ 24 Of particular relevance was the bundled care approach implemented for all patients that may have contributed to the consistently positive results across both PICC types. The structured interventions - emphasizing standardized procedures, staff training, psychological assessments, nutritional support, and continuous care plan improvements - likely provided a protective effect across numerous dimensions of patient care, thereby reducing variability and enhancing outcome quality[ 25 26 27 The context of bundled care enables healthcare workers to focus not only on clinical but also holistic aspects of patient care, such as providing psychological and nutritional support[ 28 29 30 31 One limitation of this study is the absence of multivariate analyses to control for potential confounding factors such as type of surgery, medication regimen, and baseline health status. While significant differences in thrombosis rates and other outcomes were observed between the single-lumen and double-lumen PICC groups, the lack of adjustment for these confounders may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future studies should consider incorporating multivariate analyses to better account for these variables and provide more robust evidence regarding the comparative efficacy and safety of different PICC types. Another limitation is that this study focused on short-term complications ( e.g. e.g. Ultimately, this study highlights the nuanced considerations required when selecting the appropriate PICC for each patient. The single-lumen PICC shows advantages in terms of comfort, procedural efficiency, and lower thrombosis risk, making it preferable when these factors are prioritized. However, double-lumen catheters still serve a crucial purpose in clinical scenarios where multiple concurrent infusions are necessary. The findings suggest that a tailored approach, evaluating individual patient needs, the anticipated duration of catheter use, and specific clinical circumstances, is essential for optimizing care outcomes[ 32 33 CONCLUSION While this study provides a comparative analysis of single-lumen vs  Institutional review board statement:  Informed consent statement:  Conflict-of-interest statement:  Provenance and peer review:  Peer-review model:  Specialty type:  Country of origin:  Peer-review report’s classification  Scientific Quality:  Novelty:  Creativity or Innovation:  Scientific Significance:  P-Reviewer: S-Editor: L-Editor: P-Editor: 1 Bae HS Kim KY Han YM Comparison of complications between reverse-tapered and nontapered peripherally inserted central catheters PLoS One 2023 18 e0285445 37141269 10.1371/journal.pone.0285445 PMC10159135 2 D'Arrigo S Sandroni C Cacciola S Dell'Anna AM Pittiruti M Annetta MG Colosimo C Antonelli M Are single-lumen 5Fr and triple-lumen 6Fr PICCs suitable for hemodynamic assessment by trans-pulmonary thermodilution?
