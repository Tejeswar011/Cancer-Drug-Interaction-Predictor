Data were collected from the EHR at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, a large multi-campus academic children’s hospital in a large metropolitan area in the south-eastern United States. The objective of this study was to use EHR-data sources to (1) describe the demographic and clinical correlates of HICP, including frequency of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 CP diagnoses codes; in the full cohort, by sex, and by history of frequent healthcare utilization for pain; (2) evaluate for longitudinal trends in pain episode frequency for up to 10 years leading up to the time of diagnosis of HICP at consultation for HCT; in the full cohort, and by age and sex; and (3) explore for latent classes of individuals based on longitudinal trends in pain episode frequency leading up to the to the time of diagnosis of HICP. Inclusion/exclusion criteria Individuals with SCD (any genotype) <22 years of age who attended a consultation for HCT and were diagnosed with HICP as described above during the consultation were included. To assess for inclusion, we reviewed the consult visit note to ascertain for physician documentation for the presence of HICP. Three items drawn and adapted from the National Pain Strategy (NPS) Pilot Test were used 16 16 5 16 We excluded individuals who did not meet inclusion criteria, or who were not screened for HICP, or if there was absence of documentation regarding diagnosis of HICP. Clinical phenotype characteristics Clinical phenotype characteristics were abstracted from the EHR by manual review by the study investigators. HCU for pain included acute care visit (Emergency Department or Day-Hospital) or hospitalization for pain for up to 10 years from the referent consult visit. Records from each acute care visit or hospitalization were reviewed by study investigators to ensure that it was consistent with a visit for acute sickle cell pain, 3 26 27 28 29 Statistical analyses Primary statistical analysis was performed in CRAN R v.4.0.2 (Vienna, Austria) and SAS v.9.4 (Cary, NC). We used descriptive statistics to characterize demographic, clinical, and pain-related variables. Hypothesis testing was done using Chi 2 t This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. RESULTS Forty-six individuals met criteria for HICP. Of those 46, 42 had either a response of “usually” or “always” when asked how often pain limited life or work activities, including household chores or a response of “moderate” or “severe” interference when asked how much pain interfered with life activities documented in the EHR. For the remaining four individuals, the response to items on pain frequency and persistence were not documented, but physician documentation noted that they had HICP. Item-level responses were not recorded for all individuals for every item. Of the individuals for whom item-level responses were available, 37 (of 42 available responses, 88%) reported “severe interference” in response to how much pain interfered with life or work activities, 39 (of 40 available responses, 97.5%) reported “usually” or “always” in response to how often pain interfered with life or work activities, and 34 reported both “severe interference” in response to how much pain interfered with life activities and “usually” or “always” in response to item asking about frequency of pain interference. All but one who reported severe pain interference also reported frequent pain interference. Clinical phenotype Clinical phenotype and correlates are reported in Table 1 n n n n n n n n n Table 1.

Latent-class growth model classifications and model-estimated curves of healthcare utilization for pain/year. DISCUSSION The results of this study represent the first description of the clinical phenotype of HICP using EHR data. Overall, the study confirmed the high burden of disease morbidity experienced by children with SCD who attend a consultation for HCT and have HICP. Most individuals in this cohort experienced frequent HCU for pain, more frequent than previous reports in SCD. 30 22 31 32 33 13 About one-third of individuals in this cohort had AVN, consistent with previous observations that AVN occurs frequently in CP, 5 , 34 , 35 36 , 37 38 39 32 33 35 , 40 41–44 45 This study also provided some insights into using surrogate markers from the EHR to identify people with CP in SCD. Importantly, not all individuals with HICP experienced frequent HCU for pain, and screening for HICP identifies a subgroup who experiences CP and disability but does not experience high healthcare utilization for pain. Less than half of the individuals in this cohort had a diagnoses code for CP, and the association of diagnoses codes for CP with frequent HCU for pain suggested that those with frequent HCU for pain were more likely to be identified as having HICP. Similarly, the use of NeP medications or adjuvant analgesics as surrogates for HICP may pose a challenge as the prescription of these medications was associated with frequent HCU for pain. The prescription of adjuvant analgesics in this cohort may also be confounded by the frequency of contact with the healthcare system for pain. The overall daily outpatient prescribed MME in children with HICP and SCD were lower than that previously reported in adults with SCD and chronic pain. 46 , 47 5 , 48 Our study has several limitations. The individuals in this study with SCD and HICP were identified at the time of a consultation for HCT in a limited timeframe between 2019 and 2020. Given the institutional practice of accepting referrals to discuss HCT regardless of disease severity or availability of a donor, the individuals attending consultation for HCT may not have been representative of individuals attending consultation for HCT in institutions that may use different considerations for referrals for HCT. Additionally, not all patients with SCD and CP desire a consult for HCT, and system- and patient-related factors may not allow a patient who is referred to attend a consult for HCT. 32 16 5 16 16 48 The findings in this study were based on data available in the EHR, so it is possible that some clinical characteristics or episodes of HCU for pain outside our institution were not captured. Similarly, only visit-level diagnoses codes from the EHR were available. Given the nature of EHR data, we were unable to confirm adherence to medications and were limited to medications prescribed in the EHR. Additionally, only outpatient opioid prescriptions in the EHR were used to calculate daily MME, and opioids prescribed at other sites or in the hospital during emergency room, day hospital, or inpatient stays were not accounted for, which underestimated the cumulative doses of opioids prescribed, especially for those individuals that experienced frequent or prolonged hospitalizations. Given the nature of EHR data, we could not collect data on psychological co-morbidities associated with HICP. Lastly, the results of this study are from a single large institution. Future multi-institutional studies should confirm these findings. Such studies should also prospectively study social determinants of health, as well as predictors, outcomes of HICP in SCD, and the longitudinal outcomes of HICP in SCD. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that in SCD, the clinical phenotype of HICP is associated with substantial morbidity. The results of this study suggest formal screening to identify individuals with HICP as clinical correlates of HICP from the EHR are likely to identify those who experience frequent HCU for pain. HICP in SCD should be studied in prospective studies to guide risk-stratification of CP for clinical care and research.
