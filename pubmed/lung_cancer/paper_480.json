That is, the cost of payment is used to replace the risk of death, thus putting forward the value of statistical life method 28 The assessment methods for value of statistical life mainly include wage risk method, conditional value method and choice experiment method. The assessment results of each method vary in different application scenarios 29 31 32 2.5 33 U 6 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$U\\, = \\,V\\, + \\,\\varepsilon$$\\end{document} U = V + ε 7 where the variable V ε c β bid I bid I b r r γ m X nm X nm In fact, the distribution of utility probability variable function ε 8 According to Hanemann 34 9 According to the definition of value of statistical life, the expression of value of statistical life obtained by the binary method is as follows: 10 Where T ∆R Assessment model and results This section present the health impact assessment model for PM 2.5 Health impacts assessment In this study, the relative risk model is used to assess the health impacts of reducing PM 2.5 11 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta y\\, = \\,[(RR\\left( c \\right){-\\!\\!-}{1})/ \\, RR\\left( c \\right)]\\, \\times \\,y\\, \\times \\,Pop,$$\\end{document} Δ y = [ ( R R c - - 1 ) / R R c ] × y × P o p , here. 12 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$RR\\left( c \\right)\\, = \\,exp[\\beta (c{-\\!\\!-}c_{0} )].$$\\end{document} R R c = e x p [ β ( c - - c 0 ) ] .

The specific formula is given in Section\" Assessment method for unit health economic losses The per capita disposable income of Beijing and Tianjin in each year is shown in Fig. 2 13 Fig. 2 Per capita disposable income. For the assessment of economic losses caused by hospitalization of various health terminals, this study uses the cost of illness approach. Disease costs include all direct costs and indirect costs during patient visits. The average hospitalization costs and average hospitalization days for respiratory diseases are replaced by the average hospitalization costs and average hospitalization days for tuberculosis, pneumonia and pulmonary heart disease. The hospitalization costs for corresponding diseases can be obtained from the China Health Statistics Yearbook for each year. Specifically, for the average hospitalization costs in Beijing and Tianjin, this study assumes that the ratio of the per capita disposable income of the residents in the country to the hospitalization costs of various diseases is equal to the ratio of the per capita disposable income of the residents in the two cities to the corresponding hospitalization costs of various diseases, thus estimating the average hospitalization costs of various diseases in the two cities. Similarly, the average hospitalization costs of acute myocardial infarction are used to replace the average hospitalization costs of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Specifically, for Beijing and Tianjin, the calculation method is the same as that of respiratory system diseases. The average hospitalization days caused by respiratory system diseases and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in the two cities are replaced by the average hospitalization days of corresponding diseases in the country.The specific values are listed in Table 3 Table 3 Average hospitalization days and medical expenses of each health terminal.

Then, combined with the unit economic losses of various health terminals, the total economic losses of the corresponding health terminals in each year are estimated. The following is divided into two parts: evaluating and analyzing the health impacts of PM 2.5 2.5 Health impacts analysis Table 5 2.5 2.5 Specifically, the most obvious health impact brought by reducing PM 2.5 2.5 For Tianjin, the change trend of various health terminals is the same as that of Beijing, but the proportion structure of the total health impact is different from that of Beijing. For example, the proportion of respiratory disease-related hospitalization is around 59%, slightly lower than that of Beijing.The health impact rankings of other health terminals are also the same as those of Beijing, but the number of beneficiaries in the same health terminal is significantly lower than that of Beijing. As shown in Fig. 1 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 In addition, the total health impact of Beijing and Tianjin in each year is as follows: Beijing: 25,805, 19,292, 16,310, 12,211, 10,153, 8098 persons, with an average annual decrease of 20.59%; Tianjin: 13,925, 11,710, 9110, 8825, 8135, 5887 persons, with an average annual decrease of 15.34%. The difference in the decrease between the two cities is significant, which also reflects the significant effect of Beijing’s governance on PM 2.5 2.5 This study also estimate the health impacts of reducing ozone concentration to the first-level concentration limit, as shown in Table 6 2.5 2.5 2.5 In Beijing, the total health impacts of reducing the ozone concentration to 100 µg/m 3 By comparing Table 5 6 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 Economic losses assessment Based on the assessment results of health impacts in the previous section, combined with the unit economic losses of each health terminal in Table 4 2.5 7 8 4 5 Table 7 Economic losses caused by PM 2.5 Health terminal 2016 2017 2018 Beijing Tianjin Beijing Tianjin Beijing Tianjin Death AC 31.11 (14.87,47.92) 14.39 (6.87,22.17) 31.13 (14.86,48.03) 13.62 (6.50,21.00) 33.68 (16.06,51.99) 13.63 (6.50,21.04) CCSR 10.39 (2.97,17.46) 5.73 (1.64,9.63) 10.01 (2.86,16.86) 5.87 (1.68,9.88) 10.60 (3.02,17.87) 5.18 (1.48,8.74) RSR 13.62 (8.23,18.83) 4.67 (2.82,6.47) 13.86 (8.34,19.24) 4.53 (2.73,6.28) 14.94 (8.97,20.78) 3.94 (2.37,5.48) Hospitalization CCDR 3.02 (1.93,4.11) 1.10 (0.70,1.50) 2.57 (1.63,3.49) 0.99 (0.63,1.34) 2.26 (1.44,3.08) 0.79 (0.50,1.07) RSDR 3.00 (0.00,5.90) 1.10 (0.00,2.16) 2.49 (0.00,4.93) 0.97 (0.00,1.92) 2.14 (0.00,4.25) 0.76 (0.00,1.50) Total economic loss 61.15 (28.00,94.21) 26.99 (12.03,41.93) 60.06 (27.68,92.56) 25.98 (11.54,40.43) 63.61 (29.48,97.98) 24.30 (10.85,37.84) Health terminal 2019 2020 2021 Beijing Tianjin Beijing Tianjin Beijing Tianjin Death AC 29.35 (13.98,45.35) 15.17 (7.23,23.42) 22.47 (10.70,34.74) 16.61 (7.92,25.65) 24.94 (11.87,38.58) 15.16 (7.22,23.44) CCSR 9.22 (2.62,15.58) 5.87 (1.67,9.91) 8.62 (2.45,14.58) 5.62 (1.60,9.49) 8.63 (2.45,14.61) 4.84 (1.38,8.18) RSR 12.57 (7.53,17.53) 4.06 (2.44,5.65) 8.58 (5.13,11.98) 2.73 (1.64,3.80) 7.92 (4.73,11.07) 1.90 (1.14,2.65) Hospitalization CCDR 1.78 (1.13,2.43) 0.80 (0.51,1.08) 1.56 (0.99,2.13) 0.76 (0.48,1.03) 1.28 (0.81,1.74) 0.57 (0.36,0.78) RSDR 1.65 (0.00,3.30) 0.75 (0.00,1.48) 1.41 (0.00,2.82) 0.69 (0.00,1.37) 1.13 (0.00,2.27) 0.51 (0.00,1.02) Total economic loss 54.57 (25.27,84.20) 26.65 (11.85,41.55) 42.64 (19.27,66.24) 26.40 (11.64,41.34) 43.90 (19.86,68.27) 22.98 (10.10,36.07) Table 8 Economic losses caused by ozone pollution (100 million RMB).

PM2.5-related RSDR hospitalizations reduced: 15,871 persons (Table 5 4 8 7 5 4 9 7 As for the economic losses caused by PM 2.5 5 In terms of total economic loss, Beijing is significantly higher than Tianjin, with the loss value remaining at more than 2 times, the main reason may be that the number of exposed population in Beijing is much higher than that in Tianjin. This finding aligns with Wang et al. 6 2.5 2.5 2.5 µg/m 3 40 2.5 17 2.5 2.5 The economic losses caused by ozone pollution are shown in Table 8 10 3 x The total economic losses caused by ozone in Tianjin in each year are 1.885 billion RMB (95% confidence interval: 1.128, 2.636), 3.389 billion RMB (95% confidence interval: 2.042, 4.717), 4.4 billion RMB (95% confidence interval: 2.638, 6.134), 4.98 billion RMB (95% confidence interval: 2.993, 6.936), 4.922 billion RMB. (95% confidence interval: 2.948, 6.87) and 3.984 billion RMB (95% confidence interval: 2.379, 5.575), which is the same trend as that of Beijing. The total economic loss also shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, with a much higher increase range than that of Beijing. For example, in 2017, it increases by 79.77% compared with 2016, but the economic loss in corresponding year is still lower than that of Beijing. And the total economic loss of Beijing in each year is almost twice that of Tianjin, an important reason being that the population exposed to pollutant is less than that of Beijing. The death-related economic loss in Tianjin accounts for more than 98% in each year, even slightly higher than that in Beijing. Therefore, reducing the ozone concentration will reduce the proportion of death-related economic loss in Tianjin more than that in Beijing. In addition, it can be seen from Table 8 Comparing the indirect economic losses caused by not achieving the national air quality first-level concentration limit for PM 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 Conclusions  From 2016 to 2021, the health impacts of reducing PM 2.5 2.5 2.5 35 10 36 2.5 30 2.5 The total economic losses caused by PM 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 3 14 2.5 x 4 Using a Poisson regression relative risk model, this study quantified PM 2.5 2.5 2.5 41 Future directions  This study only considers the impact of pollutant concentration values on the health economic losses, without taking into account the varying spatial distributions of pollutants in different regions. The estimated loss values can only represent the average level within the region. In the next step, we will conduct research that integrates the temporal and spatial distributions of pollutants in order to estimate more accurate economic losses. While this study focuses on Beijing-Tianjin, future work will expand to Hebei Province to address three critical gaps: (a) Contrasting industrial emission profiles to refine the\"pollutant-economic loss elasticity\"framework. (b) Quantifying cross-regional spillovers using atmospheric transport models CMAQ, informed by the EU’s transnational pollution compensation mechanisms 36 Publisher’s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
