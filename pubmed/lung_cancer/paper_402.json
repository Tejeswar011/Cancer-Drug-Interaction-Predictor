Methods This study included patients (≥ 19 years) who met the diagnostic criteria for AE‐IPF. The primary outcome was 30‐day mortality following hospital admission. Data on commonly assessed parameters at the time of emergency room presentation or hospital admission were collected. Variable selection and scoring were performed using the LASSO method and multivariable logistic regression, and the resulting model was validated in an independent cohort. Results The derivation and validation cohorts comprised 128 and 100 patients, respectively. The final model incorporated eight variables (points): age ≥ 69 years (1), smoking status (current smoker: 2, past smoker: 1), use of home oxygen (1), history of hospital admission for non‐AE events within the past 6 months (1), body mass index < 18.5 or > 23 kg/m 2 Conclusion We developed and validated a scoring system based on readily available clinical parameters that effectively stratified 30‐day mortality risk in patients with AE‐IPF, offering a practical tool for bedside prognosis. A scoring system using eight clinical variables was developed and validated to predict 30‐day mortality in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The model showed good performance in both derivation and validation cohorts, providing a practical bedside tool for early risk stratification. clinical respiratory medicine interstitial lung disease pulmonary fibrosis Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute 10.13039/501100003654 RS‐2022‐KE002197 Korea National Institute of Health 10.13039/501100003653 2024ER090500 National Research Foundation of Korea 10.13039/501100003725 NRF‐2022M3A9E4082647 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  J.‐Y.

We included patients who met the following criteria: (a) 19 years of age or older with a diagnosis of IPF, established either previously or at the time of AE‐IPF; (b) satisfied the diagnostic criteria for AE‐IPF [ 4 This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. H‐2002‐161‐1106) and Asan Medical Center (IRB No. 2017‐0915), respectively. The requirement for written informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study design. We report in accordance with the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statements [ 17 2.2 Data Collection and Primary Outcome The primary outcome was death within the first 30 days of admission. We also assessed mortality at 14 days and 3 months as secondary outcomes. Additionally, we analysed in‐hospital mortality and recommendation for intensive care unit (ICU) care, including those who ultimately declined in accordance with their advanced directives. Patients with refractory hypoxemia despite maximal non‐invasive oxygen support, signs of hypercapnic respiratory failure or progressive respiratory distress, haemodynamic instability requiring high‐dose or multiple inotropes, signs of multi‐organ dysfunction including altered consciousness, or other conditions beyond the level of care or monitoring that can be provided in a general ward, were generally recommended for ICU care [ 18 Potential predictors of mortality, measured at the time of emergency room visits or hospital admissions owing to AE‐IPF, were collected. These included: (a) demographic characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and intensity; (b) underlying IPF characteristics, including pulmonary function, CT pattern, gender‐age‐physiology (GAP) index score, use of home oxygen prescribed for patients with moderate‐to‐severe dyspnea and PaO 2 2 2 2 19 2.3 Derivation and Validation of the Scoring System for Predicting 30‐Day Mortality For future usability of the scoring system, we preferentially considered variables that showed a large difference (significant at a value of 0.2) between non‐survivors and survivors, as well as those deemed readily available and reliable in the emergency room. Therefore, we excluded variables such as comorbidities and PaO 2 2 20 λ β Next, we assessed the scoring system's performance with respect to discrimination and prediction ability using Harrell's C‐statistic and the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, respectively [ 21 22 2.4 Statistical Analysis Patient characteristics were summarised as counts and proportions for categorical variables, means and standard deviations (SD) for parametric continuous variables and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for non‐parametric continuous variables. Inter‐cohort differences were compared using the Chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Student's t 2 2 23 α 3 Results 3.1 Patient Characteristics A total of 128 and 100 patients with AE‐IPF were included in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively (Figure 1 p 1 FIGURE 1 Flow diagram of the derivation and validation cohorts.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75–0.93) in the derivation cohort and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71–0.92) in the validation cohort. ROC curves using modified Berlin criteria of acute respiratory syndrome are drawn for the derivation (dashed grey line, AUC 0.68 [95% CI, 0.59–0.78]) and validation (dashed red line, AUC 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59–0.82]) cohorts, respectively. 3.4 Estimated 30‐Day Mortality Using the Scoring System When patients were divided into three risk groups (low: scores 0–3, moderate: scores 4–5, high: ≥ 6) based on the AIM‐30 score, the estimated 30‐day mortality of each group was 0%, 24% and 60% in the derivation cohort, and 2.9%, 21.2% and 59.1% in the validation cohort (Figure 3 S3 S4 FIGURE 3 The Kaplan–Meier survival curve stratified by risk group based on the AIM‐30 score. (A) Derivation cohort. (B) Validation cohort. The dashed (black), solid (red) and dotted (blue) lines refer to low (scores: 0–3 points), moderate (scores: 4–5 points) and high (scores: ≥ 6 points) risk groups. The estimated 30‐day mortality rates of the three risk groups were 0%, 24% and 60% in the derivation cohort and 2.9%, 21.2% and 59.1% in the validation cohort. 4 Discussion In this study, we developed a novel scoring system that predicts the 30‐day mortality of patients with AE‐IPF using eight clinical variables collected at the time of AE‐IPF: age, smoking status, use of home oxygen, non‐AE admission history within 6 months prior to the index AE event, BMI, percentage of lymphocytes, total protein, and lactate levels. The scoring system was developed from a cohort of 128 patients and validated in a separate independent cohort of 100 patients, showing a good discrimination performance. Previously reported potential prognostic factors include the PaO 2 2 16 24 10 14 15 14 16 LCO 14 9 11 15 24 12 13 14 15 24 25 26 12 The AIM‐30 scoring system, on the other hand, employed factors that can be readily queried or are already commonly measured in real‐world practice. It was derived from a relatively large cohort and validated in a separate external cohort. Furthermore, a notable advantage of the AIM‐30 is its immediate applicability in critical settings such as emergency rooms, even in cases where the underlying pulmonary function is unknown or unmeasured. Importantly, AIM‐30 eliminates the need for the complicated scoring of HRCT scans, which has been utilised in previous studies [ 9 11 4 24 Recently, a scoring system called PCR index was developed using P 2 2 C r 27 2 2 27 By implementing the AIM‐30, medical staff can communicate the short‐term prognosis of patients to other staff and patients/family members. This will foster communication regarding the patient's prognosis, facilitate proactive discussions concerning life‐sustaining treatments and advanced care, and expedite necessary preparations. Swift referral of high‐risk patients currently admitted to hospitals lacking lung transplantation or intensive care capabilities to other appropriate medical centres can potentially improve patient outcomes. Moreover, AIM‐30 could serve as a valuable tool for stratifying patients in future clinical trials. The inclusion of multiple variables in the final model highlights the multifactorial nature of mortality in AE‐IPF. Undoubtedly, a patient's baseline IPF status is a crucial determinant, as represented by factors such as age, oxygen therapy requirements, and smoking status. Current smokers may experience persistent oxidative stress and airway inflammation, which can accelerate disease deterioration during AE‐IPF [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 In our study, the use of antifibrotics was not significantly associated with 30‐day mortality. While previous studies have reported that antifibrotic therapy reduces all‐cause mortality and the risk of AE, its impact on short‐term mortality in AE‐IPF remains unclear. A meta‐analysis of 26 studies involving 12,956 patients showed that antifibrotic treatment was associated with a pooled relative risk of 0.55 for all‐cause mortality and 0.63 for AE risk [ 34 This study has several limitations. First, while the patient composition and study duration varied between the two cohorts, both cohorts were derived from tertiary referral centres located in the same metropolitan city and consisted of a single racial group, which may limit the generalisability of the results to other racial or ethnic populations. Validation of our cut‐off levels and score thresholds for risk stratification is needed across more institutions and diverse populations. Second, although we aimed to construct a scoring system using easily accessible and measurable factors, certain elements, such as imaging findings and other serum parameters, were not included in this study. One potentially important factor omitted from the scoring system is the PaO 2 2 8 2 35 36 37 In conclusion, we developed an easily applicable scoring system for predicting 30‐day mortality in patients with AE‐IPF and validated it in an independent cohort. Utilisation of this score will aid in better decision‐making and management of AE‐IPF.
