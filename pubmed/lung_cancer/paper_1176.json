Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy of the digestive tract and ranks fourth worldwide in cancer-related mortality [ 1 2 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Although efforts have been made to cure CRC, mortality rates have been increasing for decades [ 1 2 A novel approach to overcome the disadvantages of chemotherapy consists of screening for functional proteins with anti-CRC effects. Probiotics, including lactic acid bacteria, are human intestinal microbes generally regarded as safe and having a positive impact on human health. Probiotics are monitored systematically during the production of human and animal foods [ 14 15 16 L. plantarum L. rhamnosus L. acidophilus L. casei Bifidobacterium longum B. infantis B. adolescentis B. breve 17 15 Recent studies have focused on the development of novel biotherapeutic drugs based on probiotics. P8, a protein with anti-cancer activity against DLD-1 cells, has been isolated from L. rhamnosus 18 18 19 To determine the mechanism of action (MOA) by which P8 suppressed metastatic activity, proteins in DLD-1 cell lysates that bind to P8 were analyzed by the pull-down method [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 18 19 25 26 27 28 19 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Bacterial Strains and Culture The P8 protein was derived from Lactobacillus rhamnosus Escherichia coli E. coli 2.2. Cell Culture DLD-1, a human colorectal cancer cell line, was purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB; Seoul, Republic of Korea) and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 Matrigel on-top (MoT) culture was performed as previously reported [ 24 2.3. Construction and Purification of Recombinant His-Tagged P8 Protein from E. coli Expression of recombinant P8 protein was achieved using the pET-28a vector containing an N-terminal 6 × His tag and TEV protease cleavage site. The construct was transformed into E. coli 600 2+ 18 2.4. Known-Down of Smad1 in DLD-1 Cells DLD-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 7 × 10 5 29 2.5. Identification of P8-Interacting Partner Proteins from DLD-1 Lysate Recombinant His-tagged P8 protein was overexpressed in E. coli 2+ 19 2+ 19 2.6. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) Assays To evaluate protein–protein interaction by immunoblotting, P8 was incubated with Smad1 (MyBioSource Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) in PBS for 24 h at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-P8 IgG was bound to protein G agarose beads, with excess anti-P8 IgG eluted from the protein G agarose beads with PBS. For immunoprecipitation, each mixture of P8 and Smad1 was applied to anti-P8 IgG immobilized protein G agarose beads; following incubation for 12 h at 4 °C, the unbound proteins were washed out. The beads were boiled in dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-containing sample buffer, followed by separation of the samples via SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transfer to PVDF membranes, and subsequent immunoblotting as previously described. 2.7. Wound Healing Assays DLD-1 cells (wild type and transfectants expressing control or Smad1 shRNA) were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 6 2.8. MoT 3D Cell Culture, Staining, and Confocal Microscopy The formation of filopodia and FLPs was examined using the 3D MoT culture method [ 30 4 ® 2.9. Western Blot Analysis DLD-1 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) were resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in T-TBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). After three washes with T-TBS (15 min each), membranes were exposed for 1 h at 4 °C to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted in blocking solution. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control. Protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), followed by autoradiography using a Chemi-doc™ Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). 2.10. Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed according to established protocols [ 31 Table S1 2.11. Immunocytochemistry Using ImageXpress ® DLD-1 cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h before treatment with P8 (0–40 μM) for an additional 72 h. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 min, and rinsed again. To minimize nonspecific signals, samples were blocked with 4% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-P8 antibody (Young In Frontier Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) or, alternatively, for 2 h at 4 °C with commercial antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology. After washing, protein detection was performed using FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) or Alexa Fluor 568–conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclear staining was carried out with Hoechst 33258 (5 μg/mL; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by PBS washes and mounting. Fluorescence images were acquired with an ImageXpress ® 32 2.12. Cell Proliferation Assay or ImageXpress Live/Dead DLD-1 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 3 2.13. Animals All animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled facility (25 ± 1 °C) under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Kangwon National University (approval no. KW-220401-3, approval on 28 April 2022) and carried out in accordance with institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. NOD-SCID-IL2rg nul 2.14. Splenic Injection and Drug Treatment Female NSG mice (7 weeks old) underwent allograft transplantation. For splenic implantation, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and 1 × 10 6 2.15. Histopathology Mouse liver lobes were fixed in 10% formalin, processed using standard protocols, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 3 μm thickness were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For immunohistochemistry (IHC), paraffin sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval by heating in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 100 °C for 20 min. Immunostaining was performed with ImmPRESS Peroxidase Polymer kits (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were incubated with rabbit anti-P8 primary antibody, followed by peroxidase polymer–conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min. Detection was carried out using ImmPACT DAB substrate (SK-4105; Vector Laboratories), and nuclei were counterstained with Meyer’s hematoxylin for 10 s. Negative controls were prepared by substituting the primary antibody with diluent. To evaluate metastatic burden, H&E-stained liver sections were scanned with a Pannoramic SCAN slide scanner (3D HISTECH, Budapest, Hungary), and all lobes were analyzed for the number and size of metastatic foci using Case Viewer software (version 2.3; 3D HISTECH). 2.16. Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism version 4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), and p 3. Results 3.1. Anti-Cancer Properties of P8 Against DLD-1 Cells Investigation of the anti-cancer properties of P8 showed that P8 reduced the proliferation and migration of DLD-1 cells ( Figure 1 Figure 1 18 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. Anti-Metastatic Target of P8 in DLD-1 Cells In the recent P8 study, we have conducted a P8 target discovery experiment [ 19 2+ 2+ Figure 2 Table 1 Figure 2 3.3. P8-Associated Anti-Migration and Anti-Adhesion Signaling Pathways in DLD-1 Cells Smad1 was shown to be highly expressed in CRC tissues, suggesting that Smad1 potentiated CRC cell migration [ 33 34 35 36 37 38 Figure 3 39 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 4 18 19 Figure 4 Figure S1 40 41 3.4. Smad1 Dependent Anti-Metastatic Activity of P8 To confirm the role of Smad1 in P8-associated anti-metastatic activity, the susceptibility of DLD-1 cells to P8 following knockdown of Smad1 with specific shRNA was evaluated. Transfection of the specific Smad1 shRNA resulted in the successful generation of a ∆Smad1 cell line with a phenotype deficient in Smad1 ( Figure 5 Figure 5 3.5. P8-Induced Changes in Anti-Metastatic Morphology on CRC Surfaces Cell migration relies on filopodia, which are formed of parallel actin filaments [ 42 43 Figure 6 Figure 6 44 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 7 3.6. P8-Induced Changes in Anti-Metastatic Morphology on CRC Spheroid Surfaces Increasing attention has been directed toward filopodia and filopodium-like protrusions (FLPs) in cancer research [ 45 46 47 48 To further assess the metastatic characteristics in tumor cells, the formation of FLPs was analyzed by microscopic evaluation of P8-derived morphological suppression using the MoT 3D culture method [ 49 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 3.7. Anti-Metastatic Effects of P8 in a Mouse Model of CRC Metastasis (Splenic Injection Model) Taken together, these in vitro results showed that P8 strongly inhibited CRC migration and cell adhesion at both the cellular and molecular levels. The ability of P8 to successfully prevent CRC metastasis in vivo was analyzed using a mouse model of liver metastasis ( Figure S2 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 10 Figure 4 Figure 10 18 19 Figure 4 4. Discussion CRC represents the third most frequent cause of cancer-associated death worldwide, with nearly 56% of patients succumbing to the disease [ 50 51 52 53 54 55 P8, which has been isolated from the probiotic L. rhamnosus 18 19 Pediococcus pentosaceus P. pentosaceus P. pentosaceus 18 28 2 18 19 28 19 The present study found that P8 has strong potential as an anti-metastatic drug for CRC. Anti-migration and anti-spheroid formation assays suggested that the anti-metastatic activity of P8 was due to the close association of cell migration and cell–cell adhesion properties with the generation of new metastatic foci in other organs. To understand its anti-metastasis MOA, P8-interacting target proteins in CRC cells were isolated using a P8 pull-down method, a powerful in vitro profiling tool for identifying unknown interacting partners [ 20 21 56 57 20 21 Pull-down of putative anti-cancer targets using His-tagged P8 enabled subsequent identification of candidate proteins by LC-MS/MS. P8 was found to interact with Smad1, a transcriptional modulator of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) signal pathway activated by BMP2 and TNF-α that plays important roles in cell invasion and metastasis [ 34 35 58 59 60 61 62 63 63 33 35 64 Our findings provide the first evidence that P8 can interfere with the phosphorylation of Smad1 and related complexes (Smad1/5, Smad1/5/8), which is required for their activation, even though Smad1 expression itself was modestly increased. This P8-associated inactivation of Smad1 effectively suppressed the migration of CRC cells by reducing the levels of expression of Snail, Slug, Twist, and ZEB1. Because suppression or reduction in EMT should generally increase the levels of cell–cell adhesion factors [ 33 65 66 67 Migration of existing cancer cells is critical for the formation of new metastatic foci. Filopodia are thin cylindrical extensions of the cell membrane that are filled with long actin filaments organized as a tight bundle with their growing ends pointing toward the direction of protrusion [ 23 68 69 22 Filopodia-like structures in vivo, growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and BMPs induce FLPs in cells at the endothelial tip, leading to sprout invasion of the surrounding ECM [ 70 71 24 23 43 72 73 As a critical regulator of filopodia, myosin X is elevated in breast cancer, and its expression correlates with poor prognosis [ 74 75 76 74 74 75 74 77 78 79 Cancer cells that have extravasated into the lungs of mice following tail vein injection have been found to display FLPs. These protrusions harbor tip complexes along their shafts, and their formation is regulated by myosin X, Rho family GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rif, formins, and focal adhesion regulators [ 24 5. Conclusions Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo findings indicate that P8 has anti-metastatic properties. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide evidence about the P8-Smad1-EMT regulatory network or cell adhesion axis in CRC metastasis, suggesting that P8 is a potential new biotherapeutic agent and Smad1 is a potential prognostic factor for CRC metastasis [ 29 Pediococcus pentosaceus 27 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms13092175/s1 6 Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.R.; data curation, J.H., S.-H.S., J.W.P. and Y.R.; formal analysis, S.K. and S.-H.S.; investigation, S.K. and J.H.; methodology, J.H. and S.-H.S.; supervision, B.C.A. and M.J.C.; validation, S.K.; writing—original draft, B.C.A.; writing—review and editing, B.C.A. and J.W.P.
