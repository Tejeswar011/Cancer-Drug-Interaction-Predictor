This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic complementarity of the in‐house sequencing platform Rapid‐Neo. We retrospectively analyzed 110 patients with thoracic malignancies who underwent Rapid‐Neo testing. The baseline characteristics, sequencing results, concordance with companion diagnostics (CDx), and clinical outcomes were assessed. Of 110 patients, 100 (90.9%) had primary lung cancer. Rapid‐Neo identified at least one genomic alteration in 99.1% of cases and well‐established driver alterations in 66.0% of lung cancer cases. TMB‐high and MSI‐high statuses were observed in 9.0% and 2.0% of cases, respectively. Among the 90 cases with prior CDx, Rapid‐Neo identified driver alterations in 10.0% of the cases, including EGFR KRAS MET RET ERBB2 p We clarified the utility and challenges of in‐house comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) testing in lung cancer care. companion dianostics driver oncogene genomic profiling lung cancer TMB Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development 10.13039/100009619 JP23ck0106872 JP24ck0106872 Japan Society for the Promotion of Science 10.13039/501100001691 25K11461 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Funding: Abbreviations CDx companion diagnostics CGP comprehensive genomic profiling FFPE formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded HR hazard ratio ICI immune checkpoint inhibitors MSI microsatellite instability NGS next‐generation sequencing NSCLC non‐small cell lung cancer PFS progression‐free survival TMB tumor mutation burden 1 Introduction Cancer remains a major global health challenge, particularly in aging societies, such as Japan. In 2019, lung cancer caused 53,200 deaths in men, ranking first among all cancer types, and 22,300 deaths in women, ranking second [ 1 2 3 Despite its significance, the routine application of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in clinical practice remains limited. In Japan, CGP has been covered by the national health insurance system since June 2019 [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 5 19 20 To address these challenges, we developed an in‐house CGP system, Rapid‐Neo, at the Keio University Hospital. This system was designed to accelerate the detection of actionable genomic alterations and facilitate the integration of genomic data into real‐world clinical decision‐making. Although CGP implementation is expanding globally, published reports on the clinical performance and utility of in‐house CGP systems remain scarce. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the performance of Rapid‐Neo in clinical practice, with a primary focus on its diagnostic complementarity in detecting driver alterations missed by initial companion diagnostic (CDx) tests. These missed alterations were attributable to limitations such as insufficient gene or variant coverage or test failure. In addition, we evaluated the concordance between the Rapid‐Neo and CDx results, including not only initial CDx but also additional CDx assays, such as CGP tests performed in selected cases. Rapid‐Neo also provides additional information by capturing genomic features that are not detected by the small‐panel multiplex assays including the Oncomine DX Target Test, the most commonly used assay in Japan. Additional information included tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and a range of genomic biomarkers associated with immunotherapy response. Based on this extended profiling capability, we examined the prognostic significance of TMB in lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR ARID1A ARID2 PBRM1 STK11 KEAP1 PTEN 21 22 23 24 25 2 Material and Methods 2.1 Study Design and Ethical Considerations Keio University Hospital is a designated core cancer genomic medicine hospital with a history of implementing in‐house CGP systems. Under a hospital‐approved protocol (Keio University Ethics Committee Nos. 20200046 and 20231104), we performed a retrospective observational study of patients who received Rapid‐Neo testing for thoracic malignancies (including lung cancer, mesothelioma, thymic carcinoma, and others) between January 2022 and July 2024. All samples were obtained as part of daily clinical care, with written informed consent for genomic testing, supplemented by an opt‐out process for retrospective analyses. 2.2 Rapid‐Neo Clinical Sequencing System We launched Rapid‐Neo version 1.0 in January 2022, using a next‐generation sequencing (NGS) panel targeting 145 cancer‐related genes (single‐nucleotide variants, indels, copy number alterations, and 11 fusion genes) [ 26 27 28 S1 http://genomejack.net/ 2.3 Analytical Approach We retrospectively analyzed 114 Rapid‐Neo tests conducted on 110 patients with thoracic malignancies between January 2022 and July 2024. For each case, we reviewed whether CDx testing was performed, including the initial CDx before first‐line therapy and any additional CDx, such as CGP, after standard treatments. When CDx was performed, the modality and reported driver gene alterations were retrospectively extracted from the medical records. Using these data, we compared the detection rates and concordance of the well‐established driver alterations between CDx and Rapid‐Neo. In addition, for the selected patient subgroups, we assessed the clinical relevance of the genomic findings. These included patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring major EGFR 2.4 Statistical Analysis Patient characteristics are summarized as medians and ranges for continuous variables and as numbers with percentages for categorical variables. For the subgroup of patients with EGFR EGFR TP53 p 3 Results 3.1 Patient Characteristics A total of 110 thoracic malignancy cases underwent Rapid‐Neo testing, of which 100 (90.9%) had primary lung cancer and 10 (9.1%) had other thoracic tumors (e.g., mesothelioma, thymic carcinoma, and carcinoma of unknown primary origin).

Eighty‐seven cases had either stage IV disease or recurrence after curative therapy, and 81 patients underwent Rapid‐Neo testing before the second‐line treatment. Surgical specimens are the most common sample type used for Rapid‐Neo sequencing, which helps ensure sufficient tissue quantity for genomic analysis. Ninety‐two patients had undergone CDx testing, most commonly with the Oncomine DX Target Test (67 cases). Additionally, CGP testing under national insurance coverage was performed in five cases: four with the FoundationOne CDx and one with the GenMine TOP. 3.2 Genomic Profiling Results Across All Rapid‐Neo Tests In total, 114 Rapid‐Neo tests were performed on 110 patients, including a few who underwent repeated testing. The median turnaround time (TAT) for the Rapid‐Neo test was 29 days.

From the outermost to innermost ring, the layers represent the concordance or discordance between CDx and Rapid‐Neo, CDx agent used, and driver gene alterations detected by CDx. The categories represented by each color in the pie chart are detailed in the figure legend. The three discordant cases included all patients with lung cancer. One involved an ROS1 KRAS MET These findings collectively demonstrated that Rapid‐Neo exhibited high concordance with CDx, showing consistent results in 96.8% of the CDx‐tested cases, regardless of whether a driver alteration was present or absent. Among the 95 patients who underwent both tests, only one case (1.1%) involving ROS1 fusion was discordant and was not detected by Rapid‐Neo. This high level of agreement supports the reliability of Rapid‐Neo as a clinical genomic‐testing platform. 3.5 Prognostic Implications for Targeted Therapy Next, we assessed whether TMB measured using Rapid‐Neo could predict the outcomes of EGFR EGFR 3 TP53 p p TABLE 3 Comparison of patient characteristics by TMB groups in EGFR TMB < 3.7 ( N TMB ≥ 3.7 ( N  p Median age (range), years 64 (28, 84) 66 (41, 82) 0.97 Female 7 (50.0%) 11 (68.8%) 0.46 Never smoker 7 (50.0%) 9 (60.0%) 0.72  EGFR 0.06 L858R 9 (64.3%) 4 (25.0%) Exon19 deletion 5 (35.7%) 12 (75.0%)  EGFR 2 (14.3%) 1 (6.3%) 0.59 TP53 status 0.009 Mutated 4 (28.6%) 13 (81.3%) Wild 10 (71.4%) 3 (18.8%) Median TMB (range), mutations/Mb 2.2 (1.1, 3.3) 4.25 (3.7, 7.0) < 0.0001 EGFR‐TKI used Osimertinib 14 (100%) 16 (100%) — Afatinib 1 (7.1%) 1 (6.3%) 1.00 Erlotinib 0 (0.0%) 2 (12.5%) 0.49 Gefitinib 0 (0.0%) 3 (18.8%) 0.23 Treatment line of EGFR‐TKI initiation 0.47 First line 13 (92.9%) 16 (100%) Second line 1 (7.1%) 0 (0.0%) PFS under EGFR‐TKI group was significantly shorter than that in the low‐TMB group (hazard ratio = 2.58, log‐rank p 3 EGFR TP53 p 4 FIGURE 3 Kaplan–Meier curves showing progression‐free survival (PFS) in patients with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation who required systemic chemotherapy.

Our in‐house system, Rapid‐Neo, demonstrated both high analytical reliability and a major strength in the ability to complement initial CDx, as evidenced by the findings of this study. Rapid‐Neo achieved a 96.8% concordance rate with the CDx results and provided an additional 10.0% diagnostic yield for driver gene alterations that were not detected by the initial CDx. Notably, even when compared to the Oncomine DX Target Test, a small‐panel assay widely used across Japan and the most commonly used initial CDx at our institution, Rapid‐Neo identified additional driver alterations in 6.2% of cases. Many of these alterations involved genes or specific variants that were not covered by the CDx platform, underscoring the limitations of the panel content and technical sensitivity. These findings emphasize the clinical significance of performing CGP, even in patients with negative results in small‐panel assays, because such testing can reveal clinically actionable alterations that may guide molecularly targeted therapies. Furthermore, Rapid‐Neo enables the simultaneous assessment of TMB, MSI, and multiple genomic biomarkers that are either established or emerging as predictors of therapeutic response to agents such as EGFR‐TKIs and ICIs, which are features that are not typically evaluated by small‐panel assays. In our exploratory analyses, these genomic features demonstrate potential clinical relevance. Consistent with previous reports [ 32 32 33 Similarly, previously reported ICI‐related biomarkers, including high TMB, high MSI, and alterations in ARID1A ARID2 PBRM1 STK11 KEAP1 PTEN 21 22 23 24 25 From a systems perspective, the implementation of Rapid‐Neo contributed to the early and broad integration of the CGP within our institution. As discussed later as one of its limitations, Rapid‐Neo lacks a companion diagnostic function; however, it can be performed at any point during the clinical course. This accessibility lowers the threshold for physicians to order testing and may encourage the broader utilization of genomic profiling. Therefore, Rapid‐Neo serves not only as a diagnostic tool but also as a gateway for subsequent CGP testing. Since the launch of Rapid‐Neo, the number of CGP tests submitted under the national insurance system in our department has steadily increased (Figure S3 However, a notable limitation is the detection of certain RNA‐level fusion genes using DNA‐based approaches. Optimization with RNA‐based sequencing or sensitive methodologies could further improve the detection rate of gene fusions, such as ROS1. Another limitation is that the test is frequently performed on surgical specimens because of the need to consider the volume of the remaining specimen. Optimizing the specimen extraction method may help minimize specimen loss. Although the Rapid‐Neo test offers high usability, its lack of a companion function necessitates careful consideration when applied to cases with limited remaining specimens. Specifically, if the entire specimen is used for rapid Neo testing, additional companion diagnostic tests may no longer be feasible. Therefore, appropriate case selection is essential. Taken together, these findings support the feasibility and added value of Rapid‐Neo as a reliable and informative in‐house CGP platform that aligns with and enhances the conventional diagnostic workflow. By enabling early and expanded access to actionable genomic data, Rapid‐Neo has the potential to improve clinical decision‐making, facilitate timely therapy selection, and foster the broad adoption of CGP in real‐world clinical settings. Although the in‐house nature of Rapid‐Neo imposes certain limitations, we believe that it allows for greater flexibility in adapting the panel design to incorporate emerging biomarkers and newly approved therapeutic targets. As such, we consider the routine use of in‐house CGP in daily clinical practice to be a necessary and justifiable investment for maintaining high‐quality personalized cancer care. In this retrospective study, the in‐house CGP system Rapid‐Neo demonstrated high concordance with CDx tests and showed added diagnostic value by identifying driver gene alterations that were missed by initial small‐panel CDx, including the widely used Oncomine DX Target Test. It also provides additional genomic insights into biomarkers such as TMB, MSI, and immune‐related alterations that are not captured by conventional small‐panel assays. The implementation of an in‐house CGP system can mitigate delays, expand CGP testing to earlier lines of therapy, and refine treatment decisions based on detailed genomic data. Large prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and optimize the CGP workflow for routine clinical practice.
