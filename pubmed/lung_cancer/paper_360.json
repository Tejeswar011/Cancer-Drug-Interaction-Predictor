Methods Retraction Watch database was used to identify papers retracted due to originating from paper mills and journals, between January 2020 and December 2022. Data on the total number of articles and journal characteristics were obtained from Web of Science and Journal Citation Reports. Journals were classified based on the frequency of retracted paper mill papers (1, 2–9, ≥ 10 retractions). Logistic regressions were conducted to explore associations between retraction frequency and journal characteristics. Results One hundred forty-two journals were identified that retracted 2,051 articles from paper mills. Among these, 71 (50%) journals had 1 retraction, 36 (25.4%) had 2–9 retractions, and 35 (24.6%) had ≥ 10 retractions; 4 (2.8%) journals had > 100 retractions. These journals, regardless of paper mill retraction number, were mainly in the second (35.2%) and third (29.6%) quartiles by impact factor. Medicine and health emerged as the predominant subject area, comprising 61.2% of all indexed journal categories. Comparing journals with one retraction to those with ten or more, the proportion of open access articles (72.6% vs. 19.2%) and median editorial times (86 vs. 116 days) differed across groups, although these differences were not statistically significant. An inverse correlation was observed between the proportion of paper mill papers and original articles (Spearman’s Rho = –0.1891, 95%CI -0.370 to -0.008). Logistic regressions found no significant association between paper mill retraction number and other variables. Conclusion This study suggests that paper mill retractions are concentrated in a small number of journals with common characteristics: high open access rates, intermediate impact factor quartiles, a high volume of citable items, and classification in medicine and health categories. Short editorial times may indicate a higher presence of paper mill publications, but more research is needed to examine this factor in depth, as well as the possible influence of acceptance rates.

In recent years, however, this has been threatened by the surge in so-called “paper mills”, organizations devoted to mass production of fraudulent or plagiarized scientific papers, then sold to researchers to publish under their names [ 1 2 1 3 4 5 7 Some of the greatest damage caused by these organizations is generated when false research infiltrates the research enterprise, such as by being aggregated into systematic reviews and meta-analyses, falsifying scientific evidence and potentially affecting clinical practice. This amounts to a waste of time and valuable resources, induces dangers for public health and medicine, and can even put the lives of patients at risk [ 8 10 3 11 13 1 Previous investigations have identified certain characteristics related to paper mills [ 14 Methods This paper reports on a cross-sectional study conducted to investigate journals that retracted at least one paper originating from paper mills. We included all journals that had at least one paper mill paper retracted over the period January 1 st, 2020, through December 31 st, 2022. Corrections, expressions of concern, and communications to conferences were excluded. We used the Retraction Watch database to identify retracted paper mill papers and the journals in which they were published (last access to the database January 23rd, 2023). A number of journal characteristics were collected as follows. First, the total number of papers published by each journal from 2020 through 2022 was extracted from Web of Science. Next, the following information was sourced from Journal Citation Reports (JCR): total of citable items; journal impact factor (JIF); quartile (Q); percentage of papers published by the journal, with respect to the total of citable items; percentage of publications in open access; and the JCR categories of each journal. Because the journals possessed more than one category, we recorded all categories belonging to the journals analyzed: the JIF and quartile selected were the most favorable one of the categories. The date of the last search of the JCR database was October 21, 2023. Finally, official journal websites were searched to obtain information on the country, publisher, total number of editors (excluding senior and honorary editors), editorial times (from submission until first and second editorial decisions), and acceptance rate. These data are reported by the journals themselves. Statistical analysis The journals included were classified into three groups based on the number of retracted paper mill papers that they published over the period analysed, using the 50th and 75th percentiles of the entire sample as cut-off points. Journals that had published only one retracted paper mill paper were classified in Group 1, journals with between 2 and 9 papers in Group 2, and those with 10 or more papers in Group 3. First, we performed a descriptive analysis of the journals, divided into groups according to the following qualitative variables: publisher, country, quartile and category. For each variable, we recorded the number of journals and the number of retracted paper mill papers published. Additionally, a descriptive analysis of the journals categorised by group was performed for the following quantitative variables: number of paper mill articles; total citable articles; percentage of open access; JIF; number of JCR subject categories assigned to the journal; percentage of articles out of the total citable articles; and number of editors. For each of the quantitative variables, the median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum values were obtained according to the group. Quantitative variables were compared between groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA), while qualitative variables were compared using the chi-square test. Where differences were indicated by overall comparisons between the three groups, multiple comparison analyses were conducted between pairs of groups using the Bonferroni correction. The descriptive analysis was replicated in the 20 journals with the most retracted paper mill papers. The correlation between the quantitative variables and the percentage of retracted paper mill papers was assessed. To generate the percentage of retracted paper mill papers for each analyzed journal, the variable ‘number of retracted paper mill papers’ was standardized by dividing it by the total number of citable articles published by each journal. This variable gives the proportion of paper mill papers in a journal out of the total number of citable articles published by that journal. Citable articles, also called citable items, are used to calculate the JCR impact factor and include original articles and reviews. This variable facilitates the assessment of the relative magnitude of paper mill penetration in the analysed journals. The Spearman’s Rho is presented for each comparison, along with the 95% confidence interval and the p-value. An ordinal logistic regression model was performed to examine the relationship between the dependent variable (Group, with three ordered levels) and several independent variables. This approach allowed us to identify whether the independent variables were associated with the likelihood of a journal being classified in Groups 1, 2 or 3. Due to multicollinearity among the independent variables, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to identify combinations of variables that explained the largest variance in the data. Those components with eigenvalues equal or greater than 1 were included. The included independent variables were the total of citable items, JIF, percentage of original papers published by the journal and number of JCR categories. Additionally, a binary logistic regression was performed. To do this, the variable ‘Group’ was recategorized into a dichotomous variable with a cut-off point set at ≥ 10 retracted paper mill papers. The dependent variable was the dichotomous variable (having published < 10 paper mill papers / ≥ 10 paper mill papers) and the independent variables were the total of citable items, JIF, percentage of original papers published by the journal and number of JCR categories. All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA v.16 software package. Statistical significance was set at a p Due to the nature of the study, no ethics committee approval was required. Results Description of journals categorized by group The study included 2,051 papers retracted for originating from paper mills from January 1 st, 2020, through December 31 st, 2022, published in 142 different journals. Of these, 71 journals (50.0%) were classified in Group 1, 36 (25.4%) in Group 2, and 35 (24.6%) in Group 3. A total of 93.7% were indexed in JCR; the 9 unindexed journals were registered as missing values, with one belonging to Group 1 (1 retracted paper mill paper), three to Group 2 (2–9 retracted paper mill papers), and the remaining five to Group 3 (10 or more retracted paper mill papers). Group 3 contained most retractions (89.4%). Among all the indexed journals included, journals most commonly were based in the United States (USA) (Supplementary Table 1), with a total of 42 journals (29.6%), followed by the United Kingdom, with 35 (24.6%).

Discussion Main findings The results of this paper suggest that retracted paper mill papers tend to be grouped within a small number of journals. These journals are typically in intermediate quartiles, are mostly open access, and have an inverse correlation with the percentage of original articles published (i.e. the fewer original articles a journal publishes, the more paper mill retractions it has). Four journals were identified that were particularly implicated, with over 100 retracted paper mill papers in a period of three years: Journal of Physics: Conference Series, European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences, Journal of Cellular Biochemistry International Journal of Electrical Engineering and Education The findings of this study indicate that most journals impacted by paper mill papers are from the United Kingdom and the USA and associated with a limited group of publishers, including Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley. These publishers have responded to calls from the Committee on Publishing Ethics (COPE), which has urged the academic publishing community to take coordinated action against paper mills. In response, they have introduced measures to detect problems in their manuscripts, such as training for editors or investing in suspicious-paper detection systems [ 11 15 18 18 20 Our results are in line with previous research and confirm that journals with retracted paper mill papers are predominantly linked to the field of health sciences [ 1 8 10 21 Previous studies, such as that by Pérez-Neri et al. [ 10 16 17 22 23 The analysis by group suggests an accumulation of paper mill-related retractions in open access journals, though the publishing model does not seem to be a related factor. Even so, journals, known as predatory (those which prioritize profit over scientific quality by publishing low-standard content) have arisen in the last decades, taking advantage of the open access model [ 24 28 Special numbers are particularly vulnerable to paper mill papers because they are edited and published separately from the regular journal, usually by guest editors [ 15 29 Although some studies suggest that a small number of editors may be representative of non- ethical practices [ 30 15 15 29 Lastly, the data gathered could suggest a possible reduction in editorial times in the group with the highest number of retractions, indicating that these journals would be opting for swifter editorial processes and a potential dubious review processes [ 25 30 Advantages and limitations This study has a series of limitations. Firstly, it was only possible to include formally retracted paper mill papers, which may underestimate the magnitude of the problem and complicate the identification of associations. We acknowledge that the results of our study may not accurately reflect the actual scope of the phenomenon, as they depend directly on how scientific journals decide and manage to retract articles that have been identified as coming from paper mills. In other words, our findings are conditioned by the current state of retractions, which represents a partial and dynamic snapshot of a broader and evolving situation. Since many journals may still have fraudulent articles published that have not yet been detected, our results should be interpreted as provisional. These results may change as new detection tools are implemented and as journals continue their internal investigations. Nonetheless, and precisely because of the dynamic nature of the phenomenon, we believe it is important to describe what is currently known. Therefore, studying the characteristics of the journals affected with the data available at this moment is relevant and necessary. Understanding the profile of the journals that have been targeted by these fraudulent practices allows us to identify patterns of vulnerability, generate hypotheses, and guide editorial policies and preventive mechanisms—even with the understanding that this portrayal is necessarily incomplete. Having a characterization, although subject to future revision, is preferable to inaction or to waiting for a perfect picture that we may never have. Secondly, the content obtained from the JCR database may be biased due to the deindexation of journals which do not comply with ethical standards, underrepresented journals with a greater record of retractions. Furthermore, data relating to editorial times and the total number of editors are reported by the journals themselves, which could introduce inherent biases due to the omission of data and lack of independent verification. Thirdly, while we acknowledge that the Retraction Watch database may contain omissions or errors due to limitations inherent to its data collection methodology—for instance, its reliance on public reports and the lack of systematic practices in some editorial sources—we consider it, at present, to be the most comprehensive, accessible, and rigorous source available for systematically studying the phenomenon of retractions related to paper mills. Retraction Watch uses a variety of data sources to ascertain the reasons for retraction of the papers included in their database, including editorials, direct communication with journal editors, PubPeer commentaries, and investigations conducted by external experts. While we consider this approach to be the most robust currently available for identifying paper mill-related retractions, it remains possible that some studies were misclassified—either by being incorrectly labeled as paper mill products or by not being identified as such when they should have been. We also acknowledge that Retraction Watch might not be the best source to analyze in depth the characteristics of paper mill retractions, but we are not aware of a better source of information for this. Furthermore, this study lacks a control group, which limits its capacity to make significant comparisons and establish solid conclusions about the distinctive characteristics. Future studies should consider the inclusion of a control group to evaluate whether characteristics differ. Additionally, the study would be enriched by a differentiated analysis of predatory journals to better understand their impact on the results. However, there is no objective and universally accepted tool to distinguish and classify journals as predatory or not. The problem is compounded by the possible lack of motivation of these journals to retract articles originating from paper mills, which means that certain journals are likely underrepresented in our dataset and may affect the results obtained. Finally, the study period of two years, with a minimum of 12 months after retraction, might be insufficient for the inclusion and follow-up of all retractions. The inclusion of a greater number of years would increase the robustness of the associations observed. With respect to the advantages of the study, on the one hand, the use of acknowledged, comprehensive data source, such as Retraction Watch, enables all retractions to be systematically included. Along with this, the use of JCR for gathering most of the study data ensures a solid basis for analysis. To our knowledge, previous studies have not exhaustively analyzed as many journal-related variables. Similarly, the use of a wide range of journals and their categorization into groups makes it possible to study differential characteristics by reference to paper mill penetration. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has conducted an analysis of this nature, which suggests a novel contribution that may prove useful for future research. Conclusions The study reveals that retracted paper mill papers are concentrated in a small number of journals with certain common characteristics and suggests an inverse correlation between retractions and the percentage of original papers published. No evidence was found to show that the size of the editorial team might affect retractions. Editorial decision times should be investigated as a possible indicator of journals prone to retract papers. The results of this study provide a clear, detailed picture of the characteristics of journals affected by the problem of paper mills, and knowing these may be fundamental to improve the evaluation processes of journals and guide researchers in the selection of appropriate journals for submitting papers, thereby ensuring the integrity and quality of academic literature.
