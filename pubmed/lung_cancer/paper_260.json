Inflammatory mediators, hypoxia, hyperglycaemia and cancer stimulate its secretion. Particularly in sepsis, high Ang-2 levels appear to be a prognostic marker for morbidity and mortality in the critically ill. As an important trigger for endothelial damage one therapeutic option in these patients might be the removal of Ang-2. The Cyto-SOLVE trial included patients with septic shock or rhabdomyolsis treated with the adsorber Cytosorb (CS) (included in continuous kidney replacement therapy) for the removal of cytokines and myoglobin. Ang-2 was measured in the patient´s blood and pre- and post-CS at defined time points (ten minutes, one, three, six, and twelve hours after initiation). Ang-2 extracorporeal clearances (ml/min) were calculated with: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:\\left(bloodflow*\\left(1-hematocrit\\right)\\right)*\\left(\\frac{concentration\\:\\left(pre-post\\right)}{concentration\\:\\left(pre\\right)}\\right).$$\\end{document} U p Keywords Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) Endothelial dysfunction Sepsis Rhabdomyolysis Cytosorb Subject terms Medical research Nephrology Klinikum der Universität München (6933) Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) belongs to a family of growth factors (Angiopoietin-1–4) and is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 57–70 kDa, depending on its glycosylation and present molecular structure 1 3 4 5 6 1 4 Since inflammatory mediators, hypoxia, hyperglycemia, and cancer stimulate the rapid autocrine secretion of Ang-2, several diseases are associated with high levels of Ang-2 4 7 8 9 8 10 13 Furthermore, patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) with and without sepsis develop high levels of Ang-2 14 16 17 18 19 Due to the high clinical relevance, the angiopoietin/tie-pathway became an interesting point of application for several therapeutic approaches 20 21 22 23 24 The cytokine adsorber Cytosorb (CS), which eliminates molecules up to a size of 60 kDa and is approved for the removal of cytokines, bilirubin, myoglobin, ticagrelor and rivaroxaban, is widely used for these indications 25 26 27 28 Methods Study setting This was a post-hoc analysis of a single-center, prospective, observational trial including patients with Cytosorb application for the adsorption of cytokines in patients with septic shock or the adsorption of myoglobin in patients with severe rhabdomyolysis. The patients were included between May 2021 and April 2023 during their stay at two intensive care units (ICU) at the LMU hospital in Munich. The local institutional review board approved the study (registration number 21-0236). The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04913298 Study population Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with the need for continuous RRT due to anuric/oliguric acute kidney injury, diagnosed according to the KDIGO consensus criteria, and CS-application, were included. In addition, patients had to be diagnosed with septic shock combined with hyperinflammation marked out by an IL-6 concentration > 500 pg/ml in patients´ blood or severe rhabdomyolysis with plasma myoglobin levels > 5000 ng/ml as there is no general definiton of rhabdomyolysis. As mentioned above, the exclusion criterion was no consent from the patient or their legal representatives to participate in the study. The indication of CS application was at the discretion of the attending physician and independent of the study. Blood sampling CS was installed post-dialyzer into the Fresenius MultiFiltrate circuit (MultiFiltrate CVVHD (Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis/hemodiafiltration) CiCa ® ® ® ® Laboratory measurements The laboratory parameters myoglobin and IL-6 were measured in plasma using the standard clinical chemistry modular analyzer Cobas ® ™ Data collection For data evaluation, demographic data and clinical data as well as laboratory variables were collected from the laboratory and patient information system. Laboratory parameters like CRP, creatinine, urea, total bilirubin, LDH, myoglobin and IL-6, were measured shortly before CS initiation in the clinical routine.

A p p Results Demographic and clinical data A total of 26 patients were included in the study. The indication for CS treatment was septic shock with hyperinflammation (34.6%) or rhabdomyolysis (65.4%). The main diagnosis that led to admission to the ICU were diverse. In descending order in patients with septic shock: sepsis (44.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (22.2%), one patient after liver transplantation, one patient with intestinal ischemia and one patient after resuscitation. In descending order in patients with rhabdomyolysis: liver or lung transplantation (29.4%), ARDS (29.4%), major vascular surgery (17.6%), one patient with polytrauma, one patient after resuscitation and one patient with pericardial tamponade. The majority of the patients (77%) were already undergoing dialysis before the start of CS (66.6% of the patients with sepsis, 87.5% of the patients with rhabdomyolysis). There was no death during the sampling period. In six patients the treatment with CS had to be interrupted before the end of the 12 h period due to a blocked filter ( n n n 92.3% of the study population still required dialysis 28 days after CS treatment or until death.

Its association with several diseases as a biomarker and as a potential therapeutic approach has become increasingly important 3 23 29 32 3 29 32 33 It has been demonstrated that high Ang-2 concentrations are associated with capillary leakage, frequently observed in patients with sepsis and septic shock 28 9 11 14 9 13 16 29 A significantly lower fluid balance on the day following CS suggests a lower volume requirement for the patients. Ang-2 has been demonstrated to lead to endothelial disruption and increased vascular permeability. Consequently, the removal of Ang-2 could potentially lead to improved hemodynamic stabilization 3 28 We analyzed two subgroups based on the indication for CS therapy: septic shock and rhabdomyolysis. Comparing these groups, there was no significant difference between the initial Ang-2 concentrations. In contrast, patients with septic shock had higher norepinephrine doses and higher volume requirements, reflected by a higher fluid balance before and during CS therapy. Although both conditions allow for the administration of fluids, aggressive fluid resuscitation is crucial in septic shock, especially in the first hours 34 35 28 29 Patients with rhabdomyolysis exhibited Ang-2 levels that were statistically equivalent to those observed in patients with septic shock. To date, no such association between Ang-2 and rhabdomyolysis has been described in the literature. Nevertheless, severe rhabdomyolysis in critically ill patients can also result in vasoplegia and capillary leakage, which may be associated with elevated Ang-2 concentrations 31 10 11 15 17 30 36 37 In conclusion, the CS adsorber cannot effectively remove Ang-2 and is therefore unsuitable for its removal from the body. Whether the reduced positive balance in patients after CS use is due to the adsorber itself or to other causal and supportive therapies cannot be answered within the scope of this study. Our data indicate that severe rhabdomyolysis is also associated with high Ang-2 concentrations. As all patients require dialysis, it would be beneficial in the future to evaluate patients with rhabdomyolysis without acute kidney injury and in particular renal replacement therapy. This post-hoc analysis is subject to several limitations. Firstly, the number of patients included is relatively small. However, the primary question of the adsorption capacity can be answered with a high degree of reliability using this number of patients. Secondly, both CVVHD and CVVHDF were used as dialysis modalities, yet this should have no impact on the Ang-2 elimination of CS itself as the samples were collected right before and after CS. Furthermore, as there was no change in the plasma concentrations of Ang-2, the different dialysis modalities should not impact the clearance of Ang-2. Thirdly, Ang-2 concentrations were only measured over a period of 12 h, with no long-term data available. This is a desirable future prospect, as it would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the relationship between Ang-2 and outcome. Conclusion The Cytosorb adsorber is not suitable for the extracorporeal removal of the endothelial biomarker Ang-2. Therefore, Ang-2 can still be considered a reliable biomarker for endothelial dysfunction even in the presence of Cytosorb therapy in critically ill patients. Further studies should be conducted to determine whether the removal of Ang-2 could be beneficial when utilizing an appropriate device. Furthermore, the role of Ang-2 in patients with rhabdomyolysis requires further investigation.
