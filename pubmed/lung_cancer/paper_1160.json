Introduction Marine-derived polysaccharides (MPs) are macromolecules isolated and purified from marine or lake organisms. According to different sources, they are categorized into marine animal polysaccharides, marine plant polysaccharides, and marine microbial polysaccharides. Marine animal polysaccharides are mainly derived from invertebrates and fish. Based on different applications, MPs are categorized into gel-forming polysaccharides and bioactive polysaccharides [ 1 2 3 4 As they are among the most abundant substances in the ocean, the anti-obesity [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 1 3 10 Due to their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and desirable properties such as low toxicity and multiple bioactivities, MPs have shown broad application prospects in biological materials [ 1 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 The number of research articles on MP-based hydrogels has been increasing over the past five years. Although the formation and delivery matrices of MP-based hydrogels have been reported in scientific literature, these works mainly focused on the biomedical field (e.g., drug delivery systems, wound dressings, and tissue engineering). Recent reviews have demonstrated that interactions between MPs and other components in the food system will inevitably take place in several ways, and these interactions may have a significant impact on the structure and properties of the foods. However, to date, research on the application of polysaccharide hydrogels in the food industry lags far behind that in the biomedical field. Moreover, the information on the application of MP-based hydrogels in food is scattered. Overall, there still exists a significant dearth of systematic descriptions and summaries concerning the characteristics and food applications of MP-based hydrogels. This article aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap by systematically reviewing and expanding on the latest trends and application boundaries of MPs in food. The novelty of this review lies in the systematic summary of the key characteristics of MP-based hydrogels and their applications in various food sectors, including food packaging, food detection, nutrient encapsulation, and fat substitution, as well as the development of cultured meat and plant-based meat. Moreover, it dives into the structure-activity relationships governing the structure and biological activity of marine polysaccharides, while also examining their safety for food applications through in vivo and in vitro toxicity assessments. Finally, it mentions the potential challenges and prospects of MP-based hydrogels. 2. Review Methodology This review was conducted through a systematic search of scientific databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, focusing specially on peer-reviewed articles published from 2020 to 2025. The keyword combinations used in the search included terms such as “marine + polysaccharides,” “aquatic organisms + polysaccharides,” “algae + polysaccharides,” “algae + polysaccharides,” “chitosan + hydrogel,” “fucoidan + hydrogel,” “polysaccharides + hydrogel + packaging,” “polysaccharides + hydrogel + cultured meat,” and “polysaccharides + structure + biological activity,” among others. The review focused on research articles presenting experimental data related to the hydrogel behavior of MPs, mainly within the context of food processing. Moreover, the bibliographies of retrieved citations were cross-referenced to achieve some additional articles. Exclusion criteria included studies confined to extraction methods and efficiency of MPs, the biological effects of the extracted polysaccharides without mechanistic analysis, or those concentrating on medical applications of hydrogels. The conference proceedings, abstracts, posters, and book chapters due to lack of peer review and review articles based on the recommended criteria were also excluded. 3. Structure of MPs 3.1. Monosaccharides and Backbone The structural characteristics of MPs are first reflected in their monosaccharide composition and polysaccharide backbones. Common monosaccharides in MPs include glucose (Glc), galactose (Gal), mannose (Man), fucose (Fuc), and uronic acid [ 11 21 22 2 23 22 24 25 Figure 1 26 3.2. Molecular Weight Polysaccharides of the same type but with different MWs exhibit different biological activities. For example, HA of 6–20 kDa mainly exhibits immunomodulatory, angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic activities, while HA of 20–200 kDa can participate in wound healing. Higher MW HA (>500 kDa) has anti-angiogenic activity [ 27 28 29 29 30 However, it is not the case that the lower the MW, the greater the biological activity. For fucoidan, longer sugar chains have more complex spatial conformations and more functional groups, which help it bind to multiple coagulation factors simultaneously [ 31 3.3. Sulfation Mode High sulfation is one of the important characteristics of MPs’ structure [ 1 32 29 33 Sulfated polysaccharides exhibit significant biological activity for a variety of reasons, including the following: (1) Sulfation can negatively charge polysaccharides, thereby increasing their water solubility in the appropriate MW range and thus their activity [ 28 34 10 28 28 4. Biological Activities of MPs 4.1. Immunomodulatory Activity The purpose of the immune system is to monitor, recognize, and eliminate pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms. It can conduct immune responses through the phagocytosis of macrophages, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of the complement system, and proliferation of immune cells. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MPs are illustrated in Figure 2 Khongthong et al. [ 35 36 Ulva pertusa 37 In addition to directly affecting the immune system, MPs can indirectly influence immune regulation by modulating the intestinal flora and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) metabolism. By improving intestinal flora, they promote the production of beneficial bacteria and associated metabolites, inhibit the production of harmful bacteria and related metabolites, and enhance the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa [ 38 39 40 Agathobacter Eubacterium ventriosum Veillonella Akkermansia 41 Although numerous studies have provided foundational evidence for the immunomodulatory activity of MPs, significant gaps remain in in vivo validation and clinical translational relevance. Future research should integrate multiple cellular models, animal experiments, and structural modification strategies to systematically investigate the structure–activity relationships and related signaling pathways. 4.2. Anti-Tumor Activity The mechanisms of tumor suppression by MPs are multifaceted. MPs have an inhibitory effect on various cancer cells such as liver cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma [ 10 11 42 43 Common anti-tumor mechanisms of MPs include inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, disrupting the cell cycle, interrupting uncontrolled cell division, and activating apoptosis pathways. Studies have shown that fucoidan can inhibit angiogenesis-related gene expression, such as VEGFs, flt1, flt4, kdr, and kdrl [ 43 43 44 Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus MPs also induce apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cancer cells. Kelp polysaccharides can decrease the membrane potential of cancer cell mitochondria, increasing the production of mitochondrial Ca 2+ 45 2+ 43 46 + 2+ + 2+ The immunomodulatory mechanism of polysaccharides is also one of the main anti-tumor mechanisms. As previously mentioned, MPs have a wide range of immune-activating functions, contributing to the elimination of cancer cells [ 35 47 4.3. Anti-Obesity Activity Obesity is an unhealthy condition in which energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, resulting in an increase in fat mass and weight gain [ 1 10 MPs are considered potential sources of compounds with anti-obesity bioactivity. For example, studies have shown that MPs can alleviate diet-related obesity by modulating gut microbiota (GM). Firmicutes Bacteroidetes 48 On the other hand, MPs can inhibit fat accumulation by modulating lipid metabolism and downregulating the expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis. Ma et al. [ 48 49 5 Although extensive research has demonstrated the positive effects of MPs in combating obesity, in vitro digestion experiments cannot replicate the complex digestive environment within the body, such as gut microbiota metabolism and mucosal absorption. Future studies should further investigate the rebound of obesity phenotypes and gut microbiota following discontinuation of marine polysaccharide supplementation. 4.4. Anti-Inflammatory Activity Inflammation is a defense mechanism of the body against harmful stimuli. However, persistent or uncontrolled inflammatory responses induce or exacerbate related diseases, such as arthritis, gastroenteritis, and cardiovascular disease [ 50 MPs have been demonstrated to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by modulating the production of inflammatory effectors and mediators involved in the inflammatory process, as shown in Figure 3 8 Sargassum fulvellum 51 36 52 48 53 Furthermore, polysaccharides can regulate the immune response by binding to the surface of leukocytes and inhibiting their migration to inflammatory sites. At the same time, polysaccharides with antioxidant activity can also reduce the oxidative stress associated with inflammation by scavenging free radicals [ 50 54 Figure 3 MPs exert their anti-inflammatory effect by interfering with inflammatory signaling pathways, downregulating the expression of inflammatory factors and inflammatory mediators, promoting the polarization of M1-type macrophages to M2-type macrophages, inhibiting immune cell recruitment, and suppressing the adhesion and infiltration of leukocytes.

The imbalance between the two is the pathophysiological basis of ischemic stroke, deep vein thromboembolism, atherosclerosis, and other cardiovascular diseases. The anticoagulant activities of MPs mainly involve inhibition of coagulation factors, augmentation of antithrombin (AT) and heparin cofactor II (HC-II), and inhibition of platelet aggregation. This is because most MPs are rich in sulfate groups, leading to the sugar chains embodying more negative charges, which in turn potentially enhances electrostatic interactions with cationic proteins such as thrombin [ 1 Heparin has been widely used clinically over the years for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. As shown in Figure 4 56 57 6 Sargassum plagiophyllum 58 6 59 60 In summary, although numerous studies have demonstrated that the anticoagulant activity of MPs is closely associated with sulfate groups, future research may systematically elucidate the structure–activity relationship through chemical modification of molecules, thereby developing functionally oriented polysaccharide derivatives. 4.6. Antioxidant Activity Antioxidant refers to the resistance to the peroxide state induced by internal cellular metabolism or external stimuli. Excessive accumulation of free radicals and ROS induces a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Many studies have demonstrated that MPs have excellent antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. For example, Swaminathan [ 61 62 30 63 Sepia prashadi 9 2+ 2+ 64 65 66 67 Ulva pertusa p In summary, MPs have various biological activities, as shown in Table 1 5. Toxicity of MPs in Food Toxicity evaluation is the premise of drug and food research and development. Although the beneficial effects of MPs in humans have been widely recognized, few studies have been conducted on their safety and potential side effects. In vitro studies are typically designed to determine the effects of MPs on cell viability, proliferation, and morphology. The effects of the MPs on cell survival were investigated using an MTT assay in many studies. Rajan et al. [ 73 74 Ecklonia maxima 74 74 74 In vivo experiments are critical for validating the results of in vitro experiments. However, there is a lack of reports on the acute and chronic toxicity of MPs in vivo, which may limit their development and application. In vivo toxicity evaluation of marine-derived polysaccharides through animal experiments commonly employs intraperitoneal injection, oral administration, and aqueous exposure as typical routes of administration. Serum biochemical analysis revealed that oral administration of fucoidan at 200 mg/kg body weight (BW) to rats effectively inhibited obesity without inducing renal or hepatic toxicity [ 75 76 Undaria pinnatifida Padina tetrastromatica Sargassum cinereum 77 78 79 80 78 The final dietary fate of MPs and their degradation products in the body is unknown. The detection of marine-derived polysaccharides in vivo is a significant challenge. Most marine sulfated polysaccharides contain no UV/fluorescence chromophores, and most are not ionized in mass spectrometry. Wang et al. [ 80 80 81 In conclusion, based on existing literature, it can be concluded that there is a lack of acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, carcinogenesis, and teratogenesis studies on MPs, with only a few studies involving toxicity studies. In particular, the specific immune responses, gastrointestinal effects, and other potential adverse effects of oral administration of MPs remain unclear. Moreover, the toxicity of MPs varies widely in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive and systematic toxicological studies on MPs to elucidate their bioavailability, side effects, and mechanisms in vivo. 6. Representative Marine Polysaccharide-Based Hydrogels MPs are common materials for hydrogels. There are numerous application examples in stimuli-responsive, self-healing, injectable, and functional hydrogels. As shown in Table 2 6.1. Chitosan-Based Hydrogel CS, as a rare natural cationic polysaccharide, has become a staple raw material for intelligent hydrogels, including injectable, self-healing, and stimulus-responsive types. Owing to the presence of a substantial amount of amino and hydroxyl groups, CS can form a variety of multifunctional hydrogels in combination with other polymers [ 82 83 82 83 84 85 86 87 83 Despite this, the poor mechanical strength of pure CS-based hydrogels limits its application [ 7 88 6.2. Hyaluronic Acid-Based Hydrogel HA, as a common material for preparing hydrogel dressings, possesses excellent biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and outstanding gel-forming properties [ 87 13 89 87 Similar to CS, HA can be converted into hydrogels under physiological conditions triggered by various stimuli, including light, temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Fan et al. [ 90 89 91 92 93 6.3. Algal Polysaccharide-Based Hydrogel Carrageenan, SA, and agarose are the most common hydrogel materials in algal polysaccharides. Compared with other polysaccharides, they are cheap and readily available. Due to the unique thermal reversibility and hysteresis, agarose can form a controlled hydrogel with excellent stability, especially thermally responsive hydrogels. It can self-assemble into a non–toxic and semi-solid gel state at around room temperature [ 94 95 Carrageenan is another important red algal polysaccharide. Among the various types, κ-carrageenan and ι-carrageenan are the most widely used in hydrogels due to their excellent viscoelastic and gelatinous properties. They can form hydrogels and a three-dimensional double helix network through the cross-linking of neighboring sulfate groups. These gels can be thermally reversible [ 17 18 93 18 17 SA, algin gum, and laminaria polysaccharide are brown algal polysaccharides commonly used in hydrogels. SA has been widely used as a coating material in the food industry due to its excellent film-forming properties [ 96 97 98 99 100 Compared with other algal polysaccharides, due to the difficulty of processing and the lack of consistent and scalable sources, the development of green algal polysaccharides in hydrogels is relatively rare [ 94 101 6.4. Marine Microorganisms Polysaccharides Hydrogel Marine microorganism polysaccharides usually contain special monosaccharides, such as fucose, GlcA, and mannuronic acid, and exhibit diversity in glycosidic linkages. However, limited by the culturing conditions and extraction rates, marine microbial polysaccharides are seldom used in hydrogels. Normally, they can only be incorporated into hydrogels as active substances. For example, the extracellular polysaccharides of red microalgal Porphyridium 102 103 104 Although marine microbial polysaccharides are unique in biological activity and structure, their development is restricted in many aspects, making it difficult to achieve commercialization. Firstly, marine microorganisms live in special environments, which have strict requirements for culturing conditions. In addition, polysaccharides extracted from different microorganisms vary a lot. The exploration, cultivation, and screening of microorganisms take a long time, and the extraction yield is unstable. The relevant laws, regulations, and supervision policies regarding marine microbial polysaccharides are imperfect, posing significant challenges in practical applications. polymers-17-02553-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Applications of representative marine polysaccharide-based hydrogels.

Applications of Marine Polysaccharide-Based Hydrogels in the Food Industry MP-based hydrogels have garnered considerable attention as a promising biomaterial for various applications in the food industry. By acting as packaging coatings or films, encapsulating bioactive compounds, and constructing three-dimensional scaffolds, they have achieved substantial progress in the fields of fruits, meats, baked products, and functional foods ( Figure 5 7.1. Fruits and Vegetables During the farm-to-table process, the spoilage of fruits and vegetables has led to massive waste [ 124 125 84 105 Currently, CS and SA-based hydrogels have been widely applied in the development of fruit packaging materials. They are mainly used in the form of coatings, cushions, or film materials. Xie et al. [ 85 126 112 Although traditional active packaging can release bioactive substances slowly, the speed and dosage are uncontrollable. Smart packaging, an innovative and multifunctional packaging approach, can control the release of active substances and perform rapid non-destructive detection to monitor food quality in real time throughout the storage, transportation, and sales chain [ 127 108 However, hydrogel films prepared from natural polymers are limited by their poor mechanical properties, water resistance, and ultraviolet barrier properties. Besides chemically crosslinking or modifying the hydrogel materials, researchers also prepare hydrogel beads to achieve the release of active substances. Tian et al. [ 112 2+ 128 In the field of fruit and vegetable processing, hydrogels also contribute to the improvement of product quality. The keratin-CS-based hydrogel removed mycotoxins in the fruit juice by embedding Lactobacillus rhamnosus 86 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 15 7.2. Meat and Seafood Similar to the preservation of fruits and vegetables, MP-based hydrogels can also have great potential in the preservation of meat and seafood. For example, chitosan can serve as a coating loaded with zinc oxide and thyme oil for meat preservation [ 129 16 19 During the preservation, some MP-based hydrogels can not only play a role in preservation but also monitor food freshness. Luo et al. [ 19 109 130 110 In recent years, traditional livestock farming has been under pressure from resource and environmental sustainability [ 131 111 115 121 SA, agar, and carrageenan have been investigated for cultured meat, due to their biocompatibility, low toxicity, low cost, and mild gelation. Moreover, the tunable mechanical and physical properties can be well-tailored to cellular requirements. For example, SA-based hydrogel can support the proliferation and differentiation of porcine muscle stem cells [ 132 115 132 133 2+ 134 121 Although hydrogels exhibit great potential for cultured meat production, polysaccharide-based hydrogels still face numerous challenges. Poor mechanical properties are the core bottleneck. Inherent low stiffness and high brittleness make it difficult to match the physiological mechanical environment of different meat tissues. Meanwhile, low cell adhesion efficiency limits cell engraftment. Existing solutions include chemical modification or complexation with biomolecules to provide additional attachment sites [ 115 135 Plant-based meat is another emerging research area for hydrogels. Traditional plant-based meat, composed of single tissue proteins, lacks the hierarchical structures inherent in genuine meat products. Moreover, it suffers from a notable deficiency in flavor [ 136 118 136 137 Overall, MP-based hydrogels have attracted extensive attention in the meat product field due to their excellent properties. However, there are still some deficiencies that need to be improved, especially in terms of long-term stability, specificity, structural design, and interactions with nutritional components, which require further research and verification. 7.3. Baked Products With the progress of the modern food industry, solid fats such as butter and hydrogenated vegetable oils have been extensively utilized in baked foods [ 123 138 123 138 123 Moreover, studies have shown that the embedding effect of hydrogels can also be used to improve the sensory, nutritional, and anti-bacterial properties of baked products. Yeasts encapsulated in SA hydrogels can improve the sensory characteristics of frozen dough bread [ 20 139 140 7.4. Functional Food One primary principle in the design of functional food matrices involves the encapsulation, protection, and controlled release of nutrients. Most bioactive substances, such as polyphenols, fatty acids, ferulic acid, and probiotics, are sensitive to environmental stimuli, including oxygen, temperature, pH, and excessive metal ions, which limits their effectiveness [ 120 141 142 Alginate and CS-based hydrogels are gaining increasing popularity as encapsulating agents due to their excellent encapsulation efficiency, biocompatibility, low cost, and environmental friendliness. Researchers have successfully encapsulated strawberry polyphenols, using pectin and CS-based hydrogels [ 83 143 3 + In addition to compounds, hydrogels can also be used to encapsulate microorganisms. Lasta et al. [ 141 Lactobacillus acidophilus 144 145 120 7.5. Biocatalyst The process of biocatalysis has been immensely used in various sectors of the food industry because of their high substrate specificity, high chemo-selectivity, and green chemistry. However, limited by reusability, stability, and loss of activity, it is expensive to use enzymes in biocatalysis [ 146 147 148 149 MP-based hydrogels such as chitosan, carrageenan, alginate, hyaluronic acid, etc. have been used as supports for enzyme immobilization. For instance, SA and gelatin as a wall material and glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent were used to form hydrogels for the encapsulation of lipase enzyme [ 150 151 147 152 3 − 153 3+ 3 − 3 − 154 MP-based hydrogels have been applied to the immobilization of several enzymes, such as protease [ 155 150 156 157 8. Conclusions and Future Prospects As one of the major resources of marine organisms, MPs have been intensively studied for years. Unique structure, biological activity, and biodegradability make them ideal materials for hydrogels. The abundance of modifiable functional groups in their molecular structures offers great potential for precisely regulating hydrogel properties. These properties give them high hydrophilicity, controllable swelling characteristics, and the ability to encapsulate and release active substances, demonstrating broad application prospects in the food industry. Functional hydrogels and stimuli-responsive hydrogels have wide applications in food packaging and detection. The controllable swelling behavior and controlled digestibility can ensure the effective delivery and sustained release of nutrients and probiotics. In addition, owing to their excellent hydrophilicity, water-holding capacity, and biocompatibility, MP-based hydrogels also have promising application prospects in emerging fields such as cultured meat and plant-based meat, thereby contributing to technological innovation and product optimization in these fields. However, despite the significant potential of MP-based hydrogels as novel green encapsulation systems in the food industry, several challenges need to be resolved before MP-based hydrogels are truly introduced into production. One of the primary limitations lies in the alteration of mechanical integrity. Structural modification of marine polysaccharides is a common approach to enhance their performance. Such structural changes inevitably lead to alterations in biological activity. Despite the fact that most studies have clearly demonstrated that parameters such as sulfation degree and molecular weight affect biological activity, few papers have explored the impact of modifying specific structural units (e.g., glycosidic bond type, branching degree) on the quantitative regulation mechanisms of hydrogels. This limitation also constrains function-oriented design. Future research directions should focus on developing sophisticated controlled-release mechanisms, improving encapsulation efficiency, and improving mechanical strength. In addition, the industrial application of MP-based hydrogels also faces key bottlenecks associated with material safety and mechanism analysis, including the following: (1) Increase in toxicological studies: Most of the documented bioactivities of MPs are still in the research stage. However, the destruction of marine ecosystems leading to marine organisms (especially algae) can enrich pollutants, such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Consequently, the absence of clinical trials, especially toxicological studies including acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, and teratogenicity testing, constitutes a key constraint on the practical application of marine polysaccharides. (2) Drawbacks of natural polymer hydrogels: Poor mechanical properties, insufficient long-term stability, and weak anti-interference ability of natural polymer hydrogels are key factors limiting their applications. Therefore, the development of safe and efficient cross-linking technologies is urgently required to improve their performance. (3) Modern computational methods: Based on extensive structural and activity data of marine polysaccharides, artificial intelligence (AI), bioinformatics, and chemoinformatics can contribute to predicting the structure and function of MPs, analyzing the interactions between polysaccharides and proteins/lipids, simulating the interactions between MPs and biological targets, and further screening target polysaccharides. (4) Multi-omics: Multi-omics integration (e.g., proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics) can better elucidate the metabolic pathways and interactions between hydrogels and bioactive components in vivo, which will facilitate delving into the underlying molecular mechanisms.
