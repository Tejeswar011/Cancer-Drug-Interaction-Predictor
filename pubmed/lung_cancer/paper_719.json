Objective We aimed to develop alternative dosing strategies to optimize durvalumab administration, reduce unnecessary drug use, and ensure sustainable cancer care without sacrificing efficacy. Methods Using the population pharmacokinetic model developed by the licensing holder, we designed two alternative dosing strategies for non-small cell lung cancer based on therapeutic drug monitoring. Adjustments were made to the dose or administration interval, following regulatory standards for in silico dose optimization. A pharmacoeconomic evaluation was conducted to estimate potential cost savings from a medical perspective. Results Both alternative strategies achieved high exposure levels, with 98.1–99.0% of patients exceeding a predefined efficacy target, surpassing the 95.4% predicted by the license holder for the approved 10 mg/kg 2-weekly regimen. They also reduced overall drug exposure by 7–24% and eliminated drug wastage, resulting in an average annual cost reduction of €25,163 (22.9%) per patient. Conclusion Therapeutic drug monitoring-guided adjustments for durvalumab offer a potentially cost-saving way to optimize drug use, reduce healthcare burdens, and lessen environmental impact while ensuring adequate patient exposure. Our proposal's evidence provides a solid basis for a non-inferiority study.

This study evaluated two therapeutic drug monitoring-based approaches using the sponsor’s pharmacokinetic model, improving target exposure (98.1–99.0%) compared with the standard regimen (95.4%). TDM-guided dosing of durvalumab showed significant resource savings, with up to 25.6% less durvalumab required and cost savings of up to €29,242 per patient compared with the standard regimens. Introduction The rising number of cancer patients has strained hospital capacities and increased the workload for clinicians and healthcare providers [ 1 2 3 4 Current licensed dosing strategies of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 1500 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) result in over 95% of patients achieving trough concentrations above the reported efficacy threshold of 53.3 µg/mL, with 75% reaching nearly double that threshold [ 5 6 7 8 Given the financial burden, pressure on healthcare capacity, and environmental impact associated with current durvalumab treatment, there is a critical need for innovative dosing strategies. Since the license holder has postulated an efficacy threshold plasma concentration [ 5 Materials and Methods General Approach We investigated the impact of pharmacokinetically guided dose optimization of durvalumab, assuming that a plasma concentration of 53.3 µg/mL is the threshold for efficacy. This concentration, defined by the license holder, represents a hundred-fold of the Michaelis–Menten ( K m C trough 5 We evaluated four strategies in a representative population (Table S1 Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Simulation All population pharmacokinetic simulations were performed using the software package NONMEM ® 9 For the TDM-based dose and interval strategies, the starting dose was 1500 mg on the first day, followed by dose or interval adjustments based on the C trough 1 C trough C trough C trough 1 S1 Table 1 Dosing strategies over time A.

For the 10-mg/kg dosing strategy, the per-cycle dose was calculated as ten times the patient's weight, with the used amount of drug rounded up to the nearest amount that could be prepared from whole vials. The difference between these rounded and calculated doses was considered wastage. The C trough C trough 10 Pharmacoeconomic Evaluation The pharmacoeconomic analysis was conducted from a Dutch medical perspective, focusing solely on direct costs associated with durvalumab treatment. Cost components included the expenses for the drug itself, which were calculated based on reimbursement rates set by Dutch insurers at €5.075 per milligram, with consideration for potential drug wastage [ 11 12 12 14 15 22 20 22 23 24 S2 To assess the potential cost savings of TDM-based strategies compared with the standard dosing regimens, the mean cost differences and percentage reductions for overall per-patient costs and each cost component, including drug acquisition, administration, monitoring, and TDM testing, were calculated. Results Population Pharmacokinetic Simulations Overall, TDM-based strategies led to a predicted 36–44% reduction in durvalumab trough levels and a predicted 7–24% reduction in total drug exposure, as expressed in the geometric mean of the average concentration in steady-state conditions ( C avg,ss 2 1 Table 2 Pharmacokinetic parameters per dosing strategy at the maximum treatment duration Strategy Geometric mean C avg,ss Geometric mean C trough,ss Average per patient per cycle dose (mg) Weight-based 217 [35] 170 [49] 1275 a Fixed-dose 263 [32] 161 [57] 1500 a TDM-based dose 202 [22] 103 [42] 1167 a TDM-based interval 199 [21] 96 [42] 1115 a Ratios TDM-based dose Weight-based 0.93 0.61 0.92 Fixed-dose 0.77 0.64 0.78 TDM-based interval Weight-based 0.92 0.56 0.87 Fixed-dose 0.76 0.60 0.74 C avg,ss C trough,ss a Fig. 1 Levels of durvalumab per dosing strategy. ( A B A A B TDM The predicted percentage of patients attaining the pharmacokinetic efficacy target C trough TDM, following the first dose, was predicted to lead to treatment adjustments in most patients, with the pattern of adjustments being consistent across both TDM-based strategies. Specifically, 42.3% of patients had either a dose reduction or interval extension, 5.6% had an increase in dose, and 52.1% maintained their original 1500-mg Q4W dose. Following both TDM interventions, 81.1–82.2% of patients received a lower per-cycle dose (normalized to a 4-weekly dosing interval), and only 10.7–11.6% of patients had no change in their dosing strategy since the therapy started (Fig. S2 At the 8-month treatment duration, the TDM-based dose strategy maintained a consistent median dose of 1500 mg (IQR: 1000–1500), while the TDM-based interval strategy sustained a median interval of 4 weeks (IQR: 4–6 weeks). Over the 12-month treatment period, the TDM-based median dose regimen was reduced to 1000 mg (IQR: 740–1000), whereas the TDM-based interval strategy continued with a median 1500-mg dose (IQR: 1000–1500) and an unchanged median 4-week interval (IQR: 4–6 weeks). The treatment characteristics of the approved dosing strategies remained unchanged over time. The weight-based strategy administered a median dose of 640 mg (IQR: 570.4–705) with a median wastage of 53 mg (IQR: 20.6–87.6) at a 2-week interval, while the fixed-dose strategy maintained a 1500-mg dose every 4 weeks. Pharmacoeconomic Evaluation The predicted overall per-patient expenses associated with TDM-based strategies for dose and interval adjustments were comparable, with mean costs per patient of €62,025 and €62,899 for 8 months and €85,030 and €83,740 for 12 months, respectively. In contrast, the expenses for currently licensed dosing strategies of 10 mg/kg Q2W and 1500 mg Q4W were higher, with mean costs of €78,048 and €73,293 for 8 months and €112,982 and €106,114 for 12 months, respectively (Fig. 2 S3 .

TDM We predicted that the TDM-based dosing and interval strategies result in substantial cost reductions compared with the licensed regimens (Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Cost differences per treatment component per patient between TDM-based dosing strategies and licensed dosing regimens. Comparison of costs between TDM-based strategies and the 10-mg/kg every 2 weeks regimen at ( A B C D TDM Discussion We demonstrate the potential of TDM-based strategies to potentially improve the cost effectiveness of treatment with durvalumab. The TDM-based strategies resulted in 7–24% lower C avg,ss C trough,ss Some authors of this publication previously developed a dose-banding strategy to optimize durvalumab dosing using the same base pharmacokinetic model by Baverel et al. [ 9 25 C trough,ss 25 C trough,ss C avg,ss 25 C avg,ss Both dose-banding and TDM-based strategies are predicted to effectively reduce drug exposure and, thereby, help dispel the common misconception among patients that \"more is always better\" in immunotherapy. While dose-banding is more straightforward to implement in clinical practice—following predefined dosing categories without requiring TDM, thereby reducing additional costs and labor—it does not account for interindividual variability caused by other factors than body weight, which may reduce therapeutic efficacy due to undertreatment, or increased durvalumab use and costs due to overtreatment. In contrast, TDM-based strategies provide a more precise, patient-specific approach by continuously adjusting dosing based on individual pharmacokinetics. This approach leads to improved drug utilization and more significant exposure reduction without compromising effective exposure. Because the C avg,ss C trough,ss 26 27 29 However, implementing TDM introduces additional costs and requires specific expertise in, for example, pharmacokinetic modeling. Besides the availability of a bioanalytical assay, the use of clinically friendly software to tailor the individual dose based on measured drug levels and pharmacokinetic data is a prerequisite for successful clinical implementation. The high cost efficiency of TDM could offset these expenses, including assay development and integration expenses such as personnel training. Therefore, a centralized approach may be a viable solution for institutions that prefer to avoid the challenges of testing with partially filled assay plates or face other barriers, such as insufficient availability of qualified personnel or difficulties in implementing and conducting assays. In a centralized model, hospitals collaborate by sending patient samples to a designated testing facility, where the assays are conducted, the results are interpreted, and individualized treatment recommendations are formulated. The recommendations are then communicated by the centralized pharmacist to the treating physician. This approach alleviates the burden of assay implementation and personnel training, ensuring that hospitals lacking the necessary resources can still benefit from TDM. Our pharmacoeconomic analysis acknowledged inherent uncertainties stemming from variations in healthcare systems, reimbursement policies, and regional practices. For example, the cost of TDM testing can vary. Our analysis used a cost estimate of €57.50 per TDM test, whereas the nationwide reimbursement set by the Dutch Healthcare Authority (Nederlandse Zorgautoriteit, NZa) is €115. However, variations in costs and reimbursements are likely to have a minimal impact on overall savings, as using NZa’s reimbursement rate would reduce total savings by only 0.1–0.2%. Furthermore, the cost of durvalumab itself presents a complex variable. Although we estimated potential mean cost decreases of durvalumab per patient ranging from €9785 (14.3%) to €21,433 (21.7%) based on treatment duration and TDM approach, the actual price is often confidential. This lack of transparency underscores the limitations of relying solely on reimbursed prices for cost projections. Nevertheless, since the reduction in drug use remains consistent across strategies, the proportional cost savings will persist regardless of the actual vial price. In addition, the potential cost savings from TDM-based strategies are subject to significant variability across healthcare systems and regions. Factors such as local median and maximum treatment durations, healthcare practices, resource availability, and economic conditions contribute to this variability. Conclusion TDM-based dosing offers a key advantage over weight-based, fixed, and dose-banding strategies by tailoring treatment to individual pharmacokinetics, thereby improving drug utilization, minimizing unnecessary exposure, and reducing the risks of undertreatment or overtreatment. As our approach allows for dose adjustments based on durvalumab concentrations in both steady-state and non–steady-state conditions, it enables individualized dosing throughout the entire treatment course—from initiation to maintenance. Although this study was based on modeling and simulation, the results lay a solid foundation for studying the non-inferiority of our proposed dosing strategy, potentially in combination with additional cost-saving practices such as vial sharing, in lung cancer patients.
