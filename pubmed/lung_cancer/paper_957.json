Multifaceted Applications of Synthesized Silver Nanoparticles From Marine Fungus Aspergillus flavus BioMed Research International 2025 7161915 2025 10.1155/bmri/7161915  Academic Editor: 1. Introduction The term “marine fungi” encompasses a diverse range of fungi that typically inhabit natural environments in marine and estuarine settings [ 1 2 Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Chytridiomycota are the three basic phyla that are considered to be included in the realm of marine fungi currently being studied by science. These fungi can be found in a wide range of marine ecosystems, spanning the open ocean to sediments, mangroves, and coral reefs. Numerous marine fungi have developed special adaptations that allow them to flourish in environments that are submerged in water. The osmoregulatory systems that these fungi have developed allow them to maintain the stability of their internal salt concentrations despite the fact that the surrounding conditions are constantly changing. In addition to this, they are capable of producing secondary metabolites, such as polyketides and terpenoids, which possess antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal effects [ 3 There is no doubt that nanotechnology stands out as one of the technologies that is extremely promising and is progressing at a rapid pace. In recent decades, nanoparticles have garnered significant interest due to their distinct properties in areas such as optics, chemistry, magnetism, biology, and electricity. These properties differ from those observed in their corresponding bulk materials [ 4 5 6 7 Ag‐NPs have diverse applications in medicine, serving as enhancers for vaccines, drugs for diabetes, agents for wound and bone healing, components in biosensors, and contributors to anticancer treatment. The unique features of Ag‐NPs emphasize their importance in medical applications, highlighting the prospective role they play in advancing healthcare and medical interventions [ 8 + 0 + 0 8 10 Several marine fungi, including Aspergillus Penicillium Fusarium Trichoderma 9 11 Our aim in this research is to synthesize Ag‐NPs utilizing cell‐free filtrate (CFF) derived from the marine fungus Aspergillus flavus 2.

Sampling and Fungal Isolation Aseptic procedures were used to collect sediment samples from various locations, including the Suez Gulf, the city of Hurghada, the National Institute and the Beach of Oceanography. The specific coordinates for these locations are 27° 17 ′ ″ ′ ″ 13 −1 −5 ° 14 2.4. Preparation of Cell‐Free Extract To create the inoculum for the fungal broth, a loop carrying approximately 1 × 10 6 ° 15 2.5. Green Synthesis of Ag‐NPs The supernatants, also known as biomass filtrate, were engaged in the synthesis of environmentally friendly Ag‐NPs. In 100‐mL Erlenmeyer flasks, 30 mL of 10 mmole AgNO 3 ° + 16 2.6. Characterizations of Ag‐NPs We used a METASHUV‐9000A UV‐visible double‐beam spectrophotometer to analyze the absorption spectra of the generated (Ag‐NPs) over the wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm. To assess the morphology and dimensions of the synthesized Ag‐NPs, TEM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed. The SEM analysis was performed to determine the size, shape, and morphology of the manufactured nanoparticles. A specimen was prepared by placing a drop of the solution onto a copper grid coated with carbon. Following this, any surplus solution was discarded, and the sample was left to cure naturally. The SEM research was observed at the Regional Center for Mycology and Biotechnology at Al‐Azhar University, Egypt, using a JEOL JSM‐5500LV Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL Instruments Inc., Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV [ 17 α θ 10 2.7. Genotypic Characterization of a Potent Isolate The genomic DNA extraction from isolate (MK4) used the cellular DNeasy Kit, following the standard instructions. For the fungi, genomic DNA extraction was performed from cultures with 7 days of age using the DNeasy technologies provided by QIAGEN. Amplification of ribosomal spacer DNA (ITS) was carried out using primers ITS1 and ITS4. Subsequently, the purification of the PCR products was accomplished using the QIAquick Kit [ 18 2.8. Antimicrobial Activity of Ag‐NPs The well diffusion method was used to assess the antibacterial activity of the synthesized Ag‐NPs [ 19 μ μ μ μ 3 10 n 2.9. Antifungal Test Activity of Ag‐NPs The fungus inhibition efficacy of Ag‐NP was assessed by diffusion assay against the aforementioned fungal strains that were enumerated by YPD medium and allowed to incubate for a duration of 3–5 days at 30°C [ 20 6 μ 3 21 2.10. Determination of Antioxidant Activity The radical scavenging activity of Ag‐NP and vitamin C was assessed using the DPPH assay.

Wound‐Healing Assay The cell scratch assay was used to evaluate the wound‐healing potential of Ag‐NPs compared to the normal 3T3 fibroblast cell line. The experiment involved seeding 2 × 10 5 2 μ 23 2.13. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 for Windows, Version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). The experimental results were presented as means with standard errors (±SD). Following the one‐way ANOVA analysis, the significance set at p 3. Results 3.1. Fungal Isolation and Screening for Ag‐NP Synthesis The primary focus of the current study was the extracellular synthesis of Ag‐NPs using the supernatant of marine fungi. Of the 23 fungal isolates obtained from the sediment sample, their potential to generate Ag‐NPs was systematically evaluated. The screening process pinpointed a singular isolate, named MK4, which exhibited the ability to synthesize Ag‐NP. Interestingly, the reduction of Ag + 3 1 Figure 1 UV‐visible absorption spectrum of silver nanoparticles synthesized by the marine fungal isolate MK4. The surface plasmon resonance peak observed at 460 nm confirms the successful extracellular biosynthesis of Ag‐NPs. 3.2.

Sequencing the Most Effective Fungal Isolate (MK4) During the detection phase, the most effective marine fungal isolate (MK4), which is capable of producing Ag‐NPs, was chosen. Phenotypic and molecular phylogenetic studies were used in the classification process. The fungal isolate MK4 was used to extract genomic DNA, which was then partially amplified from the 18S rRNA gene. The resulting amplicons were visualized through agarose gel electrophoresis. There was a perfect match between the 18S rRNA gene sequence and A. flavus A. flavus OQ651270 5 Figure 5 Phylogenetic tree of fungal isolate MK4 based on partial 18S rDNA sequence analysis, confirming its identification as Aspergillus flavus 3.7.

Specifically, Ag‐NPs exhibited an antioxidant activity of 47.5%, surpassing the 29.4% antioxidant activity observed with vitamin C. These findings highlight the significantly superior antioxidant activity of Ag‐NPs compared to vitamin C. 3.10.

Discussion Nanotechnology has recently become an interdisciplinary area, incorporating ideas and research from many other scientific and medical fields, such as mathematics, engineering, biology, materials science, physics, and chemistry [ 24 25 This study delves deeper into the realm of nanoparticle synthesis by focusing on the biological approach utilizing marine fungi specifically isolated from the Red Sea in Egypt. This method has significant advantages, eliminating the need for potentially harmful chemicals, extreme temperatures, or high pressures. This inherent simplicity leads to a straightforward and scalable process, paving the way for potential large‐scale production [ 26 27 + ° 3 28 3 3 1 3 29 Fungi have an advantage over other microorganisms due to their prolific production of proteins and enzymes. This attribute enables fungi to synthesize nanoparticles quickly and sustainably, making them a favorable choice for nanoparticle production [ 30 + 0 + 1 31 A. terreus 3 28 Using FTIR spectroscopy to examine protein–Ag‐NP interactions demonstrated that biomolecules were pivotal in lowering Ag + −1 −1 2 −1 −1 32 33 −1 34 −1 4 −1 We used XRD and TEM to analyze the Ag‐NPs produced in depth, hoping to uncover new applications for them. In this study, the crystalline characteristics of Ag‐NPs were examined using XRD. Four diffraction peaks were seen at 2 θ D k λ β θ 3 A. terreus To gain deeper insight into the structure and morphology of the Ag‐NPs, TEM analysis was conducted. Figure 4 35 Pycnoporus sanguineus A. terreus 36 Penicillium expansum A. terreus 37 A. terreus 38 39 A. terreus 4 40 6 35 The comprehensive molecular investigations, coupled with the classical taxonomy outcomes, robustly affirmed the categorization of the isolated strain as A. flavus OQ651270 5 Aspergillus Aspergillus 41 46 In general, Ag‐NPs exhibited effective inhibition against a range of bacterial species, although with varying degrees of efficacy. Contrary to the antibacterial impact being contingent on the gram classification (positive or negative), our research findings indicate that the effectiveness of Ag‐NPs is more closely tied to the specific bacterial species. This variability is likely attributed to the distinct membranes and cell walls inherent in different bacterial species. During the screening against various bacteria, the most potent effects were observed against S. aureus Proteus mirabilis B. subtilis S. typhimurium A. hydrophila 32 35 47 48 The exceptional antibacterial efficacy of Ag‐NPs can be attributed in large part to their unique physicochemical characteristics, such as their dimensions, morphology, and surface properties. Due to their ability to interact extensively with microbial surfaces and potentially infiltrate cells, they exhibit effectiveness in altering bacterial structures and functions. The significant ratio of surface area to volume is a crucial determinant that distinguishes Ag‐NPs from other salts in relation to their antibacterial characteristics [ 49 + 50 51 Bacillus Escherichia coli P. aeruginosa S. aureus 52 μ −1 A. flavus S. aureus B. subtilis P. aeruginosa E. coli C. albicans Candida glabrata Candida tropicalis Candida parapsilosis 53 Penicillium italicum S. aureus E. coli C. albicans C. tropicalis 53 + 54 55 + 56 57 P. aeruginosa Staphylococcus epidermidis 58 59 The results of the effective dispersion technique showed that Ag‐NP inhibited the growth of the tested strains of fungi, including A. fumigatus A. niger A. flavus A. terreus A. parasiticus P. oxalicum F. solani F. oxysporum C. albicans 2 A. niger μ 60 61 54 Rothia endophytica C. albicans 62 63 Colletotrichum falcatum μ A. flavus Aspergillus ochraceus Penicillium chrysogenum Fusarium chlamydosporum 64 μ Syzygium cumini A. flavus A. parasiticus 65 The fungal cell wall comprises a rigid and resilient matrix accounting for approximately 40% of the cell’s volume, supported by an array of structural proteins and polysaccharides. Its outer surface is enriched with mannosylated glycoproteins containing modified N‐ and O‐linked oligosaccharides [ 66 β 67 68 + 69 The antioxidant properties of Ag‐NPs are attributed to the adsorption of fungal components from a CFF onto the nanoparticles [ 70 Cladosporium cladosporioides 19 71 Biogenic Ag‐NPs demonstrate impacts on tumor cells that extend beyond their widely recognized antibacterial properties [ 29 6 A. flavus F. oxysporum E. coli S. aureus 50 μ 3 72 50 41 43 73 76 The primary objective of antitumor therapy is to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their elimination, ideally without harming adjacent healthy tissues. Traditional treatment strategies utilize agents that interfere with cell cycle regulation and exert cytotoxic effects; however, these often result in severe adverse reactions and are frequently ineffective against resistant tumor types [ 77 78 79 80 81 In recent decades, Ag‐NPs have been widely investigated for their role in wound healing.
