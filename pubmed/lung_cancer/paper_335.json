However, the mechanisms underlying loss of tolerance to gut bacteria in genetically at-risk individuals are unclear.

The intestinal immune system develops differently in GF and conventional SPF mice, as exemplified by the skewed M1 phenotype of GF splenic macrophages that we observed. Furthermore, our experimental model was limited to gavage of adult GF mice rather than maternal microbial transmission. In addition, we were technically limited to visualizing bacteria using a universal FISH probe in a small number of synovial biopsies, and the human tissue fixative precluded staining with additional immunofluorescent antibodies. Nonetheless, GF and gnotobiotic SKG mice clarify the mechanistic role played by intestinal bacteria in SpA. In conclusion, after curdlan, proinflammatory M1 macrophages containing DNA from gut bacteria drive Th17 differentiation and IL-23–dependent ileitis and arthritis in susceptible ZAP70 W163C Methods Supplemental Methods Supplemental Table 1 Sex as a biological variable. Our study exclusively examined female mice because the disease phenotype is dominant in females. For studies in patients, both men and women were included. Study approval. Approval for all animal experiments was obtained from the University of Queensland animal ethics committee.
