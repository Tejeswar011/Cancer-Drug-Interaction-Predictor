Introduction In recent years, the demand for vegetable oils has surged dramatically alongside the advancement of modern industrialization [ 1 2 3 4 5 Currently, the application value of vegetable oils is typically assessed by measuring indicators such as kernel morphological traits, fatty acid composition, phytosterols, and tocopherols [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Phytosterols and tocopherols are important secondary metabolites and nutritional quality indicators, significantly contributing to an oil’s antioxidant capacity [ 8 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Currently, an increasing number of novel woody oil plants are gaining attention, such as yellowhorn ( Xanthoceras sorbifolia 35 Hippophae rhamnoides 36 Acer truncatum Bunge 5 Chionanthus retusus Chionanthus 37 C. retusus 38 39 C. retusus C. retusus C. retusus C. retusus C. retusus 2.

Tocopherol Determination The content and composition of tocopherols were determined using liquid chromatography according to the Chinese National Standard [ 43 C. retusus 2.7. Statistical Analyses Data on fruit characteristics, kernel characteristics, yield, kernel percentage (Kp), oil content, sterols, and tocopherol, as well as fatty acid and sterol composition, were analyzed using IBM SPSS 19.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical analyses included analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test for multiple comparisons, correlation analysis, and cluster analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Cluster heatmaps were constructed using TBtools-II V2.225 software. The data presented in the above experimental analysis were obtained from three independent replicates and are reported as the mean ± standard deviation. 3. Results 3.1. Fruit Morphological Diversity in Chionanthus retusus Morphological characteristics serve as important phenotypic indicators for evaluating phenotypic diversity in germplasm and screening superior clones for oil production [ 44 45 C. retusus Table 2 p 3.2. Oil Content and Fatty Acid Composition of C. retusus Kernels Oil content is a key indicator for evaluating the potential of kernels as an oilseed crop, with higher content reducing extraction costs. Analysis of oil content in kernels from 30 C. retusus Table 3 45 Fatty acid composition is a critical parameter for assessing oil quality. Seven major fatty acids were detected in the kernel oil of the 30 germplasms ( Table 2 Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), known for their health benefits, are key quality markers for vegetable oils. Based on double-bond count, fatty acids were categorized as saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), or polyunsaturated (PUFA). The mean SFA content was 2.41% (range: 1.00–3.64%, CV = 12.02%), MUFA was 54.51% (49.87–60.00%, CV = 6.17%), and PUFA was 33.23% (25.01–42.74%, CV = 10.22%) ( Table 3 C. retusus 3.3.

Comprehensive Assessment of Fruit Quality in 30 C. retusus Germplasm Accessions Based on the eigenvalues and loading matrix of the five principal components, the principal component scores were calculated ( Table 7 F = (0.32810F 1 2 3 4 5 (1) The F scores for the fruit quality traits of different germplasm accessions were calculated and ranked according to the results. The accessions WS-4, T-8, T-4, WS-33, and T-9, which ranked in the top five based on F scores, exhibited superior fruit quality traits and represent promising candidates for breeding with desirable fruit characteristics. 3.8. Analysis of Secondary Metabolite Composition in Kernels from 30 C. retusus Germplasm Accessions Analysis of numerous fruit morphological indicators was included in the aforementioned assessments to understand fruit quality characteristics across different germplasm accessions. Two-dimensional PCA biplots were constructed based on the composition and content data of fatty acids, phytosterols, and tocopherols in the kernels, as shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 For fatty acid composition and content, the first two PCs cumulatively explained 62.10% of the total variation. The 30 C. retusus Figure 3 C. retusus For phytosterol composition and content, the first two PCs cumulatively explained 65.00% of the total variation. The germplasm accessions were classified into four clusters ( Figure 3 For tocopherol composition and content, the first two PCs cumulatively explained 88.60% of the total variation. The accessions were grouped into three clusters ( Figure 3 The clustered heatmap of the four components ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 2 4. Discussion 4.1.

In oils, phytosterols exist predominantly (>50–97%) as free sterols, with β-sitosterol being the most abundant. In approximately 60–70% of vegetable oils, β-sitosterol comprises 50–80% of total phytosterols [ 46 50 51 C. retusus O. europaea (Xanthoceras sorbifolium Arachis hypogaea 52 53 54 Tocopherols are viscous, pale yellow, oil-soluble compounds [ 55 28 27 56 C. retusus 34 57 58 Helianthus annuus 59 Zea mays 60 C. retusus 29 30 31 C. retusus 4.2.
