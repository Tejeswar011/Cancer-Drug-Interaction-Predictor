Although substantial strides have been made in the domains of early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions within contemporary medicine, a considerable proportion of patients inevitably encounter resistance to treatment, culminating in therapeutic inefficacy and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Typically, such resistance is exhibited by tumor cells acquiring refractoriness to radiotherapy, chemotherapeutic drugs, targeted agents, and immunotherapeutic modalities. Accumulating data in recent years have increasingly implicated interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pivotal mediator of inflammatory responses, in not only the initiation, advancement, metastatic behavior, and immune escape of tumors but also in the promotion of resistance to various oncologic treatments. This review delineates current findings concerning the involvement of IL-6 in tumor-related therapeutic applications, with emphasis on its impact on prognosis, therapeutic resistance, and potential treatment pathways, aiming to facilitate the strategic integration of IL-6 in the refinement of cancer treatment approaches.

Through binding to mIL-6R [ 3 4 5 6 3 Recent investigations have demonstrated that IL-6 exerts a pivotal function in conferring resistance to multiple tumor-directed therapeutic strategies, encompassing radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 The mechanisms of IL-6 in radioresistance, chemotherapy resistance, targeted therapy resistance, and immune resistance IL-6 and radioresistance Radiation therapy exerts its cytotoxic effects on tumor cells primarily by triggering DNA damage and initiating intracellular oxidative stress responses. RT has been shown to induce alterations in multiple signaling mediators within the tumor microenvironment (TME), culminating in elevated IL-6 expression at both the irradiated tissue sites and within the TME itself. Radioresistant esophageal cancer cells have been observed to secrete higher levels of IL-6 compared to their radiosensitive counterparts [ 7 8 8 9 10 10 11 + 12 13 14 15 IL-6 and chemotherapy resistance Chemoresistance is generally mediated through diverse biological mechanisms, encompassing the upregulation of drug efflux transporters, alterations in drug target structures, enhancement of DNA repair pathways, disruption of cell cycle regulatory processes, and evasion of immune surveillance. IL-6-dependent resistance to chemotherapy has been correlated with the elevated expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and XIAP, alongside a reduction in caspase-3 levels and the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling cascades [ 16 Under genotoxic stress, the tumor suppressor gene p53 has been found to transactivate Panx1, triggering the expression of IL-6 [ 17 18 17 19 20 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 29 30 33 34 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 IL-6 and resistance to targeted therapy Targeted therapy has been developed to selectively inhibit pivotal molecular targets within tumor cells while minimizing collateral effects on normal tissue. Although substantial therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in clinical settings, resistance to such treatments is frequently observed over time, ultimately resulting in disease progression. Widely utilized targeted agents include inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), among others. EGFR modulates key processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival via ligand binding—particularly to epidermal growth factor (EGF)—which subsequently initiates intracellular signaling cascades. In neoplastic cells, EGFR is frequently subject to aberrant activation or mutational alteration [ 41 42 43 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 HER2-targeted therapy, such as trastuzumab, constitutes a pivotal treatment modality for managing HER2-positive malignancies, particularly breast cancer. The proliferative and survival capabilities of HER2-positive tumor cells have been shown to be enhanced by IL-6 through the activation of the JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades, thereby diminishing the therapeutic efficacy of HER2 inhibition. Aberrant expression of PDGFRA has been reported to induce trastuzumab resistance by activating STAT3, which in turn promotes IL-6 upregulation [ 50 VEGF inhibitors, such as bevacizumab, have been recognized as a key therapeutic strategy directed against tumor-driven angiogenesis. Nonetheless, tumors with angiogenesis dependency continue to display resistance to these agents. STAT3, as a downstream target of the IL-6 signaling pathway, has been shown to induce the upregulation of angiogenic genes, including VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor [ 51 IL-6 and immune resistance A dualistic function of the immune system in tumorigenesis and progression has been widely acknowledged. Throughout cancer development, the immune system not only participates in the eradication of malignant cells but may also contribute to tumor advancement by enabling immune evasion, primarily through modifications in tumor cell immunogenicity [ 52 Inhibitory immune checkpoints are membrane-bound proteins expressed on T cells that convey suppressive signals upon interaction with corresponding ligands present on other cells, including malignant cells [ 3 3 IL-6 has been identified as a potential contributor to resistance against immune checkpoint blockade. Through activation of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis, the expression of immunogenic frameshift neoantigens is suppressed via the induction of SMG1, which operates under the regulation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, thereby impairing antitumor immune responses [ 53 The interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 has been shown to initiate co-inhibitory signaling cascades, resulting in the functional suppression of CD8 + 54 55 56 57 The functional activities of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, which serve as two principal effector cell types in anti-tumor immune responses, are subject to modulation by IL-6. The differentiation of CD8 + 58 + 59 60 + 60 61 62 63 A lack of responsiveness of NK cells to immune checkpoint therapy has been associated with MDSCs [ 64 52 64 64 65 66 67 Dendritic cells (DCs) serve as antigen-presenting cells that induce antigen-specific immune responses through the activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. IL-6 has been a principal inducer of elevated CD14 + 68 + 69 + 70 56 71 72 The traditional formulation Banxia xiexin decoction has been reported to downregulate the expression of IFNγ and IL-6, inhibit activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling cascade, and modulate the drug responsiveness of GC cells by regulating O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase expression via PD-L1 signaling [ 73 + + 74 IL-6 as a therapeutic target In light of IL-6’s central involvement in tumor progression and resistance to therapy, the targeting of IL-6 signaling has been increasingly recognized as a viable therapeutic approach. As a pivotal modulator of genotoxic stress-induced anticancer immune responses, functional inhibition of IL-6 has been demonstrated to redirect cancer cell elimination from a predominantly apoptotic route to an immunogenic one, thereby initiating and sustaining long-lasting antitumor immunity [ 75 Anti-IL-6R therapeutic intervention prevents the interaction between IL-6 and IL-6Rα, thereby suppressing both classical and trans-signaling pathways mediated by IL-6. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6R, has been shown to inhibit tumor progression in murine models by disrupting IL-6 signaling, leading to decreased vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression, and diminished microvascular density and vessel diameter [ 76 11 77 78 79 80 81 81 Siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6, prevents its binding to IL-6R and has been demonstrated to specifically inhibit IL-6-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat3. This inhibition results in a marked reduction of Stat3-regulated downstream proteins, including MCL-1, Bcl-XL, and survivin, as well as a broad decrease in the expression of IL-6-responsive genes [ 82 82 Upon activation, STAT3 translocates into the nucleus and initiates the transcription of target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc, ultimately promoting unchecked cellular proliferation [ 83 84 85 86 86 Combination immunotherapy In murine models of liver cancer, targeted suppression of IL-6 signaling led to reduced PD-L1 expression within tumor regions, and when administered in combination with anti-T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 therapy, elicited a synergistic enhancement of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapy [ 54 55 58 87 87 88 89 89 IL-6 holds promise as a biomarker to predict the response of patients to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy in the future. NSCLC patients with low baseline concentrations of IL-6 in plasma specimens or tumor tissues may derive greater benefits from ICIs [ 55 90 91 92 In addition to drug resistance, toxicity is also a significant challenge in ICB therapy [ 89 93 94 89 Studies have found that both anti-PD-L1 therapy [ 78 89 89 89 antirheumatic drugs [ 89 89 89 89 90 95 96 97 98 Combination emerging treatments Adoptive immunotherapy using chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)-engineered T cells has been currently used for large B-cell lymphoma [ 99 100 101 102 Advantages IL-6 plays multiple roles in cancer treatment, not only participating in regulating treatment efficacy but also potentially serving as a therapeutic target to help overcome resistance, with broad application prospects. Inhibiting the IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway can disrupt multiple tumor-supporting mechanisms simultaneously. Challenges and limitations The therapeutic targeting of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling axis continues to encounter substantial limitations in oncological applications. Due to its integration within a broader and highly interconnected signaling network, tumors possess the capacity to activate compensatory pathways that circumvent the inhibition of any single signaling cascade [ 83 103 83 Conclusion and prospect In summary, the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway is a key mechanism in tumor biology. Combining IL-6 targeted therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other treatment modalities represents a highly valuable research field. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of IL-6 and its roles in different tumor types still require extensive research to reveal and clarify. In the future, efforts should be focused on researching biomarkers that can predict the therapeutic response to the IL-6/JAK/ STAT3 signaling axis and more specific inhibitors, and integrating them into existing treatments.
