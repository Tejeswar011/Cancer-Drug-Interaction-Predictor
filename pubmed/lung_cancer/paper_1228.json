Exercise may help relieve depressive symptoms and is associated with anti-inflammatory effects. This research methodically assesses how various exercise modalities influence peripheral inflammatory markers in individuals with depression, so that more personalized and precise exercise schemes can be provided for people with depression to improve inflammation. Methods: Randomized controlled trials on depressive disorder, exercise, and inflammation published until May 2025 were screened in five databases. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB2.0) was used to evaluate potential biases, with random effects meta-analyses gauging the impact of varying exercise regimens on peripheral inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α) involving exercise types, intensity, frequency, and length. Meta-regression analyses were employed to show the sources of heterogeneity and investigate potential moderator variables influencing CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α (PROSPERO CRD42024590612). Results: A total of 13 unique studies with 1004 participants were included. Overall, exercise training could alleviate depressive symptoms (SMD = −0.59, 95%CI: [−0.86, −0.32], I 2 p 2 p p exercise modalities depressive disorder inflammation meta-analysis National Natural Science Foundation of China 32000838 Chinese Universities Scientific Fund 2024JNPD002 2024058 This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 32000838); and the Chinese Universities Scientific Fund (grant numbers 2024JNPD002 and 2024058). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Depressive disorder is a severe, persistent mental health condition. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 5% of adults worldwide are affected by depression [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Given the limitations and side effects of pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise therapy are increasingly important [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 35 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 49 51 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 2. Materials and Methods The methodology for this present study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 2020 [ 58 http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024590612 Supplementary File S2 2.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 2.1.1. Inclusion Criteria and Rationale All studies incorporated into this meta-analysis had to satisfy specific PICOS criteria (Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcomes, and Study Design). The inclusion requirements were as follows: (1) Participants of the exercise group had to be adults aged 18 or older, regardless of gender. This included individuals with a formal diagnosis of depressive disorder based on the DSM-5™ Diagnostic Criteria reference guide or ICD classification [ 4 59 59 2.1.2. Exclusion Criteria The meta-analysis excluded studies if they fell into any of the following criteria: (1) Clinical trials that were ongoing or had initiated physical activity programs for expectant or nursing mothers. (2) Trials that incorporated nutritional advice as a comparative intervention. (3) Research studies including individuals with a clinical diagnosis of anxiety or bipolar disorder. (4) Studies that were short on details about the specifics of exercise—such as its frequency, intensity, duration, volume, and progression. (5) Animal studies, conference reports, review papers, editorials, and non-English language articles. (6) The experimental group used acute exercise intervention. (7) The data is incomplete and the data cannot be converted. 2.2. Search Strategy The protocol for this research was developed in advance and officially registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024590612). The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [ 60 Supplementary Table S1 2.3. Quality Assessment To evaluate the methodological rigor of the studies in our analysis, we employed the RoB 2.0 tool [ 61 62 2.4. Data Extraction In each reviewed study, pertinent details were extracted, including the following: (1) Study characteristics (title, author information, publication year). (2) Participants’ characteristics (sex, age and sample size). (3) Clinical features (depression diagnostic criteria baseline depression severity using standard scales, e.g., HAM-D/BDI). (4) Exercise intervention parameters: exercise type (e.g., mixed exercise [ 63 64 65 66 67 68 66 59 2.5. Data Synthesis and Analysis For depressive symptoms, outcomes were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs, whereas mean differences (MDs) were used for the three common inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α). Biomarker units (CRP in mg/L and TNF-α and IL-6 in pg/mL) were harmonized into international standard units, and standard errors were harmonized to SDs. Random effects meta-analyses were fitted using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) for τ 2 2 To assess the robustness of the results and identify potential sources of heterogeneity, leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted. A prespecified influence diagnostics panel was used to identify studies with undue influence: studentized residuals (|z| > 2 flagged as outliers), hat values (high leverage > 2/k), and Cook’s distances (high influence > 4/(k − 1)). Studies flagged by any diagnostic were subjected to influence-robust sensitivity re-analyses under the HKSJ framework. In addition, subgroup analyses were performed to examine the effects of specific exercise prescriptions and participant characteristics on individuals with depression. The selection of these analytical variables was based on the characteristics of the included literature, which suggests that the effects of exercise interventions may be influenced by the exercise parameters themselves (such as exercise type, intensity, frequency, length, etc.) and the baseline characteristics of the subjects (such as severity of depression, age, the proportion of females, presence or absence of comorbidities, etc.). To further explore potential sources of heterogeneity and the influence of continuous moderators (e.g., exercise parameters, participant characteristics), univariable meta-regression analyses were performed using the random effects framework with REML for τ 2 Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger’s regression test, but only when ≥10 studies were available for a given outcome, as recommended by the Cochrane guidelines. All tests were two-tailed (α = 0.05) and implemented in R software (version 4.2.0), using the metafor, dplyr, ggplot2, and knitr packages. 3. Results 3.1. The Process of Study Selection The initial search yielded a total of 2833 potentially eligible reports. After duplicate entries were eliminated, 2228 titles and abstracts were carefully reviewed. In the next stage, 27 studies were chosen for full-text reading, and of these, 14 studies were excluded, leaving 13 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the present review [ 49 50 51 52 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 Figure 1 3.2. Characteristics of Included Studies A summary of the key characteristics of the 13 studies included in our review is presented in Table 1 Table S2 69 76 72 70 74 72 74 49 50 51 69 70 75 73 71 76 77 52 3.3. Description of Exercise Interventions Aerobic exercise emerged as the most extensively researched form of exercise, featuring in 11 RCTs (84.62%). In contrast, anaerobic exercise was the focus of merely two RCTs, representing just 15.38% of the research. The aerobic exercise programs across these studies displayed considerable variation in types, frequency, length, and intensity. Usually, participants engaged in workouts 3 to 5 days each week, with intervention lengths ranging from 4 weeks to 48 weeks. Each session generally spanned between 30 and 60 min. The intensity of aerobic exercise was often determined using different heart rate per minute assessments. Only a single study reported an exercise progression plan, where exercise intensity increased from 60 to 70% in the initial two weeks to 70–80% during the final ten weeks [ 70 51 71 72 50 69 70 73 52 74 76 77 49 75 3.4. Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment To assess the risk of bias in the included randomized controlled trials, we utilized the RoB 2.0 assessment tool. The analysis was meticulously reviewed by our two researchers, with the outcomes thoroughly deliberated upon. Drawing from the Cochrane Collaboration’s criteria for determining the risk of bias outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 62 49 73 50 69 75 51 52 70 71 72 74 76 77 Figure 2 Supplementary Table S3 3.5. Primary Outcome Among the 13 studies included in the meta-analysis, 2 studies did not provide detailed data on depression symptom scores and 11 studies suggested exercise alleviated depressive symptoms, with 8 studies showing statistical significance. Our findings demonstrated that exercise significantly improved depressive symptoms (SMD = −0.59, 95%CI: [−0.86, −0.32], I 2 p Figure 3 70 2 p Supplementary Figure S1 Among the 13 articles reviewed, three categories of peripheral biomarkers were reported, with CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 being the most commonly reported. Meta-analysis revealed that exercise did not reduce the levels of CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α (CRP, MD = −1.00, 95%CI: [−2.87, 0.88], I 2 p 2 p 2 p Figure 3 Supplementary Table S5 Supplementary Figure S2 and Tables S4 and S6 Six trials were incorporated into the meta-analysis of CRP, with four studies suggesting that exercise might reduce CRP levels, though only one study reached statistical significance. The pooled results showed no significant association between exercise and CRP levels (MD = −1.00, 95%CI: [−2.87, 0.88], I 2 p 2 The meta-analysis of IL-6 encompassed 10 eligible studies: 7 trials suggested exercise might lower IL-6 levels, with 3 studies achieving statistical significance. Our study found no notable association between exercise and IL-6 levels (MD = −0.34, 95%CI: [−1.17, 0.48], I 2 p Seven trials were incorporated into the meta-analysis of TNF-α: one study reported exercise increased TNF-α with statistical significance, while one study showed the opposite trend. The results indicated no significant association between exercise and TNF-α levels (MD = 0.74, 95%CI: [−0.98, 2.45], I 2 p 2 3.6. Subgroup Analysis We conducted subgroup analyses based on factors including age, severity of depression, presence or absence of comorbidities, exercise type, exercise intensity, frequency, and length. Subgroup analyses revealed that the sample’s age, proportion of females, severity of depression, presence or absence of comorbidities, and exercise type, intensity and frequency demonstrated a minimal to negligible impact on the exercise-induced changes in biomarker concentrations in the bloodstream. However, durations of 8–12 weeks were associated with a significant reduction in the level of TNF-α (n = 86; MD = −0.73, 95%CI: [−1.30, −0.17], I 2 p Table 2 Supplementary Figures S3–S5 3.7. Meta-Regression Analysis To further explore the sources of heterogeneity, meta-regression analyses were conducted. Univariable analyses revealed differential response patterns of inflammatory biomarkers to exercise intervention characteristics. For CRP (k = 6) and IL-6 (k = 10), none of the analyses reached statistical significance. TNF-α (k = 7) exhibited the most distinct response pattern, with exercise length showing a significant positive correlation with TNF-α levels in a linear model (β = 0.24, p 2 2 Given the apparent inconsistency of the positive linear relationship between exercise duration and TNF-α, we formally tested for non-linearity. A quadratic model provided a markedly better fit than linear specification (ΔAIC = 6.77, ΔBIC = 8.06) with significant curvature ( p 2 2 Figure S6 Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 and Figure S6 4. Discussion In our study, we identified 13 RCTs involving 1004 participants. We examined the impacts of exercise interventions with varying degrees of intensity, type, frequency, and length on the levels of peripheral proinflammatory factors and depressive symptom among patients with depression. The findings of our research showed that exercise intervention could improve depression scale scores in individuals with depression, but overall, exercise intervention did not affect the level of inflammatory factors. However, subgroup analysis showed that exercise intervention lasting 8–12 weeks decreased levels of TNF-α. Nevertheless, univariable regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive association between intervention length and TNF-α levels. This conflict suggests non-linear biological responses where 8–12 weeks represents an optimal window for TNF-α reduction, while longer durations may induce compensatory inflammatory processes. The antidepressant effects of exercise have been confirmed, and it may even exert potential protective effects, making it a viable adjunctive treatment for depression [ 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 Our findings revealed that exercise had no statistically significant effect on inflammatory marker levels. This finding aligns with the results obtained by previous research. One meta-analysis suggested that long-term exercise interventions do not significantly modulate baseline IL-6 and IL-1β [ 90 52 91 92 93 52 94 95 96 97 98 The results of subgroup analysis suggested that 8–12 weeks of exercise intervention is associated with a reduction in TNF-α levels in patients with depression. However, the results of univariable regression indicated that studies with longer exercise lengths showed a higher level of TNF-α. Synthesizing the above outcomes, the peak of exercise-induced improvement of TNF-α levels appeared around 8–12 weeks in patients with depression. The temporal dimension of intervention efficacy on TNF-α exhibits non-linear characteristics: short-term programs (median 9 weeks, range 4–15 weeks) are not sufficient to initiate anti-inflammatory adaptations [ 90 90 99 80 99 There is evidence that IL-6 exerts a dual regulatory role on TNF-α through dichotomous signaling by promoting TNF-α release in proinflammatory states, yet suppressing it via pathways such as TLR/NF-κB inhibition in response to exercise [ 100 101 102 103 45 104 105 106 There are substantial discrepancies between our meta-regression results and subgroup analysis findings. Specifically, in univariate regression analysis, intervention length was significantly positively correlated with TNF-α levels, which is contrary to some previous evidence, while subgroup analysis suggested a potential non-linear or threshold effect. These divergences may arise from methodological differences between the two approaches: subgroup analysis examines discrete categories and emphasizes between-group differences, whereas standard meta-regression models continuous variables under a linearity assumption. Notably, quadratic and restricted cubic spline terms revealed a significant non-linear relationship that neither initial method fully captured. This curve, characterized by a reduction in TNF-α up to 8–12 weeks followed by a gradual increase, helps reconcile the contradictions and highlights the limitation of applying linear models to inherently non-linear biological responses. Furthermore, other significant subgroup findings were not retained in multivariable meta-regression. This may be attributed to several factors: reduced statistical power in smaller subgroups; confounding by unmeasured variables such as exercise intensity or type, or timing of biomarker measurement (acute or chronic phase); and multicollinearity among moderators, which can inflate variance and obscure true effects. Importantly, the low explanatory power (adjusted R 2 2 This meta-analysis offers several advantages over prior work: First, we have comprehensively revised and synthesized the outcomes of various exercise programs (type, intensity, length, and frequency) on peripheral proinflammatory factor levels in all adult populations with depression [ 90 107 5. Conclusions Our meta-analysis supports that exercise exerts a positive influence on depressive symptoms, whereas its effects on peripheral inflammatory markers remain uncertain due to high heterogeneity and potential unmeasured moderators. Subgroup and non-linear analyses suggest that interventions of 8–12 weeks may be linked to reductions in TNF-α, but this finding should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited and uneven distribution of the studies. Although exercise seems to confer mood-boosting benefits, further rigorous research is necessary to determine whether its antidepressant properties are tied to inflammation. Future studies should employ more robust methodologies, extend trial length, account for participants’ medication use, and include proper control groups that do not involve exercise. Furthermore, the detection of integrating CNS biomarkers will be essential to explore the peripheral/central connection. Only through such comprehensive investigations can we truly establish if exercise’s mental health benefits operate through inflammatory pathways.
