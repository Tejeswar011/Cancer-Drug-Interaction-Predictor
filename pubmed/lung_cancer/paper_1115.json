Genetic variations play a significant role in determining an individual’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and progress to severe disease. This pilot study provides an experimental approach using WES to identify certain rare and novel genetic variants that might affect an individual’s susceptibility to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, offering an initial exploration of these genetic variants. In the study cohort with 16 patients, the mortality rate was higher in male patients due to severe disease. There was a substantial burden of comorbidity, including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and T2DM, conditions which independently increase the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. A total of 4478 variants were identified, distributed across 322 genes within the cohort. The majority of these variants were missense substitutions along with frameshift variants, inframe insertions/deletions (indels), and nonsense variants. The variants were further categorized by types to include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), deletions (DEL), and insertions (INS).

Introduction The emergence of COVID-19 in 2020 marked a significant turning point in global health, with millions of lives lost in the pandemic across the world [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 2. Methodology 2.1. Study Subjects and Selection Criteria This case series study investigated a specific cohort of patients afflicted with severe COVID-19, aiming to unravel the underlying genetic predispositions contributing to extreme disease phenotypes. From a larger pool of 115 COVID-19 patients admitted to two prominent tertiary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia—King Fahad Hospital in Tabuk City and King Abdullah Hospital in Bisha City—a focused subgroup of 16 unrelated individuals was carefully chosen. These patients were recruited between February 2021 and June 2021, a period marked by significant SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. The selection of these 16 patients was based on their severe COVID-19 symptoms. Notably, 75% of them needed to be admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The inclusion criteria were defined to ensure consistency within the selected cohort. Patients had to be middle-aged to old-aged, specifically above 35 years, reflecting a demographic often associated with increased COVID-19 severity. A definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was paramount, confirmed by a positive result on real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR detection kit (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Crucially, all included patients presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening complication of COVID-19, regardless of their outcome (survivors or deceased). To mitigate potential confounding factors, individuals who had received any SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prior to admission were excluded, ensuring that the observed phenotypes were purely a result of natural infection and host response. Conversely, patients under 35 years of age were systematically excluded from the study. A comprehensive, structured questionnaire was administered to all enrolled subjects to gather a rich array of epidemiological and demographic data. This included detailed information on their medical history, specifically focusing on pre-existing conditions known to influence COVID-19 severity, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, the questionnaire explored lifestyle factors, including addiction habits, with particular attention to smoking history. A thorough family history of other significant illnesses was also documented to provide a holistic view of potential genetic predispositions. For Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES), a critical component of this genetic investigation, a peripheral blood sample of approximately 2 mL was collected from each patient. These samples were drawn into EDTA tubes to preserve DNA integrity and immediately stored at −20 °C to prevent degradation until subsequent analysis. The ethical conduct of this study was of utmost importance. All procedures adhered strictly to regional regulations and were broadly compliant with the foundational principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Ethical approvals were meticulously secured from the institutional ethics committees at the University of Bisha (Ref. no. UBCOM/H-06-BH-087(05/25)) and King Khalid University, Abha (Ref. no. H-06-B-091). Furthermore, explicit written informed consent was obtained from every participant before their involvement in the study, underscoring the commitment to patient autonomy and ethical research practices. 2.2. Genomic DNA and Library Preparation High-quality human genomic DNA was used as the starting material for this study. Exome capture libraries were generated using the Twist Exome Panel 2.0 kit (Twist Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. This panel is specifically designed to capture a total of 36.8 Mb of human protein-coding genes. This process involved the following steps: enzymatic fragmentation of genomic DNA to produce fragments of optimal size for sequencing; ligation of specific adapter sequences to the DNA fragments to facilitate sequencing; hybridization of the adapter-ligated fragments to a pool of biotinylated oligonucleotide probes targeting human exonic regions; capture of the hybridized fragments using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads; and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to enrich the captured exonic DNA fragments, thereby creating the sequencing library. The resulting libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and library fragment size distribution was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 2.3. Next-Generation Sequencing Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The prepared exome capture libraries were loaded onto the flow cell at the recommended concentration, and paired-end sequencing was performed. The specific sequencing parameters, including read length (2 × 150 bp) and index read configuration, were set according to the Twist 2.0 Exome kit protocol to ensure optimal data generation. Raw sequencing data was generated in FASTQ format. 2.4. Quality Control and Preprocessing of Sequencing Reads The quality of the raw sequencing reads was assessed using FastQC v0.11.9 [ 13 14 15 2.5. Read Mapping The high-quality, trimmed reads were mapped to the hg38 human reference genome assembly using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM) version 0.7.17 [ 16 17 2.6. Variant Discovery and Annotation Variant discovery was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v4.3 [ 18 19 20 21 Furthermore, population frequency information was compiled from several large-scale population databases to distinguish pathogenic variants from common polymorphisms. These databases included the 1000 Genomes Project [ 22 23 24 For functional prediction of the potential impact of missense variants, in silico prediction tools were used. These included SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 2.7. Variant Filtering and Classification To explore the genetic basis of COVID-19 susceptibility and identify relevant variants, we started by examining genes specifically included in the “COVID-19 research (Version 1.142)” panel of the Genomics England PanelApp [ 33 34 22 Variants were annotated using ClinVar [ 21 35 Variant classification was performed using the InterVar software tool [ 36 37 2.8. Protein–Protein Interaction Network Analysis A curated list of genes harboring pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) was subjected to protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. This analysis was performed using the STRING database, version 12.0 [ 38 To obtain the interaction data, a downloadable tabular file (.tsv format) was acquired through the database’s “Exports” interface. The Homo sapiens Network visualization and further analysis were performed using Cytoscape version 3.10.1 [ 39 40 2.9. Functional Enrichment Analysis Functional enrichment analysis of the constructed protein–protein network was performed using the STRING database’s online analysis tool [ 38 The STRING database was used to enrich the network genes across a comprehensive range of functional categories, including: Biological Process (Gene Ontology), Molecular Function (Gene Ontology), Cellular Component (Gene Ontology), Reference Publications (PubMed), Local Network Cluster (STRING), KEGG Pathways, Reactome Pathways, WikiPathways, Disease-Gene Association (DISEASE), Tissue Expression (TISSUES), Subcellular Localization (COMPARTMENTS), Annotated Keywords (UniProt), Protein Domain and Feature (InterPro), and Protein Domain (SMART). For each enriched term, the STRING analysis provides several statistical measures: (1) Count in-network: (2) Strength: (3) Signal: (4) False Discovery Rate (FDR): For this study, Gene Ontology—Biological Process, Reactome Pathways, Disease-Gene Association, and Annotated Keywords (UniProt) categories were selected for enrichment representation, as these categories provide key insights into the biological functions, pathways, disease relevance, and protein features of the network genes. Enriched terms within each category were sorted based on their Signal value, prioritizing the most significant enrichments. To reduce redundancy, terms with a similarity score of 0.8 or greater (indicating substantial overlap in associated genes) were grouped together. The top 10 most significant terms from each selected category were then chosen for presentation, providing a concise overview of the key functional enrichments within the network. 3. Results 3.1. Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Patients This exploratory study investigated the clinical characteristics of a cohort comprising 16 patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 symptoms. The cohort included 9 female patients (56.3%) and 7 male patients (43.8%). The clinical outcomes varied, with 8 patients (50%) achieving full recovery and subsequent discharge, while 8 patients (50%) experienced fatal outcomes due to severe disease complications. The median duration of hospital stay for the entire cohort was 12 days, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 9 to 16 days. Among those requiring intensive care, the median length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was 9 days (IQR: 5–12). The median age of the patient cohort was 59 years (IQR: 50–69). The most frequently reported respiratory symptom was cough, present in 14 out of 16 patients (88%), followed by fever, which was observed in 10 patients (63%). Pre-existing comorbidities were common, with hypertension being the most prevalent, affecting 12 patients (75%). Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 5 patients (31%), and chronic kidney disease was present in 1 patient (6.3%). Notably, all patients (100%) received treatment involving immunosuppressive steroids and/or antiviral medications. The primary clinical characteristics of this patient cohort are summarized in Table 1 3.2. Identification of COVID-19-Specific Variants in Cohort The “COVID-19 research (Version 1.142)” gene panel is an ongoing research effort aiming to catalog genes associated with susceptibility to viral infections, encompassing SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. This panel categorizes genes based on the strength of evidence supporting their involvement. Genes with high levels of evidence and expert review are designated as “Green.” In the specified version of the panel, there were 697 entities, of which 461 genes were classified as “Green”. These 461 genes were used to prioritize variants identified in Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) data. Following the filtering of synonymous and intronic variants, a total of 4478 variants were identified, distributed across 322 genes. The majority of these variants were missense substitutions (n = 4046, 90%). Additionally, the dataset included 160 frameshift variants, 95 inframe insertions/deletions (indels), and 54 nonsense variants. ( Figure 1 HLA-DRB1 HLA-B ABO HPS4 SP110 3.3. Identification of Rare Candidate Variants in the Cohort Following population frequency-based filtering and annotation according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, 267 rare candidate variants were identified across 125 genes. Missense variants were the most frequent (n = 221, 83%), followed by frameshift variants (n = 20, 7.5%), nonsense variants (n = 15, 5.5%), and inframe insertions/deletions (n = 11, 4%). ACMG classification revealed that the majority of these variants were classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) (n = 210, 79%). Additionally, 30 variants were classified as likely benign (LB), 9 as benign (B), 12 as likely pathogenic (LP), and 9 as pathogenic (P). Of the total variants, 214 had been previously reported, while 53 were classified as novel. The HLA-B AK2 IRF7 KMT2D TAP1 HLA-DRB1 TAP1 AK2 G6PC3 HLA-B IL12RB2 ITGB2 Figure 2 Analysis of patient samples showed that AK2 HLA-B HLA-DRB1 IL2RB LYST SLX4 Figure 3 3.4. Rare Candidate Pathogenic Variants in the Cohort A total of 18 rare candidate variants were classified as either pathogenic (n = 6) or likely pathogenic (n = 12) within the study cohort. The AK2 variant (p.185delinsTS) was recurrent, observed in two patients, and the HLA-DRB1 variant (p.E198Gfs18) was present in three patients. Additional variants classified as pathogenic included FANCA (p.E1254Gfs23), KMT2D (p.Q3735X), SLX4 (p.Q365Sfs32), SPINK5 (p.K824Efs4), and XRCC2 (p.L117Ffs6). Variants classified as likely pathogenic were found in AK2 (p.185delinsTS and p.I167Mfs8), CD3G (p.K71Nfs40), FANCA (p.K921I), FANCL (p.Q75X), HLA-B (p.T202Afs18), HLA-DRB1 (p.E198Gfs*18), TCF3 (p.V595I), and TLR4 (p.R731X). Notably, the TCF3 variant (p.V595I) represents a novel likely pathogenic variant not previously reported in existing databases. Among these, FANCA (p.E1254Gfs23), FANCL (p.Q75X), and HLA-B (p.T202Afs18) were observed to be homozygous, while all other identified variants were heterozygous ( Table 2 Table 3 3.5. Protein–Protein Interaction Network Analysis A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to analyze the relationships among the identified genes. This network specifically included genes harboring pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Genes with benign or likely benign variants were excluded from this analysis, as our focus was on variants with the potential to alter gene functionality. We opted to include VUS in the network despite their lack of conclusive evidence for pathogenicity. By definition, VUS are “of uncertain significance” precisely because there is not enough data to definitively classify them as benign or pathogenic. This inherent uncertainty suggests they could still exert a functional impact on their respective proteins. Including these variants in the PPI network allowed us to explore whether the proteins they encode interact with other proteins already known to be involved in relevant disease pathways or biological processes. The resulting network comprised 108 genes. The PPI network, generated using the STRING database, exhibited 108 nodes (representing the genes) and 394 edges (representing the interactions between the genes). The average node degree, a measure of the average number of interactions per gene, was 7.3. The average local clustering coefficient, which quantifies the tendency of nodes to cluster together, was 0.532. A PPI enrichment p −16 Hub gene analysis, employing the degree algorithm to identify highly connected nodes, revealed key genes within the network. The top 20 hub genes, ranked in descending order of connectivity, were: STAT1 TLR4 PTPRC BRCA2 PRKDC FANCM IL17A PALB2 FANCA RAD51C PTEN FANCD2 POLE XRCC2 POLD1 SLX4 TERT NLRP3 IRF7 TGFB1 Figure 4 3.6. Functional Enrichment Analysis Functional enrichment analysis of the constructed protein–protein interaction network revealed that the identified genes are primarily enriched in pathways associated with immune deficiency and DNA repair. Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process analysis showed significant enrichment in processes such as positive regulation of immune response ( p −22 p −16 p −16 p −9 p −21 p −6 p −12 p −6 p −30 p −14 p −29 p −13 p −11 Figure 5 Consistent with these findings, enrichment of UniProt keywords revealed associations with Fanconi anemia ( p −11 p −12 p −10 p −7 p −10 Table 4 4. Discussion Several factors contribute to the susceptibility towards SARS-CoV-2 infections and its severity including genetics, gender and comorbidity. Men generally experience more severe COVID-19 outcomes and higher mortality rates compared to women [ 41 42 43 44 45 HLA-B -C -F -DQA1 -DRB1 -DRB5 The study cohort has shown substantial burden of comorbidity in COVID-19 patients including hypertension, ischemic heart disease and T2DM. Such comorbid conditions have been identified as significant determinants of COVID-19 as each of these independently increases the risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients [ 46 47 48 49 50 Host genetic factors play a crucial role in determining the diverse responses observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Genetic variability is a significant determinant in both an individual’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 outcomes [ 9 HLA-DRB1 HLA-B ABO HPS4 SP110 HLA-B AK2 IRF7 KMT2D TAP1 HLA-DRB1 TAP1 AK2 G6PC3 HLA-B IL12RB2 ITGB2 Further, as mentioned our filtering process was designed to remove common variants using a 1% minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold in major public databases. This step is a key substitute for a population-matched control group in exploratory studies like ours. By removing variants with a MAF > 1%, we significantly increase the likelihood that our identified variants are indeed rare and not a common feature of any given population, including the Saudi population. To further substantiate this, we compared our identified variants with frequency data from a comprehensive public database, specifically focusing on the Middle Eastern population and the overall combined population. As shown in the attached Table 3 For example: The AK2 variants, which were observed in multiple patients, have a frequency of 0 in the control population data. The HLA-DRB1 variant, a key finding, also has a frequency of 0. Other variants like those in C6, CD3G, and SPINK5 have very low frequencies (e.g., 0.0032, 0.0006, and 0.00022, respectively) and are completely absent in the Middle Eastern population data shown. This data suggests that the variants we have identified are not common indigenous polymorphisms but are indeed rare. Therefore, their presence in our cohort of severe COVID-19 patients is a compelling finding that warrants further investigation. Specific gene variants, including those within the HLA-DRB, HLA-B, and ABO blood group systems, have been linked to varying degrees of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 [ 51 52 53 54 55 56 51 57 58 59 60 61 62 Some important genes have been shown to have rare and novel variants in the cohort and are involved in a variety of cellular processes that are crucial for executing an effective immune response against viral infections. For instance, Interferon Regulatory Factor 7 (IRF7) is a key transcription factor that plays a central role in regulating the expression of type I interferons (IFNs), which are critical components of the innate immune response to viral infections [ 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 72 73 74 75 76 77 5. Conclusions Understanding the genetic variables that determine both susceptibility to COVID-19 and illness severity is critical. This pilot study, through its preliminary data derived from a limited sample size, offers important insights into the disease’s underlying mechanisms by identifying potential pathogenic gene variations linked to an increased incidence and severity of COVID-19. Continued study is needed to validate these findings, better understand the complex connections between genetic variables and COVID-19, and investigate potential targeted treatments based on individual genetic profiles. By understanding the significance of gene variations, a personalized approach can be established to reduce risk, improve preventive interventions, and improve outcomes for people who are more likely to contract severe COVID-19. 6. Limitations of the Study The research presented in the manuscript corresponds to a pilot study. In this regard, it should be noted that the sample size is small. Moreover, the objective of the study was to identify novel and known genetic variations within the COVID-19 patient cohort in order to acknowledge host genetic factors in the risk and severity of the infection. Therefore, healthy controls were not included in the study. Moreover, the small sample size limits the statistical power and generalizability of our findings, making them mainly hypothesis-generating. Our use of Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) is helpful for detecting exonic variants, but it does not enable thorough HLA typing or a complete analysis of the highly variable HLA region. This means we missed important non-exonic or full HLA allele variations. Finally, since this is an observational study, it cannot show direct causality, and we may not have fully addressed potential confounding factors. These limitations highlight the need for further studies using a large patient cohort and healthy controls to validate the plausible relationship of the genetic variants with the disease pathology.
