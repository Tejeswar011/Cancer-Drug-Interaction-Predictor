Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is a key pathological driver ofCKD progression. This study aimed to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutictargets. Research design and methods Weanalyzed the GEO dataset GSE137570 Results FiveHub Genes (EGF, VCAN, CXCL1, MMP7, CCL2) were identified, with CCL2 being themost central. Enrichment analyses linked them to immune/inflammatory responses.DLRA confirmed specific targeting between miR-124-3p and both NEAT1 and CCL2,supporting the NEAT1/miR-124-3p/CCL2 axis. Clinically, serum CCL2 increasedwhile miR-124-3p and NEAT1 decreased with CKD progression; all three showedgood diagnostic accuracy for staging. Conclusions EGF,VCAN, CXCL1, MMP7, and particularly CCL2 are potential CKDbiomarkers/therapeutic targets. The NEAT1/miR-124-3p/CCL2 axis is a keyregulatory pathway in CKD. Key limitations include the moderate sample sizes inbioinformatics and clinical cohorts. Plain Language Summary Doctors lack good tests to track how chronic kidneydisease (CKD) gets worse over time. By studying kidney patient data, we firstfound five important substances in the body linked to CKD getting worse. One ofthese, called CCL2, had the strongest connection to the disease. To learn how CCL2 is controlled, we studied two othermolecules that might affect it: NEAT1 (a longer molecule) and miR-124-3p (a smaller one). Our tests showed that NEAT1 “catches” miR-124-3p, stopping itfrom reducing CCL2. When we checked blood levels in 64 CKD patients, we sawthat as kidney function got worse, NEAT1 and miR-124-3p went down while CCL2went up. These findings could lead to new blood tests tomonitor CKD and may help develop future treatments.

Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a significant global public health challenge. Epidemiological studies indicate that CKD accounts for approximately 1.2 million annual deaths worldwide, with mortality rates continuing to rise. Projections suggest it will become the fifth leading cause of death by 2040 [ 1 2 Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) constitutes both the common pathological pathway and primary pathological basis for progression of CKD to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [ 3 4 5 6 7 Renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), as primary targets of metabolic, immune, ischemic, and toxic insults, mount diverse responses to cellular stress or injury. These include proliferation, autophagy, growth arrest, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and various forms of cell death. Such responses trigger inflammatory cell infiltration, fibroblast activation/proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, tubular atrophy, and microvascular rarefaction, thereby initiating RIF progression. This cascade ultimately drives decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and progression to ESRD [ 8 9 Consequently, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying RIF pathogenesis and developing effective therapeutic interventions are crucial for delaying CKD progression and reducing ESRD burden. However, CKD presents dual clinical challenges due to its insidious onset, multifactorial etiology, and heterogeneous pathogenesis: limited early diagnostic capability and inadequate therapeutic options. Current clinical guidelines advocate multi-target therapies including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) [ 10 11 12 Emerging evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are detectable in diverse biofluids (e.g., serum, plasma, urine). Their expression profiles may reflect systemic responses to pathophysiological stress, mediating cellular activation, proliferation, transformation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and renal fibrosis progression [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21–23 miR-124-3p, a critical miRNA expressed in immune cells and multiple organs, is activated by inflammatory signals and functions as a homeostatic negative regulator. Its dysregulation is recognized as a key modulator of immune cell function, inflammation, and immune responses [ 24 25 26 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), a CC-subfamily cytokine secreted by diverse cell types (e.g., macrophages, monocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, mesangial cells, TECs, smooth muscle cells), binds to its cognate receptor CCR2 to promote immune cell migration/activation, thereby exacerbating inflammation and fibrosis [ 27 28 The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, curated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), represents a large-scale public repository archiving high-throughput gene expression data from global research institutions. It encompasses single- and dual-channel microarray experiments alongside non-array-based methodologies, including Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), mass spectrometry proteomics, and high-throughput sequencing data [ 29 GSE137570 Figure 1 Figure 1.

Enrichment analysis of DEGs Enrichment analysis of DEGs across comparison groups was performed using NetworkAnalyst, Metascape, and WebGestalt databases. In Group 1, GO-BP terms were significantly enriched in leukocyte activation and regulation; GO-CC terms localized to the outer plasma membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM); GO-MF involved chemokine/cytokine receptor activity, including G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) binding. KEGG pathway analysis highlighted cell adhesion molecules and chemokine signaling pathways, indicating coordinated immune cell recruitment and ECM remodeling drive renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) progression (Supplementary Figure S3). Group 2 exhibited GO-BP enrichment in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1)-mediated responses; GO-CC enrichment in dendritic structures (e.g., spines); GO-MF dominated by cytokine binding activity. KEGG analysis linked to IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways, reflecting neuroimmune crosstalk that exacerbates tissue injury via inflammatory cascades (Supplementary Figure S4). Group 3 displayed GO-BP enrichment in small molecule and carboxylic acid catabolic processes; GO-CC enrichment in collagen-dense ECM (distinct from Group 1); GO-MF indicating redox enzyme dysregulation. KEGG analysis highlighted immunoglobulin A (IgA)-mediated gut immunity and allograft rejection pathways, suggesting metabolic disturbances potentiate injury through the gut-kidney axis (Supplementary Figure S5). Group 4 featured GO-BP enrichment in B cell-mediated immunity; GO-CC enrichment in stromal compartments (shared features with Group 3) alongside GO-MF enrichment in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II binding. KEGG analysis revealed enrichment in autoimmune pathways (e.g., Type 1 diabetes), indicating late-stage adaptive immune dysregulation (Supplementary Figure S6). Cross-group analysis of shared DEGs identified conserved inflammatory Hub Genes: GO-BP enrichment encompassed cytokine-mediated responses (e.g., IL-17 signaling) and cell motility regulation, suggesting synergy between immune trafficking and inflammatory signaling; GO-CC enrichment in secretory vesicles and luminal compartments (e.g., perinuclear regions) implied exosome-mediated cytokine storage and intercellular transfer; GO-MF centered on cytokine/receptor binding, amplifying inflammatory cascades. Integrated pathway analysis converged on chronic inflammatory circuitry. IL-17/TNF-α signaling fuels innate immunity (Group 2), metabolic dysregulation (Group 3), and autoimmunity (Group 4), establishing trans-group pathological networks. Pan-group enrichment of rheumatoid arthritis pathways suggests targeting shared nodes (e.g., JAK-STAT, IL-17A) may concurrently mitigate fibrosis and autoimmunity, informing cross-stage therapeutic strategies ( Figure 2(D-G) These results establish a conserved dysregulation of inflammatory and immune responses across progressive stages of CKD, underscoring their central mechanistic role in driving CKD pathogenesis. 3.3. GSVA Analysis Based on the comparative GSVA analysis between Control and Trial groups across four independent cohorts using MSigDB Hallmark gene sets, we observed the following specific pathway alterations. In Group 1, the TRIAL group exhibited significant upregulation of fatty acid metabolism and bile acid metabolism, coupled with downregulation of the peroxisome pathway relative to the CONTROL group ( Figure 2(H) Group 2 demonstrated robust activation of hypoxia signaling and glycolysis in the TRIAL group, while oxidative phosphorylation was suppressed (Supplementary Figure 7A). Group 3 revealed comprehensive upregulation of inflammation-related pathways in the TRIAL group, including TNFA signaling via NFKB, complement system activation, and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling (Supplementary Figure 7B). Group 4 displayed a distinct dual effect in the TRIAL group: sustained activation of hypoxia signaling alongside potentiated KRAS signaling and EMT, whereas DNA repair pathway activity was suppressed (Supplementary Figure 7C). These GSVA results collectively delineate distinct molecular signatures across CKD progression stages: an early shift toward metabolic reprogramming (Groups 1–2), a pronounced inflammatory surge in mid-stage disease (Group 3), and a late-stage activation of pro-fibrotic signaling alongside impaired DNA repair (Group 4), highlighting the dynamic evolution of pathogenic pathways during CKD advancement. 3.4. Construction of PPI network Expression profiles of 35 DEGs across all four experimental groups were analyzed using the STRING 12.0 database to construct a PPI network ( Figure 2(I) Figure 2(J-K) Due to technical heterogeneity in Group 4, a secondary PPI network was constructed using DEGs exclusively from Groups 1–3. Subsequent Cytohubba and MCC analyses identified LAMC2, CCL22, CXCL1, CXCL6, EGF, VCAN, CCL2, and MMP7 as Hub Genes (Supplementary Figure 8). Notably, MMP7, VCAN, CXCL1, CCL2, and EGF were consistently prioritized across both analytical frameworks. The CCL2 cluster again demonstrated maximal size and node centrality, reinforcing its biological significance in disease progression. Together, these results demonstrate that PPI network analysis and Hub Gene screening established MMP7, VCAN, CXCL1, CCL2, and EGF as key regulators of CKD progression, with CCL2 occupying the topologically central position. 3.5. Screening of Hub-associated miRnas and prediction of target lncRnas Hub-related miRNAs were screened using MiRWalk and miRTarBase databases. Intersection analysis identified seven EGF-associated miRNAs: hsa-miR-665, hsa-miR-1304-5p, hsa-miR-1827, hsa-miR-4722-5p, hsa-miR-6765-5p, hsa-miR-6840-3p, and hsa-miR-6884-5p. Two VCAN-associated miRNAs were identified: hsa-miR-103a-3p and hsa-miR-107. A single CXCL1-linked miRNA was detected: hsa-miR-196b-5p. Three MMP7-associated miRNAs were identified: hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-4697-5p, and hsa-miR-7109-5p. CCL2 was associated with one miRNA: hsa-miR-124-3p (miRNA predictions in Supplementary Table S3). Further, ENCORI and MiRNET databases were used to predict lncRNAs associated with hub miRNAs. Results showed no relevant lncRNAs were retrieved for hsa-miR-1304-5p, hsa-miR-1827, hsa-miR-4722-5p, hsa-miR-6765-5p, hsa-miR-6840-3p, hsa-miR-4697-5p, or hsa-miR-7109-5p. hsa-miR-665 was ultimately associated with 24 lncRNAs. hsa-miR-6884-5p with 16 lncRNAs. hsa-miR-103a-3p with 16 lncRNAs. hsa-miR-107 with 16 lncRNAs. hsa-miR-196b-5p with 12 lncRNAs. hsa-miR-34a-5p with 13 lncRNAs. hsa-miR-124-3p with 10 lncRNAs. Among these, NEAT1 exhibited the highest CLIP Experiment Number (clipExpNum), Degradation Experiment Number (degraExpNum), and Phylogenetic P P Figure 3 Figure 3. Predicted competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network for Hub genes. The network depicts the predicted regulatory interactions. Orange nodes: diseases, green nodes: hub genes (EGF, VCAN, CXCL1, MMP7, CCL2), pink nodes: miRnas predicted to target the hubs, blue nodes: lncRnas predicted to interact with the miRnas. Lines represent predicted interactions (miRNA-mRNA or lncRNA-miRNA). These results demonstrate the successful prediction of potential regulatory miRNAs for the identified Hub Genes and construction of corresponding ceRNA networks. Notably, the miR-124-3p/CCL2 and NEAT1/miR-124-3p regulatory relationships exhibit high prediction confidence, suggesting that the NEAT1/miR-124-3p/CCL2 axis may constitute a critical ceRNA regulatory pathway. 3.6.

Correlation between Hub genes and immune cells Using the CIBERSORT algorithm in the TIMER 2.0 database, we analyzed differences in immune cell infiltration across renal tissue groups and assessed correlations between differentially infiltrated cells and Hub Genes. Group 1 exhibited significant differences in B cells naive, T cells CD4 + + Figure 4(A-B) Figure 4.

Significant immune cell subtypes ( p R .* p p p p Group 2 displayed significant monocyte differences between CKD and controls, with all Hub Genes showing moderate correlations (Supplementary Figure 9A, D). Group 3 showed significant monocyte differences; VCAN, CXCL1, MMP7, and CCL2 had moderate correlations, while EGF exhibited weak correlation (Supplementary Figure 9B, E). Group 4 demonstrated significant differences in CD4 + These results collectively indicate that the landscape of immune cell infiltration in renal tissue exhibits significant differences across various stages of CKD progression. Moreover, the expression of Hub Genes demonstrates significant correlations with the infiltration abundance of multiple immune cell subtypes, suggesting a cooperative interplay between alterations in the immune microenvironment and Hub Gene expression during CKD progression. 3.8. ROC curve analysis of Hub genes in GSE137570 ROC curve analysis of Hub Genes in the GSE137570 Figure 4(C) These results collectively confirm that EGF, VCAN, CXCL1, MMP7, and CCL2 all demonstrate superior diagnostic performance across distinct groups within the GSE137570 3.9. Validation of Hub gene expression Validation of the selected Hub Genes was performed using single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Single Cell Portal database and further confirmed through in vitro experiments ( Figure 4(D-G) Immunofluorescence detection revealed that α-SMA, a transmembrane protein, exhibited positive signals primarily localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasmic regions. Positive expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin was mainly observed at the cell membrane and within cell junctions and adherens junctions. Compared to the control group, the TGF-β1-induced model group showed significantly increased fluorescence intensity for α-SMA and N-cadherin, while the E-cadherin fluorescence signal was markedly attenuated (Supplementary Figure 10). RT-qPCR results further validated these model characteristics: the model group exhibited significantly upregulated mRNA expression of α-SMA and N-cadherin and significantly downregulated mRNA expression of E-cadherin, confirming the successful establishment of the renal tubular epithelial cell transdifferentiation model (The RT-qPCR data are presented in Supplementary Table S5). EGF validation results demonstrated significantly lower renal tissue EGF expression in the Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Nephritis, Adriamycin Nephropathy, Diabetic Kidney Disease, and CD2AP Knockout models compared to the normal control group. In vitro experiments similarly showed significantly reduced EGF mRNA expression. VCAN validation results indicated significantly elevated VCAN expression in the Anti-GBM and Adriamycin Nephropathy models, but no significant changes in the Diabetic Kidney Disease and CD2AP models. In vitro experiments revealed significantly upregulated VCAN mRNA expression in the model group. CXCL1 validation results showed significantly increased expression across all kidney disease models. In vitro experiments demonstrated significantly upregulated CXCL1 mRNA expression in the model group. MMP7 validation results showed consistently low expression levels without significant changes in all in vivo models. However, in vitro experiments demonstrated significant upregulation of MMP7 mRNA in the model group. To further investigate MMP7 expression in the RIF model, we employed a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model to mimic the RIF microenvironment. Western blot analysis revealed markedly increased MMP7 protein expression in renal tissues of the model group, consistent with the in vitro results (Supplementary Figure S11). CCL2 validation results showed significantly increased expression only in the Anti-GBM model, with no significant changes in other models. In vitro experiments indicated significantly upregulated CCL2 mRNA expression in the model group. By combining single-cell sequencing with in vitro experimental validation, the expression patterns of Hub Genes were consistent with predictions from previous analyses.Given that CCL2 exhibited the highest node centrality within the PPI network, and its predicted sole associated miR-124-3p and upstream lncRNA NEAT1 demonstrated the highest confidence within the ceRNA network, subsequent investigations in this study will focus on CCL2 and its regulatory pathway NEAT1/miR-124-3p for in-depth mechanistic validation and exploration of clinical significance. 3.10. Targeting interaction of miR-124-3p with NEAT1 and CCL2 To validate the specific regulatory axis between NEAT1/miR-124-3p and miR-124-3p/CCL2, dual-luciferase reporter vectors containing wild-type (WT) or mutant (MUT) miR-124-3p binding sites in NEAT1 and CCL2 were constructed. DLRAs revealed that miR-124-3p mimic transfection significantly suppressed the relative luciferase activity of NEAT1-WT and CCL2-WT compared to other co-transfection groups, confirming direct targeting interactions between miR-124-3p and NEAT1/CCL2 ( Figure 5(A-C) Figure 5. (A) schematic representation of the pmirGLO dual-luciferase vector constructs. WT 3‘UTR sequences of NEAT1 or CCL2 containing the predicted miR-124-3p binding site, and corresponding MUT sequences with binding site disruption, were cloned downstream of the renilla luciferase gene. (B-C) relative luciferase activity in TCMK1 cells co-transfected with miR-124-3p mimic or mimic negative control (NC) and the indicated reporter plasmids (NEAT1-WT, NEAT1-MUT, CCL2-WT, CCL2-MUT). Data are presented as mean ± SD ( n p p p n n n n p p p n n n https://www.figdraw.com/ These results collectively confirm that DLRA validation demonstrated that miR-124-3p directly binds to the 3‘UTR regions of both NEAT1 and CCL2. This provides direct experimental evidence supporting the existence of a ceRNA regulatory axis wherein NEAT1 modulates CCL2 expression by sequestering miR-124-3p. 3.11. Basic information of included samples This study addresses the clinical need for noninvasive biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity in early-stage CKD diagnosis by investigating the diagnostic potential of serum non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Building on CKD renal tissue transcriptomic features identified in the GSE137570 Baseline analysis demonstrated no significant differences in demographic characteristics (gender, age, and body mass index (BMI)) between CKD patients and healthy controls, ensuring intergroup comparability. Comparative analysis of serum biochemical parameters showed significantly elevated BUN and Scr levels coupled with markedly reduced eGFR in CKD patients versus healthy controls. Progressive deterioration of renal function parameters was observed across CKD stages: Stage G3 patients exhibited significantly lower eGFR and higher cystatin C (Cys C) levels compared to stage G2, while stage G4 demonstrated further elevations in Scr, BUN, Cys C, and 24-hour urinary total protein (24hUTP) relative to stage G3. Results are presented in Table 5 Table 5. Comparison of clinical and biochemical parameters (mean ± SD or M[P75-P25]).

Furthermore, renal function indices in CKD patients exhibited a graded deterioration corresponding to disease stage progression. This establishes a reliable clinical sample foundation for subsequent serum biomarker analysis. 3.12. Comparative analysis of serum CCL2, miR-124-3p, and NEAT1 levels Serum levels of CCL2 (quantified via ELISA) and miR-124-3p/NEAT1 (measured by RT-qPCR) were analyzed in 20 healthy controls and 64 CKD patients. Compared to controls, CKD patients exhibited significantly elevated CCL2 levels, whereas miR-124-3p and NEAT1 showed no significant alterations. Intriguingly, progressive increases in Scr correlated with rising CCL2 levels and concurrent declines in miR-124-3p and NEAT1 expression across CKD stages ( Figure 5(D-I) Figure 5J-L) Figure 5(M-R) These results collectively demonstrate that serum levels of CCL2, miR-124-3p, and NEAT1 exhibit dynamic CKD patients. Furthermore, their expression levels are interrelated and show significant correlations with renal function impairment indices. More significantly, they demonstrate favorable diagnostic value in distinguishing different stages of CKD progression. This suggests their potential utility as noninvasive biomarkers for monitoring CKD progression in clinical practice. 4. Discussion This study identified five Hub Genes EGF, VCAN, CXCL1, MMP7, and CCL2 associated with CKD progression through bioinformatics analysis and PPI network screening. These genes are closely linked to renal function impairment and may hold significant clinical diagnostic value for renal injury, suggesting their potential for clinical translation. It is noteworthy, however, that Group 4 exhibited a significant sample size imbalance. Consequently, DEG detection relied solely on p-values. While this approach allowed the preliminary identification of 543 candidate genes, the absence of FDR correction increases the risk of false positives. These results should therefore be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. The decision to use p-values reflects a deliberate trade-off between statistical rigor and biological exploration. We emphasize that this exception does not apply to other analyses within this study, where FDR correction was consistently applied. Crucially, a key validation step strengthens our confidence in the Hub Genes: MMP7, VCAN, CXCL1, CCL2, and EGF consistently appeared in the hub screening results for Groups 1–3. This convergence indicates that these genes exhibit strong CKD associations, and the statistical methodological compromise in Group 4 did not compromise the identification of these core targets. Furthermore, through Hub Gene screening, ceRNA network prediction, and DLRA validation, we identified the NEAT1/miR-124-3p/CCL2 axis as a potential ceRNA regulatory pathway in CKD. NcRNAs represent a class of transcripts that lack protein-coding potential. Ubiquitously expressed across cell types, ncRNAs are genomically transcribed yet function directly at the RNA level without translation [ 35 36 37 38 39–41 Mounting evidence has elucidated the multidimensional regulatory mechanisms of NEAT1 in kidney diseases. NEAT1 mediates pivotal roles in renal injury pathogenesis by dynamically regulating inflammation, fibrosis, and cell death pathways. During AKI, NEAT1 activates NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome assembly through the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (Rack1)-mediated Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B (TLR4/NF-κB) signaling axis, thereby amplifying inflammatory responses. Concurrently, it promotes renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis via p53-dependent transcriptional regulation [ 42 43 44 45 43 21 miR-124-3p is a microRNA that exerts significant regulatory functions in kidney pathophysiology. It mediates critical biological processes across diverse renal pathologies including diabetic nephropathy, nephrolithiasis, AKI, lupus nephritis, and renal interstitial fibrosis [ 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 Upon renal tissue injury, the innate immune system initiates a cascade of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). These mediators accumulate within the renal interstitium, triggering fibroblast proliferation, activation, and transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. This process promotes excessive synthesis of collagen fibers and ECM components, ultimately replacing functional renal parenchyma with fibrotic scar tissue. Chemokines – secreted signaling proteins characterized by their ability to induce directional chemotaxis – are classified into four subfamilies (CXC, CC, CX3C, and XC) based on conserved cysteine residue motifs. Chemokines mediate biological functions by binding G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors (GPCRs), playing crucial roles in leukocyte migration, cellular proliferation, pathogen defense, and the pathogenesis of inflammation and cancer within tissue microenvironments [ 56 57 58 59 60 Based on the preceding evidence, we hypothesize that renal tissue injury induces elevated NEAT1 expression, which competitively binds miR-124-3p, thereby attenuating miR-124-3p-mediated suppression of CCL2. This cascade amplifies inflammatory responses and exacerbates renal functional impairment ( Figure 5(S) To reconcile this paradox, we propose the following non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: Phase-Specific Compensatory Surge: The concurrent elevation of serum NEAT1 and miR-124-3p in early-stage CKD (G2) may represent a transient adaptive response. miR-124-3p upregulation could constitute a physiological effort to mitigate initial renal injury through anti-inflammatory/fibrotic actions, while NEAT1 induction reflects a counter-regulatory stress signal. This compensatory interplay may transiently override canonical ceRNA dynamics during early pathogenesis. Multi-Layered Transcriptional Dominance: NEAT1 expression is governed by regulatory hierarchies extending beyond miRNA sponging, including: Transcription factor activation (e.g., hypoxia-inducible factors under renal hypoxia) [ 61 62 63 64 Technical and Biological Confounders: Sample heterogeneity: Variability in CKD etiology (e.g., diabetic vs. hypertensive nephropathy) may drive distinct biomarker signatures. Preanalytical factors: Differences in RNA stability in circulation, circadian rhythms, or sample processing protocols could quantitatively bias measurements. Compartmentalization: Serum levels may not faithfully mirror intrarenal molecular crosstalk due to tissue-blood barrier effects or cell-type-specific expression. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitation imposed by the restricted size of the clinical cohort in this pilot investigation. The modest sample size, particularly within early-stage CKD G2 subgroups, may compromise statistical power for detecting subtle biomarker dynamics and increase vulnerability to type II statistical errors. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design precludes evaluation of longitudinal biomarker trajectories. These limitations may thus impair the generalizability of our findings concerning the paradoxical elevation of NEAT1/miR-124-3p in CKD stage G2. To address this limitation, future large-scale, multi-center prospective studies incorporating serial sampling are warranted to validate these preliminary observations and delineate the trajectory of the NEAT1/miR-124-3p/CCL2 axis across CKD stages. While prior studies have independently implicated NEAT1, miR-124-3p, and CCL2 in RIF, the functional significance of the NEAT1/miR-124-3p/CCL2 axis in RIF remains incompletely defined. Through integrated bioinformatic prediction, DLRA, and clinical sample validation, our study establishes the critical involvement of this axis in CKD progression. These findings highlight its dual utility as both a diagnostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target. Targeted modulation of this axis – for instance, via inhibition of NEAT1 expression or function – may yield novel therapeutic strategies to attenuate CKD progression. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) technology, a validated approach for lncRNA targeting [ 65 66 5. Conclusion In summary, this study identified and validated EGF, VCAN, CXCL1, and CCL2 as novel biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic potential for CKD, while additionally highlighting the NEAT1/miR-124-3p/CCL2 axis as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target.
