Thus, we explore the amino acid metabolic profile in HCC to construct effective prognosis model and identify novel potential therapeutic target for HCC. Methods The transcriptomic data and clinical information of HCC patients were directly obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then we classified them into two subtypes based on selected amino acid metabolism-related genes (SARGs) and explored the differences between them. Besides, risk models were constructed based on SARGs through LASSO regression, and we further validated and evaluated the predictive effect of the model. Subsequently, we validated the key gene of LARS1 in the model. We analyzed the discrepancy of LARS1 in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues in both TCGA and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the results were verified in HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy from our hospital via PCR and Immunohistochemistry (IHC). Finally, we explored the biological function of LARS1 in vitro Results We classified HCC patients into Cluster A and B subtypes based on 81 SARGs. And patients in Cluster B exhibited significantly poorer prognosis, higher tumor malignancy levels, higher TIDE scores and T cell exhaustion or dysfunction. Then 15 genes were included to construct the risk model. The risk score was positively associated with poor prognosis. We further extracted LARS1 as the key gene of the model and found that high LARS1 tended to have poorer prognosis with higher expression in tumor tissues than in adjacent non-tumor ones in both TCGA and GEO. PCR and IHC were conducted for verification. Suppression of LARS1 markedly inhibited the growth of HCC cells. Additionally, LARS1 knockdown significantly impeded cellular migration and invasion in vitro Conclusion We have successfully developed a prognostic model based on 15 genes associated with amino acid metabolism. We also verified that knockdown of LARS1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC in vitro LARS1 HCC amino acid metabolism prognosis model autophagy The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Globally, there is an estimated of 840,000 new cases and over 780,000 deaths each year ( 1 2 3 Metabolic reprogramming, a hallmark of cancer, is a key process by which tumor cells support their rapid proliferation and evade immune surveillance ( 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (LARS1) gene encodes a cystosolic leucine-tRNA synthetase, a member of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs). The ARS family are evolutionary conserved enzymes and catalyze the ligation of tRNAs with their cognate amino acids for translation in protein synthesis, playing a pivotal roles in translation of RNA into proteins ( 11 12 13 14 15 16 As a result, this study focuses on exploring the amino acid metabolic profile and elucidating the oncogenic roles of LARS1 in amino acid metabolism of HCC. The ultimate goal is to identify novel prognostic biomarkers and uncover potential therapeutic targets to improve patient prognosis and treatment responsiveness in HCC. Materials and methods Data acquisition and procession The transcriptomic data and clinical information for TCGA-LIHC were directly obtained from the GDC portal ( https://gdc.cancer.gov/ https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/  Supplementary Table S1  Supplementary Table S2 Consensus clustering Initially, we performed consensus clustering analysis using ConsensusClusterPlus R package to cluster HCC patients into distinct molecular subtypes based on the expression of SARGs. We calculated the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for each cluster number K using the consensus matrix to determine the optimal number of clusters. Heterogeneity between different molecular groups was described by principal components analysis (PCA). And Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves were used to assess the survival between different subtypes based on survival and survminer R package. Differential enrichment analysis of SARG subtypes We identified differential expression genes (DEGs) between the molecular subtypes by edgeR package, with the criteria of | log2FC|≥1 and FDR<0.05. To explore the differences in biological functions between different cluster groups, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the clusterProfler R package. To further explore the possible critical pathways in tumor progression across subtypes, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) of Hallmark pathways was performed. Besides,the difference in tumor mutation burden (TMB) level was visualized via maftools R package between different SARG subtypes. Tumor microenvironment and drug sensitivity analysis of SARG subtypes The single gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was employed to investigate immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment (TME) in HCC patients of SARGs-related subtypes ( 17 http://tide.dfci.harvard.edu/ 18 https://www.cancerrxgene.org/ Construction of the prognostic model based on SARGs We established the prognostic risk model for HCC patients based on SARGs by LASSO regression. The risk score formula were established as follows: Risk score=∑(expi*coefi), where expi represents gene expressions and coefi represents regression coefficients. Then patients were categorized into high- and low-risk group according to the median risk score. And we drew heatmap to visualize the expression levels of model genes in high- and low-risk group. Validation and evaluation of prognostic risk model Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to verify the accuracy of the risk model. Overall survival (OS) were evaluated by K-M survival analysis based on ‘survminer’ and ‘survival’ R package to evaluate the ability to discriminate between patients of different risk levels. And Wilcoxon tests were conducted to evaluate the differences of risk score between alive and dead HCC cohorts. To further confirm the model’s independent prognostic ability, both univariate and multivariate Cox regression were performed after evaluation of proportional hazards assumption by Schoenfeld residuals test. A nomogram combining the model with clinicopathological features was used to calculate the predicted survival time of HCC patients, and the accuracy was measured via the calibration plot. We also drew Sankey diagram to evalute the relationship among molecular subtypes, risk groups and survival status. Then DEGs between high-risk and low-risk groups were identified based on edgeR package using |log2FC|>1 and FDR<0.05 as criteria. And GO and KEGG were utilized to explore the biological functions of DEGs between high- and low-risk group. Additionally, drug sensitivity was assessed based on GDSC database using oncoPredict R package between the two risk groups. To further extracted the key gene of the risk model, we evaluated the expression levels between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues and gene-related prognosis of all model genes. Functional analysis related to LARS1 levels The discrepancy of LARS1 in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues were verified in datasets of GSE112790 GSE39791 GSE45267 GSE69715 GSE76427 Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis Single-cell RNA sequencing data of HCC were obtained in dataset of GSE149614 Excluding cells with fewer than 500 or more than 30,000 of total Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts. Excluding cells fewer than 200 or more than 8,000 detected genes. Excluding cells with >10% mitochondrial gene expression. Gene expression data were normalized according to the Log Normalization algorithm. Batch effect correction among different HCC samples was performed using Harmony. PCA was performed to determine significant and influential dimensions. And the top 10 principal components were clustered via the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions with a resolution of 0.3. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used for visualization. Cell type annotation was performed based on the expression of well-established marker genes. Specifically, hepatoma cells were identified by AFP, EPCAM, ALB and GPC3; T cells by CD3D, CD3E and TRAC; NK cells by NKG7, GNLY and KLRD1; neutrophils by S100A8, S100A9 and FCGR3B; macrophages by CD68, CD14 and CD163; fibroblasts by COL1A1, FAP and THY1; B cells by CD19, CD79A and MS4A1; and endothelial cells by PECAM1, VWF and CDH5. These marker genes were curated from CellMarker ( 19 RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was isolated from fresh cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues of 3 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy in Cangzhou People’s Hospital, using an RNA extraction kit (Sparkjade, China). The Ethics Committee of Cangzhou People’s Hospital approved the acquisition of tissue samples and clinical data (Approval No: AF/SC-08/02.0). cDNA was synthesized from the isolated RNA by reverse transcription according to the instructions of the qRT-PCR kit (Takara, Japan). The amplification reactions were carried out using designed primers according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Vazyme). The primer sequences were as follows: LARS1 (5’TTTGCTGTAGGGTACCAGCG3’, 5’CGACGCCAGTCTACCTTCAA3’),β actin (5’TCATCACCATTGGCAATGAG3’, 5’CACTGTGTTGGCGTACAGGT3’). Immunohistochemistry The paraffin-embedded tissue sections were obtained from HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy in Cangzhou People’s Hospital from 2023-2024. The specimens were subjected to high-temperature (70°C) baking for 2 hours, followed by dewaxing with xylene and graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer solution, and endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. The tissue sections were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of anti-LARS1 antibody (Proteintech, 21146-1-AP, China) to detect the expression of LARS1. The assessment of LARS1 expression levels was performed by two pathologists in a blinded manner. Tumor samples were divided into high and low LARS1 expression groups based on the median expression levels. Cell culture and lentiviral transfection Hep3B, MHCC97H, PLC/PRF/5 (PLC), SK-hep-1, and Hep G2 liver cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% streptomycin-penicillin, and maintained in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 5 Western blot The cells were lysed using 1× SDS lysis buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium vanadate, and a 1×protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Switzerland) at 4°C for 30 minutes. The collected proteins were denatured in a 95°C water bath for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 13,000×g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Equal amounts of the protein supernatant were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for separation via SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck, Germany) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The membrane was subsequently incubated with primary and secondary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: anti-LARS1 (1:1000) from Proteintech, anti-ATG5 (1:1000) from Cell Signaling Technology, anti-Beclin1 (1:1000) from Cell Signaling Technology, anti-SQSTM1/p62 (1:1000) from Cell Signaling Technology and anti-β-actin (1:1000) from Abcam. CCK8 assay Cells were cultured in a 96-well plate at a density of 1000 cells per well, with 100 μl of cell culture medium and 10 ul CCK8 reagent (Biosharp, China) added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Biotek, USA). Six parallel wells were set up for each group, and the average value was calculated. The cell proliferation curve was drawn by continuous detection for3-4 days. Edu assay Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 1×10 5 2 Invasion and migration assays Cell migration and invasion assays were evaluated using Transwell chambers (Neuro Probe, USA). Cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and cultured to 70% confluence. The cell suspension was prepared at a concentration of 1×10 6 2 Statistical analysis All experimental measurements were were detected in triplicate. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.0 and R (R-4.3.0). For two group comparison, the Student’s t-test was conducted for normally distributed continuous data and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for others. For multiple group comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for normally distributed continuous data and the Kruskal-Wallis test for others. Chi-square test was used to compare the differences for categorical variables. LSD post-hoc P P P P P Results Identification of amino acid metabolism-related genes and subtypes A total of 366 ARGs were obtained from MsigDB website and 81 SARGs were selected after intersecting ARGs, DEGs between HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues and prognostic genes by Cox regression in 369 HCC patients from TCGA.

We found that CD56bright natural killer cells, CD56dim natural killer cells, central memory CD8 T cells, gamma delta T cells, immature B cells, memory B cells, natural killer cells, and neutrophils were more abundant in Cluster A (  Figure 2A  Figures 2B, C 20  Figures 2D–G Figure 2  (A) (B) (C) (D–G) (H) p p p p Grouped images show statistical comparisons between Cluster A and Cluster B.

Construction of a prognostic model for HCC based on SARGs The 81 SARGs were used to construct the risk model.

The high expression of LARS1 is associated with poor prognosis in HCC To further explore the role of LARS1 in HCC, we investigated the prognosis of high- and low-LARS1, including OS, PFS and DSS based on TCGA. Results indicated that high LARS1 expression was associated with poorer prognosis of HCC patients (  Figures 5A–C  Figure 5D  Figures 5E, F 16 P P  Figures 5G–J  Supplementary Figure S2A  Supplementary Figure S2B Figure 5  (A–C) (D) (E) (F) (G–J) p p p p Figures A-C display various data on LARS1 expression in normal versus tumor tissues, including survival curves (OS, PFS, DSS), D shows LARS1 expression levels across different databases, E bar graphs shows mRNA levels of LARS1 between cancerous and adjacent non-tumor tissues based on PCR.

Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of LARS1associated with amino acid metabolism in HCC To further elucidate the potential role of LARS1 in HCC and its association with amino acid metabolism, we performed a comprehensive analysis based on single-cell RNA sequencing data. Specifically, we analyzed scRNA-seq data from multiple HCC samples in the GSE149614  Figures 6A, B  Figure 6C  Figure 6D  Figure 6E  Figure 6F  Figure 6G  Figure 6H Figure 6  (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) (H) (I) A shows quality control metrics of the scRNA-seq data, including gene count, gene feature and mitochondrial gene percentage.

Functional enrichment analysis of these DEGs revealed significant enrichment in pathways such as biosynthesis of amino acids, carbon metabolism, and cysteine and methionine metabolism, suggesting a potential role of LARS1 in regulating amino acid metabolic reprogramming in HCC (  Figure 6I Knockdown of LARS1 inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells Then, we explored the biological functions of LARS1 in the proliferation and metastasis of HCC. We initially assessed LARS1 expression levels in different HCC cell lines, including Hep3B, MHCC97-H, PLC, SK-Hep-1 and HepG2, and found that LARS1 expression was higher in the SK-Hep-1 cell line. As a result, we used SK-Hep-1 cells to establish stable LARS1 knockdown cell lines, and the efficiency of LARS1 deletion was validated by WB.

Discussion Cancer cells often encounter hypoxic and hypo-nutrient conditions for the huge consumption of metabolites ( 24 25 26 27 As the largest gland in human body, liver plays a critical role in metabolism. And the metabolism process of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, hormones, bile, and exogenous diet in liver influence the development of various diseases vice versa. Expect for glucose metabolism, the alterations also contain increased fatty acid synthesis, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide production and so on ( 28 6 29 30 31 32 In the present study, we analyzed the molecular patterns and clinical significance of amino acid metabolism in HCC. Patients with SARG cluster B showed poorer prognosis and higher activity of pathways associated with malignancy progression, including G2M_CHECKPOINT, E2F_TARGETS, MYC_TARGETS_V2. Besides, the rate of mutation in TP53 in Cluster B was greatest and significantly higher compared with Cluster A. As we know, TP53 mutation contributes to carcinogenesis and tumor development, suggesting enhanced proliferative and invasive potential of Cluster B. In addition, immune cell infiltration also differed significantly between the two subtypes. Higher levels of infiltration of anti-tumor effector cells and lower TIDE scores were found in the Cluster A, indicating that patients in the Cluster A might be more sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Cluster B exhibited higher levels of Progenitor Exhaustion, Quiescence, Senescence, and Terminal Exhaustion according to the evaluation of functional status of T cells, indicating immunosuppressive subtype in Cluster B, which was corroborated by subsequent analysis of immunosuppressive regulators. Consequently, the classification based on amino acid metabolism revealed heterogeneity and immune microenvironment of HCC, which were anticipated to provide potential evidence for precision treatment. Additionally, we screened 15 genes for the construction of the risk models by LASSO regression based on metabolism-related genes. There were significant differences in prognosis between the high- and low-risk groups. And ROC curves confirmed robust predictive performance of the risk model in distinguishing high- and low-risk HCC patients. The model genes were involved in multiple biological processes pertaining to HCC development. For instance, TXNRD1 and NQO1, as redox stress-related enzymes, have been reported to be upregulated in various cancers and promote malignant progression ( 33 35 36 In addition, we also found that patients in the low-risk group were more sensitive to drugs such as AZD2014. AZD2014 is a dual inhibitor of mTORC1 and C2. It is demonstrated that AZD2014 resulted in more profound proliferation suppression, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and autophagy in HCC cells compared with rapamycin ( 37 38 39 To deeply understand the mechanisms behind amino acid metabolism in HCC, further investigation of key genes in the model is needed. Among the 15-gene risk models, LARS1 has the highest risk coefficient and is most likely the key gene in the model. Previous study has suggested that LARS1 was an important oncogene in HCC and was associated with immune infiltration, consistent with our findings ( 16 Amino acid imbalance is observed in chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and related disease states, characterized by a reduction in BCAAs (including valine, leucine and isoleucine) and an elevation in aromatic amino acids (AAAs) in serum ( 40 in vitro in vivo 10 41 42 43 44 42 in vivo 45 This study has several limitations. Firstly, the risk model based on 15 genes was validated solely using an TCGA datasets via retrospective analyses. Thus, external validation in future studies are needed to further validate the risk model. Secondly, the role of LARS1 in amino acid metabolism of HCC warrants systematic experimental verification. Additionally, direct experimental evidence for LARS1 regulating mTORC1 downstream proteins, such as p-S6K/p-4EBP1, is currently lacking in our study, the molecular mechanism of LARS1 in regulating mTORC1 and autophagy needs to be further studied both in vivo in vitro In conclusion, we have successfully developed a prognostic model based on 15 genes associated with amino acid metabolism and identified LARS1 as the key gene. Moreover, we revealed the heterogeneous expression of LARS1 in HCC and its potential tumor-promoting mechanisms by single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Finally, we verified that knockdown of LARS1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC in vitro Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
