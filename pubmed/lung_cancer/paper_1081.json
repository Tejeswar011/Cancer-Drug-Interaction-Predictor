PANoptosis is a unique lytic, innate immune, and inflammatory cell death pathway, initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes. In diseases like cerebral ischemia, retinal ischemia, myocardial ischemia, renal ischemia, and spinal cord ischemia, targeting key regulatory factors of PANoptosis can help mitigate tissue damage. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of PANoptosis in ischemic diseases—from molecular mechanisms to clinical applications—merits further investigation. However, effectively regulating PANoptosis to achieve therapeutic outcomes remains a critical scientific challenge that must be addressed. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of PANoptosis in ischemic diseases and its potential therapeutic implications, aiming to provide new insights and a theoretical foundation for precision treatment in these conditions.

Dysregulation of PCD is closely associated with the onset and progression of various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and infectious diseases [ 1 2 In the context of ischemic diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, the mechanisms underlying cell death are intricately linked to processes like tissue ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI), the formation of inflammatory microenvironments, and vascular remodeling. Traditional research has often focused on the roles of individual PCD pathways, such as apoptosis-mediated neuronal loss or pyroptosis-induced inflammatory cascades. However, these isolated perspectives often fail to capture the full complexity of the disease. The concept of PANoptosis offers a new direction for the study of ischemic diseases. Its PANoptosome can be activated by upstream sensors such as Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1), NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 (NLRP12), NLR family caspase recruitment domain containing 5 (NLRC5), and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) [ 3 5 In-depth study of the role of PANoptosis in ischemic diseases not only enhances our understanding of the pathological processes involved in ischemic diseases but may also reveal new targets and strategies for treatment. Current treatment options for ischemic diseases include traditional pharmacological therapies, surgical interventions, and interventional procedures. However, these approaches still have certain limitations regarding efficacy and safety. Therefore, exploring the therapeutic potential of PANoptosis in ischemic diseases presents promising opportunities to overcome this medical challenge. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the relationship between ischemic diseases and PCD, particularly PANoptosis, to establish a theoretical basis for future research and clinical applications. Ischemic diseases and programmed cell death PCD is an intrinsic cell-autonomous process of cellular demise, precisely encoded by genes within a highly conserved molecular regulatory network. This process initiates a cascade of molecular events by activating endogenous signaling pathways (such as the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and the death receptor pathway) or exogenous stress responses (such as endoplasmic reticulum stress and DNA damage response), ultimately leading to the programmed disassembly of cellular structures [ 6 7 2 1 8 Fig. 1 Mechanisms of programmed cell death in ischemic diseases. Overview of the cellular changes and destructive mechanisms that occur during the ischemic and reperfusion phases of ischemic diseases. It also provides an in-depth discussion of three forms of programmed cell death: pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Apoptosis is a mechanism centered on caspases, which can be triggered by both extrinsic and intrinsic mitochondrial pathways. Pyroptosis is triggered through both classical and non-classical pathways, leading to the formation of NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 and GSDMD-N, resulting in cell membrane perforation and the release of cellular contents. Necroptosis is primarily induced by external stimuli, and its regulation depends on the interaction between MLKL, RIPK3, and RIPK1, leading to the formation of necrosomes for regulation. If ischemia is alleviated through treatment, secondary damage may arise during the subsequent reperfusion phase due to the excessive release of free radicals, calcium overload, heightened activation of the inflammatory responses, and activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). During mitochondrial ischemia and hypoxia, oxidative phosphorylation is impaired, and upon reperfusion, the electron transport chain is not fully restored, leading to electron leakage and the production of superoxide anion radicals [ 9 10 11 2 12 2 13 14 13 During excessive inflammatory activation, ischemia–reperfusion triggers the immune response, resulting in the aggregation and activation of immune cells, complement system activation, and onset of sterile inflammation. As a large number of cell adhesion molecules, chemokines, and cytokines are produced, leukocytes migrate to the ischemic tissue. This migration activates pathogen recognition receptors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family signaling pathways, resulting in excessive inflammatory activation [ 15 16 17 The damaging role of iNOS activation in IRI is primarily mediated by pathological accumulation of NO and its derivatives, which are produced by iNOS. During the later phase of reperfusion, inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, significantly express iNOS through the NF-κB/STAT1 pathway. This leads to the production of NO, which rapidly reacts with concurrently released superoxide anions (O₂⁻) to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻). ONOO⁻ contributes to mitochondrial toxicity, DNA damage, impairment of protein function, and the amplification of inflammatory cascades [ 18 Furthermore, iNOS-derived NO can directly inhibit electron transport chain complex IV, exacerbating the mitochondrial energy crisis during reperfusion. The imbalance between NO and O₂⁻ induces “nitrosative stress,” which synergizes with oxidative stress and calcium overload [ 19 Welt et al. [ 20 21 22 Ischemic diseases and pyroptosis Pyroptosis, first proposed by Cookson and Brennan in 1999 [ 23 24 25 26 In the MIRI model, the NLRP3 inflammasome-caspase-1/GSDMD canonical pathway has been established as a key pathway for myocardial cell pyroptosis. Hypoxia activates NLRP3 through the release of mitochondrial ROS, promoting the formation of the ASC/pro-caspase-1 complex. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves GSDMD to generate GSDMD-N, which forms pores in the myocardial cell membrane, leading to ATP depletion and lactate dehydrogenase release [ 27 28 28 29 Ischemic diseases and apoptosis Apoptosis, first proposed by Kerr et al. [ 30 31 In response to apoptotic stimuli, Bax and Bak undergo conformational changes and translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane, resulting in increased mitochondrial membrane permeability, loss of membrane potential, and the release of apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO [ 32 33 34 35 In the study of the pathological mechanisms underlying ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, the regulation of neuronal PCD plays a crucial role. Research using focal cerebral ischemia models, such as the Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) model, has confirmed that the activation of dual apoptotic pathways in the penumbra is a key pathological cause of deterioration of neurological function [ 36 37 Ischemic diseases and necroptosis Necroptosis was first discovered in 2005 and is a form of programmed inflammatory cell death [ 38 39 40 In chronic ischemic myopathy induced by peripheral artery disease, histological analysis reveals a significant enhancement of RIPK3-mediated skeletal muscle necroptosis. Its activation level is significantly negatively correlated with the regenerative potential of muscle satellite cells [ 41 42 43 Ischemic diseases and PANoptosis PANoptosis is a unique lytic, innate immune, and inflammatory cell death pathway, initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes [ 4 44 Yan et al. [ 44 Research conducted by LiPB et al. has indicated that Piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (Piezo1), acting as a cardiac mechanosensor, drives the progression of cardiac IRI through caspase-8-mediated cardiomyocyte PANoptosis. As a mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1 specifically interacts with caspase-8, a key initiating activator of the PANoptosome, thereby activating the cardiomyocyte PANoptosis signaling pathway, ultimately leading to cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, the study observed that in cardiac tissue subjected to IRI, the mRNA and protein expression levels of the PANoptosome significantly increased with prolonged reperfusion time [ 45 PANoptosis and PANoptosome PANoptosis is an innovative concept in cell death research, emerging from a detailed exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying PCD. Initial studies on cell death primarily focused on apoptosis, but the identification of PANoptosis marked an expansion in scientists’ understanding of cell death mechanisms. In 2019, Malireddi et al. [ 2 39 PANoptosis is regulated by upstream receptors and molecular cascade signals, which assemble into a polymeric complex, termed the PANoptosome. During the signal transduction process, the PANoptosome occupies a pinitol position, receiving and integrating various signals, thus initiating a series of molecular events that affect cell fate. PANoptosomes are multiprotein complexes that form in response to innate immune sensor activation and can contain multiple caspases as well as RIPK1 and RIPK3. These complexes induce the activation of gasdermins and MLKL, leading to membrane pore formation and the release of DAMPs (such as HMGB1), cytokines, and chemokines [ 46 47 2 48 Fig. 2 Discovery timeline of PANoptosomes in PANoptosis. Discovery timeline of the four major PANoptosomes in the field of PANoptosis, along with their unique molecular structures. In terms of functional mechanisms, these PANoptosomes participate in and regulate the initiation and execution of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. ZBP1-PANoptosome ZBP1, also known as the DNA-dependent activator of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors, functions as an innate nucleic acid sensor and immune receptor, playing a role in specific regions of the genome [ 49 50 51 The ZBP1-PANoptosome is consists of ZBP1, ASC, NLRP3, RIPK3, caspase-1, caspase-8, and caspase-6 [ 52 53 54 55 AIM2-PANoptosome AIM2 is a member of the PYHIN protein family and is a classic cytoplasmic innate immune receptor, containing an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and a C-terminal HIN-200 domain. As a member of the death domain superfamily, PYD mediates protein–protein interactions and playing a vital role in inflammasome assembly and signal transduction. The HIN-200 domain contains two tandem oligodeoxynucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding folding domains (OB-folds), which specifically recognize double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and are essential elements for AIM2’s functions as a DNA sensor [ 56 57 F. novicida 58 Lee et al. [ 59 Francisella novicida Mefv–/– Zbp1–/– Aim2–/– Mefv–/–Zbp1–/– RIPK1-PANoptosome RIPK1 belongs to the RIP serine/threonine kinase family, characterized by an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal death domain [ 60 61 55 NLRP12-PANoptosome NLRP12, as an important member of the NLR family, features a modular structure that includes an N-terminal pyrin domain, a central nucleotide-binding domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat that contribute to its role in regulating inflammatory responses and immune signaling. The N-terminus plays a crucial role in protein–protein interactions and signal initiation. The central region contains the NACHT domain, which is essential for sensing intracellular danger signals, carrying out nucleotide exchange, and activating oligomerization. The C-terminus consists of a leucine-rich repeat sequence and is primarily responsible for recognizing PAMPs and endogenous danger signals, as it initiates downstream immune responses [ 62 63 64 65 64 NLRC5-PANoptosome NLRC5 is a highly expressed and enigmatic member of the NLR family, particularly in hematopoietic cells [ 66 4 Nlrp12 − − , Pycard − − , and Nlrc5 − − NLRP3-PANoptosome NLRP3, one of the most extensively studied inflammasome sensors, can recognize a variety of infectious and non-infectious stimuli, thereby inducing inflammatory cell death, pyroptosis, and the activation and release of inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 [ 67 5 The relationship between PANoptosis and ischemic diseases Cerebral ischemic diseases Ischemic stroke is a complex and heterogeneous condition caused by transient or permanent narrowing or occlusion of the brain’s supply arteries, leading to cerebral infarction. The final infarction area is influenced by multiple factors, including ischemic duration, severity, infarct location, and age [ 68 69 70 71 72 73 1 Table 1 Ischemic diseases Ischemic diseases Core pathological mechanisms Key molecular pathways Forms of cell death Clinical features Treatment strategies References Cerebral ischemic diseases Local blood flow interruption → Neuronal ATP depletion → Calcium overload and excitotoxicity NMDA receptor overactivation ROS burst mPTP opening Pyroptosis Apoptosis Necroptosis Transient ischemic attack (TIA) Cerebral infarction Thrombolysis (rt-PA) Endovascular thrombectomy Neuroprotective agents (edaravone) [ 74 75 Retinal ischemic diseases Central retinal artery/vein occlusion → Hypoxia of photoreceptor cells VEGF upregulation HIF-1α-mediated hypoxic adaptation Pyroptosis Apoptosis Necroptosis Autophagy Central retinal artery occlusion Branch retinal artery occlusion Retinal vein occlusion Lowering intraocular pressure Anti-VEGF treatment hyperbaric oxygen therapy [ 76 77 Myocardial ischemic diseases Coronary artery occlusion → Myocardial ATP depletion → Contractile dysfunction Troponin release mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling Pyroptosis Apoptosis Necroptosis Ferroptosis Angina pectoris Myocardial infarction PCI/coronary artery bypass grafting Beta-blockers Antiplatelet therapy [ 78 Renal ischemic diseases Renal artery stenosis/embolism → Ischemic injury of renal tubular epithelial cells Elevated KIM-1 expression TGF-β-mediated fibrosis Pyroptosis Apoptosis Necroptosis Renal artery stenosis Renal infarction ACE inhibitors/ARBs to delay fibrosis Adjuvant supportive therapy Renal replacement therapy [ 79 80 Spinal cord ischemic diseases Insufficient spinal artery blood supply → Necrosis of neurons and glial cells Glutamate excitotoxicity NOS activity dysregulation Pyroptosis Apoptosis Necroptosis Acute spinal cord ischemia Chronic ischemia due to spinal vascular malformations Methylprednisolone pulse therapy CSF drainage Neurotrophic factors [ 81 ARBs, Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers; ATP, Adenosine Triphosphate; CABG, Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting; CSF, Cerebrospinal Fluid; HIF-1α, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha; KIM-1, Kidney Injury Molecule-1; mPTP, Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore; NOS, Nitric Oxide Synthase; NMDA, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; PCI, Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species; TGF-β, Transforming Growth Factor Beta; TIA, Transient Ischemic Attack; VEGF, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Retinal ischemic diseases Retinal ischemia is caused by alterations in ocular hemodynamics, leading to persistent insufficient retinal perfusion. Common causes include age-related macular degeneration, central retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. Ischemia causes a deficiency in retinal nutrients and oxygen supply, triggering intracellular stress responses such as enhanced glutamatergic stimulation and increased oxidative stress, which result in severe neuronal damage and functional decline of the retina. Although prompt reperfusion can mitigate some damage (Table 1 76 Glaucoma, a typical neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by progressive optic nerve atrophy and visual field loss, making it the leading irreversible cause of blindness worldwide. Epidemiological studies estimate that, due to the aging global population and lifestyle changes, the number of glaucoma patients worldwide may reach approximately 111.8 million by 2040 [ 82 Li et al. [ 83 Myocardial ischemic diseases Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, presenting a significant public health challenge, with coronary artery ischemia being a primary contributor to MI [ 84 85 43 1 In their study on the impact of the Piezo1 mechanosensitive ion channel on MIRI, Li et al. [ 45 Zuurbier et al. [ 86 Wu et al. [ 87 Renal ischemic diseases Renal IRI occurs when blood flow is restored to the kidneys after a brief ischemic episode, triggering a cascade of complex pathophysiological changes. This condition is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and plays a key role in the progression of acute renal dysfunction and kidney disease [ 88 1 89 Uysal et al. [ 90 Spinal cord ischemic diseases Spinal cord IRI (SCIRI) commonly occurs following spinal decompression surgery for the relief of spinal cord compression from conditions such as spinal intradural lesions (e.g., disc herniation, spinal tumors, spinal tuberculosis); intrathecal lesions (e.g., intrathecal tumors, epidural abscesses, vertebral fractures, etc.); as well as during thoracoabdominal aorta clamping and release during surgery. The incidence of SCIRI ranges from 2 to 40%, with significant variation based on disease type, surgical technique, and individual patient factors [ 91 1 69 92 Xie et al. [ 93 3 Fig. 3 Classification of Ischemic Diseases Across Organs. The various types of ischemic diseases in different organs, including the brain, retina, myocardium, kidneys, and spinal cord, with a focus on disease classification and corresponding clinical symptoms. Treatment of PANoptosis and ischemic diseases Ischemic diseases encompass a range of conditions with widespread effects and serious adverse impacts on the body, triggering complex pathophysiological cascades across multiple organ systems. With advancements in medical research and continuous innovations in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, treatment strategies targeting PANoptosis in ischemic diseases have become increasingly diversified. Traditional drug therapies, modern surgical interventions, and interventional treatments remain important approaches [ 94 96 97 98 99 101 102 104 Traditional drug treatment for ischemic diseases Antiplatelet drugs play a critical role in the treatment of ischemic diseases. They primarily reduce the risk of thrombosis by inhibiting platelet aggregation, thereby improving blood supply to ischemic tissues [ 94 105 106 107 Heparin is a classic and widely used anticoagulant that enhances the activity of antithrombin III, inhibits the generation of prothrombinase, interferes with thrombin activity, and suppresses thrombus formation [ 108 109 Statins, which are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are valuable in the prevention and treatment of ischemic diseases by inhibiting generalized apoptosis. Their potent lipid-lowering effects can stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and reduce the risk of plaque rupture, a key mechanism in the development of ACS and other cardiovascular diseases. Statins also regulate the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), promote nitric oxide (NO) production, dilate blood vessels, and improve microcirculation. In addition, statins have multifaceted vascular protective effects: They possess antioxidant properties, scavenge free radicals, and alleviate oxidative stress-induced damage to the vascular wall; they exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators and slowing vascular inflammation; they modulate the immune system to reduce immune hyperactivity-induced vascular damage; they maintain the normal function and quantity of progenitor cells, promoting vascular repair and regeneration [ 110 Surgical and interventional treatment of ischemic diseases Surgical vascular reconstruction improves blood supply to ischemic tissues through direct surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), which is commonly performed for severe coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. Studies have shown that patients undergoing CABG experience a reduction in infarct size and a decrease in myocardial cell apoptosis markers. This improvement is attributed to the restoration of blood flow during surgery, which reduces ROS production, inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathways, and consequently decreases myocardial cell apoptosis, thereby alleviating the impact of generalized apoptosis [ 95 Intravenous thrombolysis involves the precise delivery thrombolytic agents to the site of a thrombus via a catheter. For instance, in cases of acute cerebral infarction, intra-arterial administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is commonly used for thrombolysis. This therapy can rapidly dissolve the thrombus, reopen the occluded cerebral vessels, restore cerebral blood flow, and prevent irreversible neuronal injury. Timely restoration of blood flow can reduce the release of inflammatory mediators, mitigate inflammation-induced neuronal damage, and decrease the level of generalized apoptosis [ 96 Mechanical thrombectomy can rapidly remove intracranial large vessel thrombi and restore blood flow perfusion. Among these, endovascular thrombectomy is one of the key therapeutic methods for treating ischemic diseases, and it plays a crucial role in the management of acute large vessel occlusive ischemic stroke [ 111 112 Targeted therapy of ischemic diseases Z-VAD-FMK is a cell-permeable, irreversible broad-spectrum inhibitor of cysteine proteases, playing a crucial role in regulating of PCD. Hui Zhu et al. [ 97 113 Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) is a specific inhibitor of the necroptosis pathway, capable of blocking the phosphorylation of RIPK1 and preventing cells from entering the necroptosis program [ 114 115 45 116 Gene therapy of ischemic diseases Gene editing is an emerging therapeutic approach that utilizes specific technologies to modify the genetic sequences of organisms, enabling efficient and precise insertion, deletion, or replacement of genes, thereby altering genetic information and phenotype. Technologies such as Zinc Finger Nucleases, Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, and Base Editing provide powerful tools for gene function research, driving their development. These advancements also open new therapeutic avenues and strategies in biomedical science, with immense potential to address complex diseases and revolutionize traditional medical models [ 98 In ischemic diseases, the regulation of PANoptosis-related genes can alleviate cell damage and death caused by ischemia. By regulating apoptosis-related genes, such as p53, Bcl-2 family proteins, caspases, and other apoptosis-regulating molecules, gene therapy can selectively inhibit or activate specific apoptotic pathways, thereby precisely controlling cell fate. For example, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL can inhibit endogenous apoptotic pathways, reducing cell death following ischemia; activation of cell death-inducing genes (such as FasL and TNF-α) can enhance cell tolerance to ischemic injury [ 117 Lebek et al. [ 118 2 Treatment of ischemic diseases with traditional chinese herbal medicine Astragalus, first documented in Shennong’s Materia Medica 99 119 102 Danshen ( Salvia miltiorrhiza Shennong Bencao Jing The Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica 100 120 103 Ginseng, a perennial herb from the Araliaceae family, is found in China, Korea, Japan, and other regions. With a history of over two thousand years of use, it has a sweet and slightly bitter taste and a mildly warm nature. It is associated with the Lung, Spleen, and Heart meridians and is renowned for its ability to greatly replenish vital energy, earning the title “King of Herbs” [ 121 122 122 123 101 104 4 Fig. 4 Therapeutic Strategies Targeting PANoptosis in Ischemic Diseases . Discussion and prospect PANoptosis, as an emerging mechanism of cell death, has attracted considerable attention in the field of life sciences in recent years. Current research is gradually elucidating the complex roles that PANoptosis plays in various diseases. This form of cell death exhibits dual characteristics—both beneficial and detrimental—in the progression of various diseases. For example, in tumors [ 124 In the realm of ischemic diseases, research on PANoptosis is still in its infancy, with relatively few studies conducted. This may be attributed to limitations in detection technologies, the complexity of disease models, and a lack of understanding of the PANoptosis pathway. The specific and intricate regulatory mechanisms of the PANoptosis pathway. The specific and intricate regulatory mechanisms of PANoptosis require further exploration and detailed investigation. For example, the interaction network between core PANoptosis proteins has not yet been fully elucidated. Understanding how these proteins collaborate to regulate cell death signaling pathways necessitates deeper analysis. Additionally, defining the activation threshold of PANoptosis across various cell types and within the structural framework of tissue microenvironments presents a significant challenge in current scientific research. Based on existing research findings and literature, and considering future development trends, research on PANoptosis is expected to expand its applications through emerging cutting-edge technologies. Identifying effective therapeutic targets for disease treatment requires a comprehensive and multidimensional evaluation of various factors. On one hand, it is essential to explore the key hub proteins in the PANoptosis and to regulate them precisely using targeted intervention strategies, thereby achieving accurate control of the PANoptosis process. For example, the innovative development of small molecule inhibitors targeting specific key enzymes or receptors could be explored. On the other hand, it is important to closely monitor the effects of intracellular environmental factors on PANoptosis. A deeper analysis of the intrinsic mechanisms linking oxidative stress, metabolic disorders, and PANoptosis may provide novel insights and pathways for discovering new therapeutic targets. Network pharmacology can construct a multi-dimensional drug-target-disease network system, utilizing high-throughput screening methods to explore potential PANoptosis-regulating drugs. Additionally, it can predict the synergistic effects of drug combinations, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the practice of precision medicine [ 125 126 Spatial transcriptomics sequencing technology allows for the precise analysis of the spatial distribution patterns of PANoptosis-related gene expression at the tissue level in situ, revealing the spatially specific modes of PANoptosis regulation exhibited by different cell types within the tissue microenvironment. This technology provides crucial insights into the tissue-specific mechanisms of PANoptosis in both physiological and pathological states, significantly advancing the innovation and optimization of PANoptosis-related therapeutic strategies based on tissue spatial dimensions [ 127 3 As these technologies continue to advance and expand within the field of PANoptosis research, they are expected to further clarify the underlying mechanisms of PANoptosis. Additionally, they will pave the way for new breakthroughs and provide strategic guidance for innovative therapeutic strategies for various diseases, thereby offering robust support and a solid foundation for the advancement of medical science in related fields. Ischemic diseases represent a major category of diseases that pose serious threats to human health, presenting major challenges to global public health due to their high incidence, high disability rates, and high mortality rates. While progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic diseases, numerous critical challenges in clinical practice remain to be addressed. PANoptosis, a recently identified form of PCD, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ischemic diseases. However, research on PANoptosis in ischemic diseases is still in its early stages, and the academic community lacks a comprehensive understanding of the precise regulatory mechanisms involved in the occurrence and progression of the disease. A thorough analysis of the molecular mechanisms of PANoptosis in ischemic diseases not only enhances our understanding of the pathophysiological nature of these diseases, but also holds great potential for establishing a solid theoretical foundation for developing innovative therapeutic strategies. This could significantly improve clinical outcomes in the treatment of ischemic diseases and effectively enhance patient prognosis. In light of this, future research should focus on the precise regulatory mechanisms of PANoptosis in ischemic diseases, integrating cutting-edge techniques from modern molecular biology and bioinformatics analysis. This effort should aim to identify more efficient and safer therapeutic targets and intervention strategies. Meanwhile, deep interdisciplinary collaboration and the organic integration of technologies will become the driving force behind the continuous and in-depth development of PANoptosis research, guiding the field toward a more precise and comprehensive understanding and offering new therapeutic hope to many patients suffering from ischemic diseases.
