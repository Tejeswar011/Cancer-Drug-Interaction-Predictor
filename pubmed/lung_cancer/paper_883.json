Treatment with CAR-T cells has produced remarkable clinical responses, especially in cases of relapsed and refractory leukemia and lymphoma. However, CAR-T cell therapy still presents several limitations, including some safety concerns related to neurotoxicity and aggressive inflammatory responses. As an alternative to T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells have been developed as an attractive option for efficient cancer immunotherapy. As they do not express T cell receptor (TCR), NK cell-based therapies are not associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or graft versus host disease (GvHD), which enables a safer therapy and the ability to generate an allogeneic “off-the-shelf” product. Despite the innate cytotoxic activity of NK cells against malignant cells, the therapeutic application of unmodified NK cells has been compromised by the inhibitory tumor microenvironment (TME), which is responsible for poor cell expansion, inactivation, insufficient tumor infiltration, and limited in vivo persistence, leading to the dysfunction of NK cells after infusion. Advances in the genetic modification of NK cells can address some of these limitations and improve their therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we describe the advances in the development of engineered NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. As such, we provide an overview of recent viral and non-viral approaches for the genetic modification of NK cells. We also discuss their current clinical status in the field of immunotherapy, and their use in other clinical applications.

Introduction Gene therapy is based on the modification of gene expression to alter the biological properties of cells to treat genetic disorders that are resistant to conventional therapies. This technology paves the way for the development of novel strategies in which different cells can be altered for therapeutic use. In recent decades, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has led to the development of innovative and more effective therapeutic strategies. Among them, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based immunotherapy has emerged as a potential treatment for different types of tumors, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors. This strategy involves the use of genetically engineered immune cells that express a CAR to better recognize a specific tumor antigen and kill target cells. 1–3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 In this review, we describe the advances in the development of engineered NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. As such, we provide an overview of recent viral and non-viral approaches for the genetic modification of NK cells. We also discuss their current clinical status in the field of immunotherapy, and their use in other clinical applications. 2. Understanding NK cells NK cells account for 2–10% of circulating lymphocytes and constitute the first barrier of the immune system. NK cells are innate immune cells that exert cytotoxic and inflammatory responses against virally infected and tumor cells. 11 bright neg dim pos 9 12 13 Unlike T cells, NK cells do not express antigen-specific receptors and do not need a prior encounter with the antigen; thus, they kill target cells spontaneously in an antigen-independent manner. 14 15 Figure 1A 16 17 Figure 1. NK cell receptors and killing strategies. A) Surface activating and inhibitory receptors expressed in NK cells. NK cells express a wide range of stimulatory and inhibitory receptors to discriminate between healthy and malignant cells. B) Mechanism of action of NK cells to distinguish self from non-shelf. MHC-I and the balance between activating and inhibitory receptors dictate rules of NK cells activation. C) Killing mechanisms of NK cells against target cells. Created by BioRender. Different inhibitory receptors, such as killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), are in charge of the mechanism known as “self-tolerance,” by which NK cells recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I molecules expressed on normal cells and prevent NK cell auto-reactivity. It is important to highlight that the expression of these inhibitory receptors on NK cells is stochastic, which means that there are NK cells with inhibitory receptors that recognize self-MHC-I and NK cells that do not. To understand how NK cells carrying inhibitory receptors for non-self-MHC-I do not destroy normal cells and how self-tolerance is formed, several groups have launched the notion of NK cell licensing/arming/education that argues about the higher response of licensed/armed/educated NK cells. Because NK cells expressing inhibitory receptors that bind to self-MHC-I are known to be functionally stronger, they do also exhibit a tighter regulation when compared to unlicensed/unarmed/uneducated NK cells to prevent the response against normal self-MHC-I expressing cells and thus, the threshold for activation is higher. 18–20 18 21 22 23 24 25 Figure 1B Upon activation, NK cells directly kill malignant cells by releasing cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzyme, in a process known as degranulation. Perforin forms pores in the target cell membrane, allowing granzyme entry to induce apoptosis. NK cells can also trigger target cell death via death receptor-mediated cytotoxicity. NK cells express the Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and lymphotoxin alpha (LTα), which bind to the surface receptors of target cells, activating the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. 26 27 28 Figure 1C 3. NK cells in the clinic: an overview The exploitation of NK cells in the clinic for cancer treatment came naturally, given the NK cell property of spontaneously eliminating tumor cells in an MHC-I independent manner. Early clinical trials analyzed the safety and efficacy of IL-2 combined with patient-derived NK-cell infusion for metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and hematological malignances. 29–38 32 39 vs 40 41 Exploiting NK cell-mediated ADCC, the administration of NK cells along with tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as anti-GD2, cetuximab (anti-EGFR), or trastuzumab (anti-HER2), has also shown promising results in the treatment of recurrent and refractory neuroblastoma, 42 43 44 45 45 In order to accomplish a stronger and more durable NK cell-mediated anti-tumor response, different approaches have been tested by modulating activation, inhibition, and/or survival through different strategies. 15 46 N NCT01727076 N N NCT03899480 47 Some approaches involve the improvement of manufacturing protocols for ex vivo 48 ex vivo NCT02763475 49 ex vivo 50 Strategies that combine activated NK cell infusion with neutralization of immune checkpoints or inhibitory receptors are being evaluated in clinical trials based on promising preclinical studies that demonstrated a positive impact on the efficacy of NK cells. 15 46 51 52 53 54 A most recent approach involved the use of NK cell engagers (NCE) to enhance tumor targeting, NK-cell activation, and immunological synapses between the tumors and the NK cells themselves. Perhaps the most advanced NCE to date is a tri-specific (Tri-KE) against CD33 + NCT03214666 46 55 The introduction of new techniques that allow for genetically engineered immune cells has opened a new avenue for modulating NK cell activity, suppression, and survival, which brings up a new level of complexity and allows for the tailoring of NK cells that can potentially result in stronger and more durable response for a wide variety of cancers. 4. Genetic engineering of NK cells Despite the great potential of NK cells for use in immunotherapy, the immunosuppressive TME and the difficulties arising from poor trafficking and infiltration to the tumor site usually limit their anti-cancer function in solid tumors. To overcome these resistances and augment their cytotoxic potential, molecular engineering and gene editing strategies are currently being used. 56 Understanding the molecular mechanism by which NK cells function as effective killer cells is crucial for implementing appropriate genetic modifications to enhance their capacity to target and eliminate tumor cells. Over the last few years, attempts have been made to improve the effector function of NK cells using different strategies. In order to increasing the cytotoxic capacity, the balance of activating and inhibitory signals in NK cells can be tilted toward activation by transducing the cells with activating receptors. An example is overexpression of a chimeric activating receptor consisting of NKG2D associated with CD3ζ and DAP10 which specifically activates NK cells. 57 58 in vitro in vivo 59 in vivo 60 61 62 in vitro 63 However, one of the main challenges in this field is that NK cells are especially difficult to genetically modify and display resistance to many genetic manipulation methods that work well in T cells. Moreover, the success of genetic modifications is highly dependent on the vector that is used, which should present a certain degree of safety and efficacy, facilitating the entry into the target cell. Furthermore, the source of NK cells impact the efficiency of genetic modification methods used and have their respective advantages and disadvantages (Table S1). Peripheral blood-derived NK cells offer several benefits, such as easy accessibility, a mature phenotype, and strong cytotoxic activity. However, they also present some drawbacks like donor variability, which affects genetic engineering efficiency, and limited cell numbers requiring ex vivo 10 64 + 65 66 67 in vitro 51 68 69 70 71 Next, we provide an overview of the methodologies currently used for the genetic modification of NK cells that are classified into viral and non-viral vectors ( Figure 2 69 Figure 2. Delivery methodologies for engineering NK cells. Strategies for genetic modification of NK cells are classified into viral and non-viral. The most commonly used viral transduction methods are based on lentiviral and retroviral vectors. On the other hand, non-viral transfection technologies include electroporation, nanoparticles, the gene editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 and transposon-based systems. Created by BioRender. 4.1. NK cell viral transduction methods Transduction refers to the incorporation of genetic material into the host genome through viral vectors. These vectors are used as vehicles to introduce genes into different cell types, such as NK cells, resulting in highly efficient and permanent expression of these genes. The most commonly used viral vectors are lentiviral and retroviral vectors. Among them, lentiviral vectors have shown several advantages, including the possibility of transducing both dividing and non-dividing cells, the capacity to incorporate larger transgenes into the host genome (up to 9kb) and a lower risk of inducing insertional mutations or intrinsic genotoxicity. In contrast, retroviral vectors are restricted to proliferating cells and display a higher level of insertional mutagenesis due to their preferential integration into transcriptional start sites and their affinities toward oncogenes. 72 73 + 74 75 76 TM 69 77 Currently, viral-based genetic engineering strategies are the performant approach used for the delivery of CARs into immune cells. In one study, peripheral and cord blood-derived NK cells transduced with anti-CD19 CAR reached approximately 40% transduction efficacy in both sources when a lentiviral vector was used. 78 79 4.2. NK cell non-viral transfection strategies Transfection is a potent tool for engineering cells that allows the delivery of exogenous transgenes or genome-editing reagents for gene modification. 80 81 82 83 84 Thanks to their safer clinical profile, high transfection efficiency, and cost-effective manufacturing process of clinical grade for non-viral vectors, the number of publications based on non-viral transfection of NK cells has dramatically increased in recent years. In most of these studies, the main transfection method used was electroporation, followed by nanoparticles, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated caspase 9 (Cas9) CRISPR/Cas9, and the transposon-based systems. Interestingly, the transposon-based system has been the selected technique for many studies this last year, gaining ground over the other methods ( Figure 3A,B Figure 3. Genetic modification methodologies of NK cells and the state of CAR-NK cells in clinic. A) Bar graph showing the number of manuscripts per year reporting experimental data on genetic modification of NK cells using non-viral vectors since 2015 to May 2025 and B) The percentage of manuscripts using each non-viral methodology. Data was obtained from PubMed. C) Total number of CAR-NK cell-based clinical trials in hematological malignancies, solid tumors and other diseases since 2016 to May 2025 and D) The percentage of the clinical trials that treat each disease. Data was obtained from ClinicalTrials.Gov. 4.2.1. Electroporation Electroporation is one of the earliest and most frequently used non-viral transfection strategy. This method involves the application of a short electrical pulse to induce the formation of transient pores in the cell membrane, boosting the introduction of nucleic acids into cells. 85 86 77 87 88 89 90 Due to the careful optimization of electroporation methodology, several authors have explored its potential for genetically modifying NK cells. One of the first studies carried out by Boissel et al 91 et al 63 62 Electroporation of NK cells with mRNA has also shown promising results compared to lentiviral and retroviral transduction. For example, the NK-92 cell line electroporated with CD19 and CD20 CAR mRNA exhibited greater transfection efficiency than the same cells transduced with a lentiviral vector. 82 58 82 92 Although most electroporation studies on NK cells have focused on the treatment of hematological cancers, engineered NK cells by electroporation also have shown great results in the treatment of solid tumors. In this way, Liu et al 93 4.2.2. Transposon systems In the field of genetic modification techniques, transposable elements (TEs) or transposons represent a unique non-viral approach suitable for NK cell engineering. Transposons are prokaryotic or eukaryotic DNA sequences that can change their position in the genome, altering the gene expression pattern and contributing to genomic evolution. The transposon complex is commonly composed of a mobile transposon vector and a transposase enzyme that removes and reintegrates the vector into a new location in the target DNA. Given these characteristics, transposons have been widely used as mutagenic and transgenic tools, and more recently, for engineering human cells for cellular therapy, including human iPSCs and T cells. 94 95 80 Currently, three main transposon systems are used for genetic engineering, which include Sleeping Beauty (SB), PiggyBac (PB), and Tol2. 96 97 et al 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 96 106 et al 107 Tribolium castaneum 4.3.3. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated strategies In addition to gene transfer strategies for transposon-based NK cell engineering, novel genomic modification technologies have emerged as innovative procedures for targeting specific genes. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was discovered in 2012 108 109–112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 118–120 119 121–123 et al 124 125 4.3.4. Nanoparticles-mediated delivery The generation of different types of nanoparticles designed as non-viral carriers has the potential to address the drawbacks associated with physical methods and viral vectors, such as poor cell viability, restricted loading capacity, and insufficient targeting capabilities. Nanoparticles (NPs) range in size from 20 to 100 nm and form complexes with cargo molecules, protecting them from degradation and facilitating the transfection process. 126 127 128 129–131 132 Despite the fact that LNPs have been mostly used for T cell engineering, there are a few studies on NK cells with encouraging results, especially those focused on the delivery of siRNA 133 134 et al 135 136 et al 137 134 Other studies have focused not only on improving the transfection of NK cells through different design systems but also on facilitating their nanomolecular visualization into the tumor site. For instance, NPs can be developed with a magnetic core that allows them to be tracked in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, NPs can be stained with fluorescent molecules for visualization using optical imaging systems. Zhuo et al 138 et al 139 As an example of another approach to engineer NK cells with nanomaterials, Wilk et al 140 5. Clinical applications of engineered CAR-NK cells Despite CAR-T cells have revolutionized immunotherapy in the field of oncology, NK cells have emerged as a potential alternative with a safer profile, opening the possibility of an “off-the shelf” therapy and promoting the rapid translation of the therapy into the clinic ( Figure 3C,D Currently, most clinical trials based on CAR-NK cells are focused on the treatment of hematological cancers ( Table 1 + NCT02944162 141 et al NCT03056339 61 + 142 + NCT05020678 143 Table 1.

CRISPR/Cas9 technology, has gained momentum because of safety concerns, high manufacturing costs, and vector capacity constraints that entail viral methods. A testament to this is all the recent preclinical studies that have been carried out looking for better transduction efficacy and anti-tumor responses, as previously mentioned. To date, there have been three clinical trials based on non-viral engineered CAR-NK cells that used electroporation of mRNA (two studies) or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (one study) as transfection methods ( Table 3 NCT01974479 et al NCT03415100 146 NCT05182073 147 Table 3.

Conclusion remarks The innate ability of NK cells to specifically kill malignant cells without prior encounter with the antigen and the possibility of an “off-the-shelf” product make them excellent candidates for ACT. Early trials using autologous or allogeneic donor-derived NK cells demonstrated their safety profile and minimal toxicity, overcoming some of the drawbacks of CAR-T cell therapies. Infusion of unmodified allogeneic NK cells in both HSCT and non-HSCT settings has shown complete hematologic remission in patients with AML and myeloid malignancies but not in solid tumors. Although additional strategies have been explored to accomplish a stronger and more durable NK cell-mediated anti-tumor response, the real breakthrough came with advances in genetic engineering technologies, especially the introduction of CAR to redirect NK cells specifically against cancer cells. One of the main challenges in this field is that NK cells are especially difficult to genetically modify, and display resistance to many genetic manipulation methods that work well in T cells. Moreover, the success of genetic modifications is highly dependent on the vector that is used, which should present a certain degree of safety and efficacy, facilitating the entry into the target cell. Fortunately, technological advancements such as enhanced cell expansion, more efficient CAR, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, and improved viral transduction and electroporation methods, are making it possible to overcome these obstacles. In fact, the use of non-viral methodologies to transfect NK cells is experiencing immense growth and rapid advancement in preclinical studies. For example, since SARS-CoV-2 emergence, LNPs-based delivery systems have emerged as promising carriers for the delivery of nucleic acids to NK cells. In addition, thanks to the versatility of NPs, some studies are investigating their use in encapsulating the CRISPR/Cas9 complex and mediating its entry into cells. This methodology has displayed a certain in vivo potential in several cancer models, but its success in the transfection of NK cells is still limited. Despite advancements in non-viral strategies, to date, there have been only three clinical trials based on non-viral engineered CAR-NK cells, one of which has been suspended. Two of these trials used electroporation of mRNA and the other used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing as a transfection method. Research to achieve a stronger and more durable NK cell-mediated anti-tumor response is rapidly progressing, and we expect that novel and/or refined delivery technologies and gene editing tools will emerge to improve NK cell therapies in the near future.
