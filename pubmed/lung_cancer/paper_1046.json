Quantitative 4D proteomic-sequencing analysis identified upregulated KNG1 in 3- and 15-month-old C57BL/6J mouse skin, with immunohistochemical staining corroborating its increase in intrinsic aging. KNG1 overexpression in murine skin reduced dermal thickness, collagen fibre content, elastic fibre density, aging marker Lamin B1, and increased oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), while KNG1 knockdown ameliorated these aging-associated phenotypes. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed the underlying mechanisms. KNG1 regulates elastic fibre degradation through membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME) activity, modulates collagen fibre degradation via matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and elevates oxidative stress through epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2). Thus, KNG1 may serve as an intrinsic skin aging biomarker, promoting collagen fibre degradation through MMP1/MMP9, elastic fibre breakdown through MME, and oxidative stress through EPHX2. KNG1 downregulation may represent a prospective anti-aging target.

The phenomenon of skin aging can be categorized into exogenous aging, primarily driven by environmental factors such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and endogenous aging, which occurs intrinsically over time. Endogenous dermal aging is marked by a decrease in skin thickness, an increase in the formation of wrinkles, and a sagging appearance 1 2 3 5 6 7 9 10 11 Kininogen-1 (KNG1) protein, also referred to as high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) and encoded by the KNG1 gene, is a notable pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant factor implicated in various inflammatory diseases, including lung tissue sepsis 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 This study aimed to reveal the role and the underlying mechanisms of KNG1 in skin aging. We employed quantitative 4D proteomic-sequencing analysis to detect the expression of KNG1 in the skin of C57BL/6J mice at different ages. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect KNG1 expression in the skin of both humans and mice with intrinsic aging. Furthermore, the role of KNG1 in the process of skin aging was comprehensively examined by analyzing morphological alterations, modifications in collagen fibers and elastic fibers in the skin following subcutaneous lentiviral injection to either overexpress or knockdown KNG1. Immunohistochemical staining for Lamin B1 and 8-Hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was employed to determine the impact of KNG1 on skin aging and oxidative stress levels, respectively. Results The expression levels of KNG1 are elevated during the intrinsic aging process of the skin in both mice and humans To elucidate novel genes involved in intrinsic skin aging, we performed proteomic sequencing on dorsal skin samples from 3-month-old and 15-month-old female C57BL/6J mice. A total of 5554 proteins were identified through this proteomic analysis. Applying the predefined screening criteria, we identified 141 differentially expressed proteins. Among these, 84 proteins were significantly upregulated in the 15-month-old group, and 57 proteins were significantly downregulated. Notably, KNG1 was one of the top 20 proteins with the most significant changes in terms of p 1A p −6 1B 1C–F Fig. 1 The expression levels of KNG1 are increased during the intrinsic aging process of the skin in both mice and humans.

We conducted an investigation into human intrinsic skin aging utilizing the GSE106940 S1A 1G, H S1B, C These findings imply that KNG1 expression is elevated during the intrinsic aging process of the skin in both mice and humans. The overexpression of KNG1 results in a phenotype characterized by dermal atrophy associated with aging To investigate whether KNG1 functions as a key regulatory molecule in skin aging, lentiviruses for both knockdown and overexpression of KNG1 were conducted. In addition, these lentiviruses were injected into the specific sites of the back skin of mice as indicated in Fig. S2 S3A 2A–D S3B– D Fig. 2 The overexpression of KNG1 induces an aging phenotype characterized by dermal atrophy. After subcutaneous injection of empty vector (NC), interference vector (shKNG1), and overexpression vector (oeKNG1) into 6-month-old C57BL/6J female mice for 7 days, the skin tissues from sacrificed mice were processed into paraffin-embedded sections.

IHC analysis revealed that overexpression of KNG1 resulted in a significant reduction in Lamin B1 expression in 6-month-old mice, whereas knockdown of KNG1 led to an increase in Lamin B1 expression (Fig. 2I, J 2K, L To determine whether KNG1 knockdown could ameliorate intrinsic age-related phenotypes, we transfected the knockdown lentiviruses into the skin of 18-month-old mice. A schematic diagram of the lentivirus subcutaneous injection is shown in Fig. S4A S4B, C S4D, E These data indicate that KNG1 plays a role in regulating the proliferation and senescence of primary mouse fibroblasts. Specifically, overexpression of KNG1 is associated with skin atrophy, thinning, and accelerated aging, while knockdown of KNG1 leads to increased skin thickness and decreased aging. KNG1 modulates the degradation of collagen fibers in the skin via MMP9 and MMP1 Furthermore, we examined the effect of KNG1 on collagen fibers. Masson’s trichrome staining revealed that the overexpression of KNG1 resulted in a sparse and disorganized dermal collagen architecture in the dermis of 6-month-old mice, characterized by fragmented and dissolved collagen fibers and a reduction in collagen density. In contrast, the knockdown of KNG1 led to an increase in collagen density and a more organized arrangement of collagen fibers in the dermis of 6-month-old mice (Fig. 3A, B S4F, G Fig. 3 KNG1 modulates the degradation of collagen fibers in the skin via MMP9. After subcutaneous injection of NC, shKNG1, and oeKNG1 into 6-month-old C57BL/6J female mice for 7 days, the skin tissues from sacrificed mice were processed into paraffin-embedded sections. A B n p p C D E p F G F n p In order to investigate the mechanism through which KNG1 affects dermal collagen fibers, we conducted an analysis of all collagen-related genes from the KEGG database within the STRING database to identify potential protein interactions with KNG1. Our findings revealed a previously established protein interaction between MMP9 and KNG1, with a combined interaction score of 0.474 (Fig. 3C 22 23 S5A, B To examine the potential influence of KNG1 on collagen fiber degradation via modulation of MMP9, we assessed the expression levels of MMP9 in the dermal tissue of mice with either KNG1 knockdown or overexpression. The findings from immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses indicated an upregulation of MMP9 expression in the skin of mice with KNG1 overexpression, whereas a downregulation was observed in the skin of mice with KNG1 knockdown (Fig. 3D–G Considering that MMP1 is the most important member of collagenases in the dermis of the skin, we further examined the relationship between KNG1 and MMP1. Immunohistochemistry revealed an upregulation of MMP1 expression in the skin of mice with KNG1 overexpression, whereas a downregulation was observed in the skin of mice with KNG1 knockdown (Fig. S6 These findings indicate that KNG1 may play a role in the regulation of dermal collagen fiber degradation via MMP9 and MMP1. KNG1 regulates the degradation of dermal elastic fibers via MME Gomori aldehyde-magenta staining revealed that overexpression of KNG1 led to a significant reduction in the area of dermal elastic fibers, resulting in fragmented fibers with only a few retaining an elongated morphology. Conversely, knockdown of KNG1 resulted in an increased area of dermal elastic fibers, characterized by thinner and relatively elongated fibers oriented in multiple directions, predominantly parallel to the skin surface (Fig. 4A, B 4 Fig. 4 KNG1 regulates the degradation of dermal elastic fibers via MME.

KNG1 regulates oxidative stress levels in the skin via EPHX2 Utilizing 8-OHdG as a marker for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oxidative damage products to assess oxidative stress levels, our findings indicate that knockdown of KNG1 mitigates oxidative stress in the skin, whereas overexpression of KNG1 intensifies it (Fig. 5A, B 26 4E S5E, F 5C–F Fig. 5 KNG1 regulates oxidative stress levels in the skin via EPHX2.

A B A n p C D p E F E n p p These findings imply that KNG1 may regulate oxidative stress in the dermal environment through its influence on EPHX2 expression. Discussion Previous research has documented elevated plasma concentrations of KNG1 as a coagulation factor during physiological aging 27 28 In aged dermal tissue, collagen fibers exhibit fragmentation and irregular distribution, in contrast to the abundant, dense, and well-organized collagen fibers present in youthful skin 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 In the process of skin aging, the role of collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain (COL17A1) localized in the epidermal basal layer in maintaining skin homeostasis is attracting attention. COL17A1, a hemidesmosome component of the dermal-epidermal basement membrane, mediates keratinocyte adhesion to the underlying basement membrane to maintain epidermal integrity, but its progressive downregulation during intrinsic aging weakens hemidesmosomes and impairs dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) integrity 36 37 In this study, our findings indicate that the overexpression of KNG1 in the intrinsic aging process of mouse skin leads to an upregulation of MME expression, potentially facilitating the degradation of elastin. MME, also known as neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), is capable of degrading a variety of bioactive peptides, including bradykinin 38 39 40 41 42 Oxidative stress induced by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to lipid, protein, nucleic acid, and organelle damage, thus leading to the occurrence of cellular senescence, which is one of the core mechanisms mediating skin aging 43 44 45 46 47 48 2 2 49 50 46 51 52 1 In conclusion, our findings indicate that KNG1 may serve as a biomarker for intrinsic skin aging. Specifically, KNG1 modulates the degradation of skin collagen fibers via MMP1/MMP9, the breakdown of elastic fibers via MME, and the elevation of oxidative stress levels via EPHX2. Furthermore, the reduction of KNG1 may represent a potential target for interventions aimed at mitigating skin aging. These insights highlight the significant implications of KNG1 in the field of dermatological aging research. Methods Human skin specimen collection Human skin specimens were obtained as discarded tissue during clinically indicated procedures from healthy female donors. The tissue repository included eyelid skin (from 23- and 50-year-olds) and sun-protected back skin (from 14- and 62-year-olds). All specimens were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for subsequent histological analyses. This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (Approval No. 2024-ER-055) and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating volunteers prior to sample collection. Bioinformatics analysis Gene expression data related to sun-protected human skin were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GSE106940 GPL570 n n U p Dorsal skin samples were obtained from female C57BL/6J mice aged 3 months (3 M) and 15 months (15 M). Label-free 4D proteomic analysis (Jingjie PTM BioLab, Hangzhou) identified a total of 5554 proteins, generating normalized spectral data that yielded relative protein expression levels (dimensionless units). For expression analysis, the younger group (3 M, three biological replicates: 3M-1/2/3) served as the control, and the older group (15 M, three biological replicates: 15M-1/2/3) as the experimental group. Group means were calculated to reduce replicate variation, with fold change determined as 15 M mean/3 M mean, and log₂ transformation applied to quantify expression differences. Genes with a p 2 https://www.kegg.jp/ https://cn.string-db.org/ Mice Female C57BL/6J mice, aged 3, 6, 9, 15, and 18 months, were procured from the Laboratory Animal Center of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China (SCXK 2021-0041). The mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled environment at 23 ± 2 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were provided with ad libitum access to food and water.

The 8-OHdG (Catalog No. bs-1278R) antibody was purchased from Bioss, Beijing, China, and β-Actin (Catalog No. RM2001) was obtained from Rayay, Beijing, China. Primary fibroblast culture The dorsal skin of 6-month-old female C57BL/6J mice was utilized in this study. Following the removal of hair and sterilization, the skin was excised and positioned in a petri dish with the dermis oriented upwards. The tissue underwent enzymatic digestion using trypsin for a duration of 18 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the epidermis was separated from the dermis, and the dermal tissue was excised and processed further. The tissue was enzymatically digested using collagenase I for a duration of 30 min, followed by filtration and centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in a culture medium before being inoculated into 6 cm culture dishes. The culture medium comprised low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 Lentiviral infection Lentiviruses carrying the empty vector pCLenti-U6-shRNA(NC)-CMV-EGFP-WPRE, the KNG1-interfering vector pCLenti-U6-shRNA(KNG1)-CMV-EGFP-WPRE, KNG1 overexpression vector pcSLenti-EF1-EGFP-CMV-Kng1-WPRE were purchased from Obio Technology (Shanghai) Corp, Ltd. Six-month-old female C57BL/6J mice were anaesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital (Sigma; 0.01 ml/g body weight). All dorsal skin follicles were observed to be in the telogen phase, characterized by a consistent pinkish hue. To address individual variability, the dorsal region of each mouse was sectioned into four circles, each with a 1 cm radius, arranged in a centrosymmetric pattern. In Zone 1, designated as the control group (CON group), a subcutaneous injection of 20 μL Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) was administered. In Zone 2, the empty lentivirus injection control group (NC group) received a subcutaneous injection of 20 μL of an empty lentivirus vector at a concentration of 1 × 10 8 8 8 S2 The titers of the empty vector pCLenti-U6-shRNA(NC)-CMV-EGFP-WPRE, the KNG1-interfering vector pCLenti-U6-shRNA(KNG1)-CMV-EGFP-WPRE, and the overexpression vector pcSLenti-EF1-EGFP-CMV-Kng1-WPRE were measured at 3.52 × 10 8 8 8 Cell proliferation assay P3 generation mouse fibroblasts were cultured in 24-well plastic plates at a density of 1 × 10 5 Senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining Cells were seeded into 24-well plastic plates and covered with cell coverslips. Following 72 h of lentiviral transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 10% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, and subsequently stained with a freshly prepared β-galactosidase staining solution (Beyotime, China) at 37 °C overnight. Microscopic images were captured, and the β-galactosidase-positive cells were quantified using ImageJ software (USA). Histological examination Fresh mouse skin samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Macklin, China) at 4 °C for a duration of 3 to 7 days. Subsequently, the samples underwent dehydration through an ethanol gradient, followed by clearing with xylene (GHTECH, Guangzhou, China), and were then embedded in paraffin (LEICA, Germany). The tissues were sectioned into slices of 5-μm thickness, deparaffinized via xylene immersion, and rehydrated. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed following standard protocols. Additionally, Masson’s trichrome and Gomori’s elastic fiber staining (Solarbio, Beijing, China) were executed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunohistochemical assay Tissue sections underwent dewaxing using xylene, followed by hydration. Thermal antigen retrieval was conducted by heating the samples in citrate buffer (Boster, Wuhan, China). Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited using 3% hydrogen peroxide. Subsequently, the sections were blocked with 10% goat serum (SolarBio, Beijing, China). The following primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C: KNG1 (dilution 1:200), MME (dilution 1:200), EPHX2 (dilution 1:200), MMP1 (dilution 1:200), MMP9 (dilution 1:200), Lamin B1 (dilution 1:200), ELN (dilution 1:200), and 8-OHdG (dilution 1:100). The tissue sections underwent counterstaining with haematoxylin, followed by dehydration through an ethanol gradient, clearing with xylene, and sealing. Microscopic examination was conducted using a Leica DM40008 microscope (Leica, Germany), and images were acquired with the Leica Application Suite version 3.7. Quantitative analysis of sample staining, including the percentage of positive area and the count of positively stained cells, was performed utilizing ImageJ software version 1.8. Western blot analysis Skin tissue samples and cultured cells were lysed utilizing RIPA(Radio Immunoprecipitation Assay) Lysis buffer (Beyotime) and subjected to three cycles of milling at −30 °C with a cryomill (Luka, Guangzhou, China). The resultant protein extracts underwent centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subsequently collected, combined with loading buffer in a 1:1 ratio, and heated to 95 °C to achieve protein denaturation. The protein samples were then resolved on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) employing pre-stained molecular weight markers (Epizyme, Shanghai, China) and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were subjected to a blocking procedure for 1 h using QuickBlock™ Blocking Buffer (Beyotime). Subsequently, they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: KNG1 (dilution 1:1000), MME (dilution 1:2000), MMP9 (dilution 1:1000), EPHX2 (dilution 1:1000), and β-Actin (dilution 1:2000). Following incubation, the membranes were washed with 1× TBST at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h with either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. The binding of antibodies was visualized using the Meilunbio Feikert Ultrasensitive Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Luminescent Solution. The protein bands were visualized utilizing a fully automated chemiluminescence image analysis system (Tanon 5200CE ) Statistical analysis The data were analyzed utilizing GraphPad Prism version 8.0.2 software and are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
