However, the role of TRMs in the lymph nodes (LNs) remains unclear. Thus, we examined the prognostic impact of TRMs infiltration within LNs of patients with gastric cancer (GC). Among 151 patients with metastasis to LN station No. 3, we classified them into two groups (CD103 hi lo + + + + + hi p p hi lo p p + + hi The role of resident memory T cells (TRM) in the lymph nodes remains unclear. Thus, we examined the prognostic impact of TRM cell infiltration in lymph nodes among gastric cancer patients with lymph node metastasis. As a result, we revealed that the infiltration of TRM cells into lymph nodes is a significant prognostic factor both in resected and adjuvant cases.

We excluded patients with the following characteristics: (1) pathological special type ( n n Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical studies were performed on metastatic LNs and primary lesions. The histological type and tumor localization were determined according to the 14th edition of the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association (JGCA) classification. The intestinal type (highly/moderately differentiated/papillary adenocarcinoma)/diffuse type (poorly differentiated/mucinous adenocarcinoma/signet ring cell carcinoma) were determined according to the main histological type. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Osaka Metropolitan University (approval number: #4092). 2.2 Immunohistochemistry Tissues from the GC and metastatic LNs were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were cut into 4 μm sections and slides were made. After incubation at 60°C for 10 min, sections were deparaffinized in xylene. They were then treated with ethanol. The slides were then treated with methanol containing 3% H 2 2 The antibodies used in this study are as follows. Rabbit monoclonal anti‐CD103 (clone: EPR4166 (2); cat. no. ab1292202; 1/1000; Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti‐CD8 (clone: C8/144B; cat. no. M7103; 1/250; Dako), rabbit monoclonal anti‐PD‐1 (clone: EPR4877 (2); cat. no. ab137132; 1/250; Abcam). 2.3 Evaluation of Immunohistochemistry Slides stained with CD103 and PD‐1 were digitized using Leica Aperio CS2, and the number of stained positive cells in tumor‐infiltrated area was calculated using Qupath (an open software application). The cut‐off value was calculated using the ROC curve based on the 5‐year survival rate after surgery and the number of CD103‐positive cells. The patients were divided into two groups (CD103 high group/low group) based on the cutoff value. PD‐1 expression was evaluated, and cases in the CD103 high group were stratified into two subgroups based on the number of PD‐1 positive cells. 2.4 Double Staining of Immunofluorescence Paraffin‐embedded sections of the main GC and LNs were cut at 4 μm and fixed on a slide. Blocking One Hist (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was used to prevent non‐specific adsorption of antibodies. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C. The sections were then reacted with the fluorescent labeled secondary antibodies (anti‐mouse and anti‐rabbit) at room temperature for 1 h. The sections were then reacted with DAPI at room temperature for 10 min to stain the nucleus. The sections were sealed using ProLong Gold antifade reagent. Digital images were taken with an all‐in‐one microscope (Keyence X800). 2.5 Flow Cytometry Fifteen patients with LN metastasis who underwent gastrectomy in 2023 were included in the analysis. After collecting and cutting the metastatic LNs, they were incubated in RPMI medium containing type 1 collagen and DNase. After that, they were filtered through a 70 μm filter and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min to isolate single‐cell suspensions. They were then incubated with antibodies against cell surface markers for 30 min on ice. Initial gating was performed to exclude debris and doublets using FSC‐A vs. SSC‐A and FSC‐H vs. FSC‐W plots. Dead cells were identified using Fixable Viability Stain 780 (cat. no. 565388, BD Biosciences). Single‐stained controls were employed to define gating boundaries. Gates were set for CD8 and CD103 to evaluate CD8 + + − + The primary antibodies used were as follows. To identify TRM: BUV496‐labeled anti‐CD8 (clone: RPA‐T8: cat. no. 612943; BD Biosciences), BV421‐labeled anti‐CD103 (clone: Ber‐ACT8: cat. no. 566257; BD Biosciences). T cell exhaustion marker: BB700‐labeled anti‐Tim‐3 (clone: 7D3: cat. no. 746178; BD Biosciences), RY586‐labeled anti‐PD‐1 (clone: EH12.1: cat. no. 568118; BD Biosciences). 2.6 Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using EZR (free software) and RStudio (free software). Kaplan–Meier curves were used to compare overall survival (OS) and recurrence‐free survival (RFS), and the significance of differences in survival was analyzed using the log‐rank test. RFS was defined as the time from surgery to recurrence or death, whereas OS was defined as the time from surgery to death. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Continuous variables between the two groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test or Student's t p 3 Results 3.1  LN Of the 749 patients, 302 had metastatic LNs and 151 had metastasis to LN station No. 3 (Figure 1A,B p 1C p 1D FIGURE 1 Patients' selection and survival analysis depending on lymph node metastasis.
