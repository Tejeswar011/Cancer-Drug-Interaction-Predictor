However, there is a lack of systematic reports on the incidence and clinical characteristics of mesothelioma in the Chinese population. Objectives: This study aims to characterize the epidemiological features of mesothelioma in the Chinese population and to evaluate the effectiveness of current treatment strategies, to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient care. Designs: The epidemiological characteristics of patients were collected by regional study centers according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Asbestos exposure status was clearly identified for each patient, and treatment strategies were analyzed across mesothelioma cases with different primary tumor sites. Methods: Data on mesothelioma patients and their treatment information were collected from 11 hospitals across China between January 2006 and December 2024. Epidemiological data and baseline characteristics were summarized using descriptive methods. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to analyze progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Key response indicators included the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Results: A total of 927 patients from 11 provinces in China were included in the analysis. The major types of mesothelioma observed were pleural mesothelioma ( n n n n n n Conclusion: The incidence of mesothelioma in China exhibits distinct regional characteristics. Pleural mesothelioma is predominantly associated with crocidolite asbestos exposure in Yunnan Province, while peritoneal mesothelioma is linked to hand-spun chrysotile asbestos exposure in Zhejiang Province, with notable sex differences observed. No significant differences in treatment outcomes were identified between pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma patients undergoing first-line therapy. These findings highlight the importance of region-specific strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of mesothelioma in China. asbestos exposure epidemiology mesothelioma pathological types treatment pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes cover-date January-December 2025 typesetter ts1 Introduction Mesothelioma is a rare and highly aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis. 1 2  3  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 Regarding first-line treatment for mesothelioma, the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin has been the standard therapy regimen.  10  11  12 13 14 To enhance understanding of the different types of mesothelioma, the current study aims to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and asbestos exposure-related risks among patients in China. Concrete statistical data were collected to provide fundamental references for mesothelioma prevention. Moreover, this study incorporated systematic therapy analyses to assess the efficacy of various treatment regimens, offering a comprehensive overview of real-world therapeutic practices. The findings could serve as a valuable resource for developing future treatment strategies and alternative options for mesothelioma patients. Methods Patient eligibility Patients with pathologically confirmed mesothelioma, reviewed by pathologists from 11 different provinces in China—Zhejiang, Yunnan, Fujian, Anhui, Shanxi, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Qinghai, and Jiangsu—between January 2006 and December 2024, were included. All data were retrospectively collected from hospitals located in the aforementioned regions. The research centers participating in this study include the following: Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture People’s Hospital, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital, Affiliated Jinling Hospital of Medical School of Nanjing University, Anhui Chest Hospital, Huzhou Central Hospital, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Lishui Municipal Central Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, The Cancer Hospital of Qinghai Province, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, The 900th Hospital of the Joint Logistics Team, Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou First People’s Hospital, Quhua Hospital, Quzhou People’s Hospital, Fujian Cancer Hospital, and Bethune Hospital of Shanxi Province. Primary medical records completed by the treating physicians were collected according to uniform criteria across all research centers. Mesothelioma was classified into four major subtypes: pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal mesothelioma, pericardial mesothelioma, and mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis. Patients at all stages were eligible for analysis. Baseline characteristics, including sex, age, performance status, pathological type, sites of metastases, smoking history, surgical history, and radiotherapy history, were recorded. For patients with confirmed asbestos exposure, details such as the site of exposure and duration were also documented. Asbestos exposure can occur in workplaces, schools, homes, or military settings, with occupational exposure being the most common. Family members of asbestos workers may also be at risk of secondary exposure. Other sources include household products, talcum powder, or damaged asbestos in old homes and buildings. There is no safe level of asbestos exposure, and both the intensity and duration of exposure influence the risk of asbestos-related diseases. Therefore, exposure duration was incorporated into our analysis to establish a comprehensive assessment method for asbestos exposure. All relevant asbestos exposure data were sourced from the electronic medical records maintained by each participating study center. Exclusion criteria included patients with severe underlying diseases, other malignancies, or abnormal liver and kidney function. Individuals with severe infectious diseases—such as hepatitis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or tuberculosis—were also excluded. Patients with biphasic mesothelioma involving both the pleura and peritoneum were not included in this study. The research adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki, and individual consent was waived across all research centers. The study was approved by the leading institutional review board of Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture People’s Hospital (approval number: IRB-2025-017). The reporting of this study conforms to the statement of ESMO Guidance for Reporting Oncology real-world evidence.  15 Treatment methods Patients who received systemic treatment were included in survival analyses, and their therapy regimens were recorded. The most common first-line treatments were a combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin, or a triple regimen of pemetrexed, cisplatin, and bevacizumab. For patients intolerant to cisplatin, carboplatin was allowed as a substitute. Less common regimens, such as paclitaxel with cisplatin or carboplatin, were also analyzed. Immunotherapy was primarily represented by nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Single-agent immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy or anti-angiogenic therapy was permitted. All treatment regimens and dosages followed clinical guidelines and recommendations from relevant clinical trials. Each therapy cycle was scheduled every 3 weeks, with adjustments made based on patient condition. To clarify the overall treatment strategy, the regimens were classified into three main subgroups: C (chemotherapy alone), C + A (chemotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy), and Contain I (chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy or dual immunotherapy). Survivals and follow-up Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were the primary survival outcomes. PFS was defined as the time from initiation of systemic therapy to disease progression, while OS was calculated from the start of systemic therapy to death from any cause or the last follow-up. The final follow-up date was December 31, 2024. Responses All patients receiving systemic therapy underwent response evaluations. Baseline tumor size was assessed using computed tomography (CT). CT scans were conducted every two therapy cycles to monitor efficacy and adjust treatment strategies. In cases of disease progression, CT results were recorded. Magnetic resonance imaging or bone scans were incorporated when necessary. Ultrasonography was used to evaluate lymph node involvement. Tumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Response indicators included objective response rate (ORR)—the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)—and disease control rate (DCR), which comprised CR, PR, and stable disease (SD). Progressive disease (PD) indicates ineffective treatment. Statistical analyses Baseline characteristics and epidemiological data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to generate survival curves, and comparisons between groups were performed using the log-rank test.

Discussion To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to systematically analyze the epidemiology of mesothelioma, its clinical characteristics, and the impact of asbestos exposure in the Chinese population. The results revealed distinct regional characteristics and patterns of mesothelioma distribution, particularly in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces. The type of asbestos exposure had a significant influence on mesothelioma patients. In Yunnan, crocidolite asbestos was the primary exposure, while in Zhejiang, hand-spun chrysotile asbestos from small workshops was the leading cause of peritoneal mesothelioma. Regarding treatment, different therapeutic regimens did not show a significant survival difference in pleural mesothelioma, with a similar trend observed in peritoneal mesothelioma. Furthermore, this study compared the characteristics of pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, highlighting notable differences between the two, which could provide useful insights for clinical practice in the future. Genetic mutations and environmental factors, such as asbestos exposure, contribute to the development of mesothelioma. Previous studies have identified BAP1 mutations as being prevalent in mesothelioma patients, 16 17 CDKN2A CDKN2B NF2 18 19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26 In the present study, significant asbestos exposure was observed in certain regions of China. In Yunnan Province, exposure to crocidolite asbestos primarily affected male patients, with the majority suffering from pleural mesothelioma. Liu et al.  27  28 Overall, regional environmental factors played a key role in determining the types of mesothelioma observed in different areas of China. Amphibole asbestos types, including crocidolite, have been completely banned nationwide in China since July 2002. The only exception is chrysotile, which is still permitted for limited use under strict occupational health regulations and exposure limits. To further explore the impact of asbestos exposure, research has shown that asbestos bans correlate with a decline in mesothelioma incidence.  29  30 Regarding the treatment of advanced mesothelioma, traditional chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin remains the gold standard. The addition of bevacizumab to this regimen has been shown to improve survival by nearly 3 months.  11  31  32  33  34  35 NF2 BAP1 CDKN2A There are several limitations to this study. First, patient data from certain areas of China were not collected, which should be addressed in future research. Second, some basic information, such as smoking history, was unavailable. Additionally, the sample size for certain therapy subgroups was insufficient, especially for the combination regimen, and there was a lack of research on mesothelioma originating from the pericardium and tunica vaginalis, which should be explored further. Besides, a proportion of cases in our cohort were categorized as an unknown subgroup, including the tumor origin and some pathological subtypes, which means that this missing information may introduce bias and limit the interpretability of subgroup analyses. Future studies with more complete pathological data are warranted to validate and expand upon these findings. The present study collected data from selected hospitals across 11 provinces in China. However, this sampling approach is not ideal for accurately assessing the true incidence of this disease in the general population. The limitation is particularly evident given that not all cancer centers within these provinces participated in the study. Therefore, future research should aim to establish population-based cohort studies that systematically collect data on asbestos exposure in healthy individuals and conduct long-term follow-up to determine how many eventually develop mesothelioma. Such an approach would enable a more accurate estimation of the population-level incidence of mesothelioma. And further studies should also investigate additional therapeutic regimens to provide alternative options for mesothelioma patients. Conclusion The incidence of mesothelioma exhibits regional characteristics. In Yunnan Province, pleural mesothelioma is primarily caused by crocidolite asbestos exposure, while in Zhejiang Province, hand-spun chrysotile asbestos exposure is the leading cause of peritoneal mesothelioma. These findings highlight the regional variations in the origins of mesothelioma. In Yunnan, the mining industry is associated with a high risk of inhaling crocidolite asbestos, while in Zhejiang, the small workshops where people produce hand-spun chrysotile asbestos lead to increased accidental ingestion. Pleural mesothelioma predominantly affects males, while peritoneal mesothelioma is more common in females. As for treatment, no significant survival difference was observed between different regimens in pleural mesothelioma. Peritoneal mesothelioma showed similar results. The authors would like to appreciate all patients and their families for their cooperation. In addition, we are thankful to all the research staff and co-investigators involved in this investigation.
