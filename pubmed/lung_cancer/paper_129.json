Introduction Glycosylation is a post-translational modification that plays a crucial role in immune system activity. Phosphomannomutase 2-Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (PMM2-CDG) is a rare genetic disease affecting glycosylation with a multi-systemic impact. PMM2-CDG patients commonly show immune disfunction and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels that may link to other symptoms. However, the underlying immune mechanisms remain unclear. Given Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)’s key role in inflammation, this study proposes that defective glycosylation of its receptors disrupts intracellular signalling, leading to changes in the immune response of PMM2-CDG patients. Methods To address this, we applied an integrative approach, combining transcriptomics, glycomics, and immune-related assays to investigate the impact of TNF-a stimulation via TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) in a cohort of PMM2-CDG patients’ skin fibroblasts. Results Our results reveal a multifaceted disruption of TNF-a signalling in PMM2-CDG fibroblasts. We observed structural abnormalities in TNFR1, including altered receptor shedding. PMM2-CDG cells also showed an altered N-glycosylation profile, affecting particularly, high mannose N-glycans. At transcriptional level, PMM2-CDG cells, especially those bearing the R141H heterozygous variant, exhibited a distinct gene expression profile, after stimulation, characterized by dysregulation of immune and signalling pathways. Functionally, these molecular alterations translated into a diminished secretion of key inflammation and infection mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-C Motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) upon TNF-a stimulation. Similarly, essential signalling kinases including extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, p38 and c-Jun N- terminal kinase (JNK) 2 showed reduced expression in PMM2-CDG cells, and their expression did not alter following TNF-a stimulation, unlike control cells. Conslusion Our findings point to TNFR1 signalling dysregulation as a key contributor to immune dysfunction in PMM2-CDG. Importantly, our study identifies TNFR1 as a promising therapeutic target, suggesting that strategies aimed at modulating TNFR1 activity or restoring glycosylation homeostasis could provide new approaches for treatment development. This work advances our understanding of PMM2 -CDG immunopathology and opens opportunities for targeted therapeutics.

Methods include transcriptomics, glycomics, and immune assays. Results show distinct clustering of PMM2-CDG and control, altered signaling pathways, glycan changes, and compromised immune activation. Quantitative analyses involve principal component analysis, differential expression, enrichment, and mass spectrometry.

For lysates intended for signalling proteins detection, Na 3 4 Signal was revealed using the Lumi-Light Western Blotting Substrate (Roche) to X-ray films (Amersham HyperfilmTM ECL). For loading control, membranes were stripped using ReStore ® 36 For the detection of TNFR1 (H-5) (1:500, sc-8436, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the procedure was carried out as previously describe, using HRP Goat Anti-Mouse Ig (1:2000, #554002, BD Biosciences) as the secondary antibody, except for the signal detection. In this case the chemiluminescent signal was obtained using iBright FL1500 Imaging System (ThermoFisher Scientific) with the DuoLux Chemiluminescent/Fluorescent Substrate, Peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). Membranes were re-probed with anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:10000, T6074, Sigma-Aldrich), and band intensity was quantified using the iBright Analysis Software (v 5.4.0, ThermoFisher Scientific). Data were normalized using software’s Housekeeping Protein (HKP) Normalization method with Lane Background Correction. 2.3 Cell phenotyping by flow cytometry To analyse the overall cell N-glycosylation, 1x10 5 2.4 N-glycoprofiling of cell lysates by mass spectrometry To analyse the whole N-glycoprofile, fibroblasts, stimulated and non-stimulated with TNF-α, pellets were lysed by freeze/thaw cycles, and the extracted proteins were enzymatically deglycosylated by PNGase F. Released N-glycans were isolated on Supelclean ENVI-Carb SPE columns and permethylated as previously described ( 37 The permethylated N-glycans were dissolved in 50% methanol and mixed with the matrix solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Samples were analysed in reflectron positive ion mode using UltrafleXtreme II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. All presented N-glycan structures were confirmed through MS/MS analysis (LIFT mode). Raw data were processed using FlexAnalysis v.3.4, ProteinScape v.3.0 (both from Bruker Daltonics), and GlycoWork Bench software ( 38 2.5 Quantification of secreted cytokines using ELISA and LEGENDplex™ The concentration of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-15 was determined by sandwich ELISA using commercial kits (  Supplementary Table S1 2.6 RNA extraction, sequencing, alignment and data availability Fibroblasts’ total RNA was extracted using the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma Aldrich), following the manufacturer’s instructions. NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the purity and concentration of the RNA samples. RNA integrity was analysed using the High Sensitivity RNA Analysis kit on Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc), where it was deemed acceptable if 280:260 nm and 260:230 nm ratios were higher than 1.9 and 1.5, respectively, and if the 28S:18S ratio was higher than 2.0. cDNA libraries were prepared using the QuantSeq 3’ mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD for Illumina (Lexogen, Ghmb) by the Genomics Unit of Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciências (Oeiras, Portugal).

Data normality was accessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test and comparisons of means between the four sample groups were analysed using the one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests. p-values were adjusted using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. For glycomic analysis, the relative intensities of glycan structures with unique m/z, observed in their sodiated forms, were calculated for each replicate. Normality of each protein were assessed with Shapiro-Wilk test. The statistical significance for glycan structures between groups was analysed by t-test, ANOVA and TukeyHSD post-hoc post-hoc 45 Transcriptomic analysis of TNF-α stimulated fibroblasts and non-stimulated fibroblasts (PMM2-CDG and control) was conducted using R (v.4.1.1) ( 45 46 47 48 3 Results 3.1 TNFR1 in PMM2-CDG fibroblasts upon TNF-α stimulation Skin fibroblasts from three PMM2–CDG patients (4.3 years average age) and three controls (5 years average age) were used to investigate TNFR1 expression.

For lectin staining we used lectins able to detect N-glycans expressed in TNFR1 ( 34  Figure 2A  Figure 2A Figure 2 N-glycoprofiling in stimulated and non-stimulated PMM2-CDG and control fibroblasts.

To further investigate TNFR1 signalling, we analysed the expression of key adaptor and regulatory proteins. Upon TNF-α stimulation, TRAF5, TAB2, and Fos-Like 2 (FOSL2) expression increased in control fibroblasts but not in PMM2-CDG. In contrast, TRAF2, v-rel Avian Reticuloendotheliosis Viral Oncogene Homolog A (RELA, also known as p65), and FOS expression upregulated in PMM2-CDG but remained unchanged in controls (  Figure 3C We also examined, based on DEG analysis, potential interactions between fibroblast and immune cells upon TNF-α stimulus. This analysis revealed thirty-seven genes with potential roles in influencing immune cell interactions differentially expressed (  Figure 3D  Figure 3D 3.4 TNF-α downstream signalling and cytokine expression are deregulated in PMM2-CDG fibroblasts To assess the functional consequences of TNFR1 signalling in PMM2-CDG, we analysed the expression and activation of key downstream signalling proteins and cytokine in fibroblasts stimulated with TNF-α. Western blot results indicated that TNF-α stimulation induced a significant decrease in the expression levels of both ERK1/2 and p38 in the controls (p=0.006 and p=0.02, respectively), but did not have a significant effect in PMM2-CDG fibroblasts (  Figure 4A, C  Figure 4C  Figures 4B, D  Figure 4E  Supplementary Figure S5 Figure 4 Expression of key TNFR1 signalling proteins.

Each graph compares control and PMM2-CDG groups under NS and TNF-α conditions, indicating statistical significance with asterisks. NS is shown in black bars, and TNF-α in gray bars. To evaluate the functional output of these signalling alterations, we measured cytokine secretion in response to TNF-α. In control fibroblasts, TNF-α stimulation significantly increased IL-6, CCL5, and CXCL1 secretion (p = 0.004, p = 0.002, and p = 0.024, respectively;  Figures 5A–C Figure 5 Predicted interactions between fibroblasts and immune cells based on the identified DEGs and quantification of secreted ligands.

Image created using BioRender ( www.biorender.com Proposed model of deregulated TNFR1 signalling in PMM2-CDG fibroblasts. Skin-resident fibroblasts exposed to TNF-α show impaired TNFR1 signalling due to defective N-glycosylation and reduced ectodomain shedding. This alters adaptor and regulatory protein interactions, leading to changes in downstream pathways. Downregulated proteins are indicated in red, upregulated in green, and unchanged or undetermined in yellow. Gene expression-based findings are outlined with dotted borders, protein-level findings with solid borders, and those confirmed at both levels in bold. Consequent dysregulation promotes altered inflammatory signalling, cytokine and chemokine production, apoptosis, and necroptosis, contributing to chronic inflammation in PMM2-CDG. For the first time, we report structural abnormalities in TNFR1 in PMM2-CDG fibroblasts, along with reduced cell surface expression following TNF-α stimulation (  Figure 1A 51  Figure 1B 53  Figures 1C, D 54 55 60 61 62 63 63 34 Inflammation has been associated with alterations in glycosylation, which can vary depending on the cell type and environment ( 64 66  Figure 2 67 68 34 64 Supporting the link between glycosylation and inflammatory signalling, our data revealed that fibroblasts from patients carrying the p.R141H variant exhibited a distinct transcriptional signature upon TNF-α stimulation, with altered expression of genes involved in MAPK and NF-κB pathways. This aligns with clinical observations that p.R141H is the most severe heterozygous mutation ( 49 19 69  Supplementary Figure S3B  Table 1 35 To further understand the impact of TNF-α signalling in PMM2-CDG, we analysed the DEGs following stimulation and identified three striking differences between control and PMM2-CDG fibroblasts: 1) the number of TNF-α-responsive genes; 2) exclusive genes up or downregulated in one of the groups and; 3) differential magnitudes of expression of genes that respond in both groups (  Figure 3A  Figure 3B 70 71  Figure 3C  Figure 5 72 73 74 +  Figure 3D 19 To further explore the functional basis of these gene expression defects, we examined the activation state of major TNFR1 downstream signalling proteins. PMM2-CDG fibroblasts present defective phosphorylation of p38 and JNK proteins, which aligns with the reduced cytokine expression and altered gene and transcription factors regulated by these pathways (  Figure 4 70 75 76 70 77 78 79 80 63 16 18 29 Despite the robustness of our findings, this study has some limitations. While fibroblasts are not classical immune cells and this may constrain the direct immunological relevance of our results, they are increasingly recognized as active modulators of immune response and thus provide a valuable model to investigate inflammatory mechanisms ( 81 82 83 In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that defective glycosylation in PMM2-CDG alters TNFR1 structure and signalling, leading to defective activation of key inflammatory pathways and reduced cytokine secretion. These insights not only advance our understanding of PMM2-CDG immunopathology but also identify potential therapeutic targets, such as TNFR1 modulation or glycosylation restoration strategies. This work lays the foundation for future studies exploring targeted immunotherapies in CDG and related disorders.
