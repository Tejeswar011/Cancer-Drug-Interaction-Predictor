The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between UPF consumption and the risk of mortality in an Asian population. Methods We included 62,197 middle-aged and older Chinese adults who were recruited for the Singapore Chinese Health Study from 1993 to 1998. UPFs were defined from items in the FFQ using the Nova classification, and their consumption was categorized into quintiles according to intake level. Mortality from all-cause, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, and respiratory diseases were ascertained via Linkage with a nationwide registry through 2022. Associations between UPF intake and mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results After 24.9 years (median) of follow-up, 29,472 deaths occurred. In the multivariable-adjusted model (variables related to demographics, anthropometric data, lifestyle factors, medical history, and total energy intake), compared with the lowest quintile of UPF consumption, the highest quintile was associated with higher risks of mortality from all-cause [hazard ratio (HR): 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02–1.10], CVDs (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01–1.15), and respiratory diseases (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02–1.19), but not of mortality from cancer (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.94–1.07). The associations remained essentially unchanged after further adjusting for diet quality measured using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 and antioxidant capacity using the Vitamin C Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity. Among the subgroups of UPFs, positive associations with all-cause mortality were observed for consumption of sweetened beverages (e.g. soft drinks) and sugary products (e.g. crackers and western cakes). This association was stronger in participants who were non-smokers at recruitment [respective HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03–1.13 in non-smokers versus HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.94–1.08 in smokers ( P Conclusion Higher intake of UPFs was associated with higher risks of mortality from all-cause, CVDs, and respiratory diseases in an Asian population. These results need to be confirmed in other Asian populations. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12937-025-01219-0.

Methods Study population The Singapore Chinese Health Study (SCHS) is a population-based cohort study of Chinese adults in Singapore. From 1993 to 1998, 63,257 adults aged 45–74 years were recruited; they were all permanent residents or citizens of Singapore from two major dialect groups, i.e. the Hokkien or Cantonese, who originated from the Fujian or Guangdong province in the southern part of China, respectively [ 14 15 16 Dietary assessment Habitual dietary intakes over the past 12 months were collected through a 165-item, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) by trained interviewers at baseline. The FFQ was developed specifically for this cohort and subsequently validated against two 24-h recalls within a subcohort of participants from SCHS [ 14 14 Nova food classification was applied to selected items from the FFQ, grouping food and beverage items into the following four categories according to the purpose and extent of food processing: (1) unprocessed or minimally processed foods (e.g. fruit and vegetables); (2) processed culinary ingredients (e.g. sugar and butter); (3) processed foods (e.g. canned fish); (4) UPFs (e.g. soft drinks and processed meat) [ 1 1 17 18 20 Outcome ascertainment Deaths from all-cause, CVD, cancer, and respiratory diseases were identified via Linkage with the nationwide registry of births and deaths in Singapore through December 31, 2022. Due to the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 in the Registry of Births and Deaths in Singapore, the International Classification of Diseases ninth (ICD-9, up to 31 December 2011) or tenth (ICD-10, from 2012 to 2022) revision codes were used to classify causes of death from CVD (390–459 or I00–I99), cancer (140–208, C00–C97), and respiratory diseases (460–519 or J00–J99). Covariate assessment Information on demographics (age, sex, education, and dialect group), anthropometric data (height and weight), lifestyle factors (smoking status, alcohol frequency, sleep duration, and physical activity), and medical history (hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer) were collected at baseline using a structured questionnaire. History of cancer was further ascertained via the linkage with the database of the nationwide Singapore Cancer Registry. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of the height in meters. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)−2010 score in our study was computed from 10 components of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, nuts and legumes, red meat, long-chain n–3 fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), sodium, and alcohol (trans fat not including due to very low consumption level in Singapore and lack of information on intake level in this cohort) [ 21 22 23 26 Statistical analysis Continuous variables were shown as mean ± SD or median [interquartile range (IQR)], and categorical variables were expressed as numbers (%). Follow-up time was calculated from the date of recruitment until the recorded date of death, loss to follow-up, or December 31, 2022, whichever came first. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between the weight ratio of UPFs (as sex-specific quintiles or continuous variable rescaled as per 10%) and the risk of mortality. The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models was confirmed by the Schoenfeld residuals method and inspected time-based plots. Linear trends were tested by assigning the median proportion of UPFs within each quintile to participants of that specific quintile and treating this as a continuous variable. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis with three knots (10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles) was used to examine the dose–response association between UPF intake as a continuous variable (per 1% in the weight ratio) and the risk of mortality, and the linearity was tested by Wald 𝜒 2 In Model 1, we adjusted for age (continuous, years), sex (male or female), total energy intake (continuous, kcal/d), dialect group (Cantonese or Hokkien, to account for possible genetic, dietary, and lifestyle differences between Hokkiens and Cantonese), educational level (no formal education, primary school, or secondary school or higher), body mass index (< 18.5, 18.5–22.9, 23.0-27.4, 27.5 + kg/m 2 Stratified analyses were conducted by selected factors at recruitment: age (≤ 60, > 60 y), sex (male, female), BMI (< 23, ≥ 23 kg/m 2 Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of our results. First, we excluded participants who died within 2 or 3 years or participants with history of CVD or cancer at baseline. Second, according to the standard Nova classification, we added back to UPFs whole-wheat bread and hard liquor individually or in combination and repeated our analysis. Third, we used quintiles based on the whole cohort to assess the association between UPF intake and mortality. Finally, we investigated the association between the absolute intake of UPFs (g/day) and the risk of mortality. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R software (version 4.2.3). Two-sided P Results Participant characteristics Of 62,197 participants included in our analysis, the mean age was 57.0 ± 8.0 years, and 34,719 (55.8%) were female. Participants with higher UPF intake were more likely to be non-smoking, non-drinking, and to have higher energy intake and lower scores of AHEI-2010 than those with lower UPF intake (Table 1  Table 1 Baseline characteristics according to quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption among individuals in the Singapore Chinese health study Sex-specific quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption a Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Weight ratio, Median [IQR] 1.1 (0.5–1.6) 3.3 (2.7–3.9) 6.1 (5.3-7.0) 11.0 (9.5–12.9) 20.3 (17.3–24.8) Number of subjects 12,438 (20.0) 12,440 (20.0) 12,440 (20.0) 12,440 (20.0) 12,439 (20.0) Age, years 57.2 ± 7.8 56.7 ± 7.9 56.5 ± 8.0 56.5 ± 8.0 57.9 ± 8.3 Male 5495 (44.2) 5496 (44.2) 5496 (44.2) 5496 (44.2) 5495 (44.2) Dialect group Cantonese 5803 (46.7) 5926 (47.6) 5865 (47.1) 5704 (45.9) 5573 (44.8) Hokkien 6635 (53.3) 6514 (52.4) 6575 (52.9) 6736 (54.1) 6866 (55.2) Educational level No formal education 3775 (30.4) 3402 (27.3) 3197 (25.7) 3056 (24.6) 3501 (28.1) Primary school 5757 (46.3) 5635 (45.3) 5411 (43.5) 5492 (44.1) 5356 (43.1) Secondary school or higher 2906 (23.4) 3403 (27.4) 3832 (30.8) 3892 (31.3) 3582 (28.8) Body mass index group Underweight [< 18.5 kg/m 2 698 (5.6) 761 (6.1) 777 (6.2) 848 (6.8) 914 (7.3) Normal weight [18.5 to 22.9 kg/m 2 4901 (39.4) 5121 (41.2) 5277 (42.4) 5293 (42.5) 5310 (42.7) Overweight [23.0 to 27.4 kg/m 2 5607 (45.1) 5455 (43.9) 5330 (42.8) 5275 (42.4) 5277 (42.4) Obese [≥ 27.5 kg/m 2 1232 (9.9) 1103 (8.9) 1056 (8.5) 1024 (8.2) 938 (7.5) Smoking status Never 8043 (64.7) 8436 (67.8) 8848 (71.1) 8894 (71.5) 9015 (72.5) Former 1305 (10.5) 1357 (10.9) 1380 (11.1) 1349 (10.8) 1488 (12.0) Current 3090 (24.8) 2647 (21.3) 2212 (17.8) 2197 (17.7) 1936 (15.6) Alcohol frequency None 9815 (78.9) 9981 (80.2) 10,011 (80.5) 10,089 (81.1) 10,659 (85.7) Monthly 701 (5.6) 961 (7.7) 1063 (8.6) 969 (7.8) 808 (6.5) Weekly 1123 (9.0) 1048 (8.4) 1038 (8.3) 1045 (8.4) 759 (6.1) Daily 799 (6.4) 450 (3.6) 328 (2.6) 337 (2.7) 213 (1.7) Physical activity < 0.5 h/wk 8688 (69.9) 8469 (68.1) 8255 (66.4) 8024 (64.5) 8285 (66.6) 0.5–3.9 h/wk 2213 (17.8) 2457 (19.8) 2576 (20.7) 2560 (20.6) 2466 (19.8) ≥ 4 h/wk 1537 (12.4) 1514 (12.2) 1609 (12.9) 1856 (14.9) 1688 (13.6) Sleep duration < 6 h/d 1303 (10.5) 1137 (9.1) 1061 (8.5) 1183 (9.5) 1301 (10.5) 6–8 h/d 10,257 (82.5) 10,416 (83.7) 10,585 (85.1) 10,412 (83.7) 10,239 (82.3) > 8 h/d 878 (7.1) 887 (7.1) 794 (6.4) 845 (6.8) 899 (7.2) History of hypertension 2943 (23.7) 2964 (23.8) 2875 (23.1) 2949 (23.7) 3065 (24.6) History of diabetes 1230 (9.9) 1119 (9.0) 998 (8.0) 1050 (8.4) 1176 (9.5) History of cardiovascular disease 584 (4.7) 621 (5.0) 574 (4.6) 643 (5.2) 918 (7.4) History of cancer 312 (2.5) 368 (3.0) 362 (2.9) 379 (3.0) 478 (3.8) Dietary factors Total energy intake, kcal/d 1397.6 ± 485.5 1518.4 ± 506.3 1573.0 ± 518.3 1673.8 ± 544.1 1565.0 ± 497.3 AHEI-2010 50.3 ± 7.1 50.4 ± 6.7 50.2 ± 6.9 50.0 ± 7.6 49.2 ± 8.1 VCEAC, Median [IQR] 217.8 (101.7-546.4) 228.9 (115.7-515.7) 231.9 (119.8-479.4) 250.7 (129.5-501.7) 181.5 (95.9-355.1) Values are n (%) for categorical variables and means ± standard deviations for continuous variables unless otherwise specified IQR AHEI VCEAC a Associations between UPF intake and mortality After a median follow-up of 24.9 years, 29,472 deaths occurred in this cohort, including 9,322 CVD deaths, 9,259 cancer deaths, and 6,452 respiratory disease deaths.

The associations were still significant after accounting for diet quality and antioxidant capacity. The association with all-cause mortality was significant for intake of sweetened beverages and sugary products among the subgroups of UPFs. In stratified analysis, the UPF-mortality association was stronger among non-smokers than smokers. A recently published meta-analysis included studies conducted in Western countries, comprising three in the US [ 27 29 30 31 32 33 10 34 13 13 For cause-specific mortality, our findings of an association with CVD mortality were largely consistent with studies from the UK and Italy, which also observed that higher UPF intake was associated with a higher risk of CVD mortality [ 33 35 29 30 36 36 37 37 36 35 Since higher UPF intake has been shown to be associated with reduced intake of plant-based foods, the association between UPFs and poor health could be confounded by a less healthful dietary pattern [ 38 36 38 39 36 There are several possible reasons for the association between UPF intake and mortality. First, thermal processing of foods or heat treatment could produce toxic chemicals such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in breads, cookies, and French fries. AGEs could activate downstream cell signals and form irreversible covalent complexes with proteins, and thus promote inflammation and oxidative stress [ 40 41 44 45 46 47 48 49 This study’s strengths included a large sample size, a long follow-up period, and its prospective design. Nevertheless, our study has several Limitations. First, the FFQ used in the SCHS was not specifically designed to collect dietary information according to the Nova classification; thus, we could have underestimated the measurement of UPF intake in this cohort. Second, the dietary information was only collected at baseline, and potential changes during follow-up might affect the magnitude of the results. Third, as our findings were derived from Chinese Living in Singapore, our findings may not be generalizable to other populations with vastly different compositions of UPFs in the daily diet. Fourth, given the observational design, despite comprehensive adjustment of covariates, residual confounding could not be completely ruled out. Fifth, the Nova classification is not fully objective since this food classification is not based on unequivocal, distinct physicochemical aspects of foods. Caution is needed in generalizing these findings. Finally, considering that our dietary data was collected from 1993 to 1998, more studies with more recent dietary data are needed to explore the association between UPF intake and mortality in Asian populations. Conclusion In this prospective study of Singapore Chinese adults, higher UPF intake was associated with higher risks of mortality from all-cause, CVDs, and respiratory diseases. Our findings showed that sweetened beverages (e.g. soft drinks) and sugary products (e.g. crackers and western cakes) could be major subgroups contributing to the harmful association of UPFs with mortality, and this suggests that it could be feasible and beneficial to focus on reducing the consumption of these subgroups in this Asian population. More studies are needed to identify the major harmful subgroups of UPFs in other Asian populations. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
