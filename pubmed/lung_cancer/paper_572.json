Mao Delving Into the Dialogue between Epigenetic Modifications and Immunometabolism in Cancer Advanced Genetics 6 3 2025 e00034 10.1002/ggn2.202500034 1 Introduction Tumor cells exhibit a distinct metabolic phenotype, reprogramming their glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism through multiple signaling pathways, with aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) as the most prominent metabolic feature. This metabolic adaptation not only fulfills the high energy demands of tumor cells but also modulates the function and activity of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). [  1 ] [  2 ] Epigenetics is defined as “the study of molecules and mechanisms that can perpetuate alternative gene activity states in the context of the same DNA sequence”. [  3 ] [  4 ] [  5 ] 2 Common Epigenetic Modifications Modulating Tumor Immunity Epigenetic modifications serve as a critical nexus bridging genetics, environment, and disease, playing pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes and disease progression. These modifications are heritable yet reversible, which are dynamically regulated by “writers”, “readers”, and “erasers” ( Table  1 [  3 ] Table 1 Summary of common epigenetic modifications.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Aberrant epigenetic modifications drive tumor proliferation and metastasis by regulating gene expression and immune responses. For instance, decitabine‐mediated DNA methylation inhibition reactivates silenced antitumor immune genes in advanced tumors, thereby augmenting tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes and attenuating tumor progression. [  6 ] [  7 ] [  8 ] 6 [  9 ] [  10 ] Notably, extensive crosstalk exists between epigenomic and epitranscriptomic modifications, potentially regulating the initiation and progression of diseases. The bidirectional crosstalk of chemical modification information flow between chromatin and RNA modifications substantially enhances the complexity of biological regulatory networks. [  11 ] 6 [  12 ] [  13 ] 5 [  14 ] 6 [  15 ] 3 Tumor Immunometabolism Interacts with Epigenetic Modifications to Regulate Antitumor Immunity The epigenetic plasticity and metabolic reprogramming of immune cells are core mechanisms that regulate their phenotypes and functions. Key metabolites such as acetyl‐CoA and S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM) serve as essential substrates or cofactors for epigenetic modifying enzymes, dynamically modulating epigenetic processes to precisely control immune cell activation, differentiation, and effector functions ( Figure  1 Figure 1 The role of epigenetic modifications in tumor immunometabolism. (Abbreviations: ACC1, acetyl‐CoA carboxylase‐1; α‐KG, α‐ketoglutarate; AMPK, AMP‐activated protein kinase; FAO, fatty acid oxidation; Foxp3, forkhead box protein P3; JMJD3, Jumonji domain‐containing protein 3; H3K18la, histone 3 lysine 18 lactylation; H3K27me3, histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation; H3K36me3, histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation; H3K79me2, histone 3 lysine 79 dimethylation; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1β; IL‐4, interleukin‐4; isoalloLCA, isoallolithocholic acid; [K⁺] e Metabolism‐mediated epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in macrophage activation and polarization within the tumor microenvironment. For instance, interleukin‐4‐induced tricarboxylic acid cycle activation and tumor‐derived lactate promote M2 polarization through histone acetylation and lactylation, respectively. S‐adenosylmethionine, as a key methyl donor, participates in various epigenetic processes, including histone methylation to facilitate pro‐inflammatory macrophage phenotypes. Methionine deprivation and acidosis impair methionine uptake and metabolism in T cells, reducing S‐adenosylmethionine levels and histone methylation. This can not only decrease immune‐related gene expression to weaken antitumor effects but also enhance T cell stemness and limit exhaustion to potentiate antitumor immunity. Elevated extracellular potassium concentrations enhance T cell stemness by downregulating histone acetylation at effector and exhaustion‐related gene loci. In tuberous sclerosis complex 1‐deficient dendritic cells, enhanced acetyl‐CoA carboxylase 1‐dependent lipid metabolism depletes acetyl‐CoA and reduces histone acetylation, consequently impairing CD8 + + + 3.1 Regulating the Activation and Differentiation of Immune Cells Innate immune cells exhibit functional duality in the TME, mediating both antitumor immunity and tumor‐induced immunosuppression. These divergent outcomes can be orchestrated through coupled metabolic‐epigenetic control of their activation states. Tuberous sclerosis complex gene 1 (TSC1)‐deficient dendritic cells exhibit enhanced fatty acid synthesis, which exerts dual effects. Lipid accumulation impairs antigen cross‐presentation, while cytosolic acetyl‐CoA depletion reduces histone acetylation, subsequently downregulating major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC‐I) and IL‐7 expression. This metabolic‐epigenetic dysregulation ultimately compromises CD8⁺ T cell activation. [  16 ] [  17 ] The metabolic–epigenetic regulatory axis also shapes immune cell differentiation, most notably influencing macrophages within the TME. Lipopolysaccharide‐stimulated macrophages upregulate the methionine cycle, elevating SAM levels and sustaining a high SAM:S‐adenosine homocysteine (SAH) ratio. This promotes a pro‐inflammatory macrophage phenotype by enhancing H3K36me3‐dependent inflammatory gene expression (e.g., IL‐1β). [  18 ] [  19 ] [  20 ] 6 STAT1 [  21 ] Adaptive immune cells are pivotal components of the tumor immune microenvironment, where their differentiation and activity determine the direction of immune responses, intricately orchestrated by the interplay between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications. Cell‐permeable α‐KG significantly enhances oxidative phosphorylation activity and promotes forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) gene methylation, inhibiting Foxp3 + [  22 ] [  23 ] 6 [  24 ] In summary, both innate and adaptive immune cells within the TME undergo profound metabolic reprogramming or are modulated by extracellular factors, leading to altered metabolite levels. These changes subsequently regulate immune cell activation and differentiation through epigenetic modifications. Current studies have predominantly focused on macrophage polarization, while studies on other immune cell types remain limited and warrant further investigation. 3.2 Modulating the Effector Function and Exhaustion of Immune Cells When innate immune cells are initially exposed to pathogens or endogenous stimuli, they acquire enhanced responsiveness to secondary challenges through epigenetic modifications (e.g., histone methylation) and metabolic reprogramming (e.g., glycolysis, glutamine metabolism). This phenomenon is termed “trained immunity”. [  25 ] [  26 ] 6 programmed death‐ligand 1 [  27 ] Current research on immunometabolism‐epigenetic modifications crosstalk primarily focuses on its regulatory effects in T cells. Tumor cells outcompete CD8 + [  28 ] + [  29 ] [  30 ] 6 [  31 ] Chronic antigen stimulation induces T cell exhaustion, characterized by diminished proliferative capacity, elevated inhibitory receptor expression, metabolic insufficiency, epigenetic alterations, and dysfunction. The acidic tumor microenvironment impairs methionine uptake and metabolism in T cells by downregulating methionine transporters, which alters H3K27me3 deposition at stemness‐associated gene promoters. This epigenetic reprogramming promotes the acquisition and maintenance of T cell stemness while limiting exhaustion. [  32 ] [  33 ] [  10 ] Thus, tumor cell‐driven nutrient deprivation and the acidic TME collectively shape a distinct immunometabolic landscape. Current research has primarily elucidated how the metabolism‐epigenetics axis regulates T cell function, particularly metabolic competition‐induced epigenetic dysregulation driving T cell exhaustion or stem‐like properties. Notably, while metabolic and epigenetic alterations in immune cells may attenuate antitumor responses, they could also be leveraged to improve immune cell fitness and functionality. However, research in this area remains limited, especially regarding non‐T immune cells and RNA modifications. Furthermore, given the emerging paradigm of crosstalk between epigenomic and RNA modifications in reshaping tumor epigenetics, deeper investigations into their interplay with immunometabolic pathways are warranted. 4 Emerging Technologies for Elucidating the Crosstalk Between Epigenetic Modifications and Immunometabolism While research on the crosstalk between tumor immunometabolism and epigenomic modifications remains in its infancy, its translational significance is becoming increasingly evident. Heterogeneous tumor cell subpopulations, diverse infiltrating immune cells (e.g., myeloid cells, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes), and non‐cellular components collectively constitute the TME. These cellular elements exhibit uneven spatial distribution and undergo dynamic alterations during tumor progression, resulting in both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. This complexity presents significant challenges for deciphering the tumor immune microenvironment. While established techniques, including metabolomics, extracellular flux analysis, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening, have been widely employed in immunometabolism research, their inherent limitations remain non‐negligible. [  34 ] [  34 ] Figure  2 Figure 2 Novel technologies reveal epigenetic modification‐immunometabolic crosstalk in cancer. (Abbreviations: 5mC, 5‐methylcytosine; m 6 The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic ecosystem comprising tumor cells, immune cells, stromal components, and extracellular factors. Its spatiotemporal heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Metabolic reprogramming and intercellular communication collaboratively shape a tumor microenvironment characterized by hypoxia, acidosis, and accumulated reactive oxygen species. Notably, the crosstalk between immunometabolism and epigenetic modifications profoundly influences the activation, differentiation, and functional properties of immune cells. Emerging single‐cell sequencing technologies, spatial omics, and artificial intelligence empower the exploration of this field. Different technologies possess distinct advantages and characteristics, and their integrated application achieves complementary functionality. Thus, the integration of multi‐omics technology and artificial intelligence will provide a broader avenue for investigating the interplay between tumor immunometabolism and epigenetic modifications. 4.1 Single‐Cell Sequencing Single‐cell sequencing technology overcomes the limitations of conventional next‐generation sequencing in analyzing cell‐specific information within highly heterogeneous cellular populations through single‐cell isolation, screening, and population identification at the single‐cell resolution. This approach has been extensively applied in tumor heterogeneity and tumor immune microenvironment research. [  35 ] [  35 ] scRNA‐seq enables high‐resolution gene expression profiling of numerous individual cells simultaneously, allowing comprehensive assessment of diverse cell types, functional states, and subpopulations within heterogeneous cell populations. This powerful approach facilitates the identification of rare and novel cell subtypes, while providing unique insights into intercellular communication within the TME and the evolutionary dynamics of tumorigenesis. [  36 ] [  37 ] [  38 ] scATAC‐seq serves as a powerful tool for deciphering dynamic chromatin landscapes and gene expression regulation by sequencing DNA fragments from accessible chromatin regions, enabling single‐cell resolution analysis of chromatin accessibility to delineate transcriptional and epigenetic alterations. [  39 ] [  40 ] Intriguingly, the integrated application of scATAC‐seq and scRNA‐seq enables simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in single cells. This multi‐omics approach facilitates direct linkage between regulatory elements and their target genes, identification of key transcription factors driving cell state transitions, and ultimately the construction of a more comprehensive gene regulatory atlas. The application of longitudinal scRNA‐seq and scATAC‐seq analyses enables the investigation of distinct transcriptional and epigenetic changes underlying T cell developmental trajectories, as well as the degree of heterogeneity within diverse T cell populations. [  41 ] [  36 ] 4.2 Spatial Omics The advent of spatial omics has revolutionized cancer research paradigms by providing unprecedented insights into the spatial architecture and molecular characteristics of distinct cellular populations within tumors. This groundbreaking advancement enables the construction of comprehensive “spatial maps” of malignancies, facilitating in‐depth exploration of the intricate spatial relationships and cellular interactions within the TME, thereby offering novel insights into tumor heterogeneity and progression mechanisms. [  42 ] Spatial metabolomics integrates mass spectrometry imaging with metabolomics to qualitatively, quantitatively, and spatially analyze metabolic distributions and heterogeneity across tissues. This approach is increasingly utilized to uncover cancer‐associated metabolic reprogramming and identify potential biomarkers. [  43 ] [  44 ] Despite limitations in resolution, sensitivity, and reproducibility, ongoing technological innovations and the integration of multi‐omics approaches are progressively overcoming these challenges. [  43  44 ] [  45 ] [  46 ] [  47 ] While current research has yet to fully utilize these technologies to explore the interplay between tumor immunometabolism and epigenetic regulation, single‐cell sequencing and spatial omics offer remarkable potential for this field. Through delineating the region‐specific distribution of metabolites and the spatial expression patterns of epigenetic modifiers and their target genes, the integration of single‐cell sequencing and spatial omics promises to elucidate how immunometabolic reprogramming governs local immune responses through epigenetic mechanisms in tumors. 4.3 Artificial Intelligence The development of machine learning models significantly enhances the capability to extract critical biological information from complex cancer datasets, providing robust support for cancer subtype prediction, disease progression modeling, tumor biomarker discovery, and early clinical diagnosis. [  43 ] [  48 ] [  49 ] [  44 ] 5 Concluding Remarks Tumor immunometabolism and epigenetic modifications are interconnected through a sophisticated regulatory network, wherein their bidirectional crosstalk reshapes the TME through multiple mechanisms. Tumor cells alter immune cell metabolism by competing for nutrients and secreting metabolic byproducts, thereby functionally reprogramming immune responses. Metabolic intermediates generated during immune cell metabolic reprogramming serve as epigenetic modulators that regulate the expression of immune‐related genes, ultimately controlling immune cell activation, differentiation, and functional states. Concurrently, alterations in epigenetic modifier activity may reciprocally influence metabolic pathways. For instance, lactate‐induced histone lactylation modulates m 6 6 [  20  31 ] Nevertheless, several critical questions remain unresolved. Currently, most studies remain focused on correlative observations, failing to elucidate how specific metabolic pathways directly drive epigenetic alterations in immune cells or identify the key signaling pathways mediating this crosstalk to regulate immune cell activity and function. Resolving these questions necessitates precise experimental designs and dynamic monitoring to establish definitive mechanistic causal links. In addition, future investigations should broaden their scope to encompass more non‐T immune cell populations, as well as RNA modifications. Given the growing recognition of the crosstalk between epigenomic and epitranscriptomic modifications in tumors, their coordinated regulatory mechanisms and functional roles in tumor immunometabolism hold substantial scientific value and warrant further investigation. Owing to the pronounced heterogeneity of tumors, the immunometabolism–epigenetic regulatory axis may vary significantly across tumor types and even among subtypes of the same tumor. This complicates systematic elucidation of its underlying mechanisms, yet also suggests that specific immunometabolic products or epigenetic regulators may hold potential as biomarkers for tumor diagnosis. Moreover, targeting the metabolic–epigenetic axis has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, whereas the potential off‐target effects and resistance associated with epigenetic drugs remain major challenges. [  50 ] [  51 ] In recent years, multi‐omics integration has emerged as a cornerstone approach for deciphering TME complexity. The synergistic application of single‐cell sequencing and spatial omics has driven groundbreaking advances in tumor immunometabolism and epigenetic regulation. Single‐cell technologies resolve transcriptional profiles and chromatin accessibility at single‐cell resolution, whereas spatial omics preserve crucial spatial context, enabling comprehensive characterization of metabolic heterogeneity and immune cell spatial interactions. Through multi‐omics integration, researchers have identified immune cell subsets with distinct metabolic‐epigenetic features and elucidated their metabolic reprogramming mechanisms and immunoregulatory functions within the TME. This high‐resolution, multi‐dimensional paradigm provides a transformative framework for investigating the immunometabolic‐epigenetic crosstalk in cancer. Furthermore, artificial intelligence demonstrates unique capabilities in decoding the interplay between tumor immunometabolism and epigenetic regulation by integrating high‐dimensional multi‐omics data and uncovering pivotal biological mechanisms within complex datasets.
