It is secreted by necrotic and apoptotic cells and functions as a potent inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, thereby bridging innate and adaptive immune responses ( 1 2 While the role of HMGB1 in innate immune cells has been extensively studied, its function in B cells remains poorly understood. Recent studies have shed light on the interaction between HMGB1 and its receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE is expressed in peripheral B cells; however, its deficiency does not impair B cell development or activation following IgM and Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation ( 3 3 4 5 6 HMGB family proteins are known to interact with various transcription factors to modulate gene expression. For instance, HMGB2 binds to the LEF1 β-catenin complex, enhancing the expression of genes containing LEF1-binding sites ( 7 8 9 lo 10 Cd21 Cd21 11 Cd21 12 Actin dynamics are critical for B cell receptor (BCR) clustering and signalosome assembly. HMGB1 also plays a role in cytoskeletal dynamics by inducing actin reorganization in various cell types ( 13 14 HMGB1 15 Here, we identify HMGB1 as a critical regulator of peripheral B cell compartmentalization and activation thresholds. Using conditional Hmgb1 Lef1 Cd21 Results HMGB1 is essential for differentiation of peripheral B cells and B1 cells, not for development of bone marrow B cells.

HMGB1 is involved in BCR activation and downregulates the proximal BCR signaling. B cell differentiation is primarily governed by B cell activation and BCR signaling. To assess whether HMGB1 is involved in BCR activation, we examined the spatiotemporal relationship between BCR and HMGB1 using confocal microscopy. Notably, this colocalization was markedly elevated at 5, 10, and 30 minutes poststimulation compared with the resting state ( Figure 2, A and B Figure 2C 12 21 24 Figure 2, D–F Figure 2, G–I Figure 2, J and K Figure 2L HMGB1 has been shown to play a role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in other cell types. Additionally, transcriptional data also suggested alterations in mTOR signaling in cKO B cells ( Figure 2C Figure 3A Figure 3B Given the close relationship between mTOR activity and cellular metabolism, we assessed the impact of Hmgb1 Figure 3, C and D Figure 3E Figure 3, F and G Figure 3H Figure 3, H and K Hmgb1 25 Figure 3, I and J Figure 3K Hmgb1 deficiency positively regulates the activation of NF-κB signaling. NF-κB, a signaling intermediate located distally in both BCR and TLR4 pathways, has been demonstrated to be hyperactive in other models of autoimmunity ( 26 Hmgb1 Figure 4, A, B, E, F, I, and J Figure 4, C, D, G, and H Figure 4, M and N Figure 4K Figure 4L Figure 4N Hmgb1 deficiency enhances the accumulation of F-actin via the MST1/DOCK8/WASP axis. Besides the signaling pathways we addressed above, we also observed that cKO B cells developed an abnormal regulation of actin cytoskeleton based on our RNA-Seq data ( Figure 2C 27 28 Hmgb1 Figure 5, A–D Figure 5E Figure 5E To further explore the upstream regulators of WASP activation, we examined the expression of DOCK8 and WASP-interacting protein (WIP; a scaffolding protein that stabilizes WASP and promotes its activation in actin cytoskeleton signaling), as well as MST1, which influences DOCK8 activity, in WT and cKO B cells following anti-BCR stimulation. The levels of DOCK8, WIP, MST1, and p-MST1 were all elevated in cKO B cells ( Figure 5F Figure 5G Mst1 Dock8 Wip Wip Dock8 Mst1 Figure 5H Figure 5, I and J Hmgb1 deficiency enhances B cell spreading, BCR clustering, and BCR signalosome recruitment in response to membrane antigens. To investigate the impact of Hmgb1 Figure 6, A–C Figure 6, D–I Figure 6, J–M Hmgb1 HMGB1 is indispensable for T-independent and T-dependent humoral immune responses. Innate-like B cells, such as MZ and B1 B cells, serve as frontline defenders in humoral immunity, enabling rapid containment of T-independent (TI) pathogens and priming adaptive immune pathways for sustained protection. Having seen the significant changes of MZ and B1a B cell populations in cKO mice ( Figure 1, K and P Figure 7, A and B Figure 7C Figure 7, D–G Supplemental Figure 2 Figure 7H To assess HMGB1’s role in TD immunity, mice were immunized with NP-KLH. After primary immunization, cKO mice showed elevated MZ B cells ( Supplemental Figure 3 Supplemental Figure 3 Supplemental Figure 3K Supplemental Figure 3 Supplemental Figure 3 Figure 7, I–L Figure 7, M–O Supplemental Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 4G Previous studies have implicated HMGB1 in regulating the expressions or functions of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), CD40, and MHC-II ( 21 29 30 Supplemental Figure 4H Supplemental Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 4K Figure 4, C and M Supplemental Figure 4K Collectively, these results indicate that HMGB1 is necessary for effective humoral immune responses induced by both TD and TI antigens. HMGB1 interacts with LEF1 to negatively regulate Cd21 expression, potentially suppressing B cell activation. To investigate the potential molecular mechanism by which HMGB1 regulates BCR signal transduction, we assessed expressions of key BCR coreceptors, CD21 and CD19, which lower the activation threshold of BCR. Strikingly, CD21 surface expression was significantly elevated in cKO mice across B220 + Figure 8, A–F + Supplemental Figure 5 Cd21 Figure 8G To test whether HMGB1 directly suppresses Cd21 Cd21 Hmgb1 Cd21 Figure 8H Cd21 Building on our prior discovery that LEF1 can repress Cd21 11 Figure 8, I and J Figure 8, K and L Lef1 Figure 8, M and N Cd21 Cd21 Discussion The dual role of HMGB1 as a nuclear DNA chaperone and extracellular DAMP has been extensively studied in innate immunity, yet its intrinsic functions in B cells remained enigmatic. Here we first unveil HMGB1 as a critical rheostat of peripheral B cell homeostasis and activation, operating through integrated transcriptional and cytoskeletal mechanisms. The expansion of MZ B cells and loss of B1a cells in Hmgb1 31 32 Cd21 Lef1 Additionally, HMGB1 binds to BCR signalosomes, and the kinetics of its correlation with BCR closely resemble those of distal BCR signaling molecules, such as p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-JNK ( 33 Hmgb1 Hmgb1 Beyond transcriptional regulation, HMGB1 emerges as a modulator of actin dynamics in B cells. The hyperactivation of the MST1/DOCK8/WASP axis in cKO B cells, leading to enhanced F-actin polymerization and BCR clustering, reveals a cytoskeletal role for HMGB1. This is distinct from its reported effects in non-B cells, where HMGB1 regulates actin via moesin phosphorylation or PKA/N-WASP pathways ( 14 15 Hmgb1 The defective antibody responses in cKO mice following both TI and TD immunizations reveal context-specific roles for HMGB1 in B cell function. The impaired TI immunity despite MZ B cell expansion suggests Hmgb1 32 34 35 36 The dual mechanisms uncovered here, transcriptional and cytoskeletal, position HMGB1 as a multimodal regulator of B cell function. Its interaction with LEF1 parallels HMGB1’s ability to bend DNA and facilitate transcription factor binding, as seen with NF-κB in innate immune cells. Similarly, its cytoskeletal role via MST1/DOCK8/WASP expands upon HMGB1’s known capacity to modulate cell migration in cancer and endothelial cells ( 37 38 Hmgb1 In conclusion, our study redefines HMGB1 as a guardian of B cell homeostasis, integrating nuclear and cytoplasmic pathways to modulate activation thresholds. By bridging transcriptional control and cytoskeletal dynamics, HMGB1 ensures that B cells remain poised for defense without tipping into autoimmunity, a delicate equilibrium essential for immune health. Methods Sex as a biological variable. Male and female mice aged 6–8 weeks were used in a 1:1 ratio. Sex was not considered as a biological variable in these analyses. Mice and cells. Hmgb1 Cd19 Hmgb1 fl/fl Splenic lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll-Paque Premium (17-5446-02; GE Healthcare, now Cytiva).

For the immunization experiment, PE-anti-NP (N-5070-1; Biosearch Technologies), BV421-anti-IgD, and BV510-anti-CD138 (142521; BioLegend) were used for staining to assess PC, PBC, and MBC subsets. Cells were incubated at 4°C and detected with Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed with FlowJo V10 (Tree Star) software. Immunofluorescence. Mice’s kidneys were cross-sectioned and the largest cross sections were embedded in OCT (4583; Sakura Finetek) and frozen in liquid nitrogen to prepare frozen sections. Sections were blocked and stained with Cy3-AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG (715-165-151; Jackson ImmunoResearch), imaged using a confocal microscope (LSM 780; Zeiss), and finally analyzed using the ZEN 2.3 software. To identify B cells and the MZ region, spleen sections were stained with Rat anti-Mouse CD169 (MCA947GA; Bio-Rad), followed by Goat anti-Rat IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 (A-11006; Thermo Fisher Scientific), to visualize the MZ; after 2 washes, spleen sections were stained with APC-anti-B220 (553092; BD Pharmingen) to demonstrate the B cells. Images were captured via the Nikon confocal microscope and analyzed using NIS-Elements AR 3.2 software. Confocal analysis. For confocal analysis, purified splenic B cells were immobilized on glass slides coated with poly- l 2 R37110 Western blotting.

Purified B cells (5 × 10 6 Hmgb1 Cd21 Lef1 ChIP assay. ChIP experiments were conducted based on the manufacturer’s protocol by using the SimpleChIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Agarose Beads) (9002S; CST). Purified B cells from WT mice were transferred into formaldehyde for 10 minutes, and then ultrasound was used on the lysate to shear cross-linked chromatin into lengths ranging from 100 to 1,000 base pairs. Solubilized chromatin was immunoprecipitated using anti-HMGB1, and PCR assay was conducted on a Bio-Rad PCR instrument. ChIP DNA was quantified using a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Allied Biosystems) instrument. The free and purified DNA was normalized to the input material used for the ChIP reaction. Sequences of the primer sets used for PCR and quantitative RT-PCR are as follows: Mst1 WIP Dock8 Lef1 RNA extraction and RNA-Seq analysis. For RNA preparation, Biotin Mouse B Lymphocyte Enrichment Cocktail (51-9001846; BD Biosciences) and Streptavidin Particles Plus–DM (51-9000810; BD Biosciences) of Mouse B Lymphocyte Enrichment Set-DM Kit (557792; BD Biosciences) were used to obtained purified B lymphocytes from splenic lymphocytes of WT and cKO mice according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were treated with TRIzol reagent (15596026; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for RNA extraction and then sequenced using the BGIseq-500 system (BGI). PolyA tail mRNA was enriched with magnetic beads containing Oligodt. The RNA obtained was fragmented using a disruption buffer, followed by reverse transcription with random N6 primers; subsequently, the 2 cDNA strands were synthesized to form double-stranded DNA. The ends of the synthesized double-stranded DNA were blunted, and their 5′-ends were phosphorylated. Ligation products were then amplified via PCR with specific primers. After the PCR product was thermally denatured into single strands, these single-stranded DNAs were cycled using a bridging primer to generate a single-stranded circular DNA library.
