Small duct iCCAs occur preferentially in the periphery of the liver and are histologically characterized by small ductal pattern composed of cuboidal or low columnar neoplastic cells. Large duct iCCAs typically occur near the hepatic hilar region and are composed of columnar glandular cells growing in a tubular pattern with occasional mucin production. For the precursor lesion of iCCA, biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN) and intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) are the precursors of large duct iCCA, whereas no definite precursor lesion has been identified for small duct iCCA [ 1 The patient was a 70‐year‐old man who presented with a liver mass measuring 50 mm in diameter on imaging. The laboratory tests were negative for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Liver transaminases, gamma‐glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin were all within normal limits. The serum levels of alpha‐fetoprotein and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA‐II) were within normal limits. The patient had a history of hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with lung metastasis 10 years before hepatectomy; based on this, the liver mass was clinically evaluated as a metastasis of prior hypopharyngeal cancer, and the patient underwent radiofrequency ablation followed by partial hepatectomy. The patient had a history of alcohol consumption (60 g per day for 40 years) and tobacco smoking (20 cigarettes per day for 40 years). No risk factors for iCCA, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, liver stone disease, or liver fluke infection, were noted. The patient received chemotherapy with cisplatin, 5‐fluorouracil, cetuximab, and nivolumab for hypopharyngeal cancer until 3 years before hepatectomy. Gross examination of the hepatectomy specimen revealed two separate solid nodules, one measuring 50 mm and the other measuring 5 mm in the largest diameter, both of which were located at the periphery of the liver (Figure 1a S1 1a,b 1c,d 1e,f S2a,b S2c,d Figure 1 (a) Gross examination of the hepatectomy specimen revealed a large solid mass measuring 50 mm in diameter, in which a necrotic area due to prior radiofrequency ablation therapy was observed. A small nodule, which was not identified by imaging, was incidentally discovered in the subcapsular area during the gross examination (arrow). Scale bar, 10 mm. (b–f) Histology of the small biliary tumor. A well‐circumscribed nodule measuring 5 mm in diameter was composed of two distinct areas (b, scale bar, 1 mm). The peripheral component was composed of bland‐looking small glands with cuboidal to flat ductal cells, reminiscent of BDA (c, d). The central component was composed of glands exhibiting intraepithelial growth, such as a cribriform or solid‒papillary pattern (e, f). Mild cytologic atypia was observed (f). To investigate the clonal relatedness of large and small tumors, we conducted whole‐exome sequencing (WES) for both lesions (Table S1 BAP1 KRAS BAP1 CDKN2A S3 FGFR2 FGFR2 Although the small biliary tumor could be diagnosed as an early iCCA, we questioned whether the nodule might be a preinvasive form of iCCA of the small duct type. This is based on the following observations: (1) the lesion is small and well circumscribed, with no findings indicative of invasiveness (i.e., a replacement growth pattern at the tumor‒liver interface); (2) the nodule has a bland‐looking component with a low proliferative index at the periphery of the nodule, the histology of which is suggestive of bile duct adenoma (BDA); and (3) no desmoplastic stromal reaction or lymphovascular invasion is observed. Bile duct adenoma (BDA) is a benign, small bile duct lesion of the liver with a median diameter of 3–6 mm. Although BDA has been considered a reactive process to focal injury or hepatitis, or a hamartomatous lesion (peribiliary gland hamartoma), a recent study revealed the BRAF 2 3 4 5 1 Alternatively, the small nodule may be diagnosed as a small duct iCCA with innocuous‐looking, BDA‐like features [ 6 The patient had two independent biliary tumors simultaneously, suggesting that one or more risk factors may affect the formation of these tumors. The background liver parenchyma was intact despite the patient being a heavy drinker and smoker. The patient did not have any known risk factors for iCCA. Notably, however, mutational signature analysis revealed that prior platinum‐based chemotherapy may have affected the formation of both tumors. Indeed, this patient underwent platinum‐based chemotherapy for hypopharyngeal cancer 10 years before hepatectomy. However, it is uncertain whether platinum‐based chemotherapy played a role in the initiation or progression of a pre‐existing lesion of these tumors. Unfortunately, we could not perform WES on the two components of the small biliary nodule separately due to the limited amount of tissue available. The comparison of genetic make‐up between the two components might have provided insight into the stepwise progression of this small tumor. In closing, we presented a small‐sized biliary tumor that may be a preinvasive iCCA of small duct type. Further studies of small‐sized iCCAs of small duct type are needed to better define the potential high‐grade precursor of small duct iCCA.
