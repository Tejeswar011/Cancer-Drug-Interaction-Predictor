Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) has generated interest as a potential target for therapy due to it being involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of HAT1 in OC has not yet been investigated. In the present study, HAT1 was upregulated in OC and the high expression of HAT1 was associated with unfavorable prognosis. The transcription factor forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) transcriptionally regulated HAT1 expression. Furthermore, HAT1 knockdown in OC cells significantly suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation. In addition, the inhibition of HAT1 promoted cell cycle arrest, and reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, CDK4 and cyclin E levels in OC cells. Taken together, the present data suggested that HAT1 served an oncogenic role in OC; therefore, HAT1 may represents a new potential therapeutic target in OC treatment. ovarian cancer histone acetyltransferase 1 forkhead box protein A1 cell cycle tumor growth Science and Technology Research Project of Henan province LHGJ20220532 The present work was supported by the Science and Technology Research Project of Henan province (grant no.

Overexpression or inappropriate recruitment of HATs have been associated with the development and progression of malignant tumors ( 6 7 8 11 12 13 To date, to the best of our knowledge, the role and function of HAT1 in OC have not been investigated. The present study aimed to elucidate the HAT1 expression levels in specimens from patients with OC and healthy human samples. Then the molecular mechanism of upstream regulator of HAT1 will be studied, as well as the function of HAT1 in regulating OC cell proliferation and colony formation activities. Furthermore, the role of HAT1 in regulation of cell cycle pathway in OC cells will be analyzed, and whether knockdown of HAT1 could decrease cell cycle-related protein expression levels in OC cells. Thus, the present results may contribute to a better understanding of the potential role of HAT1 in OC, which could provide new biomarkers for novel therapeutic strategies in OC. Materials and methods Cell culture and reagents Human OC cell lines OVCAR3, HEY, A2780 and SKOV3, and the immortalized ovarian epithelial cell line IOSE386 were grown in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS (both Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The cells were cultured in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO 2 6 6 ® Western blot analysis Lysates from whole cells (IOSE386, OVCAR3, HEY, A2780 and SKOV3) were extracted using RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with a protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell suspensions were homogenized and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to extract the supernatant. Equal amounts of protein (15 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (Upper layer 4% stacking gel and lower layer 8% separating gel) and transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membrane was treated with the indicated primary antibodies at 4°C overnight and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000; Cat.31430, Cat.31460; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) for another 2 h at room temperature. Signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent from Pierce (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and analyzed with a ImageQuant LAS 4000 and ImageQuant TL 8.1 software (GE Healthcare). The following primary antibodies were used in the present study: Anti-HAT1 (1:1,000; cat no. 11432-1-AP; Proteintech Group, Inc.), anti-CDK2 (1:1,000; cat no. 10122-1-AP; Proteintech Group, Inc.), anti-FOXA1 (1:1,000; cat no. 20411-1-AP; Proteintech Group, Inc.), anti-CDK4 (1:1,000; cat no. 12790; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-cyclin E (1:1,000; cat no. 20808; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and anti-GAPDH (1:5,000; cat no. 60004-1-Ig; Proteintech Group, Inc.). RNA isolation and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qPCR) TRIzol ® ™ −ΔΔCq 14 Colony formation assay 500 Cells (HEY and SKOV3 cells) were trypsinized, assessed and cultivated for 2 weeks in medium containing 10% FBS. Subsequently, the cells were washed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stained with 1% crystal violet for 30 min at 37°C. The colonies visible at the plates were counted with ImageJ software v1.41 (National Institutes of Health) and images were captured. Cell viability assay 2000 HEY and SKOV3 cells were trypsinized, measured and seeded into 96-well plates with medium containing 10% FBS. Each well received 10 µl Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) solution (Dojindo Laboratories, Inc.) and the cells were cultured in an incubator at 37°C for 1 h. At various time points (24, 48, 72, 96, 120 h), the absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader and analyzed (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Cell cycle assay A total of 5×10 6 EdU staining The EdU reagent was used to measure cell proliferation (Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd.). A total of 2×10 4 Cell survival assay HEY and SKOV3 cells were seeded into 96-well plates (5×10 3 Luciferase reporter assay The potential transcriptional factor FOXA1 binding sites of the HAT1 promoter region were analyzed through the UCSC Genome Browser (genome.ucsc.edu/) and TF database JASPAR ( https://jaspar.elixir.no/ ® Renilla Renilla Bioinformatics analysis The HAT1 protein expression data from healthy human tissue and OC tissues was derived from antibody-based protein profiling using immunohistochemistry from the Human Protein Atlas database ( https://www.proteinatlas.org/ https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga tnmplot.com/analysis/ ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/contributed-genomic-data-cancer-research/clinical-proteomic-tumor-analysis-consortium-cptac kmplot.com/analysis/ http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp linkedomics.org cistrome.org/db/#/ cbioportal.org/ https://www.cbioportal.org/ Statistical analysis Experiments were repeated at least three times and data are presented as the mean ± SD, with results analyzed using GraphPad 8.0 software (Dotmatics). The differences between two groups were analyzed via unpaired Student's t-test. HAT1 expression levels between the OC cell lines and the normal IOSE386 cell line were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's post hoc test. The significance of differences in HAT1 expression in the bioinformatics analysis was determined using Welch's t-test, or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Results Expression levels of HAT1 are upregulated in OC tissues and higher HAT1 levels indicate poor prognosis HAT1 was the first HAT) discovered; however, its biological functions together with the cell mechanisms involved in cancer progression are poorly characterized. To identify the potential role of HAT1 in OC, the immunohistochemistry staining results of HAT1 in OC tissue were analyzed in the Human Protein Atlas database, and HAT1 staining was found to be higher in OC compared with in healthy human specimens ( Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Fig. 1C Fig. 1D Fig. 1E HAT1 levels are increased in OC cell lines To determine the role of HAT1 in OC development, the mRNA expression levels of HAT1 were assessed in different OC cell lines: A2780, HEY, OVCAR3 and SKOV3. The results showed that HAT1 expression levels were generally upregulated in OC cell lines compared with normal IOSE386 cell line, especially in HEY and SKOV3 cells, which were used in subsequent study ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2B FOXA1 transcriptionally regulates HAT1 expression in OC TFs are important for the modulation of various signaling pathways associated with cell homeostasis and disease conditions ( 15 Fig. 3A Fig. 3A Fig. 3B and C Fig. 3D Fig. 3E Fig. 3F Fig. 3G HAT1 is involved in DNA replication and pyrimidine metabolism pathways To explore the regulatory pathways associated with HAT1 expression levels, OC data from TCGA database were downloaded and analyzed, before being separated into HAT1 high- and low-expression groups section. The LinkedOmics database suggested that differentially expressed genes of HAT1 were enriched in several biological processes, such as ‘DNA replication’, ‘pyrimidine metabolism’ and ‘RNA transport’ ( Fig. 4A Fig. 4B Fig. 4C Fig. 4D HAT1 induces OC cell viability and colony formation To confirm the tumor-promoting role of HAT1, HEY and SKOV3 OC cell lines were used to knockdown HAT1 expression ( Fig. 5A Fig. 5B Fig. 5C Fig. 5D HAT1 expression is associated with CDK2, CDK4 and cyclin E levels Human HEY OC cells were transfected with negative control and HAT1 siRNAs. These cells were then stained with an EdU probe, which functions as a cell proliferation marker, and the results showed that HAT1 knockdown significantly suppressed EdU activities ( Fig. 6A 16 Fig. 6B Fig. 6C Fig. 6D Discussion OC has become one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in female patients worldwide, with an expected 313,000 cases and 207,000 mortalities in 2020, ranking as the third highest cause of death among gynecological cancers ( 17 18 19 16 20 21 13 22 23 13 22 23 FOXA1 belongs to the FOXA TF family and has a forkhead (or winged helix) DNA-binding domain of ~100 amino acids. FOXA1 functions as a TF and attaches to the chromosome to induce nucleosome remodeling, which allows other TFs to bind to the chromosome and perform tissue-specific transcriptional programs ( 24 28 29 29 + 30 31 The functional importance of HAT1 has been investigated in a number of cell models to improve understanding of its biological function. Previous investigation has suggested that HAT1 is briefly localized on chromatin, adjacent to DNA replication sites, where it plays a regulatory role in replication fork stalling ( 32 33 34 In the present study, the expression levels of HAT1 were positively correlated with PCNA in the DNA replication pathway. PCNA is the eukaryotic DNA sliding clamp that interacts with cell cycle proteins, including cyclins and CDKs, involved in DNA replication ( 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Notably, findings have revealed the importance of HAT1 in a variety of physiological processes, encouraging additional research to determine its biological function ( 12 42 12 42 43 Acknowledgements Not applicable.
