This study investigated the effect of TNAP on liver fibrosis and its mechanism in regulating TGF-β1 signaling. Methods: Human liver samples and a CCl 4 Results: Elevated TNAP expression was observed in human and murine fibrotic liver tissues, correlating with increased fibrotic markers. In vivo experiments using TNAP overexpression and inhibition in a CCl 4 Conclusions: TNAP plays a critical regulatory role in TGF-β1-mediated liver fibrosis, probably by promoting the binding of CD47/TSP1.

The accumulation of myofibroblasts (MFBs) is central to fibrogenesis, contributing to the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components. 1 – 3  4  5  6 Liver tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), encoded by the ALPL 7 – 9  10  11  12 Following liver injury, quiescent HSCs respond rapidly by upregulating TGF-β1, which initially exists as a latent precursor. This precursor binds to the N-terminus of the latency-associated peptide (LAP) to form the LAP–TGF-β1 complex. 13 , 14  15 This study aimed to elucidate the potential involvement of TNAP in the progression of liver fibrosis, and sought to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for the management of liver fibrosis. METHODS Human liver samples Fresh liver samples of non-fibrotic (liver biopsy during bariatric surgery, n=3) and cirrhotic livers (post-cirrhotic cancer resection, n=3) were obtained during surgical procedures, being frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after removal and then transferred to −80 °C for preservation, and were used for western blot (WB) and PCR assays. All subjects provided written informed consent before surgery. Paraffin-embedded liver specimens from liver carcinoma surgery (n=20) were obtained by writing the application to the sample bank of the pathology department of Chongqing Medical University, and informed consent was waived by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University. The use of these human samples for this study was evaluated and approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University (2024-036-01). Liver injury cohort and the matched control subjects We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 113 patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University for acute exacerbation of chronic liver injury (including viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and acute liver failure) between June 2023 and September 2023. Clinical data, including age, sex, ALP, hyaluronic acid, laminin, N-terminal peptide of type III procollagen, type IV collagen, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and liver stiffness values, were collected for each participant retrospectively. In addition, 493 healthy individuals who underwent medical check-ups during the same period were also retrospectively included. Serum ALP level was collected from the medical history system. To minimize potential biases due to differences in age and sex distributions between the groups, propensity score matching was performed. We used logistic regression with liver injury as the dependent variable and age and sex as covariates. Nearest neighbor matching without replacement was employed for 1:1 matching, with a caliper value of 0.02. Consequently, 97 healthy patients were successfully matched to 97 patients with liver injury based on their propensity scores. The utilization of patient data and the analysis procedures were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University. Informed consent was waived given the retrospective nature of data analysis involving existing clinical records. The approval number is 2024-036-01.

Initially, we compared serum ALP concentrations between liver-injured patients and age-matched and sex-matched healthy individuals (N=97 for each group; Supplemental Table S2, http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 Fresh human liver tissues were obtained from individuals with non-fibrotic and cirrhotic conditions. Analysis revealed significantly elevated protein and mRNA levels of TNAP in cirrhotic liver tissues. Collagen I and α-SMA protein levels showed paralleled changes to TNAP expression (Figures 1 Sirius red 1 FIGURE 1 The expression of TNAP was increased during the progression of liver fibrosis.

TNAP is critical in regulating liver fibrosis in vivo To investigate the role of TNAP in liver fibrosis in vivo, we initially employed Tetra, an inhibitor of TNAP, to treat CCl 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 FIGURE 2 Effects of inhibition or overexpression of TNAP on CCl 4 4 4 4 4 4 8 4  * p  ** p  *** p 4 Mice were treated with overexpression adenovirus targeting TNAP (TNAP-OE, 1.26×10 10 10 8 2 4 2 2 2 4 To identify the main cell types affected by TNAP overexpression in liver fibrosis, we co-stained liver tissues with α-SMA and ALB (a marker of hepatocytes). In CCl4-induced fibrotic livers, α-SMA expression was significantly upregulated while ALB expression was markedly downregulated. Notably, collagen I deposition was predominantly colocalized with α-SMA-positive areas. TNAP overexpression further exacerbated these fibrotic changes: further reducing ALB expression while enhancing the overlapping of collagen I with α-SMA-positive areas (Supplemental Figure S2, http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 TNAP increased in a time-dependent manner during HSC activation and can regulate HSC activation in vitro Given that TNAP is predominantly expressed in liver interstitial cells and its correlation with α-SMA expression and HSC activation, which are crucial in the development of liver fibrosis, we conducted further investigations into its regulatory effects in vitro. Our study revealed that TNAP mRNA and protein expression progressively increased during primary HSC activation (quiescent HSCs to active HSCs) in a time-dependent manner, mirroring the expression patterns of the fibrotic genes α-SMA and collagen I (Figures 3 3 3 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 FIGURE 3 TNAP increased in a time-dependent manner during HSC activation and can regulate the activation of HSCs in vitro.

Previous literature suggested that TSP1 can activate TGF-β1 signaling by binding to CD36.  19 5  20 5 FIGURE 5 TNAP activates the TGF-β1 signaling pathway by promoting the binding of CD47 to TSP1.

The normal group was injected with olive oil; the CCL 4 4 4  * p  ** p  *** p 4 RNA-seq, Co-IP, and WB analyses demonstrated that TNAP regulates the expression of CD47 (Figures 4 5 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 Alpl CD47 TGF-β1 Smad2 Smad3 Acta2 Col1a1 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 Alpl Cd47 r TGF-β1 r Acta2 r Col1a1 r Cd47 TGF-β1 r Acta2 r Smad3 r Col1a1 r Subsequent investigation into CD47’s role in TGF-β1 signaling and HSC activation revealed that TNAP facilitated the conversion of latent TGF-β1 (TGF-β1–LAP) to mature TGF-β1, and this process could be blocked by CD47 antibody. Also, TNAP induced α-SMA overexpression, which could be diminished by the CD47 antibody. These results indicated that blocking CD47 significantly inhibited TNAP-mediated effects on HSCs activation (Figures 5 Further, we investigated whether the TNAP-mediated effects on HSCs activation can be mimicked by TSP1, and whether the TSP1 signaling can be blocked by inhibiting CD47. We found that TSP1 supplementation alone promoted HSCs activation and TGF-β1 signaling pathway activation, which was significantly inhibited by simultaneous CD47 blockade (Figures 5 5 Scratch and transwell assays further confirmed that inhibiting TNAP suppressed primary HSCs' proliferation and invasiveness, effects enhanced by TNAP overexpression but mitigated by blocking CD47 or TNAP inhibition (Figures 5 5 In conclusion, these findings suggest that TNAP promotes HSCs activation and liver fibrosis by facilitating the interaction between CD47 and TSP1, which in turn promotes the conversion of latent TGF-β1 to its active form. This activation of TGF-β1 downstream signaling contributes to HSCs activation and subsequent fibrosis progression in the liver. TNAP promotes membrane CD47 expression in HSCs Recent research has definitively established that the upregulation of the transmembrane protein CD47 is a pivotal mechanism in mediating downstream signals.  21 Our findings showed that activated HSCs (day 5) exhibited significantly increased membrane CD47 expression compared with quiescent HSCs (day 1). Modulation of TNAP expression, whether through overexpression or inhibition, predominantly influenced the presence of CD47 on the cell membrane. Treatment with an anti-CD47 antibody (Ab-CD47) markedly blocked membrane CD47 (Figures 6 6 FIGURE 6 TNAP promotes membrane CD47 in HSCs. (A, B) Surface CD47 protein expression was measured by confocal microscopy in primary HSCs on the 1st and 5th day after isolation from normal mouse liver.

This mechanism likely involves regulation of CD47 mRNA polyadenylation, influencing the subcellular distribution of CD47 protein and thereby contributing to TNAP-mediated activation of HSCs and potentially influencing liver fibrosis progression. DISCUSSION TNAP plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including bone mineralization and the regulation of phosphate metabolism.  9 24 , 25 1 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 4 1 24 , 25 Traditionally, TNAP was considered a consequence of liver damage. 12 , 26 7 , 27 2 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 HSCs are pivotal in liver fibrosis, serving as a major source of MFBs.  6  28 3  29 3 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 TGF-β1 plays a central role in HSCs activation and liver fibrosis.  29 4  30 4 Next, we used exogenous mature TGF-β1 and TGF-β1 receptor inhibitors to verify whether intervention with TNAP affects the TGF-β–Smads pathway. We used an in vitro auto-activated HSCs model and blocked the TGF-β1 receptor (P144 D) to observe whether overexpressed TNAP could still activate HSCs. Unexpectedly, although overexpression of TNAP favored the activation of HSCs, the pro-fibrotic effect of TNAP could not be exerted after the TGF-β1 signaling was blocked (Figures 4 Studies have demonstrated a regulatory role of TSP1 in activating the latent TGF-β1. 31 , 32  32  20  33 In the current study, in the CCl 4 5 http://links.lww.com/HC9/C94 5 5 5 7 FIGURE 7 The potential mechanism of TNAP in regulating liver fibrosis. Under normal circumstances, HSCs exist in its static state. TGF-β1 binds with LAP to form the TGF-β1–LAP complex and keeps its inactive form. When the liver is injured, the TGF-β1–LAP complex causes the conformational change, releasing mature TGF-β. The active form of TGF-β1 binds to TGFR to phosphorylate TGFR, which makes its downstream Smads phosphorylated and transferred into the nucleus to bind to DNA, regulate the transcription of α-SMA and collagen I, increase collagen deposition, and cause fibrosis. The upregulation of TNAP expression post liver injury plays an important role in the maturation of CD47 mRNA by adding a poly(A) tail at the 3’ end of the mRNA (3’ UTR). The increase of CD47 mRNA subtype of long 3’ UTR upregulates the expression of CD47 protein on the cell surface, promoting the binding of CD47 and TSP1, thus upregulating TGF-β1 conversion and promoting the occurrence of liver fibrosis.

The subcellular localization of CD47 determines its physiological cell functions.  34 6  35  36 6 While this study provides insights into the role of TNAP in liver fibrosis, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, TNAP activity was modulated via overexpression and inhibition approaches in vivo. Future studies employing HSC-specific TNAP manipulation (eg, conditional knockout in HSCs) would help clarify its cell-autonomous effects in fibrogenesis. Second, in vitro studies relied on primary cells, which inevitably exhibit batch-to-batch variations and may affect experimental reproducibility. Lastly, our data do not suggest a regulatory role for TNAP in CD47 mRNA splicing, while alternative splicing or isoform switching may theoretically occur. Addressing these limitations in future investigations will strengthen the robustness and translational relevance of our conclusions. CONCLUSIONS In summary, our findings suggested that TNAP may regulate the interaction between TSP1 and CD47, thereby influencing the activation of TGF-β1 and its downstream signaling pathways (Figure 7 Supplementary Material DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
