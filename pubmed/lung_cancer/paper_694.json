Although several vaccines are approved, developing more effective candidates remains essential for long-term prevention. In this study, we present a COVID-19 vaccine candidate using a virus-like vesicle (VLV) platform, an enveloped self-amplifying RNA replicon incorporating an evolved Semliki Forest virus RNA polymerase and VSV glycoprotein. Two constructs were generated: VLV-S-FL (full-length spike protein) and VLV-S-RBD (receptor-binding domain). In C57BL/6J mice, VLV-S-FL elicited robust anti-spike antibody and T cell responses, with antibody levels comparable to those induced by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Prime-boost immunization with VLV-S-FL provided in vivo protection against SARS-CoV-2. Notably, intranasal boosting enhanced mucosal immunity, including IgA production and recruitment of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and B cells in BALF. These findings suggest that VLV-S-FL is a promising COVID-19 vaccine capable of inducing both systemic and mucosal immune responses to prevent infection and reduce disease severity.

Most vaccination strategies focus on vaccines administered via intramuscular route that primarily induce systemic immunity. However, respiratory mucosal immunity is crucial for protecting against COVID-19, as the virus infects the upper and lower respiratory tracts via the ACE2 receptor 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 Virus-based platforms have been widely studied and tested in clinical trials for vaccine 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 As SARS-CoV-2 infection is primarily initiated through viral binding of the spike (S) glycoprotein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 In our study, we constructed two kinds of VLVs, VLV-S-FL and VLV-S-RBD, and found that VLV-S-FL, but not VLV-S-RBD, could elicit anti-spike protein-specific antibody responses in C57BL/6J mice and induce effective neutralizing antibody response with protective immunity against the SARS-CoV-2. The intranasal administration of VLV-S-FL induced substantial mucosal immunity, including IgA production and immune cell infiltration in the BALF. This suggests that the VLV platform could be used to develop a COVID-19 vaccine that provides strong systemic and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Results Design and construction of VLV-S-FL and VLV-S-RBD Given that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the S protein to enter host cells and that the S protein’s RBD region is the primary binding region for ACE2, we designed VLV vector vaccines that encode full-length and RBD sequences of the B.1.1.7 strain of spike protein, herein named VLV-S-FL and VLV-S-RBD, respectively (Fig. 1A Thosea asigna virus 24 3 4 1B 7 1 1C Fig. 1 Virus-like vesicle platform for COVID-19 vaccine expressing RBD or full length of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A B C Antibody responses elicited by VLV-S-FL and VLV-S-RBD in C57BL/6J mice To determine if VLV-S-FL or VLV-S-RBD could effectively elicit an antibody response, we immunized different groups of C57BL/6J mice with a single i.p. injection of either VLV-S-FL or VLV-S-RBD (10 8 2A 2B 8 2C 2D 2E Fig. 2 Anti-spike protein antibody responses in the serum of C57BL/6J mice immunized with PBS, VLV-S-RBD or VLV-S-FL.

To assess the stability of VLV-S-FL under different conditions, we stored it at room temperature (RT), 4 °C, −20 °C and −80 °C. We measured the TCID50 of VLV-S-FL over varying time periods. No significant differences in viral titers were observed across all storage temperatures on day 3. However, a noticeable decline in stability was detected at RT by day 7 and day 14. In contrast, storage at 4 °C, −20 °C, and −80 °C showed no significant changes in stability over the same period (Supplementary Fig. 2 Optimization of VLV-S-FL immunization strategies To further optimize the immunization procedure, we compared three vaccination strategies: a single dose intramuscular injection, intramuscular priming and boosting (i.m./i.m.), and intramuscular priming followed by intranasal boosting (i.m./i.n.). Initially, we administered VLV-S-FL i.m. and then boosted with VLV-S-FL either i.m. or intranasally (i.n.)

Most COVID-19 vaccines in development are administered i.m., focusing on inducing systemic immunity. However, intranasal vaccines have added advantage of inducing mucosal immunity, targeting the primary route of viral entry, and potentially blocking transmission. To investigate the potential mucosal immunity induced by VLV-S-FL, we immunized the mice i.n., i.m. combined with i.n., and i.n. combined with i.n., as shown in Fig. 6A 6B 6C Ifnb Ifnr Tnfa 6D 8 6E Fig. 6 VLV-S-FL elicited mucosal immune responses after intranasal vaccination.

A B C n 8 D E n 8 P P P Discussion The exploration of novel vaccines for COVID-19 remains crucial in combatting the threat of emerging viral mutations and the long-term public health challenges posed by the pandemic 4 38 The selection of a potent immunogenic target is an essential factor in developing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines 4 33 1B 2B 7 1 39 Currently, mRNA and adenoviral vector vaccines have been the primary strategies for COVID-19 immunization. The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine delivers messenger RNA encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into host cells, thereby triggering an adaptive immune response. Despite their promising, these vaccines face limitations, including the requirement for cold storage, relatively short duration of protection, and limited accessibility in low-resource regions 40 41 40 42 40 43 44 5 Several studies have demonstrated the importance of respiratory mucosal immunity in COVID-19 protection, as the virus infects the upper and lower respiratory tracts via the ACE2 receptor 8 9 45 6 46 47 Vaccine safety, stability and immunogenicity are critical concerns that should be carefully evaluated. To address safety, viral vectors are modified by removing the virulence genes while maintaining the capacity to enter host cells. This allows for efficient gene delivery without causing disease, mimicking the route of viral infection. Consequently, optimizing dosage and administration remains a key area for future investigation, as it may significantly influence vaccine efficacy and tolerability across individuals. In the study, we administrated a dose of 10 8 48 2 To further evaluate the clinical potential of VLV-S-FL, it is essential to assess both the durability of the immune responses it induces and its efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of numerous variants, such as Omicron, which have driven successive waves of infection worldwide 49 50 5G 51 53 54 59 Methods Cell line and plasmid information Hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) and Huh7.5 cell line cells were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (vol./vol.) fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 Recombinant plasmids encoding full-length or RBD sequences of the spike protein were constructed. Primers used for PCR amplification of the full-length spike protein sequence using the forward primer: 5′-TTAATTAAAATGACAGAATCTATTGTTAGATTTCCTAATATT-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-CCTGCAGGTTTGTTTTTAACCAAATTAGTAGACTTTTT-3′. Primers used for PCR amplification of the spike protein’s RBD sequence were, forward primer: 5′- GGCGCGGCGCCGGCGCGCCGCGTTAATTAAAATGTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTTATTGC -3′ and reverse primer: 5′-GCCGCATGCATCCTGCAGGTGTGTAATGTAATTTGACTCC-3′. Then, fragments of full-length or RBD were cloned into pCMV-SFVT2AG plasmids with modified cloning sites (PacI and SbfI) added to the 5′ and 3′ ends. Next, the gene of interest was inserted upstream of a ribosomal T2A skipping site and VSV-G protein. The T2A site allows for the expression of both the protein of interest and VSV G protein from the same promoter and ensures the readthrough of the full-length or RBD spike protein sequences, prior to VLV production. Transfection and recovery VLV-S-FL and VLV-S-RBD were recovered by transfecting BHK-21 cells with the pCMV-SFVFLT2AG and pCMV-SFVRBDT2AG plasmids, respectively. BHK-21 cells were seeded the day before transfection at a density of 3 × 10 5 g Immunostaining BHK-21 cells were seeded on the glass of chamber slides (Corning, NY) one day before infection with VLV-S-FL or VLV-S-RBD at MOI = 1. Cells were washed with PBS twice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 24 h post-infection, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X 100 for 5 min, followed by washing three times with PBS. Cells were blocked with PBS containing 2% FBS and incubated in a 1:200 dilution of mouse monoclonal VSV-G antibodies for 1 h. After extensive wash steps, cells were stained with a 1:500 dilution of secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. The stained slides were observed using a fluorescent microscope (Keyence, IL). Protein extraction and western blot analysis Cell lysates were harvested by RIPA buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Similar amounts of proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk or BSA dissolved in PBST (0.1% Tween in PBS), the membranes were incubated with anti-spike protein primary antibody (NBP3-12854, NOVUS) or anti-RBD primary antibody (A21254, ABclonal) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the membranes were washed three times in PBST, and probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times in PBST, the target protein bands were visualized by Bio-rad ChemiDoc XRS system (USA). Animals and immunizations Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice and 4- to 5-week-old B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J (K18-hACE2) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. In this study, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane in oxygen administered via inhalation within a closed chamber, ensuring they were fully unconscious prior to any procedures. Euthanasia was performed using carbon dioxide (CO 2 C57BL/6J mice ( n 8 n Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) 96-well plates were coated with 0.2 μg/well of purified spike protein (ACRO Biosystems, DE) in PBS at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk at 37 °C for 1 h. The serum was diluted at different ratios in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and then 100 μl of each was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBST, goat anti-mouse IgG/HRP was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After being washed, the substrate was added to the plate and incubated in the dark for 15 min. Then, the substrate reaction was stopped by adding H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 492 nm. Alternatively, the antibody levels were also expressed as endpoint titers. The serum obtained from mice was serially diluted, 10-fold, from 1:100 to 1:100000 and then tested by a plate reader to obtain the corresponding values. The IgA levels in BALF were detected as well. Flow cytometry Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected for analysis due to the minimally invasive nature of blood sampling, which enables consistent and standardized collection across experimental groups. This approach allowed for serial immune monitoring in the same animals without requiring euthanasia. Blood samples were collected from the immunized mice on days 3 and day 7 post-immunization. After red blood cell lysis and counting, the cells were stained with PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody and APC-conjugated anti-CD8a antibody for 30 min on ice in the dark, followed by two washes with 1X PBS buffer. All stained cells were analyzed by LSRII flow cytometer. Live cells were carefully gated by forward and side scattering. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), rather than lung tissue leukocytes, was collected to minimize potential confounding factors associated with tissue processing, such as regional variation in immune activation or infiltration. BALF samples were collected on day 28 post-immunization. The BALF was centrifuged at 600 × g RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis Splenocytes isolated from the naïve C57BL/6J mice were plated in 24-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 10 6 2 Tlr7 Irf3 Irf7 Ifna Ifnb Actb Il6 Ccl4 Ccl5 Tnfa Actb −ΔΔCt Neutralizing assay 1 × 10 4 60 Generation of SARS-CoV2 stocks SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCOV-19/USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was obtained from BEI Resources. For generating SARS-CoV2 stocks, Vero E6 cell overexpressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [kindly provided by B. Graham at the National Institutes of Health Vaccine Research Center (NIH-VRC)] were cultures in DMEM supplemented with 1% sodium pyruvate and 5% FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 for 2–3 days to propagate a viral solution. After incubation, the culture supernatant was clarified by centrifugation (500 × g SARS-CoV2 infection Vaccine-immunized mice were anesthetized by using 30% v/v isoflurane diluted in propylene glycol. A pipette delivered 50 μl of SARS-CoV2 virus (Isolate USA-WA1/2020) i.n. at 10 4 ELISPOT T cell response were determined using an IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) set (BD Biosciences, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 96-well plates were used for coating overnight with the purified anti-mouse IFN- γ antibody (1:200). The plate was rinsed and then blocked for 2 h using DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells collected from the BALF in the PBS, VLV-Ctrl and VLV-S-FL immunized mice. The cells were collected and mixed them in pool (5 mice per group). The cells were suspended in DMEM and seeded at 1 × 10 5 Data analysis All calculations and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, CA).
