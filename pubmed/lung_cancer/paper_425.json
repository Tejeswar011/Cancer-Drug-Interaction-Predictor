FEBS Open Bio https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This is an open access article under the terms of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ The tumor microenvironment (TME) is well known for its immune suppressive role, especially in solid tumors which are characterized by a thick, dense stroma. Apart from cell–cell interactions and biochemical signals, the tumor stroma is also characterized by its distinct mechanical properties, which are dictated by the composition and architecture of its extracellular matrix (ECM). Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the main producers and remodelers of the stromal ECM, and their heterogeneity has recently become a focus of intense research. This review describes recent findings highlighting CAF subtypes and their specific functions, as well as the development of 3D models to study tumor stroma mechanics in vitro This review discusses cancer‐associated fibroblast subtypes and their functions, particularly in relation to extracellular matrix production, as well as the development of 3D models to study tumor stroma mechanics in vitro cancer‐associated fibroblast extracellular matrix mechanobiology stiffness tumor mechanics Exacte en Natuurwetenschappen 10.13039/501100024870 R0007315 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025 Edited by Isabel Fabregat Abbreviations AFM atomic force microscopy BM Brillouin microscopy CAF cancer‐associated fibroblast ECM extracellular matrix LOX lysyl oxidase MDSCs myeloid‐derived suppressor cells MPT multiple particle tracking MR magnetic resonance MSC mesenchymal stem cell OC Optical Coherence PA Photoacoustic RT‐DC real‐time deformability cytometry SW shear wave TAGLN transgelin TFM traction force microscopy TME tumor microenvironment US ultrasound αSMA α‐smooth muscle actin In many solid tumors, the presence of a poorly vascularized, dense and extensive stromal compartment in the so‐called tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with tumor progression and bad prognosis. The TME includes different types of cells (e.g.: fibroblasts, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells etc), proteins (e.g.: collagen, laminin, fibronectin etc) and other biomolecules (e.g.: prostaglandins, cytokines and growth factors) around and within the tumor mass, which are collectively known as stroma. The intricate interplay among all these cellular and molecular components dictates whether the TME if pro‐ or anti‐tumorigenic. Therefore, the TME is associated with tumor invasiveness, decreased drug efficacy and therapy resistance which ultimately results in poor prognosis [ 1 2 3 In the TME, fibroblasts can differentiate into cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a highly heterogeneous cell population that directly affects tumor growth and invasion, and significantly impact therapeutic outcomes [ 4 4 5 6 7 1A 2 8 9 10 11 12 13 Fig. 1 CAF subtypes shape the TME. (A) The TME and its constituents. The TME includes the tumor lesion as well as the surrounding stroma. In the TME, the stromal ECM can become thicker and more aligned and this is known to facilitate tumor growth and invasion. myCAFs are the major ECM producers while iCAFs secrete cytokines and modulate the immune environment. (B) Phenotypic plasticity of CAFs. CAFs can undergo phenotypic changes as a consequence of converging stimulatory pathways. TGFβ is known as the main inducer of myCAF phenotype. Inhibition of TGFβ has been reported to promote phenotypic changes towards apCAF phenotype. In addition, TGFβ is suggested to inhibit IL1R1 production in iCAFs. Inflammatory pathways can lead to iCAF and apCAF induction; however, the exact signaling pathway still needs to be elucidated. With respect to the surrounding healthy tissue, the ECM composition and architecture of the tumor stroma confer characteristic mechanical properties to the TME (e.g. increased stiffness), which may have both a diagnostic and a prognostic value [ 14 15 16 17 in vitro Cancer‐associated fibroblasts; subtypes, functions, and plasticity Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are main producers and crucial regulators of the stromal compartment within the tumor microenvironment (TME), where they can greatly influence tumor growth and dissemination [ 18 19 20 21 1B 20 21 22 23 Despite CAFs' ability of undergoing different cellular states, common ground has been found when defining function‐based CAF subtypes. Certain specific subtypes have been repeatedly described in different studies, providing CAF subtype standardization: these subtypes are known as myofibroblast CAFs (myCAFs), immunomodulatory CAFs (iCAFs) and antigen‐presenting CAFs (apCAFs) [ 20 24 25 26 27 28 1B 20 22 24 29 20 in vivo 26 26 30 31 32 A detailed overview of CAF subtypes and the specific markers used for their classification falls outside the scope of this review, and for this, we redirect the reader to several recent publications [ 4 17 19 22 23 33 26 27 34 27 26 35 36 33 Besides a different ontogeny, another aspect significantly contributes to CAF heterogeneity: some CAF subsets are not permanent but interconvertible via activation of specific signaling pathways [ 5 37 38 39 40 20 24 24 27 41 26 Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving CAF subtype plasticity will be essential for the cancer biology research field and detailed studies of CAF ontogeny in the future are warranted.  CAF ECM One of the most impactful functions of CAFs within the TME is production, deposition, and remodeling of the ECM, and this function has predominantly been assigned to myCAFs [ 17 26 42 43 44 45 46 45 47 48 The aberrant biochemical and biophysical properties of the stromal ECM have also repercussions on the behavior of other TME resident cells, starting with cancer cells [ 16 49 50 51 52 Stromal ECM architecture and composition can directly affect immune cells as well [ 53 in vitro 54 in vivo 55 56 55 57 58 59 As several studies indeed confirm the role of the ECM in disease development, targeting of the CAF‐ECM axis is emerging as an appealing approach to modulate ECM properties and facilitate cancer eradication. For example, targeting of LOX resulted in less stiff matrices and increased intratumoral T cell infiltration [ 60 in vivo 61 62  3D CAF To date, studies on the TME mostly rely on cell cultures in 2D or on cell spheroids. These systems do not require specialized equipment, are readily accessible for inspections and rely on well‐established methodologies. Yet, cell monolayers and spheroids do not fully capture the heterogeneous composition and structural complexity of the TME as they lack the stromal components. Attempts to reproduce this complexity are represented by cocultures, either on flat surfaces or in spheroids, of different cell types including stromal cells, immune cells or endothelial cells [ 63 64 65 66 A central feature of tumors is their heterogeneity that cannot be reproduced in vitro in vitro 67 in vivo 68 69 70 71 72 in vitro 73 In the last few years, microfluidics devices have become increasingly useful to better control the TME conditions in vitro 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 79 81 Despite these interesting developments, it remains challenging to study the interplay between CAFs (and other cell types) and the stromal ECM, as spheroids and organoids require the use of culturing “scaffolds” such as fibrillar collagen gels or ECM extracts (e.g. Matrigel) that do not faithfully reproduce the complexity of the TME stromal ECM. Furthermore, complex 3D scaffold makes it difficult visualize cells with high spatial resolution or to have “access” to cells for direct stimulation, for instance mechanical or chemical conditioning can be done macroscopically, whereas local stimulation requires specialized equipment. Interestingly, cells on 1D structures display morphological and migratory features typical of 3D settings, but not observed in 2D [ 82 83 et al 84 How to measure mechanical signals of the stroma An accurate assessment of CAF‐generated forces and stroma mechanical properties could provide relevant information for a better identification of the stages of cancer progression. Several investigative techniques can be used to measure various aspects of CAF or stroma mechanics, including pulling forces, pressure, elastic and viscoelastic properties, and their morphology (Table 1 Table 1 Overview of quantitative techniques to measure mechanical properties of cells and tissues. Force/modulus range Measurement Spatial resolution Advantages Disadvantages AFM 10 pN – 100 nN [ 111 Elasticity, viscoelasticity, adhesion forces 1–10 nm [ 112 High spatial resolution; high sensitivity; overlaps imaging and force maps; single molecule level Complex and expensive; slow data acquisition; moduli are estimated from mathematical models. TFM 1 pN – 100 nN [ 113 Cell forces 100 nm [ 114 Cell‐environment interaction; Non‐invasive Requires cell/protein labeling; might be computationally intensive; limited to compliant substrates.

The spatial force resolution depends on the ability to precisely measure the markers displacement by fluorescence microscopy and on the accuracy in the estimation of the material constants of the medium. TFM has been used to characterize the contractile behavior of CAFs and the dynamic interplay between CAF and colorectal cancer cells. CAFs exhibited a supracellular organization through fibronectin cables to build‐up compressive stresses within intratumoral capsules. The increased CAF‐induced compressive stresses promote cancer cell packing and a release of nuclear tension, which in turn favors YAP nuclear export [ 50 91 92 Similar to TFM, multiple particle tracking (MPT) rheology tracks thermal fluctuations of nanoparticles within gels, cells, or tissues. From the particle tracks, MPT rheology can deduce information on the viscoelastic properties of the medium. Although not routinely used in CAF‐stroma studies, MPT has been employed to study the different microrheological behavior of CAF or normal fibroblast (NF) spheroids of in vitro 93 The techniques mentioned above suffer of a limited throughput allowing to analyze a few cells per hour. An emerging technique that dramatically increases the throughput (100–1000 cells/s) is the real‐time deformability cytometry (RT‐DC), a label‐free technology that measures cell deformation under hydrodynamic forces in microfluidic channels [ 94 et al 95 95 These techniques are extremely useful to study the mechanical properties of cells and stroma that, together with the biochemical properties, could enhance the diagnostic or prognostic outcomes of tumor tissue analyses. While they can be used in vitro ex vivo in vivo in vivo Ultrasound (US) elastography can assess variation in tissue stiffness, thus providing evidence of tumor onset or progression. Several US‐based elastographic methods have been developed so far. Among these, shear wave (SW) elastography provides quantitative elastographic maps by measuring the propagation speed of waves into the tissue. SWs are generated in the tissue with a focused beam of US waves, which can penetrate a few millimeters in the tissue. SW‐US elastography can inform about tumor stiffness and its changes along with changes in stroma components. Riegler et al 96 in vivo ex vivo in vivo Similar to SW‐US elastography, Magnetic Resonance (MR) elastography exploits the propagation of SWs to estimate the local tissue stiffness. In MR elastography, SWs are generated by an external electromechanical transducer on the surface of the body. Then, MR imaging is used to evaluate SW speed and wavelength. Stiffer tumor tissues enable waves to propagate faster hence emphasizing a mechanical contrast with the surrounding softer tissues. Using MR elastography Kader et al 97 US‐based techniques lack in spatial resolution, which is in the millimeter range. Techniques using different energy sources, e.g. light, provide much more detailed elasticity maps. For example, Optical Coherence (OC) elastography involves the application of static or dynamic mechanical stresses (like US and MR elastography) and measures tissue deformation using OC tomography that is an interferometric technique that generates images by measuring delays and intensities of waves back‐reflected from the tissue, with respect to a reference wave. Using light rather than US, OC elastography has a much higher spatial resolution (in the micrometer range), but its penetration depth is, however, still limited to a few millimeters [ 98 et al 99 99 Photoacoustic (PA) elastography is another optical technique that is gaining popularity for its improved spatial resolution and versatility. The technique is based on the generation of mechanical (acoustic) waves by laser light pulses in the visible or near infrared region that propagate through a medium or tissue. As acoustic waves travel faster in stiffer regions, a map of stiffnesses can be generated. Despite its potentials, studies related to PA elastography in the assessment of the physical features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are limited. Interestingly, a modified version of elastography accounting for tissue viscoelasticity was used for the characterization of an ectopic breast cancer in mice [ 100 A very promising label‐free technique that can produce micron scale elastographic maps is the Brillouin microscopy (BM) [ 101 102 103 104 et al 105 105 The techniques described above provide a comprehensive set of tools which are effective at different length scales and can probe different stiffness ranges. Integrating high‐resolution imaging, detailed mechanical data and molecular analyses would certainly improve our understanding of the mechanobiology of CAFs and on the impact of tumor stroma on the evolution of the disease. This could ultimately contribute to develop novel diagnostic devices or possibly novel therapeutic agents targeting ECM compounds of the tumor stroma. Conclusions and open questions The mechanical properties of the stroma as dictated by the dynamic interplay among CAFs (and CAF subtypes), their ECM, tumor‐resident immune cells and cancer cells are increasingly acknowledged as important orchestrators of tumor growth and invasion as well as novel diagnostic tools. It is therefore not surprising that significant efforts are invested in the development of in vitro 106 et al 107 108 109 110 Conflict of interest All authors do not have any actual or potential conflict of interest including any financial, personal or other relationships with other people or organizations within 3 years of beginning the submitted work that could inappropriately influence, or be perceived to influence, their work.
