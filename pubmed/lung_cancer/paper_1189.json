Introduction Lung cancer remains the primary cause of cancer-related mortality, with 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths reported in 2020. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes 80% to 85% of all lung cancer cases [ 1 2 3 Solanum lyratum 4 S. lyratum 5 S. lyratum 50 6 7 Figure 1 8 9 10 Exosomes are a kind of 30–150 nm vesicles released by most type of cells including tumor cells. Emerging evidence indicates that tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) facilitate tumor metastasis by transferring bioactive molecules to establish the premetastatic niche [ 11 12 13 Figure 2 2. Results 2.1. Characterization of Exosomes The ADEs were successfully isolated from the A549 cell medium, as verified by transmission electron microscopy ( Figure 3 Figure 3 9 Figure 3 Table 1 2.2. Exosomes Derived from SA1-Treated A549 Cells Inhibits NSCLC Tumor Growth No apparent changes were observed in the appearance or behavioral status of the mice throughout the experiment. The body weight in the model group, control exosome group, and SA1 exosome group showed a considerable increasing trend, whereas a more moderate increase was observed in the Taxol group ( Figure 4 Figure 4 3 3 Table 2 2.3. Global Proteomics Analysis of SA1-Treated A549 Cells and the Derived Exosomes To elucidate the mechanism underlying SA1-mediated tumor suppression, we conducted label-free quantitative proteomics analysis on both SA1-treated A549 cells and their secreted exosomes. In SA1-treated A549 cells, 1154 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, including 692 upregulated and 462 downregulated proteins compared to the control group ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.4. Protein Enrichment and Function Analysis Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was first conducted to characterize the DEPs. The top ten significantly enriched GO terms are shown in Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Ingenuity pathway analysis identified 534 signaling pathways related to DEPs in A549 cells. The signaling pathways ranked by significance are shown in Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 2.5. Validation of Significantly Regulated DEPs To validate the proteomic findings, we selected five highly regulated DEPs, including Mucin-5B (MUC5B) and Apolipoprotein B (APOB) in A549 cells ( Table 3 Table 4 Figure 10 p −7 p p p p Figure 10 Figure 10 3. Discussion With the rising morbidity and mortality of lung cancer, effective strategies for preventing and treating NSCLC remain challenging. In this study, SA1 was investigated as a potential anti-NSCLC agent. The results demonstrated that exosomes derived from SA1-treated A549 cells significantly suppressed tumor growth in A549 xenograft mice. Notably, the tumor inhibition rate in the SA1 exosome group exceeded that of the Taxol group, a commonly used first-line clinical chemotherapeutic agent. Given that TDEs promote tumor survival and progression by facilitating intercellular communication, targeting TDE formation represents a promising therapeutic strategy. However, the control exosome group also showed an inhibitory effect, which appears inconsistent with the generally recognized pro-tumor role of TDEs. One possible explanation is that when numerous exosomes were injected into mice, the immune responses in the body might have been strongly stimulated to fight against them, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms need to be better understood and exploited. Despite this observation, the findings still strongly suggest that SA1 exhibits significant anti-NSCLC property by intervening ADEs. TDE vesicles originate from the outward budding of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, implicating lipid rafts not only in TDE biogenesis but also in their mechanisms of action on target cells. Beyond providing structural integrity, lipids play an active role in exosome formation [ 14 15 16 17 18 The proteomics can help find the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer occurrence and identify cancer-related proteins, which are commonly used for cancer research [ 19 Compared with the control group, 692 DEPs of cells were upregulated after SA1 intervention, among which the most significant protein was APOB. As a key lipid transport protein, APOB may be involved in metabolic reprogramming of NSCLC cells. Previous studies have reported significantly abnormal APOB expression in plasma exosomes of lung cancer patients with liver metastasis, suggesting its potential as a novel biomarker for diagnosing lung cancer [ 20 21 22 Another significantly regulated DEP by SA1 is MUC5B. As a mucin, overexpression of MUC5B is closely associated with enhanced invasiveness and poor prognosis in multiple cancers [ 23 20 24 25 Compared with the control group, 629 DEPs of exosomes were upregulated after SA1 intervention, among which the most significant regulated protein was GCN1, the activator of EIF2-alpha kinase GCN2. GCN1 functions as a ribosome collision sensor and plays a pivotal role in the RNF14–RNF25-mediated translation quality control pathway. This pathway is activated when ribosome stalling occurs during translation, leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of associated translation factors on the stalled ribosomes [ 26 27 Additionally, SA1 treatment also resulted in the downregulation of 117 exosomal proteins, with MFGM (also known as MFG-E8) being the most significantly suppressed. MFGM is an anti-inflammatory glycoprotein implicated in the regulation of multiple pathophysiological processes. Previous studies have reported that MFGM is overexpressed in various cancers and is considered a key regulator of cancer cell invasion, migration, and proliferation. For example, MFGM is an oncogenic protein in angiosarcoma and patients with overexpressed MFGM showed short progression-free survival and overall survival time [ 28 29 30 Another protein significantly regulated by SA1 is ANGL4, a secreted protein belonging to the angiopoietin-like family, which plays a key role in promoting angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. In NSCLC cells, ANGL4 is involved in regulating metabolic processes such as aerobic glycolysis, glutamine consumption, and fatty acid oxidation, thereby influencing cell proliferation and energy homeostasis [ 31 32 Following functional analysis of the aforementioned proteins, we identified that MFGM, APOB, and MUC5B are closely associated with “membrane structure” and “secretory processes”. Previous studies have indicated that increased membrane permeability under pathological conditions may lead to ion influx and leakage of intracellular components. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that SA1 may contribute to the maintenance of cellular lipid metabolic homeostasis and membrane stability through regulating MFGM, APOB, and MUC5B. It has been reported that homologs or structural analogs of SA1 are involved in lipid metabolism [ 33 34 Based on the pathway and function enrichment results, we observed that the DEPs in A549 cells were predominantly localized to the mitochondria. Beyond their role in providing energy, mitochondria participate in the process of generating nucleic acid precursors, the basic unit of DNA. Without mitochondria, tumor cells are unable to synthesize new DNA and thus cannot proliferate [ 35 36 Apart from the mitochondrial dysfunction pathway, the DEPs in A549 cells were significantly enriched in the sirtuin pathway. The sirtuin protein family (SIRT1–SIRT7) plays crucial roles in tumorigenesis. SIRT1 is involved in DNA damage repair and contributes to genomic stability, thereby influencing tumor cell proliferation [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 Ribosome biogenesis is frequently upregulated in tumors and contributes to the early stages of tumorigenesis. A hallmark of cancer cells is their enhanced ribosome function, which supports the increased protein synthesis required for rapid proliferation [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Regents SA1 was isolated from S. lyratum 8 4.2. Cell Line and Culture Conditions The human lung cancer cell line A549 was obtained from Jiangsu KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China), and the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% ( v v 2 4.3. Exosome Extraction A549 cells in logarithmic phase were exposed to SA1 for 48 h. The cells were divided into the SA1 group (final concentration 10 μM) and the control group. Then, the medium was harvested and the exosomes were obtained using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Runcorn, Cheshire, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, the medium was centrifuged for 30 min at 2000× g g g 4.4. Assessment of Exosome Characteristics The characterization of exosomes was performed according to our previous study [ 10 g 4.5. Animal Model Establishment and Anti-NSCLC Efficacy Study BALB/c nude mice (4 weeks old) were bought from Shanghai Lingchang Biotech Ltd., Shanghai, China (SCXK-HU 2018-0003). The animal studies were authorized by the Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Committee of KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China (IACUC-001-5). The animals were housed at 24 °C, with a relative humidity of 60–70%, under a 12 h light/dark cycle. All of them have a libitum access to food and water. A549 cells in logarithmic phase were collected and adjusted to 1 × 10 7 3 2 4.6. Sample Preparation for Proteomics Analysis Proteins from each group (200 µg) were acetone-precipitated overnight and centrifuged at 15,000× g g 4.7. Peptide Identification by LC-MS/MS Proteome analysis was performed with a Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The dried peptide fractions were dissolved in 2% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, and subsequently loaded on a C18 column (5 mm length, 100 µm inner diameter, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), followed by an analytical C18 column (250 mm length, 75 µm inner diameter, Eksigent). Typically, the elution gradients (Phase A, water-0.1% formic acid, Phase B, acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid) changed in 78 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min (the gradient B ramped from 6% at 0 min to 10% at 8 min, 30% at 58 min, 40% at 70 min, and 95% at 78 min, respectively). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode to switch between Orbitrap-MS and ion trap acquisition automatically. An electrospray voltage of 2.0 kV versus the inlet of the mass spectrometer was used. Surveys of full-scan MS spectra (from m z 4.8. Data Processing and Functional Analysis of DEPs Protein quantification and label-free quantitative normalization of the MS/MS data were performed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.16, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Planegg, Germany. https://www.maxquant.org/maxquant/ Protein groups identified only by peptides with modified sites, contaminant matches, and matches to the reverse database were removed. Protein abundance was calculated on the basis of the normalized spectral protein intensity. The unpaired Student’s t-tests were used to compare the two groups. Only proteins with a probability for significant protein abundance changes with a p https://sourceforge.net/projects/mev-tm4/files/mev-tm4/ https://www.kegg.jp/ https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/products-overview/discovery-insights-portfolio/analysis-and-visualization/qiagen-ipa/ 4.9. Bioinformatics Analysis of Database The bioinformatics analysis of DEPs in lung cancer patients was performed using Kaplan–Meier Plotter database ( https://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&cancer=lung 4.10. Western Blot Analysis Western blot was performed to verify the expression of targeted proteins. The extraction and quantification of proteins were completely identical with that used in label-free quantitative. Then, the quantified proteins (20 μg) from A549 and ADEs were separated by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Mehler, Hückelhoven, Germany). Membranes were then blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 1.5 h at 25 °C. The band was washed with TBST and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies and concentrations were as follows: anti-MUC5B (1:1000), anti-MFGM monoclonal antibody (1:5000), anti-ANGL4 (1:1000), anti-GCN1 (1:3000), and anti-APOB (1:1000). GADPH in A549 cells was used as the internal reference. The total protein concentration in exosomes was used as the loading control. After being washed with TBST buffer, the membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (1:2000) for 2 h at 25 °C. The membranes were subsequently washed with TBST and visualized using an ECL reagent. 4.11. Statistical Analysis The results were provided as mean ± SD. Differences between groups were assessed through Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA by SPSS 17.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). p 5. Conclusions In summary, SA1 showed a notable anti-NSCLC property by regulating exosome function and altering the expression of associated proteins. Five potential targets (APOB, GCN1, MUC5B, MFGM and ANGL4) together with two key pathways (ribosome and spliceosome) may contribute to its efficacy and warrant further investigation. The study provides novel insights into the anti-NSCLC mechanism of SA1 through proteomic profiling and highlights its potential as a promising therapeutic candidate for lung cancer treatment.
