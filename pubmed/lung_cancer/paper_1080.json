Interestingly, a higher body mass index (BMI) has been associated with improved outcomes in immunotherapy, a phenomenon termed the “obesity paradox.” This study investigates the influence of BMI on the effectiveness of immune combination therapies in Japanese patients with metastatic RCC. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 243 Japanese patients with metastatic RCC who received immune combination therapies between 2018 and 2022. Patients were stratified into two groups: non-overweight/obesity (BMI < 25 kg/m 2 2 Results There was no significant difference in PFS between the groups. However, the overweight/obesity group showed a trend toward longer OS, particularly in patients receiving IO–IO regimens (P = 0.011). In contrast, although no statistically significant difference was observed in the IO–TKI regimen, there was a trend toward prolonged OS in the non-overweight/obesity group. No significant differences in immune-related adverse events were observed between the groups. Conclusion Higher BMI may be associated with better outcomes in immune combination therapy, especially with IO–IO regimens. These findings suggest that BMI could be a useful factor in optimizing RCC treatment. Further research with larger cohorts is needed to confirm these results and understand the mechanisms behind the “obesity paradox.” Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10147-025-02823-0.

Nivolumab + ipilimumab, axitinib + pembrolizumab, axitinib + avelumab, cabozantinib + nivolumab, and lenvatinib + pembrolizumab have all shown promising results compared to sunitinib monotherapy and are now used as the first line for metastatic RCC [ 5 9 Body mass index (BMI) is a commonly used indicator for evaluating whether a person’s weight is healthy for their height. Previous reports have suggested a complex relationship between BMI and immunotherapy outcomes [ 10 11 13 This study aimed to clarify the relationship between immune combination therapy and BMI in patients with metastatic RCC living in Japan. Our results might contribute to a better understanding of the factors that affect the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with RCC and prove useful in the context of optimizing treatment strategies for this deadly malignancy. Patients and methods Participants This retrospective multicenter study analyzed 243 patients who were clinically diagnosed with metastatic RCC between August 1, 2018 and January 31, 2022, at 34 facilities belonging to the Japan Urological Oncology Group, received immune combination therapy as their primary treatments, and received molecular targeted drugs as their secondary ones. In the dataset we selected, the immune combination therapy used was nivolumab + ipilimumab, axitinib + pembrolizumab, and axitinib + avelumab. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hamamatsu University School of Medicine (approval no.: 22-008), as well as the ethics committees of all 34 participating institutions. The requirement for informed consent was waived in favor of an opt-out approach. Evaluation Patient data were retrospectively collected from each facility. BMI was defined as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. Based on the classification published by the World Health Organization, a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 2 2 The best response was evaluated using the RECIST v1.1 criteria, and defined as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). Overall survival (OS) was defined as the period from the start of primary treatment until death, whereas progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the period from the start of immune combination therapy until disease progression or death from any cause. Statistical analysis Our statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA, USA), with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. Comparisons between the two groups were performed using Mann–Whitney U and Fisher’s exact tests. PFS and OS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and differences between the two groups were compared using the log-rank test.

We compared the PFS and OS of patients who received IO–IO between the NOG and OG categories (Fig. 3 1 2 3 Fig. 3 Survival analysis for each immune combination therapy regimen stratified by body mass index (BMI). a b c d Discussion This study aimed to clarify the relationship between immune combination therapy and BMI in Japanese patients with metastatic RCC. Valuable insights were obtained regarding this intricate relationship. We found that our patients in the OG group tended to have better prognoses; however, the difference was not statistically significant. This observation contradicts one in a previous report that the all-cause mortality rate rose by ~ 30% for every 5 kg/m 2 14 15 16 17 2 18 There may be a relationship between irAE and the effect of immunotherapy. If immunotherapy is highly impactful in overweight patients, the irAE onset might be high. In a report that analyzed the relationship between irAE and BMI, based on this hypothesis, across a variety of cancers, patients with BMIs of ≥ 25 kg/m 2 19 19 In the present study, a subgroup analysis was performed to examine how patient characteristics such as age, sex, histological type, nutritional status, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, IMDC risk classification, and treatment regimen used affected PFS and OS in the NOG and OG categories. Notably, the effect of BMI on prognosis clearly varied depending on the regimen. In the patients who were treated via IO–IO, the category with BMI values of ≥ 25 kg/m 2 2 20 2 15 2 This study was subject to some key limitations worth noting. First, it was a retrospective study, indicating that it is inherently subject to various biases. Second, owing to the observation period, none of the included patients received the treatment regimens of cabozantinib + nivolumab or lenvatinib + pembrolizumab, which are currently popular for patients with metastatic RCC. Third, patients who achieved long-term success with only primary treatment, as well as those who faced challenges in continuing their treatments, were excluded. Therefore, this study cannot rule out the possibility that the therapeutic effects of secondary treatment may have influenced the outcomes. Finally, in addition to the main analysis of the entire population, subgroup analyses by treatment regimen (IO–IO group and IO–TKI group) were also conducted. However, due to the limited number of cases in each subgroup, sufficiently robust analyses could not be performed. Validation using a larger cohort is warranted in future studies. The results of this study will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of the factors affecting the efficacy of immune combination therapy in patients with RCC. This knowledge may help to optimize treatment strategies for this deadly malignancy, by considering each patient’s BMI and the specific treatment regimen being proposed. However, further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed “obesity paradox,” as well as to confirm our findings in larger patient cohorts.
