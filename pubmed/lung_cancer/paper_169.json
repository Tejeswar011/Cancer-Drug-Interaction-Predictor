Objectives This study aimed to compare systematically strain-specific immune differences between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice in a local tolerance model and explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice received daily intranasal ovalbumin (OVA; 25 mg/ml, 10μl/nostril) or PBS for 15 weeks. Systemic responses (serum OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2a; splenocyte cytokine secretion: IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ) and local nasal responses (symptoms, histopathology: polymorphonuclear/goblet cell infiltration; immunohistochemistry: TGF-β, IL-10, eotaxin; RNA-seq transcriptomics of nasal mucosa) were assessed at the 8th and 15th weeks. Results BALB/c mice initially exhibited worsening nasal symptoms, which was followed by significant alleviation. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice showed a significant worsening of symptoms. Serum levels of IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a increased significantly over time in BALB/c mice. In C57BL/6 mice, serum IgE and IgG1 levels also increased significantly, while IgG2a levels showed no significant changes. In splenocyte supernatants, BALB/c mice showed IL-4 levels that initially increased significantly but later decreased significantly, whereas IL-10 levels were significantly elevated and sustained. Conversely, C57BL/6 mice exhibited no significant changes in these splenocyte cytokines. Within nasal mucosa, BALB/c mice displayed polymorphonuclear cell infiltration and significantly elevated eotaxin levels, which subsequently stabilized, alongside significant upregulation of TGF-β and IL-10 expression. At 15th week, C57BL/6 mice demonstrated significantly higher nasal PMN infiltration and eotaxin levels compared to BALB/c mice, but showed no significant increase in TGF-β or IL-10 compared to controls. RNA-seq analysis of nasal mucosa revealed that BALB/c mice at 15th week exhibited significant upregulation of genes involved in biological processes, tolerance-related signaling pathways, and negative regulatory pathways. Conversely, C57BL/6 mice showed significant upregulation of genes associated with cell synthesis- and secretion-related pathways. Conclusion Based on the criteria defining “local tolerance” in this model—significant symptom attenuation despite allergen escalation coupled with downregulation of nasal inflammatory markers (eotaxin, polymorphonuclear cell infiltration)—local tolerance was successfully induced in BALB/c mice by long-term OVA stimulation, but not in C57BL/6 mice. The normal function of T regulatory cells is key to establishing local tolerance.

Epidemiological studies have shown that the prevalence of AR is increasing every year and poses a burden to society. 1 2 Extensive clinical studies have established that subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) with grass pollen allergens induces immune tolerance in humans, manifesting as significant improvement in nasal/ocular symptoms, enhanced quality of life, prolonged symptom remission after treatment cessation, and elevated tolerance thresholds in nasal provocation tests. 3 Escherichia coli 4 Studies in humans and mice suggest that regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory antigen-presenting cells (APCs), other suppressor cells, and cytokines make important contributions to the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance. 5 6 7 8 , 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 In this study, we administered a specific dose of ovalbumin (OVA) to induce long-term continuous nasal drip in both mouse strains to systematically compare the immunological differences, particularly those related to immune tolerance, and to provide further evidence on the mechanisms of local and systemic immune tolerance. Materials and methods Experimental animals Forty-eight female mice (24 BALB/c and 24C57BL/6), aged 5 weeks, SPF grade, were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, approval number 2844. Model construction BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: BALB/c PBS group, BALB/c OVA group, C57BL/6 PBS group, and C57BL/6 OVA group. Each group contained 12 animals. The mice were dripped with phosphate buffered solution (PBS) or 25 mg/ml OVA daily, 10ul on each side of the nasal cavity. Half of the mice in each group were sacrificed on 8th week, and the remaining mice were sacrificed on 15th week, ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 General flow diagram of experiment. Fig. 1 According to a previous study, the symptoms of BALB/c mice peak at the 8th week, and the symptoms of C57BL/6 mice also peak at 8th∼9th week. Serum-specific antibodies and localized nasal mucosal polymorphonuclear cells in both mice also increased significantly. 2 Allergic symptoms Sneezing was the most prominent symptom; therefore, we counted the number of sneezes to reflect the severity of nasal symptoms. We recorded the number of sneezes within 10 min after nasal drip on the first day at 0th, 4th, 8th, 12th, and 15th week. Detection of serum OVA-specific antibody levels Blood was collected from the tail vein of the mice every 3 weeks and within 24h after the last nasal drip at the 15th week. The blood was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min by ultracentrifugation, and the upper layer of yellowish serum was stored at −20 °C for examination. The OD values of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a were determined using ELISA (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Splenocyte culture and cytokine level assay After deep anesthesia with isoflurane, the mice were treated with cervical dislocation and disinfected with 75% alcohol. The spleens were removed from mice on an ultra-clean bench (Aintech, Suzhou, China) and ground into centrifuge tubes using RPMI-1640 (Hyclone, Beijing, China) with a 200-mesh filter. After centrifugation for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, the cell precipitate was resuspended in RPMI-1640, and lymphocytes were isolated using a Mouse Spleen Lymphocyte Isolation Kit (TBDscience, Tianjin, China). Lymphocytes (5∗10 6 Histology of the nasal mucosa The nasal mucosa was extracted according to the Dunston method. 17 18 Immunohistochemical staining Paraffin sections of the nasal mucosa were sequentially dewaxed, rehydrated, and antigen-repaired. The sections were then treated with a blocking solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 45 min. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with TGF-β antibody (Abcam, Shanghai, China), IL-10 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and eotaxin antibody (Proteintech, Wuhan, China) and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Boster, Wuhan, China), followed by DAB color development. Subsequently, hematoxylin was re-stained, dehydrated, made transparent, sealed, and placed under a light microscope for examination. Expression levels of eotaxin, IL-10, and TGF-β were quantified using IOD/area (integrated optical density per unit area) analysis. Gene sequencing Lyophilized nasal mucosa was subjected to RNA sequencing analysis. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and subjected to DNA digestion. RNA quality was determined using a NanodropTM OneC spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Science Inc., USA), and RNA integrity was confirmed using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Qualified RNA was quantified using the Qubit 3.0. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using a Ribooff rRNA Depletion Kit (human/mouse/rat). Sequencing was performed using a DNBSEQ-T7 sequencer (MGI Tech Co., Ltd., China). After the raw data were filtered, genes differentially expressed between groups were identified using the edgeR package (3.12.1), and P < 0.05 and logFC cutoff values were set to 2 to determine the statistical significance of gene expression differences. This stringent cutoff was selected to prioritize biologically significant changes, as a logFC of 2 represents a 4-fold change in expression, reducing false positives while capturing key regulatory genes in tolerance pathways. Gene ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of differentially expressed genes were performed using KOBAS software (version 2.1.1). Differentially expressed genes were entered into the search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes (STRING) database to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of differentially expressed genes. The CytoHubba plug-in in the Cytoscape software was used to calculate the connectivity of protein nodes and to screen for significantly different proteomic modules. The top 10 genes were identified as core genes that were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism 9.0 and SPSS 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY) were used for statistical analysis. Allergic symptoms, serum-specific antibodies, cytokines in the splenic culture supernatant, and the number of polymorphonuclear cells were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Tukey's multiple comparison method in one-way ANOVA was used to assess the statistical significance of symptoms, serum antibodies, cytokine concentrations, polymorphonuclear cell and goblet cell numbers and immunohistochemical indices. The sample sizes required for each experiment are shown in Supplemental Table 1 Results Nasal symptoms The BALB/c PBS and C57BL/6 PBS groups maintained low symptom levels throughout the study. In contrast, both OVA groups (BALB/c and C57BL/6) developed symptoms starting in 4th week. Within the BALB/c OVA group, nasal symptoms peaked during 7-8th weeks (0th week vs. 8th week, p < 0.01) and then decreased significantly, remaining lower from 10th week to 15th week (8th week vs 15th week, p < 0.05). Conversely, the C57BL/6 OVA group reached peak symptoms during 8-9th week (0th week vs. 8th week, p < 0.01) and exhibited a significant increase thereafter (8th week vs 15th week, p < 0.01), with symptoms persisting near peak levels. At 15th week, sneezing was significantly higher in C57BL/6 OVA mice compared to BALB/c OVA mice (p < 0.01) ( Fig. 2 Supplementary Table 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 (A) Trends in the number of sneezes at 0th week, 4th week to 15th week for each group.

In the C57BL/6 OVA group, OVA-specific IgE tended to increase with longer nasal drip time, sIgG1 peaked at 12th week and remained stable at 15th week, while IgG2a did not show significant changes throughout the course. Serum antibody concentrations were higher in the BALB/c OVA group than in the C57BL/6 OVA group at all time points ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Dynamics of OVA-specific antibody responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice following intranasal OVA challenge. Serum levels of IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies reflect the immunological response: IgE and IgG1 represent Th2-type immune responses, while IgG2a indicates a Th1-type immune response. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Sample size: n = 12 per group during the initial 8 weeks, subsequently reduced to n = 6 per group from the 9th to 15th week Fig. 3 Cytokines in splenic culture supernatants In the BALB/c OVA group, the concentrations of IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly higher in splenic culture supernatants at 8th week compared than in the BALB/c PBS group. The IL-4 concentration was lower and the IL-10 concentration was higher in the 15th BALB/c OVA group than in the 8th BALB/c OVA group. The concentrations of IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ were not changed in the C57BL/6 OVA group at 8th and 15th week compared to in the C57BL/6 PBS group ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Cytokines (IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-10) in splenocyte supernatants.

There was no significant difference in polymorphonuclear cell numbers between 8th BALB/c OVA group and 15th BALB/c OVA groups. A significant increase in polymorphonuclear cell number was observed in the 15th C57BL/6 OVA group compared to that in the 8th C57BL/6 OVA group. PAS results showed a significant increase in the number of nasal goblet cells in both the 8th BALB/c OVA group and the 8th C57BL/6 OVA group. There was a significant decrease in the goblet cell number in the 15th BALB/c OVA group compared with the 8th BALB/c OVA group, and a continued increase in goblet cells in the 15th C57BL/6 OVA group compared to the 8th C57BL/6 OVA group. At both time points of 8th week and 15th week, the number of goblet cells in the BALB/c OVA group was lower than that in the C57BL/6 OVA group ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Histopathological staining of mouse nasal mucosa.

There was an increasing trend in eotaxin expression in the 8th BALB/c OVA group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Eotaxin staining intensity was higher in C57BL/6 nasal mucosa than that in BALB/c mice at all time points ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Nasal mucosa immunohistochemistry.

TGF-β1 and IL-10 expression was significantly increased in the 15th BALB/c OVA group. In contrast, there was no significant increase in TGF-β1 and IL-10 expression in the C57BL/6 OVA group at any time point. ( Fig. 6 Nasal mucosal gene sequencing We have previously studied the genetic alterations in the nasal mucosa of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice in the 8th week. 2 When comparing the 15th BALB/c OVA group and the 15th C57BL/6 OVA group, there were 4299 differential genes, including 2354 upregulated genes and 1945 downregulated genes. GO-KEGG analysis showed that pathways of BALB/c mice were significantly enriched in the T-cell receptor signaling pathway, B-cell receptor signaling pathway, cytokine receptor interaction, TGF-β signaling pathway, Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway, TH1 and TH2 differentiation, and antigen presentation pathways. Pathways of C57BL/6 mice were significantly enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, ABC transporter protein, cAMP signaling pathway, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, amino acid biosynthesis, protein export, and RNA transport response pathway. GSEA results showed that BALB/c mice were significantly enriched in the TGF-β pathway and negatively regulated gene expression. We constructed a PPI network of differentially expressed genes between the 15th BALB/c OVA group and the 15th C57BL/6 OVA group, which generated 8848 nodes and 99525 edges, and obtained the top 10 HUB nodes: Rps27a, Uba52, Ubc, Kng2, Gnal, C3, Gng7, Gnb3, Reep5, and Reep6 ( Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Nasal mucosa transcriptomics.

BALB/c mice were found to develop local tolerance: nasal symptoms initially worsened and later improved; the systemic TH2 response was enhanced at first and weakened with time, and the Treg response was continuously enhanced. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice did not develop a local tolerance response even with the prolongation of nasal drip time, and the local symptoms and inflammatory response continued to worsen and remain at a high level; the systemic immune response only maintained a certain degree of TH2 response and the Treg response was not enhanced. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice are 2 inbred strains commonly used in immunological studies. Based on the cytokine production tendency, BALB/c mice are thought to favor TH2-type responses (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13), whereas C57BL/6 mice favor TH1-type responses (TNF-α and IFN-γ). 19 20 , 21 2 In this study, we observed that the concentrations of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a in BALB/c mice increased with the duration of nasal drip exposure. Conversely, in C57BL/6 mice, OVA-specific IgE levels rose over time, sIgG1 initially increased and then plateaued at the 12th week, while IgG2a levels remained unchanged throughout the entire course. Meanwhile, in BALB/c mice, the splenic culture supernatant results showed that IL-4 concentration increased at 8th week then decreased at 15th week, and IL-10 concentration continued to increase with longer nasal drip. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice showed no change in IL-4, IFN-γ, and IL-10 levels during the entire course of nasal OVA drip. These results suggest that when BALB/c mice were stimulated with a certain dose of allergen for a long time, their allergic reaction (TH2 function) was aggravated, but their TH1 and Treg functions also tended to increase with time and eventually suppressed TH2 function. In contrast, although the increase in serum sIgE (TH2 function) in C57BL/6 mice was lower than that in BALB/c mice, Treg function was not significantly enhanced with time, so the overall response was allergic. Some reports have focused on the immunity and tolerance between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. For example, Alan et al. found that BALB/c mice produced more specific antibodies than C57BL/6 mice and showed more significant tolerance to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. 4 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 In this study, we found that polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils and eosinophils are difficult to distinguish using HE staining alone; their differentiation mainly relies on morphological characteristics and additional markers. Based on other research findings, we speculate that these cells are likely eosinophils) and goblet cells increased in the nasal mucosa of BALB/c mice at 8th week, while the number of goblet cells decreased and the number of polymorphonuclear cells stopped increasing at 15th week. The expression of local IL-10 and TGF-β also increased over time, showing the characteristics of local tolerance. In C57BL/6 mice, local polymorphonuclear cells and goblet cells increased continuously from 8th week to 15th week, and eotaxin expression increased significantly. However, the local IL-10 and TGF-β levels did not change throughout the course. As IL-10 and TGF-β are important cytokines for immune tolerance, the lack of IL-10 and TGF-β may influence the formation of local tolerance. 30 Our previous research focused on comparing the gene expression profiles of the nasal mucosa in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice at week 8, during the peak of inflammation, following OVA stimulation. The results showed that, compared to BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice exhibited a significantly enhanced activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, particularly the JNK/MAPKK signaling pathway. 31 32 To further explore these differences, we constructed a PPI network based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the BALB/c and C57BL/6 OVA groups at week 15. The top 10 hub nodes identified include: ribosomal protein S27a (Rps27a), ubiquitin A-52 amino acid fusion protein (Uba52), ubiquitin C (Ubc), kininogen 2 (Kng2), cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit alpha (Gnal), complement component 3 (C3), cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit gamma 7 (Gng7), GNB3, receptor expression-enhancing protein 5 (Reep5), and Reep6.Recent reports have found that Rps27a is involved in protein synthesis, post-translational modification of proteins, and transcription of genes, and is highly expressed in tumor tissues such as breast fibroids, colorectal cancer and kidney. 33 , 34 35 , 36 37 38 39 , 40 + 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 While this study elucidates tolerance mechanisms in specific mouse strains, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitations of the mouse model. These limitations include differences in the immune systems between species, variations in nasal cavity anatomy, and the complexity of the immune environment—all of which are significantly less intricate than in humans. Consequently, these factors restrict the direct extrapolation of our findings to human conditions. Moreover, the long-term nasal drip model cannot fully replicate the multifactorial immune regulation and chronic disease states influenced by multiple factors in humans. This is partly because clinical allergen immunotherapy (AIT) employs standardized doses of allergens combined with adjuvants, whereas our model uses only a single antigen OVA without adjuvants. Additionally, human AIT is typically administered via subcutaneous or sublingual routes to induce systemic immune modulation, while the localized nasal delivery in mice mainly aims to mimic mucosal responses. These differences suggest that the immune tolerance mechanisms observed in specific mouse strains should not be directly generalized to human immunotherapy. Our conclusions should consider the study design. Sacrificing mice in the 8th and 15th weeks for tissue analysis reduced group sizes from 12 to 6 after 8th week. While enabling critical time-point analyses, the smaller sample in later phases may reduce sensitivity to detect longitudinal changes, particularly in symptom-variable C57BL/6 mice. However, key strain differences in tolerance (e.g., IL-10/TGF-β dynamics) showed strong effects (p < 0.01) and were confirmed by histology and RNA-seq. Larger terminal cohorts in future studies would strengthen these findings. Our study mainly monitored immune changes and clinical manifestations over 15 weeks; thus, we cannot exclude the possibility of late-phase symptoms. Future studies will extend observation periods to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic immune responses. Conclusion In summary, prolonged OVA exposure induces local tolerance in BALB/c mice but not in C57BL/6 mice, mainly due to strain-specific differences in Treg functionality. The tolerance observed in BALB/c mice is associated with dynamic upregulation of IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as negative regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways such as Wnt and JUN. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice fail to exhibit similar regulatory responses, leading to immune dysregulation. Our study enhances understanding of the systemic and local immune differences between these 2 strains and emphasizes the advantage of BALB/c mice in inducing Tregs, which aligns with the response characteristics seen in human AIT, confirming their utility in studying tolerance mechanisms. Conversely, C57BL/6 mice exhibit persistent inflammation, resembling severe, refractory human AR, which can be valuable for drug screening targeting difficult-to-treat conditions.
