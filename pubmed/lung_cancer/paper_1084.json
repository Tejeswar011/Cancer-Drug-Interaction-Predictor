There is emerging interest in leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for environmental epidemiology research. In this review, we provide an accessible overview of recent advances. Recent Findings There have been two major recent shifts in geospatial data types and analytic methods. First, novel methods for statistical prediction, combining geospatial analysis with machine learning and artificial intelligence (GeoAI), allow for scalable geospatial exposure assessment within large population health databases (e.g. cohorts, administrative claims). Second, the widespread adoption of smartphones and wearables with global positioning systems and other sensors has allowed for passive data collection from people, and when combined with geographic information systems, enables exposure assessment at finer spatial scales and temporal resolution than ever before. Illustrative examples include refining models for predicting outdoor air pollution exposure, characterizing populations susceptible to water pollution, and use of deep learning to classify Street View image-derived measures of greenspace. While these tools and approaches may facilitate more rapid, higher quality objective exposure measures, they pose challenges with respect to participant privacy, representativeness of collected data, and curation of high quality validation sets for training of GeoAI algorithms. Summary GeoAI approaches are beginning to be used for environmental exposure assessment and behavioral outcome ascertainment with higher spatial and temporal precision than before. Epidemiologists should continue to apply critical assessment of measurement accuracy and design validity when incorporating these new tools into their work.

The first is the growing practice of combining geospatial analyses using large administrative population and environmental monitoring databases and research cohorts with artificial intelligence-based statistical predictions, or “Geospatial Artificial Intelligence” (GeoAI), which can process and analyze large amounts of geospatial data at scale, reducing researcher time and effort [ 13 14 14 18 19 20 Box 1 Classifying and predicting environmental features using satellite-derived remote sensing: 21 22 23 24 25 Urban planning-related contextual environment: 26 27 28 29 Earth systems analysis: 30 31 32 33 Here, we describe the growing use of GeoAI for environmental epidemiologic exposure assessment and research. We then discuss how GeoAI applied to data from passive collection of health and behavioral data are capturing relevant exposures across an individual’s activity space, rather than just from their residence as was done in earlier eras. We discuss how geoAI approaches could contribute to recent advances in environmental epidemiologic methods and mixtures, along with ethical considerations required by investigators. Acquiring and Preparing Geospatial Data for GeoAI GeoAI approaches require high-quality input data. Because specific geospatial data sources and data types have already been reviewed extensively in the context of public health research [ 13 34 38 1 Table 1 Major geospatial data used for GeoAI research with US examples Data source What is collected Who collects Types of environmental or contextual factors Time period and frequency Spatial scale Example application of GeoAI with data source Quality considerations Example Administrative Disease registries, environmental monitoring, population demographics and economic factors Government (local, national) Socioeconomic factors (education, income, occupation), racial composition, poverty, air or water pollutants 1860-present Usually updated between 3–10 years US: census block group, census tract, ZIP code tabulation area, county Validate socioeconomic status measures estimated from Street View images of car make and model Error in self-reported information, uncertainty, missing or erroneous percentages, harmonization of boundaries over time National Census, American Community Survey, Demographic and Health Surveys Satellite-derived Remote sensing Satellite images, electromagnetic spectrum, aerosol optical depth Government (national) Land cover, greenspace, outdoor light at night, air pollution, aircraft imagery, building attributes, temperature US: 1985-present Usually updated annually Varies (30 m – 1 km are most common) Feature detection and forecasting using self-attention models, enhance low-resolution satellite images, learning from unlabeled data Accounting for surface reflectance, removing cloud cover, mosaics to stitch complete data Landsat, MODIS, Copernicus Street View Image Panoramic images taken along road networks Businesses and volunteers Greenspace, neighborhood disorder US: Varies (since 2007 for Google Street View) Point locations Classifying types of green space as perceived by people walking May only be collected at a single time point, Google Street View, Baidu, Mapillary (crowdsourced) Administrative, satellite-derived remote sensing, and street view data are major sources of geospatial data available to environmental epidemiologists to characterize exposures. These sources are attractive for use in GeoAI because they offer extensive geographic coverage, raw data often are available at fine (< 1 km) spatial scales, and data are available over a long period of time (over twenty years in many cases) with annual or more frequent updates. Given the granularity of spatial and temporal data offered, these databases capture enormous variation in place-based characteristics that can be exploited for GeoAI methods to characterize social, built environment, and pollution exposures [ 16 39 42 Prior to applying GeoAI methods using these data sources, researchers should reflect on the completeness and accuracy of information contained therein. In addition, predictors may need to be normalized or transformed before applying GeoAI algorithms [ 43 46 47 48 Researchers should also assess the appropriateness of a given geospatial database for their GeoAI study based on how data were sampled. Government, business, and volunteer-based sampling offer strengths and weaknesses in terms of coverage and precision. While government databases offer complete coverage of a population of interest, errors related to reporting and completeness may be more likely. Businesses may offer higher quality data, but may be smaller in scale and more costly to access. Volunteer-based data sources may offer more granularity than either businesses or government, particularly for select populations or geographies, but lack generalizability. Thus, epidemiologists should exercise judgment regarding the internal and external validity of input data sources and quality when determining an appropriate geospatial data source to use in a GeoAI algorithm [ 49 Narrative Review Methods Our goal in this narrative review was to provide the reader with an overview of key concepts and emerging trends in the use of GeoAI in environmental epidemiologic and exposure assessment research, rather than providing a comprehensive review. We began by identifying papers in the past three years that applied deep learning and mobile phone-based big data approaches for assessing relationships between residential environment, pollutants, and lifestyles in clinical, cancer, and environmental health journals. We began with a focus on cancer because the use of geospatial analysis approaches has been a major research and funding priority by the US federal government in recent years [ 50 In order to supplement our initial search, we obtained a list of peer-reviewed journal articles covering topics relevant to GeoAI and environmental health from PubMed using the “Advanced Search” tool with the search terms (geospatial artificial intelligence health) AND (environment), restricting to English language studies only. We then screened paper titles and abstracts to confirm that papers included in the review focused on environmental exposure assessment, human health, and application of statistical methods that incorporated spatial analysis and Machine learning or artificial intelligence-based methods to predict exposure, health outcomes, or relationships between the two. We excluded studies that were out of scope, reviews, abstracts, or did not focus on relevance to Human Health. Of 85 results, 43 were ultimately retained. This keyword search was complemented by snowball sampling of articles cited in references. These retained papers are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 2 GeoAI Combined with Big Data for Environmental Exposure Assessment For most environmental exposures, individual-level exposure measurement would be prohibitively expensive in large populations over long time periods. GeoAI is well-suited for exposure prediction, as it integrates spatial modeling and theory with large datasets and predictive algorithms to estimate where and for whom environmental exposures might pose the greatest risk or greatest benefit. When trained with high quality, representative data, deep learning algorithms can accelerate the laborious task of exposure assessment [ 51 53 7 1 Fig. 1 Offers a visual illustration of how GeoAI and Big Data sources are beginning to be used to advance environmental exposure assessment Enhancing Predictions of Ambient Air Pollution Air pollution has been a major focus of GeoAI exposure modeling for environmental exposure assessments in epidemiologic studies [ 43 48 54 68 69 70 71 57 59 46 1 2.5 72 Using GeoAI offers potential benefits over classical methods for air pollution prediction. First, these methods are able to account for complex characteristics of atmospheric mechanisms, including nonlinearity, interactions, and spatial and temporal autocorrelation [ 73 43 56 63 2.5 2 73 76 2.5 77 78 Di et al. (2016) developed a neural network-based hybrid model integrating satellite-derived remote sensing data on aerosol optical depth (AOD), chemical transport model outputs, land use, and meteorological variables [ 73 2.5 2.5 74 2.5 75 2.5 2.5 2.5 76 Relatedly, accurate, reliable predictions of wildfire smoke (or extreme weather and climate events at large [ 79 80 81 82 Augmenting Prediction of Drinking Water-Based Contaminants and Communities at Risk GeoAI has also been used to estimate water quality, contaminants, and pesticides, enabling population-level estimates of exposed populations [ 45 83 90 91 92 93 GeoAI has also been used to identify areas where contamination is most likely to occur. Emerging contaminants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pose significant challenges for drinking water management and provision and health [ 94 96 97 k Even long-term regulated contaminants like lead present significant monitoring challenges [ 98 99 past 100 101 Improving Built Environment, Greenspace and Pollutant Exposures Using Satellite-Derived Remote Sensing Satellite imagery captures a variety of information, including visible features of land (built environment, settlements, greenspace) and atmospheric elements (chemical composition of atmosphere, spectral bands of light). The breadth of built and contextual environmental factors captured can, when combined with GeoAI methods, allow for improved disease prediction and inference regarding drivers of morbidity in different geographic settings [ 62 64 102 108 An important application of these Big Data satellite instruments is to study potential impacts of exposures to nature (e.g., spending time in forests and parks) and health [ 109 111 112 113 114 115 116 Sentinel satellite data on air pollutants offers scientists in resource-limited settings with relatively weaker governmental regulation of environmental air pollutants to monitor changes in pollution associated with health outcomes. For example, studies in India [ 117 118 Detecting Street-Level Features of the Natural and Built Environment While use of satellite-derived exposures has advanced the study of environmental exposures and health, they may not accurately reflect an individual’s interaction with their environment [ 119 107 120 123 124 124 125 Street-level environmental exposure assessment through deep learning applied to street-level images have been used to study health effects of visible greenspace. For example, Yi et al. examined associations of different street-view greenspace components with adiposity measures (landscaping items such as flowers and plants) and cardiovascular health (trees), respectively, in Project Viva children—an eastern Massachusetts-based cohort [ 125 126 127 128 129 130 Novel Big Data Sources for Acquiring Population Health Behavior Data Passive Data Collection to Describe, Map, and Predict Environmental Burden Low-cost personal PM 2.5 131 43 132 133 134 Consumer Wearable Devices, and Smartphones for passive Health Behavior Data Collection Researchers are merging spatial datasets with accelerometry and consumer wearable devices, which allow high temporal resolution (e.g., 50 measures per second), objective data on movement, and other data streams, including light sensors and heart rate sensors [ 135 136 137 138 2 Fig. 2 Traditional vs “Big Data” Cohort Design Alongside research-grade accelerometry and consumer wearables, widespread use of smartphones has provided another opportunity for intensive data collection schemes, which an increasing number of studies have started using [ 139 141 142 143 146 147 148 Analyzing Social Media to Assess Responses to Environmental Hazards The integration of online data sources, including social media and other digital platforms, can provide real-time insights into environmental and health-related exposures [ 65 149 150 151 152 153 154 Beyond X, Google search queries provide real-time assessments of health trends. Sadilek et al. (2020) demonstrated that Google search trends could predict Lyme Disease outbreaks, achieving a 92% correlation with CDC case data at the county level [ 155 156 157 Natural language processing and AI algorithms can be applied to social media and other text databases to serve as new sources of environmental exposure data [ 158 159 Applications of GeoAI for Data Analysis and Interpretation Handling Spatially Correlated Data Geospatial data often exhibit spatial autocorrelation whereby observations that are closer to each other are more similar than those that are further away [ 160 161 When applying GeoAI algorithms for exposure assessment, spatial dependence of input predictors can be encoded into the algorithms themselves, referred to as “spatial embedding or spatial representation learning” [ 162 2.4 163 164 165 166 163 Spatial dependence poses challenges to potential outcomes-based causal inference. Environmental epidemiologic studies relying on spatially-derived exposures are susceptible to unmeasured spatial confounding [ 167 168 163 169 170 Analyzing Complex Exposure Mixtures, Exposomics The exposome is defined as the totality of environmental exposures across the life course [ 5 171 172 173 Mixture modeling provides methods to study the independent and aggregate effects of environmental exposures [ 174 176 177 176 178 181 182 183 183 184 185 Challenges for exposomics studies, which can examine a large number of environmental exposures, include the lack of standardized approaches for selecting geospatial exposure models for a given environmental factor [ 175 186 187 Interpreting Model Parameters and Feature Importance Most epidemiologic investigations seek to make inferences regarding what factors are most important or may cause the outcome of interest. A limitation of AI approaches is that the parameters used to predict exposures or outcomes are less interpretable than standard regression-based approaches [ 161 45 46 54 57 58 67 85 149 188 Challenges and Limitations when Applying GeoAI for Environmental Epidemiology Spatial and Temporal Issues GeoAI tools may excel at predicting environmental phenomena relative to traditional methods, but cannot produce a conceptual model for an epidemiologic relationship with a given environmental exposure. Epidemiologists and exposure scientists must provide guidance regarding the physical and pathological processes that link exposure to outcomes. This requires scientists to continue considering the core principles of time, place, and population when designing epidemiologic studies. Because environmental exposures and related spatial phenomena are so context-dependent, GeoAI algorithms are likely to perform poorly when applied in different geographic settings and different time periods as argued by Goodchild and Li [ 161 55 57 84 189 190 With respect to geographic context, statistical relationships between spatially defined exposures and outcomes are sensitive to the choice of spatial scale, referred to as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem [ 191 192 193 Ethical Issues Verifying input data quality for GeoAI is essential, because without human interpretation, decisions made by AI models may Yield unexpected or unwanted outcomes. A recent review of 91 Machine learning algorithms for clinical care, 87% reported bias for a socioeconomically disadvantaged group [ 194 195 196 197 An assessment of the “bias and fairness” of the algorithm should be included when reporting results. These measures go beyond standard assessments of statistical accuracy such as calibration (how accurate predictions are with respect to observed exposures) and discrimination (how well the classifier algorithm separates exposed vs unexposed). Specifically, evaluations of fairness for AI algorithms reveal for whom algorithms provide more accurate vs less accurate predictions with respect to sociodemographic characteristics. Evaluating accuracy, positive and negative predictive values, and true and false positive rates across different groups can ensure that exposure assessment models are not inadvertently biased [ 55 195 198 199 Another ethical consideration of GeoAI-based exposure assessment relates to privacy and confidentiality. Federal regulations strongly restrict access to residential addresses for research because they may identify individual patients. However, displacement of geocodes by introducing random “noise” (geomasking), has been shown to reduce disclosure risks [ 200 201 202 203 Measurement Error Measurement error is a common source of bias in geospatial health studies, which occurs due to inaccuracies in geocoding [ 204 205 141 55 206 207 208 Conclusion In summary, GeoAI offers exciting opportunities to improve exposure assessment and analysis for environmental epidemiology research. When combined with existing administrative, street view, or satellite data, GeoAI allows efficient exposure assessment and prediction for settings that have previously been difficult or costly to capture, such as perceived built environment and water contamination. GeoAI can also be integrated with passively collected data from wearable devices and high resolution GPS tracking to characterize exposures occurring beyond a participant’s residence, reducing measurement error. Lastly, GeoAI may improve performance of novel mixtures-based analysis approaches, and augment methods to correct for study biases. Alongside the promise offered by GeoAI, researchers should consider potential issues arising from poor quality training data, the timing and spatial coverage of training data and its relevance to the population of interest, and the need to maintain privacy and confidentiality when using participant address information.
