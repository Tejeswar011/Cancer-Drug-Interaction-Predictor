Methods This study included 3,553 participants aged ≥ 65 years from the 2008–2020 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Dietary data were collected through 24-hour recall interviews by trained researchers, and demographic and lifestyle information via self-administered questionnaires. HRQoL was measured using a modified EQ-5D scale. Multivariable linear regression analyzed the associations between EQ-5D scores, nutrients and comorbidity, controlling for sociodemographic and health variables. Results Most participants reported ‘no problems’ in the EQ-5D scores, although approximately 17% to 47% of participants reported ‘some problems’ or ‘extreme problems,’ depending on the dimension. As comorbidities increased, significant declines were observed across all dimensions, particularly in mobility, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Nutrient intake analysis revealed that participants with three or more comorbidities consumed less carbohydrates, but more fat. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that among older adults with T2DM, a higher number of comorbidities is associated with decreased HRQoL. Additionally, there are differences in nutrient intake patterns among those with more comorbidities, specifically decreased carbohydrate intake and increased fat intake. These results emphasize the need for comprehensive and tailored management strategies that consider both diabetes and the co-occurring health conditions. By addressing the complex healthcare needs of individuals with multiple comorbidities, it is possible to enhance their HRQoL and overall well-being. quality of life diabetes mellitus, type 2 comorbidity aged Korea pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes INTRODUCTION Recent years have witnessed accelerated aging of populations worldwide, including that of South Korea [ 1 2 3 7 8 In the context of an aging population and the escalating burden of chronic diseases, diabetes has become a critical global challenge for healthcare systems. This is directly associated with the increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide and is acknowledged as a significant public health concern among aging populations. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that the global prevalence of diabetes among older people aged 65 and over at 43 million in 2021, and reports that it will double by 2045 [ 9 10 Patients with diabetes require continuous management of various aspects of their daily lives, including diet, exercise, and medication adherence for blood sugar control [ 11 12 13 14 18 The elderly population, particularly those aged 65 and older, presents unique challenges and considerations. As individuals age, they are more likely to develop multiple comorbidities, which complicates diabetes management and exacerbates the decline in quality of life [ 19 20 21 Previous studies investigating the associations between comorbidities and HRQoL were primarily conducted in local hospitals during the 2010s [ 22 24 25 26 27 22 23 24 Therefore, this study aimed to analyze HRQoL in relation to the number of comorbidities among Korean T2DM patients aged 65 years and older, utilizing data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey (KNHANES). The findings from this research are expected to offer valuable insights for the development of targeted nutritional and therapeutic interventions, with the ultimate goal of improving diabetes management and enhancing the overall well-being of South Korea’s aging population. METHODS  Ethics statement The data utilized in this study, derived from the KNHANES for the years 2008–2020, were collected with informed consent from all participants. For the periods 2008–2014 and 2018–2020, the research received approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (IRB approval numbers: 2008-04EXP-01-C, 2009-01CON-03-2C, 2010-02CON-21-C, 2011-02CON-06-C, 2012-01EXP-01-2C, 2013-07CON-03-4C, 2013-12EXP-03-5C, and 2014-12EXP-03-5C). Data from 2015–2017 were exempted from ethical review, as determined by the Research Ethics Review Committee of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) [ 28 1. Study design This study is a cross-sectional analysis and has been reported in accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines ( https://www.strobe-statement.org/ 2. Study population KNHANES is a nationwide health and nutrition survey conducted since 1998 under the National Health Promotion Act [ 28 28 28 From a total of 108,497 participants in the KNHANES between 2008 and 2020, the following were excluded from the analysis: 1) individuals under 65 years of age (n = 87,549); 2) those with missing relevance analysis weights (n = 2,357); 3) individuals who were not diagnosed with or were unaware of having T2DM (n = 14,892); and 4) respondents who did not complete the EQ-5D questionnaire (n = 146). Consequently, 3,553 individuals were included in the primary analysis ( Fig. 1 All data included in this study were collected with informed consent from participants and this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the KDCA (approval numbers: 2008-04EXP-01-C, 2009-01CON-03-2C, 2010-02CON-21-C, 2011-02CON-06-C, 2012-01EXP-01-2C, 2013-07CON-03-4C, 2013-12EXP-03-5C, 2018-01-03-P-A, 2018-01-03-C-A, 2018-01-03-2C-A, and 2018-01-03-3C-A). According to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Bioethics Law, and Paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the Enforcement Rule of the same law, the KNHANES is classified as research conducted directly by the state for public welfare. Consequently, from 2015 to 2017, the study was conducted without a separate ethical review as per the advice of the Ethics Committee of the KDCA [ 28 3. Demographic and lifestyle information Data on age, sex, education level, monthly household income, employment status, and household composition were obtained through interviews with trained investigators. Data on body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, type of diabetes treatment, and duration of diabetes were collected using self-reported health questionnaires [ 28 2 2 2 2 29 30 The dietary survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews with trained investigators who visited the participants’ homes. Information on the food consumed on the previous day was collected using the 24-hour recall method [ 28 1 2 31 4. Definition of T2DM and comorbidities In this study, the participants were defined as patients with T2DM who were aware of their condition. They were identified based on 1) self-reported health questionnaires in which they responded to having been diagnosed by a doctor, 2) currently suffering from T2DM, and 3) undergoing treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin therapy, or diet/exercise regimens. To elucidate the association between comorbid chronic diseases and HRQoL in patients with T2DM, this study explicitly defined several chronic diseases as comorbidities. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, myocardial infarction/angina, renal failure, and cancer were included as comorbidities [ 32 5. Health-related quality of life In this study, HRQoL in older patients with T2DM was analyzed based on the level of comorbidities and dietary patterns using the EQ-5D, an HRQoL measurement tool provided by KNHANES [ 28 33 5 33 The composite EQ-5D index was calculated using quality-of-life weights provided by the KDCA [ 34 6. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted considering the weights, strata, and primary sampling units of the complex sample design of the KNHANES. To analyze the general characteristics and lifestyle habits of older patients with T2DM, categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, and significance was tested using the chi-squared test. Analysis of the mean EQ-5D scores and calorie nutrient intake based on the number of comorbidities was conducted using multivariate linear regression, presenting the means and standard errors. To compare the adjusted means between groups, analysis of covariance and Tukey post-hoc test were conducted. Confounding variables were selected based on a review of previous studies and preliminary analyses [ 35 38 P All statistical processing in this study was conducted using SAS 9.4 version (statistical analysis system; SAS Institute), and statistical significance was tested at the α = 0.05 level. RESULTS 1. General characteristics and lifestyle factors according to the level of comorbidities The general characteristics and lifestyle factors of the participants were compared and analyzed according to the number of comorbidities ( Table 1 P P P P 2.

AMDR levels of participants according to the level of comorbidities Table 5 P DISCUSSION In older Korean patients with T2DM, an increase in comorbidities was associated with a notable decline in quality of life across all domains of the EQ-5D. Overall EQ-5D index scores also demonstrated a downward trend with more comorbidities. Nutrient intake patterns shifted as comorbidities increased, with a decrease in carbohydrate consumption and an increase in fat intake. The findings of our study provide new insights and reinforce the conclusions drawn from previous studies. A meta-analysis identified factors affecting the quality of life in diabetic patients, highlighting comorbidities, hypertension, duration of diabetes, and a diet high in red meat as significant factors [ 27 26 39 40 41 Although our study focused specifically on older adults with T2DM, comparing our findings to those from healthy populations could offer valuable insights. Previous literature suggests that comorbidities negatively impact HRQoL in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, though the extent of the decline may differ. Healthy adults, for instance, may not experience as steep a reduction in HRQoL as their comorbidities increase, since managing diabetes and its complications adds an additional burden for those with the disease. While direct comparisons with healthy adults were not within the scope of this research, future studies should investigate these differences more thoroughly. Such comparisons would help illuminate the unique challenges faced by older adults with T2DM and multiple comorbidities, providing a clearer understanding of how comorbidities affect HRQoL across different populations. Building on previous findings, our study adds a unique perspective on the role of nutrition in managing T2DM in older adults. Research on Filipino-American adults suggests that patients over 65 with T2DM may be more adept at reducing carbohydrate intake compared to younger individuals [ 42 43 44 Additionally, our study revealed an alarming trend: sodium intake among all participants was more than double the recommended amount, regardless of comorbidity level. In contrast, the mean sodium intake in the general Korean elderly population without diabetes was reported to be 2,920 mg in 2020 and 2,837 mg in 2019, which is lower than the intake observed in our sample [ 45 46 One of the key strengths of our study is its focus on older Korean patients with T2DM, a demographic often underrepresented in diabetes research. By examining the associations between comorbidities, nutrient intake, and quality of life, our study provides valuable insights into the unique health challenges faced by elderly Korean diabetics. Using data from the large, nationally representative KNHANES sample, we ensured that our findings are robust and applicable to this population. The use of EQ-5D scores allowed us to capture the impact of multiple comorbidities on various dimensions of daily living. Additionally, our study draws attention to critical dietary issues, such as the high sodium intake prevalent among older Koreans, emphasizing the need for culturally appropriate dietary interventions to improve health outcomes. Limitation Nevertheless, our study is not without limitations. First, while confounding factors were progressively adjusted based on a review of previous literature and a preliminary analysis comparing the quality of life among older patients with T2DM with different numbers of comorbidities, there remains the possibility of residual confounding due to unmeasured or unknown potential confounders. For example, the severity of T2DM, treatment type, and management efficacy were not adjusted for in the present study. This oversight might lead to residual confounding as these factors can affect the HRQoL of patients. Additionally, while we considered analyzing the type of comorbidities, the small sample size in subgroups with multiple overlapping conditions made it difficult to conduct robust statistical analyses. As a result, we focused on the number of comorbidities rather than specific types, which could limit the depth of our analysis regarding how different comorbidity types impact HRQoL. Second, as the study analyzed the KNHANES data from to 2008–2020, its cross-sectional nature limited its ability to establish causal relationships between causes and outcomes. For instance, it is challenging to prove a direct causal relationship between higher number of comorbidities in older patients with T2DM and lower HRQoL scores observed in the study. Various intermediary factors between comorbidity levels and low HRQoL may be involved; however, these factors may not completely account for the observed relationship. Therefore, the study results provide preliminary insights into the association between comorbidities and HRQoL. Finally, the study relied on self-reported data, which may have been subject to subjective biases. In particular, there could be errors in information such as dietary records, physical activity levels, and medical history. Conclusion Our study demonstrates a multifaceted relationship between comorbidities, diet, and HRQoL in Korean patients over 65 years of age with T2DM. We observed that an increase in the number of comorbidities correlated with a decline in HRQoL. Notably, different patterns in nutrient intake, such as reduced carbohydrate consumption and increased fat intake, were associated with varying comorbidity levels. These findings underscore the need for national health policies and support systems that focus on both medical treatments and nutritional care. Further large-scale prospective cohort studies and clinical trials are essential to deepen our understanding of these relationships and develop comprehensive management strategies to improve the quality of life for older diabetic patients in Korea.
