Background Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty was introduced to Japan in 2014, principally to treat cuff tear arthropathy and irreparable massive rotator cuff tears. Its indications have expanded significantly worldwide since then. This study aimed to analyze the annual trends in shoulder arthroplasties and rotator cuff repairs (RCRs) from 2014 to 2022 and to examine differences by sex and age group using a publicly available national database. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in Japan. The surgical categories analyzed included shoulder arthroplasty and RCR between 2014 and 2022. The annual number of surgeries was reported according to sex and age group. Age-specific incidence was calculated per 100,000 people using age group population data. Descriptive statistics and the independent t Results Shoulder arthroplasties increased dramatically from 1,246 in 2014 to 5,439 in 2022. From 2014 to 2022, the number of RCRs did not decrease; in fact, they continued to increase steadily from 17,553 to 21,183, except for a dip in 2020. Shoulder arthroplasties were nearly twice as common in females, whereas RCRs were more frequent in males. Shoulder arthroplasties peaked in the 75-79 age group, with an average age of 78 years, whereas RCRs were most frequent in the 70-74 age group, averaging 67 years. Discussion and Conclusion Despite the substantial increase in shoulder arthroplasties, the number of RCRs has also slightly increased. These findings demonstrate that reverse total shoulder arthroplasty did not simply replace RCRs but complement conventional RCR in the treatment spectrum of shoulder disorders. The findings indicated that females had a higher prevalence of shoulder arthroplasty procedures, whereas males were more likely to undergo RCR. In addition, the patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty tended to be older than those who underwent RCR. These observations may be attributed to sex-specific differences in the progression of shoulder conditions and the accessibility of various treatment approaches or possibly a difference in indications for surgery in females and males. This study demonstrated substantial increases in shoulder arthroplasties in Japan over the past decade, with notable differences in age and sex distributions compared with conventional RCR.

We also examined differences by sex and age group to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape of RCT surgeries in Japan. We hypothesized that the advent of rTSA has substantially altered treatment options for RCTs, affecting not only the frequency of arthroplasty procedures but also RCR. Methods Study design We conducted a retrospective study using the following 2 databases. We mainly used the NDB Open Data Japan, public data with compiled claims information, operated by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in Japan. 26 12 Data collection Data were retrieved from the NDB Open Data Japan website for 2014-2022. We used Microsoft Excel files titled “Number of calculations by division, sex, and age group” under “Surgery (code K). The numbers of outpatient and inpatient surgeries were summed for each year. We included 1) shoulder arthroplasty and 2) RCR as surgeries for RCT. Humerus head replacement (hemi shoulder arthroplasty), removal of arthroplasty, revision of arthroplasty, and arthroplasty for joints other than the shoulder were excluded. Finally, we extracted data for the following surgical procedures ( Table I 1) Total shoulder arthroplasty • Arthroplasty (code K082) 2) RCR • RCR (code K080-3), • Arthroscopic RCR (code K080-4). Table I Associated surgical codes used in this study. Surgical code Classification Specification K080-3 Rotator cuff repair Simple Complex K080-4 Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair Simple Complex K082 Arthroplasty Arthroplasty (shoulder) Rotator cuff repair includes cuff tear repair regardless of additional procedures, such as tenotomy and tenodesis of the long head of the biceps, but does not include only débridement, synovectomy, acromioplasty, and bursectomy. Complex rotator cuff repair is defined as the procedure that is performed for cuff tears of 5 cm or more, involving fascia transplantation or muscle transfer, superior capsular reconstruction, patch replacement, and muscle advancement. Both categories of RCR surgery include simple and complex procedures. In general, RCR includes cuff tear repair regardless of additional procedures, such as tenotomy and tenodesis of the long head of the biceps but does not include only débridement, synovectomy, acromioplasty, and bursectomy. Complex RCRs are defined as procedures that are performed for cuff tears of 5 cm or more, involving fascia transplantation or muscle transfer, superior capsular reconstruction, patch replacement, and muscle advancement. In NDB Open Data Japan, shoulder arthroplasty combines both anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) and rTSA. To distinguish between rTSA and aTSA, we extracted data from the annual report of the replacement arthroplasty national registry published on the JSRA website. 12 Data analysis For each surgical procedure, shoulder arthroplasty and RCR, we extracted the following: • Total annual numbers: The total number of surgeries performed yearly from 2014 to 2022. • Annual numbers by sex: The number of surgeries performed annually stratified by sex (male and female). • Annual numbers by age group: The number of surgeries performed annually, categorized into 5-year age intervals (eg, 50-54 and 55-59 years). Age-specific incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of surgeries in each age group by the 2015 Japan Standard Population, based on the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications website data. 33 , 39 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and identify the annual trends in surgical procedures. The number of surgeries between the surgical types (shoulder arthroplasty vs RCR, open RCR vs arthroscopic RCR, and simple RCR vs complex RCR) were compared using independent t t 31 t Results Annual number of surgeries According to the NDB Open Data Japan, the number of shoulder arthroplasties increased dramatically each year from 1,246 in 2014 to 5,439 in 2022, more than fourfold (annual increase: 531 surgeries; 95% CIs: 530-532).

Figure 7 Changes in the incidence of the surgery in the Japanese population between 2014 and 2022. The solid line circle graphs dotted line square graphs Orange green pink blue Discussion This nationwide analysis of shoulder surgery trends in Japan from 2014 to 2022 reveals 2 main findings. First, shoulder arthroplasty procedures demonstrated a substantial rise, more than quadrupling throughout the period. This was predominantly due to the increase in utilization of rTSA. Secondly, this increase in rTSA was not reflected by a decrease in RCR surgeries. The annual number of RCR surgeries, including primary repairs and joint-preserving procedures, steadily increased during the same time frame, while the proportion of complex RCR procedures showed a decreasing trend over this period. Taken together, these findings suggest 2 things. The first is that the indications for rTSA expanded after its introduction in Japan to conditions beyond cuff tear arthropathy and irreparable massive cuff tears. This has been recognized elsewhere in the world, where rTSA is becoming preferred over aTSA for revision arthroplasty, 34 29 32 The second implication is that the steady increase in RCR, particularly simple RCR, aligns with global trends and probably reflects advancements in minimally invasive surgical techniques, improved patient outcomes, and increased surgeon proficiency and training. 13 , 15 , 44 Several factors may explain the observed trends. Japan presents a unique scenario due to the delayed approval of rTSA until 2014, in contrast to the United States and Europe, where rTSA has been widely adopted since the early 2000s. Katano et al analyzed the trends in arthroplasty in Japan between 2014 and 2017, including joints other than the shoulder. 14 The sustained increase in rTSA likely stems from its proven efficacy in treating cuff tear arthropathy and irreparable RCT, which are more prevalent in the aging population. Japan's aging demographic, with a growing elderly population, may contribute to the increased demand for arthroplasty. 23 Another important finding of this study is related to sex differences in surgical procedure distribution. We found that RCR was consistently performed more frequently in males, accounting for 57% of all procedures. This finding was consistent with the study by Li et al, who also found that 57% of RCR was performed in males. 19 11 , 46 7 , 48 In contrast, the distribution of patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty procedures was higher in females (70%) than in males (30%). In addition, patients treated with shoulder arthroplasties (78 years) were generally older than those undergoing RCR (67 years). These results are consistent with that of Petel et al, who found that 59% of patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty in the United States were female and significantly older than males. 30 37 , 41 Our findings reveal a markedly lower incidence of RCR and shoulder arthroplasty in Japan compared to other countries. In the United States, RCR incidence per 100,000 people was 165 between 2007 and 2016 and is increasing. 47 36 43 8 21 35 , 45 38 27 24 28 Our findings suggest that the introduction of rTSA in Japan has broadened the surgical options for managing severe shoulder conditions, such as RCTs and shoulder arthropathy, especially in elderly patients. Clinicians can use these data to better inform patients of their surgical options, particularly when conservative or joint-preserving treatments fail. The remarkable growth in rTSA procedures, supported by encouraging clinical results in a diverse patient demographic and various conditions, is becoming a reliable alternative for appropriate patients. This study has several limitations. First, this study relies on publicly available national data, which does not include detailed patient-specific information such as comorbidities, surgical outcomes, or postoperative recovery. Also, fewer than 10 surgical procedures are masked to secure patients' anonymity so that the numbers could be more accurate. In terms of age-specific incidence, the result of this study may be influenced by the aging trend in Japan. The higher life expectancy of females may also be relevant. In addition, the NDB Open Data Japan include both rTSA and aTSA in shoulder arthroplasty. Although the annual report of the JSRA can distinguish between rTSA and aTSA, there was a significant discrepancy between the JSRA report and the actual NDB open data from 2016 to 2019. It is thought that the JSRA report during this period did not entirely reflect the exact number reported by orthopedic surgeons. Finally, although the increase in rTSA coincides with a decrease in complex RCR surgeries, suggesting a correlation, we could not calculate the specific percentage of rTSA performed due to RCT-derived conditions. As a result, the observed trend may overestimate the actual impact of rTSA on the number of complex RCR procedures. However, since the JSRA annual report states that 58%-69% of diagnoses of rTSA surgeries were due to irreparable RCT or cuff tear arthropathy, it is reasonable to assume that more than half of shoulder arthroplasty surgeries were consistently RCT-derived. 12 Conclusion This study showed that shoulder arthroplasty increased dramatically over the 9 years from 2014 to 2022 following the introduction of rTSA in Japan, while RCR increased steadily but at a much lower rate. This study also revealed that shoulder arthroplasty was more common among females, RCR was more common among males, and the mean age at surgery was higher for shoulder arthroplasty than for RCR. These findings highlight the importance of shoulder arthroplasty, including rTSA, in expanding treatment options for complex shoulder disorders, particularly among older patients, while affirming the continued relevance of RCR.
