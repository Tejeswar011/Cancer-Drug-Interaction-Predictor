Single cell sequencing lacks sensitivity and requires disruptive tissue digestion techniques. TRAP seq (Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) or “RiboTag” has been used to overcome these limitations. Multicellular co-culture systems allow primary ECs to differentiate and undergo tubular morphogenesis in cell culture, however similar limitations exist with these in vitro assays, as ECs are under-represented by as much as a factor of 10 in many assays. We sought to use TRAP seq to better understand the gene expression landscapes that drive these morphogenic events. We found TRAP seq selectively enriches for endothelial RNA in two distinct co-culture paradigms, in both the planar and fibrin bead co-culture assays. Intriguingly, the use of this technology in vitro, revealed distinct gene expression changes in blood vessel development and in the mitotic cell cycle, with genes unique to early and late phases of morphogenesis. It is widely accepted that expression of the NOTCH signaling pathway is a regulator of angiogenesis in vivo. Correspondingly, we found that many NOTCH related genes relevant to endothelial cell biology, were changing across this morphogenic process, underpinning the importance and utility of this technology in 3D multicellular cultures that model in vivo environments.

We sought to use TRAP seq to study changes in the endothelial translatome during 3D in vitro morphogenesis in co-culture assays. Our data reveal dynamic changes in the endothelial cell translatome following three-dimensional co-culture, particularly in genes involved in mitogenesis and blood vessel development. We also found a marked downregulation of cellular proliferation early in the process and a vast number of genes in the NOTCH signaling pathway that are being dynamically regulated throughout morphogenesis. Results Generation of a lentiviral vector harboring Rpl22-3X-HA and its use in 3D co-culture of HUVECs Low passage primary endothelial cells infected with lentivirus maintain full differentiation capability, thus we sought to create a lentiviral vector to deliver an appropriate ribosomal tagged construct. As a commercially available mouse model (Jackson, Strain #:029977) is available and has been used with success to study ECs 14 17 ( 1 ) ( 1 ) 1 1 ( 1 ) ( 1 ). 4 8 Fig. 1 Generation of a lentiviral vector harboring Rpl22-3X-HA and its use in a 3D co-culture of HUVECs. a b Created in BioRender. King, S. (2025 https://BioRender.com/s68o534 c Due to the dramatic morphological changes that occur between days 1, 4, and 8, we decided to target those time points for RNA isolation in our TRAP seq experiments designed to better define the transcriptomic changes occurring during this morphogenic process. As biological variability is a factor when using primary cells, experiments were conducted using 4 independent pools of primary HUVECs from two different commercial vendors, each pool representing at least three donors of mixed races and sexes. To ensure representative numbers of endothelial and fibroblast mRNAs in the 2D endothelial samples, identical numbers of endothelial and fibroblasts were plated separately at the same time and media as the co-culture assays and were lysed in a common fraction of lysis buffer. A complete outline of the experimental scheme is shown in Supplemental Figure 1 and normalized counts are available in Supplemental Table 1. TRAP seq effectively enriches endothelial cell mRNA in the planar co-culture assay of morphogenesis Co-culture samples infected with the Rpl22-3X-HA coding lentivirus were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA beads following 8 days in co-culture. These IP RNA samples were compared to input RNA samples (no immunoprecipitation), containing an enrichment with fibroblast cells by approximately tenfold, based on plating density. As anticipated, we found significant differences in gene expression between input and IP samples ( 2 ). ( 2 ) ( 2 ). ( 2 ) Fig. 2 RiboTag provides significant enrichment of endothelial cell transcripts from the 3D planar co-culture. a b c d We next wanted to extend the study to another 3D in vitro morphogenesis assay to validate TRAP was effective in isolating RNA from a more complex and technically challenging assay. In this alternative assay, originally described by the Hughes lab 5 2 TRAP seq of 3D co-culture of HUVECs reveals distinct biological processes involved with morphogenesis over time An objective of these studies is to investigate the change in EC gene expression in 3D co-cultures that are permissive for morphogenesis compared to traditional 2D culture of HUVECs. We found HUVECs cultured alone in 2D versus cultured in the 3D model with fibroblasts, had a substantial number of differentially expressed genes after 24 h (Supplemental Figure 3a and 3b). Confirming what we observed visually in the co-cultures, gene ontology analysis of DEGs found various biological processes changing with 3D culture such as, cell migration and vasculature development (Supplemental Figure 3c). To this point, we observed several genes (e.g. CXCR4, KDR, DLL4, and UNC5B) critical for migration and tip cell specification enriched at this early time point (Supplemental Figure 3d), while other genes, showed marked down regulation, including SOX4, JAG1, CCN2, and PDGFB (Supplemental Figure 3e). The downregulated genes at 24 h were enriched in the GO term positive regulation of cell migration 1 2 We next sought to determine which genes are important for regulating morphogenesis of HUVECs into vessel-like structures from the beginning stages of differentiation to maturation. Principal component analysis from all samples included in the TRAP RNA seq dataset revealed unique clustering at each time point, and that gradual changes in gene expression occur as HUVECs progress through morphogenesis ( 3 ) ( 3 ).

This reporter utilizes a fluorescently labeled Geminin that is expressed through the S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle, but which is ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded as the cell returns to G0/G1 31 ( 6 ) Generation and validation of a morphogenesis gene signature To identify genes that change in 3D culture, independent of time point, https://qlucore.com/ 7 ( 7 Fig. 7 Generation of an in vitro morphogenesis gene signature. a b c Morphogenesis Vascular Development d Morphogenesis Vascular Development To validate the quality of this signature, we compared the performance of this gene set (In Vitro Tube Morphogenesis Vascular Development 32 33 https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/ Vascular Development ( 7 ) ( 7 ) Discussion TRAP seq has been used to evaluate endothelial cell mRNA expression changes in vivo from a variety of organ systems, including the brain which is only 1–2% endothelial cells 13 15 17 4 5 34 17 34 35 In our studies, gene expression changes were evident between 2 and 3D co-culture endothelial cells as early as 24 h, with a strong enrichment of genes associated with vascular motility. This change in migratory gene expression translated to a functional difference in cell migration in 2D culture compared to 3D culture evident 24 h after seeding. The GO analysis demonstrated an enrichment in genes that are involved in positive regulation of cell migration 36 20 37 38 39 18 40 43 One of the major changes occurring from early to late morphogenesis was a vast downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and proliferation. For the Mitotic Cell Cycle 44 45 46 26 27 47 Collectively, our data presented here demonstrates that TRAP seq technology can be utilized in conjunction with complex co-culture models to study gene expression relevant to endothelial cell morphogenesis in both normal and presumably can be extended to investigate pathological contexts, such as those involved in vascular malformations. While the models we have used in these initial studies are far from perfect, lacking flow, and proper investiture with stromal cells, they do mimic many of the hallmarks of early angiogenesis including sprouting, alignment, proliferative quiescence, and tubulogenesis. Moreover, there is no reason why the approaches we have introduced in these studies cannot be used with more complex systems such as organ-on-a chip-approaches, where flow is present. While mechanistic studies have been hampered in these systems by the cellular complexity, TRAP seq provides an attractive and approachable way to rapidly retrieve translating RNAs for expression analysis without the need for cellular purification and associated signaling perturbations. This should be a useful approach for refining molecular hypotheses, including the determination of how perturbations of specific genes critical for normal morphogenesis, such as those in the NOTCH signaling, might contribute to pathological angiogenesis. While our data analyzed the translatome of differentiating endothelial cells, this same technology can be used in other organoid systems such as those investigating epithelial cell differentiation 48 49 50 51 Methods Cell culture Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) from pooled donors were purchased from Lonza and PromoCell and cultured as we have previously described 6 Plasmid construction To construct the pHAGE-Rpl22-3XHA construct, the insert fragment (constructed by gene synthesis (Genewiz) and the pHAGE-IRES-tdTomato destination vector were digested with the NotI-HF (NEBioLabs #R3189S) and XhoI (NEBioLabs #R0146S) restriction enzymes. Following digestion, the Rpl22 fragment was ligated into the expression vector with the Instant Sticky-end Ligase Master Mix (NEBioLabs #M0370S). The final construct was then transformed into NEB Stable bacteria (NEBioLabs #C3040) to allow for plasmid DNA preparation. Viral infection and generation of stable cell lines Lentiviruses were made by co transfection of the pHAGE- RPL22-3X-HA with the packaging plasmids pCMV-VCV-G and pCMV-delta) the Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection kit (Invitrogen L3000-001) into FS293 cells. After 24 h media was replaced with 20% FBS (heat inactivated) MCDB131. High titer virus was harvested at 24 and 48 h after 20% FBS MCDB131 addition. Low passage and sub-confluent HUVECs were infected with lentivirus for 5–6 h with 4ug/mL polybrene. After infection, viral containing media is removed and replaced with ECGM2 and incubated for at least 24 h. Infection efficiency was monitored using the expression of the td-Tomato (pHAGE-RPL22-3XHA) in stably infected cells. For 3D co-culture proliferation assays, cells are infected as described above, with the Fucci cell cycle vector, pRetroX-SG2M-Cyan (Takara bio, #631462). 3D Angiogenesis assays Planar Co-culture- 4 Fibrin bead assay- 5 Live cell migration tracking in 2D and 3D co-culture Endothelial cells expressing an RFP reporter (pSlik-RFP) were seeded simultaneously in either 2D or 3D planar co-culture (as described above) in complete growth medium. To capture migration changes that were suspected to occur based on gene ontology analysis of RNA isolated 24 h post seeding, approximately 22 h after initial seeding, live endothelial cells were imaged (alexa fluor 594) in a chamber at 37’C for a total of 12 h, at a 5-min imaging interval. A total of 5 fields of view were imaged per well/experimental condition using a 20X objective acquiring a total of 145 images per series over the course of 12 h. The first 75 images (corresponding to ~ 6 h from the start of imaging) from each series was analyzed using the mTrackJ plugin in Fiji/ImageJ 52 53 High-resolution live imaging was performed using a fully automated inverted Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) microscope stand equipped with Z-drift compensation, a motorized stage (XYZ), a solid-state light source (Lumencor; Beaverton, OR), Plan Apo air, oil, and silicone immersion objectives, a sCMOS camera (PCO; Kelheim, Germany), a heated stage, and a vibration isolation table, all of which were controlled through the Nikon NIS-Elements software (Version AR 5.41.02 Build 1711; https://www.microscope.healthcare.nikon.com/products/software/nis-elements RNA Isolation, clean-up, and quantitation for TRAP Seq Planar co-cultures are treated with an ice cold 1X PBS containing 100ug/mL cycloheximide wash and flash frozen. RNA lysates are then made with 400uL of polysome buffer for each 60 mm dish of cells. Lysates are homogenized, and subsequently incubated with detergent (1% NP-40) for 20 min at 4 degrees. After incubation with the detergent, tubes are centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 degrees, and RNA containing supernatant is harvested. RNA was immunoprecipitated from planar co-cultures RNA lysate with Pierce anti-HA magnetic beads (Ref #88,837) essentially as previously described 13 Q32853 RNA-seq data processing and differential expression analysis RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were prepared by Azenta Life Sciences and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform, generating paired-end reads.

The voom lmFit eBayes GSEA/Gene signature To generate the in vitro morphogenesis gene signature, we first performed a multivariate analysis of 2D culture vs. each 3D time point with a Q value cutoff of 0.01. This list of differentially expressed genes was used to create the “In Vitro Morphogenesis” gene set that is representative across various stages of morphogenesis. Enrichment of this set was validated in our own data and was compared to another hallmark gene set within MSigDB, “Vascular Development.” GSEA plots were generated using GSEA 4.3.3 a joint project of the Broad Institute and University of California San Diego ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp 32 57 Gene ontology and R plots Gene ontology analyses were completed using both the ShinyGO 0.82 hosted at South Dakota State University ( https://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/ 58 59 60 Statistical analysis All statistical analysis and graphs were made in GraphPad Prism or in R. Experiments were conducted using at least 3 (4 for most) independent pools of primary HUVECs from two different commercial vendors, each pool representing at least three donors of mixed races and sexes. Each ‘n’ represents an independent sample. Statistical significance was performed by two-tailed one- or two-sample unpaired Student’s t-test, or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc.
