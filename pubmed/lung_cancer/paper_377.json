This study investigates the prevalence and prognostic significance of elevated UACR in asthma patients. Methods Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2001–2018), 6,930 adults with asthma were analyzed. Participants were stratified by UACR categories: < 30 mg/g (Group 1), 30–300 mg/g (Group 2), and ≥ 300 mg/g (Group 3). Furthermore, for Group1, we further divided it into tertiles. Kaplan–Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models, restricted cubic splines, and subgroup analyses were employed to assess associations between UACR and mortality. Results Among 6,930 adults with asthma, 809 all-cause and 195 cardiovascular deaths occurred. Elevated UACR was prevalent in 12.6% (Group 2: 10.5%, Group 3: 2.1%). Compared to Group 1, Group 3 had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 2.60, 95% CI:1.44–4.71) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 2.50, 95% CI:1.13–5.55) after full adjustment. Even within the normal range (UACR < 30 mg/g), the highest tertile (Tertile 3) exhibited increased all-cause mortality (HR: 1.69, 95% CI:1.10–2.59). Restricted cubic splines revealed a linear dose–response relationship between UACR and mortality ( P Conclusions Elevated UACR is independently associated with higher all-cause mortality in adults with asthma, even at levels below the traditional threshold for albuminuria. These findings underscore UACR as a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification in asthma management.

Our findings will clarify whether UACR provides unique prognostic information in asthma beyond traditional risk factors, potentially uncovering a novel link between pulmonary and systemic vascular pathology. Methods Study population The NHANES is a comprehensive national survey aimed at evaluating the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S. The survey utilizes a complex multistage cluster design and includes extensive demographics, clinical interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory components [ 19 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes Due to incomplete age information of asthma participants during the 1999–2000 cycle, we included nine cycles between 2001 and 2018 in this analysis. Of 91,351 participants, 7,408 adults (≥ 18 years) with self-reported asthma were included. After excluding participants with missing UACR data ( n n 1 Fig. 1 Flow chart of study population Exposure and primary outcome The UACR was calculated based on measured urinary albumin and urinary creatinine. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, the risk stratification of UACR is divided into three levels from low to high: Group 1 with UACR < 30 mg/g, Group 2 with UACR between 30 and 300 mg/g, and Group 3 with UACR greater than 300 mg/g [ 20 21 The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, defined as death from any cause, while the secondary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. The mortality status was assessed by linkage to death certificate information provided by the National Death Index (NDI) until December 31, 2019. The matching of NHANES data with NDI was achieved by identifying a unique individual sequence number. Assessment of asthma The NHANES study collected information on asthma and related symptoms through a self-administered questionnaire. Participants were considered to have asthma if they answered\"yes\"to the question\"Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that you have asthma?\" [ 22 Assessment of covariates The selection of covariates in this study took into account a range of demographic characteristics and health-related information, including age, sex, race, education. The poverty income ratio (PIR) was categorized into the following three levels: low income (< 1.3), moderate income (1.3–3.5), and high income (> 3.5). The body mass index (BMI) was computed from participants'height and weight measurements. Smoking status was categorized as never (smoking fewer than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime), former (over 100 cigarettes in a lifetime but not currently smoking), and current smoking (more than 100 cigarettes and currently smoking occasionally or daily). Drinking status was dichotomized as yes or no (defined as whether the individual consumed more than 12 drinks per year). Physical activity was classified as vigorous, moderate, or less than moderate. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation using creatinine [ 23 Diagnosis of comorbidities was based on an affirmative response to the question “Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that you had diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), or cancer?” Hypertension was defined by blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg or relevant medications. History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was ascertained based on participants responding affirmatively to either of the following standardized questions: “Have you ever been told by a doctor or health professional that you have COPD”, “Ever told you had chronic bronchitis by a doctor or health professional”, and “Ever told you had emphysema by a doctor or health professional”. This approach to identify COPD patients was implemented successfully in numerous previous studies using the NHANES data [ 24 Statistical analysis All analyses incorporated the appropriate survey weights (WTMEC2YR), with variance estimation accounting for strata (SDMVSTRA) and clustering (SDMVPSU). Continuous variables were reported as the means and standard deviations, while categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages. Baseline characteristics among the different groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Missing values were addressed using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE). Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test was used to evaluate survival differences. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association between UACR levels and the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Separate models were constructed using albuminuria categories and natural log-transformed albuminuria as categorical and continuous predictors, respectively. Given the positively skewed distribution of UACR, log-transformation was applied for continuous analyses to meet model assumptions. Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI, education, and PIR. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for smoking status, drinking status, and physical activity. Model 3 was further adjusted for eGFR, COPD, diabetes, CVD, hypertension, and cancer. Restricted cubic splines were used to show the association between UACR levels and mortality. And the reference value for the calculation of hazard ratios in the restricted cubic spline models was set at UACR = 10 mg/g, corresponding to the median value within the normoalbuminuric range (UACR < 30 mg/g) in our cohort. Moreover, stratified analyses assessed effect modification by age, sex, BMI, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. The interactions between UACR and stratification variables were scrutinized with likelihood ratio tests. The proportional hazards assumption, validated using Schoenfeld residuals, showed no significant violations (all P All analyses were performed in R 4.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Statistical significance was determined by two-sided P Results Baseline characteristics Among 6,930 adults with asthma (mean age 44 ± 17 years; 58% female), 87.4% had normal UACR (Group 1: < 30 mg/g), 10.5% exhibited moderately elevated levels (Group 2: 30–300 mg/g), and 2.1% showed severely elevated levels (Group 3: ≥ 300 mg/g). Participants in higher UACR groups were older, had higher BMI and systolic blood pressure (SBP), and demonstrated significantly greater prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and CVD (all P 1 P P P 1 Table 1 Baseline characteristics by UACR levels in NHANES 2001–2018 (weighted) Characteristic Overall N 1 (< 30 mg/g) N 2 (30-300 mg/g) N 3 (> = 300 mg/g) N P -value Age, years 44 (17) 43 (17) 52 (19) 54 (17) < 0.001 Gender, n (%) < 0.001 Male 2,931 (42%) 2,585 (42%) 270 (31%) 76 (49%) Female 3,999 (58%) 3,471 (58%) 457 (69%) 71 (51%) Race, n (%) 0.003 Mexican American 733 (5.2%) 650 (5.3%) 65 (4.2%) 18 (5.7%) Non-Hispanic White 3,185 (69%) 2,807 (70%) 325 (66%) 53 (58%) Non-Hispanic Black 1,757 (13%) 1,493 (13%) 211 (17%) 53 (23%) Other 1,255 (13%) 1,106 (12%) 126 (14%) 23 (13%) Education, n (%) < 0.001 < 12 1,447 (15%) 1,187 (14%) 210 (23%) 50 (24%) 12 1,424 (22%) 1,226 (22%) 163 (25%) 35 (26%) > 12 3,464 (63%) 3,089 (64%) 316 (52%) 59 (50%) PIR, n (%) < 0.001 < 1.3 2,406 (27%) 2,057 (26%) 288 (33%) 61 (39%) 1.3–3.5 2,232 (34%) 1,904 (34%) 268 (41%) 60 (39%) > 3.5 1,772 (39%) 1,634 (40%) 121 (26%) 17 (23%) BMI, kg/m 2 30 (8) 30 (8) 31 (9) 33 (11) 0.002 SBP, mmHg 121 (16) 120 (15) 130 (20) 134 (27) < 0.001 DBP, mmHg 70 (12) 70 (11) 71 (14) 73 (16) 0.3 Physical activity, n (%) < 0.001 Less than moderate 2,661 (47%) 2,215 (46%) 376 (61%) 70 (68%) Moderate 1,181 (25%) 1,048 (26%) 110 (23%) 23 (25%) Vigorous 1,189 (27%) 1,113 (29%) 66 (16%) 10 (6.5%) Smoking status, n (%) 0.005 Never 3,267 (51%) 2,907 (51%) 302 (43%) 58 (42%) Former 1,646 (25%) 1,374 (25%) 223 (31%) 49 (30%) Current 1,589 (24%) 1,381 (24%) 169 (26%) 39 (27%) Drinking, n (%) 3,495 (77%) 3,071 (77%) 356 (73%) 68 (65%) 0.027 eGFR, ml/min/1.73 m 2 96 (22) 97 (21) 89 (26) 73 (32) < 0.001 COPD, n (%) 1,519 (22%) 1,240 (21%) 232 (33%) 47 (31%) < 0.001 CVD, n (%) 978 (12%) 723 (11%) 186 (23%) 69 (38%) < 0.001 Diabetes, n (%) 1,172 (13%) 805 (10%) 280 (31%) 87 (50%) < 0.001 Hypertension, n (%) 3,389 (51%) 2,754 (49%) 512 (73%) 123 (80%) < 0.001 Cancer, n (%) 700 (11%) 564 (11%) 121 (16%) 15 (7.8%) 0.007 All-cause mortality, n (%) 809 (11.7%) 555 (6.9%) 189 (23%) 65 (35%) < 0.001 Cardiovascular mortality, n (%) 195 (2.8%) 138 (1.6%) 38 (4.6%) 19 (14%) < 0.001 Abbreviations PIR BMI SBP DBP eGFR COPD CVD UACR The baseline characteristics of participants stratified by survival status were presented in Supplementary Table S4.

Interaction testing did not reveal significant effect modification by smoking status ( P There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics after PSM, including age, sex, race, BMI, education, PIR, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, eGFR, and comorbidities, between the asthma and non-asthma groups (Supplementary Table S6). After PSM, compared to Group 1, Group 3 had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 2.64, 95% CI:1.93–3.62) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.08, 95% CI:1.88–5.07) after full adjustment (Supplementary Table S7). This suggests that the relationship between elevated UACR and mortality is robust and not substantially modified by the presence of asthma. While marital status is a recognized socioeconomic factor associated with all-cause mortality in broader populations, sensitivity analyses confirmed it did not confound the UACR-mortality relationship in our cohort (Supplementary Table S8). To address potential confounding by systemic inflammation, we further adjusted our multivariate Cox models for eosinophil count. After this adjustment, the association between elevated UACR (Group 3: > 300 mg/g) and mortality persisted, with HRs of 2.62 (95% CI: 1.40–4.89) for all-cause mortality and 2.62 (95% CI: 1.12–6.11) for cardiovascular mortality (Supplementary Table S9). Discussion This study provides the first evidence that elevated UACR, even within the normal range, is independently associated with increased all-cause mortality in adults with asthma. The relationship remained robust after adjusting for established risk factors, underscoring UACR’s potential as an independent prognostic marker. Strikingly, within the low-normal range (< 30 mg/g), individuals in the highest tertile of UACR associated with a 69% elevated all-cause mortality risk compared to the lowest tertile. This suggests that current thresholds for albuminuria may underestimate risk in asthma, advocating for lower cutoffs to refine risk stratification. Importantly, the prognostic value of UACR persisted across subgroups, suggesting robustness. Numerous studies have established the UACR as a significant predictor of mortality in populations with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or cardiovascular conditions. For instance, among diabetic adults with preserved kidney function, elevated UACR levels within the clinically accepted range independently predict increased all-cause mortality [ 25 21 20 9 17 Our study expands the understanding of UACR in respiratory diseases by demonstrating its prognostic value for mortality in adults with asthma, even within the conventional normal range (< 30 mg/g). Importantly, the prognostic value of UACR remained consistent across age, sex, and comorbidity subgroups, underscoring its reliability in diverse clinical contexts. These results position UACR not only as a marker of renal or vascular dysfunction but also as a potential indicator of systemic inflammatory burden in asthma, warranting integration into routine risk assessment for this high-risk population. Albuminuria, a well-established biomarker of renal endothelial injury [ 26 27 28 30 31 34 35 36 37 38 39 Study strengths and limitations Strengths include a large, nationally representative sample and rigorous adjustment for confounders. However, certain limitations were present. Firstly, while we adjusted for established kidney disease risk factors (eGFR, diabetes, hypertension, CVD), undiagnosed tubulointerstitial disease or glomerular hyperfiltration—common in early metabolic syndrome—may confound UACR elevations. Secondly, UACR was assessed only at baseline, precluding evaluation of temporal changes in UACR and their impact on mortality risk. Finally, causality cannot be inferred due to the observational nature of NHANES. Nevertheless, the large, nationally representative sample and long follow-up strengthen validity. Prospective cohort studies focusing on temporal changes in UACR and their correlation with asthma severity and outcomes could provide more insights into causality. Additionally, mechanistic studies exploring the underlying biological pathways linking albuminuria to increased mortality in asthma, such as endothelial dysfunction or systemic inflammation would be invaluable. Conclusions Elevated UACR is prevalent in adults with asthma and is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. These findings underscore the prognostic value of UACR in asthma, even at levels traditionally classified as normal. Notably, gradients in risk persisted within the\"normal\"UACR range, suggesting that subclinical albuminuria may reflect early vascular or systemic injury. These results advocate for integrating UACR into routine asthma care to enhance risk stratification and guide preventive strategies. Future studies should explore whether UACR-lowering therapies improve outcomes in this population. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
