Regardless of etiology, its pathogenesis is driven by persistent liver inflammation, which can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and an increased risk of cancer development. Myeloid cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, play diverse and critical roles in hepatic immunity and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis but are also involved in liver injury, disease progression, and resolution. With the emergence of high-resolution omics technologies and in vivo fate-mapping models, our understanding of myeloid cell ontogeny and functional heterogeneity has been significantly refined. In this review, we discuss current insights into the myeloid cell landscape in nonviral chronic liver inflammatory conditions and summarize the roles of myeloid cell subsets in disease pathogenesis.

MASLD, which is globally recognized as the fastest growing cause of CLD, particularly in the Western world (with a prevalence of 25–30%) [ 5 6 7 3 8 9 Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies and histologic interface hepatitis, with a variable clinical presentation (asymptomatic, acute liver failure, or CLD) [ 10 11 12 13 Chronic liver injury, regardless of etiology, leads to persistent activation of hepatic immune responses and subsequent inflammation. This in turn leads to aberrant activation of extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing cells such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) [ 14 15 16 The liver: a central immunological organ The liver is the largest solid organ in the body. It is conventionally considered a nonimmunological organ that is primarily responsible for lipid metabolism, nutrient storage, and detoxification. To fulfill its physiological functions, the liver is primarily composed of hepatocytes, which are parenchymal cells that account for ~60–70% of the total cell count and 80% of the liver mass [ 17 18 17 18 1A 19 Fig. 1 The liver is an immunological organ. A B The unique structure of liver sinusoids, characterized by fenestrated endothelial cells lacking a basement membrane, facilitates low-pressure blood flow, enabling direct interactions between immune cells and hepatocytes, as well as the exchange of substances. Variations in the microenvironment, including Wnt signaling, oxygen levels, and nutrient gradients, give rise to functional liver zonation [ 20 21 17 21 22 23 25 26 27 28 30 The liver plays a critical role in immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis because of its strategic location at the confluence of the dual blood supply (Fig. 1A 31 32 32 33 33 34 Under homeostatic conditions, the liver is predominantly populated by innate immune cells, including macrophages, DCs, and natural killer (NK) cells [ 32 34 1B 35 36 Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli E. coli 28 37 48 The ability of the liver to recognize and neutralize danger signals relies on the broad expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors [ 49 50 Myeloid cells in chronic liver inflammation Myeloid cells constitute a significant proportion of leukocytes in the circulation and peripheral tissues, including the skin, lungs, gut, and liver [ 51 51 56 57 58 59 60 61 67 68 72 Neutrophils Origin and functions of neutrophils Neutrophils, the predominant type of circulating leukocyte, are endowed with antipathogenic and inflammatory effector functions and are therefore critical for maintaining host immunity and tissue homeostasis [ 73 74 75 Neutrophils develop through granulopoiesis, an intricately regulated process by which immune cells in the bone marrow undergo progressive modifications to their transcriptomic, proteomic, structural, and consequently functional properties before being released into the circulation [ 52 52 52 76 74 In the event of emergency granulopoiesis triggered by physiological stress, de novo neutrophil generation occurs [ 77 52 74 74 74 78 79 80 81 82 83 Neutrophils are among the first innate immune cells to mobilize to sites of tissue injury, orchestrating the host immune response during inflammation while also coordinating critical antipathogen responses. They perform several antipathogen effector functions that, even in a state of health, vary depending on neutrophil density (determined by nuclear morphology and granule content), maturation stage, or activation state [ 74 59 9 84 Neutrophils capture and kill pathogens through several mechanisms. They interact directly with pathogens or via receptors such as Fc receptors (FccRIIIB/CD16 and FccRIIA/CD32), integrins (CD11b/CD18), and complement receptors (CR1/CD35 and CR3) to facilitate phagocytosis [ 8 9 9 52 59 85 86 Pathogen interactions and inflammatory signals can also induce neutrophil degranulation, leading to the release of proteases, MPO, and defensins that contribute to pathogen destruction. In addition, neutrophils produce various chemokines [C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL2, CXCL8 and CXCL12] and cytokines, including proinflammatory (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), anti-inflammatory [IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)], and immunoregulatory (IL-22, IL-23) mediators [ 9 52 59 Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, or NETosis, is another key function of these cells. NETs consist of extruded decondensed DNA, citrullinated histones, and a mixture of proteins of nuclear, cytosolic, and granular origin, including neutrophil elastase (NE) and MPO [ 9 52 59 52 87 In homeostasis, the effector functions of neutrophils are well-regulated and harmoniously coordinated, leading to the resolution of inflammation, preservation of tissue integrity through injury healing, and efficient eradication of invading pathogens. However, in states of aberrant activation or sustained inflammation, neutrophil dysfunction can prevail, resulting in tissue damage and disease progression, depending on the underlying pathology. Neutrophils in chronic liver inflammation MASLD In steatotic liver disease, lipid accumulation within hepatocytes induces metabolic stress. This triggers the activation of resident immune cells and the subsequent recruitment of circulating immune cells in response to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Hepatic neutrophil infiltration is a hallmark of MASH development [ 88 89 90 91 92 91 93 Neutrophil-derived factors such as NE and human neutrophil peptide-1 (HNP-1) can activate KCs and recruited macrophages while also inducing the proliferation of HSCs [ 94 95 96 97 90 98 99 90 100 100 Aberrant neutrophil activation further leads to NETosis, with elevated serum NET levels observed in MASH patients [ 8 92 101 101 102 ALD In ALD, neutrophil recruitment depends on multiple variables, including neutrophil priming, circulating chemokines, and the activation of LSECs [ 103 104 105 106 In AH, gastrointestinal dysbiosis and increased gut permeability lead to a greater bacterial load in the enterohepatic circulation. Recognition of PAMPs activates neutrophils and their arsenal of antimicrobial functions. Evidence suggests that neutrophils in AH are hyperresponsive, producing increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 107 108 109 109 103 + + 109 Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of hepatic neutrophils in AH has revealed an expanded IL-8 + 110 110 + Overall, in the context of AH, neutrophils exhibit a proinflammatory, typically low-density phenotype that is aberrantly activated in response to dysbiosis. This activation drives the recruitment and differentiation of various innate immune cell subtypes. When unregulated, this process perpetuates inflammation, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. AIH, PBC, and PSC Dysregulation of immune responses to self-antigens is a hallmark of autoimmune disorders [ 52 111 111 In AIH, the presence of an expanded population of circulating LDNs has been described [ 112 112 115 + 112 115 In biliary injury, particularly in PBC, proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, are released [ 116 116 117 117 118 117 119 In PSC, a mixed biliary tract inflammatory cell infiltrate, including lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, NK cells, and macrophages, has been described [ 116 120 116 121 + 118 122 123 + −/− 124 Overall, neutrophils have not been widely explored in patients with liver autoimmune conditions, which may be challenging because of the significant histological overlap among AIH, PBC, and PSC. Further work is needed to comprehensively evaluate phenotypic variations in circulating and liver-infiltrating neutrophils to better understand their role in disease pathogenesis. Fibrosis Although they are driven primarily by HSC activation and transdifferentiation, neutrophils play an active role in sustaining inflammation and thereby promoting liver fibrogenesis (Fig. 2A 125 127 128 125 Fig. 2 Neutrophils in fibrosis and cirrhosis. A B Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils also play a critical role in the resolution phase of injury. To successfully promote fibrolysis and degradation of the ECM, the underlying drivers of injury and inflammation must be resolved for HSCs to return to a quiescent phenotype [ 125 hi lo lo hi 125 129 130 131 103 Neutrophils also appear to directly promote fibrosis regression (Fig. 2A 4 132 133 134 135 phox 130 136 130 136 Cirrhosis: Driving the development of multiorgan failure and death in patients with acutely decompensated cirrhosis (AD) and acute-to-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is increased susceptibility to bacterial infections [ 137 138 139 142 2B 143 144 145 Neutrophil chemotaxis is reduced in cirrhosis patients because of a combination of intrinsic cellular defects and the impaired or inhibited chemoattractant ability of cirrhotic serum [ 146 147 59 148 149 150 Impaired phagocytosis capacity has been widely described in patients with cirrhosis. Phagocytic capacity in the context of E. coli 151 152 153 154 Candida albicans 155 Impaired neutrophil ROS production and degranulation have been described in cirrhosis [ 151 156 59 151 157 158 157 159 151 156 158 E. coli E. coli 151 153 158 59 The intracellular neutrophil enzyme content and its release from neutrophil granules upon stimulation and activation have been shown to be reduced in patients with cirrhosis. The number of cirrhotic neutrophils that produce MPO, as well as the total MPO produced, has been reported to be reduced [ 160 154 161 159 NET formation has been implicated in sustained liver injury and inflammation. Dysfunctional NETosis and impaired clearance of apoptotic neutrophils (efferocytosis) following binge drinking in mouse models of AH have been shown to exacerbate liver injury associated with sepsis [ 109 159 162 163 164 165 166 HCC HCC is the most common primary liver cancer and typically develops in the context of underlying CLDs of various etiologies. Although liver carcinogenesis is a multifactorial process, with predisposing factors varying depending on the cancer subtype [ 15 167 168 169 83 The HCC microenvironment is particularly immunosuppressive, with immune cell infiltrates being primarily composed of heterogeneous tumor-associated neutrophil (TAN) types. Depending on environmental signals, TANs can be polarized into antitumor (N1) or protumor (N2) phenotypes [ 83 hi hi hi + - 170 171 170 171 Notably, polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) constitute an immature neutrophil population (CD33 + −/lo 172 172 173 174 175 83 Neutrophil recruitment into the tumor and polarization to a pro-tumorigenic type are crucial for tumor development. HCC cells and stromal cells produce chemokines to drive neutrophil recruitment. Various CXC chemokine receptors are upregulated in HCC tumor cells [ 83 176 177 178 179 83 83 Neutrophils suppress antitumoral immune responses [e.g., via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression], inhibit CD4 + + 180 181 + + 182 183 184 185 185 The abundance of tumoral and circulating neutrophils has been reported to independently predict adverse outcomes in patients with HCC [ 186 187 188 175 189 83 179 3 Fig. 3 Neutrophils in hepatocellular carcinoma.

This figure was created with BioRender (biorender.com) Eosinophils Origin and functions of eosinophils Eosinophil development, termed eosinophilopoiesis, involves the differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells into CMPs, followed by GMPs, before committing to the eosinophil lineage through eosinophil lineage-committed progenitors, which subsequently mature into eosinophils [ 60 190 191 192 190 193 199 200 201 Eosinophils are recruited via eotaxins such as CCL11 and CCL24, which are recognized by C–C motif chemokine receptor 3. They secrete lipid mediators and several granule proteins, including major basic protein 1 and 2 (MBP-1 and MBP-2), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eosinophil peroxidase [ 60 202 60 202 203 204 205 Eosinophils in chronic liver inflammation AIH, PBC, and PSC Eosinophils are present in the bone marrow, blood, and peripheral organs but are infrequently detected in the liver during homeostasis [ 202 206 207 206 208 208 209 210 212 213 Fibrosis Eosinophils have been implicated in combating parasitic infections such as Schistosoma mansoni 214 215 216 60 217 Schistosoma mansoni 218 60 219 219 221 222 HCC The role of eosinophils in cancer development is controversial, as they have been demonstrated to play both pro- and antioncogenic roles across different cancer types [ 223 224 225 226 227 + + 228 229 Monocytes and macrophages Origin and functions of monocytes/macrophages Monocytes are phagocytes derived from hematopoietic stem cells that are typically found in peripheral blood and are able to differentiate into tissue macrophages or DCs during pathological inflammatory conditions [ 230 + lo lo hi + + 231 + − 53 232 233 Under homeostatic conditions, the liver macrophage compartment (Fig. 4 29 53 61 232 234 235 236 Fig. 4 Macrophages in chronic liver inflammation Homeostasis Cholestasis: Alcohol: MASLD/MASH: Fibrosis + + + Cancer: + + - + + + + EM KCs are located within the hepatic sinusoids, predominantly in the periportal regions. Their membrane protrusions extend toward the peri-sinusoidal space, enabling close contact with HSCs and hepatocytes. Interplay with these cells, as well as interactions with gut commensals and TLR4/MyD88-mediated LSEC microbial sensing, have been proven crucial for the maintenance of this spatial distribution, which, in turn, is of paramount importance for the preservation of tissue homeostasis [ 22 28 30 The main functions of KCs in homeostasis include the phagocytosis of pathogens, the maintenance of an immune-tolerant microenvironment [ 28 37 48 237 239 50 240 241 49 30 242 243 A multitude of KC markers have been described, reflecting their diverse physiological duties. Both mouse and human KCs express T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 4 (TIMD4) and V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing 4 (VSIG4), which play significant roles in liver-mediated iron homeostasis [ 244 245 246 248 29 29 249 250 251 In addition to KCs, three other macrophage subsets have been described in healthy livers. Liver capsule macrophages (LCMs) are monocyte-derived cells (expressing CX3CR1 and CD207 in mice) lacking KC markers such as VSIG4 [ 29 252 29 4 Gpnmb Spp1 Trem Cd9 253 + 29 lo − hi + 254 255 29 256 Monocytes/macrophages in chronic liver inflammation MASLD In MASLD/MASH, the total number of hepatic macrophages increases due to the recruitment of circulating monocytes, which differentiate into macrophages in the liver (Fig. 4 50 66 257 258 259 260 + 261 262 hi 263 KC numbers are consistently decreased in mouse MASLD/MASH models, with liver-infiltrating monocytes differentiating into mo-KCs and occupying their place [ 251 253 264 264 265 266 267 268 269 253 270 In addition, impairment of the proliferative capacity of KCs has been shown to affect KC numbers. A diminished ability to self-renew, accompanied by the emergence of mo-KCs, has been reported in a model of L. monocytogenes 39 251 271 The existence of LAMs and their human analogs is generally considered ubiquitous in MASLD, with their niche-specific localization linked to disease progression.

Compared with WT animals, CRIg-deficient mice developed more severe liver injury after chronic plus binge ethanol feeding, exhibiting significantly greater steatosis and liver inflammation. Additionally, these mice showed a diminished ability to clear gut-translocated E. faecalis 283 284 PSC and PBC Compared with those in control tissues, increased numbers of periportal/peribiliary and fibrotic region-adjacent CD68 + 4 285 286 + Tgfb Acta2 285 + + + + − + + Mdr2 −/− + Mdr2 -/- + 286 Biliary epithelial dysregulation has been shown to drive the development of scar tissue in a mouse model of congenital hepatic fibrosis, primarily in a macrophage-dependent manner.

Circulating monocytes from patients with compensated and not acutely decompensated (NAD) cirrhosis were partitioned into seven clusters on the basis of scRNA-seq data. Interestingly, a shift toward a phagocytic phenotype in compensated cirrhosis and the emergence of M-MDSCs in NAD were observed [ 318 319 HCC and iCCA The predominant hypothesis is that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MDSCs act in a protumorigenic manner in HCC [ 167 320 + + − + + T-cell + + 321 PD-L1 expression is generally associated with HCC immune suppression [ 322 + 323 + + + + + + 324 + + 325 + + + 326 + + 327 In humans, CCR2 + 4 4 lo hi + Il-1β S100a9 Vegfa, Mmp9 lo lo hi lo/int lo hi + 328 Comparative transcriptomic analysis of human HCC, normal liver tissue, and fetal liver revealed the presence of distinct macrophage populations in tumor tissue, initially subdivided by high (TAM1s) or low (TAM2/3 s) expression of CD163.

DC-specific deletion of LKB1 led to increased insulin resistance; increased proportions of hepatic regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells; increased expression of Cd36 and fibrotic markers; worsened steatosis; and elevated triglyceride and cholesterol levels. This effect was mitigated by the blockade of IL-17A, while ex vivo, cDC2s from LKB1 knockout mice exhibited increased production of the Th17-promoting cytokines Il6 Il1β 367 hi + hi + 369 DCs have also been implicated in MASH regression.

Two key examples that highlight efforts to bridge this knowledge gap involve recent observations of macrophages and neutrophils. Under both steady-state and inflammatory conditions, hepatic macrophages are highly heterogeneous, comprising various niche- and context-instructed subsets (resident and recruited) with distinct transcriptional profiles and activation states. Future studies employing targeted approaches to modulate specific subsets and/or genetically manipulate expressed factors are needed to elucidate their precise functions and contributions to CLD pathophysiology and identify targets for the development of macrophage-tailored therapies. Regarding neutrophils—cells once considered largely transcriptionally inactive—advances in sequencing technologies adapted to their volatile nature have revealed a new level of complexity, including a dynamic transcriptional program that remains to be fully explored in different CLD settings. The acquisition of this wealth of new information can be attributed, in part, to advancements in novel multiomics approaches. The integration of high-resolution microscopy with proteomic and single-cell or single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses continues to shed light on the functional and phenotypic variations of myeloid subpopulations and to facilitate the discovery of unrecognized subsets through the identification of novel markers. Hence, researchers are now equipped to study cell subsets that have previously remained elusive and to implement a more granular approach in analyzing the involvement of specific pathways or molecules in various forms of CLD. These new approaches may also help overcome challenges associated with studying rare cell populations by enabling more precise molecular and functional distinctions from phenotypically similar cells. The discovery of novel cell subset markers will be particularly crucial for advancing DC research. The broad use of CD11c-targeted modifications in vivo (e.g., CD11c-cre, CD11c-DTR) does not allow for a more detailed study of the intricacies of pDC or cDC subset biology and their disease relevance. Moreover, DC subset-specific transgenic models (e.g., XCR1-cre) have yet to be employed in the context of CLD. Although DC-targeted therapeutic approaches are already being explored, particularly in oncology with DC vaccines and TME modulation, targeting T-cell/DC or LSEC/DC interactions may also represent promising avenues for antifibrotic therapies. Finally, spatially resolved omics will further contextualize the role of cell type localization in CLD progression and regression. The spatial distribution of immune cells during homeostasis is vital for supporting their function and often reflects it. As discussed above, the niche-specific accumulation of immune subsets has been linked to various types and stages of CLD, with transcriptomic data providing an additional layer of insight into their function and potential for therapeutic targeting. In the coming years, the broader application of spatial omics to human liver tissue holds great promise for advancing our understanding of liver myeloid cell biology and identifying novel therapeutic strategies.
