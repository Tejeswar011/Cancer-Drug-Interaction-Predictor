The Planetary Health Diet Index for the United States (PHDI-US), a sustainable dietary pattern emphasizing a plant-based diet, has great potential for chronic disease prevention and control, but its relationship with HUA is unclear. Methods This study was based on nationally representative NHANES data. Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models were used to assess the association between raw PHDI-US and HUA. The key dietary component Dairy was identified by machine learning, the optimized PHDI-Dairy index was constructed, and the association between dairy intake and HUA risk was verified in an independent self-built cohort. Results Primitive PHDI-US was significantly negatively correlated with the risk of HUA, but its protective effect was weaker than traditional dietary indices such as AHEI, AEI, and MEDI. Machine learning results show that Dairy is the most critical component in PHDI-US composition. The PHDI-Dairy index, constructed after optimizing the weight of dairy products, was more negatively correlated with the risk of HUA, and the protection efficiency was better than that of other dietary indices. External validation further confirmed that increased dairy intake was associated with a low risk of HUA. Conclusion PHDI-US was negatively correlated with the risk of HUA. After optimizing the weighting of dairy products, PHDI-Dairy demonstrated a significantly enhanced protective effect, outperforming both the original PHDI and other dietary indices. This result highlights its potential as a nutritional intervention tool for chronic diseases, contributing to both public health and environmental sustainability.

This threshold is based on the saturated concentration of uric acid in physiological fluids. When it exceeds, the risk of urate crystal precipitation increases significantly, which can easily cause gout ( 1 2 3–5 6 7 In recent decades, the global burden of diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has increased dramatically, and the current food production and consumption system also poses a major threat to the health of the planet. Based on this, the EAT-Leaf Blade Committee has proposed a dietary model that combines health and sustainability goals. In order to evaluate people’s compliance with this dietary pattern, it is necessary to establish corresponding indicators. The Planetary Health Diet Index for the United States (PHDI-US) came into being ( 8 9 10 11 12 6 2 Methods 2.1 Study population The data of this study are from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) public database. The NHANES aims to comprehensively assess the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population with a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling design. The study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with a sample size of 22,087 participants. Given that NHANES is a large, publicly available dataset, no explicit sample size estimation was required. The study selected the NHANES cycle data from 2005 to 2018 as the basis for analysis. The data during this period covered the latest diet, biochemical tests, and health status information. In terms of research object screening, adult participants aged ≥ 20 years were first included to ensure that the study population had relatively mature and stable characteristics in physiology and eating habits. Other exclusion criteria were: (1) missing data on gender, education, race, PIR, diabetes, and smoking; (2) Missing diet and HUA data. Finally, 22,087 participants were included in this study. The NHANES database has been approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the National Center for Health Statistics of the United States, and all participants have signed informed consent to ensure the compliance and ethical rationality of research data acquisition. The research strictly follows the ethical principles established by the ‘Helsinki Declaration ‘from beginning to end. The presentation and publication of the research results are only displayed in the form of a group data summary, and do not involve the specific information of any individual participant. Relevant information can be obtained from the NCHS website ( Figure 1 1 Figure 1 Flow chart of participant selection from the NHANES 2005–2018 cycles. Flowchart showing the selection process of participants from NHANES data (2005-2018) starting with 55,902 participants. Exclusions are made in two steps: first, 13,621 were removed for reasons such as age under twenty, and missing data on gender, education, race, PIR, diabetes, and smoking; resulting in 42,281 participants. Second, a further 14,525 were excluded due to missing dietary and HUA data. The final count is 22,087 participants included. 2.2 Assessment of Planetary Health Diet Index Professionally trained investigators used the USDA Automated Multiple Pass Method to collect 24-h dietary review data ( 13 14 15 16 17 2 18 8 2.3 Diagnosis of hyperuricemia Uric acid concentration was determined by the Beckman Coulter LX20 (Brea, CA) colorimetry ( 19 20 2.4 Self-built cohort This study included a cohort of 2,819 individuals from southern China with complete data on hyperuricemia (HUA) and dairy intake. This cohort was a retrospective study conducted in Guangxi, where participants were selected based on the following criteria: adults aged over 20 years, with documented uric acid laboratory tests, physical examinations, and no clear history of renal disease, nephritis, or related endocrine disorders. The diagnostic criteria for HUA were consistent with those described above, and dairy intake was assessed based on the component-specific scoring standards of the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) developed by the EAT–Lancet Commission. This was a retrospective study that did not involve any personally identifiable information or biological specimens. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Liuzhou People’s Hospital (Approval No. KY2025-009-01). Research involving human participants was reviewed and approved by the same committee. All participants provided written informed consent prior to inclusion in the study. 2.5 Covariate The covariates were determined by a comprehensive review of literature and clinical expertise. These variables include socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, race, education level, household poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), drinking and smoking history. In addition, hypertension and diabetes outcomes were also considered. Demographic characteristics were collected through standardized questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. With 1.3 times the poverty line as the boundary, PIR < 1.3 is defined as the poverty level, and PIR ≥ 1.3 is the non-poverty level. Hypertension was defined as a patient’s self-reported history of hypertension, use of antihypertensive drugs, systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg. Diabetes was defined as a history of diabetes, HbA1c level ≥ 6.5% or fasting blood glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL. The classification of the remaining covariates can be seen in Table 1 Table 1 Baseline characteristics of participants.

The dataset was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%) to evaluate model performance. The model parameters were tuned to reduce overfitting risk: the number of trees was set to 100, the maximum tree depth was restricted to 3, the minimum samples required for splitting an internal node was 2, and the minimum samples required at a leaf node was 1. The loss function was set to squared error. The maximum number of features considered at each split was optimized, and the threshold for splitting was set at 0.0001. Model performance and generalizability were assessed using the testing set and out-of-bag (OOB) error estimates. The comparable performance between training and testing sets indicated that overfitting was not a major concern. Feature importance was subsequently derived from the mean decrease in impurity across all trees. 2.7 Statistical method In order to ensure the national representativeness of the survey data, this study adopted the weight system recommended by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Continuous variables were described by mean ± standard deviation (normal distribution) or median (non-normal distribution), and t test was used to compare the differences between groups. The categorical variables were described by composition ratio, and the chi-square test was used for comparison between groups. Using the quartile grouping method, the subjects were divided into four groups according to the PHDI level, and the lowest group (Quartile 1) was used as a reference to construct three logistic regression models that gradually adjusted confounding factors. Model 1 did not adjust for confounding factors, Model 2 adjusted for gender and age, and Model 3 adjusted for age, gender, race, PIR, education, BMI, smoking, and hypertension. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to show the association strength between different dietary quality index groups and HUA, and the trend test (P for trend) was performed to determine whether the association changed regularly with the grouping. At the same time, the restricted cubic splines (RCS) method was used to fit the dose–response relationship model, and the RCS Prediction Plot was drawn to visually present the nonlinear correlation between the continuous variables of dietary quality index and HUA risk. In order to identify the dietary factors most related to the reduction of HUA risk, machine learning methods such as random forest and feature importance analysis were used to evaluate 16 food components of PHDI-US. Based on the key features of model screening, the original PHDI-US is recalibrated. Then, through logistic regression and linear regression, the recalibrated PHDI-US, original PHDI-US, and the other three dietary indices (AHEI, HEI, and MEDI) were compared to analyze the difference in the efficacy of each index in reducing the risk of HUA and its linear correlation with HUA. In order to verify the dose–response relationship between dairy intake and hyperuricemia, this study used an independent cohort of the southern Chinese population for analysis, and used restricted cubic spline (RCS), logistic regression, and quantile regression to evaluate. It is worth noting that although the study confirmed that there was a significant correlation between PHDI-US and HUA, the results only showed correlation, and no causal relationship was established. A cohort of the southern Chinese population was used to verify the dose–response relationship between dairy intake and hyperuricemia. The statistical methods used were restricted cubic spline, logistic regression, and quantile regression. All statistical analyses were performed using the R language. All hypothesis tests were set to a bilateral significance level of 0.05; that is, when the p 3 Results 3.1 Baseline characteristics of the study population To explore the differences in characteristics between non-HUA and HUA populations and their potential association with PHDI-US, this study analyzed baseline characteristics by grouping patients with or without HUA.

Error bars indicate variability. 3.4 Sensitivity analysis Compared with PHDI-US, PHDI-Dairy optimizes the prediction performance to some extent. Specifically, the AUC of PHDI-US was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.50–0.52), which was close to the random level. The sensitivity of PHDI was high but the confidence interval was wide (0.72, 95% CI: 0.28–0.83). The specificity of PHDI-US was low (0.30, 95% CI: 0.21–0.76). The positive predictive value (PPV) was weak (0.18, 95% CI: 0.17–0.19), and the negative predictive value (NPV) was good (0.84, 95% CI: 0.83–0.86). The AUC of the modified PHDI-Dairy was slightly increased to 0.54 (95% CI: 0.53–0.55). The sensitivity decreased to 0.56 (95% CI: 0.53–0.58) but the confidence interval was significantly narrowed. The specificity was improved to 0.51 (95% CI: 0.50–0.52), and a good negative exclusion ability was maintained (NPV was 0.85, 95% CI: 0.84–0.86).

The graph reports an overall p-value of 0.003 and a nonlinear p-value of 0.988. 3.6 Mediation analysis In this study, we conducted a mediation analysis to explore the mechanism by which the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI-Dairy) influences hyperuricemia (HUA). The results showed that the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between PHDI-Dairy and HUA. Specifically, the indirect effect (IE) of PHDI-Dairy on HUA was −0.0007, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (−0.0009, −0.0005), indicating that PHDI-Dairy exerts its effect on lowering HUA risk through the improvement of UACR. Additionally, the proportion of mediation by UACR was 11.29%, meaning that 11.29% of the effect of PHDI-Dairy on HUA is mediated through the improvement of UACR. More details can be seen in Figure 7 Figure 7 Mediation analysis of the association between PHDI-Dairy and hyperuricemia (HUA) with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) as a mediator. Indirect effect (IE), direct effect (DE), and proportion mediated were estimated using mediation models with 95% confidence intervals.

The indirect effect (IE) is negative zero point zero zero zero seven with a ninety-five percent confidence interval of negative zero point zero zero zero nine to negative zero point zero zero zero five. The direct effect (DE) is negative zero point zero zero five five with a ninety-five percent confidence interval of negative zero point zero zero seven to negative zero point zero zero four three. The proportion of mediation is eleven point two nine percent. 4 Discussion Based on the nationally representative NHANES data, this study systematically explored the relationship between PHDI-US and the risk of hyperuricemia for the first time. Our analysis showed that a higher PHDI-US score (indicating a healthier plant-based diet pattern) was associated with a significantly reduced risk of HUA. This negative correlation is still robust after a multivariate adjustment model. Although PHDI-US showed a protective effect, its correlation strength was significantly weaker than AHEI and AEI. In order to further optimize the prediction performance, this study applied machine learning methods to improve the PHDI-Dairy index. The association between this index and HUA risk reduction was significantly stronger than that of the original PHDI-US, AHEI, AEI, and MEDI. Sensitivity analysis showed the enhancement effect of PHDI-Dairy, especially its improvement in discrimination and negative predictive value. External validation further confirmed the protective effect of Dairy on hyperuricemia. This finding reveals the importance of weight improvement of the dietary index, and also provides a new idea for dietary intervention of metabolic diseases. Existing evidence indicates that the PHDI-US is not only associated with a lower risk of HUA but also exhibits protective effects against various chronic diseases. In cardiovascular disease, adherence to PHDI-US is linked to a reduced risk ( 10 21 22 23 11 24 25 26 From the perspective of metabolic pathways, the plant-based diet advocated by PHDI-US can directly reduce the dietary purine load by replacing the red meat diet ( 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 Recent evidence indicates that the controversy surrounding beans and purines in the context of plant-based diets and uric acid metabolism may be overstated. While beans and soy products are relatively rich in purines, several large-scale prospective cohort studies and meta-analyses have consistently shown that plant-derived purines exert a weaker impact on serum uric acid levels and gout risk compared with animal-derived purines such as those from meat and seafood ( 36 37 38 39 40 Notably, this study used machine learning to optimize the PHDI-US into PHDI-Dairy. The effectiveness of this improved strategy was shown in the logistic regression model, and external validation further confirmed the significant protective role of dairy against HUA, underscoring the scientific value of targeted dietary index refinement. The original PHDI-US showed weaker protective effects than other indices, likely due to its stronger emphasis on “environmental sustainability.” For example, limiting red meat intake to no more than 2.4% of total calories, but the weight distribution of key nutritional components of uric acid metabolism (such as dairy products) is insufficient. Dairy is a major dietary source of calcium and contains proteins (mainly casein and whey), fat, and lactose. The enhanced performance of PHDI-Dairy may be attributed to several mechanisms: facilitating calcium-dependent urinary uric acid excretion ( 41 42 43 44 45 From the perspective of clinical significance, the PHDI-Dairy proposed in this study provides a new intervention direction for the prevention and treatment of HUA. In the face of patients with hyperuricemia, doctors may develop personalized dietary plans based on the dietary patterns recommended by PHDI-US, and assist in disease treatment by adjusting the dietary structure. From the perspective of public health, PHDI-US is of great value in environmental protection. PHDI-US advocates increasing plant food intake and reducing the consumption of animal products (especially red meat), which can reduce agricultural-related environmental damage from the source. Taking animal husbandry as an example, animal-free US agricultural modeling systems can reduce US agricultural greenhouse gases (28%) ( 46 47 This study has several limitations. The cross-sectional design is difficult to establish the causal timing relationship between dietary patterns and HUA, which needs to be further verified by follow-up cohort studies. PHDI-Dairy’s dairy product weight optimization is based on the dietary characteristics of the American population. Whether it is universal in the Asian population dominated by soybean consumption still needs to be verified by cross-regional research. In addition, the research data relies on 24-h recall, which does not reflect long-term dietary patterns and is susceptible to recall bias. A key limitation of our study is the reliance on two 24-h dietary recalls to estimate usual intake. Although 24-h recalls are widely used in nutritional epidemiology, they may not fully capture long-term dietary habits and are subject to day-to-day variability. Moreover, recall bias is inevitable, as participants may underreport or misreport certain food groups, such as dairy products or plant-based items, which could influence the accuracy of PHDI and dairy intake assessments. These measurement errors may attenuate the observed associations and should be acknowledged as a potential source of uncertainty when interpreting the findings. Another limitation concerns the generalizability of the optimized PHDI-Dairy. The index was originally derived from U.S. dietary data and subsequently applied to a Chinese cohort, where dietary patterns differ substantially, particularly in the relative contribution of dairy versus soy products. Such cultural differences in staple food choices and protein sources may influence both the validity and applicability of the optimized index across populations. Therefore, while our findings support the utility of PHDI-Dairy in the Chinese context, further validation and potential adaptations are warranted before applying the index in other cultural settings. Future work should consider region-specific dietary structures to ensure broader applicability and accuracy. It should be noted that although the associations between PHDI-US, PHDI-Dairy and health outcomes were statistically significant, their predictive performance in terms of discrimination was relatively weak, as reflected by AUC values close to 0.5. It is important to note that the primary goal of this study was not prediction, but rather to optimize the index. The higher AUC after adjustment compared to before adjustment demonstrates that the optimization was successful. Future research should therefore aim to integrate PHDI-US with other biomarkers or lifestyle indicators to improve predictive utility and to explore its application in diverse clinical and public health contexts. Another limitation relates to the external “southern China” cohort used for validation. Although this cohort provides valuable data for testing the applicability of the index in a different setting, its recruitment procedures and representativeness may limit generalizability. Participants were drawn from a specific regional population, which may not fully reflect the broader demographic and dietary diversity of southern China. In addition, potential selection bias and unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out, which should be taken into account when interpreting the external validation results. This study highlights the health benefits of optimizing dairy intake, such as improving bone health and providing essential nutrients like calcium and protein. However, the environmental impact of dairy production, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and water usage, remains a key concern. Balancing these benefits with sustainability is crucial. One approach is to promote lower-fat or fermented dairy products, which can reduce health risks while still delivering nutritional value. Additionally, incorporating plant-based alternatives, like almond or oat milk, can help reduce environmental impact while providing similar nutritional benefits. Ultimately, optimizing dairy intake in a way that promotes both health and sustainability is central to achieving the goals of the Planetary Health Diet Index. The mediation analysis in this study revealed that the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI-Dairy) influences hyperuricemia (HUA) partly through the improvement of kidney function, as indicated by the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Specifically, PHDI-Dairy reduces the risk of HUA by improving UACR levels, accounting for 11.29% of the total effect. This finding underscores the potential role of kidney function in the protective effect of PHDI-Dairy on HUA. Although we did not initially hypothesize that this effect would primarily be mediated through kidney function, this finding offers new insights, suggesting that protecting kidney function may be an important pathway in reducing HUA risk while optimizing diet. Future studies could further explore other potential mediating mechanisms and assess their applicability across different populations. Based on the above findings, future studies can further carry out prospective intervention trials of PHDI-Dairy to clarify the dose-effect relationship between dairy intake and uric acid metabolism. It is also possible to develop improved versions of regionalized PHDI (such as the Asian version to increase the weight of soy products) to promote the precise and personalized development of dietary intervention programs. These explorations will not only deepen the scientific understanding of the relationship between diet and uric acid metabolism, but also provide a more solid evidence base for the collaborative intervention strategy of `healthy diet-disease prevention-environmental protection`. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, this study suggests that while PHDI-US shows a weaker protective effect against hyperuricemia (HUA) compared with other dietary indices in high-adherence populations, the optimized PHDI-Dairy demonstrates superior performance, providing preliminary evidence to improve the applicability of the EAT-Lancet dietary pattern in individuals with HUA.
