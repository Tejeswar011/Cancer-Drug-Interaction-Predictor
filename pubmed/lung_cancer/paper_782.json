Drug resistance, co-morbidities, and limited availability of new rapid tests such as the GeneXpert/MTB Rif assay make diagnosis and treatment of extrapulmonary tuberculosis burdensome. A cross-sectional study was carried out at Employees’ State Insurance Corporation Medical College and Hospital, Faridabad, Haryana of patients treated for tubercular cervical lymphadenopathy from December 2021 to March 2023 in the department of ENT. This study included 58 patients. The clinicopathological profile of patients and the outcome of treatment with antitubercular therapy were noted. The majority of patients had level V (39.6%) involvement. Incidental diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was seen in 2 cases (3.4%). Fever was the commonest constitutional symptom observed in 27.5% of cases. FNAC was suggestive of tubercular abscess in 48.2% and the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay detected Mycobacterial tuberculosis in all the cases with rifampicin resistance in only one case. 56 cases (96.5%) had complete resolution after completion of antitubercular therapy including patients with rifampicin resistance and patients with diabetes mellitus. In the remaining two cases, treatment was prolonged for a few months before the resolution of the disease was observed. Timely diagnosis, patient compliance to antitubercular therapy, and adequate management of comorbidities lead to successful treatment outcomes in tubercular cervical lymphadenitis. Delayed response to treatment in a few cases needs further research into factors like immune status, nutrition, living conditions, and quality of drugs available to the public.
