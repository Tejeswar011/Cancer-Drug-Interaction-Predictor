Once introduced into the cell, siRNAs will be processed and loaded onto the RNA‐induced silencing complex (RISC), which will cleave mRNAs complementary to the guide RNA strand, thus leading to gene silencing. [  1 ] [  2 ] [  3 ] [  4 ] [  5 ] [  6 ] [  5  6 ] Here, we developed a protein‐based RNAi therapeutics delivery platform that is modular and customizable, potentially complementing existing delivery technologies in targeting extrahepatic tissues. Our siRNA delivery platform contains a heteroheptameric scaffold modified from a U‐rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (snRNP), which consists of 7 Sm proteins binding to a U‐rich consensus sequence inserted into the siRNA. We henceforth call it Sm‐siRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (SmiRNP). Each Sm protein is unique and has 2 termini (N and C) available for protein fusion. The multimeric core serves as a scaffold for fusing up to possibly 14 functional protein modules to target different tissues and cross biological hurdles. The delivery platform is largely made of human proteins for biocompatibility. As proof‐of‐concept, we demonstrate that the SmiRNP can deliver siRNA to silence KRAS 2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Design and Reconstitution of SmiRNP We envisioned the human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs) as a starting point for engineering a modular siRNA delivery agent because snRNPs contain small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), [  7 ] [  7  8 ] [  7a,d ] [  7a,d ] [  7  9 ] To remodel a snRNP into a ribonucleoprotein complex that can bind siRNA (SmiRNP), we modified the U4 snRNP core ( Figure  1 KRAS S2 [  7  10 ] [  11 ] [  12 ] 1‐95 1‐95 1‐95 Figure  2 2A Figure 1 Design Concept of SmiRNP as an siRNA delivery agent. SmiRNPs are reconstituted by complexing siRNA containing a U‐rich sequence recognized by a combination of seven different Sm core proteins (SmD1/SmD2, SmD3/SmB 1‐95 1‐95 Figure 2 Size exclusion chromatography and negative stain electron microscopy characterization of the in vitro reconstituted SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E.

The analytical size exclusion chromatography profiles of the complexes incubated at 4 °C and room temperature were similar to that of the freshly assembled SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E control (Figure S3 To characterize the structure of SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E, we performed negative stain electron microscopy of the SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E complex. The negatively stained electron micrographs of SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E presented a homogeneous spread of particles of ≈80 Å in diameter (Figure 2B 2C S4 2C [  7  9 ] [  7a ] [  7a ] 2D 2D 2.2 SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E Silences KRAS We next sought to demonstrate that the reconstituted SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E complex can silence KRAS G13D [  15 ] m KRAS KRAS 50 m Figure  3 m KRAS KRAS Figure 3 In vitro analyses of the gene silencing efficacy, cancer cell cytotoxicity, and stability of SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E.

We reconstituted three different versions of SmiRNPs carrying a fluorescent‐tagged 5′‐FAM‐siKRAS: 1) SmiRNP without EGF and H5E (FAM‐SmiRNP); 2) SmiRNP with EGF (FAM‐SmiRNP‐EGF); and 3) SmiRNP with both EGF and H5E (FAM‐SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E) (Figure S1A–C For the 6 h time point, we observed FAM fluorescence signals in cells treated with FAM‐SmiRNP‐EGF and FAM‐SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E, but not in cells treated with FAM‐SmiRNP and the FAM‐siKRAS alone ( Figure  4 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A Figure 4 Cellular uptake of SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E by EGFR‐mediated endocytosis. A) Co‐localization studies of SmiRNPs by confocal microscopy. HCT116 cells were incubated with 5′‐FAM labelled siKRAS (green) alone or various SmiRNPs containing a 5′‐FAM labelled siKRAS (green) for 6 and 18 h, stained with Hoeschst 33342 (blue) for the nuclei and Lysotracker Red for lysosomes (red) before being visualized by confocal microscopy. Note that cells treated with SmiRNPs containing EGF showed enhanced FAM signals (green) in the cells, indicating cellular uptake, while SmiRNP containing both EGF and H5E did not present co‐localization of siKRAS (green) and lysosome (red), suggesting endosomal escape.

HCT116 cells incubated with SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E exhibited lower K‐Ras levels relative to the buffer control (Figure 3D S1D S1E S1F 3D To quantify the uptake of FAM‐siKRAS by HCT116, we performed flow cytometry and compared their mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of cells incubated with FAM‐siKRAS, FAM‐SmiRNP, FAM‐SmiRNP‐EGF, FAM‐SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E, and buffer. The results showed that the FAM‐SmiRNP‐EGF and FAM‐SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E samples showed higher MFI (470 ± 27 and 577 ± 12, respectively) than SmiRNP (without EGF) (298 ± 57) while buffer and siKRAS showed very minimal MFIs (27 ± 5 and 27 ± 5) (Figure 4B S5 S6A 4B S5 KRAS S6B–D To demonstrate that SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E can be uptaken by another cell line that expresses EGFR, we tested SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E on a pancreatic cancer cell line (Panc 02.03) that expresses EGFR (Figure S6A KRAS G12D KRAS KRAS 4C 4D 4E KRAS 2.4 SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E Protects siKRAS From Serum Nucleases We then considered the stability of the siKRAS when delivered by SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E via the bloodstream, which contains serum nucleases.

As each Sm protein is unique, in theory, there are 12 more vacant sites for protein fusion, considering the possibilities of fusing polypeptides onto the N‐ and C‐termini of each Sm protein. Both termini of the Sm protein are exposed on the side of the Sm ring away from the siRNA duplex, and therefore protein fusion would not interfere with RNA binding (Figure S10 1‐95 4 Experimental Section Expression and Purification of HIS‐SUMO‐SmD1/SmD2, His‐SUMO‐SmD1/SmD2‐EGF, His‐SUMO‐SmD1/SmD2‐FGF1 or His‐SUMO‐SmD1/SmD2‐VEGF‐A SmD1 was cloned into the pET28a vector with an N‐terminal 6xHis‐SUMO tag. SmD2, SmD2‐EGF, SmD2‐FGF1, or SmD2‐VEGF‐A was cloned into the pCDFDuet‐1 (MCS2) vector. The SmD2‐EGF, SmD2‐FGF1, and SmD2‐VEGF‐A fusion proteins contain a linker with the amino acid sequence GGSGGS in between SmD2 and EGF, FGF1, or VEGF‐A.

The HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (16600082, Gibco), the SW620 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium (12100061, Gibco), and the Panc 02.03 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (31800089, Gibco). All the media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, A5256701, Gibco) and 1x Antibiotic‐Antimycotic (15240062, Gibco). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 Quantification of KRAS mRNA Expression Levels Using RT‐qPCR The HCT116, SW620, or Panc 02.03 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of SmiRNP, SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E, SmiRNP‐FGF1‐H5E, SmiRNP‐VEGF‐A‐H5E, component proteins, siKRAS, or buffer. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were lysed with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Direct‐zol RNA Miniprep Kit (R2052, Zymo Research), following the manufacturer's protocol. 500 ng of each extracted RNA sample was reverse‐transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (RR037A, Takara). RT‐qPCR was performed on a StepOnePlus Real‐Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (1725124, Bio‐Rad). PCR reactions were performed in duplicates at 95 °C for 3 min, and 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, for 40 cycles. For in vivo studies, tumor tissues were homogenized in the TRIzol reagent using a tissue homogenizer (Servicebio, China). The homogenization was carried out in three cycles, each lasting 15 s at 60 Hz, with a 10 s pause between cycles. Total RNA was then extracted and reverse‐transcribed as described above. RT‐qPCR analyses were performed in duplicates with the same reaction and thermocycling conditions as described above using a ViiA 7 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences corresponding to KRAS KRAS ACTB Analyses of K‐Ras Protein Levels by Immunoblotting (Western Blot) The HCT116, SW620, or Panc 02.03 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of SmiRNP‐EGF‐H5E, SmiRNP‐FGF1‐H5E, SmiRNP‐VEGF‐A‐H5E, component proteins, siKRAS, or buffer. After 48 h of incubation, the cell pellets were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and lysed with the RIPA lysis buffer on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15600 rcf at 4 °C for 15 min. The protein concentrations were determined using the Quick Start Bradford protein assay kit (5000205, Bio‐Rad). The samples were subjected to 10% SDS‐PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (1620177, Bio‐Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% blocking buffer (1X Tris‐buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then probed with diluted anti‐K‐Ras primary recombinant rabbit mAb (11H35L14, Invitrogen, 1:500), anti‐β‐actin (C4) primary mouse mAb (sc‐47778, Santa Cruz, 1:1000), and anti‐GAPDH (G‐9) primary mouse mAb (sc‐365062, Santa Cruz, 1:1000) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the membranes were washed with Tris‐buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 10 min for a total of three times. The membranes were then probed with corresponding diluted secondary antibodies using goat anti‐mouse IgG (1706515, Bio‐Rad, 1:3000) or goat anti‐rabbit IgG (1721011, Bio‐Rad, 1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed again with TBST buffer three times. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using Immobilon Forte Western HRP Substrate (WBLUF0500, Millipore) with ChemiDoc imaging System (Bio‐Rad, USA). The protein bands were further analyzed using Image J. For in vivo studies, tissue lysates were prepared using the RIPA lysis buffer, followed by homogenization. Western blot assays were performed as described above. The primary antibody for K‐Ras (11H35L14, Invitrogen, 1:500) was used to probe the membranes. The anti‐𝛼‐actinin (sc‐17829, Santa Cruz, 1:1000) was used as the loading control. Cell Viability Assay The HCT116, SW620, or Panc 02.03 cells were separately treated with SmiRNP, component proteins, siRNA, or buffer at indicated concentrations in triplicate in a 96‐well plate.
