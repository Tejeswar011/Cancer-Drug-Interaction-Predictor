Introduction Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, resulting in impaired ion transport in different organs and tissues, including respiratory, hepatobiliary, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems, as well as pancreas and sweat glands, making CF a multisystem disease [ 1 Additionally, CF has historically been associated with malnutrition and progressive deterioration in nutritional status [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 8 5 9 Classically, malnutrition has been defined by body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m 2 9 10 Anthropometrical measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) have been validated in CF [ 2 6 2 9 However, there is no single parameter that accurately reflects nutritional status. Therefore, those body composition measurements and techniques that are practical, sensitive, and specific, while aligning with other tools, are of significant importance [ 11 12 13 14 13 In line with the above, our hypothesis is that CT could be an appropriate technique for measuring muscle mass in the nutritional assessment of PwCF, and that it would have good agreement with other diagnostic tools. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of CT for malnutrition diagnosis in PwCF, comparing the results with other body composition techniques such as anthropometry, BIA, handgrip strength, and nutritional ultrasound, as well as to determine its relationship with respiratory and nutritional status. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethics This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Malaga on 30 March 2021 (reference number #30032021). All subjects received a full explanation of the study objectives and procedures, and signed the informed consent form before participating. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.2. Study Design and Participants This was a cross-sectional observational study of routine clinical practice, conducted at two centers: the Hospital Regional Universitario de Malaga and the Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío. Adult PwCF in a clinically stable situation assessed at the Nutrition Unit were selected. We included subjects who had undergone a CT scan that included T12 within the 6 months before or after our assessment. Exclusion criteria included hospitalization or respiratory exacerbation at the time of CT performance, lung transplantation, or treatment modification, especially initiation of ETI, between our assessment and the CT scan, so 55 PwCF were finally included ( Figure 1 2.3. Morphofunctional Assessment Nutritional assessment included the following: Height, weight, and BMI. Skinfold thickness of triceps, biceps, subscapularis, and supra-iliac regions using constant-pressure calipers Holtain (Holtain Limited, Crymych, UK) or Harpenden (Realmet Institute, Vic, Spain). Fat mass and FFM were estimated according to the formulas of Siri and Durnin [ 15 16 BIA using TANITA MC980MA (TANITA Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to assess total body composition, including raw phase angle, fat mass, and FFM. FFM index (FFMI) was calculated for anthropometry and BIA. Low FFMI was defined according to Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) consensus [ 17 Handgrip strength measurement using a Jamar dynamometer (Asimow Engineering Co., Los Angeles, CA, USA). For patients assessed at the Hospital Regional Universitario de Malaga, muscle ultrasonography of rectus femoris muscle using a 10–12 MHz probe and an Esaote MyLab Gamma device (Esaote, Genova, Italy). Measurements were acquired at point one third of the distance along a line drawn from the upper edge of the patella to the anterosuperior iliac spine, without applying pressure with the probe. Parameters measured included X Y 18 2.4. Computed Tomography (CT) Image Analysis Body composition was assessed using CT images acquired as part of routine clinical practice. CT image processing was performed using FocusedON-BC software from ARTIS Development (version 1.0). This software incorporates an artificial intelligence-assisted semiautomatic labeling tool able to perform body mass segmentation automatically. Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholds used for segmentation are as follows: −29 to +150 for muscle mass, −190 to −30 for subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), and −150 to −50 for visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Cross-sectional areas (cm 2 Once CT images were uploaded, we selected the CT slice at the midpoint level of T12 and processed it, with manual adjustments if needed. Thus, since the primary function of FocusedON-BC is to accelerate the image analysis by providing an initial segmentation that the researcher can then validate and, if necessary, correct, human judgment prevails as the final authority, eliminating any potential bias that the model may have introduced. We obtained the area, percentage, and mean HU of both muscle and adipose tissue, including IMAT, SAT, and VAT. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was calculated from muscle area and height. Additionally, FocusedON-BC provides graphical information that allows a quick qualitative overview of the results ( Figure 2 2.5. Assessment of Nutritional Status Malnutrition was defined according to GLIM criteria, for which the presence of at least one phenotypic criterion and one etiologic criterion was required. All patients were found to meet at least one etiological criterion, as CF is considered a chronic inflammatory condition. Regarding phenotypic criteria, patients were identified based on unintentional weight loss higher than 5% in 6 months, BMI below 20 kg/m 2 17 2.6. Assessment of Respiratory Status Respiratory exacerbations occurring within the year prior to the evaluation were classified as mild/moderate or severe (if required hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotics). Spirometry was performed using a JAEGER pneumotachograph (Jaeger Oxycon Pro ® 19 Initial microorganism colonization was determined by the presence of at least three positive sputum cultures, regardless of their persistence at the time of this study. Pulmonary radiological severity was evaluated by a radiologist with expertise in thoracic radiology using Bhalla score [ 20 2.7. Statistical Analysis We estimated that, to assess correlations of at least r Qualitative variables are expressed as absolute values and percentages. Differences between qualitative variables were analyzed using Chi-squared or Fisher tests. Quantitative variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Differences between quantitative variables were analyzed using Student’s t p The diagnostic performance of CT parameters to detect malnutrition was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC). Data analysis was performed using Jamovi version 2.3.2. 3. Results A total of 55 patients were included. They had a mean age of 31.2 ± 9.3 years. A total of 33 were men (60%) and 22 were women (40%). A proportion of 43.6% of the individuals in our sample were heterozygous for ΔF508, and 69.1% had pancreatic insufficiency. They had a mean FEV1 of 66.8 ± 25.2% and a mean Bhalla score of 12.8 ± 5.1, without statistically significant differences in respiratory status between the Hospital Regional Universitario de Malaga and the Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío (FEV1 of 64.4 ± 28% vs. 69.1 ± 22.6%, p p Only 5 (9.1%) patients had a BMI lower than 18.5 kg/m 2 2 Their general features are depicted in Table 1 3.1.

Discussion To our knowledge, there are few studies evaluating the usefulness of CT image analysis, used opportunistically, in PwCF. In our study, we observed that body composition parameters derived from T12 CT image analysis correlate well with anthropometry, BIA, handgrip strength, and ultrasonography in PwCF. In turn, we found an association between this tool and respiratory parameters and nutritional status. Our sample comprises PwCF recruited from two hospitals, yet demonstrating homogeneous respiratory status across both centers. Their general characteristics closely resemble those reported in a larger multicenter Spanish study [ 21 22 7 23 24 25 6 23 2 25 9 However, no single method is considered the gold standard for body composition assessment in PwCF [ 25 26 Our study found good correlations between CT parameters and other body composition tools in PwCF. In a previous study in CF, Bryl et al. [ 27 r r 28 29 r r r In our study, a notable association was observed between CT image analysis and respiratory parameters. Specifically, patients with a worse Bhalla score seemed to have lower values of lean mass-related parameters in all the techniques performed, including CT analysis. While causal relationships cannot be established, these findings align with existing evidence highlighting skeletal muscle mass as a valuable prognostic indicator in chronic respiratory diseases, including CF [ 27 FEV1 correlated with Bhalla score in our study, as previously reported [ 21 r 27 21 Finally, we also found an association between CT image analysis and nutritional status: malnourished patients presented a significantly lower muscle area and SMI in CT. The results of our ROC curve for predicting malnutrition using these T12 CT parameters align with those previously obtained at the same vertebral level in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (muscle area of 80.5 cm 2 2 2 29 2 2 30 Artificial intelligence-assisted CT image analysis is an emerging technique. L3 is currently considered the reference for CT-based body composition assessment [ 31 32 33 34 27 13 35 r r 36 r Based on our experience, since FocusedON-BC is a software tool that enables the extraction of nutritional information from an imaging test originally requested for a different purpose, analyzing these images using this software may serve as a useful screening approach to detect malnutrition without the need for the patient to be present. However, although FocusedON-BC has proven its effectiveness and reliability in several clinical studies, further research is required to validate this new tool. This study had some limitations. Firstly, our sample size was relatively modest. As our study took place under routine clinical practice, the dates of CT scans did not coincide with those of the nutritional assessment. However, the estimated sample size was sufficiently met. Additionally, nutritional ultrasound was performed on a smaller sample of patients. However, the results are consistent with other measurements. Furthermore, the time elapsed between the CT scan and the assessment was up to 6 months, which may lead to minor changes during that period. As in any observational study, results should be interpreted within the appropriate population context, and causality can be suggested but not established. Finally, PwCF without CT scans performed during the established period were excluded, potentially leading to selection bias. Nonetheless, as strengths of our study, we highlight that it includes an innovative artificial intelligence-assisted assessment of body composition, aimed at reducing intra- and interindividual variability. Additionally, several body composition techniques were used, which enhances the reliability of the results and brings it closer to clinical practice. Furthermore, this study was conducted in two centers using the same methodology, which facilitates generalization of the results. The exclusion of patients with treatment modifications, especially initiation of ETI, between our assessment and the CT scan, also reduced the variability associated with the clinical and nutritional improvement observed with these treatments. Finally, as an opportunistic test, the proposed technique does not require additional patient evaluations. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, in adult PwCF, the assessment of body composition by CT image analysis correlates adequately with other body composition techniques such as anthropometry, BIA, handgrip strength, and nutritional ultrasound. Muscle area derived from CT analysis is related to the respiratory function and nutritional status of PwCF. However, further studies are required to validate this new tool and provide information on reference values, which could open a new avenue in the nutritional assessment of PwCF.
