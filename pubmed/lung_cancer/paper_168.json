Objective This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological features and prognosis of small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (SCCUB). Methods Clinicopathological data and prognosis of 24 patients with primary SCCUB treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (from January 2016 to December 2021) were retrospectively collected and compared with 335 patients with primary high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HG-UC) during the same period. The study endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results Of the 24 patients with SCCUB, 19 were male and five were female. Eight (33%) cases were pure SCCUB (pSCCUB). Sixteen (67%) cases were mixed SCCUB (mSCCUB), all of which were mixed with urothelial carcinoma. All patients underwent surgery and 13 (76%, 13/17; seven patients were lost to follow-up) patients received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. We found no significant difference in clinicopathological features between pSCCUB and mSCCUB. However, compared to HG-UC, SCCUB had higher lymph node metastasis ( p p p p p p Conclusion Compared with the common HG-UC, SCCUB is rare with specific clinicopathological features and a worse prognosis.

SCC of the urinary bladder (SCCUB) is rare and was first reported by Cramer et al. [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Due to the rarity and poor prognosis of SCCUB, the availability of clinical information and treatment data is limited and there is still no uniform standard treatment strategy. In addition, Koay et al. [ 8 9 2 2 Patients and methods 2.1 Patient characteristics and clinicopathological features This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (approval number: QYFY WZLL 27875), and included 24 patients with primary SCCUB and 335 patients with primary HG-UC treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University (from January 2016 to December 2021). Informed consent was obtained from all the participants. The clinicopathological information of patients was collected through the medical record system and pathological database of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, including age, gender, smoking history, tumor size, location, pathological stage, lymph node metastasis, muscle invasion, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), immunohistochemical expression (Syn, CgA, CD56, and Ki67), type of surgery, and postoperative treatment. The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. All cases were reviewed by two pathologists according to the International Union Against Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis Staging System (8th edition) and WHO 2022 genitourinary tumor classification diagnostic criteria. Immunohistochemistry results were interpreted as positive when stained and negative when not stained. The size of the primary bladder tumor was determined by measuring its length, width, and height during pathological sampling after the sample was surgically removed. The maximum diameter used for statistical analysis was the size of the tumor. CgA and Syn were located in the cytoplasm; CD56 was located in the cell membrane; and Ki67 was located in the nucleus. The study endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). DFS was defined as the time from surgery to disease progression (recurrence or metastasis) or death, while OS was defined as the time from surgery to death from any cause. The follow-up was performed using the medical record system or by telephone, and the last follow-up was in April 2023. 2.2 Statistical analysis Continuous variables are presented as means with standard deviations (SDs). The Chi-squared test (categorical variables), Fisher's exact test (categorical variables), or t p p 3 Results 3.1 Patient characteristics Among the 24 SCCUB patients, the median age was 68.5 (range 55–85) years old, 19 (79%) were male and 5 (21%) were female, with a male to female ratio of 3.8:1. Eighteen (75%) patients presented with hematuria, and five (23%, 5/22; two patients had incomplete records) patients had a history of smoking. The median tumor size was 4.0 (range 1.5–10.4) cm. Eight (33%) cases were pure SCCUB (pSCCUB). Sixteen (67%) cases were mixed SCCUB (mSCCUB), all of which were mixed with urothelial carcinoma. Fig. 1 Supplementary Table 1 Figure 1 Typical HE staining and IHC images of SCCUB. (A) In pure SCCUB, tumor cells were distributed in a diffuse and nested pattern (HE, 100×), round or oval in shape, with sparse cytoplasm, high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, and inconspicuous nucleoli (HE, 400×); (B) The tumor cells exhibited cytokeratin-positive, perinuclear punctate staining (IHC, 200×); (C) The tumor cells exhibited ‌CgA-positive staining (IHC, 200×); (D) The tumor cells exhibited Syn-positive staining (IHC, 200×); (E) The tumor cells exhibited CD56-positive staining (IHC, 200×); (F) Ki67 positive expression was approximately 90% (IHC, 200×).

Figure 3 4 Discussion The 24 Chinese patients with SCCUB included in this study were mostly elderly men, which was consistent with most previous reports [ 7 10 2 2 p 3 9 [11] [12] [13] [14] 15 In general, several studies based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) dataset have provided a relatively comprehensive description of SCCUB [ 8 [16] [17] [18] [19] 8 8 18 18 20 In our study, the multivariate analysis showed that the tumor size was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in SCCUB patients, which was consistent with the results of the analysis of SCCUB in the SEER dataset by Mollica et al. [ 16 9 11 21 2 3 11 13 [22] [23] [24] 25 7 26 In addition, in our study, we found that metastatic SCCUB had a worse prognosis compared with metastatic HG-UC, but no significant difference was found in non-metastatic patients, which may be related to the sample size and follow-up time we collected. Meanwhile, we found that different proportions of small cells may affect the prognosis of SCCUB. Although the results showed significant differences, our findings still need further refinement due to the small sample size. 5 Conclusion This study reviewed the data of 24 Chinese SCCUB patients and found that the tumor size was an independent prognostic factor for DFS regardless of the pathological type and surgical type. SCCUB has unique clinicopathological features and a worse prognosis than common urothelial carcinoma. As a rare tumor with an unsatisfactory prognosis, the formulation of the optimal treatment strategy for SCCUB still needs to be supported by more relevant reports and clinical trial results.
