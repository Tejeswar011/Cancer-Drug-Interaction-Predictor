The present study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of a 12-week Technology-Enhanced Home Exercise and acupressure (TEHEplus) program to improve symptoms (fatigue, pain, sleep, anxiety, depression), social functioning, physical performance, and serum biomarkers (brain-derived neurotrophic factor, heat shock protein 90 levels.) Methods A two-phase design was employed. Phase 1 involved program development; Phase 2 was a pilot feasibility study. Participants with solid tumor cancers were recruited from cancer centers in Maryland and randomly assigned to four groups: Usual Care Control (UC), Technology-Enhanced Home Exercise (TEHE) alone, Acupressure alone (ACU), and TEHEplus. Feasibility was measured by enrollment duration, intervention adherence, and daily survey response rates. Outcomes were measured at baseline and program completion. Results In phase 1, four participants (age 56–82) provided feedback on online training, smartphone application, intervention duration, and outcome measures. In Phase 2, 40 participants (10 per group) were recruited over 12 months, with 43% ( n p p p p Conclusion TEHEplus is feasible and shows promise for symptom alleviation. Preliminary findings suggest potential benefits in symptom management and functional outcomes. However, further studies with larger and more diverse samples are warranted to explore its efficacy and generalizability.Further studies with larger, more diverse populations are needed to confirm its efficacy. TEHEplus may enhance symptom management and improve functional outcomes for cancer survivors undergoing immunotherapy.

Studies have shown potential benefits for fatigue [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effects of a combined personalized exercise and acupressure program on cancer-related symptoms. Combining these modalities and delivering them as one nonpharmacological intervention may synergistically address physical and psychological well-being by targeting the body’s meridians and energy flow. In addition, preliminary studies on exercise programs for patients with chronic fatigue have found elevated levels of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90), a molecular chaperone that stabilizes signaling proteins under stress [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 Methods Aims The aims of the present study was twofold:  to investigate the feasibility of administering a 12-week Technology-Enhanced Home Exercise. and acupressure (TEHEplus) program by the ability to recruit and deliver the program (duration to recruit 40 eligible participants into the program) and adherence to the program, and.  (2) to evaluate the effects of these programs in managing cancer-related symptoms (fatigue, pain, sleep, anxiety, depression), social function, physical performance, and serum biomarkers in. cancer survivors. We hypothesize that TEHEplus interventions will improve cancer-related symptoms, social functions, physical performance, and serum biomarkers more than exercise alone, acupressure alone, or usual care. The study will contribute valuable insights into the potential synergistic benefits of combining personalized exercise and acupressure modalities for enhancing the well-being of cancer survivors. Study design A two-phase interventional design was employed, comprising a program development phase (Phase 1) and a pilot feasibility study (Phase 2). The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB00154198) and registered in the National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03576274 38 Participants Participants were recruited from a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Maryland, U.S., between January 2022 and May 2023 using clinicians’ referrals, word of mouth, social media, and an EPIC-based recruitment platform (started in October 2022). The CONSORT Flow Diagram is presented in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 CONSORT flow diagram Phase 1: TEHEplus program development In the formative phase, four participants who met the inclusion criteria were invited to evaluate the combined 12-week TEHEplus program. This sample size aligns with recommendations from usability testing literature, which suggests that 3 to 5 users are sufficient to identify the majority of usability issues during each iteration [ 39 Phase 2: pilot and feasibility testing Study design A four-arm pilot randomized controlled trial was used to examine the program’s feasibility among 40 cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. Randomization After the participants had signed the consent form and completed the baseline study visit, a total of 40 participants were randomly assigned into four interventional groups: Usual Care Control (UC), TEHE alone, Acupressure alone (ACU), and a combination of TEHE and acupressure (TEHEplus) using a stratified, sequential assignment approach with balanced quotas (maximum n Interventions Common procedure All interventions were delivered remotely (home-based). Participants received a welcome package, including a PA tracker and instructions for setting up the PA tracker and the TEHEplus app on a smartphone. Participants in the ACU and TEHEplus groups received an acupressure kit in addition to the welcome package. All participants were asked to wear PA trackers 24 h/day and respond to the daily symptoms survey during the 12-week program. To capture real-time variations in daily symptom and functioning, we implemented Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) strategies through the app. Participants received daily notifications prompting them to complete the symptom survey through the app for 91 days. The survey included 13 symptoms—pain, difficulty sleeping, difficulty falling asleep, lack of physical energy, feeling sluggish, feeling tense, feeling blue, constipation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, numbness in fingers, and skin changes or rash—rated on a 4-point scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe). These daily EMA entries were used to generate weekly performance summaries that included step count, sleep duration, and symptom patterns and adjust the exercise goals and acupressure recommendations. Personalized weekly physical performance reports summarizing the average steps, sleep duration, and symptoms of concern based on the data from the PA tracker and EMA entries were sent to the participants weekly through the TEHEplus app to help them tracking progress and support engagement. Figure 2 Fig. 2 TEHEplus application flow Technology-enhanced home exercise (TEHE) alone Participants received one virtual visit from an exercise physiologist and/or trained research staff to assess physical function, exercise preferences, and barriers. PA recommendations tailored based on their preference, PA level, and weekly goal achievement assessed in the past week were sent weekly. At the end of each week, participants were asked to complete the achievement survey to rate overall improvement, self-perceptions of the goal achievement, and the rate of perceived exertion (Borg scale) of the recommended exercises. The decision on exercise adjustments is explained in Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Personalized weekly exercise recommendation decision tree. (a) Initial exercise prescription based on baseline activity levels for week 1. (b) ​Individualized exercise prescription for week 2–12 Acupressure (ACU) alone Participants received auricular acupressure toolkits that included ear seeds, an ear probe, and alcohol pads for ear cleaning. They then attended one online or in-person training session with trained research staff and weekly acupoints recommendations. The training session covered both auricular and body acupressure techniques and included guidance on locating, placing ear seeds, and stimulating the acupoints (how often, duration, and procedure of applying pressure for each seed). To ensure that participants could follow the recommendations at home, they were encouraged to have a caregiver or family member attend the training session to assist with seed placement and stimulation. After the training, participants were asked to apply the ear seeds and send photos of the seed placement to the trained research staff to confirm the seed location through the TEHEplus app. During the first four weeks, the weekly acupoints recommendation focused on energy-related acupoints, including auricular points ( sympathetic liver spleen kidney mouth Shenmen anxious point Outer Gate [Waiguan: SJ5] Spirit Gate [Heart 7: HT7]) 40 4 Fig. 4 Personalized weekly acupressure recommendation diagram.

Weekly feedback surveys allowed participants to track their progress and provided insights into their seed placement proficiency and acupoint stimulation frequency. Control Arm The participants in the usual care control group were instructed to continue their usual PA routine. Data collection and measures Demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline (T1) to describe participant characteristics. Demographic variables included age (in years), gender (male or female), race (White, African American, or Other), education level (measured in years of formal education), employment status (categorized as full-time, retired, disabled, or other), and marital status (never married, married, domestic partnership, or divorced/separated/widowed). Clinical variables included cancer site, which encompassed a range of primary diagnoses such as metastatic, breast, prostate, lung, colon, kidney, liver, pancreas, and others (e.g., cervical, liposarcoma, lymphoma). Year since diagnosis was reported as a continuous variable. Participants were also asked about current treatment modalities, which allowed for multiple concurrent treatments and included chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation, and other therapies. The primary outcome was the program’s feasibility, measured by (1) the ability to recruit and deliver the program (duration to recruit 40 eligible participants into the program) and (2) adherence to the program. The recruitment was evaluated by the number of participants screened, eligible, and those who declined participation, along with their rationales. Adherence to the daily data collection was measured by completing the daily data steps information from the PA tracker and daily symptom surveys for the 91 days during the program. The adherence rate for weekly recommendations for exercise and acupoints was measured from the participants’ self-report of weekly goals achievement from 0 (not at all achieving the goals) to 10 (completely achieving the recommended goals). The percentage of weeks in which participants achieved at least 50% of the recommended goals in 12 weeks was calculated. The outcomes for the second aim, including symptoms (fatigue, pain, sleep, anxiety, depression), social functions, physical performance, and biomarker serum, were measured at baseline and after the 12-week program. The PROMIS-29 Health Profile version 2.0 was employed to assess seven domains: pain interference, physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbances, the ability to engage in social roles and activities (as an indicator of social functioning), and pain intensity using five response options (1–5) [ 41 41 42 Physical performance was assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) [ 43 44 45 45 44 44 46 47 Peripheral venous blood was collected in serum tubes for plasma HSP90 and BDNF analysis both before the intervention and after its completion. The serum samples were stored at − 80 °C following centrifugation until analysis. The samples were then batch processed by a technician who was blinded to the study design and group assignment using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Single Plex assay kits to measure BDNF and HSP90 levels at the Oncology Center laboratory core at a comprehensive cancer center in Baltimore, Maryland. All samples were run in duplicate, and a five-parameter regression formula was used to calculate the sample concentrations based on the standard curves. Statistical methods Descriptive statistics (e.g., frequency, mean, and standard deviation) were used to describe the feasibility of the program. Comparisons among the four groups were carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The differences between the baseline and end of the program (week 12) were analyzed using the Wilcoxon-Signed Rank test. Cohen’s d effect sizes were also calculated to assess the magnitude of change. Due to the small sample size, an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach was used for the primary analysis. Additionally, chaeacteristic comparisons between participants who completed the follow-up survey and those who did not were conducted using Student’s t-test for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables to evaluate potential attrition bias. SPSS version 27 (SPSS, Chicago IL, USA) and Stata/BE 17.0 (StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA) were used to conducted the analysis. A p Results Phase 1 Three females and one male participant receiving passive immunotherapy (e.g., trastuzumab and Pertuzumab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor (Nivolumab), and cancer vaccine (Sipuleucel-T) for breast, prostate, and brain cancers were invited to the development phase. Baseline ranged from 3 to 5 out of 10, and SPPB scores were high, ranging from 11 to 12. Cognitive function was mostly normal, except for one participant with mild impairment (MoCA score of 23). Daily step counts also varied widely, from 1822 to 8024 steps per day, highlighting differences in baseline activity levels. After completing the 12-week program, participants had a positive experience with the personalized program, the integration of personalized exercise and acupressure, which allowed participants to increase the intensity of the exercise gradually while continuously monitoring their physical activity and sleep data. The mobile technologies used, including the TEHEplus smartphone application and the PA tracker, were easy to set up and follow. The daily surveys, weekly intervention recommendations, and weekly health tips were well received. Several suggestions included: (1) creating video instructions on how to locate acupoints; (2) offering in-person acupressure training for participants who had difficulty with the acupressure; (3) creating an instructional package and page that includes frequently asked questions with their corresponding answers; and (4) updating the app to allow participants to upload pictures and long text to communicate with the study team.

The feasibility of our program was evaluated by the ability to recruit and deliver the program within a 12-month timeframe, overall acceptability, and participant adherence. Of 179 individuals screened, 56 (31.3%) were eligible, with 16 declining participation due to progression of the disease, overwhelming adverse events from the treatment, inability to commit to the program, etc. Ultimately, 40 participants consented, completed baseline assessments, and were randomly assigned to one of the four groups. Adherence to the daily data collection using mobile technologies was generally acceptable (range from 60 to 99% data completion). In this study, we found participants in the control group to have the highest dropout rate and lowest adherence rate in responding to the daily survey (65%) and wearing the physical activity tracker (65%). Althought, there was no significantly different in terms of characteristics among those who dropout and completer. The adherence rate of our participants to the exercise program was similar (60–65%) to the exercise adherence rate of patients with advanced cancer [ 48 49 The findings indicate a potential effect of the TEHEplus intervention in reducing both fatigue and pain interference. The reduction in pain interference may suggest that the integration of TEHE and acupressure may help alleviate pain more effectively. A systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that the effect of exercise alone on cancer-related pain was minimal [ 50 51 25 52 53 54 Regarding physiological outcomes, the study found no significant changes in serum BDNF or HSP90 levels observed following the 12-week intervention. These findings may reflect the limited intensity or duration of the intervention to induce detectable molecular changes. Prior studies suggest that BDNF responses to exercise are often transient and influenced by exercise type, frequency, and individual health status [ 55 56 57 Our study is among the few that exploring the feasibility and potential benefits of the combination of personalized exercise and acupressure using mobile technologies for real-time monitoring and recommendations. Moreover, the improvements in the social function in both the TEHE and TEHEplus groups may indicate that these interventions could positively influence psychosocial functioning, thereby potentially enhancing patients’ quality of life. However, given the small sample size and the study’s feasibility design, these clinical observations should be interpreted as exploratory rather than definitive evidence of efficacy. Future adequately powered trials are needed to evaluate the intervention’s clinical impact. This study demonstrates several preliminary strengths of the combined personalized exercise and acupressure program. We employed a comprehensive approach and a randomized control design to assess the feasibility and potential outcomes. The intervention and mobile technologies were developed and refined based on participants’ experiences and suggestions, which demonstrate a responsive and patient-centric approach. Secondly, the study included participants with different solid tumor types and various immunotherapy regimens, adding diversity to the sample. This diversity allows for insights into the potential applicability of the TEHEplus program across a range of cancer treatment scenarios. Finally, the study’s incorporation of technology, such as the TEHEplus smartphone app, PA tracker, and daily surveys, reflects a contemporary, interactive, and innovative approach. This technology integration not only facilitates data collection but also enhances participant engagement and empowerment through features like personalized exercise recommendations and health tips. Limitations As a pilot feasibility study, this trial was primarily designed to evaluate the acceptability, practicality, and preliminary effects of the TEHEplus intervention, rather than to determine definitive efficacy. Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the relatively small sample size (40 participants in Phase 2) limits generalizability to the broader population of cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, although this is appropriate for a feasibility trial. Second, the recruitment method, which included clinician referrals, word of mouth, social media, and an EPIC-based recruitment platform, may introduce selection bias, as volunteers might be more motivated or have different characteristics than those who did not participate, affecting the generalizability. Third, the study’s reliance on self-reported data also introduces the possibility of response bias and may not fully capture objective measures of physical and cognitive functions. Forth, while the use of EMA through daily symptom surveys was valuable for capturing real-time symptom fluctuations and enabling personalized feedback and tailored goal setting, it may have also contributed to participant burden. The daily reporting requirement could have affected retention, particularly among individuals already experiencing significant fatigue or other distressing symptoms [ 58 59 Fifth, although we provided clear illustrated instructions, an ear probe, and individualized feedback on seed placement, the self-administration of auricular point acupressure may still pose challenges. This is particularly relevant for participants with visual or dexterity impairments. While we encouraged caregiver involvement in training to support feasibility, the sufficiency of a single session may still be a limitation. Sixth, participants in this study tended to have relatively high socioeconomic status. This may indicate that the program is more likely to attract individuals with greater access to resources and comfort with technology and self-guided interventions. As a result, the generalizability of the findings may be limited for individuals with lower educational attainment or reduced digital health literacy. Lastly, the study lacks a long-term follow-up, limiting insights into the program’s lasting impact on participant outcomes beyond the 12-week intervention period. Future research should consider a larger, multicenter study with a more diverse participant pool to enhance the generalizability of the findings across demographic and geographical contexts. Future studies should also explore the long-term effects of the TEHEplus program beyond the 12 weeks to assess the sustainability of the intervention and its impact on participants’ well-being. Additionally, incorporating objective measures alongside self-reported data, such as clinical assessments of physical and cognitive functions, could bolster the scientific rigor of the research and offer a more comprehensive evaluation of program effectiveness. Furthermore, investigating the feasibility and acceptability of the TEHEplus program in more diverse cancer populations, including those in advanced stages or facing severe treatment-related complications, may offer insights into the program’s adaptability and potential benefits. Lastly, future research should explore the economic implications and cost-effectiveness of implementing such technology-enhanced interventions in the clinical setting, providing a holistic understanding of both clinical and practical outcomes. Conclusion The present study provides preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and safety of a personalized exercise and acupressure program, enhanced by mobile technologies, to manage distressing symptoms in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. The TEHEplus intervention was associated with reductions in fatigue and pain interference and may support improvements in the ability to participate in social roles, suggesting it could be a practical holistic approach to symptom management. Using mobile technologies to track adherence and provide real-time, personalized recommendations may further enhance the program’s flexibility and engagement.
