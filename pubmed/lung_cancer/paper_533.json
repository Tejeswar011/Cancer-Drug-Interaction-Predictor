Methods: We used a post-publication dataset made available by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Research (CIBMTR) including patients who were ≥65 years in age with PCNSL and underwent autoHCT as consolidation with TBC or BCNU/Thio conditioning. Results: Out of 147 patients; n=84 received BCNU/Thio and n=63 received TBC. The 1-year NRM in the BCNU/Thio group was 10% versus 22% in the TBC group (p=0.05) and the 2-year relapse rate was 5% versus 5%, respectively (p=1.00). The 2-year PFS in the BCNU/Thio group was 85% versus 71% in the TBC group (p=0.05) and 2-year OS was 86% vs 74% (p=0.08). In a multivariable regression model, BCNU/Thio was associated with a lower risk for NRM [Hazard Ratio (HR), 0.33, p=0.009], improved PFS (HR, 0.41, p=0.008) and OS (HR, 0.37, p=0.007), but there was no association with relapse risk. Conclusion: We found that in older adults with PCNSL undergoing consolidation with autoHCT, BCNU/Thio conditioning is associated with lower NRM and improved OS compared to TBC.
