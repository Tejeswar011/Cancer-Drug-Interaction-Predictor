Background Inhalational exposures in the operating theatre, such as waste anaesthetic gases, surgical smoke, airborne particles, \nmicrobiological contaminants and cleaning agents, may compromise lung function. Objectives To evaluate pulmonary function test (PFT) values of operating theatre staff who work in resource-constrained settings. Methods This comparative cross-sectional study included 184 participants (exposed and matched unexposed cohorts). Data were acquired \nvia a structured questionnaire, and the standard procedure was used to calculate each participant’s forced vital capacity (FVC), forced \nexpiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 1 Results The study cohort comprised 38 surgeons, 28 anaesthetists, 14 scrub nurses and 12 assistants, with a median age of 34 years. \nThe median age for the matched unexposed cohort was 33 years. The healthcare staff had significantly lower FEV 1 1 Conclusion The study showed that PFT values were considerably lower among operating theatre healthcare staff than in a matched \nunexposed group, with measures decreasing as staff experience/duration of exposure rose.

[1 2] [3] [3 5] Waste management, noise, infection control, radiation safety, \ngeneral building safety, water quality, heating, ventilation and air \nconditioning systems, and sewage treatment all have significant \neffects on complex hospital environments (which include patients, \nstaff, equipment, services and information). [6] [7 8] [9 10] [11] Additionally, the air in the operating theatre environment may \ncontain airborne particles such as skin cells, dust, lint carried on \nclothing, or respiratory droplets (mostly produced by the presence \nof medical staff) that may carry germs that are harmful to both \npatients and working personnel. [11] [12] [13] [14] Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) enable doctors to assess respiratory \nsystem function in a variety of clinical settings, including those \ninvolving risk factors for pulmonary illness, occupational exposure \nand pulmonary toxicity. [15] [16] [17] [18] Many studies have been undertaken at national and international \nlevels to investigate the effects of various occupational exposures on \nlung function. [19 21] Methods Study design, duration and setting This cross-sectional hospital-based study was carried out from October \nto December 2022 at Ibn-Sina Teaching Hospital and National Ribat \nUniversity Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Ibn Sina Teaching Hospital is a government tertiary referral hospital with specialist medical \nand surgical services such as gastroenterology and gastrointestinal \nhaemorrhage centres, urology, otolaryngology, nephrology, and \na kidney transplant facility. The hospital has two operating theatre \ncomplexes, each with three operating theatres. National Ribat \nUniversity Hospital is a government hospital that provides medical \nand surgical care. It has four operating theatre complexes, each with \nsix operating theatres. Study population and eligibility criteria The operating theatre personnel studied were surgeons, anaesthetists, \nscrub nurses and assistants (porters and cleaners). All were Sudanese \nadults aged ≥18 years who had worked in an operating theatre for \n≥3 hours per day, ≥3 days per week, for at least 1 year. Smokers (past \nor present), pregnant women, individuals on chronic therapy for \nany disease, those with known cardiopulmonary disease or other \nchronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, renal diseases, etc.), and \nthose with any contraindication to lung function tests (e.g. a history \nof eye, chest or abdominal surgery, haemoptysis, or pneumothorax, \nemboli or aneurysms; or current respiratory infection) were excluded. \nAdditionally, a comparison group of Sudanese adults matched for age, \nsex and height comprised postgraduate university students and arts \nfaculty staff who had no prior exposure to respiratory risks. Survey size determination The operating theatres at the two hospitals employed ~300 healthcare \npersonnel, of whom about half were excluded because of a history of \nsmoking (n=110), being a new employee (n=31) or having a history \nof chronic illness (n=11). The remaining 148 healthcare workers were \neligible to participate in the study. Data collection tool and procedure A structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic, \nanthropometric and respiratory health data. All the participants \nunderwent a general physical examination. Height (m) and weight \n(kg) were measured, and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated \n(weight (kg) divided by height (m²)). PFTs were done using an \nelectronic digital spirometer (pocket microspirometer D-97204 \n(VIASYS Healthcare GmbH, Germany)), following a standardised \nand updated American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory \nSociety (ATS/ERS) recommendation. [17] 1 1 1 1 1 Statistical analysis The data were analysed with SPSS version 25 (IBM, USA). The \ndistribution of the data was assessed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and \nShapiro-Wilk tests. Continuous variables were reported as medians \nand ranges, whereas categorical data were presented as frequencies \nand percentages. When comparing the results between the healthcare \nworkers and the matched unexposed cohort, the Mann-Whitney U-test \nand the Kruskal-Wallis test were employed. Furthermore, correlation \n(Spearman) analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were used \nto investigate the relationships between independent factors and PFT \nresults. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Ethical considerations All procedures involving human participants in this study followed \nethical standards established and approved by the research committee \nof the Faculty of Medicine at The National Ribat University in \nKhartoum, as well as the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent \namendments or comparable ethical standards. After a clear and basic \ndescription of the research technique and study objectives, each \nparticipant provided signed informed consent. The participants were \nassured that the information obtained would be kept confidential and \nused only for research purposes. Results The study included 184 participants (92 of the eligible 148 healthcare \nworkers, giving a response rate of 62%, and 92 in the matched \nunexposed cohort). The median age of the healthcare staff was \n34 years, with a range of 26 - 74 years, and that of the unexposed \ngroup 33 years, with a range of 26 - 74 years. The healthcare workers \nhad a median BMI of 25.7 kg/m² (range 20.1 - 31.6 kg/m²), whereas \nthe unexposed group had a median BMI of 26.8 kg/m² (range \n20.34 - 32.2 kg/m²). The healthcare workers comprised 38 surgeons, \n28 anaesthetists, 14 scrub nurses and 12 assistants (Table 1) 1 1 (Table 2) Assistants and scrub nurses had lower PFT values than the other \nhealthcare categories, and lower values than their matched groups (Table 3) (Table 4) Compared with those of the matched unexposed groups, the PFT \nvalues of healthcare workers significantly decreased as their duration \nof experience/exposure increased (Table 5) The duration of experience/exposure of healthcare personnel was \nstrongly correlated with and can be a predictor of decreased PFT \nvalues (Table 6) Table 1 Characteristics of the exposed and unexposed study participants  Variable  Healthcare staff (n=92), n (%)*  Matched unexposed group (n=92), n (%)*  Age (years), median (range) 34 (26 - 74) 33 (26 - 74)  Sex Male 64 (69.6) 60 (65.2) Female 28 (30.4) 32 (34.8)  BMI (kg/m²), median (range) 25.7 (20.1 - 31.6) 26.8 (20.3 - 32.2)  Job title Surgeon 38 (41.3) Postgraduate students and arts faculty staff Anaesthetist 28 (30.4) Scrub nurse 14 (15.3) Assistant 12 (13.0) BMI = body mass index * Except where otherwise indicated.

Spirometry results were \nsignificantly lower among healthcare staff than in the matched cohort. \nFurthermore, values decreased significantly as staff experience/\nexposure time increased. Occupational lung illnesses continue to contribute significantly \nto the respiratory disease burden worldwide, as they can cause \nrespiratory problems and limit economic productivity in young and \nhealthy populations. [22] [19 23] Our findings demonstrated decreased spirometric values among \noperating theatre staff. As we practise in a resource-limited setting, \npotential inhalational exposures such as waste anaesthetic gases, \nsurgical smoke, airborne particles, microbiological contamination \nand cleaning agents that affect lung function and result in such \nfindings are not unexpected. The waste anaesthetic concentrations \nof isoflurane and sevoflurane in unscavenged operating theatres have \nbeen reported to exceed permissible limits and have been linked to \nnegative health outcomes. [24] [25] Compared with other exposed staff, scrub nurses and assistants \nin the present study had lower PFT values. A study at a Brazilian \nuniversity hospital that used an infrared gas analyser to detect \nisoflurane contamination in the operating theatre revealed that \nthe areas of the operating theatre where specific healthcare staff \nare postioned are critical because the degree of gas accumulation \nvaries, with the majority of accumulation occurring in the breathing \ncorners of anaesthetists and surgeons. [26] [13] [14] [27] [28] Although the duration of experience/exposure was a significant \npredictor of poor PFT results among participants, such exposures \ncannot be prevented; rather, they should be managed and reduced \nto the lowest practicable level. Healthcare facilities must establish, \nimplement, monitor, advocate and oversee practices aimed at \neliminating hazardous work environments. [29] Conclusion Compared with the matched unexposed group, healthcare workers \nhad significantly poorer FEV 1 1 The datasets generated and analysed during the present \nstudy are available from the corresponding author (MAM) on reasonable \nrequest.
