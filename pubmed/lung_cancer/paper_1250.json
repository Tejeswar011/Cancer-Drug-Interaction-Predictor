Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep, resulting in intermittent hypoxia and disruption of normal sleep architecture [ 1 1 OSA represents a major public health concern, with a high and rising prevalence among adults [ 2 3 4 1 3 The severity of OSA is defined by the frequency of apneic and hypopneic events per hour, as assessed by polysomnography [ 5 5 Fluctuating oxygen concentrations, arising from alternating periods of hypoxia and reoxygenation, promote the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 6 7 8 9 8 9 Intermittent oxygen deprivation also provokes the release of proinflammatory mediators [ 6 10 The membrane-bound full-length receptor for advanced glycation end products (flRAGE) and its soluble isoform (sRAGE) are recognized as key mediators of inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways [ 11 11 11 12 13 In contrast to flRAGE, sRAGE lacks intracellular signalling domains and is therefore unable to initiate downstream cellular responses. Instead, sRAGE is thought to mitigate ligand-induced oxidative and inflammatory effects by functioning as a decoy receptor [ 13 13 Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays a central role in numerous biological processes, including embryonic development, immune regulation, wound healing, angiogenesis, fibroblast activation, and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis between proliferation and apoptosis [ 14 14 14 14 12 flRAGE and TGF-β1 interact through complex signalling networks that are not yet fully elucidated. They modulate each other’s activity while also acting independently on distinct molecular targets [ 13 14 15 15 Despite considerable advances in understanding OSA, the precise biological mechanisms underlying its associated complications remain incompletely elucidated. Deciphering these complex pathways and identifying novel biomarkers may enable the development of more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, the present study aimed to investigate the associations between redox status, proinflammatory biomarkers, and gene expression profiles with both the presence and severity of OSA. By applying statistical approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic regression, we sought to identify key predictive factors for OSA and gain further insight into the potential molecular mechanisms driving the condition. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Participants Between November 2016 and December 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving adult patients referred for polysomnography at the University Hospital Medical Centre Bežanijska kosa in Belgrade, within the Pulmonology Department. The study population comprised male and female patients aged 20 years or older, who exhibited a suspected diagnosis of OSA and provided informed consent to participate. Patients presenting with central sleep apnea, inherited metabolic disorders, or currently using antidepressants and/or sedatives at the time of screening were excluded from the study. A total of 167 participants met the eligibility criteria; of these, 125 were diagnosed with OSA based on polysomnography results, while 42 participants showed no evidence of the disorder and were assigned to the control group. The study received ethical approval from the Ethics Committees of the Hospital Medical Centre Bežanijska kosa (No. 3747/4) and the University of Belgrade-Faculty of Pharmacy (No. 1074/2) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Following informed consent, data were collected regarding participants’ age, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the presence of comorbid type 2 diabetes, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity and current use of antihypertensive and antihyperlipidemic therapies. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the measured height and weight data, applying the formula weight (kg) divided by height squared (m 2 2.2. Sleep Study Participants underwent overnight polysomnography from 22:00 to 06:00 h. The testing was conducted using the Alice PDx device (Philips Respironics, Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA) within a sleep laboratory setting at the Pulmonology Department of the Hospital Medical Centre Bežanijska Kosa. On the morning following the testing, each recording was analyzed by a trained specialist at 09:00 h, and data were collected on the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and average and minimal oxygen saturation (SaO 2 2.3. Laboratory Measurements Venous blood samples were obtained using standard venepuncture techniques following polysomnography studies and a 12-h fasting period. Biochemical parameters were analyzed in the collected serum samples using the Roche Cobas 6000 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd., Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The analyses included glucose, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, CRP, urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Redox status markers were measured in serum samples, except for the superoxide anion radical (O 2 .− 2 .− 16 2 .− 17 18 19 20 21 Ischaemia-modified albumin (IMA) was quantified using a colorimetric assay based on the reduced binding capacity of exogenous cobalt to the N-terminus of serum albumin [ 22 23 24 The ILAB 650 analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Milan, Italy) was employed to measure O 2 .− Following plasma separation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by the Ficoll-Paque ® TM TM 25 TM 2.4. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics v.29 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Data distribution was assessed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests. Normally distributed data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and compared using the Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. Control Group vs. Obstructive Sleep Apnea 3.1.1. Demographic, Clinical, and Biochemical Data Examination General data of the study population are given in Table 1 2 3.1.2. Oxidative Stress Biomarkers Examination Regarding the redox status markers, they did not differ between groups except for TAS being higher and sRAGE being lower in OSA patients compared to non-OSA patients ( Table 2 3.1.3. Correlation Analysis Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between biochemical and redox status biomarkers with polysomnography data ( Table 3 2 2 .− 2 3.1.4. Regression and Principal Component Analyses To determine the predictive abilities of the redox status biomarkers (AOPP, TOS, OSI, and sRAGE), in relation to the presence of OSA, we performed a binary logistic regression analysis. These markers correlated significantly with the AHI in the Spearman correlation analysis ( Table 3 PCA was applied to redox status, gene expression, and proinflammatory biomarkers to determine their relationship with OSA. The adequacy of the sample was confirmed using the Keiser–Meier–Olkin measure index equal to 0.674. Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant ( p Table 4 This PCA extracted four significant factors with a total percentage of explainable variation of 62% of the analysed biomarkers. The first factor (redox status-related factor) explained 27% of the total variance in the analyzed population. It was associated with positive loadings of the TOS, SOD, AOPP, IMA, and tSH groups and with negative loadings of TAS. The second factor (proinflammatory gene-related factor) explained 13% of the total variance in the population studied. It was associated with a positive loading of normalized TGF-β1 and RAGE mRNAs. The third factor (sRAGE-ROS-related factor) explained 11% of the total variance in the analyzed population. It was associated with positive loading of sRAGE and O 2 .– Using the scores derived from the PCA, we performed an univariate binary logistic regression analysis to determine which factor was associated with OSA status ( Table 5 p 3.2. Examination in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea 3.2.1. Demographic, Clinical, and Biochemistry Data According to the Apnea–Hypopnea Index Our further aim was to analyze clinical biomarkers and the redox status in OSA patients only. We formed three groups according to the severity of OSA. The general data of OSA patients are shown in Table 6 3.2.2. Redox Status and Inflammatory Biomarkers According to the Apnea–Hypopnea Index Redox status markers of the study groups are given in Table 7 3.2.3. Correlation Analysis in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Spearman correlation analysis showed positive correlations of AHI and ODI with BMI, glucose, uric acid, AOPP, total SH groups, IMA, TOS and OSI and negative correlations with sRAGE. In addition, only ODI correlated positively with CRP and negatively with total and direct bilirubin. Average and minimal SaO 2 2 2 Table 8 3.2.4. Regression and Principal Component Analyses in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea To determine which redox status marker is significantly associated with the OSA degree, we performed an ordinal logistic regression analysis. The significant predictors are listed in Table 9 Table 8 p Using the scores derived from the PCA, we performed a univariate ordinal logistic regression analysis to determine which factor is associated with a higher degree of OSA. Significant predictive ability was demonstrated for only one factor, the redox status-related factor (OR = 1.598, p Table 10 4. Discussion OSA is a multifactorial disorder whose onset and progression are influenced by a wide range of risk factors, including age, sex, family history, craniofacial anatomy, and other structural characteristics of the upper respiratory tract, as well as alcohol and tobacco use [ 1 2 2 1 3 6 To our knowledge, this is the first study to simultaneously examine multiple biomarkers of redox balance and inflammatory status in relation to both the presence and severity of OSA. Our findings indicate that alterations in redox and inflammatory homeostasis are evident in patients with OSA. Compared with the control group, OSA patients exhibited higher TAS and lower sRAGE levels. Furthermore, patients with more severe OSA demonstrated increased levels of AOPP, tSH groups, TOS, OSI, and TGF-β1 mRNA, alongside lower sRAGE concentrations, compared with those with milder forms of the disease. A key regulator in the cycles of oxygen deprivation and reoxygenation that precipitate oxidative stress is hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α). This transcription factor is stabilized under hypoxic conditions and accumulates in the cell, subsequently translocating to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of genes implicated in oxygen metabolism and inflammatory pathways [ 26 27 2 .− 6 27 TOS reflects the overall burden of oxidants, including ROS, within the body, and elevated values are indicative of heightened oxidative stress [ 23 24 8 28 Table 2 Table 7 29 24 Table 1 30 Table 2 Table 3 Table 7 Table 9 Table 10 As highly reactive molecules, ROS can interact with and damage critical cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids [ 6 7 20 9 31 Table 2 Table 7 TBARS levels also showed no correlation with polysomnographic parameters. Even within the PCA-derived Pro-oxidant-related factor, TBARS demonstrated no significant associations with either the presence or severity of OSA ( Table 5 Table 10 32 ROS interact with plasma proteins, leading to the formation of dityrosine cross-links and carbonyl derivatives, which subsequently give rise to AOPPs [ 17 9 33 33 34 Although AOPP levels did not differ significantly between OSA patients and controls, they were markedly higher in patients with severe OSA compared with those with mild or moderate disease ( Table 7 Table 9 Table 10 33 35 34 11 FlRAGE activates oxidative stress and inflammatory signalling pathways upon interaction with AGEs, forming a mechanistic basis for the development of OSA-related complications [ 11 12 36 36 Table 2 Table 7 Table 3 Table 8 In contrast, sRAGE, which functions as a decoy receptor by neutralizing the effects of AGEs on mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, mitigating oxidative stress, and inhibiting proinflammatory signalling cascades [ 13 37 Table 2 Table 3 Table 7 37 38 39 38 40 Table 9 2 .− Table 5 Reduced sRAGE levels may occur early in the development of hypertensive disease [ 41 42 43 41 44 Table 1 Table 1 Table 6 Table 1 Low-grade inflammation, as indicated by CRP, an established biomarker of inflammation, was observed in participants in our study ( Table 1 Table 3 Table 9 45 TGF-β1 is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates ECM synthesis and remodelling in various peripheral tissues, including the lung, which can contribute to both fibrogenic and anti-inflammatory processes [ 46 14 47 + + 48 Table 2 Table 3 Table 7 14 49 50 51 52 Our study results highlight the additional value and potential of the examined oxidative stress and inflammation markers in predicting OSA severity. This was supported by previously published data. As OSA severity increases, TOS rises while total TAS declines, reflecting OSA-related oxidative stress [ 8 53 54 8 54 55 38 56 57 41 42 43 44 47 48 51 52 Although we did not assess the effects of continuous positive airway pressure therapy on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in this study, it is likely that such therapy may influence these parameters. Published studies to date have reported conflicting results regarding the impact of continuous positive airway pressure therapy on oxidative stress, inflammation, and OSA-related comorbidities [ 30 58 59 This study has several limitations. Firstly, as a cross-sectional study, it identified significant associations between the examined biomarkers, OSA, and OSA severity but causality cannot be inferred. Prospective studies are required to determine whether progressive oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to the development or progression of OSA and its complications. Secondly, the duration of OSA prior to diagnosis in our patients is unknown, leaving it unclear whether the observed biomarker alterations are causal or consequential. Thirdly, future research should assess TGF-β1 protein levels in serum and PBMCs alongside mRNA expression to verify whether protein levels reflect the observed mRNA changes and to further elucidate immunomodulatory dysfunction in these cells. Finally, although the study included a balanced number of male and female participants, a larger cohort, not only from one institution, would strengthen the robustness of our conclusions. Despite these limitations, the present study provides a foundation for future investigations. 5. Conclusions In summary, patients with OSA exhibited a state of heightened oxidative stress and inflammation, characterized by elevated TAS and CRP levels alongside reduced sRAGE. Increasing OSA severity, as reflected by AHI, was associated with higher TOS, OSI, and TGF-β1 mRNA levels, together with lower sRAGE. Furthermore, a composite profile of redox and proinflammatory biomarkers was linked to both the presence and severity of OSA. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in OSA and may have implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.
