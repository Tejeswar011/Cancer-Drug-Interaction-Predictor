Despite over 70 years of vaccination, influenza still creates epidemics and pandemics, and the ongoing use of vaccination is an essential but currently insufficient strategy. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity and efficacy of an AP205 virus-like particle (VLP) carrying the HA head domain of the A/PR8/H1N1 strain, administered intranasally and subcutaneously in mice. For this purpose, the entire head region of A/PR8/H1N1 was genetically integrated into a sterically improved version of AP205, which exhibits capsid monomers fused into a dimer, thereby offering inexpensive and scalable production processes. The vaccine induced strong systemic anti-HA IgG and IgA antibodies via both routes, with no significant difference in the levels of IgG. Both immunisation strategies induced protection against a lethal challenge with H1PR8 mouse-adapted influenza virus. The findings demonstrate the potential of the AP205 VLP platform for HA1-based influenza vaccines and its applicability for controlling influenza in both humans and livestock. vaccine influenza virus-like particle public health Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) 10001271 This research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) to M.F.B., grant number 10001271. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Influenza is an infectious respiratory illness caused in humans by the influenza A and influenza B viruses. Most individuals affected by influenza exhibit an abrupt onset of respiratory symptoms and myalgia, sometimes accompanied by fever, and typically recover within a week. However, a significant proportion of cases progress to severe and fatal pneumonia caused by either the virus itself or secondary bacterial infections [ 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 6 The complexity, unpredictability, and multi-species involvement of influenza epidemics necessitate a One Health approach to address the issue promptly and holistically. Key priorities include enhanced surveillance in animal populations and farming environments, the real-time genomic surveillance of H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) viruses, improvements in farm biosecurity, the vaccination of animals, and wildlife conservation practices that do not compromise habitat integrity [ 7 8 Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are classified into four distinct types: A, B, C, and D. Only influenza A and B viruses infect humans. They are characterised by eight negative-sense, single-stranded RNA gene segments, encoding ten essential viral proteins and additional strain-specific proteins [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 4 12 15 Virus-like particles (VLPs) are self-assembling systems, generating virus-shaped particles, produced by the expression of one or more viral proteins [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 16 26 27 Here, we used the AP205 nanoparticle, based on the coat protein of the bacteriophage AP205 that infects Acinetobacter bacteria. Following the expression of the coat protein in Escherichia coli 28 To achieve the steric optimisation of the VLP, monomers were dimerized, producing a particle with 90 instead of 180 N- and C-termini. This reduction in termini provides more space for the fusion and proper folding of larger epitopes on the VLP surface, thereby enhancing the induction of strong antibody responses [ 20 23 28 28 29 Here, we have shown that an AP205dim fusion with the HA1 domain based on the H1N1 PR8 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1)) strain can be produced in E. coli 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Mice Animals All in vivo tests were conducted using 8- to 12-week-old wild-type (wt) female BALB/cOlaHsd mice (Envigo, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Swiss Animal Welfare Act (455.109.1-5, September 2008) and approved by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office. Experiments were performed at the University of Bern under the relevant institutional guidelines. 2.2. Development of HA1–AP205dim Vaccine The amino acid sequence of influenza A virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1)) HA1 head domain was obtained from GenBank (ID: 956529), N-terminally fused via a GSGG linker to an AP205dimer construct, and inserted into pET-28a(+) (Gene Universal Inc., Newark, NJ, USA) for bacterial expression. The plasmid was reconstituted to a final concentration of 50 µg/µL and transformed into electrocompetent XL-1 cells. After transformation, a single colony was picked and grown overnight at 37 °C, 200 rpm. For protein expression, bacteria were grown in LB medium until reaching an OD 600nm g 2 4 2 2 4 2.3. SDS-PAGE Analysis For protein analysis, 15 μL of sample was mixed with 3 μL of 5× reduction buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. 39000). The sample was heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then loaded onto an SDS-PAGE (12% with 4% stacking gel). A protein ladder (10 μL, Thermo Scientific, Cat. 26616) was included for molecular weight reference. Electrophoresis was run in a buffer containing 25 mM of tris, 25 mM of glycine, and 25 mM of 0.1% SDS. Gels were run first at 70 V, then adjusted to the sample migration. Gels were then stained with InstantBlue ® Ab119211 2.4. Western Blot For immunoblotting, 5 µg of each protein (AP205, HA1–AP205dim) was put onto a 12% SDS gel and then transferred to a 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane using the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot ® 2.5. Electron Microscopy The integrity and physical appearance of the vaccine candidate HA1–AP205dim VLP was visualised via transmission electron microscopy (Philips CM12 EM, Philips Electronics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Sample grids were glow-discharged before incubating with 10 μL of HA1–AP205dim (1.1 mg/mL) for 30 s. The grids were then rinsed three times with ddH20 and negatively stained for 30 s with 5 μL of 5% uranyl acetate. Excess uranyl acetate was removed, and the sample grids were air-dried for 10 min. Images were captured at magnifications of 84,000× and 110,000×. 2.6. Immunisation and Virus Challenge Wild-type BALB/cOlaHsd mice (8–12 weeks old) were randomly assigned to receive either the HA1–AP205dim vaccine or the AP205dim control and were not pre-assessed before allocation/vaccination. Mice ( n 2.7. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) To evaluate antibody binding to the HA domain, 96-well ELISA plates (Corning) were coated with 1 µg/mL of H1N1 HA1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA, Cat. A42599) in PBS, 50 μL/well, and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Plates were rinsed five times with PBS and blocked with PBS/0.15% Casein (Sigma Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA, C7078-500G) for 2 h at room temperature. Serum samples from immunised mice were serially diluted (1:3) in PBS/0.15% casein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed five times with PBS+Tween 0.01%. For detection, 50 μL of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) or IgA (ICN 55549) at 1:1000 was added. Prior to IgA detection, serum IgG was depleted using Protein G beads (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions, to avoid interference via IgG detection. To analyse IgG subclasses, the following HRP-conjugated antibodies were used (all at 1:2000): rat anti-mouse IgG1 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA, Cat. 559626), biotinylated mouse anti-mouse IgG2a (Clone R19-15, BD Biosciences, Cat No 553391, USA), goat anti-mouse IgG2b (Invitrogen, Ref. M32407 2.8. Avidity (ELISA) To assess antibody avidity, two parallel ELISAs were performed as described above. After 1 h of the mice serum incubation step at RT, one plate was washed with PBS/Tween 0.01% and the other with 7 M of urea and incubated for 5 min to disrupt weakly bound antibodies. Plates were washed three times and processed as above. Then, 50 μL of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) at a 1:1000 dilution was used as the detection antibody. TMB substrate and sulfuric acid were used to develop the plates as described above, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Avidity was calculated based on the OD values. 2.9. Murine Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on day 49, as previously described by Sun et al. [ 30 g 30 2.10. Neutralisation MDCK-II cells (provided by Georg Herrler, University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Germany) were seeded onto 96-well plates and grown overnight before infection. Sera samples were ten-fold serially diluted in serum-free growth media (MEM, Life Technologies, Zug, Switzerland, Cat No 11095080) and incubated with 200 pfu of virus for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture was then transferred onto the plate with the seeded cells in MEM, with 1% Trypsin (Sigma, Cat No T6763-250MG), 2% FBS (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), and 1% ( v v v v 50 31 2.11. Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) Assay Antibody competition assays were performed using an Octet RED96e system (Fortébio). Anti-Penta-HIS biosensors (HIS1K, Lot 2006292) were pre-hydrated in BLI buffer (PBS, 0.1% BSA, and 0.02% Tween 20) for 10 min. Sensors were loaded with 10 μg/mL His-tagged H1N1 HA (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1)) and loaded with mouse sera diluted 1:20. Regeneration was performed using 0.1 M of glycine (pH 1.5) followed by neutralisation with BLI buffer. Negative values were set to zero. K dis −7 −7 2.12. Statistical Analyses Analyses were conducted using one-way ANOVA as well as Student’s t p p p p p p p 3. Results 3.1. HA1–AP205dim Vaccine Production To develop a potent and scalable vaccine, we focused our design on the hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein, the principal target of neutralising antibodies. These antibodies (Abs), mainly directed against the HA head domain, block viral binding to host cells and protect against influenza infection [ 32 Figure 1 E. coli 23 24 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. HA1–AP205dim Vaccine Elicits a High Amount of Specific Antibodies Against the HA Protein in Sera To evaluate the immunogenicity of the HA1–AP205dim vaccine, BALB/c mice were immunised either subcutaneously (s.c.) or intranasally (i.n.) with 40 μg of vaccine on day 0, followed by a homologous booster on day 28 ( Figure 2 450 10 450 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 27 Figure 2 33 3.3. HA1–AP205dim Induces Local IgG and IgA Responses in the Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid To evaluate local mucosal immunity, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected from vaccinated mice on day 49. HA-specific antibody responses in BAL were assessed via ELISA. Both i.n. and the subcutaneous s.c. delivery of HA1–AP205dim resulted in the induction of HA-specific IgG in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Although IgG levels were slightly higher in mice immunised via the intranasal route, this difference did not reach statistical significance (see Figure 3 Figure 3 IgG subclass analysis revealed a balanced induction in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of intranasal (i.n.) immunised mice, whereas subcutaneous (s.c.) immunised animals showed significantly lower levels across all subclasses ( Figure 3 34 3.4. HA1–AP205dim Induces HA-Binding and Virus-Neutralising Antibodies To evaluate the binding quality and functional activity of vaccine-induced antibodies, serum samples collected on day 49 were analysed using bio-layer interferometry (BLI) and virus neutralisation tests (VNT). BLI was performed using recombinant HA protein from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) immobilised on biosensors. Sera from both intranasally (i.n.) and subcutaneously (s.c.) immunised mice showed strong binding to the HA-coated biosensor. In contrast, control sera from mice immunised with AP205dim particles devoid of HA1 exhibited no distinct binding. A monoclonal antibody specific for the HA1 domain was included as a positive control and demonstrated robust binding to the HA-coated sensors. A comparison of the binding kinetics between the two immunisation routes was conducted through the analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) of the sensorgrams (see Figure 4 To assess the stability of antigen–antibody interactions elicited by different immunisation routes, we compared the dissociation rate constants to a reference monoclonal antibody. The dissociation rate reflects the stability of the formed immune complexes, with lower s −1 Figure 4 −4 −7 The functional neutralisation of sera was evaluated using a virus neutralisation test (VNT) against the mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) virus in MDCK cells. Neutralising activity was expressed as the 50% neutralisation dose (ND 50 Figure 4 3.5. HA1–AP205dim Vaccination Protects Mice Against Lethal Influenza Challenge To assess the protective efficacy of the HA1–AP205dim vaccine in vivo, vaccinated and control mice were challenged intranasally with 2×LD50 of the mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) virus, three weeks after the final immunisation. Mice were then monitored daily over 14 days for changes in body weight, clinical signs of disease, and survival. Remarkably, almost all mice immunised with HA1–AP205dim, either intranasally (i.n.) or subcutaneously (s.c.), were largely protected against mortality, with only one vaccinated mouse succumbing to infection ( Figure 5 Figure 5 4. Discussion In this study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine displaying the HA1 domain of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) on the AP205dimer platform were evaluated. The present study demonstrates that HA1–AP205dim induces potent systemic and mucosal antibody responses, conferring protection against a lethal influenza challenge in a murine model. The subcutaneous (s.c.) and intranasal (i.n.) immunisation routes were found to be equally efficacious in eliciting specific IgG and IgA levels in sera. Intranasal vaccination has been demonstrated to elicit mucosal IgA responses in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This finding underscores the capacity of this administration modality to elicit local immunity at the site of viral entry, a capacity which has already been shown with other VLP-based vaccines [ 34 35 36 37 Further characterisation of the antibody response revealed high-avidity IgG antibodies capable of binding HA and neutralising virus in vitro. It is essential to note that both immunisation routes resulted in the production of functionally competent antibodies, as evidenced by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) and virus neutralisation tests (VNT). The dissociation rates of the two administration routes showed no significant difference. However, the intranasal vaccination resulted in lower overall binding and neutralisation titres than the subcutaneous route. These findings suggest that both routes are protective; subcutaneous immunisation may elicit a quantitatively stronger antibody response in sera, perhaps due to more efficient systemic priming and enhanced antigen presentation [ 33 38 39 The vaccine’s protective efficacy was demonstrated in vivo, with vaccinated mice experiencing minimal weight loss and high survival rates after a lethal viral challenge. These findings support the use of AP205-based VLPs as a flexible platform for scalable, cost-effective vaccine production in bacterial systems. Their repetitive antigen display and encapsulated prokaryotic RNA, acting as a natural TLR7/8 ligand, enable strong immune responses without added adjuvants [ 24 24 In this context, the AP205dim platforms offers distinct advantages: low-cost manufacturing, intrinsic adjuvanticity, balanced systemic and mucosal immunity, and the ability to incorporate the full-length HA1 domain. The latter preserves conformational epitopes that may be lost in truncated constructs, enhancing antibody breadth and quality [ 20 20 A limitation of the study is that it was tested with only one strain of the influenza virus. We are currently developing an H5 vaccine based on the AP205dim platform, along with other VLP-based influenza vaccine candidates. Furthermore, although the AP205dim platform enables bacterial production of complex vaccine antigens, further optimisation of expression, purification, and refolding processes is needed to improve yields and streamline production for large-scale applications. In addition, all experiments to date have been conducted in a mouse model, which may not fully reflect vaccine performance in humans and other relevant species such as ferrets. Further experiments are planned to expand the antigenic breadth of the platform, including the incorporation of additional targets such as the matrix 2 ectodomain (M2e), neuraminidase (NA), and conserved HA stalk domains. In summary, HA1–AP205dim is proving to be a highly promising and strategically versatile vaccine candidate. Its ability to induce robust systemic and mucosal immunity, as demonstrated in both immunogenicity and protection studies, represents a significant advancement in influenza vaccine development. The inherent modularity of the AP205dim flexible antigen exchange supports timely adaptation to novel or emerging strains. Coupled with its adjuvant-free formulation and low-cost bacterial production, this platform offers a practical and scalable solution. These advantages are particularly relevant in the context of coordinated One Health strategies, where integrated efforts across human and veterinary medicine are essential to reduce transmission risks and respond effectively to evolving influenza threats [ 8 Acknowledgments We thank Gert Zimmer, Lisa Butticaz, and Artur Summerfield for the opportunity to perform the neutralisation assays at their laboratory.
