Effective therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve PC clinical outcomes [ 1–3 4 5 KRAS 3 G12D, G12R, G12V 6 7 Current genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses have suggested that DNA replication stress is a central hallmark of genetic alterations in PC. The majority of PC cells have lost the G0 and G1 cell cycle restriction points and subsequent premature S-phase entry and replication stress mainly due to mutations of TP53 CDKN2A SMAD4 CDKN2A CDKN2B SMAD4 5 8 KRAS MYC KRAS MYC 9–11 The maintenance of genome integrity requires faithful DNA duplication during cell cycle progression [ 12 13 14 15 16 KRAS 17 KRAS KRAS In this study, we find that KRAS 18 KRAS Materials and methods Cell culture, chemicals, and antibodies Human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells HPNE and human pancreatic cancer cellJeremyM Stark lines MIAPaCa-2 (MP2), BxPC3, AsPC1, PANC1, HPAFII, CFPAC1, Capan2, and PL45 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 Analyses of STN1 expression in public databases Data were obtained from the TCGA portal and PanGen ( NCT02869802 19 Gene silencing by RNA interference Control and ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of STN1 CTC1 TEN1 KRAS STN1 STN1 Mass spectrometry immunoprecipitation Plasmids pLPC-Myc and pLPC-Myc-STN1 were provided by Dr. Titia de Lange (Rockefeller University). Approximately five million cells were seeded in 100 mm dishes ( n Immunoblotting Cells cultured in plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitors (cOmplete; Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP; Roche) for 15 min on ice. Then, cell lysates were centrifuged at 133 000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein quantification was determined with DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:500-2,000 ( Supplementary Table S1 Real-time quantitative RT-PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and 1 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using SYBR-Green chemistry (Bio-Rad). The gene expression levels were normalized to housekeeping gene GAPDH STN1 OBFC1 GAPDH CTC1 TEN1 Cell cycle distribution analysis After STN1 Radiation clonogenic assay Radiation clonogenic assay was performed as described before [ 20 Immunofluorescence for nuclear foci and mitotic catastrophe Nuclear foci and mitotic catastrophe were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining as previously described [ 17 HR and NHEJ reporter assays MIAPaCa-2 cells stably expressing fluorescent NHEJ (NHEJ-GFP) and HR (DR-GFP) reporter assays were used as described previously [ 20 21 Chromatin spreading assay Cells were treated with control or STN1 siRNA for 48 h. Then, the cells were treated with 4 Gy IR followed by recovery for 24 h. After the addition of 0.02 μg/ml Colcemid (Gibco) and incubation at 37°C for 5 h, all media and PBS used for rinsing cells were collected and spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 min in order not to lose dislodged mitotic cells. The supernatant was discarded, leaving behind cell pellet in 100 μl of liquid. The cells on the plate were harvested by trypsinization and combined with the above collected mitotic cells in a total volume of 300 μl, followed by the addition of 1 ml of 37°C hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl). After incubation at 37° for 15 min, two drops of fixative (3:1 methanol:acetic acid) were added and the cells were collected by centrifugation (800 rpm, 5 min) leaving ∼100 μl of liquid. After gentle resuspension, the cells were added with 1 ml of fixative drop by drop with agitation and incubated on ice for 60 min followed by collection at 500 rpm for 5 min. After repeating these fixation steps for two times, 20 μl of the fixed swollen cells were dropped onto glass microscope slides and immediately run through the flame of a burner (bottom side of slide toward the flame), followed by incubation at 56°C for 1 h. After air-drying, several drops of ProLong mounting medium containing DAPI (Life Technologies) were added onto the slide surface. After the addition of a coverslip and drying for at least 1 h, the stained slides were observed under a fluorescent microscope and chromosomes were counted from the images.  In vivo All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) policies and procedures in the City of Hope (Duarte, CA). Six- to eight-week-old athymic nude mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories were injected with AsPC-1 cells (1 × 10 6 Statistical analyses Graphs were constructed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

STN1 silencing impairs cell cycle regulation and enhances radiation-induced cell death A critical function of ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint induction is to halt cell cycle progression, providing time for cells to repair DNA damage [ 36 17 5A Supplementary Fig. S7A 5B Supplementary Fig. S7B 37 38 5C 5E Figure 5.

( A B C D E F ∗∗ P ∗∗∗ P G Discussion In this study, we found that STN1 KRAS In our studies, we found that KRAS signaling positively regulates STN1 expression (Fig. 1E 1G 39–41 KRAS BRAF TP53 37 42 MYC CCNE 10 11 42 TP53 CDKN2A CDKN2B KRAS MYC 8 43 44 45 Our current results indicate that KRAS-induced upregulation of STN1 is required for PC cells to survive radiation by sustaining ATM-mediated replication stress response. We found that silencing STN1 leads to the decreased accumulation of cells in G2/M phase in response to IR. Moreover, silencing STN1 results in reduction of total ATM, phosphorylated ATM, and CHK2, which was accompanied with reduced levels of Cyclin B1, a cyclin that is upregulated during transition to G2/M [ 46 5G 32 47–49 Related to DSBs, NHEJ serves as the major machinery for the repair of DSBs throughout all phases of the cell cycle. Previous studies have demonstrated that CST-polα-primase promotes NHEJ via 53BP1-shieldin [ 50 51 Similar to its role in NHEJ, we found that STN1 also promotes HR repair of DSBs independent of CST. Interestingly, mutations of CTC1 or STN1 lead to coats plus (CP) syndrome and dyskeratosis congenita [ 52–54 30 55 56 50 51 PC cells rely on S and G2/M checkpoints for survival. Molecularly targeting S and G2/M checkpoints sensitizes cancer cells to radiotherapy via inducing mitotic catastrophe as well as exacerbating radiation-induced replication stress [ 8 37 42 57 58 KRAS KRAS STN1 KRAS RAS In summary, we demonstrated that KRAS 18 27 KRAS Supplementary Material gkaf983_Supplemental_Files Acknowledgements The results published here are in part based upon data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas managed by the NCI and NHGRI ( http://cancergenome.nih.gov  Author contributions Supplementary data  Supplementary data Conflict of interest None declared.
