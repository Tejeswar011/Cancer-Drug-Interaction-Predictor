Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren's syndrome (SS) are two common systemic autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have suggested that the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) may be lower in patients with SLE compared to the general population; however, the existing evidence remains limited and controversial. A systematic analysis of HBV infection rates and serological marker distributions in patients with SLE and SS may offer important insights into the interaction between autoimmune and antiviral immunity. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 2421 hospitalized patients with SLE and 2049 with SS at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from January 2019 to December 2024. Patients with other autoimmune diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD)) and 5927 non-autoimmune hospitalized patients were included as controls. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) serological markers (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, and HBcAb) and anti-HCV antibodies were tested. We compared the positivity rates of HBV seromarkers across different groups and performed subgroup analyses based on sex, age, and autoantibody profiles. Results The HBsAg positivity rate was significantly lower in SLE and SS patients compared with non-autoimmune controls (1.2 % vs. 5.2 %, P < 0.0001; 1.7 % vs. 5.2 %, P < 0.0001, respectively). No significant differences were observed in patients with RA, AS, UC, or CD. Stratified analyses revealed consistently lower HBsAg positivity in SLE and SS patients across both sexes and all age groups above 20 years. Further analyses indicated that this phenomenon was not attributable to occult HBV infection, inpatient versus outpatient status, or immunosuppressant use. Notably, high ANA titers and the presence of antibodies such as anti-dsDNA, anti-SSA, and anti-ribosomal P were associated with lower HBsAg positivity. No significant differences in HBsAg positivity were found between patients with or without common complications. Conclusion SLE and SS patients exhibit consistently lower HBsAg positivity rates, independent of clinical factors, and linked to autoantibody status. These findings suggest disease-specific immune mechanisms that may promote HBV clearance or reduce susceptibility to infection. Highlights • HBsAg positivity is significantly reduced in SLE and SS patients. • HBsAg reduction persists across age, sex, and autoantibody-positive subgroups. • Findings suggest enhanced HBV clearance in autoimmunity, offering new therapeutic insights.

Among them, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren's syndrome (SS) are two representative systemic autoimmune diseases [ 1 2 3 4 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health issue. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 254 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV [ 5 6 [7] [8] [9] 10 11 12 Although some studies have examined the prevalence of HBV infection in autoimmune diseases, several limitations remain [ [7] [8] [9] [10] 13 7 8 This study retrospectively analyzes clinical data from a large cohort of patients with autoimmune diseases to systematically compare HBsAg positivity rates among patients with SLE, SS, the general population, and other autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis). It also comprehensively evaluates the distribution of HBV serological markers and explores the correlation between different autoantibodies, complications, and HBV infection rates. This study is expected to provide evidence-based support for optimizing HBV screening strategies and guiding immunosuppressive therapy in autoimmune disease patients, while offering new insights into the interplay between autoimmunity and antiviral immunity. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Patients and controls A total of 2421 patients with SLE, 2049 with SS, 2382 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 3739 with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 380 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 1440 with Crohn's disease (CD) who were hospitalized at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2024 were included in this study. In addition, 5927 hospitalized patients without autoimmune diseases during the same period served as the control group. Detailed baseline characteristics of all patients and controls are summarized in Table 1 Table 1 Baseline characteristics of patients and control group. Table 1 Group Total (n) Male (n, %) Female (n, %) Mean age ± SD (years) SLE 2421 223 (9.2 %) 2198 (90.8 %) 39.6 ± 14.7 SS 2049 144 (7.0 %) 1905 (93.0 %) 52.5 ± 14.2 RA 2382 479 (20.1 %) 1903 (79.9 %) 55.7 ± 13.7 AS 3739 2913 (77.9 %) 826 (22.1 %) 36.4 ± 11.9 UC 380 195 (51.3 %) 185 (48.7 %) 45.8 ± 15.6 CD 1440 1020 (70.8 %) 420 (29.2 %) 33.1 ± 12.9 Control 5927 3099 (52.3 %) 2828 (47.7 %) 47.8 ± 19.9 2.2 Detection methods All participants were tested for HBV and HCV-related serological markers upon hospital admission. The HBV “two pairs and a half” panel (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, and HBcAb) and anti-HCV were measured using CLIA. The assays were performed on the HISCL-5000 fully automated analyzer (Sysmex Corporation), with reagents provided by the same manufacturer. The cut-off value for HBsAg positivity was set at ≥0.05 IU/mL. For SLE and SS patients, ANA were detected using IFA (EUROIMMUN). Other autoantibodies, including anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, and anti-RNP, were tested using the EUROIMMUN immunoblotting method. All procedures followed the manufacturer's standard instructions, and fluorescence images were interpreted by certified laboratory technicians. 2.3 Data collection and cleaning process This study utilized the electronic medical record system and laboratory diagnostic database of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital to collect clinical data of hospitalized patients between January 2019 and December 2024. For patients with SLE and SS, clinical information and comorbidity data were obtained from discharge diagnoses to ensure accuracy and reliability. Patients with RA, AS, UC, CD, as well as non-autoimmune hospitalized patients during the same period, were included as controls, with basic demographic information and virological test results collected. During data cleaning, cases with missing or incorrect diagnostic information were excluded, patients with incomplete HBV/HCV serological test results were removed, and for those with multiple hospitalizations, only the first admission record was retained to ensure data completeness and consistency. 2.4 Statistical analysis All data were analyzed using SPSS version 26 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages, and differences between groups were assessed using the chi-square (χ 2 3 Results 3.1 Distribution of HBV serological markers among different populations We compared the positivity rates of five HBV-related serological markers (HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAb, HBeAg, and HBcAb) among patients with six representative autoimmune diseases (SLE, SS, RA, AS, IBD, and CD) and individuals from a healthy control population. HBsAg, as the core indicator of chronic HBV infection, was significantly lower in the SLE (1.2 %) and SS (1.7 %) groups compared to the non-autoimmune disease group (5.2 %, P < 0.0001), with statistical significance. In contrast, the HBsAg positivity rates in RA, CD, AS, and UC patients did not differ significantly from those in the control group ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Distinct HBV and HCV serological marker profiles in autoimmune diseases.

Fig. 1 3.2 Distribution of HBsAg positivity by sex and age stratification in SLE and SS patients To further investigate the population characteristics underlying the decreased HBsAg positivity rates in SLE and SS patients, we performed stratified analyses based on sex and age, comparing the results with those of the healthy control group ( Table 2 Table 2 Comparative analysis of HBsAg positivity in SLE and SS patients versus healthy controls across gender and age groups.

We evaluated the proportion of “occult HBV infection” (defined as HBsAg-negative but HBV DNA-positive). The results showed that the proportion of occult infection in both SLE and SS patients was approximately 1 %, with no significant difference compared with the control group ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Impact of HBV DNA load, patient source, and immunosuppressant use on HBsAg positivity in SLE and SS patients.

Fig. 2 3.4 Comparison of HBsAg positivity among different autoantibody subgroups in SLE and SS patients To explore whether the reduced rate of chronic HBV infection is associated with specific autoantibody profiles, we compared HBsAg positivity between autoantibody-positive and -negative subgroups among SLE and SS patients ( Table 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Table 3 The comparison of the positive rate of HBsAg among different autoantibody groups in patients with SLE and SS.

Fig. 3 3.5 Analysis of the impact of different complications on HBsAg positivity in SLE and SS patients Building on the confirmed overall decline in HBsAg positivity among patients with SLE and SS, this study further investigated whether disease-related complications influence HBV infection rates. In SLE patients, we conducted a comparative analysis of HBsAg positivity across common complications, including lupus nephritis, neuropsychiatric lupus, anemia, and hyperlipidemia. For SS patients, interstitial pneumonia and anemia-the two major complications-were included in the evaluation. The results showed no significant differences in HBsAg positivity between patients with or without these complications in either SLE or SS groups, suggesting that changes in HBV infection status are not markedly affected by the presence of complications ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Comparison of HBsAg positivity rates in SLE and SS patients with or without specific complications. (A–D) Comparison of HBsAg positivity between SLE patients with and without lupus nephritis (LN) (n = 1080/1341), neuropsychiatric lupus (NP) (n = 89/2332), anemia (n = 1080/1341), and hyperlipidemia (HLP) (n = 308/2113). (E–F) Comparison of HBsAg positivity between SS patients with and without interstitial lung disease (ILD) (n = 285/1764) and anemia (n = 284/1765). Fig. 4 4 Discussion This study focused on the distribution characteristics of HBV infection in patients with SLE and SS, particularly the changes in HBsAg positivity rate, using HCV infection as a control. The aim was to explore the potential interactions and mechanisms between viral infection and autoimmune diseases. Based on large-scale data, we found that the HBsAg positivity rate in SLE patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls and patients with other autoimmune diseases, whereas HCV infection showed no significant differences across groups. This result is consistent with previous clinical observations and provides further support for the interaction between HBV and autoimmune diseases. In clinical practice, HBV infection status is typically assessed using five serological markers. Among them, HBsAg is the most direct and important indicator of current HBV infection, with positivity representing chronic infection or a carrier state, while HBsAb positivity generally indicates past exposure with viral clearance or immunity acquired through vaccination [ 14 To eliminate potential confounding due to demographic structure, we conducted stratified analyses by sex and age. The results showed that the trend of lower HBsAg positivity remained significant across both sexes, suggesting that the observed low infection rate was not driven by sex differences. Our overall findings indicated that HBsAg positivity was consistently lower in SLE and SS patients than in controls across most age groups, with the difference being particularly pronounced in individuals over 30 years old. No significant differences were observed in individuals under 20 years of age, likely due to the very low HBV infection rate in this age group and the limited number of HBsAg-positive cases, resulting in non-significant differences. This phenomenon is closely related to the implementation of the universal HBV vaccination program for newborns in China since 1992, which has greatly reduced HBV infection rates in those under 20 years of age [ 15 The pathogenesis of SLE is closely associated with hyperactivation of the humoral immune system and the widespread production of autoantibodies [ 16 17 In this study, to minimize the influence of potential selection bias and confounding factors, we analyzed the relationships between HBV DNA load, patient source, and immunosuppressant use with HBsAg positivity in SLE and SS patients. The evaluation of occult HBV infection demonstrated that its prevalence did not differ significantly between patients and healthy controls. This finding suggests that occult HBV infection is not common in this population, consistent with previous reports of its low frequency [ 18 In addition to immunological cross-reactivity, other mechanisms may also contribute to the reduced HBV infection rate observed in SLE and SS patients. Elevated levels of IFN-α and IL-6 in SLE may play dual roles in modulating HBV infection [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Despite the retrospective nature of this study, it offers several strengths. Compared with previous studies that involved small sample sizes or a single disease type, our study included a wide range of representative autoimmune diseases and identified a significantly reduced HBsAg positivity rate specifically in SLE and SS patients. This phenomenon remained statistically significant across different sex and age subgroups. Additionally, we systematically assessed the impact of different autoantibody profiles on HBsAg positivity, highlighting that ANA and several specific autoantibodies may be associated with reduced HBV infection rates. Furthermore, we found that major complications did not significantly influence HBV infection status, which further supports the role of the immune background in modulating HBV susceptibility. These findings provide new insights into the interaction between autoimmune diseases and viral infections and may offer novel perspectives for developing therapeutic strategies for both HBV and SLE. 5 Conclusion This study found that the HBsAg positivity rate in SLE and SS patients was significantly lower than that in controls and other autoimmune diseases, and this trend was consistent across different sexes and age groups. This phenomenon was not related to occult HBV infection, the use of immunosuppressants, or complications. Further analysis showed that high ANA titers and multiple autoantibodies were associated with decreased HBsAg positivity. These findings suggest that the reduced HBV infection rate in SLE and SS is mainly attributable to disease-specific immunological mechanisms, highlighting the need for further mechanistic and longitudinal investigations.
