Recent evidence suggests that other circulating biological nanoparticles, primarily lipoproteins, bind to EVs, changing their biological identity. Such binding has been demonstrated with complex qualitative techniques, such as cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. There is a need to rapidly and simply quantify EV‐lipoprotein binding, as such complexes could have major implications for EV biology and medical applications. This study developed lipoprotein association fluorometry (LAF; based on fluorescent lipophilic indocarbocyanine dyes), as a first‐of‐its‐kind, simple and quick assay to assess EV binding to lipoproteins. The LAF assay was validated with synthetic nanoparticles, small molecules, polymers and proteins that display known interactions with lipoproteins. The LAF assay demonstrates that EVs from various human and non‐human (nematode and bacteria) sources bind to very‐low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL). Notably, EVs derived from cancerous cells displayed substantially increased binding to VLDL, LDL and plasma compared to EVs from normal cells. Additionally, the LAF assay revealed that EVs from metastatic cancer cells bound to VLDL to a greater extent than those from corresponding patient‐matched non‐metastatic cancer cells. On the contrary, EVs displayed minimal binding to high‐density lipoprotein (HDL). Taken together, the LAF assay is capable of measuring EV‐lipoprotein binding in a simple, rapid and semi‐quantitative manner, leading to new opportunities to probe EV biology and develop novel therapeutics, and diagnostics. bad cholesterol corona exosomes LDL microvesicles VLDL pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025  Ghebosu R.

EVs from human, plant, nematode and bacteria sources were assessed. The LAF assay was also validated with synthetic nanoparticles, polymers, proteins, peptides and small molecules with known interactions with lipoproteins, demonstrating broad applicability. Overall, the LAF assay overcomes labour intensive and time‐consuming qualitative methods that rely on specialized equipment, such as cryo‐TEM, providing a new semi‐quantitative characterization tool to rapidly assess lipoprotein interactions that are likely to change the biological identity of EVs. 2 Methods 2.1 Lipoprotein, Protein, Small Molecule and Polymer Preparation Human VLDL (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, 437647) was diluted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4, Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10010‐031), stored at 4°C, and used within 1.5 months of opening. Human LDL (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, SAE0053) and HDL (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, L1567) were stored at −80°C for up to 2 months and 4°C for up to 2 weeks, respectively, prior to preparation for the assay. Lipoproteins were isolated from human plasma using proprietary methods and the manufacturer reported that the purity of VLDL and HDL were greater than 95% (assessed by electrophoresis), aligning with standards for analytical materials (Portoghese 1999 2009 2.2 Synthetic Nanoparticle Preparation Pegylated lipid nanoparticles were acquired from The University of Queensland BASE mRNA facility (service provider). The Pegylated lipid nanoparticles were manufactured by microfluidic mixing with the NanoAssemblr Ignite+ by Precision NanoSystems. Pegylated lipid nanoparticles were comprised of SM‐102 (Sapphire Biosciences, 33474), cholesterol (Sapphire Biosciences, 700100P‐100MG‐A‐036), 1,2‐dimyristoyl‐rac‐glycero‐3‐methoxypolyethylene glycol‐2000 (DMG‐PEG 2000, Sapphire Biosciences, 33945) and dimyristoyl glycerol, and 1,2‐distearoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphocholine (DSPC, Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, P1138) at a molar ratio of 50:38.5:1.5:1. Liposomes were prepared using the thin‐film hydration method and extrusion, as previously described (Wolfram et al. 2016 sn 2.3 Human Cell Culture and Production of Conditioned Cell Culture Media MDA‐MB‐231 TGL (Minn et al. 2005 2009 2005 2003 2, HE000725 HE000027 Prior to EV isolation, cells were grown to 90% confluency in 175 cm 2 2022 g HE000652 g 2.4 Tangential Flow Filtration and Diafiltration for Isolation of Human EVs EVs were isolated from conditioned cell culture media by tangential flow filtration and diafiltration using a KrosFlo KR2i TFF System (Repligen) under sterile conditions (Busatto et al. 2020 2020 2021 2021 2018 2 2018 2 2022 2.5 Spirulina Cultures Xenic spirulina microalgae stock ( Limnospira maxima 2001 To isolate pure spirulina EVs as previously described (Sharifpour et al. 2024 g For EV isolation, 2.25 L of the axenic spirulina culture at an optical density of 1.3 at 680 nm was subjected to sequential low‐velocity centrifugation steps (1000 × g g g g g 2.6 Hookworm Cultures  Nippostrongylus brasiliensis 2008 Rattus norvegicus 2 g g g For EV isolation the media was concentrated using Vivaspin 20 filters with a 100 kDa cut‐off. The concentrated media then underwent high‐velocity ultracentrifugation at 170,000 × g 2.7 Orange Sample Preparation Oranges (2 kg; Citrus sinensis g g g g 2016 2.8 Size‐Exclusion Chromatography for Isolation of Non‐Human EVs EVs from spirulina, orange and hookworm were isolated by size‐exclusion chromatography. EV pellets were fractionated by size‐exclusion chromatography using a qEVoriginal isolation column (Gen 2, 35 nm) mounted on an automatic fraction collector (AFC; Izon), as per manufacturer's instructions. Fractions 2, 3 and 4 (out of 8) were collected as the purified EV sample. 2.9 Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis Nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed using a NanoSight NS300 (Software NTA 3.4 Build 3.4.4; Malvern Panalytical Ltd, Malvern) equipped with a 405 nm laser. Samples were diluted in ultrapure water (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, W4502). EVs were diluted between 1:10 and 1:50 in water based on sample concentration to ensure particles per frame were between 40 and 100, as per manufacturer guidelines. Particle concentration and size distribution were analyzed from three 1‐min videos recorded using a detection threshold of five, camera level of 10, and a continuous syringe pump flow rate of 40 µL/min. EVs used in the LDL, HDL and plasma studies were measured using a NanoSight Pro (Malvern Panalytical Ltd, Malvern), equipped with a 642 nm laser and diluted 1:50 in water. Automatic camera, focus and number of frame settings, and a flow rate of 1.5 µL/min was used. Due to differences in the detection sensitivity between the two pieces of equipment, a correction factor of 0.5 was applied to all EV concentrations measured by the NanoSight Pro. 2.10 Dynamic Light Scattering and Laser Doppler Micro‐Electrophoresis Dynamic light scattering (particle size and concentration) and laser Doppler micro‐electrophoresis (zeta‐potential) were performed using a Zetasizer Ultra (Malvern, UK). Size distribution and concentration of liposomes and lipid nanoparticles were measured at 25°C by backscatter using 10 mm square polystyrene cuvettes (Sarstedt, 67.745). Refractive index of 1.45, medium viscosity of 0.8872 mPa.s, medium refractive index of 1.335 and medium dielectric constant of 78.5 were used. Zeta potential was measured at 25°C in disposable folded capillary cells (Malvern, DTS1070) using the in‐built Smoluchowsky model. Constant voltage was manually set at 50 mV and a maximum of 30 runs were performed per each analysis. Data were analyzed using Zetasizer Advance—ZS Xplorer v3.00 software (Malvern, UK). Samples were diluted 1:100–1:1000 (v/v) in isosmotic 5 mM NaCl, PBS solution at pH 7.4 to avoid multiple scattering phenomena. 2.11 Cryo‐TEM Cryo‐TEM was used to identify phospholipid bilayers, a key authentication feature of EVs. EV samples were prepared for imaging using a Leica EM GP2 robotic vitrification system (Leica, Germany), under controlled temperature (22°C) and humidity (95%). Samples (3 µL) were dispersed onto a Lacey formvar carbon—Cu, 200 mesh grid (Electron Microscopy Services). Excess solution was mechanically blotted away for 2.5–3.5 s. Subsequently, samples were mechanically plunged into −182.8°C liquid ethane, to vitrify the sample. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen prior to imaging using a Jeol Cryo ARM 300 (JEM‐Z300FSC) TEM equipped with a cold field emission gun and an Omega energy filter. Images were captured at a 300 kV acceleration voltage and 20 eV filter setting, with zero energy loss. Images were acquired under low‐dose conditions by a Gatan K3 direct detector camera and processed using the SerialEM software (Mastronarde 2005 2 2022 2.12 Western Blot Sample protein concentration was determined by a Peirce micro bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermofisher, 23235) to allow for standardization of protein concentration. Samples were diluted in sucrose buffer and prepared in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (BioRad, 1610747) prior to heating for 5 min at 90°C. Samples (1.22 µg/well) or Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope Prestained Protein Standard (BioRad, 1610375) were loaded into NuPAGE 4%–12%, Bis‐Tris, 1.5 mm protein gels (Invitrogen, NP0321) and submerged in 1× NuPAGE running buffer (Invitrogen, NP0001) with NuPAGE antioxidants (Thermofisher, NP0005). Electrophoretic separation was performed at 120 V for 2–2.5 h using a XCell SureLock mini‐cell (Invitrogen, EI0001) and PowerPac basic power supply (BioRad, USA). Gels were removed and transferred using an XCell II blot module (Invitrogen, EI9051) with 1× NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen, NP00061) and NuPAGE antioxidants (Thermofisher, NP0005) at 200 mA for 1.5 h. A total of 10% methanol (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, 106018) was added for one gel and 20% for two gels. Protein bands and successful transfer were assessed by Ponceau staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A40000279). Ponceau was washed using 1× Tris‐buffered saline and 0.1% Tween (TBST) (Thermofisher, 28360). Membranes were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk (w/v) on an orbital shaker. Membranes were incubated on a shaker overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies and dilutions in 1% w/v milk TBST: Alix (1:200, Cell Signaling, 2171S), calnexin (1:250, GeneTex, GTX112886), CD63 (1:250, Abcam, ab134045), CD81 (1:500, Santa Cruz, sc‐166029) or CD9 (1:250, Cell Signaling, 13174S). Following incubation, membranes were washed four times for 5 min with 1× TBST. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐conjugated secondary antibodies anti‐rabbit IgG (New England Biolabs, 7074P2) and anti‐mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31430) were added at a 1:3000 dilution in 1% w/v milk TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were removed by washing three times for 5 min with 1× TBST. Membranes were incubated with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34075) and imaged using a ChemiDoc MP Imager (Bio‐Rad). 2.13 Labelling of VLDL With an Apolipoprotein B (apoB) Antibody VLDL stock solution of 2.68 mg/mL (protein concentration) was diluted 1:200 in 2 mL and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. VLDL aggregates were then incubated with 1 µg/mL of apoB antibody (1:500, Proteintech, 20578‐1‐AP) overnight at 4°C. Excess apoB was removed by a 4h dialysis with stirring at room temperature and a 300 kDa dialysis membrane (Repligen, 131450), secured on both ends with dialysis clamps. The surrounding dialysis solution consisted of a 150 mM NaCl (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, S9888) and 0.01% EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R1021) that was sterile filtered through a 0.22 µm vacuum filter (Corning, 431118). This solution was selected due to it being the original storage solution of VLDL. The dialyzed solution was then further incubated overnight at 4°C with a donkey anti‐Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A‐21206). The sample was then dialyzed again in fresh NaCl/EDTA buffer to remove unbound secondary antibody. A total of 50 µL of the labelled VLDL solution was then incubated with 5 µM of the fluorescent lipophilic indocarbocyanine dye, DiD (Thermo Fisher Scientific, V22887, excitation 648 nm and emission 670 nm), for 1 h at 37°C to stain for hydrophobic lipid cores. The fully labelled mixture (3 µL) was loaded onto a glass slide (Westlab, 663‐248) and covered with a clear glass coverslip (Westlab, 663‐251). The fluorescence was then visualized using an ECLIPSE Ti2‐U Microscope (Nikon, Japan) equipped with a FITC (apoB) and Cy5 filter (DiD) and exposure setting of 1 s for 10× magnification and 300 ms for 20× magnification. A blank PBS solution without VLDL was labelled and imaged in parallel to confirm the successful removal of primary and secondary antibodies. 2.14 Preparation of LDL and HDL Samples LDL and HDL samples were dialyzed using a 3.5 kDa dialysis tube (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, PURD35050) for 4 h at room temperature with stirring. To maintain sterile conditions during dialysis, a 150 mM NaCl (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, S9888) and 0.01% EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R1021) solution was sterile filtered through a 0.22 µm vacuum sterile filter (Corning, 431118) and used as the surrounding dialysis solution. The protein concentration of the dialyzed samples was measured by Peirce micro‐BCA protein assay kit (Thermofisher, 23235) and samples were stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks. 2.15 Lipoprotein Association Fluorometry Assay The semi‐quantitative LAF assay was performed in a 96‐well microplate format with a final volume of 50 µL in each well. Transparent 96‐well plates (Corning, 3598) were used for light microscopy images, and Nunc MicroWell 96‐Well Optical‐Bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 165305) were used for fluorescence readings. All solutions were warmed to room temperature prior to use in the LAF assay. Reagents were added to each well in the following order: PBS, lipoproteins, test sample and DiI. For standard curve generation, various dilutions of the stock protein concentration of 1.83 mg/mL VLDL solution were prepared (1:10, 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500, 1:1000 and 1:2000) in PBS in the wells. Various dilutions were also prepared for the 7.54 mg/mL (protein concentration) LDL and 3.69 mg/mL (protein concentration) HDL samples. The concentration of NaCl and EDTA buffer was not maintained for VLDL samples but was maintained for HDL and LDL samples. The VLDL standard curve values were confirmed to be unaffected by alterations in the salt concentration (data not shown). For fluorescence measurements, 5 µM of DiI was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 1 h at either 37°C or room temperature. Fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Infinite 200 plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). A fluorescence intensity scan with an excitation wavelength of 528 nm was performed at 37°C to identify the ideal emission wavelength. Excitation and emission wavelengths of 528 and 576 nm, respectively, were identified as ideal with nine reads per well (3×3 format). Optimal fluorescent gain settings were used at 37°C, and this same gain setting was then used to assess the corresponding room temperature plate. Any non‐normalized pooled data that was performed on separate instances and/or being directly compared, maintained the same gain and wavelength settings. The fluorescence intensity of a well containing only DiI in the absence of lipoproteins was subtracted from each experimental group as background fluorescence. To minimize reagent use, while still identifying differences within a broad dynamic range in response to test agents with known interactions (e.g. warfarin), protein concentrations of 37 µg/mL of VLDL and 151 µg/mL of LDL were used at a temperature of 37°C. In the case of HDL, a protein concentration of 37 µg/mL at room temperature was determined as optimal. Reagents were added to each well in the following order: PBS, lipoproteins, test sample, DiI. For warfarin, tissue plasminogen activator, cytochalasin D and LPS studies, drugs were diluted to 1 mg/mL concentrations and 5 µL of each drug was added to the assay (5 µg/well). A total of 5 µL of the respective diluent (water, DMSO or PBS) was added to DiI and lipoproteins as control wells. The same setup was performed for the warfarin standard curve studies, where 2.5 or 5 µL of various warfarin concentrations were added. All wells were adjusted to the same final volume (50 µL) and all data normalized to the appropriate controls, with corresponding volumes of diluent (water, DMSO or PBS) added. For EVs or nanoparticle studies, all samples were diluted to a concentration of 1 × 10 10 7 10 7 N. brasiliensis 10 7 2012 1976 1995 Human plasma was obtained from healthy donors, and depleted of fibrin to prevent potential clotting. Fibrin depletion was achieved by exposing plasma to 5 IU/mL of bovine thrombin (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, T4648), diluted in 0.1% BSA (Sigma‐Aldrich/Merck, A8412). Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with thrombin to allow for clot formation, then centrifuged at 10,000 × g 2.16 Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 9.4.1 software (Dotmatics). Statistical analyses were determined using one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's multiple comparison test. Statistical analysis for donor plasma samples was determined using two‐way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test (between donors) or Dunnett's multiple comparison test (compared to 100% control). Significance is displayed in the respective figure legends. 3 Results 3.1 Concentration‐ and Temperature‐Dependent Changes in VLDL Can Be Fluorometrically Quantified Recent evidence suggests that lipoprotein binding affects the biological identity of EVs including cell signalling and transport (Ghebosu et al. 2024 2022 1A 1B,C 1D 2007 1E 1F FIGURE 1 Temperature and concentration‐dependent aggregation of very low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL) can be quantified fluorescently.

Results were validated in at least three separate experiments. Differences in the fluorescence intensity between figures are due to differences in machine settings that are optimized for each experiment. Gain settings are maintained where appropriate to allow for direct comparisons between free DiI and VLDL with DiI.

The fluorescence intensity of the free DiI signal was subtracted from the data that were then normalized to the control group (VLDL/DiI alone, 100%). Results were validated in at least three separate experiments. Statistical analysis performed by ordinary one‐way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test. **** p #### p 3.3 LAF Assay Validation With Synthetic Nanoparticles and Polymers To further validate the effectiveness of the LAF assay, we assessed its compatibility with synthetic nanoparticles and polymers that are known to interact with lipoproteins, Currently, complex methods, such as gradient ultracentrifugation, mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance, are required to assess nanoparticle interactions with lipoproteins, and this is generally only applicable for apolipoproteins (protein components of lipoproteins), not intact lipoproteins (Sebastiani et al. 2022 2007 2009 2F,G 2014 2021 1986 1986 2F,G 2016 1976 1G,H 2016 2H 2024 2H 3.4 LAF Quantifies EV and VLDL Binding A major advantage of the developed LAF assay is that output measurements are based on changes to VLDL rather than measuring the bound/unbound agent of interest, enabling rapid and simple assessment with broad applicability. Following LAF assay validation with various molecules, macromolecules and synthetic nanoparticles, EVs from different sources were assessed. Identifying EV‐lipoprotein interactions could have major implications for understanding EV biology, as previous studies have shown that EVs bind to intact lipoproteins in healthy (Busatto et al. 2022 2023 2023 2020 The LAF assay was assessed with EVs isolated from various sources, including from human (HEK293T embryonic kidney cells and adipose‐derived mesenchymal stromal cells), plant (orange, C. sinensis N. brasiliensis L. maxima 2018 2024 3A–C 3D 3E S1A 3F 2016 2010 2023 2020 2022 2023 2022 FIGURE 3 LAF quantifies VLDL binding to extracellular vesicles (EVs) from various origins and disease states.

Next, another cancer type (osteosarcoma) was assessed by comparing EVs from non‐metastatic and highly metastatic cancer cells. Notably, in this case, the cells were derived from the same subtype and patient, minimizing genetic variability unrelated to metastatic transformation. Specifically, the non‐metastatic HOS osteosarcoma cell line originates from the same patient as the 143B cell line, which was transformed with an oncogene from Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (v Kras 2005 1975 1977 1971 2018 2024 5A–E 5F 4G–I 5F FIGURE 5 LAF quantifies VLDL binding to EVs from non‐ and highly metastatic patient‐matched osteosarcoma cells.

The fluorescence intensity of the free DiI signal was subtracted from the data that was then normalized to the control group (VLDL/DiI alone, 100%). Results were validated in at least three separate experiments. Statistical analysis performed by ordinary one‐way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test. **** p #### p The patient‐matched origin and substantial difference in VLDL binding between HOS and 143B osteosarcoma cells prompted further studies on these EVs. The zeta potentials of the osteosarcoma EVs were compared to assess whether differences in the surface charge of the two EV groups could impact VLDL binding. The results revealed that the zeta potentials of EVs from HOS cells (non‐metastatic) and 143B cells (highly metastatic) were almost identical: −35 mV (HOS) and −38 mV (143B) (Figure 5G 5H,I 5J,K S1B 3.7 The LAF Assay Is Broadly Applicable to LDL, HDL and Human Biofluid Samples The LAF assay was further expanded to two additional types of lipoproteins: LDL and HDL. Various protein concentrations of LDL were evaluated at 37°C and room temperature (Figure 6A 6A 1B 6A 2012 1976 1995 6B 6B 4G–I 5F 6B FIGURE 6 LAF quantifies binding to low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) and lipoproteins in human plasma.

Results were validated in at least three separate experiments. (A, C, E) Fluorescent gain settings were maintained across all readings for non‐normalized data.

Human plasma contains various lipoproteins at physiologically relevant concentrations, making it an ideal model to assess the physiological relevance of EV‐lipoprotein binding. Plasma levels above 5% (v/v) displayed markedly higher fluorescence at 37°C than at room temperature (Figure 6E 6F,G 6F 6F 4 Discussion It is important to assess complex formation between EVs and lipoproteins as studies suggest that lipoprotein binding is a critical contributor to the biological identity of EVs, both in terms of cell signalling and transport (Ghebosu et al. 2024 2014 2004 2009 2002 2023 2024 2023 2020 2022 2023 2016 2019 2016 2015 2015 Current protocols to assess lipoprotein binding to small molecules consists of methods to separate bound and unbound drug (e.g., equilibrium dialysis, ultrafiltration or ultracentrifugation) followed by a small molecule detection method (e.g., liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry/LC‐MS or high‐performance affinity chromatography/HPAC) (Seyfinejad et al. 2021 2019 2005 2013 2021 2022 Here, we present a first‐of‐its‐kind, simple fluorometry‐based LAF assay to rapidly quantify the extent of binding between test agents and fluorescently labelled lipoproteins. Notably, the LAF assay does not rely on size‐based separation and detection of EVs, but rather measures binding‐induced changes in DiI labelling (binding and partitioning) of lipoproteins. EVs from various origins, including human, plant, nematode and bacteria, were assessed in the LAF assay, which was validated with small molecules, proteins, polymers and synthetic nanoparticles that have known binding interactions with lipoproteins. Even in the case of small molecules, the assay outperforms conventional techniques in terms of simplicity and speed. The results demonstrate that the LAF assay is capable of measuring EV interactions with VLDL, LDL and HDL, each of which display distinct EV binding patterns (or lack thereof). Additional validation was performed with cryo‐TEM, which enables visualization and quantification of binding between lipoproteins (lipid monolayer) and EVs (lipid bilayer). Lipoproteins are also implicated in various (patho)physiological conditions and are capable of aggregating in vitro and in vivo, for example, in atherosclerosis (Guha and Gursky 2011 2007 2024 2022 2021 2022 2025 2021 2022 1982 2016 1981 1 TABLE 1 Comparison of approximate apolipoprotein concentrations used in the LAF assay and (patho)physiological levels.

The findings revealed that HDL displayed minimal binding to EVs, while cancer EVs bound more to LDL than non‐cancerous ones, although differences were not apparent based on the metastatic potential of the originating cells. Additionally, EVs from highly metastatic cancer cell lines displayed increased binding to VLDL/plasma lipoproteins than EVs from non/poorly metastatic ones, suggesting a correlative or causative role of EV/lipoprotein complexes in metastasis. However, in plasma these differences were only observed for breast cancer EVs, while VLDL binding to EVs was distinct based on the metastatic potential of breast cancer and osteosarcoma cells. EV/lipoprotein complexes may have diagnostic potential in predicting the stage of cancer and differentiating cancerous states from healthy ones. The LAF assay may also prove valuable for other disease states in which EVs and lipoproteins are implicated, such as atherosclerosis (Chen et al. 2024 2022 2021 2022 2021 2021 2013 2021 2001 2005 2013 2021 2020 2015 2022 2022 2002 2017 In the future, it will be important to identify biomolecular surface compositions and physical membrane characteristics of EVs that promote complex formation with lipoproteins and their relation to homeostasis and disease pathology. It is important to note that while the LAF assay delivers robust signals, it infers lipoprotein‐EV binding indirectly via DiI, and therefore, remains semi‐quantitative, without yielding absolute binding values. Additionally, the assay is affected by the source of lipoprotein/plasma, which likely differs based on the donor, supplier and batches. Therefore, optimal assay conditions may need to be assessed for each batch using a positive control of binding (warfarin).
