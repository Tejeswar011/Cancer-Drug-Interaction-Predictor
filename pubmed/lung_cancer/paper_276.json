Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based cell therapies, initially designed for oncology, are rapidly advancing as a novel and highly targeted approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). By harnessing engineered immune cells to eliminate autoreactive immune components or restore immune homeostasis, CAR-based strategies offer new avenues beyond conventional immunosuppression. In this review, we summarize current applications of CAR-T cells in autoimmune diseases, and discuss emerging approaches including CAR-Tregs, chimeric autoantibody receptor T (CAAR-T) cells, CAR-NK cells, and CAR-macrophages. We also describe advances in CAR design, including antigen selection, co-stimulatory domains, and safety control mechanisms, which are critical for improving therapeutic precision and reducing side effects. In addition, we highlight the role of synthetic biology in enabling more flexible and controllable CAR functions. Finally, we discuss the main challenges facing clinical translation, such as antigen specificity, long-term persistence, and manufacturing feasibility. These developments collectively support the potential of CAR-based therapies as a next-generation option for autoimmune disease treatment. chimeric antigen receptor autoimmune disease cell therapy synthetic biology CAR-T cell National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

These autoimmune responses involve the activation of autoreactive lymphocyte clones and the production of autoantibodies against self-antigens, resulting in immune-mediated damage that affects multiple organs. Notably, autoreactive B-cell clones and autoantibodies targeting self-antigens are present even before the onset of clinical symptoms ( 1 AIDs exhibit significant complexity in both their underlying mechanisms and clinical manifestations, ranging from mild laboratory abnormalities to life-threatening acute organ failure. This heterogeneity poses substantial challenges in clinical management and therapeutic development. Currently, the primary therapeutic approach for AIDs relies on broad-spectrum immunosuppressants and neutralizing antibodies. While these agents can effectively control disease progression, complete remission is rarely achieved. For instance, although autoreactive B-cells play a critical role in autoantibody production in most AIDs, targeting them with monoclonal antibodies such as Rituximab and Inebilizumab has demonstrated only limited efficacy, largely due to the persistence of these cells in lymphoid organs and affected tissues ( 2 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based cell therapies—originally developed for B-cell malignancies, are now being repurposed for AIDs treatment. Specifically, autologous CAR-T cells targeting CD19 have shown rapid and sustained depletion of circulating autoreactive B-cells, leading to clinical and serological remission in RA ( 3 4 5 Recent studies have elucidated key characteristics of AIDs that distinguish them from cancers, including the pathological role of autoantibodies, the need for immune homeostasis reconstitution in solid tissues, and the poor quality of patient-derived immune cells. Such factors may limit the effectiveness of conventional CAR-T approaches. In response, researchers have pursued more tailored strategies, including in vivo 6 7 + 8 9 Beyond expanding cell platforms and refining CAR designs, advances in synthetic biology have introduced new possibilities for CAR-based therapies. For instance, the “OR-gate” design–such as CD19/BCMA bispecific CAR-T cells–enables targeting of either CD19 + + 10 11 In this review, we discuss recent advancements in CAR-based therapies for AIDs, focusing on improving efficacy and safety, selecting suitable cell platforms and CAR designs tailored to disease-specific characteristics, and leveraging synthetic biology to create innovative therapeutic strategies. Current treatments of autoimmune disease AIDs primarily result from inflammatory responses, cytolysis, and immune complex deposition, driven by the activation of autoreactive T and B-cells that continuously release excessive inflammatory factors, leading to tissue damage. Consequently, anti-inflammatory therapies have become a primary choice in AIDs treatment ( 12 13 14 To address these challenges, small-molecule drugs and neutralizing antibodies/receptors have become the alternative therapeutic strategies for AIDs. The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in mediating inflammatory cytokines production, including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), all of which contribute to AIDs pathogenesis ( 15 16 17 19 20 + 21 22 23 24 25 Despite these promising findings, IL-2 therapy faces challenges, including a short half-life requiring frequent dosing and limited efficacy in suppressing autoantibody production ( 26 27 28 NCT02550652 29 30 31 Current therapies for AIDs primarily aim to inhibit inflammatory responses and restore immune tolerance. Although some treatments have achieved temporary clinical success in specific AIDs subtypes, they are often limited by immunosuppression-associated infection, incomplete depletion of autoreactive cell, and the requirement for repeat dosing. Moreover, inter-patient heterogeneity and the complex nature of these diseases mean that a substantial proportion of patients fail to respond adequately to existing therapies ( 32 CAR-T therapies in tumor and autoimmune diseases Over the past decades, treatments for B-cell-driven malignancies have significantly benefitted from CAR-based strategies. CD19-targeted CAR-T cells, which induce potent B-cells depletion, have achieved remarkable success in clinical practice ( 33 35 in vitro 36 37 The fundamental structure of CARs typically comprises three components: an extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that recognizes the target antigen, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling domain. In therapies for B-cell malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma or B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the scFv are typically designed to target CD19, a surface marker consistently expressed throughout B-cell development ( 38 39 40 TRAC 41 in vitro 42  Figure 1 Figure 1 Mechanisms of target cell apoptosis induced by CAR-T cells. CAR-T cells eliminate target cells through two primary apoptotic pathways. One involves the secretion of perforin to create pores in the target cell membrane, allowing granzyme B to enter and activate caspase cascades. The second mechanism involves FasL expression on CAR-T cells, which engages Fas on target cells, triggering Caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling. The illustrated CAR construct contains a scFv targeting CD19, a co-stimulatory domain (e.g., CD28 or 4-1BB), and a T cell activation domain (CD3ζ). FasL, Fas ligand; scFv, single-chain variable fragment; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor. Diagram illustrating CAR-T cell interaction with a target cell. The CAR-T cell has a CD19-targeting scFv, co-stimulatory domain, and T cell activation domain. It releases perforin and granzyme B, initiating caspase signaling that leads to apoptosis. Fas and FasL interactions further promote apoptosis. Beyond oncology, the application of CAR-T therapy has recently expanded into the field of AIDs, where it shows great promise as a novel immunomodulatory approach ( 43  Table 1 + − 44 45 Table 1 Published AIDs treatments by B-cell-targeting CAR-T cells.

IMNM, Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy; LN, lupus nephritis. However, regarding the differences in the mechanisms of AIDs and tumor, CAR-T strategies should be carefully evaluated before clinical use. In cancer patients, CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are major safety concerns, both arising from excessive cytokine release (e.g., IFN-γ, IL-6) by activated CAR-T cells. In a compassionate use report from Fabian Müller et al., 15 patients with severe AIDs—including 8 with SLE, 3 with idiopathic inflammatory myositis, and 4 with systemic sclerosis—were treated with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. The treatment induced profound B-cell depletion and achieved sustained drug-free remission in all patients, with only one in each disease group experienced manageable grade 2 CRS and ICANS ( 46 47 48 in vivo 49 Nevertheless, the role of lymphodepletion in AID treatment may differ from that in cancers, as the preservation of autologous immune cell subsets–particularly Tregs–is crucial for re-establishing immune homeostasis after CAR-T mediated depletion of pathogenic cells. Among available regimens, cyclophosphamide selectively depletes alloreactive T cells while sparing Tregs, facilitating the reconstitution of immune tolerance ( 50 51 37 46 52 in vivo 53 54 in vivo 55  Figure 2 Figure 2 Strategies for CAR-T cell generation: in vitro in vivo (A) in vitro (B) In vivo in vivo (C) TRAC TRAC TRAV TRAJ TRAC Flowchart illustrating the production and use of CAR-T cells.

Chronic B-cell aplasia is the most expected side effect in cancer patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, often necessitate life-long immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) to prevent infections ( 49 36 4 + + + 56 57 58 4 59 in vivo 4 37 60 CAR-engineered T cells tailored to the characteristics of autoimmune diseases The applicability of CAR-T therapy needs to be carefully designed and evaluated to address the characteristics of AIDs. One prominent concern is the heightened risk of infection due to B-cell depletion, especially in patients previously exposed to immunosuppressive regimens. To mitigate potential safety issues, researchers have developed CAR constructs equipped with “safety switches” that allow for conditional control of CAR-T cell activation and persistence. For instance, inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9) functions as an “off switch”, triggering apoptosis of CAR-T cells upon administration of Rimiducid ( 61 62  Figure 3 Figure 3 Controllable CAR-T cells with inducible safety switches. (A) (B) Diagram showing two switch mechanisms in T cells. Panel A, labeled “Off” Switch, illustrates how rimiducid induces apoptosis through iCasp9 dimerization. Panel B, labeled “On” Switch, shows rapamycin facilitating T cell activation via FKBP 12 and FRB interaction. Both panels depict scFv targeting and CD28/4-1BB, CD3ζ signaling pathways with CAR integration in genomic DNA. While long-term CAR expression is often essential in cancer therapy, time-dependent CAR expression has gained favor in the context of AIDs due to its improved safety profile. Transient CAR-T cells are generated by transfecting T cells with CAR-encoding mRNA, allowing temporary CAR expression and reducing the risk of prolonged off-target effects or cytokine storms. A recent clinical study in 14 patients with myasthenia gravis demonstrated that transient CAR-T cells induced clinical benefit with favorable safety and tolerability ( 63 64 in vivo 65 66 67 in vivo Unlike B-cell malignancies where CD19 + 68 69 NCT04422912 NCT05451212 70 Given the critical role of Tregs in restoring immune homeostasis, their therapeutic use in AIDs is gaining attention. However, their low abundance in circulation poses a barrier to clinical applications. To overcome this, researchers have engineered Tregs (EngTregs) by transducing FoxP3 +  Figure 4 + 71 FoxP3 in vitro 72 in vivo 73 FoxP3 74 75 76 77 78 FOXP3 79 in vivo 80 81 NCT04817774 NCT05234190 in vivo 82 83 84 85 86 Figure 4 Engineered CAR-T cells and CAR-Tregs for autoimmune disease treatment.

Panel D depicts CAR-Treg cell, highlighting immune suppression pathways via IL-2, TGF-β, and IL-10. Key components like co-stimulatory domains and activation pathways are labeled. Nevertheless, the use of patient-derived autologous T cells for CAR-T manufacturing presents practical challenges, including prolonged production timelines and high commercial costs. These limitations have spurred interest in developing allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” CAR-T products to facilitate broader clinical application ( 87 88 TRAC 9 PDCD1 89 PDCD1 90 Utilizing innate immune cells for CAR-based therapies in autoimmune diseases In malignancies, CAR-T therapy faces several limitations inherent to its mechanism and technical requirements. These include poor tissue infiltration, susceptibility to exhaustion, complex immune regulatory environments, and excessive cytokine release upon activation ( 91 92 To address these challenges, alternative immune cell types have been investigated as potential platforms for CAR engineering. NK cells are MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic immune cells that are capable of lysing target cells by secreting granzyme B and perforin. Unlike T cells, NK cells derived from healthy donors can be readily prepared into off-the-shelf CAR-NK products, thereby avoiding the dysfunction or immunosuppression often seen in AIDs, meanwhile shortening patients’ waiting times and significantly lower treatment costs ( 93 94 95 NCT06010472 NCT06421701  Table 2 Table 2 Clinical trials using CAR-based cells for AIDs therapy.

Macrophages have also emerged as another promising cell platform for CAR-based therapies, particularly for addressing the limited infiltration and immunosuppressive environments in solid tissues ( 96 97 + 98 Synthetic biology expands the potential to CAR-based therapies for autoimmune diseases Synthetic biology, a transformative discipline that emerged in the 21st century, focuses on constructing programmable biological circuits using fundamental biological elements such as DNA and genes. Its central objective is to engineer “artificial cells” that can sense their environment and respond to specific stimuli. This rapidly evolving field holds significant promise for advancing CAR-based cell therapies. For instance, although anti-CD19 CAR-T cells have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in depleting B-cells, their utility in AIDs is limited by two main issues: off-target effects—since CD19 is not expressed on autoantibody-producing plasma cells, and the potential downregulation or loss of CD19 on B-cells after repeated interactions with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells ( 99 100 101 Another advanced design in CAR therapies involves the implementation of “AND gates” logic ( 88 102 103  Figure 5 Figure 5 Logic-gated CAR-T cells for precise targeting of autoreactive cells. (A) (B) Illustration of “OR\"- and “AND\"-gated CAR designs. Panel A shows two types of cells, B cell and plasma cell, interacting with anti-CD19 and anti-BCMA receptors respectively, highlighting co-stimulatory and activation domains in the “OR” gate CAR. Panel B demonstrates an autoantibody-producing cell engaging with anti-BCMA and a labeled autoantigen, representing the “AND” gate CAR, with co-stimulatory and activation domains. Beyond logic gates, synthetic biology has also enabled the development of advanced artificial signaling systems, notably the synthetic Notch (SynNotch) platform. Modeled after endogenous Notch pathway, SynNotch system utilizes a mechanically activated extracellular domain—such as an scFv binding to an autoantigen—to initiate a proteolytic cascade. This results in the release of natural or artificial transcription factors, which subsequently drive the expression of specific gene or secondary regulators ( 104 For instance, CAR-NK cells, while offering certain advantages over CAR-T cells, face challenges due to their short lifespan—typically less than 10 days—which necessitates frequent infusions to maintain sufficient cell number ( 105 106 107 108  Figure 6 Figure 6 SynNotch-regulated CAR-NK cells for conditional IL-15 expression. (A) (B) Diagram comparing CAR-NK and synNotch CAR-NK cell mechanisms. Panel A shows CAR-NK cells with antigens activating co-stimulatory and activation domains, promoting NK cell survival. Panel B illustrates synNotch CAR-NK cells with two antigen sites. Antigen-A triggers the pathway, while antigen-B initiates transcription via a cleavage site, enhancing NK cell proliferation through IL15 induction. Conclusion and further thinkings CAR-based cell therapy, which has demonstrated remarkable success in treating malignancies, has also made significant strides in the management of AIDs. Despite encouraging preclinical and early clinical findings, several challenges must be addressed to ensure its safe and effective application in the autoimmune setting. First, AIDs patients often present with compromised immune cells due to long-term immunosuppressive treatment. Moreover, unlike in cancer, lymphodepletion may not be desirable in AIDs treatment, as preserving endogenous immune cells is essential for restoring immune homeostasis and preventing long-term immunodeficiency. Additionally, CAR-T cell therapy can induce acute B-cell aplasia, thereby increasing the risk of infections. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed refined CAR construction equipped with safety switches, and use mRNA-based transient CAR expression, enhancing the controllability of CAR activation and minimizing adverse effects. Therapeutic specificity has also been optimized using chimeric autoantibody receptor T (CAAR-T) cells and multi-antigen targeting CARs, such as CD19/BCMA bispecific constructs, to eliminate pathogenic B-cells while sparing normal immune components. Furthermore, CAR-Tregs have emerged as a strategy for restoring immune tolerance by delivering regulatory signals directly to inflamed tissues, thus achieving therapeutic effects with minimal systemic disruption. In parallel, novel immune cell types such as NK cells and macrophages have been investigated as alternative platforms for CAR engineering. CAR-NK cells offer advantages including MHC-independent killing, reduced cytokine release, and the potential for “off-the-shelf” manufacturing, with promising results in early-stage trials. CAR-macrophages, on the other hand, demonstrate superior tissue infiltration and remodeling capacity, making them particularly attractive for targeting localized, organ-specific AIDs. Synthetic biology has further expanded the potential of CAR-based therapies by introducing programmable logic and dynamic control systems. Logic gate-based CAR constructions allow for more precise discrimination of pathological cells, while the SynNotch signaling pathways enable context-dependent activation of therapeutic functions, such as inducible IL-15 production in CAR-NK cells (  Table 3 Table 3 Engineered CAR-immune cells in AIDs therapies.

Rigorous validation of safety, durability, and immunological outcomes is essential. Critical clinical design considerations include defining therapeutic windows, optimizing preconditioning regimens, and developing standardized trial protocols to account for disease heterogeneity. Ultimately, interdisciplinary collaboration across immunology, bioengineering, and clinical medicine will be vital to translate these therapies into effective treatments for AIDs.
