Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most concerned aging-related diseases in the worldwide, yet the investigation of immune senescence in joint and related therapies are still poorly identified. Single-cell sequencing analysis and immunofluorescence of OA synovium reveal increased senescent macrophages in trauma-induced OA compared to controls. Importantly, senescent macrophages in OA synovium showed enhanced M1 polarization, mitochondrial damage and impaired efferocytosis, which could lead to increased senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) in the joint and further exacerbate OA. Hence, a novel senotherapeutic nanoparticle is developed using chloroquine (CQ)-bearing polymers (pCQ) for targeted delivery of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to synovial macrophages, termed as pCQ/SOD. The nanoparticle achieves efficient intracellular delivery of SOD to synovial macrophages. RNA-seq results reveal that pCQ/SOD nanoparticle inhibits macrophage senescence via p53 and cellular senescence signaling pathway, further reprograms M1-to-M2 repolarization. Furthermore, the delivered SOD inhibits BAX-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) which further reduces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release and SASP secretion, while pCQ promotes macrophage efferocytosis against apoptotic cells via STAT3/ADAM17/MerTK signaling. As a result, intraarticular injection of pCQ/SOD nanoparticles in mice successfully alleviates not only trauma-induced OA, but aging-induced OA as well. The developed senotherapeutic nanoparticle in this study offers an effective approach for remodeling of senescent macrophages in synovium and a promising therapeutic strategy for OA treatment.

Based on the evidence that synovial macrophages in OA showed an increased expression of senescent biomarkers and functional decline, senotherapeutic nanoparticles containing pCQ and SOD termed as pCQ/SOD were prepared. Functionally, pCQ/SOD led to M1-to-M2 repolarization, reduced ROS-mediated mtDNA release and SASPs secretion to block cellular senescence, and rescued the impaired efferocytosis against apoptotic fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) via STAT3/ADAM17/MerTK signaling to remodel local aging microenvironment. As a result, pCQ/SOD nanoparticles efficiently inhibited macrophage senescence and relieved aging-induced and trauma-induced OA in vivo Fig. 1 2 Results 2.1 OA synovial macrophages exhibit increased senescent phenotypes The senescence of synovial macrophages in OA synovial tissue is our first concern. We firstly examined a typical senescent biomarker, p53, in macrophages of human synovium from OA patients and controls. Co-immunofluorescence (IF) of p53 (red) and macrophage marker, CD68 (green) revealed increased senescent synovial macrophages in OA compared to the controls ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 39 [44] [45] [46] [47] Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Examination of macrophage senescence in OA synovium.

(h) Gene expression correlated with macrophage functions in OA between senescent and non-senescent macrophages. Data are shown as the mean ± s.d. * p p p p Fig. 2 To investigate the mechanisms of OA senescent macrophages in disease progression, we specifically analyzed functional alterations between OA senescent macrophages and non-senescent macrophages. Senescent macrophage cluster was distinguished from non-senescent macrophages in OA synovium via enhanced expression of senescence-related genes, such as p21 Trp53 Rb1 Glb1 Fig. 2 Csf2ra Tnfrsf1a Tnfrsf11a Tnfrsf1b Igfbp7 S100a6 48 8 10 49 TLR4 CD163 50 51 Fig. 2 BAX BAK1 Fis1 Opa1 [52] [53] [54] Fig. 2 55 CD47 Jak1 Stat3 Adam17 38 56 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Since synovial macrophages are more likely to polarize to M1 state, the relationship between M1 macrophages and senescent macrophages in OA synovium needs to be identified. We found that M1 macrophages in murine OA synovium partly showed p53 expression via co-immunofluorescence ( Fig. S1a Fig. S1b 2.2 Construction of pCQ for intracellular delivery of SOD to macrophages Motivated by the above results, we next aimed to construct a senotherapeutic approach for remodeling senescent macrophages for OA treatment. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was reported to scavenge ROS, benefit for inhibiting senescence and repair ROS-induced mitochondrial damage [ 27 57 Fig. 3 S2a 58 Fig. S2b 1 Fig. S3 59 60 Fig. 3 pCQ for SOD delivery into OA synovial macrophages.

As shown in Fig. 3 Fig S4b, d and e Fig. S4c and f Fig. S5a Fig. S5b and c Moreover, we noticed that there are many clustered fluorescent spots in Fig. 3 Fig. S6 Fig. S6a–b Fig. S6d 61 Fig. S6e–f We then investigated synovial macrophage-targeted ability of pCQ/SOD in vivo Fig. 3 Fig. 3 2 2 in vitro Fig. S7a–b 2 2 Fig. S7c 2.3 pCQ/SOD inhibits macrophage senescence and reprogramms M1-to-M2 polarization To assess the role of pCQ/SOD in relieving macrophage senescence, we constructed in vitro in vitro 62 Fig. 4 63 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 The effects of pCQ/SOD nanoparticles on macrophage senescence and polarization in vitro p p p p Fig. 4 We also constructed a H 2 2 64 2 2 in vitro 2 2 Fig. S8 Fig. S8h Based on the anti-aging activity of pCQ/SOD on macrophages, we further investigated the underlying mechanisms. We performed RNA-sequencing of aged bone-marrow derived macrophages (aged BMDMs, distracted from 18-month-old mice) treated with or without pCQ/SOD for 24 h. We observed 2200 up-regulated genes and 1667 down-regulated genes after treatment with pCQ/SOD ( Fig. S9a Fig. S9b Fig. 4 Ccnb2, Serpine1, Ccnd1, Ccne2, Chek1, Cdk1 Gadd45b, Mdm2 Fig. 4 Fig. S9c Fig. S9d Fig. 4 2.4 pCQ/SOD inhibits MOMP and enhances macrophage efferocytosis against senescence In order to investigate pCQ/SOD-mediated alterations in senescent macrophages, we specifically focus on mitochondrial function, which are impaired in OA senescent macrophages and most likely to be influenced by SOD in ROS-mediated cellular senescence [ 65 48 66 Tmbim4 Tmbim6 67 Fig. 4 Fig. S9c Fig. 5 Fig. S10a–c 2 2 66 Fig. 5 Fig. S10a and d Fig. 5 The mechanisms of pCQ/SOD modulating macrophage senescence.

Data are shown as means ± SD. * p p p p Fig. 5 In addition to the oxidative stress triggered by ROS and mitochondrial alterations, OA senescent macrophages also exhibit significant impairment in macrophage efferocytosis. This could lead to the accumulation of apoptotic cells which secret more SASPs, further exacerbates cellular senescence in turn and worsen OA symptoms [ 18 43 68 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 2 2 Fig. S11 69 70 Fig. S11d and e Fig. 5 S11 Fig. 5 S11 Based on the above results, pCQ or pCQ/SOD could greatly promote macrophage efferocytosis by upregulating the expression of MerTK in senescent macrophages. In this context, we further explored the mechanisms underlying the upregulation of MerTK expression. We noticed one of the efferocytosis-related signals, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, was enriched in the KEGG enrichment of RNA-seq ( Fig. 4 36 38 Fig. 5 38 71 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 2.5 Intraarticular injection of pCQ/SOD alleviates DMM-induced OA and ACLT-induced OA Building on the above in vitro In vivo Fig. S12a In vivo Fig. S12b Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Treatment of DMM or ACLT-induced OA with pCQ/SOD.

Synovial macrophages, which are the most involved immune cells in OA pathology, have been long proved to function via polarization to different states [ 8 Nature 72 73 74 75 To conclude, our study not only reveals synovial macrophage senescence in OA progression, but establishes an effective and promising treatment for OA via the intervention of immunosenescence. It is believed that macrophage-targeted therapies possess more precise targeting ability due to the physical property of synovium and phagocytosis of macrophages, while chondrocyte-targeted therapies call for effective penetration of cartilage via material-based or drug-based therapies [ 76 4 Methods 4.1 Materials Methacryloyl chloride (95 %), DEAEMA (98 %), Triethylamine (TEA, 99 %) and 2,2′-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN, 98 %) were purchased from Shanghai Titan Technology (Shanghai, China). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, 99.77 %), Chloroquine diphosphate (CQ, 98 %) and 4-cyano-4-(thiobenzoylthio)pentanoic acid (CPADB, 99 %) were purchased from Bide Pharmatech (Shanghai, China). SOD was purchased from Yuanye Bio (Shanghai, China). Hoechst 33342 and WST-8 were purchased from Beyotime (Shanghai, China). The expression and purification of EGFP was carried out according to a previous reported study [ 77 4.2 Synthesis of MACQ HCQ (2.0 g, 5.95 mmol) and TEA (1.8g, 17.86 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane under ice-cooling. Methacryloyl chloride (0.7g, 7.15 mmol) was added to the HCQ solution dropwise with stirring at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, followed by washing with saturated sodium carbonate and saturated salt water sequentially. The crude product obtained by evaporating solvent under vacuum was further purified by silica gel chromatography (50 : 1 dichloromethane: methanol) to obtain MACQ (2.0g, 84.6 %) as light yellow oily liquid. 1 3 δ Fig. S1a J J J J J J J J J J J J 4.3 Synthesis of pCQ pCQ was synthesized by RAFT polymerization. Specifically, the feeding ratio of [DEAEMA]/[MACQ]/[CPADB]/[AIBN] was fixed as 100:83:1:0.3. DEAEMA (213.5 mg, 1.152 mmol), MACQ (386.4 mg, 0.957 mmol), CPADB (3.2 mg, 0.011 mmol) and AIBN (0.57 mg, 0.003 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide, and the solution was further encapsulated in a Schlenk line and fully deoxygenated with nitrogen for three times. After polymerized at 70 °C for 24 h, the solution was placed in an ice bath to quickly terminate the polymerization. The solution was dialyzed in N,N-dimethylformamide for 24 h, followed by 48 h in water (membrane cut-off M W 1 3 4.4 Polymer characterization The synthesized polymer was characterized by 1 (1) d,e l d,e Fig. S1b l Fig. S1b (1) 6 m + 6 n n = I d , e I l Molecular weight of the synthesized polymer was analyzed by GPC operated in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The proportion of polymerization units and molecular weights of polymers were shown in Fig. S1b 4.5 Polymer/protein complexes preparation and characterization Briefly, proteins were mixed with pCQ in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) or cell culture medium, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to form polymer/protein complexes. The complexes were further diluted before characterization. The size and particle dispersion (PDI) of the nanoparticles were measured by DLS (Malvern, UK) at 25 °C. The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were characterized by TEM (Hitachi, JPN). 4.6 Determination of protein loading efficiency (PLE) and protein loading content (PLC) Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) was labeled on SOD to quantitatively detect the protein concentration in the system by fluorescence spectrophotometer. Briefly, the pCQ/SOD-FITC solution was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 15 min and the unbound proteins in the supernatant solution were quantified. SOD-FITC only was also centrifuged as a control to avoid the effect of centrifugation on free proteins. PLE and PLC were defined as follows: PLE = (weight of loaded proteins/weight of proteins in feed) × 100 %, PLC = (weight of loaded proteins/total weight of loaded proteins and carrier) × 100 %. 4.7 Determination of protein release ratio We measured and calculated the protein release ratio of pCQ/SOD-FITC nanoparticles at different times using centrifugation and fluorescence spectrophotometer. Briefly, FITC was labeled on SOD to quantitatively detect the protein concentration in the system by fluorescence spectrophotometer. The pCQ/SOD-FITC solution was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 15 min and the unbound proteins in the supernatant solution were quantified. SOD-FITC only was also centrifuged as a control to avoid the effect of centrifugation on free proteins. At different intervals, the supernatants of the nanoparticles after centrifuged were taken to detect the free protein release, and the weight of protein loaded in the nanoparticles at 0 h was used as the total loaded protein. The formulation for calculating protein release ratio is as follows: (the weight of total loaded protein - the weight of loaded protein at different times)/the weight of total loaded protein. 4.8 Cell culture and intracellular protein delivery Mouse mononuclear macrophages cells (Raw264.7 cells), mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH-3T3 cells) were incubated in DMEM cell culture medium (GIBCO) at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 For intracellular protein delivery, cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. Cargo proteins were complexed with pCQ in 100 μL culture medium for 30 min, then diluted with 400 μL medium containing 10 % serum. The cells were washed with PBS and treated with the polymer/protein complexes for 12 h at 37 °C. After that, the treated cells were washed with PBS, subsequently, the protein delivery efficiency were analyzed. The cells were observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica, TCS SP8, Germany) and the delivery efficacy was quantitatively analyzed by flow cytometry (BD, FACSCelesta, USA). 4.9 Cellular uptake pathway investigation To investigate the internalization mechanism of the polymer/protein complexes, RAW264.7 cells were pre-incubated with different endocytosis inhibitors respectively, including cytochalasin D (10 μM), ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA, 50 μM), Wortmannin (100 nM), Genistein (700 μM), Nystatin (25 μg/mL), Chlorpromazine (20 μM), Dynasore (20 μM), methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD, 10 mM) and NaN 3 4.10 Cell viability assay The cytotoxicity of pCQ was measured by the standard cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Briefly, Raw264.7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured until 40–50 % confluence. The cells were then incubated with pCQ at concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 μg/mL for 24 h, subsequently refreshed with medium containing 10 % FBS, and further incubated for another 24 h. The CCK-8 solution was added to the treated cells and incubated for 1 h. Absorbance at the wavelength of 450 nm was measured to calculate cell viability. 4.11 Animals C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China). All animal experiments were performed in a pathogen-free animal facility at Xinhua Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University of Medicine. Institutional Ethics Committee of Xinhua Hospital approved related experiments and the animal allowance number of Xinhua Hospital is SYXK-2018-0038. 4.12 In vivo 4-mon-old male C57BL/6 mice were obtained for detection of targeting ability of pCQ/SOD. SOD was labeled with Cy5.5 (SOD-Cy5.5). The concentration of pCQ for intraarticular injection was 1.6 μg/μL pCQ/SOD-Cy5.5 (30 U/μL) was intraarticularly injected in the murine joints (SOD: 6200 U/mg, each injection for 0.024 mg SOD). Knee joints were collected 12 h after injection for further examination. 4.13 Experimental models Aging-induced spontaneous OA in mice were constructed in 18-month-old male mice and 3-month-old male mice were established as young control (n = 6). Knee joint samples were collected after 6 weeks of intervention. Trauma-induced OA were maintained by DMM or ACLT surgery in 3-month-old male mice (n = 6), in which the medial meniscotibial ligament (for DMM) or the anterior cruciate ligament (for ACLT) was transected in the murine knee joint after anesthetized. Sham operations were done on independent mice with same gender and age. Knee joints were collected 4 weeks after DMM or ACLT surgery. The concentration of pCQ for intraarticular injection was 1.6 μg/μL. To test the efficacy of pCQ/SOD, 5 μL PBS, free pCQ, free SOD (30 U/μL) or pCQ/SOD (30 U/μL) was injected into murine joints (SOD: 6200 U/mg, each injection for 0.024 mg SOD). 4.14 Human samples We collected human synovium samples from 7 OA patients who needed to perform total knee replacement surgery and 3 patients requiring joint repair who never suffered osteoarthritis in their history. Institutional Ethics Committee of Xinhua Hospital has already approved this study. 4.15 Pathological staining and immunochemical techniques Safranin O and fast green staining were applied to examine the extent of cartilage degradation in OA models. CD68 (Cell Signaling Technology), Vimentin, p53, iNOS and CD206 (Abclonal) in pathological sections were examined via immunofluorescence and obtained using Zeiss microscope, while MMP13 and ACAN (Abclonal) were examined via immunohistochemistry. Joint samples and synovium were collected for preparation of paraffin sections. After treated with pepsin to repair antigen, the sections were blocked using BSA to decrease non-specific bindings of antibody. Furthermore, primary antibodies with appropriate concentrations (according to protocols) were added on the surface of slices for 10 h in 4 °C refrigerator. After primary antibodies (rabbit source) incubation, we next used secondary antibody (anti-rabbit) from IHC kit (MaxVision, China) to incubate slices for 10 min. Slices were then washed using TBST solution and stained for immunohistochemical staining according to the protocol of DAB Plus kit or for immunofluorescence according to the protocol of abs50012, absin. Related quantifications were measured via ImageJ. 4.16 Macrophage culture and assay Bone marrow cells were collected via flush of murine bone marrow cavity, and then treated with 10 ng/mL mouse M-CSF in DMEM medium with 10 % FBS for 12 days for development of BMDMs. Raw 264.7 cells were induced by LPS (100 ng/mL) for 24 h to induce M1 polarization and were induced by IL-4 (1000 U/mL) treatment for 24 h to induce M2 polarization. Macrophage senescence was induced in vitro 2 2 78 79 4.17 Flow cytometry Raw264.7 cells were treated in different conditions and labeled with the following reagents for identification of M1 or M2 macrophages: PE/Cyanine5 anti-mouse CD86 Antibody (Biolegend, 105015), FITC anti-mouse CD206 (MMR) Antibody (Biolegend, 141703). Related controls are PE/Cyanine5 Rat IgG2a, κ Isotype Ctrl Antibody (Biolegend, 400509), FITC Rat IgG2a, κ Isotype Ctrl Antibody (Biolegend, 400505). After suspension of Raw264.7 cells, they were incubated with related reagents for 30 min, and analyzed via Guava Easycyte 12HT (Luminex) after flushed by PBS. 4.18 Western blot assay Proteins of cells were obtained after lysed in RIPA buffer for 30 min on ice and quantified via BCA assay. After SDS-PAGE of proteins, the samples were transferred to NC membranes. After blocked with 5 % BSA for 1 h and incubated with antibodies (such as p-STAT3, STAT3, GAPDH from Cell Signaling Technology, and ADAM17 from Abclonal) overnight at 4 °C, the appropriate HRP-coupled secondary antibody was then added and detected through chemiluminescence (Millipore). Related quantifications were measured via ImageJ. 4.19 qPCR analysis We used TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for extraction of RNA and quantify by Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We then used PrimeScript RT Master Mix Kit (Takara Bio Inc., China) to obtain cDNA from related mRNA. The transcriptive levels of certain genes were then tested by qPCR. Housekeeping gene GAPDH was established as control. Sequences of primers for the genes were listed as below: GAPDH-F: TGACCTCAACTACATGGTCTACA.
