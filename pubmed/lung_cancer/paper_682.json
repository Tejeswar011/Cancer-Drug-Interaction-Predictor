Taurine Upregulated Gene 1 (TUG1) is an lncRNA that is overexpressed in many types of cancer and has been implicated in resolving R-loops, thereby maintaining genomic integrity. However, the full spectrum of its protein interactions and stress-responsive dynamics remains unclear. Here, we employed CRISPR-assisted RNA-protein interaction detection (CARPID) combined with mass spectrometry to comprehensively identify the interacting proteins of TUG1 in HEK293T cells. Using three distinct single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting different regions of TUG1, we consistently identified 17 TUG1-interacting proteins under basal conditions. Upon camptothecin (CPT) treatment, which induces R-loop formation, the number of associated proteins increased to 25. Under these stress conditions, the protein sets identified by each sgRNA showed greater overlap, suggesting a more conserved pattern of TUG1-protein interactions in response to R-loop accumulation. Many of these proteins are known R-loop-associated factors, including DEAD/DEAH-box RNA helicases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs), indicating that TUG1 engages R-loop regulatory machinery to maintain genome integrity. Our study provides new insights into lncRNA-mediated R-loop regulation and its role in genome maintenance.

Conventional RNA-protein interaction mapping techniques, such as chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) or affinity purification-mass spectrometry (MS), have provided valuable insights into lncRNA-protein interactions but are often limited by crosslinking biases, indirect interactions, and the inability to capture dynamic or weakly interacting proteins ( 24 25 26 27 25 In this study, we used CARPID to systematically identify TUG1-interacting proteins in HEK293T cells, under both normal conditions and in response to camptothecin (CPT)-induced replication stress, which promotes R-loop accumulation. Using three distinct single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), we identified a set of TUG1-associated proteins in both conditions. A substantial proportion of these proteins are known R-loop regulators. These findings suggest that TUG1 dynamically modulates its protein interactions in response to replication stress, reinforcing its role in R-loop resolution and genomic maintenance. By integrating CARPID with MS, our study provides a comprehensive proteomic landscape of TUG1-associated proteins, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated R-loop regulation. Materials and Methods Cell culture and transfection HEK293T cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Japan) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 1x Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Supplementary Table 1 Cell proliferation assay A total of 2 × 10 5 Single-molecule fluorescent in situ Cells were seeded in 96-well half-area film bottom microplates (Corning, NY, USA, Cat. #4680) and incubated for 24 h. Single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiment was conducted using the ViewRNA Cell Plus Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. TUG1 transcripts were detected using a type1 probe set mixture of exon 1 (ViewRNA Probe Set; Assay ID: VA1-6000856), exon 2 (ViewRNA Probe Set; Assay ID: VA1-11879), and exon 3 (ViewRNA Probe Set; Assay ID: VPMFW2G), in a 1:1:1 ratio. Cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA). Images obtained with a confocal microscope TiE-A1R (Nikon, Japan) were analysed by NIS-Elements viewer software (Nikon). R-loop detection via slot blot Total nucleic acid was extracted from cell nuclei using NucleoSpin Tissue kits (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Germany). The purified DNA was treated with or without 1 U of RNase H (New England Biolabs) and incubated overnight at 37°C. The samples were subsequently applied to positively charged Nylon Membranes (Roche, Switzerland), assembled within the BioDot-SF microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad, CA, USA), using TBS buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). The blotted DNA was crosslinked to the membrane using a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker 2400 (Stratagene, CA, USA) at 120 mJ/cm 2 Design of sgRNA The sgRNAs were designed as previously described by Bandaru et al 28 29 https://www.snapgene.com/ https://gggenome.dbcls.jp/ Supplementary Table 1 26 et al 25 sgRNA-expressing vector construction Oligonucleotides with BbsI restriction enzyme recognition sequences added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the designed sgRNA sequence were synthesized. These sgRNA oligos were inserted into the CasRx pre-gRNA cloning backbone vector (a gift from Patrick Hsu, Addgene plasmid # 109054) ( 26 Assessment of sgRNA cleavage efficiency The sgRNA cleavage efficiency was examined using a previously established protocol ( 26 5 Supplementary Table 1 CARPID The CARPID was performed following a previously established protocol ( 25 6 Nano-liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry The proteins in each gel slice underwent a series of treatments: they were first reduced using 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56°C for 1 h, followed by alkylation with 55 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 45 min in the absence of light. Subsequently, digestion was performed using 10 μg/ml modified trypsin (Pierce, MS Grade, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C for 16 h. The resulting peptides were then extracted using a solution of 1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile, followed by vacuum drying and dissolution in a solution containing 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The mass spectra were acquired using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a nanoflow UHPLC system (ADVANCE UHPLC, AMR Inc., Japan) equipped with an Advanced Captive Spray SOURCE (AMR Inc.). The peptide mixtures were initially loaded onto a C18 ID 0.1 × 20 mm, 5 μm (particle size) trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently fractionated by a C18, ID 0.075 × 500 mm, particle size 3 μm column (CERI, Japan). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min using a linear gradient of 5–35% solvent B (100% acetonitrile) in solvent A (100% H 2 Mass spectrometry data analysis The raw data files were searched against the Homo sapiens H. sapiens ftp://ftp.thegpm.org/fasta/cRAP The rank products test ( 30 P Gene ontology analysis Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using Enrichr ( https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ 31 P Statistical analysis The results are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or standard deviation (SD), as specified.

A total of 25 sgRNAs were designed across nine single-stranded regions of TUG1, as Cas13 nuclease activity depends on RNA secondary structure and preferentially cleaves single-stranded regions ( Fig. 2A 28 Fig. 2A Fig. 2B Fig. 2C Fig. 2D Supplementary Table 2 Comprehensive identification of TUG1-interacting proteins using CARPID Building on our optimized CARPID system, we systematically identified TUG1-interacting proteins using three different sgRNAs (sgTUG1_1, sgTUG1_2, sgTUG1_3) targeting spatially distant single-stranded regions of TUG1. To minimize non-specific signals resulting from stochastic binding, we subtracted the MS signal values obtained from sgNoTarget-transfected cells from those of TUG1 sgRNA-transfected cells. To evaluate the reproducibility of the CARPID assay, we conducted biological triplicates for each of the three sgRNAs targeting TUG1.

These proteins exhibited robust enrichment across all replicates, with high abundance and statistical significance, indicating that they represent high-confidence TUG1-interacting proteins (see Materials and Methods for statistical criteria) ( Fig. 4A Supplementary Table 3 Fig. 4B 20 35 38 39 40 41 35 , 40 , 42 Fig. 4C To evaluate the specificity of the CARPID assay, we also applied the sgRNA approach to identify proteins that interact with another well-characterized lncRNA MALAT1 ( 25 , 43 Fig. 4D Supplementary Table 4 r r Fig. 3 Supplementary Table 5 Fig. 4E Supplementary Table 6 CPT treatment enhances associations with RNA/DNA hybrid-interacting proteins Next, we conducted CARPID in CPT-treated cells to investigate changes in TUG1-associated proteins under replication stress conditions ( Supplementary Table 7 Fig. 3 r Fig. 3 CPT exposure increased the number of TUG1-interacting proteins compared to untreated conditions, identifying 50, 55 and 44 consistently and significantly enriched proteins for sgTUG1_1, sgTUG1_2 and sgTUG1_3, respectively ( Fig. 5A Supplementary Table 8 Fig. 5B–D Supplementary Table 3 35 , 44 , 45 Fig. 5B Supplementary Table 8 Fig. 5C D Supplementary Tables 3 8 Fig. 5  CPT-induced replication stress increases TUG1-protein interactions identified by CARPID. 10 P n Among the proteins identified under CPT treatment, 25 were consistently detected across all three sgRNAs. This set included 13 of the 17 proteins previously identified under untreated conditions, while 12 were newly identified following CPT treatment ( Fig. 5E 46 47 35 , 44 , 45 In addition, the number of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs) identified increased from two to five. HNRNPs are a family of RBPs that regulate various aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, stability, transport and translation ( 48 49 50 52 CPT-induced changes in the TUG1 interactome reveal recruitment of RNA processing and genome stability factors We next aimed to identify proteins that exhibited increased interaction with TUG1 following CPT treatment. For each sgRNA, we extracted proteins whose association with TUG1 was enhanced under CPT-induced R-loop formation. This approach identified factors that are actively recruited in response to replication stress. In total, 32, 42 and 24 proteins exhibited increased interaction across the three sgRNAs ( Fig. 6A Fig. 6B Table I Fig. 6B Table I Table I 7 7 7 7 Table I 53 , 54 55 56 Table I Fig. 6  CPT-induced expansion of the TUG1 interactome and functional enrichment analysis. 10 P Table I GO analysis of proteins exhibiting increased interaction to TUG1 following CPT treatment  No.  Gene symbol  Protein name  Average peptide abundance across three sgRNAs (×10 7 )  Untreated condition  CPT-treated condition  RNA processing 1 DHX9 DEAH-box helicase 9 5.33 7.18 2 HNRNPA3 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A3 1.75 4.94 3 HNRNPA2B1 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 3.29 3.96 4 DDX5 DEAD-box helicase 5 1.64 3.19 5 HNRNPK Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K 0.24 3.08 6 HNRNPM Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M 2.09 3.04 7 HNRNPU Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U 1.02 3.01 8 RBMX RNA-binding motif protein, X chromosome 1.04 2.79 9 HNRNPA1 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 1.64 1.85 10 HNRNPL Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L 0.77 1.79 11 PSIP1 PC4 and SFRS1-interacting protein 0.91 1.46 12 SRSF1 Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 0.78 1.35 13 DHX15 DEAH-box helicase 15 1.04 1.26 14 NOP58 Nucleolar protein 58 0.82 1.19 15 PTBP1 Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 0.90 1.05 16 RBM14 RNA binding motif protein 14 0.69 1.04 17 HNRNPR Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R 0.26 0.97 18 CDC5L Cell division cycle 5-like protein 0.68 0.72 19 PRPF19 Pre-mRNA-processing factor 19 0.62 0.71 20 SNRNP200 U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 200 kDa helicase 0.24 0.69 21 DDX27 DEAD-box helicase 27 0.34 0.61 22 HNRNPH3 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H3 0.35 0.39  Chromatin organization 1 a H2BC13 Histone H2B type 1-L 0.04 4.91 H2BC18 Histone H2B type 2-F H2BC21 Histone H2B type 2-E H2BK1 Histone H2B type 2-KI 2 a H2AC18 Histone H2A type 3 0.83 3.09 H2AC20 Histone H2A type 2-C H2AC21 Histone H2A type 2-B H2AX Histone H2AX H2AZ2 Histone H2A.V 3 HNRNPU Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U 1.02 3.01 4 MDC1 Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 1.24 1.74 5 H1–2 Histone H1.2 0.28 1.47 6 PSIP1 PC4 and SFRS1-interacting protein 0.91 1.46 7 TOP1 DNA topoisomerase 1 1.22 1.34 8 RBM14 RNA binding motif protein 14 0.69 1.04 9 SUPT16H SPT16 homologue, facilitates chromatin remodelling subunit 0.25 0.88 10 SMARCA5 SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A member 5 0.63 0.84  a  DNA repair 1 PARP1 Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 4.32 5.20 2 TOP2A DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha 4.21 4.40 3 MDC1 Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 1.24 1.74 4 SMARCA5 SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A member 5 0.63 0.84 5 PRPF19 Pre-mRNA-processing factor 19 0.62 0.71 Discussion In this study, we significantly expand our previous findings by identifying a comprehensive interactome of TUG1 under physiological conditions. Our previous study was the first to demonstrate that under replication stress, TUG1 is rapidly upregulated via ATR-CHK1 signalling and interacts with DHX9, playing a crucial role in resolving R-loops formed at replication forks in cancers ( 20 CARPID provided a robust and unbiased approach for profiling lncRNA interactomes, as it enables the capture of transient and condition-specific interactions in living cells. This is particularly advantageous for studying dynamic interactomes under stress conditions, where RNA-protein associations are rapidly remodelled. Recent studies have similarly applied CARPID to map interactions with circular RNA, another class of non-coding RNAs ( 57 59  Figure 3 60 , 61 To highlight the most consistent interactions, we defined a core set of 17 proteins consistently identified across all three sgRNAs under basal conditions, which expanded to 25 proteins following CPT treatment. These proteins may form stable and high-affinity interactions with TUG1 or reside in close spatial proximity, allowing efficient biotinylation from all sgRNA-binding sites within the 10-nm labelling radius of BASU biotin ligase ( 25 7 7 Table I 25 Nonetheless, this approach effectively identified multiple DEAD/DEAH-box RNA helicases as the most prominent TUG1 interactors, particularly under CPT-induced replication stress. Under basal conditions, DHX9, DHX17, DHX18 and DHX21 were consistently identified across all three sgRNAs ( Fig. 4B Fig. 5E Fig. 1B Still, it remains unclear how each helicase is selectively utilized for R-loop resolution in the genome. Given previous reports indicating that lncRNAs often function as molecular scaffolds ( 62 , 63 64 60 , 65 20 Overall, these findings establish TUG1 as a key regulatory component of the cellular response to R-loop accumulation. By dynamically engaging RNA helicases, PARP1, HNRNPs and topoisomerases, TUG1 likely facilitates multiple aspects of R-loop resolution, including their recognition, unwinding and removal, as well as subsequent DNA repair and chromatin remodelling.
