Exposure to these pollutants is a well-established risk factor for cardiorespiratory and systemic diseases. However, limited research exists on common health symptoms experienced by pregnant women cooking in rural Northwest Ethiopia. This study aimed at assessing the common health symptoms experienced during cooking and associated factor among 422 pregnant women in rural Northwest Ethiopia. We collected data on sociodemographic, economic, and cooking practice variables, using both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify associated factors. Among pregnant women using biomass fuel, 338 (82%) reported at least one respiratory symptom (cough, wheezing, shortness of breath), while 312 (74%) experienced at least one non-respiratory symptom (eye irritation, headache, blurred vision) during cooking. Older age (AOR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.59,7.42), large family size (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.37, 3.92), attached kitchens (AOR = 3.40, 95% CI 1.81, 6.38), lack of ventilation (AOR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.46, 4.82), more frequent fire ignition (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI 1.17,7.17) and use of mixed fuel (AOR = 3.52, 95% CI 1.72, 7.20) were associated with self-reported respiratory symptoms. Similarly, large family size (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.06, 2.74), attached kitchen (AOR = 2.62. 95% CI 1.41, 4.89), cooked more than three times per day (AOR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.23, 6.80), lack of ventilation (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.00, 2.78) were associated with self-reported non-respiratory symptoms. This study reveals a high prevalence of respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms among rural Ethiopian pregnant women due to biomass fuel use. Older age, large family size, poor ventilation, and frequent cooking were significantly associated with these symptoms, highlighting the urgent need for interventions to reduce exposure and improve indoor air quality.

Analyzing symptom prevalence and severity allows to quantify disease burden, guide interventions, and evaluate policy effectiveness. While global studies exist, the impact of biomass fuel on pregnant women in Ethiopia, particularly in South Gondar Zone, remains under-researched. This study investigates the self-reported health symptoms of pregnant women while cooking in this region. Methods Study setting This study was conducted in a rural community of the South Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia, approximately 657 km away from Addis Ababa, from November 15 to December 27, 2022. The study area specifically included six kebeles (the smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia) within the Guna-Tana Integrated Field Research and Development Center of Debre Tabor University. This research center was established to integrate education, research, and community service, aligning with the university’s philosophy of extending learning beyond the campus and into the community. According to reports from health extension workers, the total population of the included kebeles is 22,019, comprising 11,186 females and 10,833 males. The study population mirrors many low-income rural communities in Amhara regional state in terms of fuel, stove and meal types. The primary economic activity in the area is farming. Similarly, acute lower respiratory infections including pneumonia, conditions often linked to household air pollution are a major concern in the region. Since industrial activities were absent and the burning of crop residues was not prevalent in the study area, HAP from biomass fuel combustion constituted the predominant and most relevant source of air pollution exposure for the study population within this context. Study design A community based cross-sectional baseline survey was conducted as part of a larger, ongoing randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of the Mirt stove intervention at the Guna-Tana integrated field research and development center (PACTR identifier: ACTR 202111534227089). Though this study is based on the baseline data of the main trial, the primary objective in this specific paper is to assess the magnitude of respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms experienced while cooking or immediately after cooking, and factors associated with those symptoms among biomass fuel user pregnant women prior to any intervention. Study population While many acute respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms can manifest in both pregnant and non-pregnant women, pregnancy introduces unique physiological considerations and potential downstream impacts on maternal and fetal health that warrant specific attention. Our study’s strength lies in its focus on this specific, at-risk group. All pregnant women who met the following inclusion criteria for the stove trial study were included: age 18–38 years, first or second trimester of pregnancy (≤ 24 weeks, determined by self-reported last menstrual period (LMP) and ultrasound), exclusive use of traditional or modified biomass stoves, and primary household cook. Field data collectors, in collaboration with health extension workers and local health development leaders, screened and recruited eligible pregnant women. To minimize confounding effects of maternal age on birth weight (the primary outcome variable of the randomized controlled trial) the study included pregnant women aged 18–38 years, as extreme ages are associated with adverse birth outcomes, thereby enhancing detection of the cook stove intervention’s true effect. But, women with pre-existing chronic respiratory conditions were excluded from this analysis. Sample size A sample size of 422 pregnant women was calculated based on a 95% confidence level, 5% absolute precision, and a projected response rate of 90%, considering that 50.9% of rural women reported respiratory symptoms during cooking in a previous study 12 Context definitions of variables Cooking practice Outcome Asset index Housing condition/characteristics Family size 23 Occupation Educational status Kitchen location Cooking frequency Kitchen ventilation Data collection Face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires were conducted by trained first degree environmental health professionals. The questionnaires were developed after reviewing different literatures 9 24 26 27 Data quality control The principal investigator trained field data collectors and supervisors on research objectives and data collection methods. Data collectors, selected for their familiarity with local culture, conducted a pretest in the study area. This pretest aimed to estimate questionnaire administration time, assess content appropriateness and translation accuracy, and minimize participant distress. Based on pretest feedback, the investigators and data collectors revised the final questionnaire. Data processing and analysis Before statistical analysis, the collected data underwent a thorough cleaning process. This involved checking for completeness, accuracy, and consistency, as well as coding and recoding variables. Missing data were identified during data cleaning and were found to be minimal, with less than 5% missingness across all variables included in the analyses. Given the low rates of missing data, we assumed that data were missing completely at random, making the impact of missingness on our findings negligible. Consequently, we handled missing values by listwise deletion for all analyses. This straightforward approach was deemed appropriate because the small proportion of missing data for variables in our final models was unlikely to significantly bias results or reduce statistical power. Age was categorized primarily to account for potential non-linear relationships between maternal age and the likelihood of experiencing the reported health symptoms. The prevalence of certain symptoms or susceptibility to environmental exposures often does not follow a simple linear pattern across all ages. Simple tabulations and graphical representations were used to gain a preliminary understanding of the data. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the demographic and other characteristics of the study population. Logistic regression analysis was then used to identify potential associations between women’s self-reported respiratory and non-respiratory health symptoms and various socioeconomic and environmental factors, including education, age group, asset index, and cooking and housing characteristics. Participants were presented with a list of both respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms and asked to report their experience while during or after cooking with biomass fuel. Responses for each symptom were recorded as '1' for ‘yes’ (experienced the symptom) and '0' for ‘no’ (did not experience the symptom). A composite score of self-reported symptoms associated with biomass smoke was then calculated by summing these individual symptom responses. This symptom score was checked for normality in its distribution using skewness, kurtosis and Shapiro–Wilk test. In addition, visual inspection of its histogram, Q-Q plot, and box plot was done. Respondents who reported at least one symptom were categorized as ‘yes’ (symptomatic), while those reporting no symptoms were categorized as ‘no’ (asymptomatic). This dichotomized variable was then used as the dependent variable in logistic regression analysis to test the association between various factors and the experience of respiratory and non-respiratory health symptoms. In this analysis, only those characteristics that demonstrated a statistically significant association with the respective dependent variable (either respiratory or non-respiratory symptoms) in the bivariate analysis ( p p Result Descriptive statistics A total of 455 pregnant women were recruited, with 422 (93%) completing the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 28.9 years (SD ± 5.3), and most (63%) were illiterate. All respondents were Amhara and Orthodox Christian, with 96% married. Nearly half 189 (44.8%) were members of womens’ groups including women development group. The average family size was 4.5 ± 1.6 occupant, and 176 (41.7%) had at least one child under five years old. Approximately 142 (33.9%) of respondents were classified as poor based on the asset index (Table 1 Table 1 Socio-demographic Characteristics of pregnant women (N = 422) in South Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia, 2022.

Over half 234 (55.5%) used the same kitchen year-round. Traditional three-stone stoves were the primary cooking method for 344 (81.5%) of participants. Firewood was the most common fuel source 322 (76.3%), followed by cow dung. Fuel use varied seasonally, with firewood and agricultural residues being the primary mix during the dry season and firewood and cow dung during the rainy season and 331 (78.4%) of participants used multiple fuel types per cook. On average, participants lit their stoves three times daily. A majority 341 (80.8%) baked Injera (Ethiopian staple food and flat bread like pancake prepared from a tiny grain called Teff) at least twice weekly (Table 2 Table 2 Cooking practices and fuel use among pregnant women in rural Ethiopia, 2022.

Self-reported non-respiratory health symptom Regarding non-respiratory health symptoms, nearly three-quarters (74%) of participants reported at least one non-respiratory health symptoms during cooking, including headache, blurred vision, and eye irritation. Over half, 167 (53.5%) of participants reported eye irritation as the primary non-respiratory symptom, followed by headaches 147(47%) and blurred vision 97(31%) (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 The magnitude of non-respiratory symptoms among pregnant women cooing with biomass fuel in South Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia, 2022. Regarding the number of symptoms reported by respondents, the study revealed varying levels of symptom experience while cooking with biomass fuel: A total of 134 respondents (31.8%) reported experiencing between one and three symptoms. The largest group, comprising 174 respondents (41.2%), indicated they experienced four to six symptoms. A smaller proportion, 38 respondents (9.0%), reported experiencing seven or more symptoms. Conversely, 76 respondents (18.0%) reported that they did not experience any symptoms while cooking (Fig. 3 Fig. 3 The percentage of respondents by number of symptoms experienced among pregnant women cooing with biomass fuel in South Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia, 2022. Factors associated with self-reported symptoms while cooking Based On the normality test, our data were a little skewed to the right meaning we can’t assume that our data is normally distributed in terms of skewness and kurtosis. Shapiro–Wilk test ( p Women living in households with five and more members were more likely to experience respiratory symptoms compared to households with smaller than five family members (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.37, 3.92). Women aged 32–38 years were more likely to report respiratory symptoms compared to those aged 18–24 years (AOR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.59, 7.42). There was a notable association between reported respiratory symptoms and the use of multiple fuel types, with those experiencing symptoms demonstrating a greater likelihood of multi-fuel use (AOR = 3.52, 95% CI 1.72, 7.20). Participants cooking three or more times daily showed increased likelihood of experiencing symptoms compared to those cooking once a day (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI 1.17,7.17). Additionally, having a kitchen attached to the home (AOR = 3.40, 95% CI 1.81, 6.38) an not opening windows and doors during cooking (AOR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.46, 4.82) were associated with increased likelihood of risk. However, no significant association was found between respiratory symptoms and educational level or socioeconomic status (Table 3 Table 3 Factors associated with self-reported respiratory health symptoms among pregnant during cooking in South Gondar zone, northwest Ethiopia.

Discussion This study assessed the self-reported health symptoms associated with household air pollution from cooking among pregnant women in rural Northwest Ethiopia. Most of the study participants used firewood and cow dung as the primary source of fuel to cook and use separated kitchen from their main households. Similar studies also revealed the same trend 28 32 33 34 37 In this study, greater than four-fifths of participants reported experiencing at least one respiratory symptom, including cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath, while using biomass fuels for cooking. These findings are consistent with studies conducted in rural Honduras and Rajasthan, India 13 38 39 40 41 42 45 Frequent and prolonged exposure to high levels of biomass smoke, particularly during cooking, can lead to a range of non-respiratory health problems 5 28 46 47 48 13 40 49 50 51 52 53 This study found that self-reported health symptoms from biomass smoke exposure were associated with several socioeconomic and cooking-related factors. Specifically, older age, large family size, attached kitchens, lack of ventilation, and frequent fire ignition (three or more times daily) were linked to increased respiratory symptoms. Studies in Ethiopia 12 40 41 54 15 55 56 57 58 59 60 Beyond respiratory symptoms, eye irritation, headaches, and blurred vision were commonly reported non-respiratory issues in this study. Furthermore, large family size, attached kitchen, the high frequency of meals prepared, and lack of ventilation were associated with self-reported non-respiratory symptoms among rural women. The result is aligned with previous studies where cooking with biomass fuels resulted in a greater risk of vision impairment among Chinese older adults 61 62 63 This study, along with previous research, demonstrates that women cooking with biomass fuel and traditional stoves report numerous health complaints. These complaints may indicate both acute and chronic health problems linked to household air pollution from biomass fuel use, as documented in various studies 8 58 64 65 41 66 67 68 69 Limitations Despite its valuable contributions, this study has the following limitations that warrant consideration. First, our reliance on self-reported health symptoms introduces potential for recall bias and subjective interpretation, and without objective clinical validation (spirometry), we couldn’t confirm symptom severity or diagnosis. Additionally, dichotomizing the symptom score, while appropriate for logistic regression due to its non-normal distribution, led to a loss of information on symptom severity or frequency. Second, exposure to biomass fuel was self-reported, rather than objectively measured (PM2.5, carbon monoxide). This means we couldn’t fully capture individual exposure levels influenced by factors like stove type or ventilation. Third, despite adjusting for key confounders identified in bivariate analyses, unmeasured or residual confounding remains a possibility. Finally, our focus was limited to acute, self-reported symptoms during pregnancy, and we didn’t investigate long-term health outcomes like COPD. Future longitudinal research is essential to explore these chronic health consequences in this vulnerable population. Conclusion This study demonstrates a significant prevalence of both respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms among rural women utilizing biomass fuel for cooking in South Gondar Zone. The high rates of reported cough, wheezing, eye irritation, and headaches underscore the substantial health burden associated with household air pollution. Notably, several socioeconomic and cooking-related factors, including older age, large family size, attached kitchens, inadequate ventilation, and frequent fire ignition were significantly associated with these self-reported symptoms. These findings highlight the urgent need for interventions aimed at reducing exposure to biomass smoke and improving indoor air quality in rural Ethiopian households. Addressing these factors through education, improved stove technologies, and promoting alternative energy sources is crucial to mitigating the adverse health effects and enhancing the well-being of rural women and girls.
