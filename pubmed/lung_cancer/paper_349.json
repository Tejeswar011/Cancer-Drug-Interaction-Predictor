Here we investigated DNA methylation as a predictive marker for response of anti-PD-1-based treatment in GC. Methods A total of 99 GC patients treated with first-line anti-PD-1-based treatment were enrolled. In the model construction phase, 30 samples were analyzed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850 K array) and 41 samples using Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing (TBS). Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation (LASSO) were applied to identify differential CpG methylation probes (DMPs). Seven machine learning models were developed, and their performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic and survival analysis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis provided interpretability of the model. In the model validation phase, a temporally independent cohort of 28 samples underwent TBS for external validation. Results The 850 K array identified 523 DMPs, of which 20 were selected as most significant for treatment response. The iMETH model, based on the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, showed optimal predictive value in both training (AUC = 0.99) and testing (AUC = 0.96) sets. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer in responders predicted by iMETH (all log-rank test p n Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that DNA methylation markers can serve as valuable predictors of first-line immunotherapy in GC. The iMETH model, which incorporates 20 DNA methylation CpG probes, effectively predicts patient responses to first-line anti-PD-1-based treatment. This model holds promise for guiding personalized treatment strategies and has the potential for practical application in clinical settings.

By correlating these data with treatment outcomes, we aimed to evaluate the potential of DNA methylation as a biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy. Additionally, we developed and validated a machine learning model based on differential methylation of response-related CpG probes to predict the therapeutic response to first-line anti-PD-1-based treatment in GC, with the goal of facilitating more precise treatment strategies. Methods Patient inclusion and sample acquisition The workflow of this retrospective study is illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Work flow of the study. This diagram illustrates the sequential steps taken in our study. In the CpG feature selection phase, methylation analysis of GC samples was performed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850 K array) and Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing (TBS). Feature selection was conducted using SVM-RFE and LASSO. In the model construction phase, the final predictive model, iMETH, was developed using machine learning algorithms and evaluated for its ability to predict response to first-line anti-PD-1-based treatment. SHAP analysis was then employed to interpret the model. In the model validation phase, a temporally independent cohort of 28 samples underwent TBS for external validation We collected clinical and pathological information, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, tumor location, tumor differentiation grade, clinical TNM (cTNM) stage, treatment regimen, PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS), and MSI status. cTNM staging was based on the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Written informed consent for the collection and analysis of FFPE tissue was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Approval No. [2022]715) and conducted in accordance with the biomedical research guidelines set forth in the Helsinki Declaration. Assessment of treatment response and follow-up Patients underwent baseline abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans prior to the initiation of treatment, with subsequent scans performed every three treatment cycles. Treatment response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) [ 33 Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Genome-wide methylation sequencing was performed to identify CpG probes associated with immunotherapeutic outcomes. Briefly, DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue samples using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The purity and concentration of the extracted DNA were assessed with the Qubit 3.0 fluorometer. Subsequently, 500 ng of DNA from each sample was bisulfite-converted using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, USA). The converted DNA was then applied to Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850 K array) following the manufacturer’s guidelines and protocols provided by Sinotech Genomics Co., Ltd. (Illumina, USA). Data analysis was performed using the “ChAMP” package in R [ 34 β p β 35 36 p http://www.webgestalt.org 37 Targeted bisulfite sequencing and analysis Targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS) was utilized to evaluate the methylation levels of selected DMPs. Bisulfite sequencing primers were designed using MethPrimer. Genomic DNA (1 μg) was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, USA). One-twentieth of the eluted product was employed as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using the KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil + ReadyMix PCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, USA) for 35 cycles. The PCR products from multiple genes within each sample were pooled equally, 5′-phosphorylated, 3′-dA-tailed, and then ligated to barcoded adapters using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, USA). The barcoded libraries from all samples were sequenced on the Illumina platform. Initial quality control of the raw sequencing data was performed using FastQC (v0.11.7). Subsequent processing involved trimming low-quality reads, removing adapters, and filtering out short or unpaired reads using Trimmomatic (v0.36) [ 38 39 Feature selection and construction of the prediction model To reduce the dimensionality of the DMPs and identify the most informative features for predicting treatment response, we employed two machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE)[ 40 41 After obtaining the methylation levels of the selected CpG probes, patients were divided into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 7:3. We then constructed a CpG methylation prediction model for treatment outcomes using seven classical machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Boosted Logistic Regression (LogitBoost), and Cancerclass. Logistic regression was used to construct a linear model as a control. The performance of each machine learning model was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and confusion matrices. The optimal model, termed the iMETH model, was selected based on these evaluations. Additionally, PFS and OS were compared between responders and non-responders as predicted by the iMETH model. Model interpretation To interpret the results produced by the iMETH model, we utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [ 42 43 Temporally independent validation cohort To evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the iMETH model, we retrospectively collected a temporally independent validation cohort of GC patients diagnosed after February 1, 2024. All patients were enrolled at the same center using identical inclusion criteria as the training and testing set. TBS was performed on FFPE tumor tissues to quantify the DNA methylation levels of the 20 CpG probes included in the iMETH model. The model’s ability to predict treatment response in this cohort was assessed using ROC curve analysis. Statistical analyses All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.1.1). Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t 44 p p Results Clinicopathological characteristics of patients In CpG feature discovery and model construction phase, a total of 71 eligible patients were included, with a median follow-up time of 9.1 months. The cohort comprised 18 females (25.4%) and 53 males (74.6%), with a median age of 59 years (range, 31–88 years). Based on cTNM staging, the cohort included 3 patients with stage II, 26 with stage III, and 42 with stage IV GC, with the majority presenting with poorly differentiated tumors (63/71, 88.7%). The median number of anti-PD-1 therapy cycles was 6 (range, 2–18 cycles). The majority of patients (63/71, 88.7%) received the SOX regimen (S-1 + oxaliplatin) as the concurrent chemotherapy, while 5 patients received CapeOx (capecitabine + oxaliplatin), 1 patient with esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer received a paclitaxel + carboplatin regimen, 1 patient received mFOLFOX6, and 1 patient received S-1 + carboplatin. Of the 46 patients who underwent PD-L1 detection, 13 had a CPS of ≥ 5. MSI detection was performed for 51 patients, revealing 4 patients with MSI-H status (Table 1 p Table 1 Clinical information of patients in CpG feature discovery and model construction phase Characteristic N 71 Age [ M 59 (31–88) Gender [ n Male 53 (74.6) Female 18 (25.4) BMI [mean (SD), kg/m 2 22.9 (3.83) Smoking [ n Yes 26 (36.6) No 45 (63.4) Alcohol consumption [ n Yes 14 (19.7) No 57 (80.3) Location [ n Upper 1/3 28 (39.4) Middle 1/3 20 (28.2) Lower 1/3 19 (26.8) Whole 2 (2.8) Remnant 2 (2.8) Tumor invasion [ n T2 4 (5.6) T3 10 (14.1) T4a 47 (66.2) T4b 10 (14.1) Lymph node [ n N0 2 (2.8) N1-3 69 (97.2) Distant metastasis [ n M0 34 (47.9) M1 37 (52.1) cTNM stage [ n Ⅱ 3 (4.2) Ⅲ 26 (36.6) ⅣA 5 (7.0) ⅣB 37 (52.1) Differentiation [ n Well or Moderate 8 (11.3) Poor 63 (88.7) Anti-PD-1 agent [ n Camrelizumab 9 (12.7) Pembrolizumab 2 (2.8) Nivolumab 15 (21.1) Sintilimab 45 (63.4) Received cycles of anti-PD-1 therapy [ M 6 (2–18) Chemotherapy [ n SOX 63 (88.7) CapeOx 5 (7.0) Others 3 (4.2) CPS [ n < 5 33 (46.5) ≥ 5 13 (18.3) NA 25 (35.2) MSI [ n MSI-H 4 (5.6) MSS 47 (66.2) NA 20 (28.2) Follow–up time [ M 9.1 (1.7–26.8) PFS [ M 6.1 (1.7–17.9) OS [ M Not reached (1.7–26.9) M SOX CapeOx Others CPS MSI PFS OS According to RECIST 1.1, no patients achieved a CR at the first assessment; 45 patients (63.4%) achieved a PR, 10 patients (14.1%) had SD (2 patients achieved PR at the second assessment), and 16 patients (22.5%) experienced PD (Fig. 2 2 Fig. 2 Information on anti-PD-1-based treatment in the cohort. a b c d Identification of methylation CpG probes associated with anti-PD-1-based treatment response To identify treatment-related methylation profiles across the whole genome, a cohort of 30 GC patients, comprising 19 responders and 11 non-responders, underwent Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip analysis.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated no batch effects between the TBS data and the 850 K array data, indicating consistency between the two technologies and their suitability for combined analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). Consequently, we acquired the methylation levels of the 20 DMPs from a total of 71 GC samples, as depicted in the heatmap in Fig. 4 Predictive model development The 71 samples were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 7:3. Seven machine learning algorithms were employed to construct prediction models. While four models (LogitBoost, AdaBoost, RF, and Logistic Regression) achieved perfect performance on the training set (AUC = 1.00) with confidence intervals of (1.00 ~ 1.00), indicating a potential risk of overfitting, their performance on the testing set was less impressive (AUC = 0.66 ~ 0.87), underscoring their limited generalizability. In contrast, the KNN model demonstrated superior performance, with AUC values of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96 ~ 1.00) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.85 ~ 1.00) on the training and testing sets, respectively.

Its use has not only improved the pathological response rates but also yielded positive outcomes in overall prognosis [ 45 46 4 In clinical practice, reliable predictive markers are essential to guiding precision therapy. However, in our study cohort, a considerable proportion of patients with CPS < 5 or MSS status still responded to anti-PD-1-based treatment. This indicates that these commonly used predictive biomarkers may not perform as well in the real world, particularly in terms of sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, researchers worldwide are continually exploring novel biomarkers beyond conventional ones, including RNA sequencing biomarkers, immune microenvironment features, deep-learning-based pathology or imaging omics, and epigenetic or metabolomic markers [ 47 51 29 31 52 53 54 55 Studies often involve hundreds or thousands of CpG methylation probes, which may constrain their clinical applicability. Complex classification models, such as those based on deep learning, may suffer from black-box issues, making their results less interpretable. Thus, balancing the number of predictive variables, the model’s discriminative power, and its interpretability is crucial. In our study, we addressed these challenges by employing machine learning algorithms to reduce the feature set to 20 through a rigorous stepwise screening process. Here we developed a TBS chip based on these 20 CpG methylation probes. The low cost and standardization ease of TBS enhance the model’s potential for clinical application. Furthermore, the iMETH model demonstrated robust fitting and generalization performance in both training and validation sets, likely due to the KNN algorithm’s non-parametric nature, which effectively captures subtle differences in methylation data ( β The SHAP algorithm enhanced the interpretability of the model by highlighting the specific contributions of the 20 selected DMPs to the decision-making process, providing valuable insights for future mechanistic studies. For instance, cg06692537, a key feature ranked first in the iMETH model, is located at the TSS200 region of the TMEM229A gene. It is widely acknowledged that high methylation in promoter regions often results in transcriptional repression or even gene silencing [ 56 57 58 59 60 61 63 56 64 Despite these promising findings, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, one major limitation of our study is that none of the DMPs identified remained significant after BH correction, largely due to the limited sample size and high dimensionality of the methylation array data. Although we adopted a relatively stringent threshold for DMP identification, the results should be interpreted with caution. Second, the study’s single-center and retrospective design may introduce selection bias, and the relatively small sample size and short follow-up duration, along with missing clinical and pathological data, may restrict the scope and accuracy of the analysis. Additionally, we only analyzed pre-treatment biopsy samples, excluding tissues collected during or after treatment. This limits our ability to assess how DNA methylation might reflect treatment efficacy over time. Therefore, future studies with larger sample sizes or integrated multi-omics data are warranted to validate these findings and improve statistical robustness. Conclusions In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that DNA methylation markers can serve as valuable predictors of first-line immunotherapy in GC. The iMETH model, which incorporates 20 DNA methylation CpG probes, effectively predicts patient responses to first-line anti-PD-1-based treatment. This model holds promise for guiding personalized treatment strategies and has the potential for practical application in clinical settings.
