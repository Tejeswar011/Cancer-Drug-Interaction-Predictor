Introduction Bladder cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the world and is ranked ninth for incidence rates in 2022, with approximately 614,000 new cases and 220,000 deaths reported. Men are affected more often than women. In men, this type of cancer ranks sixth for incidence (4.6%) and ninth for mortality (3.1%), with tobacco use being the primary risk factor [ 1 2 Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) originates in the cells lining the urinary bladder tract, specifically the urothelial cells. Urothelial carcinomas include a group of neoplasms that affect the bladder, upper urinary tract (kidneys and ureters), and proximal urethra, with UBC accounting for 90–95% of cases [ 3 4 5 Therapeutic approaches differ based on the type of tumor that a patient has. For MIBC, the standard treatment is a radical cystectomy (RC) with the removal of the pelvic lymph nodes [ 6 7 8 9 10 The miR-106b/25 cluster, which includes miR-106b, miR-25, and miR-93, is highly conserved on chromosome 7q22, located in intron 13 of the MCM7 11 12 PTEN 13 Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of miR-25-3p is essential for developing new targeted therapies and diagnostic methods, and for predicting prognoses. Therefore, this study investigated the biological role of miR-25-3p in the pathogenesis of UBC. We created a UBC in vitro model by transfecting an miR-25-3p mimic, its inhibitor, and a control miRNA into the invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma cell line T24. The transfection efficiency was analyzed along with the biological processes in the cancer cells, including the cell viability and death, proliferation, oxidative stress, migration, and changes in gene expression. Additionally, we used multiple bioinformatics tools to investigate the predicted targets of miR-25-3p, the biological pathways they regulated, and the gene expression patterns in TCGA samples with a low and high expression of this miRNA. 2. Results 2.1. In Silico Analysis 2.1.1. Identification of miR-25-3p Target Genes Using miRTarBase, miRecords, and TarBase, 32 genes were identified as validated targets of miR-25-3p through only luciferase assays ( Supplementary Table S1 CDKN1C BCL2L11 MDM2 FBXW7 KAT2B Figure 1 To explore their biological roles, we conducted a protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis using the STRING database, and nodes with isolated connections were excluded, resulting in a network of 22 nodes. The PPI network was visualized using Cytoscape (version 3.10.3) and the cytoHubba plugin, which identified the top 10 proteins using the MCC algorithm ( Figure 2 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses provided insight into the functional roles of the miR-25-3p target genes. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the validated targets of miR-25-3p are mainly enriched in bladder cancer, followed by endometrial cancer and platinum drug resistance ( Figure 2 Figure 2 2.1.2. Increased Expression of miR-25-3p in Bladder Cancer To explore the miRNAs involved in bladder cancer progression, we performed differential expression analyses of miRNAs from “The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)” database using bioinformatics tools. This analysis compared the miR25-3p expression in tumor tissues versus normal tissues in NMIBC ( Figure 3 Figure 3 p p p −9 Supplementary Figure S1 2.2. Functional Assays in Invasive UBC T24 Cells RT-qPCR confirmed the transfection efficiency. After 48 h, the miR-25-3p expression was significantly upregulated (11.16-fold) in the mimic (MI) group compared to the negative control (NC). In the inhibitor (IN) group, miR-25-3p was downregulated (−2.82-fold) ( Figure 4 2.3. Overexpression of miR-25-3p Increases Cell Proliferation and Plays a Role in Cell Viability The MTT assay showed an increased cell proliferation in the MI group, suggesting that the overexpression of miR-25-3p promotes cell proliferation. In contrast, the IN group maintained proliferation levels similar to the NC ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.4. miR-25-3p Modulates the Redox Status Oxidative stress assays were performed to investigate potential cell death pathways, including necroptosis and ferroptosis, given that the morphological analyses revealed features consistent with necrotic cell death (characterized by membrane rupture). The IN group exhibited increased lipid peroxidation, whereas the MI group showed a reduction in this marker ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 2.5. miR-25-3p Modulates T24 Cell Migration The wound healing assay verified the effect of miR-25-3p on T24 cell migration. The results showed that the MI group migrated significantly faster than the NC group, beginning at 12 h and completing wound closure within 24 h ( Figure 7 Figure 7 2.6. Gene Expression Showed That miR-25-3p Modulates Ferroptosis and MMPs Pathways We validated the expression of six predicted miR-25-3p target genes— TP53 AIFM1 NFE2L2 TRFC ACSL4 SLC7A11 Figure 8 GPX4 MMP9 MMP11 SLC3A2 Given the increased proliferation and viability observed in the functional assays, we examined the role of miR-25-3p in ferroptosis-related pathways. Ferroptotic cell death aligns with membrane disruption (linked to the necrotic shape seen in the cell death test) and a redox imbalance (shown by oxidative stress markers and NEF2L2 TFRC ACSL4 SLC7A11 Figure 8 SLC3A2 Table S2 SLC3A2 Figure 8 GPX4 Figure 8 In addition, we examined the antimigratory effects by analyzing the modulation of metalloproteinase (MMP) gene expression, specifically MMP9 MMP11 Figure 9 MMP11 3. Discussion Recently, several studies have identified the important role of miR-25-3p in various cancers; however, the specific role of this miRNA in UBC and its associated mechanisms remain unclear. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the predicted target genes for miR-25-3p highlighted key pathways related to bladder cancer and platinum resistance, emphasizing the importance of this miRNA in the context of UBC. GO demonstrated its essential role in cancer-related cellular pathways, including cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, and oxidative stress. After transfecting UBC T24 cells, the overexpression of miR-25-3p increased cell proliferation, viability, and migration, and it regulated ferroptosis by modulating the redox status and causing oxidative stress. In contrast, downregulating miR-25-3p suppressed cell migration and elevated the antioxidant enzymatic levels. Differential miRNA expression can be considered a hallmark of tumorigenesis and has attracted extensive research interest due to its potential as a cancer biomarker and therapeutic target [ 14 The increase in cell proliferation observed in the MTT assay in the MI group is similar to the results seen in different cancers with the overexpression of miR-25-3p, such as cholangiocarcinoma [ 15 16 17 18 Although studies on miR-25-3p in the context of oxidative stress and tumor progression are limited, this study provides valuable insights into its regulatory role in antioxidant pathways during tumor development. The results indicate that miR-25-3p overexpression may suppress CAT and SOD activity. Additionally, a decrease in TBARS levels, along with the reduction in reduced glutathione (GSH) and the increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG), suggests that the consumption of GSH and its conversion to GSSG reflect an antioxidant response to neutralize reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the decrease in GSH levels combined with increased GST activity suggests a possible chemoresistance mechanism via enhanced drug efflux [ 19 20 21 The modulation of miR-25-3p expression also affected the cellular migratory capacity. The migration and invasion of tumor cells through the extracellular matrix are related to multiple biochemical and morphological changes during the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes cancer progression and metastasis [ 22 23 24 25 13 26 27 28 29 30 mir-25-3p has several target genes related to the regulation of cell proliferation, death, and migration. TP53 31 32 AIFM1 33 34 35 We identified several genes as predicted targets of miR-25-3p through an in silico analysis using the miRTarBase, miRecords, and TarBase databases. Although the downregulation of NFE2L2 36 TFRC 37 ACSL4 38 SLC7A11 SLC3A2 39 GPX4 To better understand ferroptosis, a bioinformatics analysis was performed using TCGA-BLCA samples to identify potential mRNAs linked to ferroptosis and increased miR-25-3p expression (see Table S2 SLC7A10 40 We evaluated the increase in MMP expression, previously reported in the literature, as a possible pathway modulated by miR-25-3p [ 41 MMP9 MMP11 MMP9 42 MMP11 43 44 Our results, obtained by downregulating the TP53 45 46 Furthermore, the expression of MMP9 MMP11 47 48 SMAD7 49 SMAD7 SMAD7 MMP9 MMP11, MMP11 SMAD7 To integrate our findings, we present a concluding schematic ( Figure 10 GPX4 TFRC ACSL4 SLC7A11/SLC3A2 SLC7A10 Our results are pioneering in suggesting the role of mR-25-3p in the modulation of ferroptosis in T24 cells cultured in vitro. However, the present study has some limitations, which were not the objective of this manuscript, but that may guide future research on miR-25-3p in the context of UBC, including the following: (i) the use of a single bladder cancer cell line, which limits the generalizability of the findings; (ii) the need for more comprehensive analyses employing high-throughput approaches; (iii) validation through in vivo assays using animal models, such as xenograft tumors; and (iv) an assessment of the miR-25-3p levels in liquid biopsies from UBC patients. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Bioinformatic Analysis The STRING online database generated protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks [ 50 51 https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ 4.1.1. Selection of Putative Targets Regulated by miR-25-3p Computational predictions of the miR-25-3p target genes were evaluated using miRTarBase, miRecords, and TarBase. These three databases collectively identified 1524 genes with binding sequences for the miR-25-3p seed region. Of these, 32 targets have been experimentally validated through luciferase reporter assays ( Supplementary Table S1 4.1.2. Survival Analysis To evaluate the impact of the differential expression of miR-25-3p target genes on patient survival, data for the miR-25-3p expression were retrieved from TCGA using the Bioconductor package. Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curves were generated in R to illustrate the relationship between the gene expression and patient outcomes. Bladder cancer patients were stratified into high- and low-expression groups based on their median miRNA levels, and statistical significance was determined using the log-rank test. We collected the data on 4 February 2025, and archived all the analysis outputs and R scripts for future studies. 4.1.3. Analysis of miRNA–mRNA Association of Ferroptosis-Related Genes The association between miR-25-3p and the expression of ferroptosis-related genes was investigated using the approach described by Jacobsen et al. [ 52 cis 2 2 2 2 2 p 4.2. Cell Line and Cultivation Conditions The T24 cell line (ATCC ® 2 Figure S1 ® Supplementary Figure S2 4.3. Transfection of T24 Cells with miR-25-3p, miRNA Extraction, and RT-qPCR T24 cells were transfected with the following miR-25-3p oligonucleotides: mirVana ® ® 2 53 Small-RNA extraction was performed using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (217004, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA concentration and purity were measured with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). For expression profiling, 1.4 ng of miRNA was used for reverse transcription. For cDNA synthesis, the miRNA was reverse-transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was diluted by 1:4 ( v v 4.4. Preparation of Monolayer Cell Culture (2D) All the assays, except for cell migration, were performed in 96-well plates with 1 × 10 4 4.5. MTT Assay Cell proliferation was measured using FBS in the MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoline bromide) (cat. No M6494; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Eugene, OR, USA), and following the method described by Mosman et al. [ 54 4.6. Morphological Assay (Triple Staining) for Cell Death Assessment A cell death analysis was performed using the triple staining method [ 55 4.7. Wound Healing (Scratch Assay) The wound healing assay was performed in 24-well plates with 1.1 × 10 5 ® Wound_healing_size_tool 56 4.8. Oxidative Stress Protein quantification was conducted using the Bradford method [ 57 4.8.1. Quantification of TBARS The thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) method was employed to investigate whether miR-25-3p contributes to lipid peroxidation. For this purpose, 50 μL of each sample from the NC, IN, and MI groups were pipetted into a 96-well plate, followed by the addition of 5 μL of FeCl3, 5 μL of ascorbic acid, 50 μL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and 50 μL of thiobarbituric acid (TBA), and left in a water bath at 90 °C for 15 min. After this time, the reaction was stopped by placing the plate on an ice surface. The measurement was performed at λ λ 58 4.8.2. Assessment of GT, GSH, and GSSG Concentrations The quantification of the total glutathione (GT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) was performed according to Rahman et al. [ 59 λ λ 60 4.8.3. GST Activity The activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was measured with the addition of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and a potassium phosphate buffer. The absorbance of the samples was measured at λ 61 4.8.4. CAT Activity The enzymatic activity of catalase (CAT) was determined by measuring the degradation of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of oxygen and water. After selecting the protein concentration (normalized to 1.0 mg/mL in PBS), 297 μL of the reaction medium was added to a UV–vis microplate, and the absorbance was measured at λ 62 4.8.5. SOD Activity The determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity consisted of the quantification of the complex formed between the superoxide anions by the addition of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH·HCl). The samples were exposed for 2 min to a reaction mixture containing sodium carbonate buffer (50 mM, pH of 10.2), NBT (96 µM), and Triton X-100 (0.6%) with 20 mM NH2OH·HCl. This reaction led to the formation of a yellow coloration and the reduction of NBT, resulting in a blue coloration at λ 63 4.9. Gene Expression Analysis After 48h of transfection, the total RNA was extracted using the PureLink ® TP53 AIFM1 NFE2L2 SLC7A11 TRFC ACSL4 MMP9 MMP11 GPX4 Table S3 -ΔΔCt 64 β-actin 4.10. Statistical Analysis Statistical tests were conducted on three biological replicates, with at least three technical replicates for each condition. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the data distribution. If the data followed a normal distribution, comparisons were made using an ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences in gene expression were analyzed using Student’s t-test to compare the mean relative expression (2 −ΔΔCt p p p p 5. Conclusions Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-25-3p plays a functional role in modulating key features of T24 bladder cancer cells, including cell proliferation, migration, oxidative stress, and viability, by regulating gene expression. The overexpression of miR-25-3p promotes a more aggressive cellular phenotype.

The overexpression of miR-25-3p (mimic) led to the inhibition of CAT and SOD activities, resulting in an initial accumulation of ROS. However, the decrease in GSH and increase in GSSG indicate a compensatory mechanism via the activation of GPX4, which contributes to the reduction in TBARS levels. In addition, the downregulation of TFRC and ACSL4 may further decrease lipid peroxidation. The downregulation of SLC7A11 and SLC3A2 suggests an alternative compensatory pathway for GPX4 activation, through direct cysteine import mediated by SLC7A10. Moreover, miR-25-3p enhanced the cell migratory capacity through the upregulation of MMP9 and MMP11, and promoted proliferation and viability via the downregulation of TP53 and AIFM1. Conversely, the inhibition of miR-25-3p (inhibitor) increased the TBARS concentrations, despite higher levels of CAT and SOD activities, leading to cell death with necrotic morphology (ferroptosis), as evidenced by the propidium iodide uptake. The inhibitor treatment also decreased the migratory capacity of T24 cells through the downregulation of MMP11. ",
