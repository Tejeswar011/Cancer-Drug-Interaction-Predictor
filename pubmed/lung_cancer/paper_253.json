To prevent such issues, research on wearable robots aimed at improving gait has been actively pursued. Among them, exoskeleton robots, a widely used approach, require an accurate understanding of the user’s gait cycle for effective control. Various studies have explored gait cycle detection and prediction methods depending on the type of gait robot platform and the use of sensors. However, a major challenge in gait cycle prediction algorithms remains the issue of nonlinear predictive trajectories. In the study, a robotic hip exoskeleton (RHE) was utilized to implement an enhanced gait phase estimation (GPE) algorithm integrated with a muscle support system. Participants were divided into two groups (Group A and Group B) based on their initial gait performance, and the effectiveness of gait rehabilitation training was evaluated. The results showed that in the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), walking time decreased by approximately 5% in Group A and 27% in Group B. In the 6-minute walk test (6MinWT), walking distance increased by approximately 1% in Group A and 14% in Group B. Group B, which had lower initial gait performance, showed a greater gait performance improvement rate compared to Group A, which had higher initial gait performance. Through the gait performance results of the two groups, the applicability of the GPE based muscle support algorithm was confirmed.

In particular, research on various wearable robots aims to enhance the walking performance of users. Wearable lower limb robots can be broadly classified into exoskeleton robots 4 8 9 12 13 17 18 19 20 22 Research on gait cycle prediction is a crucial factor in maximizing the performance of lower limb wearable robots, as it supports natural walking for users and enhances safety 23 25 26 28 29 30 31 32 33 Figure 1 Overview the clinical trials of GPE-based muscle support algorithm for RHE; ( a b c d In the study, a GPE-based muscle support algorithm, optimized for embedded and portable environments, is applied to a robotic hip exoskeleton (RHE) to compare gait support performance between two groups: elderly individuals with sarcopenia and patients with brain lesions. The gait rehabilitation system consists of a robotic hip exoskeleton (RHE), a lift device, insole sensors, and a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor. The training protocol comprises two standard gait rehabilitation tests: the 10-meter walk test (10MWT) and the 6-minute walk test (6MinWT). In the 10MWT, walking time, cadence, and speed are measured, while in the 6MinWT, walking distance, cadence, and speed are assessed (Fig. 1 1 1 Typically, walking rehabilitation outcomes are assessed using metrics such as time or velocity in the 10MWT, and distance in the 6MWT 34 35 The optimized torque profile is generated based on predicted gait trajectories produced by the GPE algorithm, which adapts to the user’s gait cycle (Fig. 1 The RHE with a GPE-based muscle support algorithm aims to evaluate its applicability for individuals who are capable of walking. Therefore, the hypotheses of the study are as follows: (1) When gait rehabilitation training is performed while wearing the RHE, walking time in the 10MWT decreases, and walking distance in the 6MinWT increases, resulting in a significant improvement in gait performance. (2) Among the individuals wearing the RHE, those with lower initial gait performance (e.g., lower walking speed in 10MWT and shorter walking distance in 6MinWT) exhibit a relatively greater improvement in walking speed and walking distance after gait rehabilitation training compared to those with higher initial gait performance. The contributions of the study can be summarized as follows: Development of a GPE-based muscle support algorithm : To address the issue of nonlinearity in gait cycle prediction, an enhanced GPE algorithm was applied to provide improved muscle support. Implementation of a personalized torque control system : PPG sensor feedback was utilized to enable optimized muscle support tailored to individual users. Validation through clinical trials : A six-day clinical trial was conducted with elderly individuals and patients with brain lesions, demonstrating significant gait improvements in 10MWT and 6MinWT evaluations. Applicability to various exoskeleton robot platforms : The proposed method was shown to be applicable not only to the RHE platform but also to various lower-limb rehabilitation exoskeleton robots.

However, with the robotic device (RHE), both 10MWT and 6MinWT showed statistically significant improvements. In other words, when walking without the robotic device, there was little difference in pre-test and post-test results for 10MWT and 6MinWT. However, when using the robotic device, a significant difference was observed, indicating that the participants successfully adapted to robotic gait training. Group B consisted of individuals with brain lesions, where 10MWT in the No RHE condition showed statistically significant improvements, and both 10MWT and 6MinWT in the RHE condition demonstrated statistically significant results. This indicates that, even without the robotic device, 10MWT showed a noticeable difference between pre-test and post-test. Additionally, when using the robotic device, significant differences were observed in both 10MWT and 6MinWT, confirming the effectiveness of robotic-assisted gait training. When comparing the results of the two groups, it was observed that participants generally adapted well to robotic gait training. Additionally, individuals with greater walking difficulties (Group B) showed a higher rate of improvement in both gait rehabilitation effectiveness without RHE (No RHE) and the robot-assisted training effect (RHE). Furthermore, in the No RHE condition, even though the pre-test and post-test results were not statistically significant, the substantial difference in the improvement rate suggests a clinically meaningful change. These findings align with the initial hypotheses: (1) When gait rehabilitation training is performed while wearing the RHE, walking time in the 10MWT decreases, and walking distance in the 6MinWT increases, resulting in a significant improvement in gait performance. (2) Among the individuals wearing the RHE, those with lower initial gait performance (e.g., lower walking speed in 10MWT and shorter walking distance in 6MinWT) exhibit a relatively greater improvement in walking speed and walking distance after gait rehabilitation training compared to those with higher initial gait performance. It was observed that the pre-test and post-test results with RHE showed lower performance compared to the pre-test and post-test results without RHE (No RHE). The primary reason for this appears to be the relatively heavy weight of the robot, which may have caused psychological discomfort for the users during walking. Additionally, environmental factors such as the short six-day clinical trial period and the consecutive training schedule may have contributed to this result by providing insufficient time for users to adapt to the robot or leading to accumulated fatigue. The recruited participants included elderly individuals and patients with brain lesions, with a variety of conditions; however, they were generally selected based on having gait impairments. The study provided useful insights into the trend that individuals with greater walking difficulties benefit more from robot-assisted gait rehabilitation training. However, it was observed that the standard deviation value of the gait rehabilitation training results was relatively large. This is likely due to the diversity of lesions among the participants in the study. In future studies, if participants are recruited with more uniform lesion types, the range of standard deviation values of gait rehabilitation training results is expected to decrease. The participants in the clinical trial underwent gait rehabilitation training using a lift and RHE over a six-day period and successfully completed the training without any safety incidents. When performing gait rehabilitation training while being suspended by the lift and wearing the RHE, participants were able to walk naturally in straight-line distances. However, at turning points, the lift was perceived as an obstacle, causing stiffness and psychological discomfort in the trainees. The lift system was generally effective in ensuring safety during gait rehabilitation training, except for certain sections. Since the rehabilitation training gait data collected during the clinical trial included turning points, the reliability of the data was somewhat low but still helpful in identifying trends. Resolving these issues to some extent is expected to enhance the reliability of gait rehabilitation training data in future studies. The low-pass filter-applied GPE algorithm was found to be effective in compensating for nonlinearity issues in gait prediction. Additionally, it was confirmed that the GPE algorithm is useful as an indicator for distinguishing the beginning and end of gait cycles. However, the predictive trajectory of the GPE algorithm is expected to be influenced by the gait performance of individuals wearing the RHE robot, determining whether it appears linear or nonlinear. In particular, the more non-linear the predictive trajectory, the greater the likelihood that the timing of the assistive force in the applied strength-support algorithm will be misaligned. This misalignment may result in counterproductive forces for the wearer, which can interfere with their movement. To address this issue, it is necessary to implement a personalized phase portrait technique, adjusting the trajectory from an elliptical shape to a more circular form. Future research aims to integrate deep learning technology into the low-pass filter-enhanced GPE algorithm to generate personalized phase portraits, thereby further improving the algorithm’s performance. Moreover, this study has demonstrated the potential application of the GPE algorithm not only for elderly individuals wearing the RHE but also for patients with brain lesions and other lower-limb disabilities. The torque profile provided by the robot was adjusted in real-time and applied to the user. In general, minimal torque assistance was provided to individuals with slower walking speeds or weaker muscle strength, while higher levels of muscle support were offered to those with faster walking speeds and more developed muscle strength. Additionally, a counter-based muscle support algorithm was implemented, where flexion torque was applied to one side while simultaneously providing extension torque to the opposite side. Among the RHE users with good walking performance, adaptation to this support method was relatively quick. However, for users with poor walking performance, PPG sensor monitoring revealed a rapid change in heart rate, indicating potential discomfort or strain. Based on these findings, the intensity of muscle support was adjusted accordingly during gait training. In the future, we aim to develop a system that incorporates real-time feedback from physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) to automatically tune the muscle support algorithm, ultimately providing a personalized torque profile for each user. Through the clinical trial results of the study, we compared gait performance under No RHE and RHE conditions and confirmed that the rate of gait performance improvement varied depending on the participants’ initial walking ability after undergoing gait rehabilitation training with RHE. Additionally, the study demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the GPE based muscle support algorithm. In the future, we plan to conduct feasibility study of robotic gait rehabilitation clinical trials by applying the GPE algorithm-based muscle support system to various exoskeleton robot platforms, including a lightweight RHE platform and a full-body exoskeleton robot platform.

On Day 1, primary and secondary endpoints are conducted. From Day 2, the pre-test is conducted, which included both unassisted gait rehabilitation training (No RHE) and robot-assisted gait rehabilitation training (RHE). From Days 3 to 6, gait rehabilitation training is performed exclusively using RHE. On Day 7, the post-test is conducted, including both unassisted gait rehabilitation training (No RHE) and robot-assisted gait rehabilitation training (RHE), along with assessments of primary and secondary endpoints. To prevent fall-related accidents during gait training, all participants wear a safety lift system while gait.

Symmetry, which reflects the left-right balance during walking, is utilized as a measure for evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation. Cadence, based on walking rhythm and the number of steps per minute, is used to assess the degree of functional recovery. Speed, an indicator of overall gait efficiency, serves as a key criterion for verifying the effectiveness of robot-assisted rehabilitation training. The product was verified as a user-friendly gait analysis tool by comparing its performance with the Vicon system, a motion analysis system 39 Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor The photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor (Polar OH1, Polar Electro Oy, Finland) is a healthcare device that utilizes light to record changes in the area where arteries pass (as shown in Fig. 6 In the study, the device is connected to a PC via Bluetooth and is used for real-time monitoring. It can store up to 200 hours of training data and supports continuous operation for up to 12 hours on a single charge.

Additionally, the phase portrait represented based on angle and angular velocity data exhibits an elliptical shape, which impacts the results of the GPE algorithm. To address the issues, the noise in the angle and angular velocity data is reduced using the following Eq.

The angle and angular velocity of the encoder are used to determine the starting and ending points of muscle support. At the stage when muscle support begins, the gait cycle is predicted through the GPE algorithm, and the muscle support of the hip joint is assisted according to the cycle and amplitude of the torque profile established based on the GPE algorithm. At the point when muscle support ends, the support timing of friction compensation and GPE algorithm is turned off.  Algorithm 1 STOP and GO algorithm Gait phase estimation (GPE) algorithm Heel strike corresponds to the 0% point in the gait cycle and is a crucial indicator of the start of walking. Identifying the starting point of walking facilitates the setup of robot control. From the perspective of gait kinematics, maximum hip flexion or extension is sometimes considered the initial gait event 23 43 44 2 5 8 2

Since the data is assumed to follow a normal distribution, a paired t-test is performed. This test is used to calculate the mean difference between the two datasets and evaluate whether the difference is statistically significant. Furthermore, a one-tailed test examines whether one condition was greater or less.
