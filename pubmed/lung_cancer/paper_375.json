This report describes the novel application of single-fraction adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for a 66-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma for whom a conventional RT workflow was impractical due to advanced Parkinson’s disease with uncontrolled tremors. Case presentation The patient presented with a 2.4 cm spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe (LUL) diagnosed as stage 1A3 lung adenocarcinoma. She declined surgery, and local radiation oncologists deemed SBRT unsafe due to her tremors. Our team proposed a direct-to-unit, single-visit SBRT treatment utilizing anesthesia for immobilization and the Ethos platform for online adaptation to day-of-treatment positioning. An initial treatment plan was generated offline using a diagnostic CT acquired near the patient’s home. On the treatment day the patient was anesthetized and a custom foam mold created using a diagnostic CT was used for setup. An internal gross tumor volume (iGTV) was adjusted based on the CBCT of the treatment day. An adaptive plan improved target coverage by 5% without violating organ-at-risk constraints. The entire procedure from initial CBCT to treatment completion took 63 min. Post-treatment recalculations on a CBCT confirmed dosimetric accuracy. Conclusions This case illustrates the feasibility of direct-to-unit single-fraction CT-guided ART with high-quality CBCT imaging and anesthesia-facilitated immobilization. Our successful completion of this treatment establishes a procedure for future direct-to-unit ART in lung cancer, enhancing accessibility and reducing treatment time for a patient population for whom conventional RT is impractical.

Most applications of ART rely on underlying CT imaging, typically acquired during a dedicated simulation session [ 1 3 4 5 9 In this brief report, we describe a single-fraction adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment of a lung adenocarcinoma for a woman for whom conventional RT workflows were not practical. Case presentation A 66-year-old female presented to her primary care provider with a chief complaint of unintentional 35-pound weight loss. She had a medical history inclusive of advanced Parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa 25–250 mg thrice per day and a 47-pack year smoking history. Her weight loss workup included a chest x-ray, which visualized a hazy left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrate. A subsequent diagnostic CT scan characterized the infiltrate as a peripherally located 2.4 cm spiculated nodule. A CT-guided biopsy successfully sampled adenocarcinoma. An 18-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scan identified mild tracer avidity in the LUL lesion (maximum standardized uptake value of 2.5) without evidence of disease elsewhere. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not identify intracranial metastatic disease. She was diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition cT1cN0M0 stage 1A3 lung adenocarcinoma. Her pulmonary function tests were within normal limits, and a cardiothoracic surgeon assessed that she could be a candidate for surgery, but she elected against surgery. Local radiation oncologists indicated she could not be safely treated with SBRT due to her Parkinsonian tremors. She consulted our service for a second opinion, and we likewise observed that she could not voluntarily control her tremors long enough to receive RT. However, we discussed definitive SBRT to the LUL adenocarcinoma delivered as 34 Gy in a single fraction with anesthesia services to facilitate immobilization. Moreover, because the patient lived many hours from our institution, we conceived a direct-to-unit, single-visit RT course wherein an initial beam arrangement would be drafted on a recent diagnostic CT and adapted at treatment using the Ethos platform (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). On the day of treatment, conscious sedation and paralysis with propofol and rocuronium were induced, and online adaptation began. Direct-to-unit workflow Diagnostic-scan based pre-planning Figure 1 2 3 2 An initial “reference plan” was generated based on the diagnostic CT. Custom rule-based structures were created to limit dose spill into mediastinal anatomy and ensure a centralized hot spot in the iGTV with rapid dose fall-off. An automatic normalization of the plan to meet priority 1 goals for OARs was implemented in the optimization. In the other words, the treatment planning system always normalized to meet the P1 objectives after optimization, if necessary. No normalization was applied based on target coverage criteria. The objectives and dose constraints for OARs and targets that were used in the optimization are shown in Table 1  Table 1 Plan objectives for OARs and target for the reference plan (calculated on diagnostic CT), scheduled and adapted plans (calculated on deformed diagnostic CT), and the treated adapted plan re-calculated on 60-second thorax CBCT Plans OARs Target Coverage Chestwall-iGTV Bronchial Tree Heart Esophagus Great Vessels Lungs-iGTV PTV iGTV Objectives V35.70 Gy < 0.03 cc D4 cc < 17.40 Gy D15cc < 16.0 Gy D5cc < 11.90 Gy D10cc < 31.0 Gy V8.0 Gy < 37% V34 Gy > 90% D95% >34 Gy Reference plan 0.00 cc 7.28 Gy 9.05 Gy 0.87 Gy 6.6 Gy 8.2% 84.7% 36.2 Gy Scheduled plan 0.02 cc 7.38 Gy 9.48 Gy 0.59 Gy 8.14 Gy 8.2% 83.5% 36.0 Gy Adaptive plan 0.00 cc 7.62 Gy 8.90 Gy 0.73 Gy 7.65 Gy 8.2% 88.6% 36.6 Gy Adaptive plan on 60-second CBCT 0.00 cc 7.37 Gy 8.88 Gy 0.82 Gy 7.72 Gy 8.5% 88.4% 37.2 Gy Online adaptive treatment planning & delivery The patient was positioned on the treatment table in the foam mold under anesthesia. A 60- second CBCT acquisition was performed through the lungs. The iGTV contour, which was initially defined on diagnostic CT imaging for creating an initial plan, was rigidly aligned to the lesion as visualized on the CBCT. The attending radiation oncologist manually adjusted the iGTV contour on the CBCT to conservatively contain the apparent motion envelope. As a 60-second CBCT captures all breathing phases, the envelope of the moving GTV (iGTV)– including blurry boundaries– was assumed to estimate the internal target volume (ITV). Given the patient’s regular and controlled breathing with rate of 14 breaths per minute while under anesthesia and limited motion for this tumor in the upper lobe, we were confident in the delineation of iGTV as an estimate of ITV. For a quantitative comparison of target delineation on initial plan (diagnostic scan) and adaptive plan (CBCT), the iGTV volumes were 7.2 cc and 7.9 cc for diagnostic CT and treatment CBCT, respectively, with 0.1 cm shift in their center of mass. After contouring, a reference plan was calculated on the patient’s anatomy-of-the-day and deemed the “scheduled plan.” Next, the Ethos treatment planning system (TPS) re-optimized the plan considering the patient’s anatomy and generated an adapted plan. Optimization was completed in five and a half minutes. The constraints and target coverage metrics for the scheduled and adapted plans are shown in Table 1 A pre-treatment 60-second CBCT was acquired for final alignment. Verification CBCTs were acquired after each delivered field. The time from initial CBCT to treatment completion was 63 minutes. Subsequently the adapted plan was imported to Eclipse and re-calculated on the CBCT. Figure 4 Discussion and conclusions The direct-to-unit, single-visit ART workflow presented in this report made curative RT possible and convenient for a patient with early-stage lung cancer and advanced Parkinson’s disease who may not otherwise have been treated. As clinical experience with direct-to-unit RT grows, innovative treatment paradigms may increase convenience and enable access to patient population who are presently underserved [ 10 12 Further studies are needed to characterize the unique challenges of online adaptive RT. For example, in this patient’s treatment the PTV coverage was slightly lower than our goal of V34Gy ≥ 90%. We considered this to be clinically acceptable because coverage reduction predominately occurred in the superior and inferior PTV portions, and we had planned treatment with a generous 8 mm craniocaudal PTV expansion. Furthermore, the workflow presented in this report required a pre-treatment diagnostic CT to create a sCT and generate a reference plan, yet future iterations of this adaptive workflow might allow for plan origination directly on a CBCT. This could further simplify the steps in direct-to-unit treatment and increase confidence in dosimetric accuracy. We invite future in-silico and prospective studies to more firmly establish optimal adaptive workflows and the patient populations that they serve. Here we present a unique case of direct-to-unit, single-visit, curative-intent ART leveraging Ethos online adaptation and a high quality CBCT imager with more reliable HU assignations for improved dosimetric accuracy. This experience illustrates feasibility and invites future direct-to-unit single-fraction ART studies.
