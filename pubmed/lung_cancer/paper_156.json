We conducted this study to evaluate the PIF during an exacerbation, its variability, and predictors of suboptimal PIF. Material and Methods: A prospective study that included patients admitted for COPD exacerbation. Clinical, demographic, and functional variables were recorded. Using the In-Check DIAL G16 ® Results: A total of 137 patients were included; 27% were women and the mean age was 69.4 ± 9.8 years. Moreover, 30.8% of the participants with dry powder inhalers had a suboptimal PIF at admission and it was independently associated with female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 8.635; 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.007, 37.152]; p p p Conclusion: One third of COPD patients admitted with a severe exacerbation had a suboptimal PIF, being female sex and lower FEV1 independent predictors. PIF-nr improved progressively after the exacerbation.
