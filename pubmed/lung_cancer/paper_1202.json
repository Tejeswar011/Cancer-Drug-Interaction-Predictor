Recent research indicates that chaya leaf may help to regulate glucose, enhance insulin secretion, and reduce related complications, primarily due to the presence of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and flavonoids. These compounds are believed to enhance insulin sensitivity and offer protection against oxidative stress, a key contributor to diabetes-related complications. Chaya extracts, particularly methanolic and aqueous forms, have shown anti-diabetic effects in animal models, lowering blood glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides and reducing inflammation; their bioactive compounds, like quercetin, rutin, and ferulic acid, may enhance the insulin response, reduce inflammation, and improve antioxidant activity. Some studies warn of potential interactions with metformin. This review compiles findings from the past five years, drawing from databases such as PubMed, SciELO, ScienceDirect, Dialnet, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. It highlights chaya’s phytochemical profile, explores proposed anti-diabetic mechanisms, and summarizes evidence from in vivo, in vitro, and clinical studies. The results indicate that adding chaya leaf to the diet may help people with diabetes as a complementary therapy to conventional treatment; nonetheless, further clinical studies are required to comprehend the exact mechanisms and define specific usage instructions. Further investigation into the specific types of compounds present in chaya, their effective dosages, and their safety in human populations is essential to support its integration into medical practice. chaya leaf diabetes hypoglycemic effects traditional medicine This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction There is rising interest in investigating and recognizing sources like medicinal plants that have important phytochemicals and superior nutritional content compared to processed foods [ 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Cnidoscolus chayamansa Cnidoscolus aconitifolius 2. Botanical and Ethnobotanical Information of C. chayamansa The plant known as chaya is also recognized by the names Cnidoscolus chayamansa Cnidoscolus aconitifolius 12 15 16 Euphorbiaceae Cnidoscolus Figure 1 12 15 16 17 The chaya plant, or Cnidoscolus chayamansa Cnidoscolus aconitifolius C. chayamansa C. aconitifolius 12 15 18 Throughout history, animals like livestock and horses have been given chaya as a food source. Historical records from the Maya civilization indicate that it was also consumed by humans due to its nutritional value [ 16 12 19 16 20 Preparing teas or infusions from the leaves is a common tradition in managing diabetes mellitus. In addition, the stems and roots can be utilized to brew infusions [ 12 Traditionally, chaya infusions were produced using water as a solvent. However, it was noted that some compounds were not fully extracted with water alone; therefore, other solvents, such as methanol and ethanol—and, in some cases, acetone—were used to improve the extraction efficiency. Studies have primarily examined the impacts of solvent extracts of chaya leaves, with findings showing that adding chaya leaves to the diets of rats had the effect of protecting the brain by reducing acetylcholinesterase levels, according to one study [ 21 22 19 11 Moreover, umami plays a role in developing food products by offering a rich and savory taste that improves overall food appeal. This characteristic flavor is primarily due to the presence of free amino acids, such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid, as well as 5′-nucleotides, such as 5′-AMP and 5′-GMP, along with 5′-inosine monophosphate. A research study has pinpointed acids, 5′-AMP, and short peptides as the umami components found in chaya leaves. Additionally, besides their umami flavor, chaya leaves are recognized for their medicinal properties, offering benefits for conditions such as diabetes and rheumatism, as well as gastrointestinal disorders and inflammation [ 23 3. Phytochemistry of the Species Cnidoscolus From a chemical perspective, the leaves and stems of this species have been identified to contain proteins and vitamins such as thiamine, niacin, riboflavin, retinol, beta-carotene, and ascorbic acid. It also contains minerals like calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, sodium, manganese, zinc, and copper. Due to the presence of essential amino acids, the species is considered to have high nutritional value (the essential amino acids present in chaya are building blocks for protein synthesis in the body). Proteins are essential for the growth and repair of tissues, including muscles, skin, and organs [ 23 The leaves contain essential oils and fatty acids like palmitic, oleic, stearic, myristic, arachidonic, and lauric acids, as well as flavones, including quercetin and kaempferol, among others like amentoflavone and astragalin (kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside). Moreover, coumarin, naringin, rutin, catechin, protocatechuic acid, and dihydromyricetin are also present in the leaves. Numerous harmful secondary substances have been identified, including glycosides like linamarin and compounds such as tannins, saponins, and lignin, which are typically removed through cooking and do not represent a safety concern [ 23 Various investigations have explored the composition of C. chayamansa 24 25 Methanolic leaf extracts were analyzed for phenolic content using the Folin–Ciocalteu method. It was found that gallic acid (71.3 ± 1.7 mg/g), catechin (42.6 ± 3.7 mg/g), protocatechuic acid (0.24 mg/g), and rutin (2.0 mg/g) were present. Three organic extracts of the leaves were evaluated, identifying flavonoids and coumarins in the ethyl acetate extract; flavonoids, coumarins, and lignins in the ethanolic extract; and various fatty acids in the hexane extract, such as lauric acid (31.9%), myristic acid (11.7%), palmitic acid (28.3%), oleic acid (5%), and arachidonic acid (4.8%) [ 11 24 Cnidoscolus chayamansa 26 27 In a study analyzing the chemical constituents of chaya leaves, samples were desiccated using both shade-drying and oven-drying techniques. Oven drying was found to be more efficient in minimizing residual moisture. The extraction of compounds was conducted through maceration using petroleum ether, ethanol, and distilled water. An examination of the constituents was executed via Soxhlet extraction processes, revealing the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, and saponins. The moisture and total ash levels (10.7%) were within the established parameters, validating the quality of the plant [ 28 4. Diabetes Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition caused by the body’s resistance to insulin, which leads to disturbances in maintaining glucose balance and can result in blood sugar fluctuations and complications related to blood vessels. The prevalence of diabetes and metabolic diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide, becoming a significant health issue with associated personal, social, and economic burdens. Data from the International Diabetes Federation indicate that an estimated 463 million adults globally are affected by diabetes. If no measures are taken to address this pandemic, projections suggest that around 578 million individuals could be dealing with diabetes by the year 2030, and this number might increase even further to 700 million by 2045. The yearly worldwide healthcare spending related to diabetes has been approximated at USD 760 billion. Therefore, the projected direct costs associated with managing diabetes are expected to reach USD 825 billion (USD 2500 per person in the US) by the year 2030 and further rise to USD 845 billion (around USD 2600 per person in the US) by the year 2045 [ 29 The widespread occurrence and diverse causes of diabetes emphasize the importance of finding treatments that can address its nature and associated complications effectively. Phytotherapeutic agents from natural sources, including chaya, are increasingly preferred over synthetic drugs because of their chemical diversity and lower incidence of adverse effects [ 30 31 4.1. Utilization in Diabetes 4.1.1. Mechanisms of Action The mechanisms of action of chaya against diabetes appear to be linked to compounds that influence the regulation of blood glucose levels. According to research findings, chaya extracts (especially methanolic and aqueous extracts) contain flavonoids like quercetin and rutin that could potentially lower blood sugar levels. The presence of antioxidants in chaya may aid in boosting insulin sensitivity for the management of blood sugar levels. Oxidative stress reduction by antioxidants could potentially enhance the performance of beta cells in the pancreas in terms of insulin production [ 24 In diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, cells undergo changes in how they process glucose, which may result in the production of oxygen species (ROS). These substances can harm cells by causing damage, including among beta cells that produce insulin, and can worsen insulin malfunction and resistance to it. Flavonoids are compounds found in chaya leaves and various plants, and they possess antioxidant qualities that enable them to counteract ROS’ effects by reducing oxidative stress and safeguarding cells from harm. This is crucial for diabetic cells, as it helps to maintain cellular function and protects against diabetic complications. In diabetes, especially when poorly controlled, LDL levels may be elevated. Circulating LDL can undergo oxidation due to high ROS concentrations, becoming oxidized LDL (oxLDL), which is particularly harmful. oxLDL contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition where the arteries harden and narrow due to cholesterol plaque buildup, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The consumption of flavonoids, such as those present in chaya leaves, can offer significant benefits for individuals with diabetes by reducing oxidative stress, improving cardiovascular health, and protecting cells from damage. These combined effects may aid in better diabetes management and reduce the risk of associated complications [ 24 An increase in LDL levels in the bloodstream poses a risk of artery disease, especially when it comes to oxidized LDL cholesterol. The “oxidative hypothesis of atherogenesis” suggests that the development of atheroma begins with foam cells generated from macrophages absorbing oxidized LDL uncontrollably within the subendothelium. These lipoproteins are harmful to the endothelium since they attract macrophages and monocytes to accumulate in the layer of blood vessels. This accumulation contributes to diseases like artery disease and is closely linked to diabetes, significantly heightening the risk of such conditions [ 24 Methanolic extracts from chaya have been found to boost the activity of beta cells and enhance insulin secretion, helping to regulate blood glucose levels in rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ). However, the mechanism does not resemble insulin’s action. Rather, it encourages efficient beta cell function. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes-related complications, including neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy; nevertheless, the antioxidant compounds found in chaya may mitigate oxidative damage and thereby contribute to the prevention or delay of these complications [ 24 The plant’s effectiveness in lowering blood sugar levels through activity seems to depend on the concentration of the extract being used, according to studies conducted with different doses, which revealed similar outcomes to commonly prescribed medications like metformin and glibenclamide [ 32 33 26 Figure 2 In addition to reducing glucose levels, chaya extracts have also been shown to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels in animal models, contributing to improved overall metabolic health in diabetic conditions. Type 2 diabetes often leads to inflammation and insulin resistance issues among affected individuals; the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties found in chaya may aid in reducing inflammation, according to research [ 32 4.1.2. In Vivo Studies Several in vivo studies have explored how methanolic (MeOH) extracts of Cnidoscolus chayamansa 24 33 Another study evaluated the effects of methanolic (MeOH) extracts in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes by administering doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg. The outcomes revealed the levels of glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides, with the reduction in glucose correlating to the dosage used. These results were comparable to the effects observed with standard anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin and glibenclamide [ 32 Furthermore, experiments conducted in rats using water extracts from dried Cnidoscolust chayamansa 26 Recent studies have revealed that extracts from C. chayamansa E. prostrata J. dioica 40 Another study examined the impacts of aqueous extracts of chaya on glycemic control in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat models. Chaya extracts from plants collected in Quintana Roo (Mayan region) and Durango (Northern Mexico) were compared, with metformin used as a reference drug for control purposes. The compositions of the extracts from both areas were examined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS-QQQ). The researchers conducted this study on tissues to investigate the impacts of extracts on Langerhans islets. At two weeks of treatment, with both extracts, hypoglycemic effects were evidenced. There was partial recovery of Langerhans islets. This effect of the treatment was consistent despite the plants being grown 2350 km apart under varying conditions. The compounds found in the two extracts showed no differences [ 41 In another research study performed on type 2 diabetic rats, it was examined how combining metformin with green tea and black tea derived from Cnidoscolous aconitifolius 42 Another study focused on assessing the protective effects of chaya leaf on mitochondrial abnormalities and synaptic damage in the TallyHO (TH) mouse model of type 2 diabetes, which shares several characteristics with human diabetes. The results showed that diabetic TH mice had body weight and fasting glucose levels comparable to those of diabetic mice, but those fed chaya experienced notable reductions in both areas. This information suggests that chaya may provide a safeguard against mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction in mice. This implies that chaya could be beneficial as a supplement for people at risk of or dealing with diabetes and metabolic disorders [ 43 In a research study investigating the effects of methanolic leaf extracts of Cnidoscolus aconitifolius 44 Type 2 diabetes is a health concern that affects many people globally. While there are medications to manage blood sugar levels orally, some individuals opt for herbal remedies due to their proven benefits. However, limited research has been conducted to investigate the interactions between medications like metformin and herbal remedies. These interactions could potentially impact the effectiveness of each treatment. In a study, the combination of metformin and chaya (an extract of Cnidoscolus aconitifolius 45 Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes commonly face inflammation caused by the production of pro-inflammatory proteins, like TNF alpha and ILS, due to NF-kB regulation and overexpression. A study aimed to explore the potential anti-inflammatory properties of specific fractions of chaya aqueous extracts that have been previously suggested to reduce inflammation levels in diabetic patients. The researchers examined the content of the sample fractions by employing solid-phase extraction and tracking them with HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The activation of NF-kB and the levels of the pro-inflammatory proteins TNF-alpha and IL-6 were evaluated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Two of the sample fractions exhibited notable anti-inflammatory properties in diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin. Two of the fractions demonstrated the most significant anti-inflammatory effects, even outperforming the crude extract, which contained the highest concentrations of compounds. The presence of ferulic acid in the chemical profile suggested that it may have played a key role in the observed anti-inflammatory effect. On the other hand, naringenin and apigenin, found exclusively in the extract, might have impeded this effect, accounting for the superior performance of these distinct fractions [ 46 Table 1 4.1.3. In Vitro Studies In a study performed to assess the antioxidant properties of a methanolic extract of Cnidoscolus chayamansa 24 Another assessment of the antioxidant properties through the oxygen absorbance capacity (ORAC) method found that uncooked leaves exhibited an ORAC value of 15.6 µeq Trolox/g. Meanwhile, cooked leaves showed a slightly lower value of 14.8 µeq Trolox/g. Furthermore, the total amount of phenolic compounds present was determined to be 1217.3 meq chlorogenic acid/kg in raw leaves and 733.5 meq/kg in cooked leaves. The decrease of 5% in ORAC and the 40% decrease in phenols in the leaves were attributed to the change in quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside content, which increased by 23% in the cooked leaves [ 25 Moreover, when assessing the antioxidant capacity with the DPPH method across three leaf extracts, it was observed that the hexane extract saw a reduction of 10.58%, while that of the ethyl acetate extract decreased by 11.68%. The ethanol extract exhibited a decline of 10.66%. The ethanol extract displayed polyphenol content of 35.70 meq AG/g according to the Folin–Ciocalteu method. This was followed by the hexane extract at 22.35 meq AG/g and the acetic ether extract at 13.25 meq AG/g. Another way to evaluate the antioxidant capacity in laboratory settings involves using the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) method. In this method, the hexane extract (Hex) showed an inhibition rate of 239.47 µmol Fe +2 +2 +2 11 47 C. chayamansa 47 Non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) are the leading causes of death worldwide. They are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Researchers have found that certain natural compounds derived from plants like Cnidoscolus aconitifolius C. aconitifolius 48 A different research project focused on creating and assessing capsules containing dried Cnidoscolus chayamansa v/v C. chayamansa 49 Another study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of a water-based extract and a combined extract (methanol/acetone/water) derived from chaya leaves and their impacts on mitochondrial bioenergetics and fatty acid oxidation. The antioxidant properties of both extracts derived from chaya leaves were found to be similar to those of nopal, a plant commonly used in medicine. The results indicated that the liquid extract from chaya leaves improved the function of mitochondria and the oxidation of fatty acids in liver cells. This suggests that it could be a treatment for liver issues linked to metabolic disorders [ 50 In addition, research conducted at the University of Querétaro in Mexico involved the cultivation of Cnidoscolus aconitifolius 51 A separate study was initially conducted on four atolls south of Tarawa in Kiribati and later extended to Tuvalu to investigate the mineral levels present in different types of local edible leafy plants. Variations in the ability of these plants to accumulate minerals in their leaves were analyzed, as well as their resistance to soils lacking essential nutrients. Farmers in the area grew plants in nurseries to then provide them to the rest of the farmers. Information leaflets highlighted the most suitable species among the 24 studied, including multiple examples of each. These included plants such as chaya, ofenga, hedgerow panax, and purslane, which have been shown in other studies to have beneficial effects against non-communicable diseases (NCDs) [ 18 Chaya is a shrub known for its medicinal properties, used since the time of the Mayan culture in Southeastern Mexico, and has been studied to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing blood pressure and blood glucose levels through six different types of leaf extracts (aqueous and alcoholic). In a recent study, the leaves used were collected in Timucuy, Yucatan, Mexico as part of the process for this specific study. For the extraction, 48 h maceration was used, with the proportions consisting of one part of the sample for every ten parts of the solvent (weight/volume). The solvents used were the following: distilled water, a mixture of ethanol and acetone together with ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, and hexane. The tests carried out included enzymatic inhibition against ACE, and the inhibition effects on the alpha glucosidase and alpha amylase enzymes were also evaluated in tests under controlled conditions. The hypotensive impact, the glycemic response to oral glucose overload, and the hypoglycemic effects in rats induced with obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia were also analyzed. The extracts with the lowest 50% inhibition concentrations (IC50) for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), alpha glucosidase, and alpha amylase were the following: acetone (12.61 µg/mL), ethyl acetate (22.97 µg/mL), and ethyl acetate (32 µg/mL). On the other hand, the aquaculture extract had a notable hypotensive effect, reducing systolic blood pressure by 15.5%. The highest percentage reduction in systolic blood pressure was observed in the methanol extract at a rate of 23%, while the hexane extract managed to reduce glucose levels by up to 22.88%. The findings revealed that all chaya extracts exhibited enzyme-inhibitory properties and hypotensive and hypoglycemic effects [ 52 The study performed in [ 53 pharmaceuticals-18-01242-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Summary of chaya’s biological activity, extract types, and dosages.

H 2 4.1.4. Clinical Studies Proper nutrition is essential in maintaining good health; to achieve this, the diet should include vegetables such as quelites. Quelites are edible wild plants that may help to prevent diabetes due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. A study was conducted to determine the glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) of rice and a tamal prepared with and without two types of quelites: alache ( Anoda cristata Cnidoscolus aconitifolius 2 54 Table 2 5. Conclusions In conclusion, scientific evidence supports the anti-diabetic properties of chaya leaf, highlighting its hypoglycemic and antioxidant properties. In vivo studies have demonstrated that the methanolic extract of C. chayamansa 24 32 33 26 42 Studies have also highlighted the role of the phenolic and antioxidant compounds present in chaya, such as quercetin and rutin, in reducing oxidative stress, a key factor in the pathogenesis of diabetes [ 40 42 47 In vitro research corroborates the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of chaya, suggesting that its consumption could mitigate the harmful effects of oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetes [ 48 49 In summary, chaya leaf represents a valuable and safe option in complementary therapies for diabetes, underscoring the need for further clinical studies in humans to confirm and expand these findings. The integration of herbal remedies with conventional treatments could offer a more holistic and effective approach to managing this chronic disease, but it is necessary to systematically explore doses, extraction methods, concentrations, the effects of isolated compounds, and interactions with other drugs for diabetes treatment; without this information, this plant will remain in the domain of folk medicine.

Issue Assessed Study Limitations Experimental Lab/Animal Studies  Mainly in vitro/in vivo studies; clinical applicability limited. Animal models only, lack of human or clinical trial support. Food matrix interaction is not fully understood. Limited dose standardization—no specific dosing guidelines or adverse effects discussed. No long-term effects studied. No correlation with human nutritional outcomes. High heterogeneity in methods; limited clinical correlation. Differences in animal models and impairment in sex distribution and variance because of species. Ethnobotanical  Mostly descriptive. Biological validation of plant evaluated. Does not link genetics and environmental changes to bioactivity. Phytochemical/Nutritional Studies  Lacks bioavailability and toxicity data; no in vivo relevance. High heterogeneity in methods; limited clinical correlation. ",
