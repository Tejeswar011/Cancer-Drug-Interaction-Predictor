See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ The gut-skin axis (GSA) embodies a complex, bidirectional interaction between the gastrointestinal (GI) system and skin, driven by immune modulation, systemic inflammation, and gut microbiota dynamics. Disruptions in gut homeostasis, including dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, are increasingly recognized as contributing factors to dermatological conditions such as acne, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. For gastroenterologists, appreciating this interplay is essential, as diseases and their treatments frequently present with cutaneous manifestations, offering diagnostic and therapeutic insights. This review explores the underlying mechanisms of the GSA, focusing on the microbiome and its metabolites as key regulators of inflammation and immunity. It underscores the clinical importance of microbiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications, in addressing both GI and dermatological disorders. Furthermore, the review examines the influence of GI conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease on skin health. This article seeks to equip gastroenterologists with practical insights for identifying, diagnosing, and managing skin conditions associated with GI health. The article also highlights the current limitations in knowledge regarding the GSA. The GSA represents a promising avenue for therapeutic advancements, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration between gastroenterology and dermatology to optimize patient care.

The article's secondary objective is to explore dermatological manifestations associated with GI disorders. UNDERSTANDING THE GSA The gut and skin function as important contact organs, serving as the means through which the mammalian body interacts with its surroundings. Emerging evidence indicates that the skin, which serves as a physical barrier against the external environment and is a highly vascularized organ that is metabolically and immunologically active, possesses its own unique microbiome and can influence gut health[ 7 8 9 et al 10 1 Figure 1  Gut-skin axis as part of the broader skin-gut-brain-immune system axis. According to the national institute of health (Human Microbiome Project), for instance, the GI tract and skin contain roughly 50% of the entire bacterial population (29% in the GI tract and 21% in the skin, respectively)[ 11 2 2 3 12 The precise mechanism that explains the interactions between gut and skin microbes has not been completely clarified yet, but it is likely that the immune and endocrine systems play a role in this process[ 13 14 15 16 In fact, the influence of microorganisms and metabolites on gut permeability and inflammatory response—both of which are variable—is directly linked to their effect on skin aging. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that resident cutaneous commensals may exert additional immunomodulatory effects, potentially influencing systemic inflammatory responses. Accordingly, dysbiosis of the cutaneous microbiome, often observed alongside gut dysbiosis, has been linked to the development of inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (AD), rosacea, and psoriasis[ 15 The neuroendocrine connection between the gut and skin microbiota is driven by the ability of gut microbes to stimulate brain circuits through the production of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, serotonin, and acetylcholine[ 17 18 18 The emergence of atopy is yet another connection between the gut and skin[ 19 20 21 Understanding the GSA requires taking into account the ethnic variations in dietary habits and, consequently, genetic impacts. For example, populations adhering to traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyles have a reduced incidence of acne, whereas individuals who consume a high-fibre Mediterranean diet have a decreased risk of AD[ 22 In a clinical context, GI and skin symptoms linked to conditions like rosacea, celiac disease, and IBD indicate the presence of the GSA. Although the association is thought to be reciprocal, dysbiosis and the resulting inflammation in the gut have been identified as the primary trigger in the majority of cases[ 8 MECHANISM OF INTERACTION To better understand how the GSA operates at the molecular level, this section highlights key pathways linking microbial metabolites to immune and barrier responses relevant to skin health. Gut dysbiosis alters the production of microbial metabolites, which in turn activate proinflammatory pathways via 23 2 Figure 2  Mechanism of gut-skin axis. A multitude of biological and environmental variables, including chronic stress, antibiotic usage, exposure to environmental pollutants, and a pro-inflammatory diet, lead to gut dysbiosis and therefore 'leaky gut’. Leaky gut syndrome may explain the increasing evidence of the association of intestinal disorders with autoimmune conditions and inflammatory skin conditions such as acne vulgaris, psoriasis, and chronic urticaria[ 24 Specific metabolites, such as free phenol and p-cresol, are generated by gut bacteria, particularly Clostridium difficile In vitro 25 1 Table 1 Key microbial metabolites and their effects on the gut-skin axis  Metabolite  Produced by  Effects on gut  Effects on skin SCFAs ( e.g. Firmicutes ( e.g. Faecalibacterium Enhances gut barrier, anti-inflammatory Promotes tregs, reduces inflammation p-Cresol  Clostridium difficile Increases gut permeability Decreases keratinocyte differentiation, causes xerosis Indole derivatives Tryptophan metabolism Modulates intestinal immunity via Influences skin inflammation and barrier repair Zonulin Enteric epithelial cells Increases intestinal permeability (\"leaky gut\") May indirectly increase risk of inflammation-related dermatoses Serotonin Enterochromaffin cells/gut flora Gut motility, mood regulation Implicated in pruritus and neurogenic inflammation Trimethylamine-N-oxide Gut bacteria metabolizing choline/carnitine ( e.g. Lachnoclostridium Increases systemic inflammation and oxidative stress; implicated in metabolic dysfunction May contribute to skin aging and inflammatory dermatoses (indirectly via SCFA: Short-chain fatty acid. In several murine investigations, probiotic-fed animals displayed notable skin alterations which subsequently stimulated the generation of T regulatory lymphocytes. Consequently, T regulatory cells possess the capacity to influence the immune system outside the GI tract[ 8 A key aspect of GSA is atopy development. Loss-of-function mutations in filaggrin, a protein crucial for the epidermal barrier, are associated with peanut allergy. Peanut allergens persist in dust and can be encountered through the skin before GI exposure. Studies suggest that early oral exposure to peanuts (before 12 months) lowers allergy risk in high-risk individuals, highlighting the importance of oral exposure before skin contact to prevent allergy development[ 21 22 Beyond microbial metabolites, dietary components also play a pivotal role in modulating the GSA, particularly in conditions such as acne where nutrient-driven metabolic signalling influences inflammation and microbiota composition. A high intake of carbohydrates and saturated fats disrupts nutritional signalling, affecting key regulators like forkhead box O1 and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which control lipogenesis via Propionibacterium acnes 26 Another crucial component of GSA is its connection to the neuroendocrine system. Gut microbiota changes can induce systemic inflammation, activating microglia and contributing to depression. Cytokines like IL-6 stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, increasing cortisol production and altering tryptophan metabolism, leading to reduced serotonin synthesis[ 27 28 29 2 Table 2 Shared cytokine pathways in gut and skin disorders  Cytokine  Source  Role in gut disease  Role in skin disease IL-17 Th17 cells Promotes mucosal inflammation in Crohn’s disease; may have protective roles in UC Drives psoriasis, AD IL-23 Dendritic cells, macrophages Supports Th17 expansion in IBD Involved in psoriatic inflammation TNF-α Macrophages, monocytes Central to both Crohn’s and UC pathogenesis Targeted in psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa IL-4 Th2 cells Mucosal immunity shift in some IBD variants Hallmark of atopic dermatitis IL-6 Multiple immune cells Acute phase reactant in IBD Links gut-brain-skin inflammation IFN-γ Th1 cells Epithelial barrier disruption Found in psoriatic and alopecia lesions IL-22 Th17 cells, innate lymphoid cells Promotes epithelial regeneration, but may drive pathology in IBD ( e.g. Promotes keratinocyte proliferation in psoriasis IL: Interleukin; UC: Ulcerative colitis; IBD: Inflammatory bowel disease; AD: Atopic dermatitis; IFN-γ: Interferon-gamma. CLINICAL IMPLICATION FOR GASTROENTEROLOGISTS Given the role of gut-skin interactions in systemic inflammatory states, it is not surprising that several GI diseases, particularly IBD, have well-documented dermatological associations. The GSA has role in both pathological and functional gut disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This section categorizes and describes these manifestations. It is evident that certain overlaps between gut and skin diseases may be attributable to genetic factors ( e.g. e.g. 3 Table 3 Common diseases/syndromes with their gastrointestinal and skin manifestations  Disease/syndrome  Skin manifestations  Associated GI malignancy  GI and other features Muir Torre syndrome (Variant of Lynch syndrome) Sebaceous adenoma.

IBD and associated skin conditions Cutaneous manifestations linked to IBD can be categorized into three groups based on their pathological characteristics: Those exhibiting features analogous to the affected GI tract (specific lesions), those that do not (reactive lesions), and associated lesions likely related to human leucocyte antigen linkage and the chronic inflammatory nature of IBD. Specific lesions result from the direct involvement of the skin by the identical pathogenic process observed in the GI tract. These manifestations are exclusively observed in Crohn's disease (CD), while ulcerative colitis (UC) often does not affect mucosal membranes. These encompass: (1) Perianal fissures and fistulas which occur in 36% of people with CD; and (2) Oral CD: Oral lesions manifest in 5%-20% of individuals with CD. The lesions do not consistently correspond with the activity of the underlying intestinal pathology. It can present as aphthous stomatitis, pyostomatitis vegetans (PSV), angular cheilitis, ulceration, mucosal nodularity, nodules of gingival and alveolar mucosa, and indurated fissuring of the lower lips, frequently painful and obstructive to consumption. Oral lesions are more common with CD, and vice versa. PSV is the sole oral lesion that manifests more frequently in UC[ 30 Metastatic CD Distinct granulomatous cutaneous lesions exhibiting identical histology to the intestinal lesions. Metastatic CD is primarily seen on the extremities or in intertriginous regions, with face and genital lesions infrequently documented. Reactive lesions are observed in both UC and CD. Cross antigenicity between the dermis and intestinal mucosa may account for reactive lesions. These include erythema nodosum (EN), pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), PSV and pyodermatitis vegetans (PDV).  EN: 31 32 33 35  PG: 36 Peristomal PG occurs in 0.6% of stoma patients yearly, often triggered by minor irritation, leading to painful ulcers that impair stoma function and social well-being. Postsurgical PG, linked to IBD in 5.9% of cases, starts as wound dehiscence in a normal scar. PG can appear before, during, or after IBD onset, independent of disease activity, significantly impacting patient morbidity and quality of life[ 37  PSV and PDV: 38 39 PDV, an uncommon IBD-related skin condition, presents as pustules and ulcerations in folds like the axilla or groin but can also affect the face, scalp, trunk, or limbs. Pustules rupture into erosions with hemorrhagic bases and distinct vegetative plaques[ 39 Associated lesions These include aphthous stomatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, hidradenitis suppurativa, reactive arthritis, eczema, clubbing of the nails, and acrodermatitis enteropathica. Aphthous stomatitis Up to 10% of IBD patients develop this third most common extra-intestinal symptom, marked by painful, round or oval ulcers on the buccal or labial mucosa[ 40 41 Streptococcus sanguinis 33 Acinetobacter johnsonii Streptococcus salivarius 42 Psoriasis IBD and psoriasis are chronic inflammatory diseases with relapsing-remitting courses, affecting the gut and skin barriers, respectively. Both peak between ages 15-30 and share immune dysregulation driven by genetic and environmental factors. Psoriasis affects 3%-4% of IBD patients, more commonly in CD, with shared susceptibility genes like interleukin (IL)-23R and overlapping inflammatory pathways involving tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-23, IL-17, and IL-22[ 43 Despite IL-17A’s role in both diseases, its inhibition improves psoriasis but worsens CD. Gut dysbiosis in psoriasis may trigger autoimmune responses through endotoxin-peptidoglycan superantigens. Some biologics, like infliximab, can induce secondary inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis in CD patients, due to cytokine imbalances - a phenomenon referred to as paradoxical inflammation[ 44 45 Celiac disease and its associated skin conditions Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is the key skin disorder linked to celiac disease and serves as a diagnostic marker. It is an autoimmune condition with intensely itchy, symmetrical lesions on the extensor surfaces, including the elbows, knees, scalp, and buttocks. Lesions vary from erythema and urticarial plaques to papules, blisters, erosions, and hyperpigmentation[ 45 46 Diagnosis involves clinical evaluation, histopathology, immunofluorescence, and serology. Direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin is the gold standard, while IgA anti- tissue transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibody antibodies help detect gluten sensitivity. A gluten-free diet is the main treatment, with dapsone, sulfasalazine, potent topical corticosteroids, and antihistamines as alternatives for symptom relief[ 47 Additional dermatological conditions linked to celiac disease encompass diseases demonstrated to improve with a gluten-free diet or the presence of serological markers of celiac disease include psoriasis, alopecia areata, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, AD, and chronic ulcerative stomatitis, among others. Diseases resulting from dietary deficiencies: Perioral and perianal dermatitis, alopecia, genital lesions (zinc deficiency), alopecia, xerosis, pruritus, koilonychia (iron deficiency), angular stomatitis (iron and vitamin B12 deficit), spiny skin (vitamin A deficiency), pellagra (niacin/vitamin PP insufficiency: Pellagra prevention). Dental complications: Enamel anomalies, delayed eruption. IBS and acne rosacea There is growing evidence to indicate that acne rosacea tends to occur more commonly in individuals suffering from IBS. This association between rosacea and GI conditions is believed to be mediated by shared genetic, microbial, and immune-related factors, forming the basis of the GSA. Persistent exposure to inflammatory triggers—such as certain foods, alcohol, and psychological stress—not only worsens rosacea but may also contribute to a state of chronic inflammation. This sustained inflammatory response might activate similar immune pathways implicated in IBS as well. Moreover, neurovascular alterations seen in rosacea could influence gut motility and visceral sensitivity, thereby playing a role in the manifestation of IBS symptoms[ 48 MICROBIOME AND SKIN DISORDERS The GSA reflects the bidirectional connection between gut and skin microbiomes and is supported by several observations as discussed in the next sections. From a clinical perspective, AD is associated with increased risk of IBD, cutaneous para-neoplasia is associated with increased risk of GI malignancies, psoriasis is associated with increased risks of UC and celiac disease, and hidradenitis suppurativa is associated with elevated risks of CD and UC[ 49 AD Epidermal barrier dysfunction is central to AD pathogenesis. Flaring lesions often show Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus 50 Recent evidence implicates gut microbial composition as a key modulator of skin inflammation, underscoring its role in the pathogenesis of AD and related conditions. Reduced Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 51 53 AD patients frequently exhibit decreased Bifidobacterium Bacteroides Enterobacteriaceae M. osloensis M. luteus Diet also influences AD, with lower intake of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, and higher omega-6 fatty acid consumption, linked to increased disease susceptibility[ 54 Psoriasis Psoriasis flare-ups can be triggered by microbes such as Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes Candida albicans Malassezia Corynebacterium Propionibacterium Staphylococcus Streptococcus 55 56 Both skin and gut dysbiosis influence psoriasis onset and flares. Gut microbiome changes include reduced Akkermansia muciniphila Ruminococcus megasphaera e.g. R. gnavus D. formicigenerans C. aerofaciens Prevotella copri Parabacteroides distasonis e.g. Escherichia coli 57 58 Rosacea Rosacea is associated with distinct microbial patterns. Demodex folliculorum Gordonia geobacillus Campylobacter ureolyticus Prevotella intermedia Acinetobacter Cutibacterium 59 60 Microbiome shifts also differ by subtype: Firmicutes Actinobacteria Prevotella copri Bacteroidales Syntrophomonadaceae Lachnospiraceae Anaerovorax Tyzzerella Akkermansia muciniphila Parabacteroides distasonis 61 Hidradenitis suppurativa Hidradenitis suppurativa is a rare immune-mediated chronic skin disease affecting 0.3% of the global population and primarily manifesting as occlusion of the apocrine glands. Lesions exhibit increased levels of anaerobic species, e.g. Prevotella Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium Parvimonas Bilophila Lachnobacterium 62 63 ROLE OF PRO/PRE-BIOTICS IN GSA The concept of using gut microbiome therapies to influence inflammatory skin diseases has been explored for some time. In a seminal paper, it was demonstrated that in a mouse model with psoriasis induced by imiquimod, the probiotic strain Lactiplantibacillus pentosus 64 4 Table 4 Gut-skin axis–linked diseases and their microbial dysbiosis profiles  Condition  Gut microbiome changes  Skin microbiome changes Atopic dermatitis ↓ Bifidobacteria F. prausnitzii Enterobacteriaceae ↑ S. aureus Psoriasis ↑ Ruminococcus Akkermansia muciniphila, ↓Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ↑ Corynebacterium Streptococcus Rosacea ↑ Prevotella intermedia Cutibacterium ↑ Demodex folliculorum Gordonia Hidradenitis suppurativa ↑ Porphyromonas Prevotella ↑ anaerobes Celiac disease ↑ Proteobacteria Lactobacillus Candida Associated with dermatitis herpetiformis Seborrheic dermatitis Altered lipid metabolism-related bacteria ( e.g. ↑ Malassezia species M. restricta Acne vulgaris ↓ Lactobacillus Proteobacteria ↑ Cutibacterium Propionibacterium acnes In psoriasis, it was demonstrated in animal studies that Bifidobacterium longum B. longum infantis 65 Bifidobacteria infantis 66 Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. lactis, and B. longum 67 Bacteroides fragilis 68 The frequent coexistence of GI and dermatologic pathology suggests a therapeutic opportunity, e.g. Gut dysbiosis has been noted in disorders including AD and rosacea, where the elimination of the related small intestine bacterial overgrowth results in substantial regression of the skin lesions[ 69 70 In pediatric patients with AD, supplementation with a probiotic blend consisting of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CECT 8145, B. longum CECT 7347, and lacticaseibacillus casei CECT 9104 Lactobacillus casei CECT 9104 71 72 Probiotic strains must remain viable in sufficient concentrations at the time of ingestion to exert clinical effects. Emerging evidence suggests that long-term dietary patterns may exert broader effects on gut microbial composition compared to short-term supplementation with probiotics or prebiotics, as both dietary fibre and weight reduction can diminish the prevalence of inflammatory bacteria. Certain probiotic and prebiotic interventions have been shown to modulate regulatory T cell responses and may support the restoration of barrier integrity in experimental models. Prebiotics, similar to probiotics, can markedly reduce the production of harmful fermentation byproducts, which may be advantageous for patients with AD[ 73 The World Allergy Organization does not endorse the use of prebiotics during pregnancy or breastfeeding as a preventive strategy for AD due to insufficient scientific data. Although other meta-analyses have indicated a marginally advantageous role due to immunological training in-utero[ 74 et al 75 Systemic probiotics may potentially reduce inflammation in acne. Probiotics decrease sebum levels, which leads to lesser follicular colonization by P acnes 73 Role of ultraviolet B light and vitamin D on gut microbiome Skin exposure to ultraviolet B light, and the resulting rise in serum vitamin D levels, has been shown to enhance both the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiome. This exposure led to the enrichment of several bacterial families, with serum vitamin D levels positively correlating with the relative abundance of the Lachnospira Fusicatenibacter 76 77 ROLE OF FAECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANT IN GSA Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) aims to restore gut dysbiosis and potentially improve outcomes in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including asthma and hidradenitis suppurativa[ 78 79 80 FMT works by delivering a healthy donor's gut microbiome through faeces to a patient. Although FMT is established for certain infectious conditions, its role in dermatological disease remains exploratory, supported primarily by case reports and small pilot studies. The understanding of gut microbiota dysbiosis in chronic inflammatory skin diseases has expanded. AD Kim et al 81 Psoriasis The severity of psoriasis is linked to the decrease in gut microbiota diversity. The first clinical case report on FMT application detailed a 36-year-old Chinese man who had severe plaque psoriasis for a decade and IBD for fifteen years. At the end of five-week treatment with FMT, serum tumour necrosis factor-α levels, PASI, histology, and intestinal symptoms improved from baseline. The first proof-of-concept study, a parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center superiority trial, including 31 participants, was conducted in 2015. The study found that FMT is safe but not more effective than sham for active peripheral psoriatic arthritis[ 82 Alopecia areata A pilot investigation observed alterations in the gut in pediatric patients with alopecia areata (AA) and discovered that Ruminococcus bicirculans 83 Systemic lupus erythematous Research on FMT for systemic lupus erythematous in mice suggests that restoring gut microbiota with acidic water may help regulate disease progression. A 12-week pilot study in 20 systemic lupus erythematous patients showed that weekly oral FMT reduced SLEDAI-2K scores and anti-ds deoxy ribonucleic acid antibodies without major side effects[ 84 FMT has also been studied in autoimmune conditions like Sjogren’s and Behcet’s disease, demonstrating potential in reducing chronic skin inflammation by restoring microbiome balance. However, challenges remain, including infection risks, donor-recipient compatibility, and regulatory hurdles, limiting its widespread adoption as a standardized treatment[ 84 EMERGING INSIGHTS ON GSA Earlier, microbial studies relied on culture-based methods, effective for common bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus Treponema pallidum 85 Shotgun metagenomics later enabled whole-genome sequencing, while advanced multi-omics approaches like meta-transcriptomics, meta-proteomics, and metabolomics offered deeper insights into microbial functions, enhancing our understanding of health and disease[ 86 Research into biomarkers that bridge gut health and skin disease severity or treatment outcomes is still in its infancy. However, the premise that the gut microbiome can influence disease course is supported by studies demonstrating that faecal microbial composition can predict responses to PD-1-based immunotherapy for epithelial tumuors[ 87 ruminococcaceae B. longum Collinsella aerofaciens, Enterococcus faecium 88 Separately, intestinal fatty acid binding protein and claudin-3, both biomarkers for gut permeability, are reportedly elevated in psoriasis and correlate with disease severity[ 89 Studies examining the role of the gut microbiome in therapy response are scarce in dermatology, with most investigations focusing on IBD or rheumatologic autoimmune conditions. In rheumatoid arthritis, emerging data indicate that pre-treatment abundance of gut bacterial taxa and their genes are associated with future clinical response of methotrexate[ 90 91 KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN THE GSA Despite notable advances, it remains unclear whether microbiome imbalances directly drive inflammation in skin conditions such as psoriasis and AD or if they merely reflect a host environment already primed for inflammation[ 92 93 The precise causal links between microbiome dysbiosis and disease progression are more clearly defined in some conditions, such as AD, than in others such as hidradenitis suppurativa and psoriasis. It also remains uncertain whether microbiome-associated findings represent true causative factors or are confounded by external environmental exposures. On a general note, comparison of findings across different investigations is complicated by heterogeneity in sampling approaches (swabs vs 94 95 96 Finally, single cell engineered live biotherapeutic products are novel engineered live microorganisms to perform specific functions and represent a promising new avenue. Although tested primarily in vitro in vivo 97 INTEGRATED GASTROENTEROLOGY-DERMATOLOGY APPROACHES TO PATIENT MANAGEMENT Inflammatory intestinal and skin diseases often share overlapping pathophysiology, present with highly variable clinical features, and carry increased risks of comorbid inflammatory conditions. These factors can result in diagnostic delays and challenges in distinguishing new disease processes from treatment side effects. In addition, chronic immune-mediated diseases have influential effects on co-occurring inflammatory diseases[ 98 99 100 CONCLUSION To fully harness the potential of GSA research and its clinical applications, a more coordinated, data-driven approach is essential. In particular, the following strategies warrant priority: (1) Standardized protocols: Harmonizing sample collection, sequencing, and analytic workflows will enable more direct comparisons and reproducible findings across studies; (2) Mechanistic investigations: Employing complementary ex vivo in vitro In situ e.g. via ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks to Anushka Saraswat for her assistance in creating the figures and tables.
