Eligible participants included stable heart failure patients aged 18–85 years, classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III, who had practiced Baduanjin 2.2 Data collection 2.2.1 Procedures, equipment, and requirements Our study was conducted in the CR department at the Heart Failure Center at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine. The main process of this study included three steps ( Figure 1 2 Baduanjin Table 1 FIGURE 1 Study procedures Legends: NYHA, New York Heart Association; BMI, body mass index; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; HFmrEF, heart failure with middle ranged ejection fraction; HFpEF, heart failure with perceived ejection fraction; VO 2 Flowchart comparing cardiopulmonary and hemodynamic responses to Baduanjin and cycle ergometer exercises in chronic heart failure patients. It involves enrollment, preparation, two exercises, and data collection. Exercise 1 is a 9-minute Baduanjin session; Exercise 2 is a cycle ergometer exercise adjusted to Equal VO2. Data on CPET parameters and hemodynamics are recorded continuously. The chart includes participant demographics and baseline information. 2.3 Statistical analysis We adopted statistical analyses similar to those described in our previous work ( Chen et al., 2020 Baduanjin 2 Baduanjin 2max max Norton et al., 2010 3 Results 3.1 Participant characteristics The participants (n = 30, 29 male and 1 female, ages 61.1 ± 11.0 years) had a clinical history of heart failure for a median of 3.5 years and were classified as either New York Heart Association (NYHA) II (n = 19, 63.3%) or NYHA III (n = 11, 36.7%). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 49.4% ± 13.4%, and they were either with reduced LVEF (HFrEF, n = 9, 30.0%), middle ranged LVEF (HFmrEF, n = 7, 23.3%), or preserved LVEF n (HFpEF, n = 14, 46.7%). In addition, 96.7% of the participants (n = 29) had been taking β-blockers. Spirometry showed that 66.7% (n = 20) of participants had normal lung function; and 26.7% (n = 8), 3.3% (n = 1), and 3.3% (n = 1) showed restrictive, obstructive, and mixed pulmonary ventilatory dysfunction, respectively.
