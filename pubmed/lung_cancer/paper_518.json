Similarly, a homology‐based model was developed to understand the spatial arrangement of conserved motifs of the MAGL protein to predict sites actively involved in substrate binding. In addition, whole‐genome re‐sequenced information available for the diverse set of soybean germplasm was used to study the haplotypic distribution. The sequencing data also helped to identify variations predicted to have a high impact on MAGL functionality. A gene‐specific association study revealed the significant association of MAGL genes with oil and fatty acid content. The present study has used large‐scale transcriptomic data to develop a gene co‐expression network and predict hub genes possibly having a regulatory role. The study will be helpful to understand the role of MAGL in plants and the pragmatic strategy to manipulate MAGL genes for high oil content with better quality in oilseed crops. Results Genome‐wide identification and evolutionary analysis of monoacylglycerol lipases (MAGL) The MAGL gene family was identified in Arabidopsis (16), medicago (15), soybean (21), and rice (17); and their phylogenetic analysis showed five major groups, each of which were further grouped into two or three sub‐groups (Figures 1a 2a MAGL Glycine soja G. max MAGL MAGL 2a MAGL G. soja G. max MAGL 2a G. soja MAGL G. max MAGL MAGL G. max G. soja G. soja MAGL G. max MAGL S1 MAGL MAGL MAGL 1b Glyma.13G046000 G. soja Figure 1 Similarity clustering and collinear synteny of monoacylglycerol lipase MAGL Glycine max Glycine soja G. max G. soja Figure 2 Phylogenetic distribution, conserved amino acid, and motifs of monoacylglycerol lipase MAGL Glycine soja monoacylglycerol lipase MAGL Conserved features, subcellular localization, chemical and physical properties of monoacylglycerol lipases All the identified MAGLs contained α/beta hydrolase domain, GXSXG conserved motifs, and the catalytic triad of S, D, and H based on the multiple sequence alignment and mutual information (MI) network between the residues, sequence conservation, the residue cumulative and proximity MI scores (Figures 2b S2 2b 2a The MAGLs were localized in the plasma membrane, chloroplast, mitochondria, nuclear, extracellular, and cytoplasm (Table S2 S3 Loc Os01g10250 medtr3g109870 medtr6g071475 Glyma 08 g056600 G. soja S4 The soybean MAGL Glyma07G092100 S3 Glyma 09G171800 S3 S3 S5 Tertiary protein structure of monoacylglycerol lipases The homology‐based model was developed to understand the spatial arrangement of conserved motifs of MAGL protein. The molecular three‐dimensional protein structure modeling of MAGL was determined by comparing it to the well‐studied human 3HJU protein and Arabidopsis. The protein structure of all 21 MAGL proteins in soybean was similar to Arabidopsis and human MAGL proteins (Figure S4 3A S4 3A 3A 3B Stability 3B Stability 3B Figure 3 (A) The protein tertiary structure of soybean monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) protein.

Lipid catabolism is also essential for the remobilization and detoxification of membrane lipids of plant species caused by senescence and abiotic stresses, including heavy metal stress (Gao et al 2010 et al 2002 2004 et al 2013 et al 2019 et al 2016 MAGL G. max G. soja MAGL G. max G. soja G. max G. soja G. soja The known TAG lipase has Hx 4 2010 4 et al 2012 4 et al 2016 2016 4 Glyma.10G21120 2016 The biochemical and physical properties of protein play an important role in determining the molecular and biological function of a protein. The large variation in molecular weight (from 19 to 40 kD) and length (175–396 amino acids) of soybean MAGL suggests structural and functional diversity. The subcellular localization of MAGL was also predicted and was localized in mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, and other locations, and these might be responsible for the breakdown of TAG and/or membrane lipid remodeling. Kim et al 2016 At1g77420 et al 2016 10G273600 20G116400 et al 2002 The tertiary (3D) structure of all MAGL proteins has been investigated using computational molecular modeling against the human HsMAGL. This analysis showed that all proteins share a common ab‐hydrolase fold and catalytic triad (S, H, and D) which is essential for enzymatic activity. The alternations of Glycine residue of GxSxG motif in the case of Arabidopsis led to the altered shape of the catalytic triad and ultimately decreased enzymatic activity (Kim and Suh, 2016 Domestication is a bottleneck of genetic diversity, and this was also observed in MAGL MAGLs G. max G. soja MAGL MAGL et al 2016 et al 2022 MAGL et al 2022 AtWRI1 AtDGAT1 et al 2022 et al 2019 The MAGL is known to be involved in the detoxification of membrane lipids, which is very important in abiotic stress conditions. The gene expression analysis shows that genes are mainly expressed in heat, drought, and seedling stages. The high expression of Arabidopsis MAGL At1g52760 et al 2012 et al 2010 Glyma 13G101400 et al 2020 MAGL et al 2020 et al 2012 et al 2010 Glyma.03G214800 et al 2021 et al 2019 Glyma.13G183800 Glyma.05G248100 MAGL Results obtained here with the yeast BODIPY assay showed that the expression of GmMAGL in yeast alters the lipid deposition and metabolism. Smaller and dispersed droplets observed in yeast expressing GmMAGL compared to the control suggest its involvement in lipid hydrolysis, which affects the overall lipid turnover. In addition, these results were confirmed with the FACS analysis of BODIPY493/503‐stained yeast, where reduced fluorescence was observed with the GmMAGL expression. The results obtained with confocal microscopy and FACS both indicate the probable role of GmMAGL in lipid metabolism. However, the yeast survival assay under different stress conditions failed to show any effect of MAGL under osmotic stress, high salinity, and heavy metal (arsenic stress). Similar results have been reported in a recent study where Arachis hypogaea MAGL overexpressed in Arabidopsis showed no effect on growth and physiological parameters but was found to alter lipid biosynthesis (Zhang et al 2024 Conclusion The MAGL homologs identified in diverse plant species and particularly in wild and cultivated soybean species helped to highlight several interesting facts.

Potassium silicate and sodium arsenite were used as the sources of Si and As(III), respectively. Plant samples were collected after 60 days of treatment. Total RNA was extracted from the root, stem, and leaf of control and stressed plants using Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit. The RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific™) was used to convert the total RNA into cDNA. The qPCR was performed using SYBR® Green Master Mix (Bio‐Rad) and the BioRad CFX Connect real‐time PCR detection system (Bio‐Rad). Each 10 μL reaction comprises 5 μL SYBR ® 2 S1 et al 2008 Quantification of lipid content in yeast using BODIPY493/503 fluorescent lipophilic dye The coding sequences for selected MAGL genes were amplified from a soybean cDNA library using gene‐specific primers carrying appropriate restriction sites. The amplified gene sequences were ligated into the pYES2.1 vector under galactose‐inducible promoter, carrying the URA3 selectable marker. The clones were further confirmed by sequencing. The MAGL: pYES2.1 vectors and empty pYES2.1 vector were individually transformed into yeast strain INVSc using the EZ‐Yeast™ Transformation Kit (MP Biomedicals). The yeast transformants were grown in SD/−ura medium with 2% glucose at 30 °C for 3 days. The transformants were further confirmed by colony PCR. Three individual transformants for each gene and the empty vector were further used in the study. The yeast cells harbouring MAGL:pYES2.1 vectors and the empty pYES2.1 vector were grown in SD/−ura broth with 2% dextrose for 24 h at 30 °C. After incubation, OD600 for all the cultures was adjusted to 0.4, and fresh cultures were initiated from them in SD/−ura broth with 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. The cultures were grown at 30 °C for 24 h and were further used for BODIPY493/503 staining to measure the lipid degradation due to overexpression of MAGL genes. The 1 μL of 2 mg/mL BODIPY493/503 solution in DMSO was added to each of the 1 mL yeast cultures. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the dark. After the incubation, the cells were washed thrice with PBS buffer. Finally, the cells were suspended in PBS buffer and diluted 1 : 10 in PBS buffer, and subsequently visualized under a confocal microscope. The cells were also used for Fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. The FACS analysis for the stained cells was performed on a BD FACS Aria Fusion machine. The analysis was performed with side scatter (SSC) and LB fluorescence using FITC (530 ± 15 nm excited at 488 nm) filters with similar settings for all the samples. Yeast survival and growth assay Yeast survival and growth assay was performed to test the effect of soybean MAGL on arsenic, mannitol, and salinity (NaCl) stress.
