Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of myocardial infarction and stroke, which is characterized as a chronic inflammatory disease due to the aberrant accumulation of apoptotic cells in the necrotic core. Previous CD47-SIRPα checkpoint blockage strategies based on monoclonal antibodies or nanoparticles have shown significant pro-efferocytosis effects and thus improved the inflammatory microenvironment of plaque. However, apoptotic foam cells and concentrated cholesterol render plaque macrophages an overwhelming lipid burden, limiting the pro-efferocytosis effect of checkpoint blockade therapy in atherosclerosis. In this study, we fabricate a retinoic acid-loaded macrophage membrane-biomimetic liposome (R@MLP) to improve the efferocytosis ability of macrophages further. Mechanistically, the innate existence of SIRPα on the R@MLP would block the binding of CD47 on apoptotic cells with SIRPα on macrophages to realize the CD47-SIRPα inhibition. Consequently, engulfing retinoic acid in R@MLP would upregulate the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 of macrophages and enhance cholesterol efflux. In the mouse model of atherosclerosis, which benefited from the macrophage membrane, R@MLP showed ideal inflammation targeting ability to plaques and further reinforced the efferocytosis ability of macrophages. Ultimately, R@MLP shifted macrophages to the anti-inflammatory state and attenuated the progression of atherosclerosis. R@MLP synergizes checkpoint inhibition and cholesterol efflux to boost pro-efferocytosis therapy and presents a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis management.

Macrophage membranes were isolated in vitro 2 Method 2.1 Animals and cell lines Male ApoE −/− 2.2 Isolation and verification of macrophage membrane Macrophage membranes (M) were acquired using a previously reported method with a minor modification [ 28 29 8 g 3 g g g Macrophage membranes devoid of SIRPα (MKD) were generated through a two-step process. SIRPα was knocked down in the RAW264.7 cell line using SIRPα-specific shRNA to construct a stable knockdown cell line. Subsequently, these genetically modified cells were subjected to the aforementioned membrane extraction protocol. 2.3 Synthesis of LP and R@LP According to the previously published article, conventional liposomes were prepared using the thin-film hydration and extrusion method with minor modifications [ 8 2.4 Preparation of MLPKD, R@MLPKD, MLP and R@MLP A mechanical co-extrusion method was used to fuse the macrophage membrane and the LP or R@LP nanoparticles to obtain M or MKD biomimetic nanoparticles. Firstly, the collected M or MKD vesicles were mixed with nanoparticle cores with a membrane protein-to-polymer weight ratio of 1:1, and the mixture was sonicated with a bath sonicator at a frequency of 42 kHz and a power of 100 W for 2 min. Then, the mixture was extruded 15–20 times through a mini-extruder to obtain MLPKD, R@MLPKD, MLP, and R@MLP nanoparticles. Finally, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000× g 2.5 Construction of AS in ApoE −/− Six-week-old ApoE −/− in vivo 2.6 Bone marrow-derived macrophages(BMDMs) BMDMs were acquired using a previously reported method with a minor modification [ 30 31 2.7 Construction of foam cell-derived apoptotic cells (FCDACs) FCDACs were acquired using a previously reported method with a minor modification [ 32 2.8 Preparation of nanoparticles-decorated FCDACs(NPs-decorated FCDACs) FCDACs were prepared by staining with DiD dye and subjected to a 30-min pretreatment with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), MLPKD, R@MLPKD, MLP, or R@MLP. After incubation, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the NPs-decorated FCDACs were resuspended in fresh complete medium for subsequent use. 2.9 In vitro In brief, BMDMs were seeded in 35 mm glass-bottom culture dishes at a density of 3 × 10^5 cells per well. NP-decorated FCDACs were co-incubated with BMDMs in fresh complete medium for 2 h at a 5:1 (FCDACs: BMDMs) cell ratio. Following the co-incubation period, the culture medium was aspirated, and the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde. Macrophage cell membranes were then labeled with Texas-Red-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Efferocytosis activity was observed and quantified through confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, enabling a comprehensive high-resolution assessment of phagocytic efficiency under various treatment conditions. 2.10 In vitro NP-decorated FCDACs were co-incubated with BMDMs in fresh complete medium for 2 h at a 5:1 (FCDACs: BMDMs) cell ratio. Subsequently, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS to eliminate unphagocytosed apoptotic cells. BMDMs were incubated with 10 μM BODIPY-cholesterol for 2 h, after which the labeling solution was replaced with fresh complete medium. To quantify the cholesterol efflux rate, time-lapse confocal microscopy was employed to acquire images of the same microscopic field over a duration of 60 min. The total mean fluorescence intensity for each cell was determined by normalizing the fluorescence intensity to the corresponding cell area. The difference in mean fluorescence intensity between the time points of 0 and 60 min was subsequently divided by the 60-min interval to calculate the efflux rate for each cell. For efflux-ratio analysis, cells were incubated for 4 h in fresh complete medium, and the culture supernatant and cell pellet were collected separately. Their fluorescence was then measured using a microplate reader. The efflux ratio was calculated as fluorescence_supernatant/(fluorescence_supernatant + fluorescence_cells). Oil Red O staining assessed intracellular lipid droplet content and reflected cholesterol efflux levels in RAW 264.7. 2.11 In vitro inflammatory factor RNA expression level detection After co-incubating with NPs-decorated FCDACs for 2 h, the RAW264.7 cells were then replaced with fresh complete medium for 24 h. RNA isolation was performed with the Super FastPure Cell RNA Isolation Kit (RC102-01, Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd). qRT-PCR was performed to quantify mRNA expression of actin (internal control), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and immunoregulatory markers (IL-10, TGF-β, Arg1). 2.12 In vivo Eight-week-old female ApoE −/− 2.13 In vivo −/− ApoE −/− −/− 2.14 In vivo efferocytosis assay We defined apoptotic cell debris that macrophages had phagocytosed as TUNEL-positive signals that did not colocalize with DAPI. Among these, TUNEL signals that colocalized with the macrophage marker F4/80 were counted as macrophage-associated, whereas those without F4/80 colocalization were considered free TUNEL signals, enabling an in vivo 2.15 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis relied on Student's t-test, one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods using GraphPad Prism (v8.0.1). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were presented as the mean value ± s.d. 3 Result 3.1 Preparation, characterization, and CD47 blocking efficiency of R@MLP As illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Schematic representation of R@MLP fabrication and its dual-action mechanism in pro-efferocytosis therapy. This novel nanoparticle system is designed to synergistically inhibit immune checkpoints and promote cholesterol efflux, functioning analogously to digestive aids in its approach to ameliorating atherosclerosis. The R@MLP construct combines checkpoint inhibition with enhanced lipid metabolism to effectively clear apoptotic cells and reduce plaque formation. Fig. 1 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) was employed to measure the particle size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI) of LP, MLPKD, R@MLPKD, MLP, and R@MLP. No significant differences in particle size were observed among the groups, with mean diameters of 103.04 ± 3.88, 113.06 ± 3.23, 116.20 ± 3.97, 117.79 ± 3.81, and 116.63 ± 7.60 nm, respectively ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. S1D Fig. 2 Fig. S1A–D Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Preparation, characterization, and CD47 blocking efficiency of R@MLP (A) Diameter, (B) PDI, and (C) Zeta potential of LP, MLPKD, R@MLPKD, MLP, and R@MLP.

Fig. 2 To evaluate the liposomes' CD47-blocking capacity, apoptotic cells were co-incubated with different liposomes for 2 h. After centrifugation to remove unbound nanoparticles, the CD47-blocked apoptotic cells were obtained. Flow cytometry analysis of FITC-labeled CD47 antibody-stained cells revealed a notable leftward shift in the MFI peak, indicating effective CD47 blockade ( Fig. 2 Retinoic acid-loaded macrophage membrane-biomimetic liposomes (R@MLP) were successfully prepared. 3.2 Targeting ability of R@MLP in vitro in vivo We next evaluated whether R@MLP could improve the targeting ability of liposomes. Our previous studies demonstrated that cell membrane-mimicking nanoparticles mainly rely on interacting with surface adhesion molecules (CCR2, CD18) and ICAM-1 to display chemotactic properties toward inflammatory sites [ 33 34 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Targeting ability of R@MLP in vitro in vivo −/− in vitro Fig. 3 To confirm whether nanoparticles can adhere to FCDACs, they were co-incubated with FCDACs for 2 h. Confocal images show that MLP accumulated on the membrane of FCDACs more than MLPKD and LP ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Subsequently, we constructed a Transwell model to test R@MLP's ability to traverse endothelial cells. HUVECs were cultured in 0.4 μm hanging cell culture inserts until reaching 100 % confluence. After treatment with TNFα for 6 h, DiD-labeled nanoparticles were added. We found that the fluorescence of membrane-biomimetic liposomes in the lower chamber was significantly higher than that of liposomes without membrane modification ( Fig. 3 We then verified the ability of R@MLP to target atherosclerotic plaques in vivo −/− Fig. 3 Fig. 3 3.3 Promoting efferocytosis and cholesterol efflux in vitro We first validated the successful preparation of the FCDACs model. Raw264.7 cells were co-incubated with ox-LDL for 24 h, followed by staurosporine treatment for 2 h to induce foam cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis of caspase-3 confirmed the establishment of the foam cell apoptosis model ( Fig. S2A–C Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. S3 Fig. 4 Promoting efferocytosis and cholesterol efflux in vitro + - − + Fig. 4 Next, the impact of R@MLP on the polarization state of macrophages was examined. Flow cytometry results indicated a significant increase in the proportion of CD206-positive macrophages in the R@MLP group, reflecting a shift towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype after enhanced efferocytosis ( Fig. 4 S4A Fig. S5A and S5B Subsequently, we investigated whether the retinoic acid carried by R@MLP could promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Western blot analysis revealed that R@MLP significantly increased the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in macrophages ( Fig. 4 Fig. S5C Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. S6A and S6B We also observed LXRα, a transcription factor activated by retinoic acid that then upregulates ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression, translocating into the nucleus. The confocal image shows that the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of LXRα significantly increased in the R@MLP group ( Fig. S7A and B These results demonstrate that the SIRPα on R@MLP's surface effectively blocked CD47 on apoptotic cells, promoting the phagocytic process. Furthermore, as macrophages phagocytose apoptotic cells along with R@MLP, the increased expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 facilitates the efflux of excess cholesterol from the macrophages. By combining these two effects, R@MLP ultimately enhanced macrophage efferocytosis and promoted the transition of macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. 3.4 Anti-atherosclerosis efficacy by R@MLP To validate the therapeutic efficacy of R@MLP in atherosclerosis, we designed an experiment ( Fig. 5 −/− Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Anti-atherosclerosis efficacy by R@MLP (A) The in vivo Fig. 5 It is worth noting that, as R@MLP primarily focuses on enhancing macrophage efferocytosis, no significant reductions in body weight or blood lipid levels were observed in any treatment group compared to the PBS group ( Fig. 5 These in vivo −/− in vitro 3.5 Promoting efferocytosis and cholesterol efflux in vivo To validate whether R@MLP exhibits the exact therapeutic mechanism in vivo in vitro in vivo in vivo Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Promoting efferocytosis and cholesterol efflux in vivo −/− −/− −/− Fig. 6 Furthermore, proteins extracted from whole aortas were analyzed via Western blot. Consistent with in vitro Fig. 6 S8A S8B Fig. 6 Fig. 6 in vivo Fig. 6 Fig. S8C–F in vitro In conclusion, R@MLP demonstrated a therapeutic mechanism in vivo in vitro 3.6 Biocompatibility of R@MLP Finally, the biocompatibility of R@MLP was evaluated in healthy mice. 7 days post-injection, no significant morphological alterations were observed in major organs, including the liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and brain, compared to the PBS group ( Fig. S9A PBS Fig. S9B and S9C 4 Discussion Enhancing efferocytosis or cholesterol efflux—such as blocking the CD47-SIRPα axis with anti-CD47 antibodies or SHP1 inhibitors—attenuates atherosclerosis [ 9 10 15 35 36 Our R@MLP meets this need by simultaneously blocking CD47-SIRPα and stimulating cholesterol efflux, thereby synergistically improving atherosclerosis. Efferocytosis-oriented therapies now include CD47/SHP1 antagonists, MerTK or LRP1 protectors, and nanoparticle systems that trigger apoptosis or deliver anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., effero-RLP-rosiglitazone) [ 9 10 [37] [38] [39] 40 41 Previous research has demonstrated that SIRPα knockout in macrophages enhances cholesterol efflux without altering ABCA1 mRNA levels [ 42 43 22 44 45 46 Defective efferocytosis skews plaques toward pro-inflammatory macrophages, whereas efficient efferocytosis, together with robust cholesterol efflux, shifts them to an anti-inflammatory state and dampens plaque inflammation [ 45 [47] [48] [49] R@MLP combines CD47-SIRPα blockade with retinoic-acid–driven cholesterol efflux, synergistically restoring macrophage function. Because macrophage efflux contributes only marginally to systemic lipid clearance [ 50 51 5 Conclusion This study prepared macrophage membrane-biomimetic liposomes loaded with retinoic acid (R@MLP) to target and block the apoptotic cells with elevated CD47 levels in atherosclerotic plaques. This approach promotes macrophage phagocytosis while facilitating cholesterol efflux through the delivered retinoic acid, thereby improving the lipid burden in macrophages. The synergistic effects of these two mechanisms ultimately drive the transition of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype, reducing plaque inflammation. This anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering combination therapy, which enhances phagocytosis and improves cholesterol metabolism, effectively ameliorates atherosclerosis and holds significant potential for clinical translation.
