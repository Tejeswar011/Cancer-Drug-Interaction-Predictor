Background Acute exacerbation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lacks reliable biomarkers. This study aimed to explore the predictive value of serum interleukin-33 (IL-33) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). Methods This retrospective study included patients with stable-phase COPD between June 2023 and June 2024 at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. Patients were assigned to the low-risk and high-risk groups according to the number and severity of AECOPD events. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors of AECOPD risk. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the predictive value of IL-33 and TSLP for AECOPD risk. Results A total of 76 patients were enrolled, with 33 in the low-risk group and 43 in the high-risk group. Serum IL-33 (835.30 vs. 770.30, p p p Conclusion High serum TSLP might be associated with an increased risk of AECOPD. While IL-33 alone showed high sensitivity and low specificity, its potential predictive value may be worth exploring. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute exacerbation interleukin-33 thymic stromal lymphopoietin risk prediction The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the predictive value of serum IL-33 and TSLP for AECOPD. Materials and methods Study design and patients This retrospective study included patients with stable-phase COPD treated between June 2023 and June 2024 at the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (2023–055-01). The requirement for individual informed consent was waived by the committee due to the retrospective nature of the study. The inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of COPD based on the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (2021 Revised Edition) ( 13 Patients were assigned to the low-risk and high-risk groups according to the number and severity of AE. Patients with ≤1 moderate to severe AE (not leading to hospital admission) within 1 year were assigned to the low-risk group, while patients with ≥2 moderate to severe AEs or ≥1 AE that led to hospitalization within 1 year were assigned to the high-risk group ( 14 17 Data collection and definition Data were collected on sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and the number of hospitalizations due to AE. IL-33 and TSLP levels in the stable phase were determined routinely during the study period using ELISA kits (Guangzhou Huayun Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. During the study period, pulmonary function was assessed during the stable phase using a MasterScreen spirometer (Jaeger, Germany). The measurements included forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value (FEV1%pred), forced vital capacity (FVC), FVC as a percentage of the predicted value (FVC% pred), and the FEV1/FVC ratio. Each patient underwent three repeated tests, and the best result was recorded. The testing procedures adhered to the standards established by the American Thoracic Society ( 13 The diagnosis of AE was mainly based on the fact that one or more of the main symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, and expectoration, worsen within a short period (usually several days to weeks), and the degree of change in symptoms exceeds the daily fluctuation range. There are also changes in the characteristics of sputum (such as an increase in sputum volume, purulent sputum, etc.) in COPD patients ( 18 Statistical analysis Data analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous data with a normal distribution were expressed as means ± standard deviations and analyzed using the independent samples t n p p Results Characteristics of the low-risk and high-risk groups The patients were divided into the low-risk ( n n Figure 1 p 2 p p p Table 1 Figure 1 Flowchart for screening research population.

Predictive value of serum IL-33 and TSLP for the risk of AECOPD At the optimal cutoff value of 712.95 pg./mL for IL-33, the AUC was 0.677 (95% CI: 0.554–0.801), sensitivity was 93.0%, and specificity was 39.4%. At the optimal cutoff value of 95.33 pg./mL for TSLP, the AUC was 0.768 (95% CI: 0.659–0.878), sensitivity was 76.7%, and specificity was 72.7%. The combined prediction using IL-33 and TSLP yielded an AUC of 0.779 (95% CI: 0.669–0.888), with a sensitivity of 81.4% and specificity of 72.7% ( Figure 2 Table 3 Figure 2 Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves showing the predictive value of serum interleukin (IL-33) and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) for the risk of AECOPD.

Discussion The results suggested that high serum TSLP is associated with an increased risk of AECOPD. While IL-33 alone showed high sensitivity and low specificity, its potential predictive value may be worth exploring. The study showed that the average serum IL-33 level in the high-risk group for AE was higher than in the low-risk group. The difference could be associated with the role of IL-33 in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbations in COPD. Indeed, IL-33 is a member of the IL-1 cytokine family and plays a crucial role in innate and adaptive immune responses ( 9 19 21 22 23 24 26 The present study also showed that the serum TSLP levels in the high-risk group for AEs were significantly higher than in the low-risk group. This difference may be related to the pathophysiological role of TSLP in AECOPD. TSLP is produced by epithelial cells in various tissues, such as the lungs, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as by dendritic cells, keratinocytes, stromal cells, basophils, and mast cells ( 24 27 28 29 30 23 This study found that the AUC for TSLP in predicting AE risk was 0.768 (95% CI: 0.659–0.878), with a sensitivity of 76.7% and a specificity of 72.7%. A previous study showed that TSLP could be predictive of AE events but only in patients with low EOS counts. Such a subgroup analysis was not possible in the present study due to the sample size and the retrospective nature of the study. Combining IL-33 and TSLP yielded an AUC of 0.779 (95% CI: 0.669–0.888), with a sensitivity of 81.4% and a specificity of 72.7%, showing limited improvement compared with TSLP alone, suggesting limited added value. Moreover, this study identified serum TSLP as being independently associated with AE, suggesting that TSLP may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting AEs. TSLP (AUC = 0.768) appears to perform similarly to serum amyloid A (AUC = 0.789) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.762) for the prediction of AECOPD progression ( 31 31 32 33 33 This study had limitations. It was an observational study with a small sample size. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, the study could only rely on the data available in the charts, and reliable data were missing for too many patients, which could not be used for analysis. Hospitalization in patients with COPD can be used as a surrogate of AE events, as suggested by the literature ( 14 17 In conclusion, high serum TSLP levels are associated with an increased risk of AECOPD. The predictive value of IL-33 for AE risk is relatively low, but its high sensitivity suggests potential value. Serum TSLP has a relatively high predictive value. TSLP could be a key biomarker and therapeutic target for AECOPD. Further in-depth, larger-scale, real-world studies are necessary to determine the role of TSLP in controlling AE risk, alleviating lung function decline, improving the quality of life, and prognosis for COPD patients.
