Viral infections pose a major threat to global health, causing severe pneumonia, meningitis, hepatitis, and fatal complications. Viruses are highly dependent on host cellular factors to complete their life cycle, and host proteases, as one of the core regulatory hubs, profoundly influence the progression of infection and pathogenicity. Viruses rely on specific host proteases (e.g., transmembrane serine proteases [TMPRSS family], furin, cathepsins, and others such as caspases and metalloproteases) to precisely cleave and activate viral surface glycoproteins and internal precursor proteins, thereby facilitating efficient invasion, replication, release, and immune evasion. Meanwhile, host proteases participate bidirectionally in immune regulation. They can be exploited by viruses to exacerbate pathological damage (e.g., triggering cytokine storms), yet also act as key defense components by directly cleaving viral proteins to inhibit infection. Different viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to hijack host proteases, whose activity, specificity, and tissue distribution directly determine the viral tissue tropism and pathogenic potential. Compared to highly mutable viral targets, host proteases serve as ideal targets for developing host-directed antiviral drugs (HADs) due to their genetic stability and conserved mechanisms, but their toxicity requires careful evaluation because of their physiological roles. Inhibitor strategies targeting host proteases have demonstrated promising breakthrough potential in circumventing drug resistance and exerting broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against diverse viruses. Elucidating the multidimensional roles of host proteases in infection is crucial for designing the next-generation of broad-spectrum, anti-drug resistance antiviral strategies. This review systematically summarizes the regulatory mechanisms of host proteases at various stages of viral infection and advances in targeted intervention strategies, providing theoretical support for the development of resistance-resistant and broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics. host proteases viral infection immune response regulatory mechanism broad-spectrum antiviral agents Health Commission of Chengdu Municipality 10.13039/100031514 The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

During this process, host proteases, as key enzymes responsible for protein degradation and modification, serve as pivotal regulators at every infection stage, positioning them as high-potential breakthrough targets. Their core value is first evidenced by conserved cleavage mechanisms across viral families. Furin mediates the cleavage of HIV envelope glycoprotein gp160 into gp120/gp41 subunits to initiate membrane fusion ( 12 13 14 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Despite the substantial potential of host proteases as antiviral targets, their intrinsic biological properties pose significant challenges for targeted interventions. The same protease often exhibits functional pleiotropy in distinct infection contexts. For example, furin enhances viral particle maturation in HIV infection ( 28 29 30 31 31 32 33 34 35 36 34 This review focuses on the multifaceted roles of host proteases in viral infections, systematically outlining their core functions across four key stages. These stages include viral entry activation, replication and assembly, release and dissemination, and immune evasion. It also provides an in-depth assessment of innovative intervention strategies targeting these proteases. By analyzing the multiple functions of these proteases, this review aims to pioneer novel therapeutic approaches to suppress viral transmission and pathogenicity and provide a new perspective and theoretical basis for future viral therapeutic research. 2 Classification and function of host proteases Host proteases serve as key effector molecules in virus-host interactions, exerting multifaceted regulatory roles via the viral life cycle through specific peptide bond hydrolysis. Their primary functions include (1) cleavage and activation of viral precursor proteins (e.g., glycoproteins, polyproteins) to confer infectivity or replication capacity; (2) modulation of host signaling pathways to alter cellular states for viral replication or immune evasion; and (3) remodeling of the extracellular matrix or membrane structures to create a favorable microenvironment for viral entry, assembly, or dissemination. Specifically, viruses have evolved a three-pronged strategy to manipulate this system: (i) targeted exploitation of tissue- or cell-specifically expressed protease isoforms [e.g., TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in the respiratory epithelium ( 37 38 39 40 2.1 Serine proteases Serine proteases are characterized by a highly conserved Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad ( 41  Figure 1A 42 40 Figure 1 Three-dimensional structures and catalytic center characteristics of three types of core host proteases.

Aspartic proteases utilize an active center formed by two conserved aspartic acid residues (Asp) ( 50 51 52 53 54 From a molecular evolutionary perspective, the functional diversity of host proteases reflects a dynamic equilibrium forged through protracted virus-host coevolution.

Conformational activation of viral surface glycoproteins, driven by host protease-mediated site-specific proteolytic cleavage, constitutes the essential initial step in the infection cascade. This regulatory strategy exhibits remarkable viral specificity and evolutionary adaptability. 3.1.1 Host protease-dependent activation mechanisms of influenza viruses The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein functions as the principal mediator of viral entry, and its proteolytic processing determines infection efficiency, exhibiting significant subcellular localization specificity and viral subtype dependency. The HA precursor (HA0) must be cleaved by host proteases to generate HA1/HA2 subunits, thereby exposing the N-terminal fusion peptide (GLFGAIAGFIE) and enabling the virus to acquire membrane fusion capability—it is particularly emphasized that although uncleaved HA0 can bind to sialic acid receptors on host cells, it completely loses the ability to drive membrane fusion ( 38 39 55 56 55 57 58 62 59 60 63 58 62 64 65 66 ST14 65 67 70  Figure 2A 37 71 71 Figure 2 Differences in the host protease-dependent invasion mechanisms of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. (A) (B) Illustration comparing influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms. Panel A shows the influenza virus binding to cell membrane receptors leading to endocytosis and subsequent viral fusion and replication involving cellular enzymes. Panel B depicts SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 receptors, followed by membrane fusion, RNA release, and replication through the endoplasmic reticulum. Both panels highlight key enzymes and pathways like TMPRSS2, furin, and CTSL/B involved in viral processing. Influenza C virus (ICV) employs a distinct mechanism, wherein its hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) fusion protein, which has dual functions in receptor binding and destruction, strictly relies on TMPRSS2 for activation on the cell membrane surface ( 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 3.1.2 Multi-layered host protease regulatory networks orchestrate coronavirus invasion Coronavirus entry is governed by the spatiotemporal coordinated activation of the spike (S) glycoprotein through host protease interplay. In SARS-CoV-2, priming cleavage at the S1/S2 junction (multibasic PRRAR motif) by furin and TMPRSS2 within the Golgi apparatus enhances virion maturation and infectivity ( 18 19 82 83 20 21 84 85 87  Figure 2B 88 89 90 Host proteases exhibit functional divergence in viral invasion. TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS13 play central roles in both virus-cell fusion and subsequent cell-cell fusion stages. In contrast, HAT and differentially expressed in squamous cell carcinoma gene 1 (DESC1) show significantly weaker activation efficiency in these two fusion processes ( 91 92 93 97 98 99 100 101 103 3.1.3 Host protease utilization strategies in other viral families The utilization of host proteases represents a universal strategy for both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses during invasion (  Figure 3 12 104 105 14 17 106 107 108 109 108 Paramyxoviridae 110 115 116 Figure 3 Multinodal regulation of viral life cycles by host proteases. Viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 hijack host proteases (e.g., TMPRSS2, furin) during the stages of entry, replication, assembly, and release, achieving infection through a multi-node regulatory pattern. Illustration of the viral lifecycle showing entry, uncoating, genome replication, translation, assembly, and release processes. It includes specific proteins and enzymes involved, such as TMPRSS2, CTSL, and Furin, with pathways for direct fusion, non-lytic, and lytic release. The image details interactions with receptors and various viral components in each step. Among non-enveloped viruses, HPV relies on furin-mediated cleavage of the minor capsid protein L2. The released C-terminal peptide (L2CT) not only mediates viral genome escape from endosomes but also recruits the nuclear transport factor karyopherin alpha2 (KPNA2) to guide DNA across the nuclear membrane barrier ( 13 117 118 Reoviridae 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 Alphaviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), rely on furin-mediated processing of their envelope protein precursor E3E2 to form functional E2-E1 heterodimers. The receptor-binding activity of these heterodimers, together with low pH-induced conformational instability, collectively drives the viral membrane fusion process. Geographic isolation has driven the evolutionary divergence of protease utilization. African strains specifically depend on membrane-bound cilia proteases and PC5B for cleavage of E3E2 at the HRQRR 64 64 126 127 3.2 Dynamic regulatory mechanisms of host proteases in viral replication and assembly Host proteases precisely regulate viral replication and assembly through specific cleavage events, exhibiting multidimensional coordination and dynamic evolutionary characteristics. During the viral replication phase, host proteases play a central role in regulating key processes, such as the activation of viral precursor proteins and the formation of replication complexes (  Figure 3 128 129 130 27 131 During virus assembly, host proteases primarily exert precise regulation by mediating the modification and maturation of viral structural proteins. The nucleocapsid protein (N) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and IAV loses its genome-binding capacity after caspase-6/7 cleavage, resulting in a dramatic decrease in infectious virus particle yield ( 132 133 134 79 135 136 137 138 The host-virus interaction network at the protease level is characterized by dynamic interplay and coevolution. Host factors, such as TRAB domain-containing protein 2A (TRABD2A), can inhibit viral assembly by degrading the Gag protein of HIV-1 ( 139 140 141 142 3.3 Diverse regulatory mechanisms of host proteases in viral release and transmission Host proteases profoundly enhance viral particle release and transmission efficiency through precise regulation of viral maturation and microenvironment remodeling (  Figure 3 28 29 30 143 Viral cell-to-cell transmission involves a more extensive proteolytic regulatory network.

The precise regulation of host protease activity by host factors constitutes a critical mechanism in antiviral defense. Interferon-induced guanylate binding proteins (GBPs, such as GBP2 and GBP5) inhibit furin and PCSK family activity, impeding the maturation of viral envelope glycoprotein precursors, including HIV-1 gp160, and significantly reducing the infectivity of various viruses, including HIV-1, ZIKV, MV, and IAV ( 150 151 152 154 155 156 157 The functions of host proteases frequently exhibit tissue- and cell-compartment specificity, and profoundly influence systemic immune responses. In renal cells, SARS-CoV-2 evades the inhibitory effect of the host restriction factor nuclear coactivator 7 (NCOA7) via a TMPRSS2-mediated non-endosomal pathway ( 158 159 22 160 161 The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family exhibits complex and differentiated functions in viral immunomodulation. In HBV infection, MMP-9 promotes viral replication and hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting interferon signaling ( 46 in vivo in vitro 162 163 164 165 23 166 Complement system regulation represents another critical battleground for viral immune evasion. Aberrant interactions between the mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2) and the SARS-CoV-2 N protein drive complement hyperactivation, fueling cytokine storms and multiorgan damage—a mechanism particularly prominent in severe COVID-19 ( 167 26 168 169 170 171 4 Antiviral intervention strategies targeting host proteases: from single-target inhibition to multidimensional synergistic regulation Compared with the drug resistance challenges posed by high-frequency mutations in viral genomes, host proteases, due to the high genetic stability of their encoding genes, emerge as highly attractive targets for developing host-directed antiviral drugs (HADs). This approach significantly mitigates risks of viral escape mutations. Furthermore, inhibitors targeting host proteases generally exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral potential, providing a feasible approach to combat multiple viral infections. With the deepening understanding of the viral infection complexity and immune evasion mechanisms, intervention strategies targeting these critical regulatory nodes in the viral life cycle are dynamically evolving from traditional single-target inhibition to multidimensional synergistic regulation. 4.1 Continuous advancement in single-target inhibition research Currently, research on single-target inhibitors targeting key host proteases continues to deepen. Small-molecule inhibitors remain the primary focus due to their favorable drugability and high maturity in development. In the field of targeting transmembrane serine proteases, the TMPRSS2 inhibitor nafamostat (  Figure 4A 20 172 173 174 175 176 177 K i 178 179 Figure 4 Active site binding modes of host protease-inhibitor complexes.

Classical cysteine protease inhibitors targeting CTSL demonstrate broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy. In vitro  Figure 4B 20 83 180 181 50 127 In vivo 121 87 182 Furin inhibitor development has achieved significant advances across multiple fronts. The competitive inhibitor dec-RVKR-cmk can block F protein cleavage and viral budding of RSV ( 137 183 184 185 186 83 187  Figure 4C 188 in vivo 189 190 30 186 In addition to small-molecule inhibitors, peptide-based compounds, endogenous regulatory factors, and biologics serve as vital complements to single-target inhibition strategies due to their targeting specificity and biocompatibility advantages. In peptide inhibitor research, polyarginine repeat sequences function as competitive inhibitors of furin substrate cleavage, effectively inhibiting HIV infection by blockade of gp160 protein processing ( 191 192 193 194 195 150 28 149 101 196 4.2 Translational breakthroughs in inhibitor synergy strategies Multi-target synergistic strategies are overcoming the limitations of single-inhibitor therapies. Clinical studies have shown that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor N-0385, when combined with the antiviral drugs remdesivir or nirmatrelvir, exhibits broad-spectrum synergistic activity against Omicron subvariants ( 174 197 198 199 200 4.3 Innovative waves in multi-target drug development Dual- and multi-target therapeutics are spearheading novel antiviral strategies. Compound BAPA exhibits an EC 50 201 202 203 204 50 205 89 Structure-guided design has achieved pivotal breakthroughs. The α-ketoamide inhibitors 14a/14b exhibit potent broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral activity through covalent binding to CTSL and calpain-1 (CAPN1), achieving exceptional potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants (EC 50 206 207 66 208 K i 209 210 pro 211 4.4 Translational challenges and cutting-edge strategies Despite extensive development of host protease inhibitors demonstrating antiviral potential in preclinical models, few have successfully transitioned to clinical application. The current translational bottlenecks primarily stem from three key challenges. First, host compensatory escape—viruses can not only bypass inhibition by activating functionally redundant host proteases, such as SARS-CoV-2 switching from TMPRSS2-dependent entry to CTSL-mediated invasion pathways ( 85 87 212 213 pro 214 215 It is noteworthy that multi-target synergistic strategies aimed at enhancing antiviral efficacy, such as dual-target proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders, may increase off-target risks due to the expanded range of target molecules. Current research seeks breakthroughs through two precision-optimized design approaches. One leverages spatial precision by confining activity release ranges using tissue-microenvironment-responsive carriers ( 216 217 5 Conclusion Viral infections can trigger various severe diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, hepatitis, and cardiovascular diseases, posing a significant threat to human health. The regulatory role of host proteases in viral infections has transcended traditional understanding. As one of the core dynamic hubs in the virus-host interaction network, these enzymes not only directly drive critical processes, including viral entry, replication, and immune evasion, but also profoundly reshape infection progression through spatiotemporal activity regulation. Viruses typically hijack host protease activity to facilitate infection, with their specificity and activity directly determining viral pathogenicity. Research has elucidated three core viral evolutionary strategies enabling cross-species transmission—hijacking tissue-enriched proteases (e.g., TMPRSS2 in respiratory epithelial cells); inducing abnormal activation of microenvironment proteases (e.g., inflammation-driven MMP-9 overexpression); and optimizing adaptability of cleavage sites (e.g., the PRRA motif in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein). These mechanisms provide molecular foundations for understanding viral pathogenicity variations. In therapeutic development, host protease targeting is transitioning from single-inhibition approaches toward multidimensional synergistic paradigms. Innovative designs, including dual-target PROTAC degraders, allosteric inhibitors, and intelligent delivery systems, mark a significant turning point in the field. However, clinical translation encounters three persistent challenges—host compensatory escape mechanisms, off-target toxicity, and delivery barriers. Future breakthroughs require a focus on space-conformation precision technologies, such as employing microenvironment-responsive carriers to restrict active compound distribution or designing selective binding to inactive states of proteases based on allosteric sites, thereby balancing efficacy with physiological safety. Looking forward, host protease-targeted therapy progress will focus on three interconnected dimensions. At the mechanism-elucidation level, cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulations reveal dynamic conformational changes of protease-substrate complexes (e.g., the transient intermediates formed during furin cleaves the S protein), providing atomic-resolution blueprints for allosteric inhibitor design. At the technological development level, an AI-driven multi-target degradation agent screening for multi-target degraders integrates, host proteomics and viral evolution data to predict optimal target combinations (e.g., the combined intervention of TMPRSS2 and CTSL). At the clinical translation level, it requires establishing tiered organoid-animal model evaluation systems to assess tissue-specific toxicity in human-mimetic microenvironments (e.g., the long-term consequences of prostate TMPRSS2 suppression), alongside exploring sequential therapies against viral escape. The paramount value of these advances lies not only in significantly reducing the risk of target mutation-driven drug resistance—the genetic stability of host proteases makes them an “anchor” for controlling highly variable viruses (such as HIV and DENV)—but also in providing broad-spectrum countermeasures for emerging viral outbreaks. From respiratory to neuroinvasive viruses, host protease-targeting strategies are transforming antiviral development paradigms. Realizing this vision demands deep integration of virology, structural biology, and nanomedicine. Consequently, developing novel intervention strategies targeting host proteases holds broad application prospects and significant research value in the field of antiviral therapy.
