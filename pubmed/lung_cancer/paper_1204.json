Introduction IBDs are a complex of chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the intestine whose incidence and prevalence are increasing steadily all over the world and whose impact on everyday life is dramatic [ 1 2 Although the precise etiology of IBD is still only poorly defined, a central role in its pathogenesis is played by the dysregulation of the gut barrier function and by the continuous recruitment of leukocytes from the circulation to inflamed tissues [ 3 4 + 5 6 7 + + 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Moving from these grounds, our group has recently developed compound MR120 Figure 1 14 14 15 MR120 16 MR120 MR452 1 17 Figure 1 18 Building on these premises, the present study aims to investigate the potential protective action of MR120 MR452 19 high + −/− 20 + − + 21 + 22 MR120 MR452 2.

Discussion Accumulating evidence indicates that a central role in IBD pathogenesis is played by the dysregulation of immune response against luminal antigens through a defective epithelial barrier and under the influence of various environmental triggers [ 23 24 25 19 26 Following the application of subacute TNBS-induced colitis and chronic DSS-induced model, the benzofuran derivative MR120 16 MR120 MR452 18 In the present study, we evaluated MR120 MR452 23 + + + 27 In our conditions, the intraperitoneal infusion of CD4 + − + 21 + + INF-γ 28 29 In this in vivo model, the administration of MR120 MR452 IL-17 MR452 + + MR120 MR452 + − Interesting reports from the literature showed that the transfer of CCR6 −/− Rag2 −/− −/− 28 30 CCR6 MR120 31 32 In conclusion, our findings show that, despite the beneficial effects played by MR120 14 15 MR120 MR452 MR120 MR452 + 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animals Male Balb/c (6–8 weeks old, weighing 25–30 g) and C.B-17 SCID (6 weeks old, weighing 18–25 g) mice (Charles River Laboratories, Calco, Italy), were housed five per cage and maintained under standard conditions at our animal facility (Balb/c mice) or bred under SPF conditions in a ventilated cabinet (C.B-17 SCID mice) (12:12 h light–dark cycle, water and food ad libitum, 22–24 °C). All appropriate measures were taken to minimize pain or discomfort of animals. All the experimental procedures (induction of colitis, daily monitoring of the disease) and euthanasia by CO 2 4.2.

Experimental Design As showed by Figure 8 + 2 Mice were assigned through block randomization to the sham group (S; n n MR120 n MR452 n The dosage of MR120 15 MR452 MR120 MR452 4.4. Evaluation of Inflammatory Responses Body weight, stools consistency, and rectal bleeding were examined and registered weekly throughout the experimentation by unaware observers, in order to assess the Disease Activity Index (DAI). Immediately after sacrifice, the macroscopic damage of colonic mucosa was assessed as macroscopic score after visual inspection. Colon, lungs, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected for subsequent microscopic, biochemical, or flow cytometry analyses. 4.4.1. Disease Activity Index (DAI) The DAI, expressing the severity of the disease, is calculated as the total score resulting from body weight loss, rectal bleeding, and stool consistency according to Cooper’s modified method [ 33 The scores were quantified as follows: ○ Stool consistency: 0 (normal), 1 (soft), and 2 (liquid); ○ Rectal bleeding: 0 (no bleeding), 1 (light bleeding), and 2 (heavy bleeding); ○ Body weight loss: 0 (<5%), 1 (5–10%), 2 (10–15%), 3 (15–20%), 4 (20–25%), and 5 (>25%). 4.4.2. Colon Length and Thickness To evaluate the deposition of fibrotic material induced by the inflammatory state, colon length and weight were measured, and the thickness was estimated by calculating the ratio weight (mg)/length (cm) [ 34 4.4.3. Macroscopic Score The colon was explanted, opened longitudinally, flushed with saline solution and macroscopic score was immediately evaluated through inspection of the mucosa, performed by two investigators unaware of the treatments applied. Macroscopic score was determined according to previously published criteria [ 35 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4.4.4. Spleen/Body Weight Ratio Spleen/body weight ratio was determined as a marker of systemic inflammation. Following sacrifice, the spleen was weighed and the weight was normalized with respect to animal body weight (BW): the ratio was expressed as spleen (mg) × 1000/BW (g). 4.4.5. Colon and Lung MPO Activity MPO activity, marker of tissue granulocytic infiltration, was determined according to Ivey’s modified method in colon and lungs [ 36 2 2 2 4.4.6. Flow Cytometry Assays Isolation of Splenocytes After sacrifice, the spleen was removed, mechanically dispersed through a 100 μm cell-strainer, and washed with PBS containing 0.6 mM EDTA (PBS-EDTA). The cellular suspension was then centrifuged at 1500 RCF for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet re-suspended in PBS-EDTA, incubated with 2 mL of NH 4 4 3 37 Isolation of Mesenteric Lymph Nodes (MLNs) After sacrifice, harvesting of the whole MLN chain located in the mesentery of proximal colon was performed. The explanted tissue was rinsed with PBS, vascular and adipose tissues were removed to isolate MLN, mechanically dispersed through a 100 μm cell-strainer and washed with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 5% FCS. The obtained suspension was centrifuged at 1500 RCF for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was washed with HBSS containing 5% FCS and re-suspended in 3 mL cell staining buffer. Finally, the cellular suspension was stained with fluorescent antibodies. Immunofluorescent Staining Prior to staining with antibodies, 200 µL of cellular suspension was incubated with IgG1-Fc (1 µg/10 6 6 6 -ve Figure S1 Samples were analyzed using InCyte™ software, version 2.6 (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Cell populations were defined as follows: lymphocytes gated in the FSC-SSC plot (FSC low/SSC low) ( Figure S2 + + + + + + 4.4.7. Analysis of Inflammatory Cytokines ELISA Assays After homogenization in PBS containing a protease inhibitor cocktail of 10 μL/mL and EDTA 5 mM, colonic tissue was frozen–thawed for 10 min in liquid nitrogen and 15 min in a 37 °C water bath for 2 cycles, and the samples were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing the inflammatory cytokines CCL20, IL-6 and IL-1β, was assayed by means of available commercial ELISA kits [CCL20: Mouse MIP-3a ELISA Kit (Wuhan Fine Biotech Co., Ltd.; Wuhan, Cina); IL-6: Mouse IL-6 ELISA Kit (RayBiotech, Peachtree Corners, GA, USA); IL-1β: Mouse Interleukin 1β ELISA Kit (Cusabio, Houston, TX, USA)]. The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm and expressed as ng/g of proteins present in each sample. The protein concentration of each sample was determined through the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Briefly, 15 μL of supernatant was made to react with 200 μL of BCA mix reagent and, after an incubation of 30 min, the absorbance was determined spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted from murine colons using Qiagen RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified using a NanoQuant PlateTM in an Infinite M Nano Machine (TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland). An amount of 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) and amplified using OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The following primers, purchased from Life Technologies (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), were used: ○ HPRT: TCAGTCAACGGGGGACATAAA (sense) GGGGCTGTACTGCTTAACCAG (antisense) ○ CCL20: TCTTGACTCTTAGGCTGAGG (sense) CAGAAGCAGCAAGCAACTAC (antisense) ○ IL-17: CCCTGGACTCTCCACCGCAA (sense) TCCCTCCGCATTGACACAGC (antisense) ○ INF-γ: TGAACGCTACACACTGCATCTTGG (sense) CGACTCCTTTTCCGCTTCCTGAG (antisense) All constructs were amplified applying the thermal cycler conditions suggested by QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Handbook (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and acquired with ChemiDoc Imaging System following RedSafe staining and analyzed by Image Lab software, version 5.0. Finally, mRNA levels were normalized with respect to the levels of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HPRT 4.5. Statistics All data were presented as mean ± SEM. Comparison among experimental groups was made using analysis of variance (one-way or two-way ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni’s post-test, a conservative post-test commonly applied to groups with equal size, when p 4.6.
