Odors play a fundamental role in human physiology and can significantly influence behavior and psychological states. Thus, the widespread use of scented candles represents not only a cultural tradition but also a practice with potential physiological and psychological implications ( 1 2 Scented candles, like other common indoor sources such as furniture, construction materials, and fragrance-containing products, contribute to the overall burden of indoor emissions. These sources release complex mixtures of odorous chemicals, which can interact in unpredictable ways and affect human health ( 3 4 2 5 Among these sources, scented candles are of particular concern due to their widespread use to mask unpleasant odors and create specific atmospheres, with the market for these products growing rapidly ( 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 This study presents a comprehensive in vivo α α 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Animals and experimental design A total of 54 healthy male Wistar albino rats (8–10 weeks old, 180–200 g) were randomly assigned to nine groups ( n The experimental protocol adhered to institutional and international guidelines and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cairo University (CU-IACUC) under approval number CUIF 2825. Groups 1–3 were used as control groups and were housed in a non-sealed, well-ventilated room. Groups 4–6 were exposed daily to emissions from a single unscented candle for 1, 3, or 6 h, respectively. Groups 7–9 were exposed daily to emissions from a single scented candle for 1, 3, or 6 h, respectively. All exposures were conducted 5 days per week for eight consecutive weeks. The unscented and scented candles used were commercially available products purchased from a major retail store in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. Exposure sessions were conducted in a sealed, air-conditioned room (3 m × 3 m × 2.8 m), simulating enclosed indoor environments common in the Gulf region. Room temperature (22 ± 2°C) and humidity were continuously monitored and maintained. To ensure consistent exposure, the distance between the burning candle and the rat cages was kept constant across all exposure groups. After each daily exposure session, the animals were returned to the animal facility and maintained under standard laboratory conditions for the remainder of the day. At the end of the eight-week exposure period, animals were anesthetized, and blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture for serum preparation. The left lung was excised and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses, while the right lung was snap-frozen and stored at −80°C for subsequent biochemical and molecular assessments. 2.2 Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis The sample was extracted by solid phase microextraction (SPME) for 20 min at 50°C and injected into GC. The GC–MS system (Agilent Technologies) was equipped with gas chromatograph (7890B) and mass spectrometer detector (5977A) at Central Laboratories Network, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt. The GC was equipped with HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness). Analyses were carried out using Hydrogen as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min at a splitless injection mode, and the following temperature program: 50°C for 0 min; rising at 5°C /min to 200°C and held for 0 min; rising at 20°C /min to 280°C and held for 6 min. The injector and detector were held at 250°C, 320°C. Mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV; using a spectral range of m/z 50–600 and solvent delay 0 min. The mass temperature was 230°C and Quad 150°C. Identification of different constituents was determined by comparing the spectrum fragmentation pattern with those stored in Wiley and NIST Mass Spectral Library data. 2.3 In silico The determination of ADMET properties is essential not only in drug discovery but also in evaluating the potential health risks associated with environmental exposures. In this study, we assessed the ADMET profiles of VOCs emitted from both unscented and scented candles. The chemical structures of the VOCs were drawn and converted into SMILES format using ChemDraw Ultra, then submitted to the ADMET lab 2.0 online prediction platform. This in silico analysis provided insights into the physicochemical properties and potential biological effects of the VOCs, thereby contributing to the toxicological evaluation of candle emissions. 2.4 Assessment of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers Systemic inflammatory markers were measured in serum, while oxidative stress markers were evaluated in lung tissue homogenates. Twenty milligrams of lung tissue was finely chopped using scissors and placed into a homogenization tube containing three steel beads. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added at a 1:9 (w/v) ratio, and the mixture was thoroughly homogenized. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was collected for analysis. The levels of oxidative stress markers were quantified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Details of the assay kits used are provided in Table 1 Table 1 List of assay kits utilized for biochemical analyses.

The absorbance ratios at 260/280 and 260/230 nm were measured using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, United States) to assess the purity and concentration of the RNA samples. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from total RNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, United States). Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and target gene expression levels were normalized to β Table 2 Table 2 Primer sequences utilized in qRT-PCR.

These findings suggest that despite clear differences in VOC composition, emissions from both scented and unscented candles may contribute to adverse health effects ( 17 Notably, decane also showed a measurable bioaccumulation factor, indicating its potential to persist in lipid-rich tissues and contribute to chronic exposure risks, particularly with repeated or long-term inhalation. Furthermore, the low aqueous solubility of many identified compounds—such as hexadecane—suggests that, once deposited in biological systems, their elimination via aqueous-phase excretion (e.g., renal clearance) may be limited. This physicochemical property is known to increase the risk of bioaccumulation, as reported in earlier studies ( 18 19 Of particular concern are compounds with predicted BBB permeability, such as heptanal and 2-decanone, which may cross into the central nervous system (CNS) and exert neurotoxic effects. This aligns with previous studies indicating that airborne aldehydes and ketones can cause CNS depression and cognitive impairment at sufficient concentrations ( 20 21 22 23 24 GC–MS analysis of scented candle emissions revealed a diverse and chemically complex profile, with 60 volatile compounds identified per candle. Consistent with these findings, in-silico ADMET evaluations flagged several compounds as potentially hazardous, highlighting their capacity for bioaccumulation, membrane permeability, or organ-specific toxicity. Among these, methylene chloride was identified and is recognized for its acute toxicity and carcinogenic potential ( 25 26 27 in vivo 28 Several aldehydes, such as citronellal and 2,4-heptadienal, triggered structural alerts in silico, suggesting potential for protein binding and sensitization due to their chemical reactivity—an interpretation supported by previous studies reporting similar effects for reactive aldehydes ( 29 30 31 4.2 Pro-inflammatory response induced by candle emissions The biological significance of these findings was evidenced by the marked elevation of serum TNF- α 12 32 33 4.3 Impact of candle-derived VOCs on pulmonary oxidative stress The current study demonstrated a significant oxidative imbalance in lung tissues of rats exposed to both unscented and scented candle emissions, as indicated by elevated MDA levels and reduced activities of CAT and T-SOD. MDA, a widely recognized marker of lipid peroxidation, increased significantly in a time-dependent manner, with the most pronounced effect observed in the scented candle group. This elevation reflects enhanced oxidative degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes, likely driven by excessive ROS production ( 34 35 36 Conversely, the activities of CAT and T-SOD—key enzymatic antioxidants involved in ROS detoxification—were significantly suppressed in both candle-exposed groups, with the scented candles exerting a more substantial inhibitory effect. The observed suppression of catalase activity in lung tissue following candle emission exposure is consistent with findings that catalase plays a critical role in defending against oxidative stress induced by environmental pollutants. The more severe decline in the scented candle group may be attributed to the presence of additional synthetic fragrance components, which have been associated with higher VOCs emissions and increased toxicity ( 6 37 38 4.4 Molecular and immunohistochemical evidence of pulmonary inflammation The present study demonstrated that exposure to emissions from both unscented and scented candles significantly upregulated the expression of TNF- α 39 40 4.5 Histological evidence of enhanced lung toxicity from candle exposure The histopathological results provide strong evidence that candle emissions impair lung structure in a time- and composition-dependent manner. While unscented candles produced progressive injury with longer exposure, scented candles elicited more severe effects even at shorter durations, underscoring their greater toxic potential. The lesions observed—including epithelial degeneration, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammatory infiltration—are consistent with pathological mechanisms reported in studies of indoor air pollution and VOC exposure. Such alterations are closely linked to oxidative stress, persistent inflammation, and airway remodeling, processes that contribute to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recurrent respiratory infections, and impaired lung development ( 41 5 Conclusion This study provides compelling evidence that both unscented and scented candles emit a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as demonstrated by GC–MS analysis. Several of these compounds exhibited unfavorable toxicological profiles in silico, and this was corroborated by biochemical alterations, gene expression changes, increased inflammatory markers, and progressive histopathological damage in exposed rats. Notably, scented candles produced more severe pulmonary injury, including necrosis, fibrosis, and marked inflammatory infiltration, compared with unscented candles and controls. Although these results were obtained under controlled experimental conditions, they highlight the potential toxicological risks of candle emissions and emphasize the role of everyday consumer products in contributing to indoor air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 99% of the global population is already exposed to air pollution levels exceeding international guidelines ( 42 Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
