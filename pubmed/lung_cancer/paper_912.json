However, rebiopsies are often required due to insufficient specimens for definitive pathological diagnosis and molecular testing, which increase patient burden and reduce treatment efficiency. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of rebiopsies and propose strategies to minimize unnecessary rebiopsies. Methods A total of 12,882 PTNBP cases from three centers were analyzed from January 2018 to December 2022. Attribution analysis was conducted for the rebiopsy cases, and descriptive analysis was conducted for clinical parameters. Results The rebiopsy rate was 6.5% (841/12,882), with 31.0% (261/841) of rebiopsies due to insufficient specimens. Among these cases, 87.0% (227/261) were stage III–IV, 89.7% (234/261) had poorly differentiated tumors, and 80.1% (209/261) were non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The proportion of molecular testing in stage IV cases was significantly higher than in stage I–III cases (44.8% vs. 25.3%, p p p Conclusion Patients with advanced‐stage disease, poorly differentiated tumors, and NSCLC undergoing PTNBP are more likely to require rebiopsy due to insufficient specimens. Increasing the number of biopsy cores (≥ 2) and implementing one‐stop management for pathological assessment may effectively reduce unnecessary rebiopsies in PTNBP.

We investigated the clinicopathological features of cases with insufficient specimens from multiple perspectives and proposed strategies to reduce unnecessary rebiopsies. Our findings offer valuable insights for improving clinicopathological management, reducing the rebiopsy rate, and enhancing the accuracy of pathological diagnosis in PTNBP cases, thereby better supporting the needs of clinical precision treatment. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Participants A total of 12,882 patients who underwent CT‐guided PTNBP at three institutions—Sun Yat‐sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC), Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (GDPPH), and Jiangmen Central Hospital (JMCH)—were included in this study, with a follow‐up period from January 2018 to December 2022 (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Participant enrollment procedures. 2.2 Data Collection We collected clinical and pathological data from PTNBP patients, including gender, age, lesion size, biopsy date, histology diagnosis, degree of differentiation, TNM stage, lobar location, reason for rebiopsy, hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) sections, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and special staining biomarkers, molecular testing results, and other relevant information. 2.3 Pathological Diagnosis and Slide Scanning In this study, the H&E‐stained slides of rebiopsy cases were retrospectively and the PTNBP cases prospectively reviewed by two clinical pathologists independently. H&E‐stained slides were digitized using whole‐slide imaging with a digital pathology scanner (Leica Aperio AT2). 2.4 Biopsy Technique At each participating center, biopsy procedures were primarily conducted by specialized thoracic radiologists. All biopsies were performed using an 18‐Gauge core needle within a coaxial cutting needle system (BARD MC1816, 18G × 16 cm; BioPince MCXS1815BP, 18G × 15 cm). Conventional spiral CT scanning was utilized to identify and localize the lesion. The needle insertion point and trajectory were determined using the CT laser positioning system. Following routine disinfection and application of sterile drapes, local infiltration anesthesia was administered with 2% lidocaine. Under continuous guidance by spiral CT scanning, the needle was accurately inserted through the skin into the tumor. The biopsy specimen was immediately placed in formalin fixative and sent for pathological evaluation. 2.5 Statistical Analysis GraphPad Prism 8 was employed for graph generation, while SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. An unpaired t p 3 Results 3.1 Participants A total of 12,882 patients who underwent CT‐guided PTNBP at three centers (SYSUCC, GDPPH, and JMCH) were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Among them, 841 patients underwent rebiopsy from January 2018 to December 2022, and the overall rebiopsy rate was 6.5% (841/12,882) (Figure S1 1 3.2 Reason for Rebiopsy Reasons for rebiopsy were categorized into three groups: treatment‐related factors, insufficient specimens, and benign lesions, based on a retrospective review of medical records, clinical guidelines, and expert consensus. Among the 841 patients who underwent rebiopsy, 422 (50.2%) underwent rebiopsy due to treatment‐related indications, such as disease progression, acquired drug resistance, or participation in clinical trials. A total of 261 patients (31.0%) required rebiopsy because the initial specimens were inadequate for clinicopathological diagnosis and molecular testing. Furthermore, 158 patients (18.8%) underwent rebiopsies when the initial biopsy indicated benign lesions, such as inflammatory changes, while imaging findings and clinical symptoms suggested potential malignancy (Figure S2 Among the 261 cases with insufficient specimens, 161 (61.7%) did not receive a definitive pathological classification from the initial biopsy and required rebiopsy to confirm the pathological subtype. Additionally, 85 (32.6%) patients underwent molecular detection with rebiopsy tissue because of insufficient initial specimens (Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Reason for rebiopsy due to insufficient specimens.

Cases that underwent rebiopsy due to inadequate tissue samples showed several key differences compared to those rebiopsied for treatment‐related reasons. These cases involved older patients (61.8 vs. 59.1, p p p p S1 3.4 Pathological Detection Needs of Rebiopsy Patients With Insufficient Specimens To further characterize cases with insufficient tissue, we analyzed their pathological detection needs from the aspects of H&E staining, IHC (TTF1, p40, Napsin A, CK5/6, p63, Ki‐67, etc.), and molecular detection (ALK, EGFR, ROS1, etc.). The results revealed that six sections were stained with H&E at each of the three participating centers (Figure S4A 2 S4B 2 S2 S4C 2 S2 TABLE 2 Pathological detection needs of rebiopsy patients with insufficient specimens.

The results indicated that the average number of biopsy cores in non‐rebiopsy cases was significantly higher than in rebiopsy cases (1.8 vs. 1.6, respectively, p 4A p 4B p 4C FIGURE 4 Correlation analysis between rebiopsy rate and number of biopsy cores.

Second, for lung cancer patients requiring biopsy for pathological diagnosis and molecular detection, it is recommended that pathology technicians manage the entire process of PTNBP specimen handling, including one‐stop management and operation, after receiving samples. During the sectioning process, the knife should be adjusted and aligned as accurately as possible. Multiple continuous sections should be prepared simultaneously, with 1–3 sections used for H&E staining and the others reserved for IHC and molecular detection. Fragmented tissue sections generated during rough sectioning can be collected and utilized for molecular detection. Moreover, multiple staining techniques for IHC can be considered to improve the utilization rate of sections in institutions with appropriate experimental conditions (Figure 5 FIGURE 5 Clinical practice recommendations to reduce unnecessary rebiopsy due to insufficient specimens. 4 Discussion With the widespread use of CT‐guided PTNBP in diagnosing and treating lung cancer, an increasing number of patients are undergoing multiple PTNBP procedures (rebiopsies) in clinical practice. This study retrospectively analyzed 12,882 cases of CT‐guided PTNBP across three centers, identifying a total of 841 rebiopsy cases, yielding a rebiopsy rate of 6.5%. Currently, the distribution of rebiopsy cases for different reasons has not been reported. This study summarized the distribution of rebiopsy cases based on various reasons. We found that the majority of rebiopsies (50.2%) were performed due to treatment‐related factors. Existing literature supports the necessity of rebiopsy in these cases to monitor disease progression, screen for drug resistance genes, interpret resistance mechanisms, predict therapeutic targets, and detect new tumor characteristics, thereby providing a basis for subsequent treatment decisions [ 6 7 9 14 15 16 17 Other cases (31.0%) involved rebiopsy due to insufficient specimens from the initial biopsy, inadequate for clinicopathological diagnosis or molecular detection. The reasons for insufficient tissue spanned multiple clinical and pathological processes. Providing sufficient tissue initially or optimizing tissue utilization throughout the process might help in these patients avoid rebiopsy. The analysis of clinicopathological characteristics of rebiopsy patients with insufficient specimens revealed that the interval between the first and second biopsy was significantly shorter compared to those undergoing rebiopsy for treatment, indicating the urgent need for pathology diagnosis and molecular subtyping. Most of the cases with insufficient tissue were poorly differentiated tumors (89.7%), which are notoriously difficult to diagnose and often require additional techniques such as IHC and special staining [ 12 17 18 19 17 18 19 20 The number of biomarkers used for IHC and special staining in cases with larger tumors (> 4.2 cm) was significantly higher than in those with smaller tumors (≤ 4.2 cm), which may be attributed to tumor heterogeneity. Similarly, the number of biomarkers used in poorly differentiated cases was significantly higher than in well‐to‐moderately differentiated cases, indicating the greater challenge in diagnosing poorly differentiated tumors. When NSCLC is poorly differentiated and cannot be further classified by morphology alone, IHC and special staining become essential for diagnosis. The subsequent analysis of the need for molecular testing in cases with insufficient tissue revealed that at least 38.3% of these patients required molecular testing, with at least 28.7% undergoing rebiopsy specifically for this purpose. The demand for molecular testing was significantly higher among stage IV patients compared to those in stages I–III (44.8% vs. 25.3%). Additionally, to further characterize patients with insufficient tissue, we analyzed the number of biopsy cores. The results indicated that the number of biopsy cores in non‐rebiopsy cases was significantly higher than in rebiopsy cases during the first biopsy (1.8 vs. 1.6). Furthermore, the proportion of cases with two or more biopsy cores was significantly higher in non‐biopsy cases compared to those with insufficient tissue (56.2% vs. 43.5%). The insufficiency rate for cases with only one biopsy core was significantly higher than for those with two or more cores (2.4% vs. 1.5%). These findings suggested that the relatively small amount of tissue in the first biopsy was a significant factor contributing to the need for rebiopsy. In addition, Beck et al. showed that increasing the number of biopsy specimens improved the sensitivity of pathological diagnosis for pulmonary nodules, but the improvement in diagnostic performance was not significant when the number increased from two to three [ 21 22 23 8 24 25 Our study highlighted that multistation and subcenter operations in the pathological technical process of lung biopsy samples across the three centers significantly contributed to unnecessary tissue loss. In the era of precision medicine, the multidisciplinary team (MDT) model for lung cancer is increasingly utilized, as it effectively enhances the accuracy of clinical decision‐making. Currently, the MDT members for lung cancer typically include thoracic surgeons, physicians, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, and nurses, among others. Each team member provides insights from their professional perspective [ 26 27 28 29 Pathologists mainly provide histopathological diagnoses and molecular test reports. However, there is limited discussion on managing and planning lung biopsy specimens, optimizing testing with minimal samples, or determining the best biopsy strategy for specific cases. Including pathology technicians in the lung cancer MDT, especially for advanced‐stage or atypical imaging cases, could be beneficial. These technicians, with their expertise in pathological technology, could suggest more scientific and accurate detection strategies during discussions on histological treatment and subsequent testing of lung biopsy samples. Pathology technicians can also understand the clinical diagnosis and treatment needs through MDT participation. This involvement allows them to develop scientific and reasonable plans, conduct one‐stop operations, pay attention to every detail, optimize tissue processing strategies, and maximize tissue sample use throughout the pathology assessment process. For instance, fragmented tissue can be collected during initial slicing for subsequent molecular detection. Multiple unstained slides can be continuously cut for IHC staining and molecular detection to prevent tissue loss from repeated paraffin block cutting. Additionally, double staining or multiple staining can be considered for IHC in facilities with the necessary experimental conditions, further improving section utilization. These measures not only save detection time and yield more accurate results but also help avoid unnecessary rebiopsies. The findings and recommendations from this study should be widely implemented and gradually optimized in clinical practice. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, this multicenter retrospective study systematically investigated and analyzed the clinicopathological data of PTNBP cases, providing a comprehensive examination of the challenges encountered in clinical and pathological practices of PTNBP from multiple perspectives. It highlights the necessity of whole‐process management and one‐stop operation of the pathological technology workstation for PTNBP cases. Our findings provide potentially valuable recommendations for improving clinicopathological management practices, reducing the rebiopsy rate, and enhancing the accuracy of pathological diagnosis in PTNBP cases, thereby supporting the requirements for clinical precision treatment.
