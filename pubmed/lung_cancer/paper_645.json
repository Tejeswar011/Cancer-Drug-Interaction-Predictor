Materials and methods 2.1. Ethics statement All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chongqing Medical University (approval number: IACUC-CQMU-2023-0197). 2.2. Animal experiments Male C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were selected for this study because of their high sensitivity to anthracyclines [ 16–19 n 20–22 20 22 23 24 n + + + 25 26 27 + + + 2.3. Echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on isoflurane-anaesthetised mice using the VINNO6LAB small-animal ultrasound system to assess cardiac function. M-mode echocardiograms were acquired from long and short-axis views of the left ventricle. Each index was measured and averaged over at least three cardiac cycles. The left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter, left ventricular end-systolic internal diameter, left ventricular posterior diastolic wall width, left ventricular posterior systolic wall width, diastolic septal thickness, systolic septal thickness, left ventricular anterior diastolic wall width, left ventricular anterior systolic wall width, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF%), and fractional shortening rate (FS%) were calculated. 2.4. H&E staining To observe histopathological alterations in the heart, we stained heart tissues with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Heart tissues were fixed overnight with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (#BL539A, BioSharp, Hefei, China) sectioned 4 μm thick, and routinely stained with H&E. Three pathologists blindly performed a semi-quantitative analysis of the extent of heart tissue damage. The severity of cardiac injury was scored semi-quantitatively based on the following variables in three random microscopic views: myocardial fibre disarrangement, consolidation, and wave-like changes. Each variable was scored on a scale of 0–4, with 0 = no injury, 1 = injury up to 25%, 2 = injury up to 50%, 3 = injury up to 75%, and 4 = diffuse injury [ 28 2.5. WGA staining Paraffin sections of cardiac tissue were stained with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (#L4895, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) as instructed and then observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope. Cardiomyocyte membranes were stained green, and the nuclei of the cells were stained blue. The surface area of the cardiomyocytes was measured using the ImageJ software. 2.6. ELISA Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (#ED-20716), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (#ED-20519) and creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) (#ED-27926) levels were measured by ELISA kits provided by Xiamen Lunchangshuo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. to evaluate the myocardial injury. Fresh blood samples were collected from the eyeballs of anaesthetised mice in each group and then incubated at room temperature for 2 h, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 4°C for 15 min to obtain the serum. The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 2.7. Cell culture, treatment, and transfection Two cell types were used in this study: the mouse cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1 and the adult ventricular myocyte cell line AC16. HL-1 cells were cultured in high-sugar DMEM (#L110KJ, BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) containing 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (#S660JY, BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (#CM0001, SparkJade, Shandong, China). AC16 cells were cultured in high-sugar DMEM/F12 medium (#L310KJ, BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) containing 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. The culture conditions were 5% CO 2 2.8. Cell viability assay The CCK8 reagent (#BL1055B, BioSharp, Hefei, China) was used to determine cell viability. HL-1 cells and AC16 cells were inoculated into 96-well plates at 5000 cells/well/100 μL and 3000 cells/well/100 μL, respectively, and wall-plated for 12 h. DOX was subsequently added, and incubated at 37°C for 24 or 48 h. The culture medium was discarded, and 100 μL of CCK8 prepared according to the instruction manual was added into each well, and incubated further. The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured at 1, 2, and 3 h, and cell viability was calculated. 2.9. LDH assay A lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (#A020-2-2, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) was utilised to determine cellular cytotoxicity. Briefly, the cell culture supernatant was collected, and the required reagents were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm, and LDH activity was calculated according to the formula. 2.10. SOD, GSH, and MDA assays Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (#A001-3-2) activity, glutathione (GSH) (#A006-2-1) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (#A003-2-2) contents in heart tissues and cells were detected using commercially available kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the absorbance of the samples at 450, 405, and 532 nm was determined, and SOD activity, GSH, and MDA contents in heart tissues and cells were calculated according to the formulas. 2.11. NAD + NAD + + + g 2.12. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Total RNA from cultured cells and mouse heart tissue was isolated using a Cell/Tissue Total RNA Extraction Kit (#RC112, Vazyme, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, 1 μg total RNA was used to generate the single-stranded complementary DNA with the reverse transcription kit (#R223, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Subsequently, mRNA levels were determined using BioRad CFX Manager 3.1 and 2×SYBR qPCR Master Mix (#Q711, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Mean cycle threshold (Ct) values for the PCR products were normalised to those of GAPDH. Details of the primers used are listed in Table S1. 2.13. Western blotting Total protein was extracted by homogenising heart tissues and cells in RIPA lysis buffer (#SL1020, Coolaber Science and Technology, Beijing, China), and protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (#P0012, Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes. Next, the PVDF membranes were further blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk and incubated with the primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The primary antibodies used are listed in Table S2. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (#BL001A & BL003A, Biosharp Biotechnology, Hefei, China), the immunocomplexes were visualised using ECL chemiluminescence (#BL523B, Biosharp Biotechnology, Hefei, China). Western blot bands were semi-quantitatively analysed using ImageJ software, and data are presented as the ratio of protein expression normalised to that of housekeeping proteins. 2.14. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay The upstream transcription factors regulating nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 3 (NMNAT3) were predicted using the BioPrediction website, and the results indicated that FOXO1 is an upstream transcription factor that directly regulates the expression of NMNAT3, which was further verified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (#E1960, Promega, Madison Wisconsin, USA). Briefly, the JASPAR website was used to predict the sites in the NMNAT3 promoter sequence that might bind to FOXO1, and the sequences with the top 10 relevance scores were selected to construct the NMNAT3 promoter wild-type plasmid and mutant plasmid for dual-luciferase reporter gene experiments using empty vector plasmids. The plasmids were transfected into 293 T cells, and firefly and renilla luciferase data were measured separately according to the manufacturer's instructions for the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay system. Finally, the average firefly luciferase data/renilla luciferase data were used for analysis. 2.15. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative RT-PCR (ChIP-qPCR) ChIP assay was performed using the SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP kit (#9005, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA) to verify the relationship between FOXO1 and NMNAT3 promoter. Briefly, HL-1 cells were cross-linked with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde. Cross-linked cell lysates were sonicated to shear the chromatin and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Fifty percent of each sample volume was used as an input control. The FOXO1 antibody (#2880, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA) was used as the primary antibody for immunoprecipitation. Purified DNA was analysed using qPCR. The potential binding regions between FOXO1 and the NMNAT3 promoter were predicted using the JASPAR database ( http://jaspar.genereg.net 2.16. Immunofluorescence (IF) HL-1 and AC16 cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% (w/v) PFA, permeabilised with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA. Cells were incubated with a combination of primary antibodies (Table S2) overnight at 4°C, followed by a 1-hour incubation with a mixture of fluorescent secondary antibodies (Table S2) at room temperature. Nuclei were subsequently counterstained with DAPI. Images were acquired using a Leica fluorescence microscope. 2.17. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses and data plotting were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD); ‘n’ represents the number of biological replicates. Prior to analysis, all datasets were formally assessed for compliance with the assumptions of parametric testing. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate normality, and the Levene's test (or Brown-Forsythe test) was used to assess the homogeneity of variances. Data that violated either assumption were analysed using appropriate non-parametric tests. After testing the normality and chi-square of the values, two independent groups were compared using Student's t-test, whereas multiple groups were compared using a one-way ANOVA. P P **P P P 3.

The DOX-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) protein was significantly reduced in HL-1 cells (Figure S1D), AC16 cells (Figure S1E), and mouse heart tissues (Figure S1F). Further examination of the protein and gene expression of NRF2-regulated downstream antioxidant factors revealed that the protein and gene expression of NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were significantly decreased in DOX-treated HL-1 cells (Figure S1G), AC16 cells (Figure S1H), and mouse heart tissues (Figure S1I).

FOXO1 regulates NMNAT3 in DIC To further elucidate the signalling pathway of NMNAT3 in DIC, we investigated the upstream transcription factors that may regulate NMNAT3 expression. After screening, we selected FOXO1 for subsequent experiments. The results of the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that FOXO1 significantly inhibited the expression of NMNAT3, and that FOXO1-binding sites still existed outside the top 10 sites in the correlation score ranking ( Figure 9 Figure 9 29 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9.

Discussion Doxorubicin (DOX) remains the most clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agent and is associated with dose-limiting cardiotoxicity [ 33 34 + + + + + + + NAD + + 35 36 + 37 38 + 39 + 14 in vivo in vitro + + 40–44 + 14 45 + 14 46 + + 1/2 + 25 + + 41 47 + + 48 + 49 + + In mammals, all known pathways of NAD + + 50 + + + + 51–53 + 54 55 56 57 + + + + Although decreased NMNAT3 expression has been confirmed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of DIC, its upstream regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. We therefore performed bioinformatic analyses to predict potential regulatory molecules, and identified FOXO1 as a predicted regulator of NMNAT3 expression. The FOXO1 protein is a transcription factor containing a conserved DNA-binding structural domain, called the forkhead structural domain, which binds specific double-stranded DNA sites, namely the DAF-16 binding element and the insulin response element [ 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 58 65 This study had several limitations.
